B001S86J2Q|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 4 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />blu was good, although visually there were some soft shots scenes that disappointed me, probably due to the source and age of the material.<br />soundtrack was great.<br />a great improvement over the dvd released overall and still enjoyable after all these years.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The gameplay in this one is WAY smoother than the original on Android. Very nice. I'm glad there are no ads also. Twenty five word minimum on this review is kinda lame, amazon...

B00111L0MY|3.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 3.5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />for such a class movie, blu ray quality really sucks, big time. quality started off great, sharp images and great sound , then all of<br />a sudden, in  a lot of scenes there was just so much film grain in certain scenes really made me want to just turn off the movie,<br />studio lapsed in putting out such a down graded reproduction of an exceptionally great film that the idiot in charge of releasing should be fired.<br />was going to dump my dvd but i think i'll hold onto it for a while longer until a real re-mastered blu copy is released.<br />again,shame on you disney...

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Improved graphics and faster play than other Angry Birds. Very smooth on my Verizon LG Ally which is a low end phone and apps are often sluggish. No problem installing. Appears people on AT&amp;T are having the issues. don't see why people object to signing up for Amazon acct. It's not like they flood you with spam or anything. I've had an Amazon acct for years &amp; find it useful. if you enjoy a challenging game that looks greta, get this one.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great movie! Very cute. Good for kids or if you have older parents, and want to watch a movie that doesn't have any adult language or nudity, this movie fits the bill.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|After reading many of the 500+, 5 star reviews, I am left with little to say that has not already been said.  So, I'll be brief.  I thoroughly enjoyed Born To Run, it was a well written and a very informative adventure. It was a treat of a read and one that runners and non-runners alike could appreciate.
B000RGH4FQ|5.0|The pairing of Irene Papas and Vangelis Papathanassiou is an experience for the ears. Papas is an accomplished actress with a very strong voice and that inexplicable presence most of us don't have. She has acted on stage and in films, as well as singing on numerous records over the years, and for fans of progressive rock, \\"Prog,\\" if you will, she's best known for her vocal performance on Aphrodite's Child's \\"666\\" record. Uptight people malign it for a supposed satanic reference, but the text, though contemporary, is taken entirely from the Bible's Book Of Revelation. It gripes me when people call it \\"Revelations,\\" there is no \\"s.\\" It's the Revelation to John, on the isle of Patmos, the Revelation, not Revelations. In her featured piece on that record, Papas chants, groans, whispers, and sings \\"I was, I am to come, I was, I am!\\" for several minutes, edited down from an original session of a good half-hour, just her voice depicting the throes of hysteria and sexual arousal accompanied by some percussion instruments. It was very controversial at the time, declared obscene in some European countries which are more restrictive when regulating performance art. No governing body should ever control this area; the free market should dictate if it succeeds or fails. If it's good and it sells, fine. If it's corrupt and sells, it would be emblematic of a society gone wrong. You then address human behavior, but don't restrict something because certain powerful busybodies don't like it. If it's good, people will like it.<br /><br />In \\"Odes,\\" Irene Papas does a more generally appealing performance, \\"normal\\" singing as it were, and where I don't speak a word of the Greek language, I enjoy listening to this. \\"40 Braves\\" opens this set, bold, theatrical, and operatic in nature, it sets the mood. One feels like they are in a theater balcony watching some inscrutable, but unmissable stage play.<br /><br />\\"Little Orange Tree\\" is more of the same; layered, orchestrated music with Papas' voice being the perfect vehicle for this material.<br /><br />Vangelis Papathanassiou wrote and performed all the music on this release, and the first all instrumental piece, called \\"Fire Dance,\\" follows. It sounds like some odd soundtrack to some unknown film, fusing progressive and traditional sounds in a rambling performance with different moods and tempos; great headphone music.<br /><br />\\"The Kolokotronei\\" follows, an a capella vocal by Papas, and again, I don't understand a single word of this. But Greek is a nice sounding language, and her delivery is soothing; she's got a very beautiful voice.<br /><br />\\"The River\\" has this otherworldly vibe to it, very serene, an ethereal picture in sound, the arrangement reminds me of something Mike Oldfield would come up with.<br /><br />\\"The Roots\\" is pure New Age, the type of music NPR used to play late on Sunday nights, definitely music to space out to. Pink Floyd cornered that market, but selections like this prove they don't occupy that area alone. It's almost Oriental in its flavor, but as it goes on, it gets more and more Floydian in nature.<br /><br />\\"Lamento\\" is an eerie-sounding dirge, a very dark and sinister mood; it could easily be the soundtrack to a scary piece of film, with its droning keyboards and heavily reverberated vocals, it's almost post apocalyptic. Very somber.<br /><br />\\"Menoussis\\" sounds Asian. it just has that kind of vibe to it. I know it's Greek, but it does sound like it could be in a pleasant Japanese movie. Most New Age music sounds like it could be soundtrack music, but listening to this, I think of Oriental movies, not a bad thing, just a consequence, intentional or not.<br /><br />Bottom line, \\"Odes\\" is a great piece of world music, often soothing, sometimes disturbing, but always of the highest caliber.the perfect vehicle for this material.

B004SBS8LA|2.0|This game isn't nearly as much fun when you're not squashing pigs! The graphics look nice and all, but it's losing its charm quickly.  Lame attempt at cross-promotion, IMO.
0767903862|5.0|Quite simply the best book on Australia I have ever read.  Bryson is better known for \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" but has obviously written many books.  I own about 10 of them and this may be my favorite! I learned so much about Australia while literally laughing out loud in airports, hotels and my own house.  I love his style of honest and funny observation and this book was the perfect marriage of information, adventure, humor and inspiration.  The facts that are truly amazing are too numerous to mention.  It has to be read and enjoyed more than once, in my opinion.  Read it.  You will laugh and learn.  And if you are not already, you will certainly become a huge fan of Bryson's travel writings.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I won't bother with a description because by now your already have an idea what this book is about. If you are a fan of history and science and the supernatural, I think you will love this book. This isn't some dumbed-down, bodice ripping, gratuitous sex scene novel. It is thoughtful and imaginative and a thoroughly fun read. I am looking forward to the sequels. I also appreciate the fact that I can share this with my teen daughter and not get squeamish about the love scenes. I appreciate the understatements in the book while still keeping the yearning love and romance. And the book is SMART. It made me want to have Google available all the time so I could look stuff up just for the heck of it. So any book that gets me thinking that much is five stars!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Like many other Droid X owners,  it DL fine but won't install.  It doesn't say how to troubleshoot. Other games load w/o sd card,  this cannot.... and I'm following the instructions. It just says click install.
0451196716|4.0|I bought this book based on a review I read.  At first I was disappointed because I expected more diverse action from the book than just walking and thought about not finishing.  After reading a bit I'd put it down then be drawn back later.  It was compelling, thought provoking and although I didn't expect to, I felt empathy and a connection to the characters.
1591843790|4.0|This March marks the 8th year I have been teaching entrepreneurship as a subject. In every group of 35 students I teach I come across a handful on fire. The wild, out of control, let me change the world fire, as well as the slow burning, smoldering, I will get through everything fire.  All I have to do is to make them see the end goal and they are generally able to figure the rest out.<br /><br />Over the years in the list of questions that students ask as I help them get their ideas closer to commercial reality the most common, the most troublesome and the most awkward question is:<br /><br />How do I sell? How do I convince people to say yes? How do I persuade them to give me a chance and a shot?<br /><br />While you can always direct them to books on marketing, business development and sales, to my knowledge no one ever wrote a book that gave you a roadmap to do all three. Typical text on marketing cover dimensions around marketing decisions (the C's and P's) or industrial or retail branding, business development talk about the art of deal making, closing and negotiating and tomes on selling talk about prospecting and lead generation. But there is hardly one book that you can point a student or a dreamer to and say read it and at least you will have a place to start.<br /><br />For example from Chapter 5 on How to Launch, pick a neat set of tools including<br /><br />a) Tell a Story.  Everyone wants to buy or share your dream, not a number.<br />b) Present the big choice first. Then the small one (the one you really want)<br />c) Reduce the number of choices. (Make it simple - thought Guy isn't sure if it works the other way round also).<br />d) Sell the salient point.<br /><br />I have always liked Guy's way of breaking the Art of the Start down to a science and his admission that it is not science. He first did it with his Art of the Start speech (the California TIECON edition). The speech is now a regular feature on day two of my classes and the framework he presents is what I use with my students to put flesh around the bones of their ideas.  For instance in the part where we help students move their concept to the real world we ask them a few qualifying questions.<br /><br />a) Why do they care about their idea and can they describe it in such a fashion that their audience can feel their passion and energy?<br />b) Why do their customers care about this product and how would they describe it?<br />c) How do they create meaning with their work and is it (or would it) be really a worthwhile use of their time, energy and life?<br /><br />As students stumble around inside themselves trying to find the right answers you can immediately tell who has been on fire and dreaming for how long.  For the dreamers and the fire people have it down pat. They know the answers before the question is even asked. For others the questions serve as a sifter that filters dreams from noise, meaning from mindless chatter.<br /><br />The questions above originated from the Art of the Start. And seeing them at work really give you a lot of respect for Guy's list of processes and checklists. Which is one way of looking at Enchantment - It's a book of checklists for dreamers. Not touchy feely, hand waving stuff but things that you can use tonight and see if Guy's trial by fire approach works for you.  Individuals like me like me who are founders and geeks in search of an algorithm to persuade and influence people so that we can go out and change the world by converting others to our cause.<br /><br />Not sell but convert; not convince but enchant.nd the bones of their ideas.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|i like this little app - it helps me remember to do things like &quot;write a review for ColorNote Notepad App&quot; and &quot;don't forget about the 25 word minimum&quot;
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome graphics and still retains the addictiveness of the first Angry Birds. And its free.   I have a T-mobile G2 and its works great on it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game runs great on my LG Ally running 2.2 froyo. It runs better than the original! Thanks Amazon for giving this gem away. WOOT!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a fantastic follow-up to the other two Angry Birds games. The changes are good steps for the game. The only problem I've come across is that the game restarts when I get a call.
0525423273|3.0|After reading all the reviews I was really expecting to like this book a lot. While it was okay, I wasn't as enamored with it as many of the other readers seemed to be. It feel like your average YA romance book to me and I thought the plot development was a little slow. We basically wait the whole book for Anna and St. Clair to hook up, in order to make that incredibly interesting you really need to have super character development and details, which I didn't believe there was. Not a bad book but not as fantastic as others have made it out to be.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Great classic style vertical shooter. Lots of levels and love that it doesn't use a clumsy tilt mechanic for controls! (You press the right or left side off the screen to move)
B004B6N13M|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT ITEM TO HAVE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE FULL SET OF 5, THERE IS \\"UP\\", \\"WALL.E\\", \\"MONSTERS INC\\", \\"TOY STORY\\", \\"TOY STORY 2\\" 5 IN TOTAL, BUT A BIT OVER PRICED, BUT HAVING THE FULL SET MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE, IF I WERE YOU I WOULD BUY ALL 5 BEFORE THE PRICES GO UP ANYMORE, AND KEEP THEM SEALED AND WITHIN 2 YEARS YOU WOULD MAKE 50% ON WHAT YOU PAID FOR THEM AS THEY ARE RARE. AND NOT MANY ABOUT, I THINK THEY CAME OUT AT COSTCO, BUT I CANT BE SURE ON THAT. SHAME THERE ISNT A TOY STORY 3 AS WELL, SO YOU HAVE THE TOY STORY SET. OH WELL. THEY ARE GOOD TO HAVE ANYWAY YOU GET A BOOK INSIDE AS WELL AS THE BLU RAY. AND THEY ARE A4 IN SIZE SO THE PACKAGE IS BIG. NOT MANY REALIZE THEY ARE A4 IN SIZE.
1591843790|5.0|My kids are 6 and 9 but this is on their shelf :-)    Once again, Guy has distilled his years of experience into an easy_to_understand action plan for success.     His advice is great for business people, budding entrepreneurs, politicians, PTA parents, non-profit organizers, and kids who want to understand how the world works.     It's also a great book if you are looking for a new job or thinking of changing jobs - you are the product, how well do you pitch yourself? How well does a potential employer pitch themselves?    If Guy comes out with a kids book, I want to be on the beta list!    B-)
044656740X|3.0|Submitted by ALEX PRONOVE IS535<br />Book Review of Rich Dad, Poor Dad April 16, 2008<br /><br />More than anything else--Rich Dad, Poor Dad--is an instructional book on Financial Literacy.<br /><br />Its lessons are presented as a captivating story--a disarming way to introduce several concepts--some of which upset established notions of wealth, its accumulation and its related aspects.<br /><br />The dichotomy of beliefs between the two fathers surfaces early in the story. The differences between their beliefs are emphasized to make the point unmistakably clear. The subjects of their difference are not trivial. These are education, work, and, in a general manner, the approach to life.<br />The remainder of the book expounds on this theme.<br /><br />Did this book make an impression on me? Yes, it did. I agree, for example, with the Rich Dad's definition of a Liability. Since reading the book, I view home ownership as the homeowners' voluntary assumption of a liability--whether they realize it or not. The recent run-up in prices from 2000 to early-2006 persuaded homeowners to treat their homes as piggybanks. No longer! Real estate appreciation barely beats inflation in the long run. Historical data supports that.<br />I enjoyed the discussion on financial statements and how they differ between an individual and a bank. Equally enlightening was my introduction to the CashFlow Quadrant.<br /><br />According to Kiyosaki, financial literacy consists of five principles.<br />1. How to make money<br />2. How to protect your money<br />3. How to budget your money<br />4. How to leverage your money<br />5. How to continuously  improve your financial IQ<br /><br />I strongly agree with his contention that our educational system is making a serious mistake by ignoring financial literacy in its curriculum. Many people would benefit from knowing those five principles, the quadrant, and even the contrarian definitions of assets, liabilities, and so forth.<br />In my opinion, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is worth reading. I don't think it has a lot of fluff. It introduces a lot of \\"heretical\\" concepts but the best thing it may do for the reader is it may open his/her mind.es a lot of \\"heretical\\" concepts but the best thing it may do for the reader is it may open his/her mind.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|I found this movie to be very engrossing and well executed until the end, when the mystery and suspense that had been progressively built up was resolved in a manner which I found entirely unsatisfying and implausible.  Because of this disappointment, I don't really have much more to say about this movie, other than mentioning that perhaps the primary lesson is that our bias towards believing what we want to believe renders us vulnerable to being deceived.  The bottom line is that I wouldn't necessarily advise against watching this movie, but beware of the problem I've noted.
1439163146|3.0|In terms of fronts in the ever shifting culture wars, actor/ intellectual -- and now author -- James Franco's short story collection, Palo Alto should be pretty weak tea.  That hasn't stopped critics from taking up sides declaring this debut alternatively \\"delectable\\" and \\"too true\\" (the pro-team) or featuring characters described as \\"mere sketches\\" and one who \\"felt the urge to grade it.  And not highly\\" (the anti).    I'm retreating from the field.  Perhaps I'm copping out (or just being honest?) by admitting that I can't separate this actor from his collection.  Let me just say that these stories are, at best, uneven.  Some declare as such it wouldn't have been published but for Franco's fame, but examining debuts(where uneven is more the rule than the exception), this is plainly not the case.  Undeniably, other don't receive such close attention, either from those who want to denigrate or those heaping on profligate praise (Perhaps they fantasize about invitations to posh parties?  Optioned novel?)    Franco studied in several top writing programs.  And it shows.  His eye for detail is excellent.  He crafts fine, sparse sentences.  This, however, doesn't make up for these stories emotional monotony; one after another they recount angst ridden teenagers suffering the tragedy of suburban life.  In and of itself, this isn't bad - teen angst is rich soil to plow - but here it's been farmed to dust.  Characters become undifferentiated, indeed, interchangeable.      Had Franco included a sampling of the best of this collection with other differently themed works - surely other people live in this zip code with richer emotional contours - Palo Alto could well have been excellent.  In \\"American History\\" a boy assigned to defend slavery in a high school debate foolishly engages in over heated rhetoric seeking to impress a girl, and in so doing reveals much of the racial strife that still lurks below the surface.  And angst.  \\"Lockheed\\" offers a meditation on growing up and what it means to be good at something.  And, of course, angst.    Even as Franco seeks to increase the energy of these stories with more and more helpings of bloody violence, these too become over used, becoming indistinguishable as his characters.  While there are plainly signs of potential here, one can only hope any future projects will include greater variety and depth.
0307454541|5.0|What a delightful whirlwind!  Stieg made Lisbeth into such a great mix of vunerability and strength I immediately fell in love with her.  Even though Mikael was an important part of the story, it really felt like Lisbeth was the main character.  The pace is fast and intriguing.  Even the international references just lend to the feel of the story.  I loved the unexpected twists and turns, and couldn't put this book down.  I've now read all three of the books and wish there were more.
B004IFYN2E|3.0|Just a quick blurb. My girlfriend and I sat down to watch this movie last night. We just wanted to<br />see a fairly action-packed well made thriller. We didn't get that. I'm sorry to say we both kind of<br />frowned afterwords and were disappointed. It was quite boring with over made-up actors and the little<br />action there was seemed too scripted.
0385339100|3.0|Well, the ending was unexpected and somewhat disappointing.  The book overall was a very fun read because it moved at a fast pace and the action kept me interested.  But some of the legal aspects weren't very realistic.  I love John Grisham as a writer and he definitely does this genre of book better than most.  I enjoyed this book for what it was, a quick, entertaining read.
0007144369|5.0|It is all here, it is all REALLY here: The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde.  His letters and interviews are not included (of course) but if you are looking for his poems, his short stories, or his plays look no further.  The book also has two wonderful introductions to Oscar's works.  One is written by his son Vyvyan and the other is written by his grandson Merlin.<br /><br />This book is practically perfect in every way except for one and that is the book is a bit small.  The size of the book is not so small that you will be severely annoyed but it is certainly not completely comfortable.  That being said, a compilation of this quality at the very least warrants the forgiveness of this one minor imperfection.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde is my favorite writer and I am very happy to own this book.

B004GF244K|5.0|If you've already seen Concert for George on dvd, the blu-ray does not have much additional material. But it does have improved picture and DTS HD Master sound. The sound alone was worth the purchase for me. The performances are all inspired, the mix fantastic, and the songs are arranged to truly honor their friend, George Harrison. It is as inspiring as it is moving, and just a touch surreal, with Dhani Harrison, looking incredibly like his father as a young man, in the center of the stage for so much of the show. The reverence with which the musicians treat the material is humbling and entirely appropriate. There really isn't a weak song or moment. The show continually builds from beginning to end, and it is very easy to connect with the obvious inspiration and love emanating from each musician. If you like the music of George Harrison, or you like any of the musicians playing in this concert, you will love Concert for George. It is simply beautiful.
0756405890|5.0|As my title suggests, I think this may be the best fantasy (any maybe of any genre) book I have ever read. I'm not going to go into any detail, as there are enough reviews which already do so, and I think anyone curious enough should just read it themselves.    The only flaw this book has, in my opinion, is that after reading it, there aren't any other other books I look forward to, save more of Patrick Rothfuss' books. I have also read The Wise Man's Fear, and it is nearly as good as The Name of the Wind, but now I stare down the barrel of a long wait for book three...

I've got Evernote on my Droid, iPad, work desktop, work laptop, personal laptop, Mac Mini, and, as a part time student, I use it through the web browser during class. I take notes once and can organize and consume the notes everywhere. It's the first app I install on a new device and the number one app I recommend to others.    The just wish they had stronger support for ink notes. It's not something that comes up much, but would be nice if it was there.    However, all said, I'd give it six stars if I could.
0393338827|4.0|Great book and an easy read.  I had to read it for a class and found it easy and surprisingly interesting.  I am a finance major so some of the concepts in the book came easy to me, but I still felt that the author does a good job of explaining topics that the average person does not know.  If you are interested in how the housing crisis started and who was able to benefit from it, pick up this book.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I guess the game is really cool but unfortunately I am not allowed to download from Germany. I am sure this would not be a technical problem nowadays. Poor show.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After going through a tedious process to setup the appstore and configure one-click, I end up with a not available in your region message. Why bother me to install and everything when amazon knows my region? Immediate uninstall.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|Used this processor for almost 2 years before I finally switched to an Intel i7. This was a great processor. Did amazing work at gaming and temperatures were always good even with the lame stock cooler. This processor was worth the $105 I paid for at the time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm an angry bird fanatic and this is by far the best one yet! graphics are great I'm loving the amazon app store with all they offer
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds with a slight twist! save the birds this time. Amazingly improved graphics that run absolutely buttery smooth on my G2. I had no problem with installs as others seem to have had. Nice to finally have ad free versions on Android!
B004SBX112|5.0|I have a Droid Incredible and unlike the other reviewer who said it's not compatible, mine works fine.  I had the free version from the Google Market installed and that worked fine as well.  This version saved the settings when installing from Amazon.      Great time killer when waiting somewhere, sitting in meetings, etc...    For those who say why pay... you pay so you don't have the ads to block your view and you don't have the lag that the ads introduce into the game.  It's about time Rovio allowed this to be purchased to remove the ads.  I'll bet the wait had to do with Amazon's market coming soon.  Rovio and Amazon obviously have a deal going.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Gameplay is good as the original. Looks prettier, but all three are basically just the same game with a different look. Android needs more developers like this.
B0049P1VHS|2.0|Humanity hasn't got a chance if these people are left.    There's terrific production values in this tv show, but super annoying major flaws of reasoning.    For example a group of survivors have made camp outside Atlanta. Only one of them carries a gun, and it's only a revolver (six shooter).    The camp consists of tents pitched anywhere. There's no sense of attempting to fortify themselves at all against attack. The tents are pitched well away from their vehicles. IF the zombies attacked they'd be wiped out in minutes    In a nation of major gun ownership the fact that only one guy has one gun with him is just stupid.    Second is the Sheriff's deputy - a survivor on the way to Atlanta.    He got a tiny petrol can - perhaps only 5 gallons. And that's it. Not even a back-up can.    He too walks around with a six-shooter, though sometimes he takes a shotgun out of the boot - what good it is there is beyond me.    I am amazed at this poor writing. Even if you watch \\"The Colony\\" a post-apocalyptic `reality show' they took with them more supplies.    The deputy, when he stumbles into the city and is surrounded by zombies makes his way into a abandoned tank. Does he try to use the weapons? No. Someone calls him on the radio. They just happen to know the frequency and that the radio is still left on. He leaves the protection of the tank to follow their radio instructions. The stupidity goes on and on.    Even the front-cover - whilst 'dramatic' is typical of the muddle-headed logic here. If people were desparate to get out of the city -they'd have used even the on-coming lanes.    If this is what's left I'd give then two weeks to survive.
B004PA50JM|3.0|Really, at this point, living in a world where R.E.M. released records like the stilted \\"Reveal\\" and absolutely lifeless \\"Around the Sun\\", I find it hard asking for a better record than \\"Collapse Into Now\\", even if it's not a classic R.E.M. record.  Sure, \\"Collapse Into Now\\" borrows moments from your favorite R.E.M. record. There is a little of the balladry that marked \\"Automatic for the People\\", the arena rocking textures of \\"Monster\\", guitar tones straight from the IRS catalog. There's even mandolin if that's your sort of thing. Apparently \\"Accelerate\\", R.E.M.'s previous studio record and the first to feature some really great tunes from the band in a long while, reminded R.E.M. how to be R.E.M. And they keep that pace here. \\"Collapse Into Now\\" is a good record, both for the band and in general, and if it's not often more than that, then well, I can live with that.  Guitarist Peter Buck and bassist Mike Mills continue to sound energized, even giving the ballads and quieter tunes some muscle, never overdoing the production or overdubs but never leaving the tracks to sound empty either. Lead singer Michael Stipe is in fine vocal form, even if lyrically he sounds a little off and less interested then he did on \\"Accelerate\\".  There are really no terrible tracks on \\"Collapse Into Now\\". Nothing here bored me, even if little floored me to lunge for the repeat button and want to hear that again, now. Longtime fans should enjoy \\"Collapse Into Now\\" because it's a good entry into their catalog. First time listeners would be well advised to take a listen also, as it paints a decent picture of the band and what they are capable of doing and have done before, even if they've done it all before, better.
B000002GLT|4.0|USA Union has an easy-going, laid-back feel to it.  Some of this can be attributed to the lack of a drummer; much of it can be attributed to the fluid bass of Larry Taylor.  Many of the songs are relationship themed.  \\"Took the Car\\" and \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" are blissful meditations on outings with a loved one.  \\"Possessive Emotions\\" examines the feelings of jealousy that can overtake a person over a lover.  \\"Crying\\" is a showcase for violinist Don Harris.    While this album lacks the drive of some of Mayall's best work (i.e., A Hard Road), USA Union is a fantastic soundtrack for a summer afternoon.  Recommended.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This is an excellent application.  I was amazed at the quality of the PDF files created by this app.  I have used this on many occasions, to include scanning completed official documents and e-mailing them back in without any problems.  Highly recommended!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was kinda expecting the same as seasons and the other a gry birds... but I was wrong and shocked how good the interface and everything was. Great game and HIGHLY recommended!
B00433TO52|4.0|I think I can say that the name Shakespeare is the most recognizable in the English language and his works definitely justify his fame. They have stood the test of time and will continue to do so. That's why it is so great to get a Kindle book like this one.  Instead of spending time trying to get everything individually and then paying for everything individually, I have everything that I could want from Shakespeare in one file. And not only the plays and poetry, but the biographies and the commentaries! I think they are the best part because I feel like I'm having a literature conversation with all these great literary minds!<br /><br />All in all, a great ebook and I hope everybody who reads this gets as much out of it as I have!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Hilarious show. Have watched the episodes numerous times and still  laugh outloud! If you like British comedy, or any type of slapstick, this is for you. Price was very good compared to the box and motar stores.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why it is for US residents only while it can be downloaded internationlly in iphone app store? It doesn't make any sense at all.     I don't mind pay for the game. Angry bird is an amazing game. It totaly worth for USD0.99. But the store don't even let me download it.     It's really stupid if amazon and rovio keep doing so.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Rio is much better than the original.. updated graphics.. no more pigs! and it runs as smooth as butter on my evo 4g.. and Amazon please remove the 25 word limit
0316098337|1.0|I agree with many of the other poor reviews - Jack's character is completely unbelievable. At times he is super articulate, using complex words and asking insightful questions. Yet just seconds later he is speaking as if he's three years old.     Overall, the premise is very interesting. That was really the only reason I finished the book. Unfortunately, the narrator is so poorly crafted, the story is almost unreadable. Definitely read a synopsis of the book, not the book.     Too bad, I had high hopes.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The app will download, but it will not install. I get a message that reads &quot;application not installed&quot; and then my only option is to click the &quot;done&quot; button. HTC Evo with Sprint.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just rooted my Inspire (ATT) today....great timing.    People need to do some research before they bash amazon and not ATT!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loving it! I adore not having the ads. If I had a bigger phone/screen, maybe those ads would be less annoying. But as it is, they block the screen. They also slow the game down and make it very laggy. So without the ads: no lag, nice smooth game play, ability to actually view the entire screen. The new 3Dish graphics are cool, too.     Definite thumbs up. If you like Angry Birds, you have to get this version!!    P.S. I have an LG Ally and did have some issues with installing... the trick with deleting the corrupt file worked. I'm not considering those issues in my 5-star rating though as that has nothing to do with game play!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why isn't it available in Europe... It says worldwide but thats not only US, right?! I bet the app is awesome, but yeah, what fun is a game when you can't play it!?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Rio expansion is great! Updated graphics and runs perfectly on droid 2. Having a new objective and theme is awesome. Completely worth a dollar.
B00000F169|3.0|Quirky, strange; but, a harbinger of things to come from the director.  Having seen all that has come after it and built on its shoulders, its a struggle to watch it through.  But, watch it as a part of the evolution of the Space Extravaganza's that we have today.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Having played all the versions of angry bird I can say that this is the best till now. much nicer graphics, sound and effects. Addictive just like the others.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thus is a very good improvement to the original and seasons. The graphics are better and it runs much smother on my Evo compared to the original. No ads blocking the view is a plus. I like the new music theme, and the new story.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|From the first sentance the book had me hooked.  Fun, Funny, interesting and LOVED the characters.  Amazing and fun.  Totally recommended.  I couldn't put it down in fact spent an entire Sunday reading.  Anxiously awaiting more Sophie Kinsella books !!!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I liked the iPhone app because it had lightning deals along with the deal of the day. This one doesn't show the lightning deals.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I love everything about Ms. Husdson.  Since her days of being dogged out by Simon and the rest on American Idol, I just knew GOD had a plan for this golden-voiced woman.  I'm really feeling the lyrical content of where she's at (pun intended) and feel like this could arguably double as a gospel album with some of the songs.  My favorites so far are \\"No One Gonna Love You\\", \\"I Got This\\", \\"Where You At?\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Everybody Need Love\\", \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"Believe\\", which I recently found was a country tune by Brooks and Dunn, *WOW*!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app all the time! Works great, simple to use, and easy to update and adjust lists as I need to. I love being able to create multiple lists for the different tasks I have: to do list, projects, shopping lists, menus for the week etc. no complaints here!
B004J4WQ46|3.0|I say there are about 4 songs i really like on this album, a couple ok songs and two songs i didn't like at all. Some of the songs while listening i personally thought they would take off and it was going to turn into a great song but I was let down a lot of the time the way the direction went on it.
B001ECQ6E2|2.0|A beautifull movie, it does not need explanation, you can read too much good things abouth this clasic. Well done for the movie.  BUT, the idea of a blu ray disk is an improvement in quallity. and here you have the same as DVD, not even a good video translation to avoid que small surface, the same ugly sound and 1.33 ratio without filling the space in my XBR LX900.  Just more money to the garbage.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I loved Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons but this one is even better. The graphics are cleaner and smoother and everything looks more polished. Fun and addictive.
0061134007|4.0|Voted the \\"best crime novel ever written in Norway\\" by Norwegian book clubs, The Redbreast deserves its reputation. It's a slow starter. For the first 50 or so pages I nearly gave up - the story jumps back and forth over 70 years, from World War II to the present. Then I remembered that I had the same kind of trouble with some of John Le Carre's books. I had to start reading The Honorable Schoolboy 3 times before it began to make sense to me. But oh, how richly rewarding the effort was! I feel the same about Redbreast. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I think we must give a lot of credit to the translator. The language is smooth, never awkward, the detail is stunning, the dialog is natural. The reason I couldn't give it five stars is that the jumping back and forth in time is still distracting to me, but I can't think of any other way the story could be told.
B0032JTV6U|4.0|The product was exactly as expected. It was brand new and didn't have any signs of wear from shipping.  I am satisfied with the product!
B00328R21C|5.0|The Star Wars sets are my sons favorite, but really all Legos are great. He got this one about a month ago and immediately put it together. He has played with Luke's Landspeeder more than any other set recently. I do agree the Obi Wan and Luke don't look quite right, but my son doesn't care.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great to see Amazon coming to the game with free apps to boot. Game is a blast. I love the improved graphics and no ads. Plays great on Thunderbolt.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|It was too tedious to make money the old-fashioned way, by earning it, so banks-investment firms-insurers started making it the easy way, by fraud, ponzi schemes, and pump and dump scams.  INSIDE JOB exposes the outright crooks that should be jailed and the unregulated financial system that perpetrated and is still free to perpetrate outright fraud.  Investment banks collected huge commissions and interest payments, sold worthless notes down-the-line, and then actually BETTED AGAINST the investments that had just advised their clients to make.  They went bankrupt, but they didn't care, they already had walked away with the billions they robbed, which they still keep.  They made money first on the scam, then by betting on (thru insurance and other non-sense derivatives) the failure of the loans they issued, AND THE GOVERNMENT THEN PAID THEM THRU A BAILOUT.  How many trillion dollars has this cost the U.S. taxpayers thru increased national debt, financial crisis, unemployment, foreclosures, etc?  Not to mention international repercussions.  The Europeans have enacted reform because they can actually think, analyze, and debate issues.  We have a bunch of former Goldman Sachs employees running our government, it's a joke and completely unacceptable!  We let the richest 1% siphon off the money and then the rest of us pay the bill.  BANK THRU CREDIT UNIONS AND DON'T INVEST YOUR MUTUAL FUND MONEY WITH ANY OF THESE ARROGANT CRIMINALS.  They are not geniuses, they are crooks lining each others pocket.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out a good loan.  They are all huge human failures and criminals.     Outstanding movie, thank god it won the academy award. Should be in every library in the country.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great new addition to the angry birds series! Works great and runs even better than the old one for me on my mytouch 4g! Graphics seem better too!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was a big fan of angry birds to begin with but then they updated it and it failed to work on my device. Fortunately angry birds rio doesnt seem to have that problem. great game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great graphics, love the new game. Plays smoothly on droid x. Looking forward to the new levels this year. And for free, can't ask for more
0670022411|5.0|Love, love, love this book. Smart, elegant, evocative writing. Intelligent and completely colorful, well-developed characters. Fantastic story with great history threaded through it. I finished it and started reading again immediately. Can't wait for book II!
B004KA9MQO|2.0|Hudson's self-titled debut album earned the powerhouse singer her first Grammy, but, unfortunately, the album was pedestrian and dull. Hudson's sophomore album is slightly better, but her label continues to weigh her down with generic material. \\"Where You At,\\" the album's first single, is a ballad that's sappy and dated. Sadly, the album is littered with these kind of trite ballads including forgettable album cuts such as \\"Why Is It So Hard,\\" \\"Still Here\\" and the title track. Following the tragic 2008 murders of her family members, it's completely understandable why Hudson aims to record uplifting material. However, it's a shame that Hudson's beautiful voice is once again wasted on disposable material.<br /><br />With that said, everything isn't a disappointment here. Hudson's vocals on her cover of Nina Simone's \\"Feeling Good\\" are great. Album closer \\"Believe\\" contains some of Hudson's best vocal work as well. In addition, Hudson soars on upbeat disco numbers like \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Everybody Needs Love.\\" The songwriting on \\"Angel\\" is cliched, but Hudson's powerhouse vocals soar over the strong melody and marching band production.<br /><br />Hudson is definitely one of this generation's finest singers, but let's hope she starts to record material that's on par with her talent. One more lousy album like this one and audiences could turn on her. Hudson desperately needs some fresh material that makes her stand out, but, sadly, this album isn't it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like the new design and tweaked gameplay. The bird cages are harder to crash than the o.g. pigs.  I love the freeness, good looking out Amazon.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I really like the upgraded look and feel.  I'm not a big fan of the monkeys, but I am still having a lot of fun. Not sure why people couldn't install the app. Worked great on Xperia X10 (Eclair, Rooted, Debranded AT&amp;T).
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Depth and feel of graphics is worth the play alone. Gameplay is finally &quot;fun&quot; again. Thanks again. Free also isn't bad, if I say so myself.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So glad there is more to this game! Its easier to play and I love the set up of it. Almost seems like ot is an actual 3D game. Graphics are great. My whole family loves it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i dont know whats with the low rateings, it rocks like the other angry birds game! i need to fill the 25 word minimum. la
B004R0WKNE|5.0|A great film. You'll feel better having watched it. The cast and the story are beliveable, delivering a full amount of cute, tasteful, and honest humor that only comes from real chemistry, great acting, and beautiful story telling.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I ordered this toy for my 9 month old girl based on previous positive reviews and I was pleasantly surprised at how much we both enjoyed it.  In just a few days, she learned how to use the mallet to beat on the drum.    Construction of the drum is very solid.  It is well made and I like the story behind Plan Toys.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a child over 9 months, even though the age suggestion is 19 months.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|can not get it to install.. can not get other angry birds and angry birds seasons to update... really fed up with the birds 2 days now and they have not fixeed it
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I'll admit that this was my first Tarantino film, so I have no basis of comparison.  I'll also admit to being a huge Brad Pitt fan, and initially I was disappointed that Brad's screen time is less in this movie than I would have expected.    That said, I think the movie was BRILLIANT.   The initial scene between Landa and the French farmer hiding Jews under the floorboards is tense and almost unbearably poignant.   The acting is superb all the way across the board - no weak links.  The \\"basterds\\" and their phony Italian accents at the film premiere scene are hysterically funny.  As for the story itself....all I can say is that Hitler and his band of sadists SHOULD have come to such an end.      I got the film from Netflix, but will definitely be buying a copy and adding it to my collection.  Worth seeing again - and again!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Looks way better the the first angry birds. I have this installed in my VZW Galaxy Tab. It runs perfect! All you ATT users need toclearn how to root! Amazon app store is the best idea yet
B004SBX112|1.0|why would pay 99 cents for this app when its free in the real android market?  come on Amazon seriously?  why have an appstore that charges for free apps?
B003AYBC6E|5.0|Beautiful and astonishing start by one of the best American songwriters and performers of the last 30 years. Must, must have it! Beautiful 180 gram vinyl reissue of the original record with original cover, labels and sleeve (including lyrics!), but protected separate in a plastic audiophile sleeve.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|If you love the original Angry Birds than you will love Angry Birds Rio. I would give it 5 stars if it had more levels......at least they will download later. Love Angry Birds. HTC Evo
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a good and new angry birds. an get birds angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds a a a a a a
B002ZG98UA|5.0|This was a great addition to the Resident Evil movies!  The movie is fast paced, and full of twists and turns throughout.  My only flaw with this movie, was that it was made for 3D [mind you, when I saw in 3D in theatres it was awesome!!], but when watching it in 2D at home it has many parts that are just for 3D and emphasize way too much on stuff flying at the screen.  It is a great movie and must see for everyone who loves a good action film.  Also, when the credits start, wait for a second because it will toss in an additional clip of the movie -- FYI.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I bought this headset for my husband last Christmas. I spent around $70 on the headset and also bought him the Ear Force DSS surround sound processor for $75 to go with the headset. All in all I spent a good $140-150 total. So imagine how angry I was when all of the sudden the plastic piece that holds one of the earphones in place snaps after 3 months of use. So the earphone was just dangling from a wire. We have always been very careful when handling and caring for this headset. My husband has super glued the headset back together but we can tell it won't last long. Soon we will probably be taping it with electrical tape. Wow...how classy.<br />I do have to say that if this headset wasn't so cheaply made it would be totally worth the money. I play video games as well and you just can't beat the experience when you are playing Call of Duty or any similar game with this headset. Adding the Ear Force DSS to give you surround sound makes it just that much for awesome.<br />So I'd truly love to give this headset a 5 star rating but obviously I can't due to the fact that they aren't made to last even a few months, let alone a whole year.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Game is just OK, only 60 levels and 30 more evry 2-3 months. I already got 3 star and all other bonus stuff in less then 24 hours. When an angry bird release comes out it needs to have 500+ levels or at least a level builder. Now must wait for any of the 3 angry bird apps to recieve an update, game is fun but easy.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Ms. Hudson is back and as good or better than ever.  So glad to have a new album by this songbird!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thank you amazon for the free app.  The app store store should make google embarrassed about their market.  The daily free leader app is a proven winner!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Game is fine from what I have played and just wanted to state that the download was simple and works on my Droid X.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The original Angry Birds is such a fun game, that this one had a lot to live up to. It won my vote! It is so much fun &amp; the graphics are fantastic. Definitely 5 stars!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is my first I phone game. WOW the graphics are great and the game is tons of fun.  It works well on my LG Vortex.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|rovio somehow made a game better than the last. love it!  can't wait to see the new levels coming out each few months. when is the next one?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Make sure your phone can install such apps!    If you want to enjoy a true Android experience, check out the [[ASIN:B004GPGDFQ Google Nexus S Cell Phone Black Factory Unlocked]]. It has all the freedom of a phone that you need to enjoy all kinds of games and apps. Stop supporting carrier restrictions on how you use your phone. You bought it, you should be able to use it as you wish!    With that said; I love this series of games. If you do as well, then this will be a new chapter of entertainment. The graphics are amazing and colors are wonderful. I wish I had a larger screen to enjoy all that android has to offer. Makes me want to visit Brazil now... Amazon Tourism?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I don't know why, I just never really enjoyed it. I was hoping this one would be a bit different. I tried it out & got bored just as easily. My sister & daughter both really love the game though, so that's why it's a 5 star :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great addition and better graphics and music. reading alot of complaints but works great on my evo shift, my wifes evo, my sons incredible and my daughters droid 2.
1401309666|4.0|Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of \\"Wired\\" magazine wrote The Long Tail after posting many articles and blogs regarding this theory.  The Long Tail that Anderson speaks of expands upon the tail end of an economics curve that never seems to end.  He has done research that shows the amount of sales in the niche and obscure market is what really keeps businesses alive.   Many of his examples are related to the entertainment industry: books, television, movies and music.  These types of products support the Long Tail theory.  He dives really deep into each subset of the entertainment industry and all of their marketing providers.  The rise of I-Tunes has had an enormous impact on the music industry and the number of \\"records\\" the number one hit sells.  He notes that there will always be \\"hits\\" but the Internet has truly taken over the providers of books, DVDs, music, and much more.     Anderson brings up the Pareto Rule or 80/20 rule, on more than one occasion.  One example of how to explain the Pareto Rule is that 80% of sales come from 20% of the products.   His theory is that the Pareto rule no longer exists.   This is because sales still occur in many different products.  Some may not be as much as 80%, but they are still contributing to the sales. He has some statistics to support this theory, but I still believe that it is a solid rule to follow when small businesses are doing strategic planning.   With the number of choices we have today, consumers expect to be provided an unlimited number of choices when making a purchase.  That is why people shop at Amazon.com rather than going to a neighborhood bookstore.  Really, at Amazon.com, the choices are almost endless.    At the conclusion, Anderson even gives tips of how to create a \\"Long Tail business.\\" His main two tips are: \\"1. Make Everything Available, and 2. Help me find it.\\" (pg 217) Anderson makes it appear as though if you don't have a long tail business, then you may not survive.  I agree with that in some sense.  As time goes on, the internet is going to be the main source for shopping and the sites with the most choices and easiest navigation will be the survivors.   I found this book to be extremely interesting from both a marketing and economics perspective.  The research, data presented and analysis performed was supporting of all Anderson's thoughts and theories.  However, I did find it to be quite repetitive and the points could have been made in half the length.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I enjoyed the original and this one was no different. All of the Angry Birds games are addictive, challenging, and fun. I really like the tropical theme. I really don't understand the negative reviews on here. How could a free and awesome app be bad?
B004LP601S|4.0|First order of business... get your hands on the 5 bonus tracks that come with different deluxe versions of the album (Oh Glory, Stall Me, I Wanna Be Free, Turn Off the Lights, and Bittersweet). Add those to the Vices and Virtues original 10 to greatly enhance the enjoyability of this record. The bonus tracks are just as good if not better than some of the standard releases.        As for the album in general, I say its much better than Pretty Odd but not as good as their first. I rated A Fever You Can't Sweat Out with five stars so I feel four on this album is fair. I thought Pretty Odd was alright and I know Ryan is a great lyricist but I find it relieving not to have to listen to his boring voice on this album. Pretty Odd was such a departure from AFYCSO that I think of it as though it was created by a completely different band.        When comparing V&V to their first album, I notice that a lot of the uptempo beats and clever incorporation of a wide range of instruments and synth has returned. This is definitely a positive for me as it was one of reasons I found AFYCSO so catchy and original. The one thing I believe this album is really missing is more of the dark, haunting sound of classic PATD created by the use of minor chords, overly mature lyrics, and exaggerated tone of Brendon's vocals. A few of the songs on V&V are almost too happy, poppy, or even cheesy at times.       A great example of what I'm talking about can be heard in their current single \\"Ballad of Mona Lisa.\\" The song starts off with eerie broken chords and dark vocals that put the listener on edge. This is followed by a bright pre-chorus and finally a beautiful transition to the main chorus bringing great resolution to the edginess of the verses. Had there been a bit more of that throughout the album, I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. All in all, Vices & Virtues is worth the purchase to any long time Panic fan.
B00457X7XQ|3.0|I give the book three solid stars. I would recommend it as an excellent educational read on many levels, but caution about its linear plot.     Two months ago, the \\"Fatal System Error\\" by Joseph Menn, got me hooked on this cybercrime world. This non-fiction book reads like a thriller. Next was the recent \\"Counting from Zero\\" by Alan Johnston. It is a fast-paced fiction tale about a group of friends - eccentric global travelers - trying to save the world from yet another \\"zero day\\".     \\"Zero Day\\" was a natural next step. The security forensics descriptions were truly fascinating despite the tediousness of the process. It was helpful to get a perspective on the relationships among numerous US agencies involved. I enjoyed the crossing of the mountains part very much. (A hint for the next book.) As a whole, the plot was straightforward until the last few chapters that added thrilling dynamics to the book. I wished, I could have connected with the characters on a more personal level, but they were too dead serious to me.     Hope that you find this review helpful.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game looks much better. New elements to enjoy. No ads to get on the way, and despite the better graphics, theres less lag on my lg optimus (whereas before there was some on the more intense levels). All in all a much better and more polished game.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging yet mind-numbing at the same time. I enjoy the seasonal levels and themes. Totally worth paying for ad-free. I have all 3 versions and play when I get a free moment or just to kill time.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|So far a little easier than the original. My kids will like this one more if I ever give them the opportunity. I like that it automatically moves you forward.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging yet mind-numbing at the same time. Totally worth getting. The slightly different premise is fun. I have all 3 versions and play when I get a free moment or just to kill time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the free game from amazon! Just as good as the originals plus a new take from the movie.... keep offering up the free games
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging yet mind-numbing at the same time. Totally worth paying for ad-free. I have all 3 versions and play when I get a free moment or just to kill time.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|\\"The Tourist\\" was made with the best of intentions, there is no denying that. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's ode to Alfred Hitchcock's [[ASIN:B001PKHS68 To Catch a Thief (The Centennial Collection)]] is breezy, charming entertainment. The story here may seem pat on the surface, and upon it's initial viewing the ending may come out of left field for some. But be sure to pay attention because everything does add up. By design you will not be able to fully appreciate Elise (Angelina Jolie) and Frank's (Johnny Depp) romantic relationship, which is a major part of the film, the first go around. It's in that narrative hurdle that many will be turned off by the film or worse, dismiss it all together once it ends, but like I said, a second viewing will certainly clear things up and even make it much more enjoyable. The chemistry between Jolie and Depp is, much like the film, light as a feather. This is something that can also be counted as a detractor but I thought it worked quite well. Films of this style need a breezy air about them and Jolie and Depp easily bring that to the table. In the end \\"The Tourist\\" is misunderstood and underrated. I think many contemporary film goers just aren't familiar with 1950s European romantic mysteries like \\"To Catch a Thief\\" making it nearly impossible for them to properly gage \\"The Tourist.\\" If you are aware of this style \\"The Tourist\\" will be a light, fun diversion. It's nothing special but it's certainly nice to see that they tried.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|the graphics and sound are top notch. there is a departure from classic Birds as you are freeing captured birds but this is one fine game nonetheless.
B002F6FQGK|4.0|How do I describe this new sound to my ears? The title of my review comes close.   I love playing this album; it's so creative. Florence has so much energy and you can't help but feel caught up in it. She is an artist you can believe. Her songs are powerful tracks and I am loving them all intently with the exception of Kiss With a Fist. This is a great addition to the art I hang in my ears!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This game plays so smooth on the HTC Thunderbolt!! The graphics look better on my phone than my iTouch! Glad I got the game free!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this app works great! it is a very nicely designed version of angry birds. if it doesn't work on your phone, you did something wrong. took me a while to figure this out but totally worth it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my Droid X with an Apex custom ROM. Nicely updated graphics, sound, and gameplay. Great sequel to the original. Even better I got it for free. :)
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I never buy apps, especially games. I started playing the free version and played it almost non-stop for a month. So I caved in and bought the elite version. It adds alot to the game. Many new faction worlds and contracts that earn a lot more money. I am very pleased with my purchase and if you like turn based RPG games you won't be disappointed.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Magnific is the word. This movie is just plain MEGA magnificent.  Megamind and yes that `beautiful fish you' are addictive - so careful, you watch it once and you will watch again.  All the characters are wonderful and the voices used were true to form.  They gave real life to the characters.  The animation is superb.  Watch it alone.  Then watch with a friend, only watch it!!!  Saying too much will spoil some of it for you, so enough said.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|nice. music is great. easy to play. graphics look good. so many options and levels. this is one of the best games and I'm glad it saves to SD card. :)
B002ZG999U|5.0|O...M...G...Almost every action hero from the '80s and '90s together in one movie...and the scene on the pier...I nearly plotzed!  A dream come true?  A pure fantasy?  A reason to live?  YES!  Out of five stars I give this eleventy billion and 12 for sheer awesomeness and at least 5985 for coolness and definitely 329 for the movie itself.  Sylvester Stallone...Arnold Schwarzenegger...Bruce Willis all in ONE SCENE together...somebody please help me up off the floor!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it's pretty cool. love the new interface. like the back grounds and the fact that you free birds instead of defeating pigs. :) :) :) :) :) :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've always disliked hurting the poor, innocent pigs in the original. In this incarnation of Angry Birds you use your surprisingly hardy projectiles to free caged birds. The wrongly accused green piggies are thankfully absent and therefore safe from the feathered menace.<br /><br />Oh yea, review: the game is great. Amazon deserves huge kudos for getting it to android. :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I don't understand all the people having issues with login and purchases. Don't rate something down because you can't do what the easy to understand instructions aay. Installed fine and looks better than the seasons version keep the good work Rovio.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great app does exactly what I need it to. Very similar to the note app on the IPhone and works just as well. Would recommend to anybody.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|sucks, as its available in us only. so, pirating probably is the best option for 90 percent of your customers. what a shame. hope you are happy with that.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is a great way to toss away a lot of your spare time.  Even our 3yr old gets a kick out of launching birds and the resulting destruction.
0316098337|5.0|A book depicting the worldview of a five-year-old, covering experiences far outside what most people experience, yet always ringing true. Though this is a page-turner, at times I had anxiety about continuing to read this book as I was so emotionally invested in the lives of the main characters.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Pretty cool game with some tricky puzzles, but it took me about 45 minutes to complete. I was shocked at the abrupt ending. Not worth the $2.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George, George, George........    I want the originals - not your cartoons.    These films looked GOOD because they looked REAL - now they look like S^&*    Stop tinkering and release the originals - clean them up, restore them, but don't ALTER them for god's sake.    Till' then, I'm going to enjoy my laserdiscs :)    CIAO!
B000GGOCIE|5.0|I have read this book twice and have never gotten bored with the characters. I have always loved the Arthurian tales as I love the knights, wizards, maidens  and chivalry world and feel extremely drawn to this realm. The Middle Ages have spoken to me all through my life.  If ever I had prior lives, I lived my favorite during this time period.<br /><br />The fact that the women are the strong leaders and story-tellers in this version of the legends of Arthur, only adds to the intrigue. Morgaine was the dark beauty and Priestess of Avalon and this fact alone brought depth to the whole storyline. She as the Pagan and Gwenhwyfar as the fair-haired Christian, leave Arthur at odds with sister/wife as well as Pagan/Christian, which ends up being his ruin. The reader saw the Pagan religion compared to Christianity leaving the reader to chose which they felt best described how Arthur's personality/character evolved into the man who was and will be again.<br /><br />The book also points to Arthur and Lancelot's relationship in a whole different light - and puts Gwyn, Arthur and Lancelot in bed together in a m&eacute;nage trois that was meant to produce an heir to the throne but only left the participants even more confused about their perception of their relationship with one another.<br /><br />Arthur could never balance the two women he loved the most, the feelings he harbored for his best friend, nor the religions they each represented.  I feel if he could have come to some sort of mutual understanding of both, he could have been so much more than he was. The story presented the religion of nature, and the respect thereof, to the forefront and how we can live with both Christ and Nature to create a better society in which to live. If only Arthur could have blended the two.<br /><br />The movie however, was not to my liking and did not do the book justice.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I have this app on all my android devices along with RepliGo. For under a buck this is as good as it gets. Does the job and very well too.
B004RF2KAC|5.0|For me this album is more focused than her debut--with better material that seems more personal and directed--she even wrote the title song.  I love this album, and her voice is so unique, in that she is not trying to sound like any of the single named hot chicks out there--like it seems every other girl does these days.  Jennifer Hudson is a true individual, and I Remember Me, if anything hearkens back to the glory days of Whitney--original, fresh and powerful.  Nice job Ms. Hudson!
B00475AYJQ|2.0|Here's my short review:  Book 1 was awesome.  However, Wise Man's Fear was plodding, full of random incidents, and characters who make zero progress by the end.  Read the Cliffs Notes version just before Book 3 comes out.    Edit:  The only reason I wrote this review is to lower the star rating for the book to reflect its mediocrity.
B001R0XNSI|1.0|Now that i've owned and carried this a few months I can say that the build quality of this is crap. Marker sucks. It's great if you carefully grip it and stab downward like it says to. but I dropped it off my desk. only a couple feet! and the thin flimsy threads that hold the cap on broke in half, So its great if you want to baby it and pretend that its a defensive \\"marker\\" just don't drop it or its gone.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it was really generous of Amazon to offer this app for free! I already beat both levels. the boss fight is a welcome addition in my book! can't wait for the first update coming in may!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The graphics are nicer on Rio than previous AB games. Not huge differences but little things such as the Star effects at the end of each level. I also like how they changed it up a bit by changing eggs to pineapples and not using the Pigs in this one.<br /><br />Love it!
B004GYY714|5.0|Awesome radio app.  Has all but one of the stations I listen to regularly, but that's not their fault... it's restricted by the broadcaster.  Delay is negligible, quality varies depending on the station.  Will be used heavily.  It's like satellite radio on your phone!  Kudos to the developers!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|On the first level,  as soon as the box pops up with instructions to flick the bird it force closes.  Might be my ROM but doubt it as all other games,  including orig.  Angry Birds works flawlessly.  HTC Incredible running OMFGB gingerbread ROM (Android 2.3.2)  and Overclocked to 1.15ghz.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is like a nice upgrade to the other 2 Angry Birds...this is the best out of all of them so far!!! Definitely worth getting.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed on the Droid Incredible just fine! A great game with some nice additions from the previous versions. I like the &quot;boss&quot; at the end
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Might be nice IT THE DAMNED THING ACTUALLY DOWNLOADED! Followed the directions to the letter. Tried 4X. Still nothing.<br /><br />Try again, Amazon, if you want people to use your service. So far? Not so good.<br /><br />Not interested in lame excuses or the like. Simply do it.<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />Seems the program doesn't like it if the SD card is filled with trash. Deleting the SD card's garbage and getting a larger one enabled the Amazon marketplace to work. Google's didn't have this issue. Amazon's customer support was not particularly helpful. Found the solution only after much internet research.<br /><br />UPDATE: Deleting the SD card's trash & freeing space worked. The game isn't as good as the original one, but fun nonetheless.
1439102724|4.0|I loved this book. Like all of Ms. Picoult's novels, each chapter is told from a different character's perspective and deals with a contemporary debatable issue. In this case, the issue is the morality of gay marriage and gays raising children, along with who has right to take possession of frozen embryos in the event of divorce. I loved the ending, which was how it should be! (i don't want to spoil it for anyone.)  I could see this one being a movie, much the way Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" was made into a movie a few years ago.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I sensed the ending long before the last page, but I still thoroughly enjoyed every page of this fast paced, though provoking novel.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not sure what the problems are for others, but this installed and ran no problem on Droid X/ Verizon.<br />So far, great game play and graphics. If you enjoyed the original and Seasons, then you're sure to love this. If you get addicted to playing games easily- stay away from Angry Birds! Free from Amazon just makes it that much sweeter.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Typical birds, addictive! No ads good stuff! A very good edition to the series. Once you start...you can not stop launching birds into stuff! I highly recommend this game, especially for the low low price of free!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|So far,  app makes it through the opening screens,  but bombs on the first level after clicking the check box to start the level.<br /><br />I'm sure a future update will resolve this.
B004J713JW|4.0|Billy Joel performed on my college student union patio back in 1974 and got so ticked off at the spotlight operator not following his antics around stage that he jumped on the top of his piano and stood there until the spotlight finally settled on him and tossed two large, glowing birds into the air and screamed, \\"F--- You!\\"<br /><br />Billy Joel begins this fantastic closing performance at Shea Stadium in 2008 before it was torn down by ripping through his early anthem, \\"Angry Young Man.\\" It's nice to know some things haven't changed. Oh, sure, he's now bald, grey, paunchy, and sweating buckets of water onto his keyboard on a hot summer night before a standing room only crowd of about 110,000. But the voice is still amazingly strong and supple, and the songs he goes through in this two and a half hour tour de force are the deep album cuts most long-term Billy Joel fans want to hear; from \\"Miami 2017,\\" to \\"Captain Jack,\\" to \\"Goodnight, Saigon,\\" to \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.\\"<br /><br />Guest stars like Garth Brooks, (\\"Shameless\\"), Tony Bennett (\\"New York State of Mind\\"), John Mayer (\\"This is the Time\\"), and Paul McCartney (\\"Let It Be\\") show up to augment the festivities. But trust me on this one ... Billy Joel snarling and playing his piano and reminding you to \\"Not take sh-- from anyone\\" is plenty enough to stir your blood. It's fun to play `spot the celebrity' on the infield below the stage. Isn't that billionaire New York City mayor Bloomberg beaming widely right in the middle of the huddled, sweating masses? I wish I had been there. Check this out and you'll wish you had been, also.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is great. It has beautiful graphics and I have had no problems with it so far. Best of all, there are no annoying ads. I just wish I could log out of the amazon app store....
B004ISVH7U|5.0|If you were alive and aware in 1969, you know it was anything but a time of confidences. I remember being 15 and getting tear-gassed at the Washington Monument in the middle of an angry war protest on the Fourth of July among 250,000 people ... and I was just there to see Bob Hope and the Beach Boys. Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were assassinated the year before. Cities burned down during the riots afterward. The daily news was a parade of body count numbers from Vietnam. The country was torn between Nixon supporters, anti-war protestors, hippies, Black Panther radicals, John Birch conservatives, poverty, racism, and migrant and other abused workers struggling for decent working conditions through collective bargaining (oops, bye bye). But in total counterpoint to the chaos came a sound as pure and serene and ... confident as humanly possible. Two friends who had been singing together since they were 11 year-old pups were just now hitting their peak with \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water;\\" an album that captured lyrical, vocal and engineering mastery beyond measure.<br /><br />There is no fill on the album. Nothing mediocre. It launches you into the stratosphere on the opening title cut and never lets up. It's one sustained mood of mixed emotions brilliantly recorded after another. No mere \\"Greatest Hits\\" album by the same duo could ever match the level of sustained inspiration woven here. Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel knew it. They split up after this. How could it ever by topped? Well, there are still some surprises left for us in the seen-and-heard-it-all 2011, and this 40th anniversary edition comes not only with a remastered version of the album, but a Simon and Garfunkel CBS television special that originally aired in 1969, PLUS a new documentary interviewing the key players on the making the of the album. And every moment is revelation.<br /><br />Simon and Garfunkel had four of the top five chart positions at the time and were so popular that a one-hour network special on CBS gave them carte blanche to do whatever they wanted. So they did a wandering meditative tone poem of moving images on America featuring John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy's funeral train while \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" played over. That featured young couples in love contrasted with violent and fiery war images from Vietnam while \\"Scarborough Faire\\" played. That featured widow Coretta King talking about poverty over disturbing images of diseased and starving children. And they ended (big sigh of relief from the network), with a brief on stage concert. Naturally, millions of shocked viewers choked on their nightcap cocktails and tumbled out of their easy chairs to switch the channel over to the Peggy Fleming Ice Skating special on ABC. When director Charles Grodin (yes, THAT Charles Grodin), screened the Coretta King voiceover poverty section to the network brass, they asked him if he could adjust the audio on it. \\"How do you want it?\\" he asked. \\"Inaudible,\\" they replied.<br /><br />The original sponsor dropped out, but Alberto VO5 stepped in (hey, there was a lot of hair on young viewers in 1969), and the show aired as produced. Try watching it in the context of 1969, or even prime time network television TODAY, and you will gasp at what they got away with. And if you can watch Robert Kennedy's funeral train pass through the countryside by waving mourners as \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" reaches its crescendo, and without crying, you need to check the dose level of your anti-depressants. You just might be catatonic.<br /><br />Take a deep breath after the television special, thinking you've struck unearthed gold never seen since 1969, but here comes a fantastic new documentary about the making of the album (and the special), and nirvana kicks in. If you care about music at all, or how it is created or inspired, or recorded, you will be entranced. Paul Simon reveals the gospel music he was listening to when the inspiration struck for \\"Bridge,\\" which he readily acknowledges is beyond any rational explanation. Art Garfunkel convinces him to add the third verse taking it even higher. Their genius engineer, Roy Halee, master of finding the perfect echo, records the \\"li li li\\" chorus of \\"The Boxer\\" in a stone church chapel to get the right haunting tones. He records the drum crescendos for \\"Bridge\\" outside the elevators at CBS to the shock and awe of departing passengers. Garfunkel and Simon playfully slap their hands on their denim-covered knees in a hotel room, roll the Sony recorder, create a one-minute loop, and inadvertently come up with the entire rhythm backing for \\"Cecilia.\\" And on and on.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I always get thrills from hearing artists describe their moments of inspiration. That's my crack addiction. The joy of invention, of innovation, of seeking that perfect sound infuses everything they did or discuss here. And you share that joy of discovery with them. Unless of course, your lithium dosage won't let you.<br /><br />Troubled outer times call for a stillness of inner peace. Simon and Garfunkel somehow sensed that delicate balance in 1969 and distilled a sound for the ages with this masterpiece. Witness the creation of that same masterpiece 40 years later to understand how the silences within these sounds are needed more than ever.dily acknowledges is beyond any rational explanation.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|The rich have no shame. There's no other conclusion. It's staring you in the face for the full two hours of this Academy Award-winning documentary. We all know the basic story of how 30 years of deregulation let the wolves run away with the hen house in Wall Street banking. The bankers got greedy and became investors, gambling on artificially-created derivatives, and when they lost their shirts, we all paid the bill. It's even more shocking to see how the rating agencies such as Moody's or Standard & Poors pimped out their triple AAA ratings on these crap CDOs to help legitimize these gambles. Or how leading academics at the financial colleges also help perpetuate future generations of \\"greed is good\\" graduates because they're on the take as well, accepting huge consulting fees from the same few banks that essentially control the world's economy and give our president's their marching orders. \\"You WILL bail us out for our greed-infested gambling with taxpayer money, or we'll take the whole ballgame down with us,\\" they threatened. And so it was.<br /><br />But the one thing I keep coming away with is, \\"Who ARE these human beings?\\" Are they EVEN human beings? Did they ever possess any kind of conscience or shame? And the answer obviously appears, \\"No.\\" Maybe it's some genetic disposition, or brain anomaly that allows the scheming rich to make the decisions they make that take no other human consequence into consideration. There's just no other explanation. The rich don't make those kinds of conscious or ethical calculations. They just make the cash calculations. And if ever you needed proof, this documentary not only puts those moral-free actions on display, but even features some of the shameless demons being interviewed on camera for all to see. Because the other thing they lack besides any shame or empathy, is any governor (or regulator) on their gall or ego. \\"60 Minutes\\" made its bread and butter for 30 years on the fact the rich and powerful often think they can get camera time and still come off like the brilliant people they think they are, without ever understanding that the only thing they ultimately reveal ... is their complete lack of empathy or shame. Or guilt. It's not in their DNA. Oh, some of them are married to actual human beings - women that talk them into donating to universities or hospital medical wings (featuring their names and portraits), but that's just to stop the nagging. It wasn't because they were exercising any recognizable form of conscience.<br /><br />Let's be clear; we're not talking about those who became rich as a by-product of their creative, scientific or innovative achievements in pursuit of what they would have been doing even if money weren't involved. We're not talking about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Oprah or even Charlie Sheen. We're talking about those who pursued money for the sake of money, and whose only creativity is to scheme for more. Those who worship at the house of money.<br /><br />Oh, sure, I'm generalizing, and being judgmental and pig-headed. But watch this movie and see if you don't feel the same way afterwards. If every working class American saw this film, there would be a revolution, complete with guillotines and beheadings. But the head of some of these pigs separated from their bodies, staring back at themselves, still wouldn't get what they did wrong. Isn't getting rich the American Dream? Doesn't the end justify the means? Maybe it's time we found a more worthwhile dream.ra time and still come off like the brilliant people they think they are, without ever understanding that the only thing they ultimately reveal ... is their complete lack of empathy or shame.

0670022411|3.0|The thought that kept popping into my head while reading this story was - I wonder if there is a bunch of grad students doing papers on how vampires have become the stand-in for the dominant male that populated romance novels of times past. (And for 2/3 of the book this is a romance, just as much as Twilight). And the vampire, Matthew, in this book is VERY dominant. He tells his witch, Diana, when to eat, when to sleep, & where to go. I think the only part of her life he did not control was what she wore. There are major plans made in the last few chapters of the book that he doesn't divulge to her until the last second. She is told by Matthew's mother she must obey his every command. And Diana, an Oxford scholar & Yale tenured professor does not seem to question it at all. I think we are supposed to believe it is true love or fate that causes her to follow him so completely. Also perhaps her brief research & superficial understanding on wolves & their behavior, which in Harkness' lore vampires share many common traits with. It seems an interesting phenomenon that vampires have filled this dominance vacuum created by the sensitive modern male. Maybe women desire this type of man or maybe they just want to read about one.    But besides that it was an enjoyable book & I think that the next book will be better. This book is the first & was the foundation that the rest of the books will establish itself on so any dragging that occurs part way through the book I think needs to be forgiven, as the reader is filled in on background & is shown how very much Matthew loves Diana. I will be reading the next book hoping it is a little more action packed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thank you for the new levels, and we're looking forward to the next level packs in the upcoming months. The monkeys in particular are worthy new opponents.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I would purchase again from the same seller and yes the film was well received.    Thank You-
B004SBS8LA|5.0|best angry birds yet, I normally get a bit dull eyed playing angry birds for to long. but this edition is great on your eyes and its got depth. almost as good as live angry birds on CONAN.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This is a great concept and all except for a tiny detail in that the entire world outside the united states has been left out of the Amazon Appstore. There are literally tons of people waiting to buy properly curated apps and it is especially unfair that we are missing out on this opportunity to get this app for free on the opening day!     Guess all my excitement about the appstore opening was in vain...
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I loved 19 and was excited but nervous about 21.  I have to say that it is even better than 19.  Her voice is just as amazing.  The songs are just as evocative but I find myself wanting to blast the music and groove as well!  I love this CD!
B004GYY714|5.0|This program is incredibly easy to use, and allows you to listen to local, national, and even international radio stations through this program. You can look up stations either by location or by genre, but you can easily create a list of bookmarks of favorite stations instead of having to browse each time.<br /><br />The audio quality is superb, and there is almost no loading/buffering time. It hasn't once dropped the station once playback began, which I can't say about some of the other programs I've tried.<br /><br />Some might be wondering whether this is necessary if they have Pandora installed on their phones. This is! Pandora is great for discovering new music, but this streams not only music stations, but talk radio, too. Similarly, if your phone came pre-installed with a radio chip, this is still a great app because it allows you to listen to many radio stations around the world.<br /><br />This program is really a pleasure to use: its user interface is very intuitive, its audio quality is very impressive, and there is a wide range of radio stations available. I am running this on a Droid 2 Global running Froyo and have never had any problems with the program freezing or crashing. I strongly recommend this!
0743454537|4.0|I heard about this book for years and heard about how great it was. When I finally read it I was worried that it wouldnt live up to all the great things I had heard about it but it didn't; it was a really good book.
B004NELBPC|4.0|The Huffington Post is considered by many to be very left-of-center, but even though I self-identify as a political moderate, I like the Huffington Post's comprehensive news coverage. I generally check the website rarely (rather, I frequently come across articles through Google News), but with this app I appreciate just how extensive their selection of articles is.<br /><br />The app is very polished and I highly recommend it to anyone who follows the news. The widget is also quite good, but as another reviewer noted, it is not as customizable as some other programs' widgets are.<br /><br />I am running this on a [[ASIN:B004E9TLVM Motorola DROID 2 Global Android Phone, Sapphire (Verizon Wireless)]] and have had no problems so far with the program or the widget crashing or freezing. I will update this review if I do experience problems.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|The idea of this invisible shield is great, but I would have it professionally applied.<br />There's almost no way to put it on the phone correctly without getting it all fingerprinted and bubbled.<br />I wouldn't suggest purchasing this product.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't own a Kindle, but have been using the Kindle app to read e-books on my cell phone ever since the program was released and absolutely love it. I have since also installed it on my rooted B&N Nook Color, and enjoy it even more.<br /><br />This is a very convenient way to read since the program offers very stable performance, allows extensive customizations (such as changing font size and screen brightness), and remembers where in the book you last left off. I frequently use this program in the subway, it is great for when you want to relax but you don't have a cell signal to run some other programs.<br /><br />The real benefit of reading through the Kindle app as opposed to some alternatives is that the checkout process is lightning-fast. You can also frequently get free books for Kindle, so not only am I able to read more conveniently, but more cheaply, too!<br /><br />I am currently running it on my Droid 2 Global running Froyo (2.2), and have had no problems. While you can't download onto a tablet or AT&T phone through the Amazon Appstore yet, you can get this through the Android Market on those devices.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|keep up the good work! I enjoy this app. I got all of them. this is all fun. I play it more than any app.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|i really enjoyed this version of angry birds. i like the new theme samba song. the new graphics are excellent. and i got it for free. too bad i have to wait for the new levels :(
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this new version breathes life into a game that in my opinion certainly needed it. the change of music and scenery is great. The lack of advertising is perfect.
0756404738|5.0|Outstanding. Easily one of the best books I have ever read, with one of the most thorough and detailed plots I have ever encountered and extremely well defined characters. Patrick Rothfuss can proudly take his place beside authors such as Tolkien and Robert Jordan as a writer of particular skill and imagination. If this series takes less than three more novel to complete I will be severly dissapointed, the more of this colorful world I get to experience the better. If you are any kind of reader, this book and its prelude, Name of the Wind, are a must.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is a must watch for nature lovers, and in general for everyone. The videography, the subjects and the locales are just too good. The color and sound is really a treat for the viewers. Attenboroughs voice is also a big part of this video.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|As a Prime member this is my goto shopping app. I use it for price checks, wishlists and reviews. And the \\"evil\\" One Click purchase :)  Great product and service. Searching by category or listing can be painful, but imho it's not the main purpose of the app.<br /><br />However, where did the Product search by photo go?
B004SBS8LA|1.0|1.) Took forever to download. (I'm on high speed wifi network, not 3g) no biggy.  2.) won't even go past the \\"ROVIO\\" screen. freezes then force closes.  3.) that ain't cool. i had high hopes now...not so much.    I am deleting both angry birds and the amazon app store.  DE-REGISTERING MY DEVICE
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i have tried at least 10 times. not happy!!! why won't this work? have droid x and Verizon.  is it because of that? please help?
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I just got done watching Avatar for the first time.  After all the hype it had a lot to live up to.  The first hour was not so good.  Things are rushed there are alot of character you don't care about.  A lot of Hollywood Movie cliches in the first hour.  After that the movie picks up but the ending clearly shows that James Cameron backed himself in corner and took the easy way out.  Or didn't want to spend another 15 - 30 minutes having Navi making a better battle plan.  The Marines where one big cliche.  I prefer the Marines in Aliens than Avatar.  Overall a fun flick and if its on when I turn the channel I may leave it on.  But it definately didn't live up to the hype.  Now I will head over to Red Letter Media and see how they reviewed it.  That should be fun.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I love this game.  I've been playing it on my free-with-ads version on my Incredible with no problem.  Downloaded the .99 app here with a huge sigh of relief that there won't be any more ads.  While I was at it, I downloaded the .99-but-free-today RIO as well.<br /><br />This game opens without problem.  But it promptly crashes every time I will the level.<br />The RIO game won't open at all.<br /><br />So, if I uninstall this, I lose all the previous data (all of my 3-star levels!!).  If I don't uninstall, I can't play.  Lose, Lose situation.<br /><br />Recommendation:  check out the Rovio site and Android Central BEFORE you download this version.  There a known problems with the Incredible.<br /><br />Recommendation:  don't give up!  Rovio WILL fix this!!
0439023521|3.0|For the young, not yet exposed to many similarly themed books and movies, this can be engaging fare. It will be interesting to see the rest of the trilogy and whether the victors can come to grips with the cost of victory and the society that sponsors the games.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I won't be visiting the Amazon App Store again, Its a big joke So instead of just going to the market on your phone and downloading something, you have to go to amazon, do 10 steps and then be told you can't get it in uk?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Updated graphics and sounds with all the fun of the original!  Great app and sure to pack plenty of fun when you have a few minutes to spare!
B0018M6J90|4.0|This  is a  fun  movie.   I  would  watch  it  a couple of  times  more.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|I can't recommend this special edition enough. If you already own British Steel (and you should) this new edition is great only because of the DVD. If you don't have this classic album in your collection, what are you waiting for???<br /><br />This editon comes in a double jewelled CD case. The booklet has this new bloody cover. Inside you have the original cover design, plus new pictures of the band (including Mr. Scott Travis, that was not the drummer on the original recording) and a lot of liner notes.<br /><br />The first CD the is same as the remastered edition of British Steel that were released some years ago, including the new previously unrelease tracks. There's nothing different here, only that British Steel is maybe one of the most classic metal albums ever. Tracks like Rapid Fire, Metal Gods, Grinder, Breaking The Law, Living After Midnight, United, are all classic Priest tunes that they keep on playing alive until today.<br /><br />The crown jewel of this package is the live DVD where the current line up (Rob Halford, KK Downing, Glen Tipton, Ian Hill and Scott Travis) plays the whole album plus a bunch of bonus songs. The DVD is fantastic, great sound and great video quality. It's great to see those guys playing alive all those great songs as if they were really fresh. In some ways I think they are.<br /><br />British Steel 30th Anniversary Edition is a great special edition of a classic metal masterpiece. Highly recommended!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great companion to my Kindle. If I accidently leave my Kindle at home (which rarely happens), I can still pick up my current book right where I left off. Also I find the mobile app Kindle store easier to shop on than my actual Kindle. It is like the mobile site. Sometimes I order books using my phone to read on my Kindle.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Beautiful graphics and effects.  Bells and whistles galore.  Tons of polish on an already fun and addicting game.  Ignore the one-star reviews that are being submitted due to a problem with Amazon's store.   This is a 5-star app.

0671646788|5.0|How highly do I think of this book? Put it this way... had I have read this book in the first place, I might have never bothered putting up my practicalgoalachieving blog (well, OK... I might have still put it up ;-))! Seriously... if I had to write a self-help book, this would probably be it.<br /><br />I say \\"probably\\" because there are some \\"minor\\" problems I have with it. So, I guess \\"5 stars\\" is not quite correct. How about \\"4.5 stars\\" or 4.7 stars?<br /><br />But, anyway, about the book: The funny thing is, as I was going through the intro and the first chapter, the material in this book really didn't \\"jump\\" out at me as anything special. It was pretty much about how to think bigger, how to believe in yourself, goals and solid beliefs vs. wishes, etc.... Not bad advice, but being someone who is an avid reader of self-help and personal development books, this was pretty much things I could have read... well... anywhere. Even on some of those over-priced e-books on Clickbank (thank goodness for their 60 day refund policy).<br /><br />Also (and this was one of the very, very few problems I had with the book), as I was reading the first chapter, I kinda got the impression that much of the premise of the book was more or less a rehash of Law of Attraction, especially in one of the examples, where the author gave an example of a guy who asked for a $3,500.00 raise and got it just like that (although I would suspect there was more to the story. Then again, it's not my story).<br /><br />There are other minor problems I have with it, such as the section on fear. The author was talking about the types of fears and the \\"prescribed\\" action to take (according to him). I kinda had to smirk on one of those examples, when he talked about \\"fear of tornado\\" and the action to take: switch your attention to something totally different. Go to the yard and pull out weeds.... Yeah, OK. So, like what if there really WAS a tornado? Will pulling out weeds reverse the course of the tornado? In the beginning of the chapter, the author says \\"most fear today is psychological\\". Yeah. MOST. It's the ones that are not (like the tornado that really will come and won't disappear just because you go to the garden and pull out weeds) that you should really be concerned about.<br /><br />Also, and this is not so much this book as much as almost all (if not pretty much all) of the books I read, but the author does repeat himself in some areas, such as taking action on fear. But at least he does it in such a way that's not to, well... annoying (for lack of a better word).<br /><br />So, why the 5 stars (or the 4.5 stars, but Amazon can't do 4.5)? Simply put, aside from the minor problems, this book truly is dead on on alot of the points. Reading this book is, in many ways like reading [[ASIN:1439167346 How To Win Friends and Influence People]],[[ASIN:1416571035 The 28 Laws of Attraction: Stop Chasing Success and Let It Chase You]], [[ASIN:0060594896 The Success Principles(TM): How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be]], [[ASIN:1605094110 Goals!: How to Get Everything You Want -- Faster Than You Ever Thought Possible]] and, yes... even [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]] all together (heck... I could have probably saved myself the trouble of reading those books and purchased THIS instead!), as so many of the elements of those books are found in this. Yet, for some reason, this book puts the material in a way that really relates to me personally and even though I'm sure it's not the case, but reading this book is almost like coming across the material for the first time.<br /><br />Perhaps the thing that most resonates with me and something that many of the self-help books totally misunderstand is the subject of persistence, which the authors pretty much covers flawlessly. Many of the self-help books I've read tells you things such as \\"you've got to keep trying\\", \\"don't ever give up\\" or my personal favorite: \\"most people quit on the one yard line\\". Theauthor here talks about persistence, but talks about it in relation to something else he calls EXPERIMENTATION. In my practicalgoalachieving blog, I talk about this, too but call it something else, but it's pretty much similar. Basically, what the author says here is that it doesn't matter how \\"persistent\\" you are. If you're using bad strategies and techniques and you don't try different methods, you will still fail, and the author reinforces this point when he talked about an aspiring writer who was persistent in that he was a very diligent worker, but the techniques and he was using in his writing (and ultimately the manuscripts he was submitting) was terrible.<br /><br />Long story short: Yes, you may be at the one yard line. But if you use bad strategies and techniques, then your direction is wrong and you're at the one yard line facing the WRONG ENDZONE! Now, I know that in the subject of \\"persistence\\", many gurus will tell you one of the reasons why people are stuck where they are is because they don't persist. However, I personally feel that there are at least some who DO persist, and where persistence is NOT the problem, but they are stuck for other reasons (such as not experimenting enough).<br /><br />So that's one thing I absolutely LOVE about this book. The other thing is how this book truly focuses on improving one's self. Not just the inner, but the outer appearance as well (this is one part in my life that I have to work on). Yeah, the book [[ASIN:1416571035 The 28 Laws of Attraction: Stop Chasing Success and Let It Chase You]] also covers it, but with this book, it's not as extreme. That's just a personal preference for me. I feel outward appearance is important (just ask almost any person conducting a job interview), but overdoing it is not necessary. For developing your inner self, the author talks about the importance of listening, how to be sincerely interested in helping other people and how to treat people. Alot of the things he talks about is in [[ASIN:1439167346 How To Win Friends and Influence People]], and in that respect I personally feel this is an excellent complement to Dale Carnegie's book.<br /><br />Speaking of how to treat people, I really loved two of the examples he uses: one involves how a manager handled a situation where an employee came to work drunk, and the other one was how a boss handled terminating (yes, TERMINATING) an employee. Not for bad behavior or anything, but for sub-par work. I won't give away the story here, but let me tell you this: if more bosses and managers handled situations the way the two bosses in these stories handled their respective situations, there would be much, much fewer turnovers and you would have much fewer employee complaints. This is one of the few books that discusses this \\"touchy\\" subject.<br /><br />In summary, and as a side note, I'd like to say this: There are so many books that talk about Law of Attraction, and I've even read some of these books (see my Amazon review page and practicalgoalachieving blog for more), and the author even kinda goes into some of the Law of Attraction stuff, such as affirmations (the author uses the example of \\"creating your own commercial\\"), mission statements and vision. But to me, THIS is what the Law of Attraction is: Taking care of yourself on the outside (but not to the extent of overkill... unless you want to) and (to me, at least) even more important: being a fantastic person on the inside. One that treats people and respect others well. To be wonderful to yourself so you could be even more wonderful to others. When you do those things, people will be attracted to you. They will hang around you and if you're a business person, they will be inclined to bring you business. THAT, to me, is the REAL Law of Attraction and to me the essence of this book.it in relation to something else he calls EXPERIMENTATION. In my practicalgoalachieving blog, I talk about this, too but call it something else, but it's pretty much similar.

0670022411|4.0|Harkness creates a world of witches and vampires in the academic world. She adds historical data that will make you want retake history classes. The heroine, Diana Bishop struggles with being a witch. When she meets Matthew, a vampire, the journey begins. Diana fights her attraction to Matthew. She doesn't realize the predestined forces that will move her throughout the story.  I loved the way Harkness described the characters along the way. You never needed a note sheet to remember who they are. I understand it is a trilogy and cannot wait for the next book.
1401207529|2.0|I like Batman, I like Sin City, so I should like this. But I was just bored.  Now, I'm not much of a comic book reader, so maybe that may have something to do with it.  I think the main problem is that this felt like it should have been called Gordon, Year One, Batman almost takes a back seat.  At least it's a quick read.
1439190275|5.0|The New Atkins diet is even better than the 1st - with the addition of 20 net carbs during Induction (1st 2 weeks of the diet) it becomes way more manageable - By adding the ability to eat salad and leafy greens you can live and eat like a normal person and watch the weight literally fall off - I am on week two - 11 lbs down, and I feel great - The method was sound before, but now it is even better. If you've never been on Atkins before the book spells out exactly what happens when getting on the diet. If you've been on Atkins before, most of the book will be old news, but it gives you lists of Ok and not Ok foods along with their carb counts. And now Atkins has gone digital, so you can find out a lot of info through the Atkins website. A truly good diet for people who've tried and failed at everything else.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game looks and functions much better than the regular angry birds games. I wish they would add a new bird but it still keeps me hooked.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|why would anyone pay for this when its free on android market? doesn't make sense. now I have a twenty five word minimum hmmm ummm not enough
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I managed to nab this app for free while on special. It installed just fine and plays quite nicely on my HTC Incredible. Smoother, more colorful graphics with things happening in the background now, too. Even if I had paid a mere $0.99 for the game, I would be more than satisfied with my purchase! As an avid Angry Birds player, some of the factors that had begun to make the series wear a little thin on me are non-existent in this version. This being an all-birds affair (so far, at least) adds enough to freshen up the series. Admittedly, though, I miss hearing the pigs oink at the end of the cut scenes. That always made me laugh. =)<br /><br />Anyway, I've read a bunch of the reviews and as of March 22, 2011, this application downloaded, installed, and plays perfectly on my HTC Incredible!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|well, amazon says that the appstore is not available in my region.  so i am giving this app q star or even less if possible because the developers chose this crappy appstore instead oof android market
B004SBS8LA|1.0|this game runs great at first but after playing two levels it slows to a crawl. exiting the game and going back into it makes it run great again but it's a real pain to have to do that so often. it might be worth downloading for free, but it definitely isn't worth paying for.
6304696515|4.0|this was a refreshing movie to watch, since it was very well done--the characters were believable, intricate plot, great costumes, and highly emotionally charged.  Two things that keep this from being a great 5 star movie, and there are probably others, but what took me out of the story, i.e., interrupted the \\"fictional dream,\\" as it's called in literature, is Michelle Pfeiffer's character's initial change of heart that opened the door for Malkovich's character to get close to her.  It seemed like she was repulsed by him, then she wasn't.  It was a quick turn. Part of this is it just being a movie--you don't have a lot of time to show the minute changes that would cause a drastic change of heart.  The other thing was that Malkovich's character changes, realizes he was a really rotten person, and this is probably the climax of the movie, or at the least the beginning of the falling action, if one can separate the two; I felt that Glenn Close's character should have had a similar transformation, and perhaps she did, but it should have been more dramatized rather than through the ending that we are given, only because she and Malkovich are such rotten manipulators that seeing Glenn Close's character own up to her deeds--she is ultimately the one even behind Malkovich's characters nasty deeds--would have been highly satisfying for the viewer.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game is pretty and it brings the same fun from previous editions with nice scenes. Unfortunately new phases will launch only in a few months.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works well on Verizon Droid X. Sorry for the people who have AT&amp;T that can't get the Amazon appstore. Also for people in oter countries, i hope you guys can get this soon.
B003Y5H50G|3.0|Sometimes movies have concepts so grand and large-scale that potential viewers can't help but imagine to themselves in advance what they would do with such technology, powers, knowledge, etc.  Imagine if you had the ability to travel through time.  What would you do?  When would you go?  Our imaginations are sparked, and thus, movies about time travel are often disappointing, because their reach never achieves what we'd imagine ourselves doing.    LIMITLESS suffers from this as well.  Bradley Cooper plays an author with a serious case of writer's block.  He's smart, but messy and disorganized.  He's handsome but can't be bothered to take care of his appearance.  And he can't get going on the book he's supposed to write.  His girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) is finally tired of him and leaves.  But hope arrives in the form of a new drug that he is given by a distant acquaintance.  It will allow him to access \\"100% of his brain.\\"  Suddenly he's got phenomenal cognitive abilities...particularly the ability to take random scraps of past things he's encountered and to put them together into patterns that no one else can recognize.  It's like the chess player who can envision every possible move and the outcomes of each of those moves.  Cooper finishes his book (and it's brilliant) and then sets about making some serious money with his new powers.    With such incredible powers, he seems to strive to accomplish relatively little.  Yes, he wants to make money...that is certainly understandable and relatable.  But he doesn't see a big pattern for himself.  And as a viewer, I was constantly distracted by thinking...\\"wow, if I had HIS abilities, I'd do so much more.\\"  It felt a little bit like a failure of the imagination on the part of the filmmakers.  Thus, I felt vaguely disappointed in the film...a great idea that boiled down to a somewhat predictable \\"corporate espionage\\" kind of thing.    Because Cooper discovers that this drug wasn't exactly developed with the approval of the FDA.  The side-effects, particularly of not taking the drug every day, are unpleasant.  And there are some unpleasant, even murderous folks who want the drug, or at least want the abilities that Cooper now has to work to their advantage.  Who can he trust?  How will he get away from all the folks who are now following him?  What will he do when his stock of pills runs out?    It's all interesting but a bit generic.  Cooper makes a pretty good leading man here, but he generates little chemistry with the bland Abbie Cornish...so we are not terribly invested in their relationship.  Robert DeNiro is on hand to collect a paycheck as a big shot executive trying to pull of the most ambitious corporate merger in history...and he needs the talent Cooper brings to the table.      The most amusing part of the movie is when Cooper has to borrow his initial stake in the stock market from a Russian loan shark, who inadvertently discovers the pill Cooper is taking.  Suddenly, this thuggish character becomes a LOT more dangerous to Cooper than the corporate big-shots.  This showed some creativity and the menace and humor of these scenes was welcome.    I recommend LIMITLESS, but my admiration is not...well...limitless.  Cooper is good.  The basic concept is intriguing.  The \\"action\\" shenanigans are fairly tense, but feel lifted from hundreds of movies that came before.  I realize this is a lazy thing to say, but I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|I first read this when I was in high school and I am enjoying reading it this time around as much as I did back then. King is a gifted story teller. I love the relationships between the characters in this novel. It's the kind of book that is suspenseful and scary, but with enough humanity in it that one is sad to get to the end.

0061122416|5.0|This was by far the most brilliant piece of literary work I have ever gotten hands on. Paulo Coelho tells a thought provoking tale of the inspiration story of the Sheppard boy. The way that Coelho crafts details, imagery, and ideas is amazing. Though the book had a few flaws in the story toward the end, the book was a captivating read. I read it in one day because I was unable to put it down.    I would definitely read this book again and highly recommend to everyone. I look forward to reading more of his works.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|After reading all the Wodehouse tales when I was younger I was sure any film version of Jeeves would be pale in comparison. Stephen Fry proves me wrong, again and again. The comic genius of Fry and Laurie actually makes the TV episodes better than the printed word.  The sets are lavishly convincing and seem very BBC rather than A&E (which I think made the series). Anyhow, each episode is a complete story in itself but the entire series definitely tells a larger tale. There are 3 or 4 episodes on each disk and it's hard to watch just one at a sitting.<br /><br />The shows are not exactly like the books in many ways. The Jeeves in the the books keeps control over Bertie so that nothing shakes up his orderly existence. In the TV shows he seems to have a more altruistic reason for keeping Bertie out of random trouble and marriages-- for Bertie's own happiness. Also, characters like Aunt Agatha (the \\"Nephew Crusher\\") trust Jeeves' influence in the shows which was definitely not the case in the books.<br /><br />Anyhow, these are great stories and very well made. If you're in the mood for some good laughs and some architectural eye-candy give these a shows a look.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|Whenever Joe Bonamassa puts out a new album, I try to give it a lot of spins before I write a review.  He has yet to release a record that I don't enjoy, but I certainly like some more than others and it usually takes at least a week's worth of constant rotation before I can really judge where it falls in the pantheon of his work.  After receiving my pre-order of 'Dust Bowl' a full week before the release date and having it spinning non-stop since, I can safely say that this is easily Joe's best record since 'You and Me', and possibly right up there with the best he's ever done, alongside the aforementioned 'You and Me' and his early classic 'Blues Deluxe'.      Since 'You and Me', Joe has released a lot of great music, but this is the first truly great ALBUM.  'Sloe Gin' had a lot of knockout moments but lacked a lot of the fiery lead playing and didn't feel like a cohesive whole.  'The Ballad of John Henry' felt much more like a complete album, but it dragged in spots and for me, lacked a certain fire.  'Black Rock' blew me away at first with it's return to some of the blazing lead work, but the material was so all over the place that it didn't seem to have a natural flow to it.  'Dust Bowl' brings everything together.  Now, some old school fans are going to be disappointed that this isn't 'Blues Deluxe II'.  But you have to realize that Joe is no longer the artist that made that record.  He has moved beyond his rag-tag power trio knocking out rocked-up versions of blues chestnuts.  He's really become an artist, and he does a great job here of taking chances and keeping things varied, while never losing that signature Joe sound.  The originals and cover meld together perfectly, and the guest spots are brilliantly chosen.  Kevin Shirley's production is beefy, muscular, and spacious, so the album sounds loud and ballsy even when played at low volume.  Joe's vocals continue to get stronger and stronger with each passing release, and he really pours himself into his vocal performance here, and the lyrics to his original tracks are some of the strongest and most mature he's ever written.  And then of course, the guitar playing is simply off the charts brilliant.  The album kicks off with 'Slow Train', an insistent, stomping groover that kicks and snorts like a mule.  The tempo is slow, but the energy is high, so the song never sounds plodding the way some of the slower tracks on 'John Henry' did.  'Slow Train' then gives way to the title track, a deliciously slinky groover with great lyrics and a fantastic bass line.  Joe (and Kevin Shirley, I'm sure) wisely resisted the urge to have the tune explode into a power-chord orgy in the chorus, instead slowly building the intensity over the course of the entire song and allowing it to climax with Joe's soaring lead solo instead.  'Tennessee Plates' is up next, and is placed perfectly in the running order as a lighthearted yin to the powerful yang of the first 2 cuts.  It's a country boogie-blues cover of the Hiatt original, with Hiatt and Joe dueting on lead vocals and Vince Gill contributing some fantastic lead playing.  This is followed by 'The Meaning of the Blues', a slow-burn but intense blues featuring a great lead vocal from Joe.  Joe's leads are passionate and emotional, the kind that have you making 'guitar faces' while you're playing along on the air guitar.  Another Joe original, 'Black Lung Heartache' come next.  It starts off with some of the native Greek instrumentation that Joe first explored on 'Black Rock' before giving way to a grinding guitar orgy and, of course, some amazing leads.  This is one of the best original tracks that Joe has penned to date, simply great stuff.  No Joe album would be complete without the obligatory 12-bar shuffle blues, and we get that here in the form of the rollicking 'You Better Watch Yourself'.     The volume now gets turned down a notch for 'The Last Matador of Bayonne', a gorgeous and deliberate acoustic flavored number with a great,emotional lead vocal.  This track almost acts as an 'intermission' of sorts, but that's not to say it's a throwaway, as it's a beautifully constructed song and another of Joe's strongest ever original tunes.  It's followed by a cover of Free's 'Heartbreaker' featuring a vocal duet between Joe and his Black Country Communion bandmate, the 'Voice of Rock', Glenn Hughes.  I'm a huge fan of Free (and just about anything related to Paul Rodgers) and this cover is done with great reverence and emotion.  Joe's husky rasp and Glenn's soaring rock voice blend perfectly, and makes me hope there's be more shared lead vocals on the next BCC record!  'No Love on the Street' features some very nice strings and probably the best lead solo on the record.  From about 2:30 on you are bathed in an absolute downpour of incandescent, wah-wah drenched flurries that are simply awe-inspiring.  The tempo is then revved back up for 'The Whale that Swallowed Jonah', and rolling and tumbling Joe-penned rocker with a catchy chorus that has been one of my favorite tracks on the album.  Another duet is next, this time with Vince Gill (who previously contributed guitar work on 'Tennessee Plates') on his bouncy 'Sweet Rowena'.  Gill's smooth voice is another great foil for Joe's and they meld together perfectly, and Gill's country flavored picking is also a welcome addition.  The album winds up with 'Prisoner', a song originally performed by Barbra Streisand of all people.  Joe and co. have turned it into a soaring, minor-key blues rock ballad that would not sound out of place on a Free album circa 1972.     'Dust Bowl' is one of Joe Bonamassa's crowning achievements to date.  It's one of the most cohesive and well rounded albums he has ever recorded and will be hard to top the next time out.  Joe's albums are almost always a home run, but once in awhile he hits one of those steroid-assited, 600 foot Mark McGwire jobs, and 'Dust Bowl' is one of those.  This is a great place to start for new fans, and should delight all but the most stubborn of his old ones.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|much better version than the ad filled other one that creates lag. Probably going to uninstall the original one after this. if you have an issue installing app store use the default browser, skyfire has been know to cause issues.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After amazon store update upable to play. Had to reinstall to play and lost all previous saved data. Never had this issue with apps from droid market will go back there for all future app purchases.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloaded Amazon Appstore, installed the free angry birds rio which corrupted my SD Card. Guess that's their plan to make money. 'Here's a free $1 app now you get to buy a new $40 microSD card, thanks for your business'....

B004MPESSY|4.0|I really liked this a lot. Very well done. Strong and very gritty. Unlike the \\"Last House On The Left\\" remake which was better on a technical level, it was not as effective a horror film. But with \\"Spit\\" I thought it was much more effective than the original in many ways, and the acting is so much better. It is a tough movie to watch , but if you like this kind of horror it is worth a look. Weird to say, because the movie is so graphically strong with rape, gore and violence, but its very artistically shot.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|spend half an hour to get the mail, downl amazon apk, re-sign a card on 1 click (already present but dont ask me why they wanted to redo it), many rio add to card then \\"purchase failed\\" at download, and finally something like not avaible .... a real bloatware that market i said, uninstalled now (thx to android to work).

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I must say that of all my years of watching television, including The CW series \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"90210\\", I never (and I mean NEVER) thought I would fall for \\"The Vampire Diaries\\". I've seen clips of the show, prior to watching the series from the beginning, and it didn't grab me so much. It is a lot of conflict/drama going on in the series, and if you haven't followed it from the \\"Pilot\\" episode, you will be seriously lost.    First off, vampires. Not as savage as the \\"True Blood\\" vamps, but more violent than the ones in \\"Twilight\\". I think what makes this show great is the sibling rivalry. Yes, Stefan Salvatore and Damon Salvatore are the vampire brothers of the series, fighting for one Elena Gilbert--the series lead. The story takes place in Mystic Falls, VA where Stefan finally mainstreams to get closer to Elena. The conflict?--well, she looks like his ex, Katherine, who also turns out to be his (SPOILER ALERT) sire. So, Elena's doppelganger is Stefan's ex. No problem; except, not only was Katherine Stefan's sire, she was also Damon's. Conflict!    The series is watchable and is powerfully written. A lot of unexpected twists and it does treat the viewers with extreme care. Most vampire shows sugarcoat some of the violence, but this show is far from that. It is compared to \\"Twilight\\" because of certain hold backs, but on the contrary, it is NOTHING like \\"Twilight\\". The show is based more on the brothers fighting for the girl, also showing interactions between the community, their family, and friends.    I highly recommend this show, also pledging the \\"don't knock it 'til you try it\\" speech.
0446678430|5.0|I don't understand why readers are giving this book 1 star and 2 stars. It is absolutely phenomenal.    These critics talk about repitition in the book, but you have to understand that he wants the information that he relays to stick in your mind; and stick in your everyday beliefs about how you want your life to be. They also say he boasts about himself. You've misinterpreted. He is CONFIDENT. He knows his strengths and successes,and ALSO has admitted his weaknesses and failures. He is in no way trying to portray himself as a god or a perfect businessman. If that were the case I would dislike the book. In order for him to grasp his target audience, he must obviously make them feel that they can do it too. (Eg. Through admitting his failures and challenges)    I live in a country where some of the things he talks about do not apply. For example, real estate. I live on a small island and there are prime locations for real estate and other areas are not. So in locations where we can only dream of owning real estate only appreciates and appreciates in value.     But I now have a wholesome understanding of what he's trying to say after reading the book. I am not looking for a how-to book. No one thing can relate to everyone, and that's where your strategic foresight and innovation must come in to apply to your situation and the market you intend to penetrate.    I am launching a website in April, [...], and I bought 5 books in one purchase to do book reviews. I told the employee to give me whatever you think is good. This was the first book I read. Now I doubt I can read anything else but his books. So I will be back to the bookstore to purchase every available book they have written by Robert Kiyosaki.    I must admit also, that the direction he took in explaining things, that to be quite honest we already know but probably cannot make sense of it like he does, really put everything into perspective, and was truly remarkable.  I really don't like reading; I bought these books by force to prepare for my website; and I have never felt soooo content; truly happy; and walking away with knowledge I would have never known, ALL by reading this book.    I plan to market him like crazy on the website. lol.    But as he said, if you have no intention of coming out of your skin and changing your habits, and using your leverage, and growing up and admiting that you will fail sometimes, then this book is not for you. But if you want to retire rich and retire young, then this book is definitely for you.    Mr. Kiyosaki, if you ever read this, please contact me via the website above-mentioned. I would love to meet you.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|simply put, this young woman can really belt it out.  But that's not all there is to her latest album.  She is not a shallow performer and doesn't shy away from challenging both her vocal abilities, but also the themes in her lyrics.    I play this album regularly and I'm old enough to be her grandmother.
B004H2ZFPW|3.0|Just take her 1st album and her 3rd album and combine the two, and you have \\"Goodbye Lullaby.\\" With all of the latest competition for the top spots on the charts, I expected something a little more innovative and creative, but if you like Avril Lavigne in general you will enjoy this album. I hope she revisits her \\"Under My Skin\\" style once more though.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Let me just first say: \\"Congratulations to Ms. Jennifer Hudson for standing strong after the tragedies in her life and staying true to herself!\\" The success that she has gained in her life is equivalant to the genuine and deserving person that she is. With her long-anticipated Sophomore effort, 'I Remember Me,' Jennifer Hudson effectively delivers. Her first self-titled album was amazing but as Jennifer mentioned in an interview: \\"I had the opportunity to put ME into this album\\" and it definitely shows. With songs that are inspiring, encouraging, songs that make you think, cry, and want to dance, 'I Remember Me' is on it's way to the Grammys and will easily become a favorite for all who hear it. Although all of the tracks are amazing, well-written and performed with substance, here are some of my favorite songs off of the album:    Track #4: Angel (Produced by Alicia Keys. JENNIFER THIS SHOULD BE THE NEXT SINGLE FROM THE ALBUM)  Track #3: Where You At (Hit Single)  Track #1: No One Gonna Love You (This is the jam!)  Track #11: Feeling Good (Everyone loves this track from Jennifer's Weight Watchers commercial; By the way you look great Jennifer with the weight loss, although you were always beautiful)  Track #2: I Got This (Beautiful song)  Track #5: I Remember Me (Title track)  Track #9: Don't Look Down (Cool Dance Track)  Track #12: Believe (This is definitely the ballad of the album and Jennifer delivers, as always!)    Excellent effort with this album Jennifer. I cannot wait to see the many successes you will continue to gain throughout your already stellar career! Congratulations on everything Jennifer and remember the formula to success is staying true to YOURSELF, remaining HUMBLE, trusting in GOD, and loving your FAMILY, FRIENDS, and FANS! EVERYONE GO AND BUY 'I REMEMBER ME,' AN ALBUM YOU WILL NEVER FORGET!

B003EYVXXW|5.0|The storyline of this film is different than most ancient Roman movies. For one, the lead character is an independent free thinking woman,very unusual for the time period.

This film moves fast,and has a lot of detail.

B000V5TV22|4.0|I bought this to plug into my laptop so I can use OpenCPN, a free open source nautical chart program which uses free NOAA charts (opencpn.org), while I navigate the East coast. When I installed the drivers from the included CD before plugging it into my 64-bit Win7 laptop. When I plugged it in, it was immediately recognized and provided position info for OpenCPN and Microsoft Streets & Trips. During a drive from Savannah to Pensacola it never lost track of the satellites. I also have Linux installed and although the included CD driver will not work, Ubuntu 10.10 recognized it when I \\"told\\" it that it was plugged in the first time. It automatically recognizes it every time it is installed now with no fuss.  The only complaints I have is that it doesn't have the support libraries for Linux on the CD and the included \\"GPS Info\\" program that comes with it is garbage because it doesn't recognize the COM ports on my 64 bit machine. (It worked fine on an old 32 bit). I don't use it anyway so it's not a big issue.  This is my second unit. I have had the first one for about 2 years and beat it up severely while sailing. It was still working when it fell overboard. It's waterproof but, unfortunately, doesn't float! (Neither did the laptop it was attached to. Ouch!)  Good quality for the money, durable and useful across many program and Operating system platforms.

1400032717|5.0|The author's take on what it would be like to be a high-functioning autistic teenager trying to cope with a world where people constantly behave inexplicably and have no intuition in to his needs and responses.  I hope that there's better support for autistic children now, at least in some places.  Christopher tries so hard to understand and interact with the world, and has been taught and developed relatively few coping mechanisms.  He seemed remarkably real -- I think that's why a few readers are disappointed to understand that he's an invention of the author.    This is an easy read.  I'd love to learn about what happens to Christopher as he grows up.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|THE TOURIST has many flaws, not the least of which is the fact that it doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind whether it is a suspense thriller, a romantic comedy, or a travelogue.  But despite all of its weaknesses, on the small screen in the home it comes across as an Italian delicacy well worth watching. Bouncing around from Paris to Scotland Yard and eventually to serenissima Venice the visuals (thanks to cinematographer John Seale's ability to capture the flavors of Venice so beautifully) steal the show. The story written by none other than Julian Fellowes ('Gosford Park', 'Separate Lies',  'Young Victoria', 'Vanity Fair', 'From Time to Time') with director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, Christopher McQuarrie, and J&eacute;rôme Salle (whose 2005 French thriller 'Anthony Zimmer' spawned this American version) is quirky by entertaining, and the musical score by James Newton Howard adds distinction to the film.<br /><br />Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie, dressed to the nines and looking like a mannequin) is on a mission: she is being closely followed on secret video by Scotland Yard Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) and Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) who expect her to meet up with one Alexander Pearce and gain back the money stolen from crime lord Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff). She eludes capture and boards a train to Venice where her instructions from Pearce suggest that she meet a man who looks like Pearce.  Interpol is engaged and the Italian police - led by Sergente Cerato (the extraordinarily handsome Alessio Boni) et al - pickup the chase for Scotland yard.  On the train Elise meets American spy-fiction fan and math teacher Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) and manipulates his emotions and attention to the point that Frank follows Elise to Venice - and the mystery thickens. Amid interesting characters are 'The Englishman' (Rufus Sewell) and Conte Filippo Gaggia (the ultimate Italian leading man Raoul Bova, remembered for his important role in 'Under the Tuscan Sun') who add to the suspense and incidents of mistaken identity.  To say anything further would rob the viewer of what little suspense the script contains.<br /><br />The very fine cast seems to be sleepwalking through much of the story, but they are still so terrific to watch that they make the film a fine evening's entertainment.  Probably this film is better on DVD than it was one the big screen in theaters: the story seems more intimate and the relationships more credible.

It appears that this autocorrect feature has a rather dirty mind yet really tries to make you not curse in text messages. Who cares if it changes pens to penis, parents to parrots, pick me up to oil me up, or hahahaha to Shabaka? The humor factor to it would make me want to use autocorrect to get funny messages like this to brighten a day. Some may be in the same boat as me on this, right?<br /><br />I brought this book along to read while in a waiting room. I ended up reading half of the book while sitting there and found it incredibly hard to not giggle or laugh out loud when reading some of these amusing text messages. Sure, the people around me probably thought I was weird, but who cares? I bet I had a better time waiting for my appointment than they did!<br /><br />Overall, I found this book to be extremely funny and a very good read for anyone that wants to laugh.

B000N0WCLC|5.0|Where do I even begin to describe this film. Well, first off, we have an incredible cast that features other talents aside from DiCaprio. Houson and Connelly support this film immensely and provide the necessary mood that complements DiCaprio's character. The fact that they can immerse the audience in a seemingly tragic real-life based story is very commendable. This movie is sure to tug on some heart strings and make you feel the pain that actual people have experienced half way around the world. I would highly recommend this film and I thought this was DiCaprio's best film that year (2006). Though he was good in the Departed (2006), I'd have to say his role in Blood Diamond slightly surpasses his role in the Departed  in my opinion. But don't take my word for it, go watch this masterpiece and form your own opinions =)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice improvement to angry birds.  It's a lot smoother and has the 3-D gaming feel to it.  Look foward to the updates in the future.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|When this movie was announced, I was thrilled to bits and very excited. As a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, here was a legitimate big screen adaptation of the brilliant works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Guy Ritchie is a highly capable director (Snatch and Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were extremely enjoyable movies) and Robert Downey Jr was coming off of Iron Man. December arrived and the movie opened very well. By the time I got to seeing it (on BluRay)it was a big hit worldwide. After all this hype and expectation, the movie definitely disappointed.<br />It is not as if the movie sucked. In parts, it was fun. In parts, it was intriguing. But as a whole, it lacked the thrill and mystery that Holmes evokes. The Jeremy Brett Holmes brought an intensity that was sorely lacking in Downey. The steampunk sets were cool but somewhere in the big budgets and even bigger stars, A.C.Doyle was lost. The humor was OK but forced. The action was fine by Hollywood standards and it will satisfy the non-Holmes background viewers who come looking for an actioner.<br />I miss my Granada TV production Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes whose eyes sparkled and body twitched for action. The mystery was his to solve and the charm of Victorian England was there everywhere. Sometimes, keeping this simple helps and works too. The big screen Holmes has everything, just a little too much of it.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|I've been a Joe fan for over 10 years, and I own everything he's recorded. I've enjoyed every release, and this one is no different. The one difference is that I'm so used to the excellence that sometimes I think I expect too much. I have to give each new release several listens through in order to try and be objective. I've been through this one 3 times...and started a 4th.     I still think that \\"The Ballad of John Henry\\" is my favorite, and the first two discs (New Day Yesterday and So, It's Like That) hold a special place in my heart because it was how I got to know Joe, and coincided with several live shows I saw up close and personal in small bars...    That being said, this is a great album. The songwriting is strong and mature, and it's a great collection of songs. The originals are pretty fresh, and the covers were well selected. Some rockin' blues, some slow blues, some different blues. Even a boogie blues tune with a little Nashville flare.     All in all, it's a very strong release. Produced very well, and you can't argue with Joe's tone. Fat. And his command of the instrument is better than anyone's. His vocals are maturing quite nicely, too.     If you like Joe, it's a must have. If you want to get to know him, it would be a great place to start.    Joe says it's his best release. I'm not sure, but I like it a lot.

0439023521|5.0|In the ruins of North America, a country called Panem has arisen from the ashes. Consisting of a Capitol and twelve Districts, the country is strict with its citizens. To commemorate the victory of the Capitol over the districts that revolted against it early in the nation's history, each year Panem has an event called the Hunger Games. Twenty-four competitors - one boy and one girl from each District - are selected for the honor of representing their home in an arena where only one will emerge victorious. For the winner, a victory means fame, fortune, and an easier life.    However, the Hunger Games are a far cry from the Olympics. Part Roman gladiators, part Survivor, each contestant - or \\"tribute - is armed with one set of clothes and sent into a strange land. The rules are simple: the last one alive wins. Tributes are encouraged to kill each other, outsmart each other in terms of food and water supplies, and must rely on their wits and the elements to battle disease, fire, flood, and any other surprises that might arise.     Katniss Everdeen is sixteen the year her 12-year old sister, Prim, is selected to represent District 12 in the games. She quickly volunteers to take Prim's place, and is quickly whisked away to a world she's never seen in the Capitol to prepare for what is literally a battle for her life. Her co-tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, a boy she knows from school who saved her from starvation several years earlier. As the two prepare for the strange competition (which is shown on live television across the country), they form a strange bond. But how much is for the cameras - companies sponsor tributes they are supporting - and how much is reality? And will it matter when they must kill each other to survive?    Suzanne Collins' \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a frightening novel about a post-apocalyptic community where this type of horror is seen as spectacle, where the perversity of having children fight each other to the death is a sport to be waged upon, and where human life and love have no real value. Early on, I found myself disturbed by the premise, but I was completely absorbed in the story. This isn't one of those so-bad-you-can't-look-away trainwrecks of a book. It's a well-written, realistic take on a world that we hopefully will never encounter. And while I don't usually go for dystopian tales, I couldn't put it down.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|I Have to admit that this DVD was a purchase on impulse. I saw the cover and the Robin Hood name on it and I thought why not ? Now, a new Robin Hood version is out it couldn't be 'THAT' Bad now could it ? Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />I'm not gonna rehearse the plot (not that there is one anyway) but I'm gonna explain my reasons for disliking this movie. Keep in mind that this film is intended to be about \\"Robin Hood\\" does that name sound familiar ? The Prince of thieves who steal from the rich and give to the poor. So, Bear with me:<br /><br />-Reason #1 : Robin Hood wore \\"Green\\" that's right, it was green he didn't wear black, yellow or purple he wore Green. In this movie We see our \\"Robin Hood\\" which is played by \\"Russell Crow\\" wearing Black I don't even recall him wearing \\"Green\\". I'm not really sure why is that, can it be possible that the director was lacking of Green fabric.<br /><br />-Reason #2 :Robin Hood was a man in his 20s not in his 40s, which is why the casting of \\"Russell Crow\\" as \\"Robin Hood\\" is horrible. Don't get me wrong, I like Russell Crow I enjoy most of his movies and I think he's a great actor but for him to play the role of a 20 year old young Robin Hood while he's obviously in his prime is inconvenient. I would've accepted the casting choice if he played an Old Robin Hood but this is about a Robin Hood that has just started his Robin Days and the legend has him as a young man not in his 40s. The same thing applies to Maid Marion, she was young, never married and therefore never widowed. Now Cate Blanchett is beautiful but she's a little bit old for the role of Maid Marion.<br /><br />-Reason # 3: The \\"Merry Men\\" were Outlaws living in the forest, That's right, they were Men not children. Again another wrong casting choice. \\"Did Mr. Scott got things messed up or what ?\\"<br /><br />-Reason # 4: Robin Hood fought the lords of England, stole their money and gave it to the poor. The Lords of England were his real enemies and so was the King. He was an outlaw, never fought for the King and he didn't give a dam* about the French.<br /><br />So, Yeah those were my Reasons for disliking this movie and I would've happily ignored these inaccuracies about Robin Hood if and only if the movie was \\"entertaining\\". However, the movie was not ! It was boring and long. I just couldn't get myself to like any of the characters especially that stupid King. I couldn't believe I was watching a Robin Hood movie, there was no stealing from the rich or giving to the poor what soever. I even had to check the Disc's title a couple of times just to make sure the title was \\"Robin Hood\\" not Robin Wood or maybe Rood or anything like that.<br /><br />Mr. Scott I understand that you wanted to make an Original version of Robin Hood but couldn't you at least kept \\"some\\" facts straight instead of making an entire story up ? Or better Yet made an entire new fictional character named Robin instead of Robin Hood ? Who used to fight the French and work for the King. The events of this movie could've happen to anyone there was really nothing that made me feel connected to the actual Robin Hood except the names.<br /><br />If you want to watch a Robin Hood movie, I recommend you see the Kevin Costner version I don't know why everyone hates it but it's definitely better than this crap ! I also recommend you watch the Robin Hood Men in Tights it's the better one of the three and it's funny and entertaining. If you didn't like it you can always watch the Disney Robin Hood, I know he's a wolf but he actually wears Green and he looks young !<br /><br />This movie however wasn't even satisfying on the action part, the only fighting scenes were at the very end and they weren't enough ! I've seen Ridley Scott do better than this. If you want to watch a good Scott film a better movie would be Gladiator, the main character is played by Russell Crow also and the plot is more entertaining and memorable. It also has more fighting/action scenes.King and he didn't give a dam* about the French.

B004SCI9BS|4.0|I think this album is almost as good as their first two. I think all the songs are catchy and catch myself singing them at work. It seems like either you hate the songs or you love them, and I love them. This will be all I listen to for a while!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|The sexy Robert Downy Jr plays the role of Sherlock Holmes in this fast paces, new but fun version of the most famous fictional detective. Guys you're in it for a treat and Ladies well you get to see Robert isn't that enough ? Well, if it wasn't you won't be disappointed either because this movie has a lot of 1) action scenes 2)great acting 3) good special effects that made me feel like I was in London.<br /><br />This movie has a plot too, which is something because usually action packed films have little to none plot whatsoever. I don't know about you guys but when I picked this movie up, I wasn't expecting something out of LOTR or an Oscar winning material film. I was expecting a movie that delivers \\"Pure Entertainment\\" just to have some fun watching it and this movie didn't fail me. I was actually expecting it to be worse because everyone was talking about how good it is and I'm always suspicious of Hyped movies they almost always turn out to be \\"overrated\\" but this film was not thankfully !<br /><br />The City of London is going through a series of unexplained, weird events that is causing mysterious deaths and other incidents too. The problem ? They can't blame it on the villain who was a supposed wizard because he is already dead. Then who is behind all these crimes ? Leave it to our favorite Smart, witty and sarcastic detective and his best friend Dr.Watson (Jude Law) to find out. However, Holmes must get kicked in the a$$, get into arguments with his best friend and confess old enemies before he solve the mystery.<br /><br />Like what other reviews has already stated, Robert Downy Jr brings a different Sherlock Holmes to life. He is still smart and able of doing his job but you won't see him wearing a glove, scrabbling in his notes or or wearing that 19th Century Glasses anytime soon. Instead you'll see him moving around and kicking some a$$ while still collecting evidence. This Sherlock Holmes is never boring and he has guts !<br /><br />The Good thing about this movie is that it is rated PG-13 which means that you can watch it with your teenage kids as a family.ted PG-13 which means that you can watch it with your teenage kids as a family.

B000BYA5G4|4.0|At first I really didn't know what was I into. Like Most Nic Cage films I thought this one was going to be action-packed and fast paced think almost like (Gone in 30 Seconds and Next kinda), well I mean don't get me wrong by the title of the movie was \\"Lord Of War\\" and the poster with the guy behind Nic holding a gun makes it look like an action movie, it definitely didn't look Sci/Fi or Comedy so I supposed maybe it was action... I was wrong ! Why I don't care ? Because this movie despite it being different from most Cage films was surprisingly wonderful ! Don't you just love it when you find a pleasant surprise ? This movie was more than just a story, it was based on true events and an outlook on Humanity and morality.<br /><br />The movie is told from a weapon dealer's POV Yuri Orlov (Nic Cage) and his experience with dealing illegal weapons and selling them to foreign troops, governments etc.... Apparently this illegal exportation and importation of weapons (mostly guns and rifles to be used in wars etc...) has gained Yuri millions of dollars but in exchange ripped him off his mortality, humanity, family and most importantly his soul.<br /><br />This movie was interesting to watch, I knew very little about this subject of weapon dealing but I think I actually gained some knowledge from watching this. Of course, Yuri doesn't go on sealing weapons and wandering freely he is being pursued by the legal authorities who are trying to find him guilty and almost succeed till the last moment. Then you've got his social life which consist of his relationship with his Ukrainian parents, wife and child and his younger brother who is played by (Jared Leto). However, mostly this film focuses on Yuri's illegal activities.<br /><br />The casting choice I thought were very good, the acting was excellent too. The setting/customs etc.... They were all very believable.<br /><br />Definitely a movie to watch !

0811870413|3.0|Tartine bakery in San Francisco by far makes some of the best bread and pastries I've ever tasted anywhere in the world. When I found out they had a cook book I was keen to give it a try.    When you first open the book, it is elegantly designed and laid out. Once you start reading the introduction, you realise the craftsmanship of baking bread and how much Chad Robertson has dedicated his life to this long forgotten art form. You begin to learn a lot about old French bakery techniques that Chad has developed and made his own.     The book however is probably a bit advance for the beginner that needs more specific instruction versus intuition. Some of the instructions are a bit vague like grab a handful of flour and fill a small container half way with water. The lack of measurement is confusing and at times you are not sure if you are using too much or too little so you are constantly experimenting and re-doing steps. The pictures in the book look great but they are a bit pretty versus practical. At times you are not sure what the pictures are or what step that relates to so once again you just have to experiment and work out if you're doing it right. I think if you had some baking skills, you would know what to do but since I'm a true beginner it took a lot of work figuring it out.    Overall I still think it's a great book teaching great techniques that you're not going to learn elsewhere and I thank Chad for his willingness to share his lifetime of knowledge.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|What makes this great is the fact that it's free (albeit for a limited time), contains no ads, and plays on my rooted Hero whereas the original Angry Birds no longer will. Still a little choppy, but I'm sure it's because of my phone's aging hardware.

B004A8ZWT2|4.0|The Tourist is a very entertaining film. Also it is very stylish in a great setting, Venice (Italy). You don't want to look at this movie as a serious film, but rather a light-hearted story and flick for relaxation. Sure, due to the location, much more could have been packed into this motion picture, like e.g. they could have added scenes from the Venice carnival and the \\"traditional\\" trip to Murano in their glass factories, etc., but overall much attention to detail like Jolie's and Depp's wardrobe, the hotel, the bird's eye camera shots of Venice, etc. has been paid and it shows. Donnersmarck has really a sense of style.    The storyline itself is fun and don't consider this film a thriller, but rather an entertaining flick with a touch of comedy in the style of films from the 60s, like e.g. comparable to films with e.g. Peter Sellers or similar. And sure in a real thriller the storyline could have been fleshed out a bit, but \\"The Tourist\\" is just not this kind of movie. Also the soundtrack overall is actually very good. If you take a look at the film in this light, you'll love it and watching it will be an entertaining experience and that's what it's all about.
B001I82RVS|5.0|It is hard to say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said. I was lucky enough to first see it at a special screening at a movie theater and the I have watched it several times on DVD. With my limited attention span, that says a lot.     This movie is pure action, pure gore. It is one of the best films combining modern Japanese horror with action that I have seen.     I'm not going to warn anybody why not to see this film if you don't like blood, guts and gore, because the title says it all. What must be said is that it is more than a horror film. There is a lot of subtle, very dark humor in this movie and a lot of secretive plot lines that you really need to watch for. The director/writer Yoshihiro Nishimura and the other two screenwriters Kengo Kaji and Maki Mizui really went out of their way to make this a very unique samurai horror, gore film.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great looking game. Good graphics and music. Can't wait for the updates, although they shouldn't space them out that far apart. Like the boss battles.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Will Smith son stars in this and he does well but I just dont like these young kids starring in movies they tend to grow up to become arrogant teens (I.E.

I watched it with a younger crowd they seemed to have enjoyed it aswell.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|Put together Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, as glamorous as ever here, then throw them into a situation in which Russian gangsters and British intelligence officers are after them. Place most of the scenes in Paris and Venice. Add a twist or two. This should be a thrilling movie, but it's not.<br /><br />\\"The Tourist\\" opens with Angelina's character under surveillance in Paris. A mysterious man, Alexander Pearce, is wanted by numerous agencies and criminals for having stolen billions of dollars and disappeared. Angelina is his girlfriend, and everyone assumes she is the best way to find him again. She receives a hand-delivered note from Mr. Pearce telling her to get on the next train to Venice, and to befriend and travel with a man that looks like Pearce--to distract and deceive the authorities, we assume.<br /><br />She does as she is told, picking out Depp's character, who is a math teacher and widower from Wisconsin. Soon, he is caught up in the intrigue, since many now believe he is Pearce. This is further confirmed by Angelina's budding love for him and her impetuous decision to give him a kiss in full view of those keeping her under surveillance. Yes, eventually, we get a few chase scenes, a few twists, and some humorous bits of dialogue. But this movie plods along on poor writing, with every gangster being cut from cardboard, every intelligence officer lacking intelligence, and even the hints at chemistry between Depp and Jolie stifled by a plot that is surprisingly thin for such a grand international thriller.<br /><br />I had high hopes. They were far from met. Yes, \\"The Tourist\\" has its moments, but this is one tour I'd rather forget.
B004GHBQ7O|3.0|As a long time Green Day fan, I was very excited to get the combo pack and revisit some of my favorite songs on the tour. The tour did everything from new hits, too really old school stuff like \\"1,000 Hours\\", \\"Paper Planes\\", \\"The Grouch\\", \\"Hitchin' a Ride\\", and so many more awesome old hits that I hadn't heard live in ages. However, the CD failed to mention any of them. Half the songs were newer hits, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it weren't for the fact that the other songs were songs that I had heard done live over and over again, and most had been on \\"Bullet in a Bible.\\" It was just the same stuff they do every single concert, and to top it all off, they didn't even include Minority.    However, even though the DVD's song choice followed a similar pattern, it was nice to see an entire concert front to back without anything spliced in between. It was a great show, shot very well, and the audio mixing was done awesomely as well too! It was a nice rush and Green Day energy that this package needed. That being said, I did find the bonus material to be a bit lacking. I expected a lot more for what I paid for.    In short, if this is your first live Green Day album, go for it! It will satisfy new fans, and fans looking for a good, basic live package of Green Day songs and videos. However, the older fans will find it to be a copy of \\"Bullet in a Bible\\", and may not find anything new worth investing in.

B002ZG99TK|3.0|***spoiler alert, kind of***    Why was the owner of the railroad company not thrown in prison?      He made a life and death decision based on potential financial losses, not human losses.  The right call would have been to derail the train in the unpopulated area.  He put thousands of lives at risk in order to protect his money.    WE CANNOT ALLOW THESE LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS TO BE MADE BY PRIVATE CORPORATIONS.  WE MUST HAVE ACCOUNTABLE, TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT.    For those of you who don't understand politics the Republican party is pushing an agenda of \\"privatization and deregulation\\".  That means all services would be run for profit by private corporations with no supervisory government oversight.  That means life and death decisions will be made behind closed doors, with no accountability, and in the interests of profit before humanity.    Do you want government oversight of the police?  Republicans don't.      Do you want government oversight of the military?  Republicans don't.    Do you want government oversight of nuclear power plants?  Republicans don't.    Roads, bridges, environmental protection, medicine, toxic waste management, water treatment, internet, airports, digital voting technology, every service you can possibly think of....Republicans want to turn all these services over to private corporations with no government supervision, regulation, or standards of conduct.    Democrats want GOOD government.  Republicans want NO government.  Why?  Republicans are corrupt lowlifes who want to exploit politics for personal wealth.  They will hurt YOU if it gets more money in their pocket.  This movie is a perfect example.    ....and more about the movie    -Shame there was no accountability...the owner should have been thrown in prison.  The Glavin guy should not have been fired but thrown in prison.  The idiot who caused the whole mess should have been thrown in prison instead of ending up in the \\"fast food industry\\".    -Why was his wife played by a 14 year old girl?  That was gross.    -Denzel cut Chris' lines...don't you just hate that hollywood ego trip garbage?    -Don't Chris Pine's plastic surgery lips just piss you off?    -Fox news is not a legitimate news organization.  It's a mouthpiece for the Republican party.      Otherwise yeah the movie was good.  Exciting.
B004MPESSY|1.0|I think anyone who can sit through this movie, without leaving as soon as the rape-sene begins, is a sick, derelict person. This isn't a movie, it is a sick person's idea of entertainment! Anyone who watches this whole movie, without leaving in total disgust, needs to be in the prisons build for the sick-evil persons, that would watch this, without throwing up. I don't know what happens in the end, but I certainly hope, these \\"men\\" get what they deserve. Which is to be tortured to death, for what they did to this INNOCENT woman. To die a PAINFUL and torturous death. I cannot think of efficient terms to express my disgust, at a movie obviously made for the derelict of this world. While some sick \\"men\\" might sit through this, I seriously doubt, any women would. I certainly couldn't. If I could think of words horrible-enough to describe this movie, my compassion for the female species of this planet, would not allow me to write it, here, or anywhere else. I have never been so angry and disgusted in my entire life! I think people who make films like this, should be in prison with the rest of the sick fks of the world. I have seen many movies in my 61 years, but this is the first one, I refuse to finish watching. Rape, is the most VILE of all crimes. To put this on film, is to allow the act of rape to be committed every time it is watched. It is no wonder why our \\"society\\" is in such disarray, and our prisons so full. This isn't entertainment, it is the lowest and most VILE of all act human's can exhibit. I think murder, would be a more compassionate way of ending someone's life; rather than, an act of rape. I wish I never saw as much as I did. This is the MOST VILE movie, I have ever witnessed. I'm glad only at the opportunity of being able to shut-it-OFF!

What was said about immigrant children from far-off countries doing better than their American counterparts is true. In this country we expect too little from our children.

But season six I almost watched from start to finish in one weekend. Hunt becomes more likeable, as does Lexi - two characters I'd disliked in earlier seasons. I'll watch these episodes again, whereas season five only needs to be seen once, just to keep up with the plot.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think they did a great job and you can't go wrong with free for 24 hours... Even though I would gladly pay the 99¢.  My only complaint is that it seems to lag when taping the screen with the special birds. Evo 4G, 2.2
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I have watched Temple Grandin a number of times, will watch it several more, and we have purchased copies to share.  The information is more than can be digested or even recognized in one viewing.  Recommended for everyone with even the slightest interest or exposure to Autism.
B00030590I|5.0|This DVD was a gift to a friend.. to my \\"best\\" friend!<br />A \\"must see\\" movie, I was able to see at the theatre, BIG screen.<br />Both the \\"story\\" and the \\"music\\" express a deep meaning of connection<br />that made me \\"cry\\" during many parts of the movie..<br />HERO is \\"moving\\" on many levels for an adult viewer.<br />It's not a \\"video\\" game or a \\"Bruce Lee\\" action movie.<br />Very \\"spiritual\\".. and a great gift to a \\"best\\" friend.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|I believe the best option for this great new release, is the Deluxe Special Limited Edition CD/DVD Combo, with 4 additional bonus songs. Just Scroll down the product listing for this product, or enter Deluxe Edition, and you'll find it listed. The deluxe edition is definitely the best option on this great new release. I truly believe this information is helpful, for potential buyers, so you can know, there is a better option available. But, it is only for a limited time. So, when they're gone, they're gone. Thanks!!!!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I could not put this book down. This is a book that all high schools should assign to their students. It's amazing how Nikki Sixx was able to survive. The book shares extremely personal things - some which I am sure he's not happy about looking back; but hopefully more people will read this book and realize the effects that drugs can have on you.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|I saw this in the theater, and had a really great time.  Great action story that does a great job of weaving in action hero's that can still carry a movie.  What a ride seeing all these guys on one flick.  Well done!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Game looks and runs great. No lag or frame rate issues. Good improvement over the first Angry Birds. Don't blame Amazon if you can't get it, get a better network.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It appears the birds have turned xenophobic because they won't install on non-American phones. This is utter nonsense in the 21st century, what does it matter where in the world I am?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great addition to the series. More fluid and improved over prior editions. Like the change to freeing the birds from their cages. Very enjoyable! Get it!
B000A3DFZE|3.0|Everyone should know by now that Clapton no longer rocks on his recordings. Oh he'll play the old songs live but he obviously sees rock as a younger man's game.Is there a point to playing yet another hard rocking guitar solo? If its in him he'd rather it not come out. Instead of recording songs to play in bars, arenas and stadiums, Clapton records songs to play for his family and friends. He records in safe,inoffensive, nonrevealing formats, pop and blues.  He just doesn't want to be the guy that made those Yardbirds/Cream/Blind Faith/Derek and the Dominoes albums. He has matured and prefers music that reflects his current personality and values. With only a couple of exceptions, Eric Clapton/Rock Guitar God retired after Layla. Thats just the way it is. Maybe he can't be a rock star without being a drunk and drug addict. So approach his new music for what it is. He's not going to rock, but that's  okay.   Much like Reptile, Back Home is another nice pop album with nice vocals and good playing. Not bad.
B000J0UD94|4.0|One of my fav films ever!! only disappointment: couldn't get it to play on my computer! Computer didn't even identify its presence in the drive! I guess it only plays in a detached DVD player!?
B003RD5WRI|4.0|I have seen Big Blue in original English uncut many times in my time in Germany. When I saw the US version in the US years later, I thought somebody butchered the movie. Original is Original, please don't mess with it. You people sometimes don't know what good is. It is perfect the way it is. Actually the original version was in English and the little boys at the beginning were speaking Italian.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|This is a wonderful little silicone case for my Verizon iPhone4.  I ordered it in black and it looks very nice on the phone.  It slides in and out of my pocket with ease, its light, and it provides a nice grip.  The fit is a little looser than I would have liked but I am not taking away any stars because it was only $4.03.  I recommend this product.  For the cost you can't find better.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Refreshed storyline with excellent graphic. Starts with easy ones and goes to larger stages. Well designed and a must have!
B0009U5DD0|5.0|This is a great album to listen to. I have heard their songs ever since I was a teen living in the UK. This mix is good for novices and regular Gypsy Kings listeners. I highly recommend it. The price of this CD (incl. S&H)was really reasonable too. Thanks!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a lot better than the old ones. It runs much smoother as well. I can't believe they made it so much better.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works perfect with great graphics on droid X on verizon !  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|This is by far, the best album they have released, not only putting their new 21st century songs on it they played some of their favorite songs like \\"When I come around\\" and \\"Good Riddance\\". Each and every song on this album is played at their 110%. Can't wait for their next album. I have complete confidence that it will be an even bigger hit!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I  don't believe any one would be that stupid to sign out off the amazon app store and then try and get past the drm check......then rate this app one star what a moron
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Plays flawlessly on my Samsung Intercept.  whatever you did to make it work, do that to your original game too!  keep up the great work.
B004P02OJ6|4.0|Russell Crowe has a definite style and it comes through in this movie.  Excellent from start to finish, it's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the screen,
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So much better than the original. They polished off the gameplay and runs flawlessly on my rooted Incredible. Keep up the good work rovio team.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|DtG has been consistently upgraded over he years, has always shown a high level of quality in product and diligence in customer service the scant few times I've needed assistance, and I use it daily to handle editing simple documents on the run and forwarding them. $15 is a steal, they used to charge considerably more in the heyday of PalmOS and it was worth the full price then.  I have been annoyed with working on spreadsheets on a small screen, but after trying other Office mobile programs I find no one has solved this problem and at least DtG does a good job of making it as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. I will say that it has been a lot easier since I no longer have to use Grafitti to enter formulas.  In short, high quality app, expect you'll get upgrades infrequently but consistently. Nothing glamorous about this workhorse of an app but highly reliable as a mobile work tool.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|wow....this time u go to Brazil and its in 3D!!! just amazing!!! and the game looks way better than on the iphone 4.<br /><br />Good work amazon and Rovio for making this happen...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am absolutely loving angry birds rio. It's definitely better than any of the previous versions of angry birds.   I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just as fun as angry birds free but with no ads and beautiful graphics.  Definitely a must have.  Will keep you entertained.  Very very very addicting!  Love it.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This is a fantastic CD release by the American blues guitar maestro/singer-songwriter Joe Bonamassa, titled 'Dust Bowl'. The wonderful lead guitar & vocals have a great blues rock sound on this CD : no surprise he was the recipient of 2010 Blues Artist award. My pickings for solid tracks/gems from this great CD include \\"Heartbreaker\\" (great blues rock lead guitar with a beautiful melody accompanied by great vocals & harmony), \\"No Love On The Street\\" (impressive guitar intro & wonderful melody) & \\"Prisoner\\" (a wonderful 'ballad' with great lead guitar & vocals). Remaining nine great tracks have varied versatility including \\"Tennessee Plates\\" (country/blues track), \\"Black Lung Heartache\\" (great slide guitar & Spanish guitar combination) & \\"The Last Matador Of Bayonne\\" (great 'ballad' with wonderful saxophone). On overall, this is a solid performance/CD release by the talented Joe Bonamassa. It's unbelievable that he has been releasing great material yearly since 2000, making him a prolific performer of note! A highly recommended CD listening.
0525951652|1.0|I read and enjoyed the previous two books.  The price of this one is way too high!  $20 for a e-book?  They are just plain greedy.  Sorry, will not be buying this one.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I got this for free but I would totally pay for this if i hadn't. It is super addictive and fun!! Runs very smooth and keeps your mind working
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The graphics is on this game are pretty good. Never had to deal with any lagging. But then I am playing on a Gtablet which has a dual core Nvidia Tegra processor. Great to keep you occupied when you are bored. One note of caution... it is very addictive.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Hard to review when it won't even install.  :(    I tried to install this many times and keep getting the following message on my phone, \\"Out of space, Angry Birds Rio could not be viewed. Free up some space on your phone and try again later.\\"    I deleted many apps and have more than enough room but still keep getting this message.    I have an HTC My Touch 3G Slide phone.    Update:    I unistalled Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons, tried the install again and now it installed.     I prefer the original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons though.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is more Angry Birds, and it is great! Love that there are secrets every few levels. It is very pretty, too. Definitely worth it on the Droid X.
0756404738|5.0|So far this series is nothing short of amazing.  Patrick Rothfuss is a great writer and I plan to buy the hardback version of the name of the wind (which I have the paperback of now) and he already has me sold on his final book in the series.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|graphically amazing. seems less challenging but the bird rescue concept is cool. highly irritating that amazon's app store HAS to be installed for the game to function.<br /><br />however: if you're a hermit who doesn't have an amazon account don't cry that it asks for your CC number. The number they have on file for me is an account closed over a year ago, they aren't actually using it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why send me an email telling me it's available. Then make me go through the rigmarole of configuring an account. Only to tell me it's not available in my region! I gave you my phone number. +44 = UK you Muppets!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I've never owned a dog (except when I was 2, but I don't remember her). I completely fell in love with Enzo. He made me laugh and cry. I read this book in 2 days. It was a suggestion from a co-worker who reads very similar books to me. Even knowing full well how it was going to end with Enzo, I still fell in love with him and couldn't wait to see what he was going to do next!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Man, now I wish I could buy the other versions without ads, they completely jack up the game.  Loving this version so far.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rio has the best graphics of them all so far... especially with the pinch and zoom. I love that there are so many levels... and so many more to come over the course of this year! Another success Rovio! -HTC EVO
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is the best angry birds yet. installed and plays just fine on evo4g.  no need to rate low because you cant install it on your phone
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is just as fun as the other Angry Birds games that first came out on Android, and being able to download it for free for a limited time without the annoying ads is not bad either. However, the game does slow down a lot on my OG Droid running on Android 2.3.2 after you've been playing for a while, then exits! Four stars until this is fixed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have watch this CD many times. I love it. I cry, and think it  is so wonderful that Hachi was picked up and taken home. What a   lesson for all of us. I love dogs or animal movies.To know that   it is a real stories. Many of us have had a wonderful dog,but  Hachi was special. Thanks for the CD.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|graphics look great. no adds like the other ones do.  Definitely satisfied so far.  Everyone should get this app. Tell your mom, dad, bro,sis, cousin, and girlfriend too...
B003UYV08E|5.0|Robert Downey Jr is so great in this I couldn't image anyone else more perfect for this role. Its a great movie I highly recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|35 meg free, but won't install. space error  every time. needs to be fixed. droid eris with android 2.1, and 35 meg free - what gives?
B002VPE1AW|2.0|This movie is very unoriginal. Its like that movie Pocahontas but with blue cats in it. It has cool graphics and the military tech stuff is cool. But I should of rented this instead of buying it.
B004L49K20|5.0|You will not have to ask this question for long because AYNIN will not go away as easily as their former efforts. It's just to good, and contains so many songs, that will endure the test of time. If you're tired of the current Top 40 then you will love this new Duran Duran CD.<br /><br />You must buy this CD!
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Joshua Foer is a writer for Slate. Back in 2005 he covered an obscure event for memory enthusiasts. From there he delved deeper into what memory is, how it works, what happens when it doesn't, as well as what happens when it works too well. In the process, he prepared for and a year later actually won the 2006 U.S. Memory championships, and went on to compete at the international level.     Foer writes in an engaging manner, and structures his book well. Moonwalking had my interest from the beginning, and held it all the way to the end: I finished it in four days, despite a hellish schedule.     Inside you'll find an interview with the real life Rain Man, the one Dustin Hoffman's character was based on. You'll meet a man who could remember 1950, but nothing after that, including that you had a conversation with him five minutes ago.     Joshua also describes in great detail the tricks he used and the regimen he stuck by to compete (and win) in the U.S. Memory Championship of 2006. You'll also learn the history behind the use of memory in ancient times, up until the Renaissance, why it works the way it does, and what our memories aren't so good at.     I recommend this book to anyone even remotely curious about how the mind works, and why they forget where they put their car keys.     For deeper (and thus drier) study, please see The Art of Memory, by Frances Yates.     Trivia: the author used an image of himself moonwalking with Einstein to remember the combination of cards I used as the title for this review.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|These are like sooo sweet.. I love how LONG the cord is!! I love to wrap it around my nude body while I play games. I play mostly FPS's in the nude and scream my favorite song into the mic just to let people know I am versed in that genre of music. People love me so much for it. I have like 400 friends on my PS3.. You should totally buy it. I've tried many other brands but none have a cord quite long enough for me. I like them long what can I say?     P.S. add me if you like my comment. PSN TOA_Doublevision
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great app for viewing pdfs on the go. I gave it 4 stars because it could use zoom. other than that it serves its purpose. UPDATE: has zoom capabilities now, I use it on my Android tablet a lot.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's an excellent update to an already great game. Better graphics, a new goal (not just killing more pigs), and improved UI make this a win.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|why allow people in uk to download amazon app but then cant buy anythin from it? ?when will we b able to use it? ??
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|If you are a Green Day fan, this album is a must have! Their live performances just keep getting better and better.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|This dvd is a LOT more than I expected! The holographic cover that comes with it is really neat, and once you have the dvd playing, the visuals are VERY surreal before you reach the main screen. I love it! I like how deleted scenes are added into the movie, and there's a BUNCH of extras! VERY worth what I paid for it and more!
B0041KKYD8|3.0|If your interested in this movie then I'm guessing your not looking for a movie with and Oscar worthy story, of stellar acting.  I've seen both the original and the sequel.  The original movie was about the 3 rapes that take place and how brutal and degrading they were.  The revenge for the rapes was an afterthought for the script-writters because the way the revenge killings take place makes so scence what so ever.  Would you expected a woman you rapped to offer to take a bath with you?  The sequel has two rape seqeunces, which are also brutal and degrading, but after the rapes takes place the revenge killings are geared toward killing the rapeists in the same way that they partisipated in the rapes.  SPOILER ALERT...I will now reveal how one of the murders takes place.  Durring the rape, one of the hillbillies is always using his camera to film what is going on.  To exact her revenge on this individual, the victim/murderer first knocks the rapeist out.  When he awakens, he finds himself duct taped to a tree.  At this point, she takes his camcorder and turns the screen around so that he can see him self because \\"he likes to watch\\", now that he can see himself she uses fish-hooks to attach his eye-lids to eye-brows so that he can not blink and has no choice but to watch himself on the camcorder screen.  She then guts a fish and smears the innards all over the hillbillies clothes and face.  The hillbilliy dies when blackbirds show up and start eating the fish innards and in the process pull out the hillbillies eyes.<br /><br />What makes the sequel better than the original is the inventive nature of how the victim kills her rapists.  In my opionion the final killing is probably the most inventive because it is a 2 for 1 killing (two rapists killed simoltaniously).  I won't ruin it for you but here's a hint of how it happens.  One of the two people who die in the final death scence is the rapist who sodomized the victim and if he had kept his mouth shut the second rapist may not have gotten killed.  You'll know what a funny statement that is when you see the movie.rapist may not have gotten killed.  You'll know what a funny statement that is when you see the movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The graphics are significantly enhanced.  Game play is still smooth and maybe even better than previous versions on my Evo 4G.   Now I have many more levels to feed my addiction.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I will gladly pay 99.cents to have no ads.  Wouldn't you?I will gladly pay 99.cents to have no ads.  Wouldn't you?  I will gladly pay 99.cents to have no ads.  Wouldn't you?
B004KD5TQI|3.0|As far as soundtracks go this is ok, it's not the best and there are better ones out there. Taking some old songs and having various cast members sing them is a good idea as while not a fan of Emily Browning( sadly besides one more there's two other songs that are just boring ) I was set to hate her version of Sweet Dreams but I found it to be a good cover of the song, same goes for Emiliana Torrini with White Rabbit and Carlo Gugino & Oscar Isaac with Love Is The Drug.<br /><br />The mash-up of former Terror Squad member Armageddon and Queen may have sounded good on paper but just winds up  sounding like a train wreck, there's always a 50/50 chance when dealing with a mash up that the person knows what they're doing but it's mainly a fail most of the time. The Bjork remix was great and could have been used for a trailer as well as Search & Destroy by Skunk Anansie as both get you pumped for whatever you're doing, other then those there's not much to this soundtrack as there's only 9 songs on it.<br /><br />It could have been better served to add on the score as the rest of the disc or just add it on as it's own separate disc as for thirteen bucks this is way too much for six good songs with two bad ones and one that should have been left the chopping block
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a great update to the original game! the higher quality sound and graphics make it an absolute blast to play. :) all you one star reviewers are just trolls.
B00006FM77|5.0|Been a big Chicago fan for many years. Don't know why I didn't get this recording 40 years ago. Remastered cuts are great. Seraphine really cooks on the cuts. Heard this tour in Harrisburg, PA, Farm Show in 1971.
B001676320|5.0|Actually saw this tour in Hershey, PA, summer of 2004. Good to have finally purchased this Blu-ray to remember how good this concert was. If you don't have it, get it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|wil not install on htc incredible. please fix this problem asap for a higher star rating. disappointed with  amazon for letting this happen with such a popular app
B004SBS8LA|1.0|better interface than the original version! can not wait for the next update!  already passed all the levels!! awesome awesome awesome! ! keep up the great work!
1439102724|4.0|again! I could have cut and pasted the review of the last of her books I read.    She has taken another topical controversial subject, added characters and set them up as being on one side or the other, and let the big court battle shake itself out. Can't forget the memorable supporting cast, and the \\"twist\\" that Jodi always manages to toss in near the end. Did I mention the different fonts for different characters' points of view?    Some of the characters, okay, most of the characters are pretty predictable and act exactly the way one would expect them to. Some of the dialogue seems uninspired, that is, you expect them to say exactly what Jodi has them saying.    Jodi still manages to throw in the OMG! moments that took me by surprise. Of course, some of the plot I could see coming from a hundred pages away.    So why the four stars (four and a half if I had that option)? Because Jodi does it so well. I stayed up way too late reading this book (like I usually do with her books) just to find out what would happen next. Her books are always entertaining and thought-provoking.    Although Jodi isn't the first author I have read that frames the parts of the books with songs (that distinction goes to Margaret Atwood and _The Year of the Flood_), she is the first (to my knowledge) to include a CD of original songs that are supposed to explain the characters' moods at the various parts of the story. It's a nice touch but didn't really add much to the book itself.    Devoted fans of Jodi's work know what they like. They will not be disappointed by this one, nor will most other readers. But I am still waiting to be blown away.
B004FGMV0W|2.0|I had high hopes for \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\", unfortunately it falls short.  If you are buying this based on the single \\"What the Hell\\", you will not be happy. Everything else is \\"ballad-y\\", but not particularity memorable.  The majority of the CD sounds like one long album track with a few standouts, but even the standouts are just marginally catchy.  I had hoped Butch Walker could save this after the overly commercial mess that was \\"The Best Damn Thing\\".  It didn't happen.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I got hooked on the original and the seasons version.  Now it's RIO and I love the challenge of getting the awards.  It would be great if they allowed you to choose which bird you get to use!
B000X107GI|5.0|These arrived quickly as pictured, in a small photo mailer, with a list of what type of cells and how many where in the package printed on the back.  I'm not sure about that from a security standpoint (though I don't guess too many people steal coin cells out of the mail), but it was useful as I ordered several different things from this same vendor.  It made it easy to see what had arrived and when.
0525423273|5.0|There are very few novels that I have liked so much that after I have read them once I had to reopen the book and start reading it all over again. This was one of those novels. Stephanie Perkins brings a charming humor and beautiful landscape to Anna and the French Kiss. There was never one moment when I didn't feel the cobblestone streets beneath Anna's feet or the scent of decadent coffee floating in the air. Anna is a clever character, she is not only a realistic embodiment of your average seventeen-year-old, but also has ambition and strength. St. Clair is super hot, hilarious, and at times a little lost. Exactly how we want our men to be. There were moments in this novel that had me laughing out lout as well as moments that got me a little teary eyed.     Anna wanting to be a film critic was a new twist that I have not seen before in any other novels. There were references to many films and directors that I LOVE! Short descriptions of directors such as Wes Andersen and Sofia Coppola were just exciting for me because those are the makers of some of my favorite films. I was so happy that Anna was in her Paris dorm room watching Rushmore, I thought, \\"that Stephanie Perkins is freaking awesome!\\" This novel has a little bit of everything: romance, friendship, humor, and a little heartache just for good measure. READ IT! You will love it. Congrats to Perkins for writing an amazing debut novel! I tip my beret to you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful!  It has allowed me to read the Bible more frequently tha I had before with my hardcopy Bible. I'm able to read my Bible before bed and in the morning before I start my day. It has many versions (NIV, NKJ, AMP, Message, etc) of the Bible and different language translations, so there's something for everyone.  It's easy to switch from one version to another to experience God's Word in a unique and enriching way. This app allows me to copy and paste verses for later study. The app also has dozens and dozens of Bible reading plans and devotionals that will help you understand the Word.  I love being able to re-focus my thoughts when I wake up in the middle of the night, or while waiting for appointments.  Part of being a successful Christian is reading God's Word, and this app will help every reader from the newbie to the more mature Christian. You get to choose how you want to read the Word.
B000002KHH|5.0|Paranoid was one of my first heavy metal albums, as I got it and Master of Reality on vinyl at a flea market when I was in 5th grade.  My older cousins were into Sabbath, solo Ozzy, Quiet Riot, Dio, etc., so I had to try to be cool like them.  Well, it turns out they didn't steer me wrong.<br /><br />What can I say about Paranoid?  It's one of the most acclaimed albums in heavy metal/hard rock history because it has classic, timeless songs that never get old.  I've listened to the original Iron Man, oh, I don't know, maybe ten thousand times, and I could listen to it ten thousand more with no trace of boredom or indifference.  Besides the other historic songs like War Pigs, the song Paranoid, and Fairies Wear Boots, this album offers plenty more great music.  It has Planet Caravan, a mellow, moving, trippy psychedelic excursion.  Electric Funeral, the ultra-heavy precursor to both doom metal and speed metal.  Hand of Doom, featuring Iommi's dynamic songwriting and the startling contrast of cool, jazzy verses giving way to thundering heavy metal.  And finally, the unforgettable Rat Salad, which is my favorite Sabbath instrumental piece.  Not much reason not to love Paranoid.<br /><br />I don't want to leave out the unique, distinct, buzz that is Geezer Butler's bass sound, and Bill Ward's versatile, unconventional drum patterns.  Add these elements to Ozzy's first truly confident vocal performance and you have one of the greatest releases in music history.  Definitely no sophomore slump here for the budding superstars and future legends.
B003VANOFY|5.0|We love this headset!  It adjusts easily and fits comfortably. Great sound and range.  I would purchase this again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|angry birds Rio is a great improvement over the original. love the new artwork and the music is good too. This is a must have game for Android.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I should say that I loved the first five Camp Half-Blood books and was thrilled when I found out that we would be coming back to follow new Heroes. I was not disappointed! Even as a kid I was fascinated by all types of mythology so the inclusion of \\"new\\" Gods in this book made me extremely excited. The new Big Bad the heroes have to fight is also a really cool addition. I can't wait to read the next book to see what goes on with Percy in the other camp! (No seriously, when is it coming out? I'm kind of obsessed!)
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|THis was an absolutely terrible movie! The plot goes no where and the ending is completely unsatisying. I am a huge Matt Damon fan and this movie does not do him justice and he is barely in it in the first place!. A third of the movie is in French so I hope you are ready to read subtitles. The concept of the movie is great but they do not do enough with it. The best story line is definitely the small boy's. THis movie was absolutely not what I was expecting it to be and I would not suggest it to anyone. Do not waste your time or money.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|This is a sweet and humane film.  Like a love letter.  I've had two near death experiences.  One in 1989 and another in 1993.  Clint Eastwood got it right.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The app won't install on my Droid X. I tried 5 times, unmounted the SD card.  I finally got updates for Angry Birds Seasons though.  I would rather download it through the app store than amazon.  I'll wait until they get the install issue fixed and then check the app store on my phone and download it when it gets there.  I love amazon but not for my apps. Just my $.02.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|after reading only exclusive to amazon app store which doesn't run in UK I got it from another source free after looking about for a while so dunno why just US officially gets amazon app store
B004S8NBDI|4.0|While not quite an instant classic, Angles could become the most popular The Strokes album. It has more variety and is as catchy as anything they have done. I do miss a bit of their earlier day angst and punk attitude, but some of it is still there and the rest they  make up for by being adventurous and exploring new sounds while still keeping that special Strokes sound. Angles does not have a bad song on it. It is not perfect, as some songs sound like a mixture of different parts, lacking a well-written lyrical focus, but it is always interesting and often great. Perhaps the most exciting part of about Angles is that is sounds like a band expanding their sound before our eyes - it makes you wonder what kind of awesome albums they are capable of in the future. Remember, The Strokes did in the 2000's for rock what Nirvana did in the 90's (they didn't initially achieve the commercial success that Nirvana did due to their un-commercial Velvet Underground aspirations). The best could be still to come, but for now Angles will do - it's the album to beat in 2011.    Best songs: Under Cover of Darkness, Life is Simple in the Moonlight, Two Kinds of Happiness, Taken for a Fool, Machu Piccu, Gratisfaction.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Original Angry Birds start off easy to learn the control and strategy in playing the game.  Angry Birds Seasons is much harder if you haven't have any experience in playing this kind of game.  Now they have the Angry Birds Rio, I am glad they brought back the easyiness for beginners.  The game is a breeze to play.  Hopefully they will have more challenging levels soon.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Enjoyed this game very much. Short, with a couple of minor stumpers. Definitely worth the cost. Hoping for a sequel.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|As a fan of Let the Right One In, I was apprehensive when I heard that the film was being adapted for the U.S.  I figured that it would be dumbed down and gored up.  Instead, this version comes really close to capturing the mood and suspense of the original film.  If you're reading this, you probably know the basics of the story.  I didn't notice any serious alterations in the adaptation aside from the \\"narrative frame\\" involving the burn victim/caretaker in the U.S. version.  Sure, there were some minor changes from point to point (no cat attack on the female victim as she's transforming, etc.), but they don't affect the depth of the core story about Owen and Abby.<br /><br />In any event, this DVD is a good transfer of the film.  It's well worth checking it out, and it beats the pants off of more recent \\"sparkly\\" vampire films.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|I have this on my Palm Pre. It is an excellent value. I am most impressed with this developer. I recommend it to any and all.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game has the Best graphics  out of all other versions of the game so far. Cute birds and vibrant  colors make this my personal favorite.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app to help you stay organized.  I use it for research, shopping and reminders.  it syncs to the app for my Mac, which is very convenient.

B000MD9UJC|3.0|Works fine, does what it says it will do. Convert your mini-mag lights to LED but it's not as bright as a $3.00 new LED. Convert your mag lights as opposed to throwing them away? Easily twice as bright as the mag light was but only half as brigt as the small new LED I carry that I bought in a 3 Pak at costco for $18
630463949X|5.0|What is not to like, this is great Fleetwood Mac and the USC Marching Band adds a lot to the finally.
B0034G4OY0|1.0|this movie is boring boring boring.  it begins with a tsunami and goes no where.  it is like watching paint dry. it is so bad i think i will use the blu-ray as a coaster.
0316017922|4.0|Long story short:<br /><br />Gladwell dispels the myth that people become successful solely based on \\"hard work and sweat\\" and instead argues that people often become successful because of the way society is designed, strokes of luck, timing, AND of course hard work and sweat.<br /><br />The author presents numerous examples, ranging from lawyers to hockey players, defending the logic of his argument. The examples are interesting, but I felt that as the book went on he just continued to argue the same point over and over again and the book dragged in the last 1/4. It's a convincing argument sure, but I felt he could've easily omitted a chapter or two without hurting the book.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, and it will raise questions about the circumstances of your own life and how it inevitably affects the outcome (though don't expect that you'll go from chump to champ overnight thanks to the book).<br /><br />4/5 stars
B003Y5H55G|5.0|I'm a big Simon Pegg fan, ever since Shaun of the Dead & Hot Fuzz. Not to mention Star Trek (2009 film). This movie had me laughing the whole way through. It was brilliantly written (no surprise) with a ton of great subtle and not-so-subtle gag references to classic iconic movies/shows like Jaws, Aliens, Close Encounters and Star Trek. Not to mention brilliant acting from Pegg, Frost and Rogen. Possibly Pegg's best writing since Shaun of the Dead.    If you're a sci-fi geek/nerd/dork/whatever and can laugh at yourself as such, you'll have a great time. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just trying to come up with a word to describe how fantastic and fun this is to play on my EVO 4g! I should be getting some work done, but&hellip;
B004GYY714|5.0|I have tried many radio apps for my Droid by far this is the best. Radiotime is also on my HDTV so I share my presets. Hope to get it on my table internet radio.
0671835467|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It's more of the same but with slightly better graphics and a changed premise. A good way to get more of your angry bird fix if you've finished the original and seasons. EVO
1400052173|4.0|Read this book not for the strong writing (it's readable writing but not great writing) nor for the lovable, upbeat characters (this is a story of a family in constant struggle.)  Read this book for a great narrative about medicine, race, research and ethics.    This is the second book I have read about research on human cells, the first being Michael Crichton's NEXT.  I don't know the right answer, but these books are raising the right questions.      Henrietta Lacks was a poor black cancer patient at Johns Hopkins in the fifties.  Cell culture was in its infancy when samples of her tumor were removed for study.  Her cells, for reasons barely understood even today, survived in the lab and grew quickly, making them perfect for many different types of cell research.    Henrietta's cells, named HeLa, are famous, but her family never knew until late in the game.  This book is about their attempts to educate themselves and to understand what had happened to their mother and their family.    The author also introduces us to a wide range of medical experimentation that was done on black patients over the years, which provides a context for why Henrietta's family might not embrace medical research in a positive way.    It's a compelling story, thoughtfully and carefully told.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I think it is completely rediculous to have to give amazon my credit card number to download this app.  People are saying to rate the app and not the app store but the app makers and amazon are responsible for this horrible launch.  Rating a 1 and getting rid of my amazon app store

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Ordered Eighth Season of 24, bought all others at local stores but decided to go on-line to check out availability and price, glad I did not only did I receive order very quickly the price was 40% cheaper than local store price. Very happy all DVD's worked flawlessly and will order from Amazing Dealz in the future. If I could give them a six instead of a five I would, thanks.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I rushed to download this while it was free for one day only..two days later it is still free. Not to happy about that amazon. The 3* is for amazon's market
1563894696|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this book is great.  I just felt like it dragged on for a LONG time.  Fun story that keeps you guessing throughout, but when I was about 3/4 though, I thought it started to drag.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game totally UPS the ante from its previous iterations! took the original concept and  really made it shine. it needs a replay feature for bragging rights.

142311339X|5.0|I enjoyed the book. cant wait till next one comes out. it starts out on a field trip bus Jason doesnt remember who he is and who everyone else is. but he thinks he dosent belong. the monsters show up and he and his two friends go on a quest. Percey jackson has disapeared. talks a lot about greek and roman gods the differences. its an action fun book highly recommend it. some favorite characters show up again.
1401200605|5.0|They have Hush Vol's 1 and 2 together in one story.  Unless you're a collector and want them separate, save your money and just buy the full story in one book.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|With 893 reviews already written, one might imagine that everything that could possibly be said about this book (Patrick Rothfuss's \\"The Name of the Wind) has been said and nothing more could be said.  The fact that so many people felt compelled to write a review, including myself, also tells you that this book has had a substantial impact on almost everybody who read it.  Many people have already commented on what a great story-teller Rothfuss is.  Fewer commented on the compelling world of magic, poverty, and music presented in the book.  I will focus on these three subjects.      In Rothfuss' world, magic obey laws that are similar to those that govern thermodynamics.  The first law states that energy is conserved.  Indeed, energy must come from somewhere and Rothfuss took great pains to illustrate this.  It was of of course convenient that the story was set at a University where professors teach young people the principles of magic.  The concept of \\"sympathy\\" and attaching objects to each other is not just interesting but ingenious.  Likewise, the attempt to explain the importance of naming of the wind, the title of the book, was remarkably well done.        Probably the most consistent and best-described situation in the First book was the poverty of the protagonist.  The description of the hunger, the desperation, and the fear that extreme poverty brings is so real that it seems likely the author himself must have been poor at one point.  The crueity of people towards each other, particularly the destitute, was described in devastating detail.  He truly understands how much a little bit of money is worth when one is hungry or really wants something that only money can buy.  Yet, at the same time, Ruthfuss understands that money isn't everything.    Finally, I imagine that Rothfuss is an accomplished lute player, or at least a guitar player.  Nobody who is not a player can understand or describe so vividly what it means to perform with closed eyes and the feelings that it evokes in the player.  The view was not from the outside but from the inside of the player.  He understands the hunger for the instrument, the feeling of having lost of damaged it.  In almost every scene, music was part of the book and the emotional makeup of the book.      At first I was puzzled by why some people felt so strongly negative about the book.  Most of the reactions were not boredom but strong dislike.  It seems that the book aroused strong feelings in readers.  Over 80% liked it very much and many said that it was amongst the best books that they have ever read.  But, 5-10% felt very strongly that the book was terrible.  It is hard to imagine why except that the book seemed to rub these people the wrong way.  But, after having finished reading the book, it became clear that it may be the character.  You either loved or strongly disliked the main character.      Wise.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|\\"Unstoppable\\" is a heart-pounding action flick that reminds me a lot of 1999's superb \\"Speed\\", with its cast of ordinary citizens and an ordinary vehicle hurtling toward destruction. At Fuller Yard in Northern Pennsylvania, the 39-car train 777 gets away from its operator when he abandons the cabin to fix a switch. Meanwhile, at Brewster Yard in Southern Pennsylvania, veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and novice conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) don't quite hit it off. They're heading toward Stanton in train 1206. When it is discovered that 777 is not coasting but is under power and picking up speed, carrying a load of molten phenol and diesel fuel, the Fuller yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) clashes with her company's VP Oscar Gavin (Kevin Dunn) on how to cope with the crisis.<br /><br />The day begins slowly, as people go about their jobs on the railroad. It takes everyone a while to grasp the extent of the problem. The audience gets to know them. The film's title sequence claims it was \\"inspired by true events\\", a reference to a 2001 train mishap in Ohio involving a runaway train carrying molten phenol. It wasn't nearly so hair-raising in real life, but the element of near-plausibility makes \\"Unstoppable\\" more compelling. It's a race against time, not against high-tech gadgetry. The train must be stopped before it reaches a curve in Stanton, which will cause it to derail and spew toxic chemicals. The technology that can be brought to bear on the problem is limited. It's a railroad. So this is an old-fashioned action movie, punched up with some doom and gloom and the occasional explosion, but thoroughly enjoyable.
0767817478|5.0|I thought this movie was great!    The first thing I noticed about it, was that it didn't take itself too seriously - which allowed it to explore certain avenues that would otherwise have been \\"off limits\\" for a pure \\"monster movie.\\"  It delivers on understated comedy relief thanks to Matthew Broderick and there is a scene that is reminiscent of the original Jaws movie and one that is reminiscent of Jurassic Park - but plenty of original material as well.  Godzilla also delivers on suspense and of course - that old movie \\"stand by\\" of - \\"just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water ...\\" (or take a sigh of relief ...) you get hit with the next higher level of tension and suspense!    I don't like to write \\"spoiler\\" type reviews, but I will say that 2/3 of the way through the movie there is a dramatic switch to a much more serious suspense/horror tone which is very effective and believable, and you've been thinking of this eventuality from early on in the movie anyway.    It was originally a 3D movie and the DVD version that I bought also included a pair of 3D glasses, but I couldn't quite get the 3D glasses to work with my regular glasses, so I watched it without the 3D glasses and I don't think I lost any of the impact except that I could tell when something was supposed to look like it just jumped out of the screen at you.    Since I bought it, I've watched Godzilla once by myself, once with my wife and once with the Commentary on - and I'm not tired of it yet, so I highly recommend this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked and could not stop clicking pages (poor Kindle joke) from the very first page. This a great next step for the Harry Potter generation and one that should be taken. I would never feel comfortable recommending something like Twilight to anyone but this coming of age story fits right in there with Catcher in the Rye. It teaches the brutality of war.<br /><br />I don't know that I would want someone in middle school reading this but would definitely recommend it to someone in high school or higher.<br /><br />From the first page I was reminded of the dystopian future set forth by 1984 - 1984 is one of my favorites. I can't sing any higher praise for this book other than recommending that you start reading this as soon as possible - at any age.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is very interesting. i like  it. it's small but very good. what's more, it's free.quite cool. both on android and ios. the android version is better because i have a brighter screen which make the game experience much better.
1591843790|5.0|Kawasaki has a great arc to this book that encompasses old-fashioned techniques of influence (your crows-feet; how to shake hands) and moves all the way to easily to implement ideas on pushing your message with modern technology (his how-to use Twitter has been a favorite of mine since I started using in 2008). Almost every page will have you saying out loud, \\"right, right\\" as he gently programs your social behaviors and message for modern times.
0891349553|5.0|Katherine Dewey is an amazing artist that is extremely talented; her book makes me want to start straight away, although I have been too busy recently.   Katherine's figures may look simple to follow, but this shows years of practise and her love of clay. A must have book, to encourage those who already can, to get back into sculpting and to those who can't, it gives lots of advice, diagrams and pictures. For example to show how to sculpt a dog she uses 10 pages for the Basset Hound and 10 more pages for the Red Fox. She gives money saving tips on making tools that work and how to make a cheap armature that saves on using too much clay and also keeps the work a lot lighter in weight.  Thankyou Katherine Dewey you have made a new fan. I will always keep an eye out for any new book you present :)
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Beautifully written story, characters are genuine, well developed, and the pull of the beautiful India of contrasts is authentically felt. What a beautiful debut, I look forward to reading this author's future works!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I can't get this to download onto my HTC Droid Eris. It keeps telling me there is not enough memory. Even after deleting a 40MB file from my phone, it still won't let me download. This file is only supposed to take up 12.5MB or so. I give up with it. Good thing it was free or I would really have been mad.
B000JU7NCE|4.0|This is a great video concert.  I loved the fact that they played some of ther songs from the early days.  Songs that at one time, they had vowed never to play again.  At times the cameraman got a bit funky with the video, panning in and out, or unfocusing the lense, or adding a 3D lighting scheme.  This became an annoyance but the music was GOOD!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on my Droid X. Downloaded 7 times and it wont work. frustrating, dont bother with it. Really dont need 25 words to get this point across.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|I own a Panasonic BD-605 blu-ray player. I got Alien Anthology as a Christmas gift and am just now playing the discs...and they won't play. I put in \\"Aliens\\" and it played fine for about an hour, but then froze up. I ejected the disc and put it back in and now the player won't read it at all. It also won't read the \\"Alien\\" disc and froze up on the special features disc. Haven't tried playing \\"Alien 3\\" or \\"Alien Resurrection\\" discs yet. But \\"Aliens\\" and the special edition disc played fine on the blu-ray player on my Sony Vaio laptop (although it takes a LONG time for the Joss Whedon script on the special edition disc to load; and it wouldn't load at all on the Panasonic). I took to the net and found a forum where a lot of people have had problems playing these discs.     All that being said, what I have been able to see looks great and the features are really interesting. So, buyer beware - this is a great set...but you might not be able to get it to play :(
B004SBS8LA|5.0|why is everyone complaining this was a marketing campaign that worked! just get the appstore and sign in and download and as for the game still genius as before addictive beyond belief
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Simple game, damn near everyone has it or has heard of it, and there's a reason for it.  Very fun.
B0000A1HQP|4.0|I don't speak French.  It is true that much is lost in<br />translation, especially for a movie like this.  In spite<br />of this fact, I still liked this movie a lot.<br /><br />The movie is super funny due to situations that the<br />characters find themselves in.  Especially when the tax<br />collector visits Pierre at his home.  But even the<br />basic plot line of finding the most idiotic person to<br />win a competetion is very funny.  I will always be<br />suspicious of people inviting me into a dinner party<br />after watching this movie. :)<br /><br />But beware, it is different then american comedy movies<br />and it may not agree with your sense of humour.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|As you would expect, it's more of the game everyone already knows.  The graphics seem a little better, finally having an ad free angry birds is really wonderful.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|Send your children to bed, and enjoy the show.  Julianne<br />Moore is superb in portraying a wife who is in doubt if<br />her husband is cheating on her.<br /><br />Then she decides to test him by hiring an escort Chloe (Amanda<br />Seyfried) to see if he will be tempted.  Very bad idea!<br />I don't know a single man on earth who will not be tempted<br />by her.  When the wife finds out, the only thing he needs to say is<br />\\"but honey, just look at her!\\", case closed. :)<br /><br />But that is not how things turn out.  What is happening here<br />is that Chloe is lonely and wants a mother figure in her life.<br />The only way she can relate to people is through sex.  So<br />Chloe tries to make a connection to Catherine through sex,<br />foregoing financial aspects of the relationship.<br /><br />What Catherine should have done is instead of paying Chloe<br />individually for the husband and for herself, she should<br />have negotiated a discount based on couple rates.  Benefits<br />are clear: at least 50% less money goes out, double the<br />pleasure comes in.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is already one of my favorites.  This is the<br />first time I saw Amanda Seyfried in a movie, and she will be added<br />to my list of favorites.<br /><br />Highly recommended, if you are not bothered by a little bit<br />of nudity here and there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed quickly and instantly on my LG Optimus T.  This is a very nice update from the original.  The graphics seem much improved.  Lost of fun.  No complaints so far.<br /><br />ETA : some of the later levels are a bit laggy at times, but I blame my relatively weak phone and not the game.  It's in no way unplayable though.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|After following the fix posted here to connect the phone to a pc and deleting the smdl2tmpl.asec file. DO NOT delete the entire folder, you will lose apps

B004SBS8LA|1.0|i turned my phone off cause it was almost dead and i turned it back on and i cant find it. and i push open on here and it won't open. please update so i can play.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great game, grahics, and story line. Only complaint so far is that the monkeys appear to be humping. Otherwise, love it and enjoy playing! Hope everyone finds it as fun as I do. I'm looking forward to more levels.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm impressed at how Rovio took this game in a new direction. Definitely worth playing if you liked the other games. The layered scrolling is a nice touch to the graphics, too.
B004L49K20|4.0|Love this album.  It does so remind me of the old DD but with a new pop twist.  Cannot give it enough RAVE....Just Adore It..Thanks so much for giving us more.  Hope it is not the last.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|that's all. I just want the original trilogy without all the CGI garbage. Lucas can retire the special editions, because no one but him enjoys them.
B00008977N|3.0|I ordered this for a friend. She reimbursed me. At this point I'm unsure whether the disc is defective or  incompatible with her older DVD player, but she called on Monday the 21'st of March, 2011 and informed me.  I may end up trying to return it. She said she'd test it on my DVD player before she would ask me to do that.  Because of the confusion, I can only give a potential notice of return and an OK rating.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Device: Nexus S  No problems running the app same old angry birds just updated visual. I haven't seen any new features yet. Still fun and I like not having the ads.
0439023521|5.0|I was not a fan of futuristic books or any sort of science fiction until i read this series.  But once I started i couldn't stop! It was so captivating in both the writing and escpecially in the character developement.  This book is advertised to young adults, but it is far more complex and graffic at times than to be restricted to a younger audience.  I read all three books in a week and was so sad when I no longer had these characters' stories to read.  Katniss and her tale are totally relatable for anyone who has had to live through the trials of love and family.  Although the story is futuristic and science fiction based, the story is so modern and grounded in such relatable human emotions, that you feel like the hunger games may actually happen.  It is such a wonderful series!
B004K192DG|5.0|A wonderful story of the strength, endurance and survival of the amazing people who grew up in the Brooklyn NY \\"projects\\" in the early twentieth century.  It seems to me to be the author's autobiography.  Before I read this book, I thought the only poor people lived on small farms in the Deep South. Don't miss it.  This book is a lesson in survival that will make you a better person.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|My son bought these to use with his xbox.  He really likes that the headphones are comfortable and completely cover his ears.  His old set did not and put pressure on his ears.

And yet...this book may be arf-full, but it's also awful. Portentious and pretentious prose, with ponderous Life Lessons. Worse still, it, in tandem with Marley and Me, unleashed a bone-chilling tide of bad canine books. Get out the pooper scooper! Like a car in a racetrack, like a dog chasing its tail, this story goes nowhere.

038532653X|4.0|Not to be a wiseguy, but sometimes overly effusive, dramatic, \\"life changing\\" reviews can steer you away from a book, especially if it's about angels.<br />  Well, that's not a concern here. Skellig could be an angel, or a hobo; it doesn't really matter.  The book is a wonderful meditation on youth, family and friendship. Written with restraint, it could be a very good introduction for a young reader to \\"fine writing\\". It's certainly better than most of the schlocky inspirational fiction currently on the adult best seller lists.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Finished it in first day of release. Then next day got the three stars on all Rio levels. So for me easier then the last release of angry birds seasons. But can not complain about the graphics, they are great looking. Sound is good as well. Wish there were more levels but I guess I just need to wait until May. Running on a nook color, with cm7mod. Btw, angry birds looks and works fantastic on tablets with a capacitive screen.

0451169514|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I find almost all Stephen King books very entertaining and readable. Believability is a different matter, however.<br /><br />I tend to divide Stephen King books into the \\"Supernatural\\" and the \\"Non-Supernatural.\\" As for the Non-Supernatural, my favorites are Misery and On Writing, and the short story/novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. Stephen King's Supernatural books, the ones that contain some supernatural element central to the plot, generally leave me wanting more. Too often for me the supernatural comes in as a \\"deus ex machina\\" (Latin for \\"God out of the machine,\\" a plot device where a very difficult problem is suddenly solved with the contrived intervention of some new event, ability, or supernatural phenomenon). Although The Stand is a good read, the end of that book is a good example of deus ex machina. Not so with It.<br /><br />Stephen King's It is completely engrossing, genuinely scary, and very endearing believe it or not. The central characters are a group of self-proclaimed \\"losers\\" who don't fit in with the other kids in school. They naturally gravitate towards one another and become a very tight group of friends in the small town of Derry Maine during a seemingly everlasting summer in the 1950's. They make the swampy bottom area of town called the Barrens their personal clubhouse, and each of their unique talents and family backgrounds come into play.<br /><br />Derry is cursed by a being they call \\"It,\\" which has inhabited the town for hundreds of years. It appears to each person as the sum of their own worst fears, forcing them to face their own demons in turn. The story goes back and forth between the group in the 1950's as children and the group in present day as grownups, gathered back in Derry to face It again after it resurfaces 28 years later and resumes abducting and killing children.<br /><br />The genius of Stephen King in It is how he sees things most of us take for granted - the drains in our bathroom, the sewer system, abandoned buildings in town, etc. - and turns them into a vast underworld where evil exists right under our very noses without us knowing a thing about it until it is (almost?) too late.<br /><br />The chemistry of the central characters of the book as children and then again as adults is flawless. They reminded me of the characters in Stephen King's Stand By Me (the movie version of his terrific novella The Body from his collection Different Seasons), only these characters are much more fleshed out and are even more engrossing. You will find yourself desperately wanting to be a member of the gang and hanging out with them in the Barrens all summer long.<br /><br />Stephen King's It is absolutely terrific. Do not be put off by its length - trust Stephen King as a master storyteller here. Pick it up and read 1-2 chapters a night, and it will sweep you along faster and faster like a mounting hurricane. By the end you will be yearning for more. Highly recommended.bandoned buildings in town, etc. - and turns them into a vast underworld where evil exists right under our very noses without us knowing a thing about it until it is (almost?) too late.

B0002EXH5E|4.0|This album is a good one. Its not a masterpiece , but a good album that i like. It has something songs that sound like a mix of pop metal cool scene. This is the most experiment album they have ever released. Its not classic at all - that the reason that classic fans will have their negative reviews. Well i like very much Megadeth but i dont care if an album is classic or not by the sound of the group. I only care about how good is really the album. This is an album that if you are open - minded , you will like.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|it is 1954. A seasick man, Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) with his new partner Chuck Avle (Mark Ruffalo) are on a ferry to Boston Harbor islands. They are on their way to Shutter Island where a mental hospital for the criminally insane are held. The patients are dangerous. There is only one way in and one way out. Only one dock. At the gate of the institution, Deputy Marshall McPherson (John Carroll Lynch) tells them they are not allowed to have their firearms.    Inside they are met by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). He proceeds to tell them that Rachel Solando is missing. The door to her room is kept locked.    Her story is, she killed her three children in the lake behind her house and then sat them at the kitchen table and ate a meal. She still thinks her children are alive.    Daniels and Avle begin their investigation.    Also in the cast: Michelle Williams, Max Von Sydow, Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, Matthew Cowles.    Option of Audio and Subtitles in English, French, Spanish.      I was hoping for a good film noir-mystery film, but this movie is all messed up.  The name \\"Martin Scorsese\\" should have told me something. [[ASIN:B000R8YC18 Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]
B000002MP2|5.0|Those of us who know green day for their political stand outs and epic operas will be suprised and pleased to find this up-beat fast paced bit glamor punk album composed of brilliant songs dealing with teenage anxst, loving a girl, getting high, and about every other thing soothing to a 15 year old. WIth stellar hits like basket case and when I come around, you'll find yourself reliving the 90's and rolling up blunts before your very own eyes! 10 out of 10. For anyone who likes some good pacing and terrific melodies combined with satrical punk and plenty of questions that are pondered like \\"I'm not growing up I'm just burning out, and i step in line to walk amongst the dead\\" *Awesome bass riff*. By the way bassist mike dirnt is at his best in this album. I mean you'll never hear such a tight sounding band. The only band more well together is the clash and not to mention around this time green day also did an amazing cover of I fought the law. But anyway I'm rambling on at this point. All in all, there's no way this can't appeal to you. It's just got so many variables that make it so great. Just buy. Then factor them in. You will be pleased
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The game downloaded to my Sanyo Zio (Sprint network) just fine.  It loads fine as well, but freezes the instant level one begins.  Goes to a blank screen and then home.  Too bad, I was super excited to play.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|Previous purchases of DVD's through goHastings have been sent via first class mail, arriving in Hawaii in 4 or 5 days, but this one came via MEDIA MAIL.  It arrived in Hawaii 38 days after it was first shipped from Texas. An inquiry with USPS revealed that it came by boat.  A complaint sent to goHastings was not answered, so all I can assume is that in order to save a few pennies on postage, they are now using media mail. They will not get repeat business from me.    This was the 2-disc edition with 3 versions of the film, and the film is worth every penny, and also worth the wait. Just listening to the music (without the image) is magical.

B003Y5H55G|2.0|A couple of \\"English nerds\\" in the country for a comic book convention and tour of UFO sights come across an alien who has been here for decades and is now trying to return to his homeland. E. T. this alien is not, as he is hip, wisecracking, and foul-mouthed. They are being pursued by authorities who are tracking \\"Paul\\", as the alien is known. This film had the potential to be a real gem. I like the concept. The alien is cute, well voiced by Seth Rogen, and is a good foil for the nerdy human protagonists. However, the film is laced with profanities throughout, which is a common substitute for clever comedy. If the movie had been scripted by a clever and creative comic writer, it would be a winner. What you have here is a missed opportunity.

His guilt or innocence is seriously in question early on, and the case brings into doubt the guilt of one of his previous clients who is currently imprisoned. The lead character, Mickey Haller is not very likable, but the storyline is quite engrossing. There is no dead time in the film, with the entire movie focusing on the case at hand, keeping the viewer intrigued. The resolution of the case is not seriously in question, but the journey in getting there is worth the trip.

I like the ability this gives you to adjust volume, bass and chat volumes.    Definitely worth the purchase.

B004L49K20|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Its true, Duran Duran have made their first truly \\"New Wave\\" record since Rio. I wont call it a sequel to Rio however, as All You Need Is Now is in a class by itself. Duran Duran have FINALLY decided to just be themselves again and this renewed inspiration and vigor has led to this record. The most prominent comparison to the first two records (in my opinion anyway) is the return of John Taylor's funky bass slap playing style that was ALL OVER their early stuff. I think his style is what made their classic stuff so urgent and upbeat. Secondly, it would be Nick's synth sounds. I wouldn't be surprised if he dusted off the Jupiter 8 and used it for most of the synth-string sounds. I have to agree with Mark Ronson, that the shining moment on this album is Simon's youthful and powerful voice. The fact that he sounds this wonderful after thirty years is amazing to me.<br /><br />I'm going to focus on the \\"exclusive\\" additional tracks since everyone has already said great things about the full album so far.<br /><br />The similarity between all three is that none of them sound particularly New Wave or catchy. They are indeed experimental, to the point where it would be fair to assume these tracks were made during Medazzaland-Pop Trash era.<br /><br />Networker Nation - The lyrics are corny, as if Simon is talking to the world about how we are all joined via the internet etc etc. However, the music is great electronic with a guitar crunch and Simon's distorted vocals (great delivery as usual). Some excessive \\"Da da da's\\" can grate a bit. But hey, its a bonus song so...<br /><br />Too Close To The Sun - Ok, what is UP with Simons opening vocals. Sounds like he was just woken up out of a drunken stupor by a flashlight in the face. In fact, the vocally delivery while handled well, is very drunkenly sung. Perhaps thats what they were going for? I agree with what Nick said on his webcast a few weeks ago - Stylistically does not belong in the same universe as the full album. It sounds like a Pop Trash b-side, more rock with some electro on the side. But I like Pop Trash so that could be a good thing.<br /><br />Early Summer Nerves - Wow, talk about a left field track. I actually really like this song. This reminds me of Arcadia a LOT. Very experimental in structure and tempo. Some interesting high-range singing from Simon and funky keyboards and synthy solo sounds that are very Gary Numan sounding. Plus some whistling at the end! This song is a trip.<br /><br />The verdict is this: If you love the band and of course this album, get the Best Buy exclusive version as it has three additional songs that were not even announced until recently, and they are good tracks. A casual fan will say they are throw-away, but I disagree, as you also get a killer DVD in addition so value-wise you are getting over an hour of Duran Duran's best music in 28 years, plus some visual goodies.<br /><br />Best album of 2011, and best come-back record of the 21st century.

B0034G4OZE|2.0|Ok, you ever see a trailer for a film and think that it looks remarkable only to find that the trailer is nearly one-hundred times better than the actual film?  That was the case with `It's Kind of a Funny Story'.  I saw the trailer a while back and just thought it was going to be outstanding, but alas; it wasn't.<br /><br />For me, the films biggest distracter is that it feels so uneven in tone.  It doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be.  Well, I know what it wants to be.  It's shooting for `dramedy', but there isn't enough of either (drama or comedy) to constitute the genre reference.  Instead, it just falls flat nearly all of the time, despite some nicely constructed performances from the supporting cast.<br /><br />The film follows a young boy named Craig who wants to kill himself, or at least thinks that he wants to kill himself.  So, he seeks out immediate help from a psychiatric ward but winds up admitted for a mandatory five-days.  He feels out of water and awkward until he really sinks into the feel of the place and soon he learns so much yadda, yadda, yadda.  See, even typing the films synopsis feels flat, right?  This is my issue with the film.  It doesn't do anything special to elevate the films lack of original prose.  It just meanders.  The character arc given to Craig feels predictable and unwarranted (five days drastically changed his outlook so much, and HOW might I ask?) and so the ending feels forgettable and bland in texture.<br /><br />I found myself bored, even when the film tried to add texture by giving us flashback tricks and segments of voice over sequences.  It felt forced and low level and amateurish and nothing like what it was trying to copy.<br /><br />It's hard for me to imagine that Ryan Fleck directed this, since his directorial debut `Half Nelson' was so outstanding and serves as one of my favorite films of the past decade.<br /><br />Alas, the film is littered with very good supporting performances that try their hand at elevating their scenes.  Viola Davis is just a joy to look at, and she adds a warmth and sincerity to the preposterous psychiatric sessions she is a part of (I mean, seriously) and Emma Roberts is also decent here, and sells her character well.  But the film really belongs to Zach Galifianakis, who just delivers such a surprisingly honest portrait of a man who is battling his inner demons.  He adds the paternal touch needed for the film without going overly nostalgic or sappy on us.  Even when the film falls off the edge and dives headfirst into a saccharine mess, Galifianakis remains the film's sole look at something true; something real.<br /><br />UGH, I wanted this to be great.  Instead, it feels cheap and unfocused.  See it for Galifianakis, especially if you are a fan of his breed of comedy since he uses it with sharp maturity here, but don't expect this film to meet any preconceived expectations.is is just a joy to look at, and she adds a warmth and sincerity to the preposterous psychiatric sessions she is a part of (I mean, seriously) and Emma Roberts is also decent here, and sells her character well.

B001HN694K|1.0|I curse the day I prayed for this to happen.  Seriously, if you read the review I wrote for Disney's animated version of `Alice in Wonderland' I said that Tim Burton needed to make this a live action film.  I was salivating over the idea.  When my dreams came true I was ecstatic.  I just knew that this film would be everything I hoped it would be and then, well, it wasn't.<br /><br />It really, REALLY wasn't.<br /><br />First off, everyone and their mother needs to be forewarned that this film is NOT a direct adaptation of the classic original we all know and love.  That isn't to say that this isn't pulled from Lewis Carroll's books, it is just that it doesn't follow the animated classic we all have grown up loving.  This film follows an older Alice who has just been proposed to by a nasty young man.  She flees the scene of the proposal and falls down the rabbit hole once again except she can't remember anything from before (although she does recall some lost memories she assumes are part of a recurring dream) and so she does a lot of repeat work (I assume in an effort to draw on the nostalgia of it all) before she uncovers the reality of why she is where she is.  She has to help overthrow the Red Queen by defeating some dragon creature so that the White Queen can take her rightful place on the throne.<br /><br />Thank god for Helena Bonham-Carter.<br /><br />Ok, so let's be honest here.  This film is a total mess.  The issue here is that Burton doesn't know how to edit himself.  He throws so much at you, assuming that more is more when in actuality, it's a freakish overkill.  `Alice in Wonderland' is a trashcan filled to the brim with a months worth of leftovers that spills out onto every frame.  From the overload of colorful set pieces that just overtakes every scene to the nightmarish performance by Johnny Depp, this film is garish to an extreme.  The plotting is underwhelming.  In reading Tim Burton's take on the film, he had mentioned being unmoved and emotionally disconnected to the actual flow of the books and the original films.  He said that he wanted to create a human element here, but he lost the whole point of the tale and instead shoved a generically clich&eacute;d `formula' at us and called it UNDERLAND.<br /><br />I won't say that the visuals are bad because they are not.  In many instances they are slick and exciting, but there are just TOO MANY OF THEM.  This film is far too loud.  Sure, some may say that the point of this film is to be loud, and to an extent they are right, but this film doesn't carry the right visual feel.  This film feels forced and unfocused.  Far too much (FAR TOO MUCH) attention was given to creating dreamlike set pieces that cross the line of `tasteful' into `tacky', and far too little attention was given to fleshing out the childlike curiosity that embodied the original.<br /><br />Burton didn't `get it' and so his take on the story doesn't `get it'.<br /><br />The less said about Johnny Depp's embarrassing portrayal of The Mad Hatter the better.  Why won't he just go away?<br /><br />In the end, there are two things worth mentioning here.  The score is on one hand rather loud and forbearing but it is also appropriately used and beautiful in its own right.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter is BRILLIANT here.  I really think she needs to divorce (at least professionally) Tim Burton and solely work with other directors, but it is apparent that her talent was needed here since she livens her every scene and creates an unforgettable presence in The Red Queen.<br /><br />She's magnificent.<br /><br />Skip this trash heap, seriously.low of the books and the original films.

0061020680|4.0|Mort is the fourth book in the Discworld series, starring a sixteen-year-old boy looking to become an apprentice to someone and everyone's favorite \\"anthropomorphic personification\\", Death, who just happens to be hiring.  Mort comes to live with Death in his creepy, creepy home, filling in for him sometimes while Death goes out into the  world on a quest to discover what it means to be human.    There is also Death's daughter, Ysabell, adopted, obviously, because Death has no organs, reproductive or otherwise, and his servant, Albert.  Mort's first day on the job the young Princess Keli (who is soon to be crowned queen) is supposed to die at the hands of an assassin hired by one of the more opportunistic members of the royal family.  But she's so cute!  He can't let this innocent teenage girl die!  Mort saves Princess Keli and kills the assassin instead.  After all, how could such a good deed possibly backfire?  Unless it upset the fabric of the universe. Which it did. Of course.    This is one of the funniest books in the series and is as far from a traditional love story as one can possibly get.  For starters, Mort was raised on a farm and never saw very many girls and is never really sure until the end if he's really in love with Princess Keli or if his instincts are just telling him it's about time he fell in love with someone so it might as well be her.  Plus, Death secretly wants Mort to marry Ysabell and keeps trying to get them to like each other.  The only thing that was disappointing in this book was the ending, but those have never been Terry Pratchett's strong point.  Perhaps the only  thing left about this book that is worth mentioning is that it features a brief appearance by the recurring character, Rincewind, in what is arguably the funniest section of the book.
B004CIIXC8|5.0|I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking it too: why oh why did they make another movie about a young white girl who wants to dance hip hop?  Believe me, this film is so much richer than that subtext would suggest.  In fact, the `dancing' theme is only a small part, a segue to deeper and more complex realizations that lie buried beneath the surface of this uniquely insightful film billowing at the surface with sharp texture and undeniable presence.<br /><br />This movie is superb.<br /><br />The film focuses on a young fifteen-year-old girl named Mia.  Mia lives with her promiscuous drunk of a mother and her filthy mouthed spoiled brat sister in a crummy apartment complex.  Her life is consumed with fisticuffs and confrontation, whether at home or not.  She is filled with dreams of being a dancer, but her insecurities hold her back; reducing her to holing away in an abandoned apartment in order to practice in privacy.  A sharp knife is thrust in her reality when her mother's new boyfriend, Connor, spends the night.  Enflamed with an obvious curiosity, Mia takes a strange liking to Connor, who shows her tender attention she lacks from everyone else around her.  As Connor makes his imprint on the family dynamic, you can see Mia's perspective shifting, but she is constantly derailed by her own emotional inhibitions and the stark jealousy of her mother, which bears down on Mia in waves of aggressive remarks and actions.<br /><br />The film is an astute character study that sets down on the viewer and sinks into them, allowing the blood from the film's core to soak into us.  It's upon reflection that the film's themes grow deeper and the execution can be seen so vividly as authentic and enriching.  Each frame is a character all its own, creating lush moments within photographic sequences of trashy apartment's and grassy reeds.<br /><br />And then there are the performances, which totally embody the film's objective and elevate every scene.  Katie Jarvis is such a find.  She looks like a weathered Emma Stone and she wisps in and out of each scene with a reckless sense of ease and comfort.  You can feel her itching in her own skin, yet it breathes a normalcy needed to sell her character.  Kierston Wareing slums it lustfully as Mia's self absorbed mother, careening each scene with a charismatic sense of loathing.  She hates everything her daughter represents and yet you never feel as though she truly hates her, even when she commands her to eff-off.<br /><br />For me, the film is all about Michael Fassbender and his flawless portrayal of Connor.  Honestly, Connor is the most important character in the film because he serves as a true turning point for the characters in the film, mainly Mia.  Fassbender plays the role effortlessly, layering Connor with enough mystery to make the audience as cautious as they are trusting with him.  You never know what is true intentions are, and yet you feel as though you would give him the world, and visa-versa.  From the tinge of arrogance he exhibits upon his first meeting with Mia, allowing the knowledge of his night with her mother to slide from his shirtless back, to the tender stare he expresses while watching Mia dance; Fassbender is just enigmatic yet totally breathtaking.<br /><br />The film's focus, that of Mia's emotional growth and striving towards freedom from her apparent imprisonment, is expertly crafted in this very moving drama.  The ending is rewarding in that it gives her an out that feels refreshingly appropriate, playing to her fantasies while slashing her down to reality with a glimmer of hope; hope that tomorrow, while not quite what she had initially hoped for, will be far better than today.athered Emma Stone and she wisps in and out of each scene with a reckless sense of ease and comfort.  You can feel her itching in her own skin, yet it breathes a normalcy needed to sell her character.  Kierston Wareing slums it lustfully as Mia's self absorbed mother, careening each scene with a charismatic sense of loathing.  She hates everything her daughter represents and yet you never feel as though she truly hates her, even when she commands her to eff-off.      For me, the film is all about Michael Fassbender and his flawless portrayal of Connor.  Honestly, Connor is the most important character in the film because he serves as a true turning point for the characters in the film, mainly Mia.  Fassbender plays the role effortlessly, layering Connor with enough mystery to make the audience as cautious as they are trusting with him.  You never know what is true intentions are, and yet you feel as though you would give him the world, and visa-versa.  From the tinge of arrogance he exhibits upon his first meeting with Mia, allowing the knowledge of his night with her mother to slide from his shirtless back, to the tender stare he expresses while watching Mia dance; Fassbender is just enigmatic yet totally breathtaking.

B004529NKC|1.0|The first in the `Step Up' series was a clever take on familiar themes that layered enough charisma and attention grabbing dance moves to make it wholly enjoyable and highly memorable.  The second film was a bit too copycat like, but it was still exciting in ways and offered up some fresh new dance sequences.  This `3D' disaster is just completely uncalled for.  Offering a plot that is equal parts copycat and equal parts preposterously absurd, `Step Up 3D' overdoes the films initial objective to death and creates an unapologetically lame entry into a series that was, for the most part, quite fun.  The dance sequences utilize the 3D technology rather well, but I hate films that make it so obvious they are TRYING to be 3D.  Honestly, I'm waiting for this current craze to die down, since I don't feel like wearing glasses every time I go to the movies, and when a film is made to be seen as 3D in the manner that `Step Up 3D' is, it is almost a requirement.  Watching it at home without the glasses actually makes the film annoyingly obvious.  With that said, I found that too many of the films choreography was ripped from the second film, as well with a lot of the staging of those scenes, and the overall plot was so empty headed that it made watching it a chore.  I don't mind light hearted romps, but I hate stupid movies.  This movie is just stupid.  Oh, and what a waste of dancing talent.  How in the world could they delegate truly admirable dancers (who graced the `So You Think You Can Dance' stage) to mere supporting roles with no real highlight of their talent?  I mean, you make `So You Think You Can Dance' champ Joshua dress like a robot and dance in a public restroom?  That whole scene (not to mention the correlating video camera scene taking place in the club) was just ridiculous.  In fact, this whole movie is ridiculous.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Shades of Murmur, Automatic for the People, Out of Time...     Infectious songs that suck you in and make you sway.  Stipe's vocals are as obtuse, yet poignant as ever, and there are a TON of Mills' backing vocals on this record which I've missed.      After some uneven work, this is the best record they've made since New Adventures in HiFi (underrated).    Some songs are downright jangly!!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Does what it says on the box. Would be nice to have fancier page turning animation a la I books, and more settings for text colors and fonts, but three provided schemes are okay. Can flip pages with volume buttons - very convenient on phone. Syncs last read position with Kindle reader, and any other device you have with Kindle app installed.  By the way, it can read any books in MobiPocket format (NOT EPUB), and not just from Kindle Store. If you copy a book to /sdcard/kindle (using any Android file manager) it'll load them and show in book list view on main screen. Some online book stores offer them in this format, e.g. LitRes. If you only have ePub you can convert to Mobi using Calibre. Anyway, why would you want to? If most of your books are from Kindle Store, and you don't want to have another reader for the few which arent.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|As an avid player of this addictive game, I downloaded this one from Amazon.  I was amazed!  The graphics and ease of play on both my Samsung Fascinate and my Samsung Tablet are bar none.  I recommend this game to anyone that has a better than average screen.  Any of the latest Verizon Android OS devices will work perfectly.  I am already looking forward to the next version of this game.
1423124960|5.0|My four-year-old daughter and I loved this book. Each story is the perfect length -- ten minutes or so -- for bedtime reading. The illustrations are beautiful and the dialogue is great. I'm not sure who enjoyed the book more, my daughter or me. A nice gift for any four-year-old or thereabouts who loves the Disney princesses.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|When I was shopping for a TV, I was relentless in my research, and looked at so many TV's, and so many ads, and so many stores, all showing images that would show the TV at its best. With this show: this is your TV at its best. It is hands down the best eye candy ever...Oh, and the stories about animals are nice too. But of course, coming from the best nature documentary team with the highest budget in the history of mankind.    Cheers,

B002JCSRKC|4.0|These boots were part of my Christmas wish list.  I can say I didn't regret wearing the boots.  It is really light and comfy.  The only thing that's a drawback is that the boots are stiff in the ankle and lower calf area that it makes it uncomfortable to drive in.  It was awkward to walk in it at first but I got used to it.  I always look forward to rain just to play in the puddle.  Plus I get added compliments.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat when I watched this movie!  It was great!  It's a great survival movie and is very exciting!  I loved it! I'd be more specific, but I don't' want to give the plot away...let's just say that it's filled with action, fear and anguish.  It's good practice trying to problem solve for the characters of the movie.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|As always, Picoult's book is timely and well written. The book kept me up late at night as I couldn't wait to find out what happened!! Her characters are realistic, her verbiage is sophisticated and the plot line is compelling. Love this author and everything she writes
B00006JJ51|5.0|Only the 2002 Remaster is HDCD. There are several remasters out there. Also the Ni---4life 2002 is a HDCD. Sound Quality - Overall is very detailed. The Bass is tight and deep with very little roll off at higher volumes. The highs come through very strong but not ear piercing. The dialouge is front and center and never drowned out by the bass. As someone with a pretty extensive high resloution music library, from classical to rap. I'm surprised at how some of the HDCD's sound. This one is excellent, a must own. As there are very few SACD's and even DVD-AUDIO's of good quality rap music. Another very well done HDCD is Dire Straights - sultans of swing (very best of). If you own a SACD Player, the SACD version is one of the absolute best sounding I've heard.  Anyway 5 star prformance for N.W.A. The remaster (2002) version is a excellent recording, well worth adding to your music library, Thank you.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read this book just before I got my kindle. It was recomended to me by the owner of a local comic shop I go to. Once I started reading i found i could not put the book down. Some nights i fell asleep with the book in my hands. George R.R. Martim goes so in depth with his characters. The story is so good even HBO is making a show on it. I highly recomend this book and the whole &#34;A song of ice and fire&#34; series to all fantasy lovers.
B00063EMJG|5.0|First I'll review the cd portion, then the dvd. First off this is a HDCD, which on my system You'll hear a difference. I use an A/V system which includes a Denon AVR 4310 & Denon DBP4010 with the denon link cable for all audio. The speaker system is PSB Image T6 with a PSB Subsonic 8. For how old this recording is, the sound is quite good. Down by the river, Cinnamon Girl, Only Love Can Break your Heart, OHIO & Heart of Gold are my favs. At higher volumes I do hear alittle hiss, but only when the music fades out. The Guitar comes at you from the sides of the soundstage on Down by The river, as well as the back up singers. The bass is somewhat muddy sounding, but seems intentional. After The Goldrush has a great soundstage. Neil's voice has a strong front presence, with the piano coming from the surrounds. On Only Love Can Break your Heart, the sound quality jumps up a notch. With a strong surround presence. Overall this one has a nice flat response with just a hint of bass. I aslo didn't notice a big difference from the DVD to the HDCD. Also the DVD is just an Audio DVD with the song title on the screen and a record player. (If you're under 20 don't ask what a record player is.) The insert is a fold out poster of the cover. Since we can't get Neil on SACD, because he doesn't support it. We have to settle on HDCD's and a few DVD-AUDIO's. Thank  you.
B000M4RG42|5.0|This film depicts war as war is and the way men are affected in battle.    The producers did notable work in this movie and the version showing  the Japanese view [[ASIN:B003ASLJPY Letters from Iwo Jima]]of the same impact on their men.    Relatives and friends who were there are no longer in this dimension.   No one we knew, who was there, discussed the events.

B00005614N|5.0|I read someone's review calling this album an essential American classic, and it really is. Two giants of American music - each having played and recorded for 40 years or so - captured together for their one and only recording session, and everyone in the studio those two days in April 1961 were at the top of their game. It sounds like they were completely enjoying these sessions.    I've had this album, first on vinyl and 2 copies on CD now for nearly 30 years and still every time I hear Satchmo's solo in \\"Solitude\\", the hair on my neck still stands on end and my eyes tear up from the emotion coming out of his horn. Amazing. And that's just one of the great songs here.     Essential, and a classic. I thank whatever gods brought these two guys (and Armstrong's combo) together 50 years ago and had the good sense to put them on tape finally.

1594202842|1.0|This is quite possibly one of the most depressing books I have ever read. I am glad that I did not spend money to line Amy Chua's pockets and borrowed this from my local library. Read it and wonder why DYFS was not engaged.  Read it and wonder why someone is permitted to abuse her daughters verbally. At first I thought some of what she wrote was exaggerated; she was joking and expanding what really happened in order to make a more engaging story. Instead, it's incredibly obvious as the book goes on that everything she wrote is factual and I still - 2 weeks after I finished the book - cannot believe that she actually admits to the verbal abuse she inflicted on her daughters. Amy Chua's first daughter is compliant to her demands; her second is not. What it look to wake Amy Chua up is heart-rending.  She doesn't even listen to her own husband who is telling her she is too hard on her daughters. This book is an embarrassment and I am offended by it on her behalf.  I still don't think Amy Chua understands how bad she was and how lucky she is that things didn't turn out with a more violent ending.
0061537969|5.0|Who would have thought a book written from a dog's perceptive could be so good? I have to admit I had my doubts and to be honest and until about half way though I enjoyed it but didn't LOVE it. About half way through the book it grabbed me and didn't let me go. It made me sad, angry and had me laughing out loud! It was truly a touching book that I ended up loving. We read it for book club and we still quote Enzo from time to time. He is too funny! Great, great book!!
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|Sean Johnson has done a fantastic job curating here: he has chosen songs from around the world--so we not only have Indian and American kirtan, but African and European musicians. The obvious more 'famous' (and excellent) choices are here, like Krishna Das and Jai Uttal, but we also have many lesser known Yoga musicians. So there is alot to discover here. I find that this CD is mellow enough to play in its entirety for a Massage session as well as for a Yoga class (I'm a healer and Yoga teacher). And the songs are interesting and unique. And its such a soothing collection. Many songs move me. It is truly healing music.
B003UESJJC|1.0|While I have not purchased the said disc, I dont understand why put out Blu Ray Discs that dont have Blu-Ray Standards. Apparently the aspect has been played with and no DTS Master or Dolby True HD. Just a cash in, in addition it is a mix of two editions Re-Dux and the original.

0596805888|4.0|\\"Cooking for Geeks\\" is supposed to be written especially for computer geeks.

The noce thing about this book is its different approach on the subject of cooking. It not just state things but explains them.
0061020680|5.0|Mort, the child of a farmer, did not really show any aspiration to follow in the footsteps of his father. His problem was not that he didn't have the will, but more that he kept thinking too long before doing anything. Giving up all hope to ever achieve anything useful, his father sent him to a local hiring fair in the hope to land him an apprenticeship. But even that did almost turn out to be a disaster. Almost. Luckily just before the market was about to close, a rather peculiar entity showed up and addressed him in CAPITALS. To the other people this person looked like an undertaker, but Mort saw right through it... literally.<br /><br />This fourth book of the popular Discworld series was elected as one of the most beloved books in the BBC's 2003 Big Read contest. And that is arguably due to the character of Dead. It's the first of the Death series, although Death himself already appeared briefly in the previous books, and elaborates on the fantastic world of Death also known as Death's Domain. It also introduces some strange concepts like the `reannual plants', plants you have to sow one year after you harvest them. It's these kind of crazy idea's that make Mort such a wonderful gem of a book. Nevertheless, the actual story tends to get pushed a bit to the background, which sometimes leads to a quite difficult to comprehend story arc. Luckily the denouement gets first price in shedding some light on this chaotic story. At least that is what I thought... or maybe it was not and I got completely transcendental too. Who's talking there in capitals?

B004ISVH7U|5.0|I heard about this release back in December and as soon as I could, I  pre-ordered on Amazon, the neighborhood record shop. Now I already have many various editions of the CD (and in the past LP, cassette but not the 8-track!).  In a way this seemed more like the 40th Edition rather than anniversary.  But the real reason I placed my order was to again see SONGS OF AMERICA, Simon & Garfunkel's tv special which, as a 19-year-old fan, I cut short Thanksgiving to get back to my dorm's basement tv room (lounge is too strong of a word) and watch the special which someone must have tipped me off about, not having a tv or a newspaper subscription.  And I was truly blown away.  Maybe 25 years later or more I got a VHS bootleg and again was amazed but this presentation on the new \\"deluxe edition\\" of the 40th anniversary release is exceptional.  The Grodin/Garfunkel/Simon production is not \\"slick\\" but \\"handheld\\", raw, humorous, moving and real.  Yet as others have said, the greatest bonus here is THE HARMONY GAME documentary which truly was one of this fan's greatest highs...seeing young and old Art and Paul, the wrecking crew, Roy Halee given plenty of airtime, and even Mort Lewis--their old business manager who had such kind word to say and memories to share.  And while not much was said about \\"Baby Driver\\", \\"Why Don't You Write Me\\" or \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied\\", there is plenty of color and retrospective to make me do what I'm doing now--listen[ing] again to BOTW.  Now if they could could officially release (hope springs eternal) \\"Cuba Si! Nixon No!\\" and a DVD version of the also exceptional documentary\\"BORN AT THE RIGHT TIME , all would be up to date.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|As my review title suggests...I love this film!  And if you love a good romance this is the film for you.    Basically Elena Undone is just that...a film about a woman coming \\"undone\\", letting go of what she's always thought she was suppose to be and finding what and who she truly is.  Elena (played by Necar Zadegan) is a pastor's wife and a mother of a teenage boy.  She has, as so many people do, given up her life's dreams to meet the expectations of her family and in doing so lost herself.  The basic plot line is this...In two totally random situations Elena meets Peyton (played by Traci Dinwiddie) and they strike up a friendship.  From the moment they meet you can see they have a strong connection.  And as their friendship grows so does that connection.  As Elena realizes just how strong her draw to Peyton is she has to ask herself: Am I a lesbian? Is this relationship what I want? Am I being selfish if I choose this relationship? Can I live without Peyton?  I really dislike it when reviewers give a play by play plot summary so I'm not going to do that.  You'll just have to watch the movie to find out what Elena chooses.  The last thing I want to say about this film is that it's not like a lot of other independent lesbian films.  The plot is actually very tight and flows smoothly.  The performances are amazing.  Traci (Peyton) and Necar (Elena) give unbelievable performances.  Their chemistry is so strong.  But one of things I think that makes this movie so good is that all the actors do such a great job.  Nicole Conn, the writer and director, has done such a great job of creating such amazing supporting characters.  There's Wave, Peyton's best friend (played by Mary Wells).  All I have to say about her is...I'd love to have her as my friend.  She's fun and loyal.  Then there's Tyler, Elena's best friend (played by Sam Harris...love him!).  While Elena is the nurturer for her family, he is her nurturer.  And the kids in this film!  They, too, give great performances, especially Sabrina Fuster (she plays Elena's son's girlfriend).  I love her quirky character.  All in all, this is a movie with a great story, interesting characters, and great performances.  Definitely two thumbs up!  Buy it!  You won't be disappointed.
B004S8NBDI|5.0|Under Cover of Darkness and Machu Picchu are classics but the real gem is the Life Is Simple In The Moonlight. I feel that this album was a revival for the band and its a pleasure to see them focusing on the music with the same passion that they had for Is This It.
0312360258|3.0|As the first book in the series, this book sucked me into the world that the Cast's created and had me picking up the next books in the series before I even finished the first one.    The book starts with Zoey being Marked and having to leave her life as a human to move to the House of Night and live with the other fledglings. If that's not bad enough, she's been given special powers by Nyx (the vampyre's goddess) and has to deal with everything that comes with that. She becomes fast friends with her roommate, Stevie Rae, and her group of friends that include the \\"twins,\\" Shaunee and Erin, and Damien. There is, of course, a group of mean girls that make up the Dark Daughters - a special fledgling group on campus for only the most special of fledglings on campus. Zoey and the leader of the Dark Daughters, Aphrodite,  do not get along - causing normal teenage shenanigans throughout the book. When Zoey discovers what evil things the Dark Daughters are really up to it takes Zoey, her special powers, and her group of friends to stop some deadly events from taking place.    I really enjoy the world that the Cast's start to create in the first book of this series. It is full of crazy teenage drama but it was just one of those stories that you can escape into and not worry about anything else for a few hours.
B002WY65VU|3.0|Greetings \\"...of the Dead\\" fans:<br />Middle of the road...the beginning is strange, but you begin to like the characters except the virgin boy guy...leave him and go with the girls,<br />he he he.  However I think the whole idea of cross country driving to get to a Amusement Park is dumb...please! I love the surprise actor we meet...<br />but it's LA!  Come on, everyone is an actor or gas station attendant...I won't tell what happens...you judge if you accept it or not...I didn't c<br />are for it, but I accepted it.  Told you the virgin boy was a pain in the zombie ass.  The film has good points and a lot of ooops moments...it's better than you think after watching a few times, but Harrelson?  I think Gary Busey would have been wonderful!  That's why there are reviews!<br />The film is not a winner, not even close, but for $5 and a sandwich (or<br />is it?) stuck in your teeth, it's OK...
0316077054|5.0|Oh, how I loved this book! I didn't read Beautiful Creatures that long ago, maybe a month or so but I thought this book would never come out. I thought I had it the Saturday before it was suppose to come out - they had put it out at Target early but when I went to check out it wouldn't go through. I was so sad, ya'll!    This book picks up where Beautiful Creatures left off with our characters dealing with the things that happened at the end of the book.  It's so hard to even say anything without ruining Beautiful Creatures for you! But with Lena pulling away and Ethan struggling with the trials going on in his life the book takes you on a different journey with Ethan and Lena. The teen love angst was definitely felt more in this story but it was definitely needed and what made the story that much more enjoyable.    I flew through this book though. There was so much going on and it was different from Beautiful Creatures but in a good way. I loved Ethan even more in this one. I love that the voice in this book is a guy - you don't see that a lot in YA books. And guys can be just as tortured and in love as girls.    If you haven't read these - pick them up. They are completely fantastic and with THAT ending (!!) I can't wait for the next one!    (Oh, I also listened to some of - definitely still love the guy reading them.)
B003EYVXYG|1.0|Greetings fellow '...of the Deaders':  It is with deep regret that a Romero film has finally bit the undead on the ass as the \\"Survival of the Dead\\" really sucks, blows and stinks!  If I had seen it BEFORE ordering it, I would have saved my money.  The concept of two family of idiots fighting over their dead relatives and keeping them chained up around (as long as they're out of biting range) is INANE!  And of course the living kill of the remaining living humans with no guilt or further thought! Reminds me of \\"the Dawn of the Dead\\" when a scientist teaches a zombie to behave.  I found Flynn and his lunatic opposite both due a double tap to the brain.  Just dumb. Oh and the sceanery of an island off Delaware doesn't have mountains in the background... The whole film was disjointed and pathetic...I love zoombie films but they have to have   a plot; this film was made to make money off the Romero name and prior great zoombie films.  Sorry George.
1936594366|4.0|Siddhartha is a philosophical novel about one man's quest for spiritual enlightenment. The story takes place about 500 BC in India. Siddhartha, the son of a Hindu Brahmin, groomed to become a Brahmin himself, turns his back on the teachings of his father and leaves his village to search for inner peace. He renounces all worldly possessions and joins the samanas, ascetic mendicants who live in the forest. Siddhartha then meets Gotama, the Buddha, but ultimately decides to seek his own path rather than follow the Buddha's teachings. At this point Siddhartha turns his back on his thoughtful life of fasting and meditation, and begins a worldly life of lust and greed. Though the meaning of life continues to elude Siddhartha, and he finds each new lifestyle to be inadequate to answer his metaphysical questions, along the way he learns something valuable from each stage of his journey, and this accumulation of knowledge and experience advances him step by step on the path towards enlightenment.<br /><br />Hermann Hesse is a masterful writer who deservedly won the Nobel Prize in 1946. Many of his novels revolve around the quest for knowledge and wisdom, yet all differ greatly in their setting and tone. Siddhartha is written in deceptively simple prose. It reads almost like a fairy tale, yet Hesse's economy of words masks a rich depth of philosophical insight and spiritual understanding. It is a very short novel, easy to read, and accessible to readers of all levels from junior high to PhD, though the deeper philosphical concepts may escape younger readers. Due to its brevity and the inherent ambiguity in its spiritual subject matter, this novel can be enjoyed again and again, with new discoveries made in each rereading. It provides a good introduction to the philosphy of eastern religions, Hinduism and Buddhism in particular, though one may also recognize in the text elements from schools of western philosophical thought like pantheism, stoicism, and cynicism (in the Greek sense of the word). But a big part of the message of the novel is that enlightenment cannot be reached by labeling movements or perusing texts. One can only find inner peace by living life, by experiencing. Wisdom can be learned but cannot be taught. For those engaged in their own quest, this book does not provide a treasure map with a big red X where lie all the answers to your metaphysical queries. It's more like one solitary signpost along a winding path, with a simple arrow pointing the way.sense of the word).

B0021L8V0W|4.0|As I've said several times before, the sub-genre of spy films (or espionage/spy thrillers as they're sometimes referred) has long been a popular well for Hollywood to draw from for inspiration and box office success. Typically these films have centered on a tough-as-nails male action hero type, many times with a strong desire for women and specific types of alcoholic beverages. In 2010, that all changed with the release of the action-packed thrill ride \\"Salt\\" starring Angelina Jolie (\\"Wanted\\") in the title role.    \\"Salt\\" chronicles the espionage powder keg that explodes when CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a double agent for Russia tasked with assassinating the President of the United States. With her loyalty in question, her career in jeopardy, and the life she's known being turned on its ear; Salt will do whatever it takes to clear her name, reclaim her life, and prevent an international incident from occurring before time runs out.    Let me start by saying this: leave it to Angelina Jolie to be the first woman to successfully infiltrate this predominantly male headlined sub-genre of film. Not only that, but with her acting prowess, determination and physicality, be able to convincingly portray a character that can stand toe-to-toe with Bond and Bourne. Of course, this shouldn't be that surprising given that Angelina has proven time and again through various roles that there is not a single genre in which she cannot find success.    As the character of Evelyn Salt, Angelina is truly run through a veritable gauntlet of physical and emotional tests. In one scene she can be scaling the side of a very tall building (a stunt she performed herself) or witnessing a horrible act as she tries to remain stoic, but a subtly quivering lip belies her inner turmoil. Or desperately trying to convince those around her of the truth; no matter what the scene calls for Angelina always delivers to perfection.    I don't think there are too many other actresses out there, if any, that could have believably pulled off such a demanding role that is rife with intensity, duplicity, drama, and action. Sure several actresses could have handled some of the facets of the character, but all of them? In this I believe Angelina stands alone, and that is why I believe her to be probably the best, and certainly the most versatile, actress of her generation.    An interesting side note for the character is that originally Tom Cruise (\\"Mission: Impossible\\") was attached to the role, but reportedly dropped out to film the romantic action comedy \\"Knight and Day\\". Thus, prompting the role to be rewritten from a male to a female, supposedly with Angelina in mind from then on.    Anyway, alongside Angelina are two very talented actors in the primary supporting roles, Liev Schreiber (\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\") and Chiwetel Ejiofor (\\"Four Brothers\\").    Liev plays a fellow CIA agent of Salt's named Ted Winter, and is the only person at the agency who seems to believe that she is innocent of the accusations against her. Liev's character is a mixture of the typical no-nonsense agent, but with a healthy sense of humor and a protective, brotherly relationship with Salt. Aside from those character traits, Liev also imbues the character with charm and an underlying sense that he will do whatever it takes to protect Salt whether she's innocent or guilty.    All together Liev's performance makes his character much more memorable than one would expect from such a role. Plus, the early scenes between him and Salt bantering back and forth are enjoyable to watch.    As for Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays a government operative named Peabody who unlike Winter is not inclined to simply believe in Salt's innocence, despite her years of service to the red, white, and blue. For the most part, Ejiofor plays the role by the book as the clichéd government stooge that is blind to anything except the evidence on display. Even with this fairly one-dimensional character, Chiwetel still manages to make his scenes pop, thanks entirely to his charismatic disposition.    One more bit of casting I would like to discuss before moving on, and this one in particular struck me as odd when watching this film. Why, oh why did Andre Braugher (\\"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\") sign on to the most thankless role of Secretary of Defense? With an actor of his caliber and credibility, one would expect that he signed on for the role due to it being such a good character. However, he's given nothing to do other than run around in one scene and hand phones to people, all the while saying only a sentence of dialogue.    Seriously, this is a role that should have been handled by some no-name actor or even someone like Cuba Gooding, Jr. who has been relegated to the realm of Direct-to-DVD. Wasting the talent of Andre Braugher on a role such as this is completely mind-boggling and somewhat insulting to his long-lasting career. But, overall this was a minor issue and I digress.    Of course the cast would be nothing without the script written by Kurt Wimmer (\\"A Perfect Getaway\\"), who has proven yet again to be a terrific storyteller. Loaded with twists and turns, gripping action set pieces, and engaging drama, the story for \\"Salt\\" is entertaining from start to finish.    Understandably with a movie like this one has to be careful in how much is revealed, because the risk of spoiling is incredibly high. So, the only other thing I will say about this film's story is this: at the end of the movie, I guarantee you will be left begging for more.    Now I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the other major contributor to this movie's success, director Phillip Noyce (\\"Clear and Present Danger\\"). With a movie so jam-packed with fast-paced, hard-hitting action scenes one would expect the movie to have been directed by someone more oriented with the action genre. Not to say that Phillip Noyce is unfamiliar with action scenes, it's just his films aren't generally so heavy in this area. Even so, he directs the pulse-pounding action with as sure a hand as he does during the quieter, more dramatic moments.    Also, Noyce's excellent directing and pacing of the film ensured that the story was provided plenty of breathing room to unfold naturally; that way it wouldn't seem as if the story was there to serve the action rather than the other way around. And the use of flashbacks, which can backfire for some films, was perfect for providing character development and context, while breaking up the monotony of linear storytelling. It's no wonder why Phillip Noyce is heralded as a master of the espionage thriller.    All in all, \\"Salt\\" is a thoroughly entertaining movie, filled to the brim with excitement and intrigue. This film and its star, Angelina Jolie, prove that they belong in the pantheon of spy thrillers and hopefully we haven't seen the last of Evelyn Salt.    \\"Salt\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.

B0034G4OZE|5.0|This is exactly what I needed when I saw it in theaters. While I am not as academically challenged, the AP courses I was taking at the time had me nearly as stressed and almost as close to the edge.   When he first started to explain himself, as best as he could, I felt like I was looking in a mirror.  The acting and cinematography is perfectly suited for this movies genre, and I had to laugh the allusion to \\"One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\\"(it was the use of the phrase \\"You should be out on Coney Island Bird-dogging chicks\\").  I loved the underlying theme of gratitude in all this, and I loved how both of the leads learned from each other.   I own this, and I take it out every time life starts getting to me.

B003R0MF5I|5.0|NBC's Chuck is one of those \\"little\\" shows that crawls under your skin in way that you find yourself in one point where you realize you are a complete addict. Yes, I am one of them - Chuck's addicts and my judgment cannot be objective, but if you wanna check my theory just browse wast space of internet and you will find millions of post (mostly on twitter) where this \\"little\\" show is glorified beyond any other TV show. Why is it so. Well, reason one is for sure the fact that show doesn't it in any TV cliche - although it looks like one of several newly streamlined nerd/geek shows, it's actually - TV genre on its own. It is Action, Drama, Comedy, Romance, Spy Thriller & Sci-Fi - all in one amazing mix of 1 hour of TV entertainment. Genre of its own is Chuck's blessing that makes it so appealing to millions of dedicated fans but at the same time it is its curse cause it doesn't fit in networks \\"usual\\" & one-faced program slots. As a result - this amazing show is in constant flux and permanent state of \\"bubble\\".  Unfair ratings - over Nielsen, are disappointing cause statistics as always takes \\"representative\\" household models & test subjects - typical families. But If you are a part of any social network and if you browse people who are interested in Chuck on generic level - you will find that Chuck's audience ages spread goes (at least) 11 - 50, men & women, mainly between 19 & 40 all over the world. That says something about the quality & variety of Chuck - isn't it?  Amazing Zachary Levi (plays main character - Chuck) is so comfortable in his role you got a feeling he doesn't even have to try to act - he looks like he is not playing Chuck - but he is Chuck in a real life. Beautiful and amazingly talented actress Yvonne Strahovski (plays Sarah Walker, CIA agent and Chuck's fake girlfriend - handler / girlfriend / *** spoiler) leaves viewer stunned & not just because of her top-model looks, but cause she is \\"chameleon\\" capable to express entire palette of emotions insingle one hour episode (i.e. Season 4 Episode 9 \\"Chuck versus Phase 3). Adam Baldwin (colonel Casey), Joshua Gomez (Morgan), Ryan McPartlin (\\"Captain\\" Awesome), Sarah Lancaster (Chuck's sister) and many more are team that creates magic. Sure, as any show, Chuck has great and not so great episodes, but overall it's a fun filled hour of TV entertainment.  Season 4 is giving us amazing guest star extravaganza - Linda Hamilton (Chuck's mother), Timothy Dalton (amazing villain Volkoff), John Laroquette (again as charming agent Roan Montgomery) and many, many more.  As far as storyline goes I don't want to spoil anything 4 international Chucksters - but main thing is that the show is growing in a natural way that real life goes without usual forward/backward steps in other shows. Season 4 is next step in the evolution of this amazing show & I sincerely hope (I pray to God) there will be Season 5 of fun/action/drama/comedy/romance/Sci-Fi TV entertainment called - Chuck.
0312330529|5.0|This is indeed a great book. The story is thrilling, the characters are memorable (I loved Prabaka and Didier Levy) and you just can't leave it aside.  Suffice to say I am planning on going to visit  Mumbai after reading the book.   I recommend the audio version. The narrator is superb and adds a lot to the story. He transforms himself into Prabaka, into Didier and gives life to the characters. You even forget that it is a man narrating the dialogues of women. He is THAT good.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|dont like these movies at all ,rather read about it in news lifes to short to dwell on bad things like this.
1439152780|5.0|Once during adolescence I read THE WANDERER by Alain-Fournier.  Not since then have I read a novel as subtly captivating as THE DISTANT HOURS.  In both, an adult narrator tells the story of a numinous era in their life when a gateway in life is crossed, a threshold that fundamentally transforms them.  I found this novel very entrancing in description and intricate plot detail, with the mysterious ruined castle, the sisters laden with deep secrets, and throughout the brooding darkness of walls that whisper of a tragic past that gave birth to the legend of a \\"mud man\\" who appears at lofty windows in the night.<br /><br />Perhaps the highest compliment I can give this work is that I lost track of time whenever I sat down to read it.<br /><br />I will eagerly seek out this author's other works.
8877547006|5.0|It is only that I read this simplified French version, I feel the great the author is.<br /><br />On the other hand, this simplified version is not as good as the simplified French versions from this publisher, CIDEB. Perhaps the book is too great and too good to simplify.<br /><br />The background information in this book is useful. More French words are not usually seen in modern time.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I have read and enjoyed Sanderson's other works (Mistborn, etc.) so I was interested to see how this new series started out.  Overall, I would say this was a good book, but not one of his best.  My main issue with this book, compared to his other works, is that it is very long winded and the story really didn't pick up until the last quarter of the book.  I found myself skimming many chapters just to get through them and into the important parts.  I am very concerned that he is modeling this series after the Jordan books (and that is NOT a good thing).  Hopefully this doesn't turn into a 10 year-in-the-making series that drags out too long, but only time will tell.  However, if you've enjoyed Sanderson's other books and enjoy longer, more detailed novels, I would recommend picking this up....perhaps when it drops a little in price.

B000003CM8|5.0|I didn't get into Led Zeppelin-and I don't want to start a who was better debate here-because my roommates at the time bought Led Zeppelin II, loved it, played it to death, and I picked up the first Allman Brothers album instead.  I had never heard anything so intense this side of Robert Johnson.  Gregg sounded like he was in mortal pain and the guitars screamed like panthers.  And then there was that floating rhythmn section.  Imagine my surprise-and my deranged grin- when I remembered that Gregg gave Berry Oakley credit for the opening riff for Whipping Post and years later I discovered that Berry stole the riff from Rachmaninoff's cello concerto. If you're going to be the best, you gotta steal from the best.
159420229X|5.0|This book was an Amazon recommendation, and it was spot on. Joshua Foer does a fantastic job sharing his experiences into the world of competitive memorization, as well as educating the reader in the mile high view of the history of memory.<br /><br />This is not a self-help book. Joshua doesn't paint memorization skills as a cure-all for life's short comings. However, answer seekers won't be left wanting.<br /><br />Good read. Enjoy.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|In its surprisingly good fourth season, \\"Chuck\\" continues its highly entertaining blend of drama, comedy, and romance.  Nice guy computer nerd and newly minted CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levi) is finally teamed, both personally and professionally, with the lovely and deadly CIA agent Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski).<br /><br />At the beginning of Season Four, Chuck and best buddy Morgan (Joshua Gomez) search for Chuck's long missing mother Mary Bartkowski (extended cameo by Linda Hamilton), thought to be a rogue agent working for the villainous international arms dealer Alexei Volkov (a superbly over-the-top Timothy Dalton).  In a multi-episode sequence, Chuck, Morgan, Sara and the famously gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin) track and eventually confront Mary Bartkowski and Volkov.  Mary's loyalties are something of a mystery, especially after she deprives Chuck of the use of the Intersect embedded in his brain, which provides him with his spy skills.<br /><br />Season Four was originally scheduled for 13 episodes, before being extended to a full season.  Lucky fans get two season finales.  In the first, Team Bartkowski tries to protect Chuck's sister Ellie from the Volkov gang, as she prepares to give birth to her first child with husband Captain Awesome, and as Chuck seeks a quiet moment to propose to the evasive Sara.  In the second, Chuck and Sara must escape the revenge of the Volkov family long enough to bring off their own wedding.<br /><br />The steam could easily have gone out of the series after Chuck and Sara finally got together, but the creative team of Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak keeps finding ways to keep it funny and interesting.  Any number of boomer TV series and movie dramas get hilariously ripped off this season, while a parallel storyline has Casey and Morgan as mismatched house mates and agent partners, with Morgan trying to keep secret his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.<br /><br />\\"Chuck: The Complete Fourth Season\\" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.to fans of the series.
0525423273|5.0|I first heard of this book through a Goodreads.com giveaway. Neither the cover nor description grabbed my attention, so I didn't enter the giveaway. A month or so ago I started noticing a lot of people mentioning the book; John Green even acknowledged it on his YouTube channel. Friends and other authors discussed it on Twitter, and they all had positive things to say. I got caught up in the word-of-mouth buzz and ended up giving the book a second look.    I really enjoy the way Emilly Giffin conveys relationships in her stories. I found the same to be true with the author of this story. Perkins artfully depicts the intricate ups and downs of a growing teenage relationship throughout this book. She is able to build the friendship between Anna and Étienne naturally. The pacing is never rushed or fake. I felt myself getting more involved in the story as their feelings for each other grew. When they encountered the awkward stumbling blocks caused by their growing feelings for each other, I felt the tension that developed. The moments of joy and happiness they experience affected me as if they were my own.    The other relationships depicted in the story demonstrate the same depth. You understood Anna's anger when she and a friend got in a fight. I felt the sadness she experienced when she missed her family back home. The many emotions were depicted so truthfully that it made the book feel like more than just a story. This realism made a tale that was impossible to put down.    Review: I am so glad that I was persuaded to give this story a second another look. Anna and the French Kiss turned out to be a fantastic book that I couldn't wait to finish. I can not wait to read the companion novel-Lola and the Boy Next Door-in September.
B004NSVE3W|4.0|I loved this book's writing style. It definitely brought real laughs while everyone was in Gunshot, TN. The exploration of relationship from the perspective of someone who doesn't understand people but knows a lot of information is a fresh perspective. The reading went fast but only because the story was so intriguing that I had to keep reading. I greatly recommend this for anyone in high school and above. Five stars and a thumbs up, John Green. Good job!<br />[[ASIN:B004NSVE3W An Abundance of Katherines]]
0061537969|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.

Try it you won't be dissapointed with the story line, wonderfully written.
0091922348|5.0|The layout of the book is fantastic, and reflects the authors's purpose to \\"keep food as natural as possible, avoiding complicated cooking methods\\". Each recepe is introduced with very useful comments and, for the best of all, at the coocking instructions themselves, one can find instantaneous comments like \\"by this stage (of cooking) your kitchen will have the most   magnificent charred smell\\".

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I hate that people are giving the game a bad rap because of the appstore. The game is smooth on my stock di and I have had no issues.

0307460444|5.0|I have ordered four cupcake books from Amazon this past month and had I chosen this one first, my search would have been over. This book is truly the only cupcake book you should need. I know that there are many who collect cookbooks and that is well and good. For those of you who want delicious recipes, ideas on decorations, how to's, many color photos and a section of sources to obtain items, this book gives them all. I am not what you would consider a fan of Martha Stewart but after going through this cupcake book, I must admit that I am now. The book is very well made, the contents is short of spectacular and the recipes are not difficult. There are a few that will take some time but we all want to go a little further and do something that is not just 1,2,3 and it is done. As a cake decorator myself, I appreciate the many decorative cupcakes for their simplicity, creativeity and those that go beyond the routine of decorating. There are new ideas to be gained from this book and from them, you automaticlly begin thinking of other ideas that you can impliment into your own decorating. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has the desire to make beautiful, delicious cupcakes.
B003WSFXKY|1.0|I used to be the world's biggest Santana fan, but he may have lost me for good with this. In a recent interview with Guitar Player magazine, Carlos spoke about initially resisting the entreaties of Clive Davis to do this project. After finally giving in, he commented, \\"..It's not like I'm putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa...\\". Carlos should have followed his gut on this one, as there is absolutely no reason that he (or anyone else, for that matter) should be messing with \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".     Putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa is exactly what he has done here, I'd give it zero stars if that was an option.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I *REALLY* wanted to love this book. I really did, but I just couldn't.    Overall, the story is great. I love the premise and the plot.     However, Harkness' writing borders on terrible, and at best is amateurish. The storytelling lags severely in many places as well, and I was left many times wishing she would just get on with it already.     That, and the obvious and incessant obsession with trying to attract Twilight Fans is annoying.    I stuck with it though, because an Entertainment Weekly review said that it has an \\"extremely satisfying ending\\", which I thought might redeem it's flaws, but I now wonder if the reviewer for EW even actually read the book, because there literally IS NO ending to this book. Harkness stops writing just before the climax, which is extremely frustrating.     It is obvious from the last page, that Harkness intended on a sequel... but I won't be buying it, because she has no idea how to satisfy a reader. If I'm going to feel like I'm dragging my feet through the entire book only to be left with NO CLOSURE at the end, I want nothing to do with it any of it's ancestors. I understand cliff hangers. This is not a cliff hanger. This is a cheap and nasty \\"You'll buy my next book to see how this one ends.\\" ending.    What Harkness does excel at is creating characters. Her characters are lovable and attractive, and their stories are compelling. I will miss them. At least until I see the movie, which is bound to be better than the book.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This is a great read if you are into the vampire/fantasy genre.  I am halfway through the book and love it.  The reason I have given it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of her references and content seem to be a little too similar to that of other series of this genre such as Twilight, Sookie Stackhouse and the Fever Series by Karen Marie Moning.  It takes away from the originality of the story line somewhat but all in all it's a great story and I can't put it down!!
B004RJMUJO|2.0|App seems to have been ported from iOS... it runs VERY slow on Android. Graphics are also low Res and animations run slow. All these facts make you go back to iOS to play this title.

B004L49K20|5.0|They definitely took their time in putting this CD together and it was worth the wait.  Unlike RCM where they rushed to put out the CD, you can hear the classic Duran Duran sound.  Mark Ronson brought out the best in the band whereas Timbaland just replaced the Duran sound with his beats.  I thought Astronaut was the best they have done since 1993 but this one is better.  I definitely miss Andy Taylor and his angry guitar riffs.  I hope Mark Ronson stays on board with Duran and crew in the future.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|This is a rough ride.  Not exactly a knee-slapper, no.  That's probably because this is astonishingly close to being accurate.  If aliens did arrive and we had any sort of advantage over them whatsoever, they would be exploited and subjugated by us.  This is science fiction that works.  It taps into the cultural zeitgeist and forces us to look at ourselves via a \\"what if\\" scenario.  The analogy to apartheid should be clear to anyone, with the aliens as stand-ins for the black population that is \\"ready to take up arms against their oppressors\\" to paraphrase Bono.  Humans even manufacture a derogatory term for the aliens (as we are so good at doing): \\"Prawns.\\"  And there is debate within the film as to whether or not it is proper to call them \\"Prawns,\\" with one government official defending the slur by saying, \\"Well let's face it, it's what they look like, isn't it?\\"  Indeed they are rather Lovecraftian in appearance.  It doesn't stop there.  The \\"Prawns\\" are reduced to eating cat food (even though they like it), there are horrendous medical experiments on them that amount to little more than torture (shades of Mengele), and an overall statement of \\"man's inhumanity to other living things.\\"  Usually in the name of a profit.  The film is left open to a sequel.  Should that come to pass, I would hope that the filmmakers include a bit of \\"prequel\\" as well, explaining who the Prawns are and how they came to us in such a disheveled state.  Make no mistake, this is a good film and quite worthy of its Best Picture nomination last year.  But don't ever expect it to be rollicking good, 'splodey sci-fi or some such drivel.  You'll be lucky to make it through without shedding a tear or turning away in revulsion at times.
B004GYY714|5.0|it has a lot of stations in different languages from all over the world. the categories are also great.  but the radio stream seems not always live.
0790729342|3.0|I've been on a kick lately of viewing films from my youth.  The Road Warrior is such a film.  I used to love it, the post-apocalyptic vibe combined with cars and trucks tricked out into mobile weapons.  In college, I even wrote a term paper on the entire Mad Max trilogy, discussing how it applies to the philosophies of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau.  You know, man reduced to a state of nature and then behaving little better than the lowest of animals, then inevitably forming new tribes, then communities out of the ashes.    Today, my affection for the film has waned.  Rest assured, I still believe it to be a fine piece of work with an artful and surreal atmosphere to it combined with kick ass action.  I just cannot enjoy it that much for it seems too close to becoming a reality for my tastes.  In the Mad Max films, there were wars that helped to ravage the globe and a nuclear exchange of one magnitude or another is alluded to.  Despite that, major reason cited for society's downfall is that the oil ran out.  We are perilously close to that today and...if I may be so bold...nearer to our own Mad Max scenario.  An additional reason for my dwindling affection for this film is...let's just say it involves a dog.  Yes, I used to love it.  It's easy to love a movie like this when you're 18 and have no one to worry for or protect besides yourself.  Addendum: Fans of Farscape will enjoy seeing Virginia Hey as a warrior woman.    It also occurred to me that the character of Mad Max may actually be saner than the real life Mel Gibson
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Not a fan of her voice or material. I still have a hard time understanding why so many people like this. Its just average to me.
B00000JSJC|3.0|I did not like this film when I first saw it in 1995.  Today, I have a greater appreciation for it.  The cyberpunk technology featured herein is becoming more and more plausible by the day.  Therefore, the types of market forces and criminal actions detailed in the film shall come in tandem with it.  An important subject for our society to take note of.  This film is not not without its problems.  The plot tends to meander, the focus on the dark side of human nature is rather unrelenting, and aspects of the ending are downright hokey.  Also, much of it is rooted in the Rodney King riots of 1992 in Los Angeles, seriously dating the narrative.  Balancing that out is the intriguing premise, the performance of Michael Wincott...a fine and menacing actor who was everywhere in the 90s and has sadly not appeared much since, and the neat allusions to the Gen-X, \\"slacker\\" worldview that is somewhat akin to Fight Club.  Not nearly in the same category as that latter film, but strains of similar undertones.   I kept wondering, why didn't I like this more back in the day?  After all, I didn't think I could have had a bleaker view of humanity than I did fifteen years ago, but I suppose I do.  And that is why I find Strange Days all the more realistic.

B000WGNLLW|2.0|I love Duran Duran.  Ever since 1983 they've been my heroes.    But this just didn't work for me.  I don't begrudge their wanting to work with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake.  That's part of what Duran is...never make the same record twice.  Risk taking is innate in the band.    Sometimes experiments fail.  My other favorite band, U2, had that experience with \\"Pop,\\" in my opinion.  They tried something.  It didn't really work.  Same goes for \\"Red Carpet Massacre.\\"    This is not to say that the record is without its positive moments.  \\"Falling Down\\" is great music.  The title track is edgy and raucous.  \\"Box Full Of Honey\\" is likewise good.  The rest just sounds like a bunch of guys trying to imitate hip hop.  As I said, I love Duran Duran.  I'd love to give them 5 stars for this.  But I'm afraid I have to give them 2.

B002VPE1AW|2.0|When this movie had its initial release, a good many jokes circulated about the Internet that it was merely a remake of Dances with Wolves or even Disney's vapid Pocahontas.  Nothing could have been truer.  If you have seen either of those flicks, you've seen Avatar.  There is nothing shocking about this movie.  Anyone with a few active brain cells can see what's coming at least a half hour ahead.  It's a Disney cartoon with really good animation.  Then there's the design of the Na'vi aliens.  Were they meant to be porn stars for the Furry fetish crowd?    Still, I've yet to see a James Cameron movie that is not without its merits.  The effects are groundbreaking and it does have decent messages about environmentalism, Eastern-styled spiritualism, and American greed and arrogance.  As I recall, this movie was rather lambasted by fundies and teabaggers post release for those very reasons.  Anything that can do that isn't all bad.  If you've got nothing else to do, you could watch worse than Avatar.  But if you really want my advice, skip this and go straight to District 9.
0760335540|5.0|This is as excellent that a DIY resource can get. Wayne already had a brilliant website pelicanparts.com with tons of technical information for DIYers like me. Putting all that information organized in a book was what one could hope. The book does far more than put  all that useful information together. The amazing color pictures and presentation makes it almost as good as a video.  Being an engineer at heart, I am not a big fan of just the repair manuals which is just saying how you take something apart and put back together. This book provides technical information that will tell you why you are doing what you are. Ofcourse you'll need other manuals as references but this book was a 'must-have' in my collection of tools.    Great work Wayne!  Thanks
B004RLPWXS|5.0|I know.  I know.  You'll say I'm biased.  I love Duran Duran and I'm going to gush all over the place about this album.  You're right.  It's 1983 all over again and that is by no means a bad thing.  This is their quintessential, signature sound.  Don't get me wrong, I've really enjoyed departures such as \\"Big Thing\\" and \\"Medazzaland.\\"  Those two records are in my all-time top ten.    But this...this...this is amazing.  My God, music is fun again! I never realized how much I missed this sound until it came back.  It's hard to pick just a few highlights, but \\"Runway Runaway\\" has been in my head for days now, \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\" sounds like \\"The Chauffeur\\" for the 21st. Century, and \\"Blame the Machines\\" is outstanding.  Seriously, every song is just bloody brilliant.  Kudos to Mark Ronson.  And if the boys in the band by any chance read these reviews, my offer to write your authorized biography still stands.  Unlike that other guy's, mine will be accurate.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Anything I say about this show will not do it justice.  It is well written, the cast clicks, the visuals are great, and who can forget all the T&A!  I'm not gonna lie, the action and nudity were what kept me watching every week, but the writing is still pretty good. The show is one of my guilty pleasures, when I watch I feel like I'm doing something wrong; it's a good feeling.
B00192IV9U|5.0|In the past decade MJ was not the household name he'd been since the 80's. I believe this is why this great album crawled under the radar.   I really enjoyed the music, been hummin that holywood song since I first heard it.     It's Sad to think that one with such musical genius, is gone....I highly recommend a spin thru this catalogue of songs. One time thru, and your hooked.    Mike B
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's angry birds. How could you go wrong? New pretty graphics and change of scenery make it stand out from the original/seasons.

0312600844|3.0|Our ladies book club chose Freedom on the recommendation of several spouses and adult daughters as well as the national hype. Only the single, childless member of the club actually liked the book, none of the rest of us cared for the close examination of someone else's tired, failed marriage. I slogged my way through this book only for the sake of the club. So why does it rate 3 stars? We hated reading it but loved talking about it! We actually discussed the book for 21/2 hours, a record for our club.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|English singer/songwriter PJ Harvey has released a number of great records since her classic debut, often changing her style and - aside from maybe Uh Huh Her - making sure that each record has its own identity. For her eighth proper studio record, the great Let England Shake, Harvey is changing things up more than ever, offering something of a new vocal style, a new focal instrument (the autoharp), some strange ornamentation (saxophones, you name it), and a very heavy and constant focus (war). All that said, this still somehow feels very much like a PJ Harvey record, offering all the bite and howl of her best work while giving the listener plenty to think about.    Long known not only for her howl, but also for her songwriting ability (see White Chalk or To Bring You My Love for proof), Harvey seems maybe more focused here than ever, admitting in the media that she spent quite a bit of time studying the history of conflict and war while writing her new record. And while its easy to listen to these 12 songs and think about things going on in the world today, most of the themes and concepts can be traced back through time, Harvey often referencing Anzac Cove, not Afghanistan. And while I do find the lyrics to be particularly interesting and even rewarding (Harvey supposedly spent over two years simply perfecting the lyrics with not instruments, but pen and paper), what I find most rewarding about this record are Harvey's arrangements and singing, which are as good here as ever.    It's not that I don't care about war or respect someone writing so elegantly about the evil of men (primarily in Europe, though I imagine it's hard for an American to hear the record and not feel like she's talking Bush and Obama), it's just that, well, I like music far more than I like war. War bums me out; music shoots straight to my mental state of well being in a way that nothing else can. The mixture of the two things, when you think about it, is strange; but, when done properly, it can work quite well. And while Harvey is often singing about sad history, you'd only know it if you paid close attention to her words with each spin - something I don't recommend. There's too much beauty in these often strange compositions to overlook. My theory is that, since Harvey, such a skilled album-maker at this point, took so long to pen these tunes, she very likely also had a whole lot of time to think about how she wanted to approach them in the studio. And so she came in with new voice, new sound and focused words, ready to record some of her most realized work ever.    Back when I was working in record stores I'd play Is This Desire? and, more than almost anything, Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea very, very often. Both albums had songs that appealed to me instantly, not unlike Let England Shake tracks such as \\"The Last Living Rose,\\" \\"England\\" and \\"The Words That Maketh Murder.\\" But, as I stuck with those two records, they revealed themselves to me in new ways, growing as I listened, eventually becoming front-to-back favorites. England is no different, once again proving Harvey as a true blue AOR-styled artist with some serious longevity.    Take an artist, any artist, with loads of great albums. Picture that catalog and all its high points. Now imagine me telling you that that very artist has yet to release their best record. Chances are, you wouldn't believe me. I wouldn't believe me. But here we have PJ Harvey who, after two decades of releasing great - even classic, in some cases - records, has released what could very likely go down as her signature record. It's the music. It's the singing. It's the writing. It's the strange ornamentation. Everything comes together here to form a solid, memorable work that ups the ante for anyone trying to make a serious album made to move and inspire. That the backdrops are also so unique and cool is one hell of a bonus.    Check out more of my reviews at [...]
B003EYVXTG|5.0|'Winter's Bone' is the best fiction film I saw in 2010.  [I put the 'fiction' qualifier in there because my favorite film overall was Lucy Walker's [[ASIN:B004CJQVQC Waste Land]], a documentary.]  'Bone' deserved its Oscar nominations and Spirit Award wins.  There's a grittiness and realness present in this film that's lacking from a lot of Hollywood product.  Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini's outstanding screenplay - adapted from Daniel Woodrell's superb novel of the same name - indelibly documents the extent of the impact that the methamphetamine epidemic has had on rural communities.  It does that not only in terms of rendering the primary circle of addiction in stark relief, but also by depicting the wider, secondary circles of mistrust, paranoia and broken families it engenders.<br /><br />Director/co-writer Granik has tabbed an outstanding set of actors to depict this flat, colorless, frightening world.  It's now well-documented that Jennifer Lawrence shocked the daylights out of everyone with her performance as Ree.  Anyone who says they saw that coming is fabricating.  Excellent screenplay and direction notwithstanding, Bone's make-or-break rests on Ms. Lawrence's shoulders.  To say she nailed it is an understatement.  She buried that nail so deep, she shot right to the very heart of the Hollywood A-List.  To this viewer, it's clear that Lawrence's performance was enhanced greatly by the great work of John Hawke.  His 'Teardrop' is the single best thing about this uniformly excellent production.  Ree and Teardrop on the screen together make for the film's standout scenes.<br /><br />That's only topped by whatever scenes Dale Dickey appears in.  She's the first line of defense in local kingpin Thump Milton's rings of protection.  In countenance, physique and cadence, Ms. Dickey is pitch-perfect in every way.  She's downright menacing.  Her part in bringing Ree's quest to a very undeniable finality is not something you'll easily forgot.  She won an Independent Spirit award for her portrayal.  It was both well deserved and well awarded.r her portrayal.  It was both well deserved and well awarded.
0307341550|5.0|I loved this book.  It was so dark and creepy that I couldn't put it down, but I didn't want to read it either.  The story is terrible in a fantastic way.  It was hard to read, but harder to put down.  The characters so flawed, so damaged, that they draw you in and don't let go.  I worry about the mental health of the author.  I read this book right after it came out and I still find myself thinking about it.  Gillian Flynn is able to create characters so awful and so compelling that you can't help but be afraid that there may be real people walking around like them.
B004SBX112|5.0|They are all great games... each offers something different. This has so many themed holiday levels. It is just incredible. I love an ad free version and supporting the developers.
0307341577|4.0|I really liked this book it was dark and you didn't really root for anyone, but I liked that.  Sometimes books are too cut and dry, to all tied up in a pretty little bow.  This isn't one of those books.  It's dark, it's creepy, it makes you wonder about the authors sanity.  It felt real.

B0018OAPAW|4.0|I held off buying this one for a while. Two years infact. I have all the other Offpring albums before it, but their decline in quality onver recent efforts, I decided to save my money instead.  I liked but didn't love the first single, Hammerhead. The followup singles (Kristy, Gonna Go Far and Half Truism) were great but given the best songs from the past few albums have been the singles and the remainder of the tracks had been well below par, I wasn't going the get burnt.  How silly am I. I've missed out on two years of listening to an album full of awesome songs!!  This is their best effort since Ixnay.  There are none of the silly, childish, \\"funny at the time but you seriously wouldn't listen to them other than to laugh or cringe\\" tracks like almost each album before contains at least one of.   From start to finish this album beats any of their post Ixnay releases.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are by far the most comfortable headphones I have found.  My only complaint is that after owning several pair of these, I have found you have to be very careful with throwing them into your gym back because the plastic portion can get pulled, twisted, and eventually loosen the wires, so you lose sound in 1 ear or both.
B004SSCWYC|2.0|So now she has her ex-boyfriend, all the memories and knowledge of her alter-ego and Mr. Spock inside her head? Must be getting a bit crowded in there.   Honestly this show is getting a bit silly.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|An absolutely astonishing film--astonishing only because I'm astonished by the number of people who thought it was good. I can only assume that they read the gushing critical reviews and decided that all this pulp romance/horror/'suspense' must be Art. And psychological. Yup, if you don't \\"get it\\" you must not Understand the Deep, Deep, Psychology.    It was one cliche after another; there wasn't an original thought in it. My husband and I kept saying, OK, next there's going to be a...lesbian scene! And there it was. OK, next there's going to be...Etc. etc. etc., right up to; and now we're going to find out that it's all in her head...oh yeah, here it comes.    My advice: if you're still smoking Sobranies and reading dark poetry, and believe that angst is the natural human condition, and think that uptight women just need a good rogering unless oops, it loosens them up but sends them over the edge, you'll love it. If you read a lot and watch plenty of good movies, you'll loathe it.    I got it. I just thought it was unutterably trite.
B004L49K20|5.0|Well, the 1st single/title track not so much, but the rest of the album is eerily similar to their classic 1982 new wave masterpiece!  This is exactly how I want my Duran Duran!!- The spirit, energy, fun & glamor are back in the music, thanks to super-producer/old-school DD fan Mark Ronson.  Almost every song here recalls the band's glory days of the first 3 albums.  Catchy choruses, disco-rock beats, plucky bass lines, and lush electronics fill nearly every one of the 15 tracks here.  Here's a run-down of the new stuff that did NOT appear on I-tunes back in December:    \\"A Diamond In The Mind\\" and \\"Return To Now\\" are very brief orchestral snippets of \\"All you Need Is Now,\\" so don't be disappointed when you realize these are not proper new songs.  Gorgeous orchestration, however!    \\"Other People's Lives\\", \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\" & \\"Networker Nation\\" are all upbeat, dance-rock additions that fit well with the original 9 tracks.  Good songs!    \\"Mediterranea\\" is a nice breezy, tropical, mid-tempo ballad that was recently released on an EP overseas.    \\"Too Close To The Sun\\" & \\"Early Summer Nerves\\" are the official \\"bonus\\" tracks and are more experimental in nature.  Not as catchy or bouncy as most other tracks, but certainly make for an interesting listen.    The accompanying DVD is a terrific add-on- however, if you're like me & visit the band's website often, you've probably seen nearly all of its content already.  The track by track production commentary gives great insight into the band's songwriting method!  The ONLY complaint I can possibly make about this deluxe package is the album art.  I'm not sold on the cover photo  & I'm disappointed that there are NO band photos anywhere in the entire package.  As good as the guys look at 50+ years old, I would think they would want to show their faces somewhere on the album.  Aside from that, I couldn't be happier to see my life-long favorite band return to their glory, 30 years after their very first album!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|When it comes to these kinds of stories there is always the danger that they will come across as a bad imitation of a blockbuster book. Not so with this one. I loved the story and eagerly await the sequel. Yes, it's made for a sequel.
0385341679|5.0|As a fan of the Darkfever series, this final chapter of MacKayla Lane's world of dark fae mysteries had been much anticipated. And as a reader, one tries to keep expectations at bay for lack of disappointment. Shadowfever, although a bit slow-going in the beginning for me, took hold of my mind, shook it like a rabid dog that wouldn't let go and kept me riveted to the very end. And let me elaborate..the reason the beginning was slow for me was simply because I found it depressing, therefore harder to get into, not due to the lack of writing. Once I surged forward and more light was found in the dark, I couldn't put the book down. There were times my over-indulged brain needed a break from it all, only to pick it back up again minutes later. And that, is telling of a good read. I do enjoy Ms. Moning's writing in this series as it doesn't sugarcoat or forgive easily and the characters are as strong as they are decidedly precise. I think that's what makes even her most loathsome character likable. I was just as excited at the end as I was in the beginning and I desperately hope this isn't the last we hear of Mac and her Fae World.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I picked the book off the shelf never having read the Kite Runner but tempted by the many positive reviews here. I was not disappointed!  The story sucks you and the characters seem too real. I throughly empathized with the two lead characters making me realise how brutally difficult it is to be a woman in some communities. It was a very easy book to read despite the references to Afghan culture and poets who I'm not familiar with, it was difficult to put down the book and I read it in 2 days flat.   Look forward to reading more from this author
B001P06GX4|5.0|From reading the description of this game online I was a little confused what they meant by only allowing pieces to touch at the corners because it wasn't readily apparent to me that most of the pieces consist of multiple joined squares in various configurations (think tetrus). Having said that, once you see the game the rules are quite simple and can be learned in a few minutes. Adults can play a challenging game, but 2 adults can readily play with 2 kids because the adults will focus on blocking each other in and hence the [ignored] kids could well end up winning. Best with 4 players, but 2 works pretty well too.      Caveats: the playing pieces are bit flimsy, so kids who aren't careful could break some pieces, but replacement pieces are easily (and cheaply) available. Also, the scoring rules are a bit more complex than the playing rules, so when we play with kids we just say whoever is the last one able to make a move is the winner (and 2nd last one gets 2nd place, etc).
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This is a legitimate one-star review that did NOT come from an AT&amp;T user or from someone outside the USA.  I'm not staying signed in to my Amazon.com account to use an app from the Amazon App Store.  Google doesn't require that of us for the Android Market.  This reeks of Apple's business model, which I purposely avoided by going with Android in the first place.  All that aside, why is Amazon acting like it's such a great deal to get Angry Birds for free?  Again, this isn't an Apple device -- all Angry Birds episodes are free for Android users!

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|It's a real blessing that I started listening to REM when they released \\"Up\\". It's a blessing because, since I missed \\"Murmer\\" and \\"Automatic for the People\\", I don't know what and REM album is \\"supposed\\" to sound like. I was 15, and \\"Up\\" seemed like it was made just for me at that time in my life. Now, 13 years later, this album feels the same way. I haven't been with them every step of the way (we parted ways at \\"Reveal\\"), but I always listened to each album to see \\"Are they back with me?\\" That means there was only one REM album that came out at a time where I could appriciate it right in that moment. With this album, I guess we're back together as it seems to have the sames temporal, emotional appropriateness as \\"Up\\" did. As for the recording techniques, it does not have the soft, dynamic qualities that are missed by so many, but something about the surprisingly relevant post-modernity of the album makes that OK. For a band in its 31st year, I could not ask for more.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This app does not work properly on my Acclaim. None of the text and the cut scenes dont load properly. When on the first stage, I can't move the screen. Rio does work, and i haven't tried any of the other Angry Birds.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|\\"The Day After\\" has gone on to be one of the most successful television movies of all-time, garnering two Emmy wins, and holding a place in television history as being one of the most realistic telefilms ever made. Depicting the after effects of a nuclear war against the United States from the Soviet Union the movie is hair-raising, intelligently written, and wonderfully produced.<br /><br /> Originally airing in November, 1983 on ABC the film led to multiple discussions at the time of its release with teachers wanting their students to watch in anticipation of talking about the story content of the film, if such a war could happen, and if it did what would people do?<br /><br /> The made-for-TV movie was theatrically released abroad where it became a box office hit.<br /><br /> The film stars Jason Robards and Jobeth Williams.

The artwork is beautiful and I would love to get the complete collection for my kids as we all love looking at the pictures and learning a little about the world (although of course this book is 'of its time' so things have changed somewhat since it was written)
B003INBNXO|5.0|LOVED this movie. Excellent fight scenes made better with Donnie Yen. If you loved \\"Fearless\\" you will love this film. I enjoyed it a bit more than fearless because it has less of the whole fake ass flying around crap. Overall great story + great action = excellent movie. BUY it NOW.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God is a fun reworking of the old computer game Alchemy, where you added two elements together to create new things. The game is simple but addictive and has a very strong \\"gotta find em all\\" component. The thing I like about this version is the nice graphics and simple interface.
B002ZG99TA|2.0|So this film is literally all about a runaway train. That's pretty much it. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine's characters spend the last half hour of the film trying to be heros and stop the train all by themeselves in their own little train, going backwards. Oh and of course there are dangerous chemicals onboard the runaway train and of course it is heading towards a highly populated city where it will surely run off the track if no one stops it and disintegrate everything in the area. Oh, there's a pointless subplot about how Pine's character has a restraining order and can't see his son and wife and of course Washington's character has a small issue with his two daughters too. I'm pretty sure I covered the entire movie. That really is it. Zero suspense, predictable ending and can't forget the cliché characters!
0307593495|5.0|I've been a longtime fan of the Wallander TV series but this is the first of the books that I've read. I can't explain why--it just happened. My loss. I will have to go back to the beginning and read all the books now. I was deeply impressed by The Troubled Man. It is dense and terribly real--the characters jump off the pages and behave in very real ways: with anger and indignation and curiosity, with fondness and despair. The depiction of the onset of Alzheimer's is powerfully affecting. Wallander will stay in my mind, and in my sympathy. (As a point of interest, Kenneth Brannagh does a sterling job as Wallander in the British TV production. Until I read this book, I didn't realize just how faithful his performance is to Mankell's creation.) I admired and enjoyed this book--for its historical/political elements, and for its labyrinthine plot. Whether or not you've ever read any of the books in this series, be certain to read this one. My highest recommendation.
0670022411|2.0|Fortunately I obtained this with my montly credit on Audible.      I found the plot to be slow and unengaging, and the characters not well developed.    I see most of the readers at amazon gave it a 4+ stars, so it seems most enjoyed it, and that probably explains the high rating on Audible as well.      I won't be reading any further installments of the trilogy.

B0000AKCLS|5.0|Reading all the reviews I see that some people have a problem in his style of playing. Well, what do you expect? He grew up listening to BB,SRV, Albert King and other Blues greats. As a guitar player, I understand this young man's style. I've seen him on youtube and the kid is just awesome! Started very young and has played in many venues around the world. Guitar players his age WILL go through life experiences,the good and the bad. In time, his style will change some because of life. For now, he is the next best thing to SRV and I'm loving every bit of him!

B004JAUCOQ|5.0|this album is really beautiful to listen to.  the guitar work is softer but still has j's signiture sound which translates well with the acoustic.  the lyrics are were this album really shines.  while dinosaur albums always carry a well written ambigious narrative they tend to be over shadowed by j's ability to shred a nasty rift.  the acoustic guitar's gentleness allows his lyrics to surface as the dominate sonic element.  the album reveals a pretty human experience i think most people who like this genre of music can relate to and has some beautifully candid lines (i've been waiting for an answer but the question takes too long... )  i'm totally biased, i love everything this guy makes and could listen to him bang on guitar strings until i'm deaf, but i was cautious about the acoustic guitar /singer /song writer spiel.   its really a great album with great album art and something i'll be listening to for a while.
1439152780|2.0|I have loved all the other books by this author. But this one is painful to get through. It's been three months and I have only gotten half way because nothing seems to happen and I don't care about the characters. Ugh.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|When you try to \\"buy\\" Angry Bird Rio and your credit card is from a country outside of the US you get the following message:    \\"We could not process your order because of geographical restrictions on the product which you were attempting to purchase.\\"    The Android store is supposed to be available in many countries beside the US! How can we get this game if Amazon is the exclusive distributor and it won't take international order?    This is a huge let down from Amazon and Rovio and show a distressing lack of respect from these companies for their international customers. This behavior is unaceptable.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|very cool. I use it for doing wireless labs for class much easier than carrying a laptop around. works better than i expected. definitely recommended.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|A solid sequel to Angry Birds. However, I strongly disagree with their decision to publish the ad-free version *only* through Amazon, and including DRM that won't allow me to continue to use the game if I log out of Amazon Appstore. This type of DRM makes my purchase into a rental, since without a constant connection to Amazon, I can't keep the game I thought I was buying. Also, for an ad-free version, there are a lot of images in the game I'd consider ads.  Angry Birds started out as a great game at a small company, but lately I really question their business decisions. This is not how I'm used to being treated by indie developers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game! very addicting. passes the time at work or anywhere! if you enjoy the other angry birds games you'll like this on too . enjoy
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Improved graphics and fps performance. The backgrounds look more detailed &amp; lush. Why anyone would complain is beyond me. I guess the unfamiliar characters would be the only defect.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|In my opinion the graphics are better then the other angry bird games. It has another 7 or 8 levels to go. It is just the best game ever.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I would have paid .99 cents for you NOT to tell me this was available. I've tried off and on for 2 days to install on HTC Desire.  Getting not enough space.  Freed up 40MB... basically removed all my installed programs and still won't install.
1596680199|5.0|I'm really new to the polymer clay and I did a lot of researching before starting this craft.  I have looked through a lot of books and I can truly say that this one is my favorite so far.  It provides provides detail information on many different techniques that you can use on many different beads.  I like the fact that is dedicated to beads and not other crafts that I'm not interested in.  I can truly say that I'm glad I made the purchase and it was well worth it.  If there any more books out there that compare to this one please let me know.  Thank you!
B000GW8OXC|5.0|Is it just me, or is the second vinyl louder than the first one? I'm not talking about \\"loudness wars\\" or clipping. Just plain volume. I had my amplifier at 46 for the first one. Then I put the second one and 5 minutes later I realized my ears were hurting because it was too loud in my headphones. And it wasn't just because I was listening for too long. So strange... Anyone else experience this?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw this book pop up from time to time but never had any interest. I needed a book to read and read one or two reviews (no spoilers) so I only had a vague sense of what the book was about. Well once I started reading I just could not put it down I needed to find out what happened, who made it, who didnt and why. The book pulls you in very quickly and keeps you in very easily. I already downloaded the second and third books into my Kindle. Cant wait to start reading Catching Fire.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|so far! seems to be more fun for me at least. graphics are still good, and there are a couple more variables with the swinging lamps.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The graphics are wonderful, new characters, the ultimate Angry Birds game. I have had no problems with this download. It is the best one yet.
0670022411|3.0|(Spoiler Alert!)  It took me a while to get into the book. then i wanted to see what was going to happen. Characters are pretty good--but writing is uneven somehow. And then at the end when they are going to time-travel----i said OMG---now she is sticking in the \\"Voyager\\"(Outlander) plots in here also. i might read the 2nd book cause i think the period of history that they are going to will be interesting......but i won't put the book at the top of my list.
B004GF244K|5.0|What could possibly be bad about Clapton, McCartney, and Jeff Lynne living a couple of hours on stage with George's music?  Nothing, it is amazing.  Oh yes, and the other participating musicians are merely spectacular.    Words fail.  It is so wonderful in so many repects.  Get it, turn it up, love it.  My Sweet George, not all things must pass if you have left a loving memory ... and Dhani too.

B004J4WQ46|3.0|I've been a Strokes fan since day one.  When they took a 5 year hiatus after their third record, however, I could totally understand why. The Strokes \\"sound\\" is a very specific one; a catchy melody dancing over interlocking guitar riffs and a drum machine-esque beat.  Very specific also means very limited.  The Strokes were trapped in a box.    So here we are, 5 years later, with an album that even the band themselves seem unsure of.  Check out current interviews with Julian and Nick and you'll find quotes along the lines of \\"yeah I like it, but there's a lot of things I wouldn't have done.\\" and \\"i feel we have a better album in us.\\"  The first quote, by Julian, is reflecting on the fact that this time around, all five members had equal say in calling the shots and writing the songs. And it shows in both a good and bad way.    The bad, is that the other members of this band are simply not as talented songwriters as Julian.  99% of the material by this band has been written by Julian. Fans may love the entire band, but its Julian's songwriting that is the foundation for it all. I'll admit that certain tracks on here written by the others are better than I'd expect, but none of them are going to hit you like \\"12:51\\" or \\"Last Nite\\" did. There are also a few songs I don't think should have made the record.    The good, is that it seems evident that Julian's band members pushed to try out some new sounds.  Despite the fact that the lead single sounds like classic Strokes, theres a lot of stuff on here that really feels like new territory. I was so surprised that the production style on \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" actually worked for the band. It made me really happy, because even though the song isn't a 10/10, I felt like I finally heard The Strokes coming out of their little box while still sounding GOOD.    This review might sound a little harsh, but I think it has to be.  With all five members writing and putting their ideas on the table, this is in every way a brand newStrokes, a Strokes that even the band themselves aren't quite sure of just yet.  Some ideas really worked well, some of them fell a bit flat. Regardless, it's very good to finally hear from this band again.  I feel they have some great albums ahead of them, and this is the first step in figuring out how to make them a reality.

1439102724|3.0|MAJOR spoilers below. You have been warned:<br /><br />Although I have never read Picoult's work and always viewed her a fluff fiction writer, I am glad that I gave this book a chance, because she bravely confronts such a deeply controversial issue. Her greatest strengths in this novel lie in the characters of Zoe and Vanessa. Both women are deeply sympathetic, but they have their flaws, too. Piccoult never depicts these women and their allies as saints.<br /><br />With that said, the remaining cast show up poorly against these two strong characters. Max, for example, is very shallow. All he does is parrot his pastor and allow himself to be emotionally manipulated by his friends. Although I did sympathize with him at first when Zoe seemed to place childbearing above their marriage, he became increasingly difficult to relate to later on as he lost all semblance of independent thought. To be fair, I experienced the same level of disconnection with Zoe's lawyer, Angela Moretti. At first, I liked her sense of humor and felt that she would make a great advocate for Zoe, but was disappointed to see her take cheap shots at Max and his lawyer, Wade Preston. There were many instances in which she applied sound logic to refute Preston's arguments, and I believe she should have stayed on that high road instead of resorting to school yard taunts.<br /><br />Finally, although the surprise ending was beautiful and appropriate, the epilogue left more questions than it answered. For instance, Picoult implies that Max and his brother's wife, Liddy, eventually got married. I am wondering how they accomplished this since Liddy and Max's brother Reid are conservative Christians who probably wouldn't believe in divorce.. I can't imagine that Reid would let his wife go without a fight, nor can I imagine Max sabotaging his relationship with the brother that he loved. Piccoult should have explored the outcome of these relationships more thoroughly.<br /><br />Despite its flaws in plot and character, I still enjoyed this book. I liked the author's writing style and her fully realized, nuanced depiction of the day to day interactions between Zoe and Vanessa (although I do feel that the relationship moved too fast). While I wish Picoult had kept a slower pace near the end, I commend her for her sensitive portrayal of a hot button issue.I liked the author's writing style and her fully realized, nuanced depiction of the day to day interactions between Zoe and Vanessa (although I do feel that the relationship moved too fast).

B004SBS8LA|5.0|another great angry birds game from rovio mobile! its also really disappointng tht people are rating an individual game based on problems with the amazon app store. It wasnt as simple as a one click download but i thought amazon provided appropriate instructions and it works fine. PLUS THE APP IS FREE! Not only is it a great game but its at NO COST TO YOU!
B003OWVHVC|5.0|I had only heard a few Aloe Blacc songs before purchasing this cd and I'm so glad I did.  Aloe Blacc's Good Things offers a fresh spin on older soul music.  He has a mature sound but still manages to keep his music young and modern and mixes up funk, soul, and old-school Motown.  There is a nice variety of instruments on the album and I find myself listening to the cd in its entirety, not just one or two songs on repeat as I do with some cd's.  He does a great job of bringing back soul music to a younger crowd.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|loving the new scenes...the monkeys...freeing the birds...can't wait to see what all this has in store for me as i pass different levels! the colors are bright and vivid!

0670022411|2.0|Well I am 3/4 of the way through and I am about to just give up. The bare bones of the story are interesting enough to have gotten me this far, but I am so sick of the main character's fainting, acting like a baby, and being \\"scooped up\\" by the vampire.  I think the main character Diana is pretty weak and there are just too many cliches going on. Not sure if I'm going to finish- the story seems pretty predictable at this point..
B003Y74KC0|5.0|I prefer semi-soft cases like this, they seem to take shape better to the iphone. great little case, no complaints.
B00000269J|4.0|[[ASIN:B001QITO52 Momentary Lapse of Reason]]  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who have reveiwed this record negatively.  Yes, it has a more 80's sound than other records they released before it.  They had to stay with the times to garner new listeners who might buy this record, like it, and then go back and buy some of their earlier records.  So if you were looking for a Dark Side 2, then look somewhere else.  If you want some good music by a group who, in my opinion, consistantly put out good records that you'll listen to more than once, then buy this record.  You will give it repeated listens and like it more with each listen.  I guarantee it.  It's not their best record.  If you want their best, buy Dark Side and The Wall and stop there.  Especially if you are just a casual listener.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I woke up fairly late in life to Rush. Having played guitar in a straight ahead rock band from the mid 70s to early 90s, I didn't think Rush was worth a real listen. My wife and son were Rush fans, but I was a rock snob and somehow ignored this amazing band. Then one night I caught a piece of this documentary on TV and suddenly realized what a fool I had been. I quickly ordered the DVD and have watched it almost every night since it arrived. It certainly is the best documentary I have ever seen, music orientated or otherwise. I was struck by the genius of their creativity and the integrity they manifest in all aspects of their work and lives. Their openness and honesty is clearly demonstrated in this movie. It is so refreshing to see these three guys take their music very seriously and themselves not at all. They obviously love what they do, love each other even after all these years and are still having a damn good time. Get this DVD, you won't regret it. Warning, if you never cared much for Rush, prepare to have your mind altered.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice game runs perfectly on Samsung Galaxy S. Installed quickly without any problems . This twenty five word minimum is a real pain and will greatly reduce the number of reviews that I will post here.

0345505387|3.0|I never read any of the Outlander series but I wanted to read the book because I saw beautiful artwork. The artwork was indeed very beautiful. Soft, ethereal, fantasy, with very pretty faces, bodies. The \\"look\\" of the characters is very erotic, very sexy,  without actually revealing any nudity. However the story was very confusing and to me, seemed like a mess. Why on earth would a girl from the 1940's marry a Scot \\"brother\\" from the 1700's? It's totally unrealistic that she would willing fall into a wedding after a major \\"hangover.\\" I definitely feel like a lot of pieces were cut out and disconnected and that the story should have been better written.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|The resolution of blue ray is really much better than normal DVD. A single blue ray shall be worthy of that price. But the accompanied DVD is just an extra desert of a full dinner.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game already finished with all the levels available so far.  and that includes all the bananas and pineapples.excellent job on all 3 games.  I em hope the new levels come out a little quicker than the calendar time that the game displays.
0307593495|4.0|First thing I want to say about when I review books.  I don't read the synopsis for fear of getting information that might give something away.  So subsequently my reviews will very rarely detail specifics and deal more in generalities.    I liked what I felt was a more gritty and depressing tone set by Mankell, than previous books.  But at the same time one aspect of the story made me very uncomfortable and hard to get through and in some way felt it detracted from the story.  It appears that Mankells current style reflects the more gritty and graphic trend where writers seem bent on trying to outdo each other in graphic details.      Once I really settled in to the book and my initial discomfort lessened, the book really started to shine in typical Mankell fashion.  Mankell fans will read the book regardless of what reviews say and those new to Mankell really should start at the beginning with \\"Faceless Killers\\".
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Well I had problems at first, I couldn't get it to download and kept getting an error message.  I looked through the reviews to see what I could do, and I tried hooking up my phone to the computer.  I was about to go through the steps regarding deleting the bad files but thought I would try it one more time. It downloaded and installed just fine without having to go through all the suggested steps.  It's a bit easier than the other angry birds but still fun.  My 6 yr old will love it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this bag.  I previously had a Lowepro that my business partner bought me, which is a nice bag, but for me it was overly bulky and only had space for one body with a couple of lenses.  Not to mention, it was heavy, before you put anything in it.  When we obtained our second bodies and I ended up with yet another lens, I started looking for a bag in which I could get ALL of my camera equipment - that is very important to me, even if I don't plan on using my second body (it's for backup purposes), I want it all together where I know where everything is.    In my bag I have the two Nikon bodies, one with 18-105mm lens attached, and, if I can remember everything, the following: 3 more lenses, flash (unfolded), extra TTL cord, chargers for both cameras and a AA charger, extra batteries (4 camera, 20 AA), extra SD cards, cleaning kit, roll of Velcro, camera to computer cable x2, and probably more.  On the outside, on what I assume is meant for the tripod, I have my bracket with TTL cord and flash diffuser dome.    I have not noticed any problems with quality at this point, like some other reviewers have mentioned.  I am hoping what happened to them was just a fluke.  Also unlike some other reviewers, I am able to wear this backpack just fine - I am NOT a small girl, either.  I admit it, I'm overweight, but the backpack is not tight at all.    I love that the backpack keeps a smaller size yet has good padding for my equipment.  My only thing is it likes to fall over if you try to stand it up but I'll bet that's caused by my bracket hanging on the outside.  It's not a big deal to lean it or lay it down flat.      Of course, if I have problems I will come back and update my review but so far so good, I couldn't be happier.  Even if this bag fell apart in a couple of years, I'd probably figure I wore it out and I would get another one of the same.

B000001E3V|5.0|This recording shreds.  One of his best bands and definitely some of his best solos.  My only complaint is they should never have included an alternate version of Let It Rain.  The version of Let It Rain on the 1970s release is EC's best non-bootlegged solo ever!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great graphics, definitely better than other versions, just as entertaining if not more.  Addictive nonetheless, once you compete a level you'll push yourself to finish the game. Gor it free with the Appstore daily free paid apps. Enjoy!
B001W6RRNY|5.0|Fascinating book and no coincidence that we still talk about it 17 years after it was published.  While some reviewers are criticising that not all companies in the study continue to be successful I think they both miss the point and did not read the author's claims carefully.  They study a group of companies which was exceptionally successful during the observation period. This neither implies that these companies will continue to do well nor does it prevent us to learn from their past experiences.   What is more of a challenge for the book is the mind frame in which it was written. Authors' are not able to fully escape the main debates of their time (and they probably should not). For `Built to Last' that means substantial space being devoted to vision and mission (hotly debated in the 1990s). I recommend that you also read `Enduring Success: what we can learn from the history of outstanding corporations' - a new book that picks up topics we care about today (e.g. innovation versus execution), using the same research approach as `Built to Last'.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|This CD rocks.  I honestly expected more of a country feel to it, but most tracks strike me as closer to blues or rock with some giving me a dash of honkey-tonk. The disc is great and in performance the songs from this album are even better.  We saw him Monday night, and the unfamiliar songs prompted me to buy this.  My favorites so far are The Last Matador of Bayonne, Dust Bowl & Prisoner.  The liner notes include, \\"10 years, 10 albums and ...[a] wonderful group of fans\\" (add one more since I dragged my sister into DeVos Hall and made her a convert based on some of these songs).  Keep 'em coming Joe-As much as I like your older stuff, your style shifts make your new music really new instead of a tired old retread of a popular disc.
0399536108|4.0|If you like to buck the norm and take risks, this is the book for you.  Some of the thinking is quite simple, but Chris does a good job of getting into some alternative ways of thinking what \\"wealth\\" really is.  It makes you give a long, hard look at your situation and begs the question \\"are you happy where you are at?\\"<br /><br />A great read for anyone in business who is in a rut.  Simple, easy to follow, but informative.  If you are set in your ways and don't like change, then perhaps this book isn't good for you.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Hello! I've been wanting Star Trek the Next Generation for some time now, and I finally made the leap and bought the complete series. I review it as a good purchase, especially if you like Star Trek, or SciFi in general. The first two seasons take a while to get going, but by the third season it is pretty awesome. The only Con I can think of for this item is that with seven seasons to buy, $320 is steep! All the pluses make up for that though.  Happy Trekking!
B000M341QE|5.0|This is a remarkably good film. First, it keeps your interest from start to finish. The characters are quite good and the pace is consistent. There is no room for reflection unless you watch it again and you can watch this film repeatedly. I saw The Gangs of New York but The Departed is so much better. If you liked No Country for Old Men, you'll like The Departed. In both films the characters learn that there are no clean getaways. In this film the story ends when a bent cop finds a former cop in his apartment who promptly executes him. Undoubtedly the former cop received a copy of the tape between the crime boss and his rat and took justice into his own hands.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|I have to agree with other reviewers who found this volume a bit dull in comparison to the others.  I would have preferred it if A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons were one volume, as the author originally intended.  While I enjoyed the changing POV in the first 3 books, it was not as successful here with the limited character set.  It feels like Martin has sacrificed concise storytelling for repetition just to fill the pages.  I kept losing focus and it took me as long to finish this book as it did any of the earlier, and much longer, ones.    He either has killed off characters I liked or left out their stories until the next book and introduced a bunch more that I couldn't quite bring myself to care about.  I hope the next book is a major improvement, because it will probably take years before we see the end of the series.   Not sure I will care anymore if the next is like this one.    And why has Cersei become such an idiot?  Is it not possible to be paranoid without being an utter fool?  The change in her character strains credulity and since so much of this book is devoted to her POV, it pulls you out of the story and leaves you scratching your head.  There have been a couple of plot devices in earlier books as well that are a bit far-fetched but this is the worst.

B004H1YH66|5.0|I've been a fan of this score since the 1st version, waaaaaay back on cassette tape.....lol......This is without a doubt the best version I've heard.  With all the cut cues, and some additional included here you cant go wrong.  If you have always enjoyed the original score before, and played it 1000 x's over like myself, then you have got to pick this up!!!!!!!  This is the best score poledouris ever wrote, possibly one of the best scores any composer has ever wrote period.  If you love powerful, triumphant, drama driven scores, do yourself a favour and buy this, it is worth every scent.
B0015R9K2G|5.0|This book may get some history buffs upset due to some events or peoples being left out, but I assure you that this book spans many different cultures, peoples, ideas, and events that are representitive of how humanity has changed. When I saw this book I thought it would read like my history textbook, but it is very different. With all the most important things of humanity tha can be fit in these so many pages, this book is a enjoyable read with a delightful narrator and a basic outline of the history of humanity. 10/10

It would be nice if it was some kind of way you could record your score with Friends...

B004LSJCJM|5.0|For his 10th album, Joe has sort of gone the old \\"Carlos Santana\\" route to get worldwide attention (not that he needed it). Glenn Hughes makes a cameo on the record to attract the ROCK crowd. Joe attracts the country crowd by getting Vince Gill to come in for a track. Combine these musical juggernauts with Joe's gigantic \\"living legend\\" guitar tone... and you have the same recipe Santana had on his Supernatural album that won all of those Grammy awards.<br /><br />The REST of the album does NOT fail to impress. Recorded in short time, Joe does his best recording yet. Anyone \\"new\\" to Joe could start with this album... anyone who likes Joe would be comfortable with this as a new album... although it's a very polished yet off the cuff blues album. BLUES. Plenty of face melting solos, and amazing clear vocal melodies. Joe's voice is better on the album than any previous.<br /><br />Another MAJOR plus: his songs on this album tell stories vs. \\"my baby done left me\\" typical ho-hum blues.<br /><br />The only accomplishment Joe has yet to capture is the attention of the Recording Academy. Joe has topped the Billboard Blues Charts more than most artists in the category with his last four albums, yet ironically he has yet to be nominated for a Blues Grammy. Will Dust Bowl BE that album?
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Although I did not purchase this from amazon, I feel this will be helpful. I was very disapointed in the quality of this recording format. I kept asking myself is this how grainy this picture is. It does not fit the new BD quality period. I have dvd's that look better then this BD copy on my same player. Before you purchase this google reveiws for this BD saphire series. There are even some threads that have rumors of Paramount offering a free limited exchange for this disc. Dont waste your money untill they re-record this in the newest highest BD standards.

Pigs are out and so far caged birds and monkeys are in.

B004G6009U|5.0|A fun film that has entertained both my family and customers of all ages passing through my store. The Disney BD did not disappoint on quality and value for the price, albeit several features are worth skipping.<br /><br />The picture quality is as expected - virtually flawless and very colorful. The 7.1 DTS is great, though most of the outer channel usage was with Maximus and the dam breaking, still worthwhile to have the extra two speakers going though. The supplements are a mixed bag and include:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 3 @ 12:36 minutes. Directors intro for each, all still in the sketch mode. Nothing worth watching unless you like the rough draft edits.<br />* Original Storybook Openings, 2 versions @ 8 minutes. Both with intros, and both providing only a couple tidbits of additional details.<br />* 50th Feature Countdown, 2 minutes. Way too fast as they show a brief clip from each film accompanied by a number but no titles. Even pausing each one for customers to guess was not enough - too quick and not enough info.<br />* Extended Song Sequences, 2 @ 7:48 minutes. The \\"Life Begin\\" and \\"Mother Knows Best\\" songs, mixed in with sketch and CGI animation to show the extensions, glad they were cut down.<br />* Untangled, making of, 12:27 minutes. Hosted by Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. Shows some decent background on the production process mixed in with trivia and lots of cheese by those two as they try to provide some painful laughs. Not sure what the target audience was as I liked some of the information (that might bore kids) but their comedy attempts were horrible.<br />* Tangled Teasers, 9 totaling 10 minutes. Each is an animated minute of almost South Park-themed skits. One was an obvious take on a certain prescription medication that helps men. Wish I could say why these were even included...kids will miss some of the humor.<br />* The Disney 3D intro with the Lion King critters - old.<br />* The Disney intro to Digital Copy.<br />* Info: The pointless paragraph about commentaries.<br />* Disc 2 is the [[ASIN:B004G600A4 Tangled]] DVD.<br /><br />French and Spanish soundtracks with English 2.0 Descriptive Service and subs in same. I enjoyed the movie and BD quality, but the extras are almost bizarre in both production and/or why they were included. Still have to give it a 5-star review for overall worth with the DVD and Solid BD specs. Region coded A/B/C.<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to mention that the opening of the BD has a VERY small menu along the bottom that you have only a few seconds to select that allows you to bypass the hideous amounts of Disney material/trailers/promos. It goes by fast but it is sooooo worth it - I was giving this a 5-star before even seeing the rest just for that.

0399250573|3.0|Scorpia Rising excelled in action sequences and plot, but I felt like \\"something\\" was missing. I compared the past book, Eagle Strike, where the character Yassen Gregorovich sort of had a mystery going on with why he saved Alex. The emotional layer added to the book was excellent and I was very dissapointed to see a complex character killed off. In Scorpia, Alex's dad played an \\"invisible\\" character of sorts, and also added that much needed emotional layer to Alex's character and his desire to uncounsciously find what events led him to become a spy. In this book. Jack almost decided to leave Alex before he even became a legal adult. Then, they had the first real bonding moments that I can even remember within the whole series. The ending happened so quickly and Alex's response was a bit confusing in the last couple of chapters. Very simply, I love this book and would definitely recommend it, but seriously hope that Anthony Horowitz considers changing his mind and writing one more Alex Rider book, which will better address and tie-up the emotional build-up from the past books. Other than Alex, there weren't really any new, likeable characters that interacted with him and led to any real importance.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I originally heard of Katy Perry while surfing on Youtube. I came across her songs \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" and \\"Hot and Cold\\". Having liked them so much, I checked her first album \\"One of the Boys\\" out from the library. While these two songs and a couple of others were great, I was not that impressed with the album as a whole.      Teenage Dream did not disappoint me, though. In fact, I love it. The songs are so melodic and just plain fun to listen to. My mornings are so much better now that I have it to listen to while driving. While I cannot say I recommend it for children (it has a parental advisory sticker for a reason), those who are old enough should love it. The highlights of the album:     -Teenage Dream. This song is a great opener. The heavy guitar riffs during the chorus make the album start off with a bang.     -Last Friday Night. The upbeat rhythm makes it a great party or dance song. Especially since it is about getting wasted and doing scandalous-yet-fun stuff on a Friday night.     -California Gurls. While the music video is incredibly stupid, the song itself is great. It features rapper Snoop Dogg on guest vocals.     -Firework. It rules. That is really all I can say. She hits the high notes with her voice; proving she can actually sing.     -Peacock. I get a guilty pleasure from listening to this song. Do a google search on the lyrics and see what I mean. The lyrics are so adult, yet the song is so catchy.     The rest of the album is good, too, but the above are hands-down the height of Perry's second album. Some artists have the sophomore slumps, but miss Perry is not one of them. It is so nice seeing good artists after all that garbage the music industry has been putting out this past decade.

0756404738|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  I did not, however, enjoy it as much as I enjoyed NotW.  It just wasn't as good, I felt; which is to say that [for me] it was still better than most of what one finds in the fantasy genre these days.    While not as tight of a telling as Day One was, I can still see purpose in Day Two.  There's possibly good explanation for the wandering, sometimes aimless feel of Day Two.  Current-day Kote is retelling this story.  Day One contained a lot of foundational detail that Kote recalled quite vividly, maybe because it all occurred in his most formative years.  Day Two content is drawn from when Kvothe was in the throes of teenage turbulence and distractability.  Is it any wonder, then, that the story is not quite as well-constructed in the retelling?  That it meanders?  That it over-focuses on some things while glossing over others?  Viewed in that light, it makes sense to me.    That said, there were still parts that could have been pared down without discernable loss to the overall story and at great benefit to the pacing.      Still, the story is Kote's retelling of his life as Kvothe.  Thus, he's telling the details that stand out the most *to him*.  Even the aspects of Day Two that we can't currently see have any value to the story may reappear in Day Three, causing us to suddenly go, \\"Ohhhhhh! So *that's* why all that stuff about the Adem mattered in Day Two of the telling!\\"    Overall, I found the story mostly engaging.  Some of the word choices of the author served to yank me out of the story at times.  Certainly, the pacing didn't meet my expectations based on the pacing of Day One.  And some parts went beyond the bounds of dull into the territory of trite and repetitive and occasionally what I considered as sub-quality writing compared to what I know Pat to be capable of. ***[SLIGHT SPOILER]***  Felurian was naked.  We get it.  No need to remind us a half-dozen times per page for 50 pages.  Even if I could excuse the constant hyper-focus ofKvothe on the naked physique of a female, Kote [who, let's not forget, is retelling the story] should be well past that sort of hyper-focus and, I daresay, somewhat jaded to it by now.       One of the best qualities I found in NotW was that Pat didn't talk down to his readers but seemed to expect us to piece some things together on our own without him spelling everything out for us.  Parts of WMF seemed to violate that, which disappointed me.    So while better than many fantasy novels, WMF didn't quite measure up to the balance and wholeness I sensed in NotW.  Like anything in life, it has its good and bad points.  The bad points were not bad enough to put me off the story.  The good points were good enough to keep me coming back.
0618680004|3.0|This semester in Seminary, I have been taking a terribly fascinating class entitled \\"Dangerous Religious Ideas\\". Perhaps it is more accurate to describe my class experience as both fascinating and at the same time a bit terrifying as we have been exploring religious ideas that have been the cause or the excuse for so much suffering in our world both in the past and up to the present.  So far, we have covered the dangerous ideas of \\"Chosenness - are there particular groups especially chosen/favored by God?\\" & \\"Martyrdom: Witness, Self-sacrifice, Victimhood or Aggression\\". Subjects still to come include the issues of \\"Reward and Punishment\\" and \\"Sabbath as Sacred and Subversive\\". Complicating the discussions and understanding of these Dangerous Religious Ideas is that of course they have also been the cause or excuse for good things that have been done and are being done. My initial impulse to reject these dangerous ideas outright can be argued as the proverbial throwing the baby out with the bath water. So perhaps  you can see now how these subjects have led to some terribly fascinating discussions. [...]

B002ZG997C|5.0|The BOOK OF ELI     THE BOOK OF ELI ADDRESSES SEVERAL ISSUES FOR TODAY.     In the Movie, the earth was scorched by the sun and the survivors burned all the Bibles. Why? They viewed the \\"natural catastrophe\\" as an act of God and in defiance and rebellion, burned His Word. The most allegorical statement of all by Gary Whitta, Eli was blind, but lived as though he could see ! In the Movie, Carnegie, Gary Oldman's character wants the Bible for power to control the world that he lives in. Carnegie represents the wolves in sheep's clothing that use the Bible for power, greed, and selfish ambition.     In the beginning of the Movie, Eli is attacked by a group of cannibals. Eli warns their leader, that if he puts his hand on him again, he will lose his hand, and of course the guy disregards the warning and loses his hand. After dismantling his attackers, Eli leans down to the leader, who now has one hand, and embraces him. He hugs him, as if to say I love you, and then kills him. To me, this is an allegorical way to say, love your enemies. It is possible to defend your nation and family and still love your enemies, you don't have to hate them. Eli was a chosen vessel of God that laid down his life, finished his course, was transformed, and received white robes in the end. Eli says grace over his meal and Solara gets Transformed and leaves her people to follow Eli. Towards the end of the Movie, Solara, goes back to her people. As Christians, when God sets us free to serve Him, the first thing that most of us do, is to go back to our friends and families to carry the Good News of the Gospel to them. Also in the original book the author did not include any other religions on the book shelf, the Bible stood alone. I imagine that Sodom and Gomorrah looked a little scorched after Gods' judgement of fire and brimstone[[ASIN:B002ZG997C The Book of Eli]].

B003UESJHY|4.0|Based on a true story.  This film won the AAs for best supporting actress, Melissa Leo, and best supporting actor, Christian Bale.  Tale focuses on a working class and sometimes irritating Lowell, MA family that has centered itself around the former glory days of eldest son, Dicky, who is trying to break his crack habit while his mother pretends it isn't an issue and continues to make him the favorite child (out of two sons and seven sisters).  The younger brother, Micky, is trying to break away from his family holding him back to make something of himself as a boxer.  While it focuses on the boxing it focuses on the family relationships a great deal more.  Themes of second chances, family and absorbing hurt for those you love (even when it's too much) are prevalent in this film.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; FAMILY FOCUS: A; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid March 2011.

B002ZG980U|5.0|INCEPTION     Christopher Nolan, is a genius. In the Movie Inception he uses allegory and symbolism to give a very timely message.  In an age where so many believe that they are the product of their own choices, Nolan uses being awakened out of a dream to speak loudly. In the Movie in order to be awakened out of a dream state, the character must be tipped over in their chair. When they sense the feeling of falling they wake up. As Christians, the first thing that we have to come to grips with, in order to be saved, is that we were all born under the fall of Adam. We have to know that we are fallen. In Gods' reality, He is God and we are not. God is constantly placing before us life and death and He tells us to `Choose Life.' In the dreamworld depicted in the Movie, Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, says that, You don't have to choose down here, you can create your own world and get to be your own God down here.    In Romans 1, Paul tells us that the penalty for suppressing the knowledge of the truth is to be given over to a reprobate mind, a mind that believes lies. In the Movie,  Cobb's wife Mal, played by Marion Cotillard, prefers the dreamworld to the real reality that we live in. Cobb, says twice that she once knew the truth and she tucked it away somewhere. The second time that Cobb says this, he says that he gave her this lie about a train, and she believed the lie which eventually killed her.    In the real world, we perceive what is around us, but we don't get to create it. The world that God created for us to live in, can only be perceived correctly through the lens of scripture, the lens by which our vision is corrected. In a dream world, we create and perceive at the same time, because in a dream world we think we are our own god. In the Movie, the dreamworld is created by an architect, but just like in real life, there is a price for trying to be our own god. When we worship our own will and choice, we are attacked by Satanic forces. In the Movie, whenthe architect changes the reality of the dreamworld, the other people in the dream, which are projections of their mind, converge on the architect and attack like white blood cells. To me this speaks allegorically to those that think that they create their own world by their confession or choice. The Bible teaches that God, the real Creator, surrounds us with the day. Also, in Deuteronomy 28, God says, in addition to being cursed at everything we put our hands to, that He will raise up Nations against us when we are disobedient to the Covenant.    The Bible teaches us that we are made in Gods' image, which means that all of our being is imprinted with His characteristics. This why we have a desire to be justified, to be right, to be accepted, and to be Holy like Him. Because of these facts about our desire to be justified, Robert Fischer Jr., is easy prey. In the Movie, Robert Jr., is about to inherit his fathers' energy conglomeration and his father does not approve of him or show him any fatherly affection. When Cobb and his team plant the idea that his father will accept him if he becomes his own man, Robert Jr., is convinced that to to accomplish this, he must break up the corporation that his father spent his whole life building, and build his own empire. Again the idea that we have to be our own creator of our own reality, as opposed to being satisfied with our Fathers Kingdom.    In the Movie, Cobb has a murder charge which prevents him from coming back into the United States and seeing his children. Saito, played by Ken Watanabe, is a very powerful man that promises Cobb that he can make his crime go away, if Cobb keeps his promise to him. In other words, Cobb's sin will go away if he keeps the agreement with Saito. In the end, Saito delivers on his promise to Cobb. The Bible teaches us that if we endure and are faithful to the covenant agreement that we have with God through Christ, we will receive the promise. In that agreement we also have the promise ofhaving our sin washed away so that we can enter into the Kingdom !

Some of the other reviews on here go into more detail as to which songs and albums are better in mono or stereo. This box set is highly recommended!

B000005JA8|5.0|Trout mask replica is a masterpiece, not just because it's difficult, or because it's art, or I'm simply because I am name dropping as one reviewer as wrote.     Simply put, you'll never come across anything as inventive. As for pretentious, possibly, but you might as well throw away 95 %   of your cd collection. Name me some quality artists and musicians, that are not pretentious?! (good luck)    All art is pretentious. So with that in mind, get over yourself and buy this cd, don't start off on one his easier listens, like \\"Safe as milk\\" or \\"Shiny Beast\\"    Dive in head first, buy this and get \\"lick my decals off baby\\" (more than likely on download)     Not all of you will get it straight away, it may take a few listens. An avid Beefheart fan once said to me, it took him 10 years to get into \\"Decals\\". So Trout should be a walk in the park.     Anyway, if this ain't for you, I believe there are about 100 safe and pleasant, fluffy albums coming out over the next few months.  Buy the new Cheryl Cole album instead.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|This is a fantastic family movie!  It is heartwarming, humorous, sad (at times) and inspirational all at the same time.  It is the true story about the history behind the greatest race horse of all time Secretariat.  It was not only an entertaining movie but insightful and informative as well.  We learned about the life of those in horse racing, their ups and downs, challenges and joys.  Everyone loved it ... even my teenage son who prefers \\"action\\" films was touched by this story.  We have watched it several times and each time get nervous and excited before the races even though we know the outcome.  A great movie for any age.
1594202842|5.0|Don't be frightened off by the negative reviews of this book. These reviewers did not read the entire book. Had they done so, they would have discovered Ms. Chua's brilliant conclusion- our American Founding Fathers were all Tiger Mothers. They did not waste time, they pursued academic and personal success and they all were led on this path by parents and pastors. Thomas Jefferson attended to his studies for fourteen hours per day, including three hours to practice his violin. He then went on to help declare the independence of a new Christian country and was instrumental in providing the intellectual framework of our Constitution. As Ms. Chua's daughters note, the Chinese standards beloved by their mother are also American Christian standards that built the greatest country in the world. Ms. Chua learns the point of diminishing returns with her second daughter and father- he left China to escape the suffocating society and expectations of his parents. But she maintains that Chinese/ old fashioned standards are better than the modern wishy-washy joke of \\"choice.\\" As she clearly states, modern parents tell their children that they can make choices in their lives, then leave the room. They are then left alone to sort the wheat from the chaff. This is why they watch so much television and waste time on Facebook. What kind of choice is it to waste your childhood texting and sexting? This is the time to gather skills, and try out your abilities to learn new experiences.  On the surface, this is a sort of day by day explanation of what she did in raising her children. It is NOT meant to be a guide. You must take her descriptions with a grain of salt. At heart, however, this book is revolutionary. It is a prod and counsel for parents wavering between strict parenting and \\"anything goes\\" nanny picking. Can you look around you and see a single problem that would not be eliminated by parents who actually decided to raise their own children? America has seemingly given up theactual day-to-day, hands-on raising of our children. It is a fact that many of us dump them in day care, starting at 6 weeks old, then move to day schooling and after school programs. Are you really having a say in your child's upbringing if you leave them off at 7am and don't see them again until 6pm, Mon thru Fri?   The Wall Street Journal ran Ms. Chua's review, then ran a review of the opposite camp, the \\"bad mother\\" book. When comparing the reviews, I had my answer of what I wanted for my children. Ms. Chua's children are flanking her, neatly dressed and looking at the camera. Bad mother's children are shaggy and ill-groomed, ignoring the camera, playing a video game and watching what appears to be a television. How do I want my children to behave when (if) the Wall Street Journal is taking a family photo?  My husband and I are in a mixed marriage- he is a laid back parent, while I want the kids to strive. We decided that piano lessons were a good choice for our 11 year old daughter and 7 year old son. Both my husband and the piano teacher recommended that we not push the son, for fear of having him \\"hate\\" the piano. I, thus, let them practice alone. After reading Ms. Chua's book, I threw caution to the wind and sat down with my son to do a real practice. We sat for an hour- previously he sat for 5 mins. We played each selection three times. He complained, but did it. I had to threaten many times. After a month of our Chua-ization, he sits at the piano with me, four times a week, one hour a day, and is progressing beautifully. He LIKES it! Not loves it, but likes it. He wants to play selections to surprise Daddy, he tells his friends that he plays. My husband is horrified, and cannot be in the room when we work. He also cannot be home when we do our homeschooling. He doesn't have the stomach for it. But I do- and Ms. Chua's book will help any American parent gain that grit.  If you have any doubts about modern day parenting, grab this book and grab the courage it will give you to do the hard work in raising some children of worth.

Though having stated that, Keith's voice comes through loud and clear. Wow - what a ride! We begin the trip during his early years in the post-war deprivation of outer London. The early soundtrack music (Yes, it's a book! but the music is ever present and vividly described) is Elvis, Buddy, Eddie then Chicago Blues Man! We hear this early stuff via the distant sound waves and scratchy reception of Radio Luxembourg, late at night, in the dead cold, under the bed covers, on an old wireless. From there we whizz through LIFE and MUSIC and More Life and so much more MUSIC. The music comes thick and fast and song-writing so prolific (especially the 60's and 70's) that it seems to drip from the fingers. I got so stoned during some passages (passively consuming) that the writing disappeared in a purple haze. So there's a lot I don't remember - but they say if you remember it, you weren't really there! Believe me, I was there man! I am there still! LOVED IT! Can't wait to finish it - so I can start again!!
B000WGWQG8|2.0|I guess it's possible that John Adams was obnoxious, pompous,and self-absorbed.  But it's really hard to believe his character flaws were as extreme as those portrayed in the miniseries. It's also difficult to watch hours and hours of storyline when the main character is portrayed with those characteristics.    People keep claiming the miniseries is educational.  If you're an adult, you should already know way more about the forces at play at the time our country declared independence and ratified the constitution than you could ever possibly learn from watching this. I can also think of much better educational tools to teach these concepts to children than this miniseries.     The only thing that kept me watching this through to the end was the performance of Stephen Dillane, who played Thomas Jefferson. He was riveting. In my opinion, there was too much overacting by Giamatti and Linney. The death bed scenes were over the top in terms of stupidity.  I actually had to turn the sound off at one point because it was just too absurd.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The exclusive version of Angry Birds, features the same addictingly simple game play of the original, but with a twist on the objective.  You are freeing some birds heroin their cages, instead of blowing up the green pigs.  I've only finished chapter one right now, and the graphics are a lot more colorful and detailed.  There was also some environmental interactions with breaking light bulbs, swinging lamp shades, and birds bouncing on trampolines that were missing in the original.  Seems like a worthy addition to the series to keep angry birds mania fueled for a while longer.
B0026PA05M|5.0|Saw them and heard of them for the first time at a Trapt concert. Met Halestorm outside after the show and bought their first EP from Arejay (the drummer) who then walked my friend and I to my car and attempted to kiss me, & wanted me to go to the bar with them but that's another story, LOL.  Anyway, seeing them live was super impressive and Lzzy knows how to rock! Love her voice and love the guitars, drums ALL OF IT!  This album was even better than I expected it to be. It was nice to have this after listening to the 5 songs on their EP over and over again! Also love this version of \\"It's Not You\\", even though it doesn't have to super long awesome intro, but you can see that live if you catch them on stage :)  BUY IT! THEY ROCK!
B001IF252M|5.0|I just got a new MacBook Pro (older i7's) and I needed this to run some presentations. I bought it from Amazon (not a third party fullfilled by Amazon, not a third party, just Amazon) and it arrived quickly using free shipping. I was surprised how easily it worked, even on Windows! It literally is plug and play. Connect the Displayport to your Mac and the VGA cable to the VGA port. Once both are plugged in, the Mac adjusts itself for the best configuration. Easy as that! The only (very) minor issue is that if you shift the adapter around too much, the signal will be temporarily lost, but will restore itself quickly.    I have not experienced any issues after two months of usage. Connections are solid. Recommended for anybody with a Mac!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT : )  THIS IS THE BEST BEST  BEST  GAME EVER.  : ) ; )  I CAN'T WAIT TO TAKE THE KIDS TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE
B004GJYROG|5.0|This is one of my favorite child-hood movies. If you are a fan of animation or sports, this movie is for you. It is short, simple, and sweet in all the right places. I highly recommend it, and for the price, you can't beat it.
B000059GEH|5.0|My favorite Marylin Monroe performance, by far!  Monroe keeps me laughing, Grable is adorable, and Bacall is trying to keep them all in check.  Each is trying to nab a wealthy husband, and we see what happens when things don't quite go as planned.  Good quality on DVD.  Much nicer to have than to wait around for it to pop up on TCM once again.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|When twitter for android first came out I was comparing it to tweetie on the iphone. The android app failed in almost every way possible. It was sluggish, low on features and had a horrible interface. Now it has been updated to be more like the twitter app on the iphone. It has a much improved interface, never lags, and has a boatload of features that iOS users get. Thanks for the update!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game, all the bad reviews are people that don't like app store. its free why complain!? Anyways graphics are improved, game is same if not better.
B004L49K20|5.0|I've been a fan from the very beginning when \\"Planet Earth\\" and \\"Girls on Film\\" were introduced to the world via MTV and top 40 radio.They dominated for much of the early 80s. After \\"Big Thing\\" I lost interest skipping entirely \\"Astronaunt\\" and \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" fearing their glory days were behind them.    This is the return we privately hoped but never imagined. What an album! Listen to the tracks. What comes to mind is that classic Duran sound - hypnotic, lyrical and highly infectious, but with a twist. They have re-invented themselves for the next generation while still being able to capture the hearts & minds of their original fanbase.     Hear \\"Being Followed\\" and notice the background guitar riff from \\"New Religion\\" echoed. \\"Girl Panic,\\" the next single is today's answer to \\"Girls on Film\\". \\"Other People's Lives\\" evokes the same emotional response as \\"Careless Memories.\\"    What makes the album is the inclusion of female vocalists Ana Matronic on \\"Safe\\" and Kelis on \\"The Man who stole a Leopard\\" (This will be there biggest hit to date!) Mark Ronson as Producer has brought the best out of them.     Get the DELUXE VERSION FOR TWO REASONS: 1 - The bonus track \\"Networker Nation\\" holds its own. 2 - The DVD. Not only do you get the video for the first single (which is my least favourite track) but it has a song by song video commentary of how each track was created, the inspirations etc and other features like an interview of Mark Ronson and Clunie Reid the up and coming visual artist who did the cover. You get to appreciate how truly musically gifted they are!    The booklet includes full lyrics, printed on high quality paper and embossed cd cover deliver the final touches to this cd which you will be playing for the rest of this year and beyond.    NOTE: There are two other Deluxe Versions. One being sold by an American retailer featuring two extra tracks: \\"Too Close to the Sun\\" and \\"Early Summer Nerves.\\"  The other by a online British retailer that includesa second cd with three remixes of \\"All You need is now.\\"
0316098337|5.0|This book took a bit to get into, but I was intrigued by the story line. Once I got past page 70 or so, I was hooked. Loved it and read it in just 2 days. Such a sweet story of a mother and son. Creatively written and really got me thinking about the day to day things that we take for granted. Would highly recommend this to others.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Just a gimicky marketing ploy for some lame movie. Game is far too easy and just feels like they pulled the pork and stuck.in same Disney characters or whatever the movie is.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I have never listened to Daft Punk before this album, but I like Air, Radiohead, certain fusion jazz artists (Metheny, Shakti). I am also a soundtrack fan, particularly when it comes to choosing music for driving and working out. This album, in my opinion, is really helpful in providing the listener with a sense of focus. I think this is the case because the album provides an incredible range of variations on the core melody, which include both synthesizer- and orchestra-based recordings (as well as, often combinations of both).<br /><br />Obviously there are a lot of people on Amazon who are celebrating this album, and that makes me happy. I think it's a work that deserves more attention than it's getting. Daft Punk should have won an oscar for this.
B004I2K4E8|3.0|I don't get it. It's incredibly grainy, either high ISO noise or horrible compression on the disc. It's more like DVD quality than Blu Ray quality.   Very unimpressed.    The show, of course, is excellent with very few exceptions. Nick Jonas is uninteresting to watch but his voice does fit Marius well. He's clearly out of his league. Lea Salonga is the most committed actress I've ever seen on stage. She's just the greatest.   Everyone else was good but forgettable.   Too bad this wasn't the 10th anniversary cast....
0451209338|4.0|This is my first Daniel Silva book, having \\"found\\" him since I'm a Vince Flynn and Tom Clancy fan.  I enjoyed the book and its plot.  However, the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is the following:    SPOILER ALERT!    it seems implausible to have a beautiful French model be a Mossad agent.  Even more unlikely is the fact that she is willing to cheapen her body and sleep with her \\"target\\" when necessary to complete a mission.  We were told that this happened numerous times throughout her spy career.    the second thing that bothered me was near the end, when Jacqueline escaped from Leila.  There was no reason Tariq would keep her alive once he crossed the border.  Furthermore, Leila, as an accomplished PLO field agent, couldn't have been so stupid as to let Jacqueline go to the restroom with the door closed.  That's just not believable.    anyways, I will read his next book on the Gabriel Allon series.  Cheers!
0061992860|5.0|I've been wanting to get the SAS Survival Handbook for a while now.  So I was delighted to see that an updated, mini-sized version of it was available.  Not only is there the obvious advantages in size and weight, but the paper quality is excellent.  You can put a few drops of water directly on any page, let it sit for a bit, and then wipe it off, and the page will show no signs of wear or damage.  Excellent purchase experience.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Now this book isn't as bad as the now 43 people rate it as. There are some points where you don't want to know what shes eating but over all the history is interesting. This author wastes no time describing diana's back history. I personally enjoyed this book.
B002U6CJO2|3.0|thought there might be some extra features on the DVD, but this is just a bare bones good copy of a great anime movie....watch it with surround sound, the music is awesome!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|These reviews are for the program itself. They are not for Amazon.com or your crappy service provider. The game is fun and entertaining on a mobile for free. Nobody cares about where you are located when they look at these reviews. The reviews should only be available for legitimate downloaders or the program. Reviewing a program badly because you can't download it is as bad as the retards that review a product badly because the shipping sucked. Too bad. Take that up with the shipping company. People like this ruin reviews for good programs. Worthless people.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloaded and used this app for one day. Worked fine, no force closes although I only got through a few levels. Next day tried to reopen the app without having wifi access on my tablet. Now it won't load \\"Amazon Appstore: unknown error. An error occurred. Please download this app again from the Amazon Appstore.\\" Does this mean you have to have network access to play? Tried again from home but still same error. Had to remove app manually and redownload (no autmatic options from Appstore -- not a great feature). Did this several times, no go. Logged into Appstore and connected to the network via wifi during all of this. Tried again this morning but still no go. What the what? Very disappointed in this. Not a very good start to your Appstore (or as it will soon be renamed, Amazon Appmarket).
B004KA9MQO|1.0|'I Remember Me' is another in a very long line of albums with unmemorable songs, wherein the singer over-emotes.  In a year from its release, no one will ever play this disc, it will quickly fade into absolute obscurity.
B003Y3BSTC|1.0|I'm really upset with the kindle edition of this book. A lot of mistakes in it, and the errata published on their website is really messy to use with the electronic edition of the book (I'm using the kindle app on my ipad). And why should we use an errata with an electronic edition of a book, in the first place ? An extra 1/5 an hour spent by someone anyway compiling the mistakes for the web errata on actually making the corrections in the electronic edition of the book seems like a logic and decent thing to do ... Apparently not. Because of this approach I give the lowest possible rating to the book . It seems like a rip off. It's really annoying spending 1/2 an hour to sort out a math problem and then discover, after another 1/2 an hour of trying to figure out what from the errata goes where on the messy page system of the kindle edition, that  somebody made you pay for yet another gratuitously sloppy product.
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe met as young adults in the late 1960s.  Smith's memoir of their time together shows her poet's touch.  While the book progresses in chronological order, the snippets of events and interactions between the two young people and the colorful collection of famous, infamous, and unknown characters around them fit together like the collages Mapplethorpe created.  The imagery and language are beautifully written.    In addition to being a fascinating glimpse into the NYC scene of the late 60s and early 70s, the book gives us an insider's view of two young artists at the very beginning of their careers.  For most of the book, Smith has no plans to be a rock singer.  We get to see the early glimmers of her future as she meets Lenny Kaye and asks him to play guitar at her first poetry reading.  Likewise, for most of the book, Mapplethorpe resists the suggestion that he take his own photos for his collages.   We get to see the small steps and decisions and circumstances that led them to their artistic destiny.    I've always been a fan of Patti Smith's, although I haven't listened to her music much for the last few years.  After finishing this book, though, I'm pulling out the old cds and going back through the songs.  The music is still great, and now I know more about the background for many of the songs.  For me, that alone makes the book worth reading.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I just wasted an hour of my day trying to download this app. They say it is free but it will not give you the app.
B004FLIXVS|4.0|I was a little disappointed with the song selection here. Live on Two Legs in my opinion is better. I would have liked to have some more of their newer songs and more hard to find cover songs than the recurring live versions of their classics like Alive and Jeremy. If you are a fan from their inception then you have purchased a few of their \\"import\\" concert CD's in the 90's when Tower Records existed. So to me it is a rehash of songs that I already have several versions of already. But being the crazed fan that I am I had to own if for Live versions of two new covers and the songs from Backspacer. While I like it I would give it more of a 3 1/2 stars than 4. And if you could get your hands on the Fox Theater concert from April 3, 1994 then do it, as that IMHO is their best concert CD.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|Seeing this film for the first time--Near its beginning I was laughing.  Initially, &#34;Bonjour Tristesse&#34; seems dated.  Cecile (Jean Seberg), is flitting from man to man diffidently (19 year old Seberg portrays a 17 year old character, going on 37).  In Chapter 4 of this DVD, we see her facing the camera, dancing with a man, as she simultaneously narrates this scene in a bitter, hollow voice.  One has to wonder &#34;What is wrong with this girl?  What has made her so heartless?&#34; The action then shifts to the French Riviera, enticingly filmed in Technicolor; ultra-bright blues and greens--Even the olive-colored tiles in the bathroom of Cecile's bathroom are stunning.  But something's off--Superstition hangs over the sunny Mediterranean like a shroud--The number 7 having particular significance in this story.  The picture gets cooking about halfway through--Things start to unravel when Anne (Deborah Kerr), the new woman of Cecile's father, Raymond (David Niven), starts to impose her morally superior will upon amoral Cecile.  Anne forbids Cecile to see Phillippe, a law student from the neighboring villa, as he will distract Cecile from studying for the philosophy exams that she has recently flunked.  Cecile becomes furious with Anne; &#34;Anne is prim and prissy and a prude and a know-it-all, and I hate her!&#34; she exclaims while sticking needles into her doll.  Cecile sets a trap involving her boyfriend Phillippe and one of her father's ex-girlfriends; Cecile calls upon &#34;Jealousy the Green Eyed Monster&#34; to do her bidding.  The consequences of this plan end up being unexpectedly tragic, and Cecile and Raymond return to Paris, where they &#34;Live in Limbo&#34; together, going through the motions of life.  Father and Daughter end up living a lie they cannot come to terms with, either within themselves or with each other.  What makes this film work is its light, bubbly atmosphere of &#34;fun&#34; that is maintained throughout the film.  The first half of the picture could easily be seen as fluffy, contrived, pretentious.  But eventually this veneer is stripped away to reveal pain and denial of the characters--Their regret, remorse and tragedy.  Only after the film's end did I realize that this atmosphere had been created to contrast the grim reality of the subtext.  The final scene of the picture is chilling in the manner of &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34;.  Additional highlights include (1) the crisp, clean, black and white cinematography of Paris; and (2) the original trailer for &#34;Bonjour Tristesse&#34;, included on this DVD, that gives nothing away.<br /><br />Stephen C.

B0000029DD|5.0|this may be the single greatest album ever.  buckley is the most consistent artist i've been able to turn people onto with very little effort.  guys, girls, and trans folks alike love him, and with good reason.  perhaps he achieved perfection early with this album and that's why he's no longer with us in a physical form.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|hey amazon, angry birds rio free for 1st day... and anyone out of the usa can't download... WTF. Seriously, i purchase often on amazon, if you don't do anything soon, i'll boycott amazon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|the graphics are slightly different in this game, but I actually think they're better and easier to see than in the original. also the targets are different. I'm still on level 1 but so far no piggies. the difficulty level is closer to the original than seasons: its not hard right from the start but gets gradually more difficult.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|An angry birds game that actually runs on my phone. This is what I've been waiting for. 25 word minimum is the target. Stay on target. Stay on target.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds is such a fun game. It's based on a simple premise that anyone can pick up in seconds. There are so many levels with such unique variety that you will be entertained for hours and hours. Runs pretty well on my Optimus. There is some jitter, but doesn't affect gameplay much.
B004NOH9LW|1.0|I love Matt Damon and I would listen to him read the phonebook, but this entire movie was off! There plot points that went nowhere and then everything get wrapped up in the most convoluted manner. The entire film watching process was painful and confusing.

B0045HCJKS|5.0|This film is a classic. Instead of Itchy and Scratchy Land, you have Westworld and evil cowboy robots. Its in the top 100 Find it on VHS at Half Price Books list. Michael Crichton does very well with his story as the director. The production and set design are superb and the pacing is great. It was released originally by MGM and subsequently by Dedonde Studios. Michaelmatician commands us to put it in our queues. We will learn to see the Michrotron.

B003L20ID8|4.0|First of all, this is not Inception. Whether you take that as a good thing or bad, it's true. But that definitely doesn't mean it's a bad film, in fact The Adjustment Bureau digs deep into the subject of destiny just like Inception digs deep into dreams. But does it dig deep enough?<br /><br />The story follows David Norris (Matt Damon), a popular politician who is running for senator. He's at the head of the election race until some college photos of himself pulling pranks are leaked and damage his chances of winning badly.<br /><br />On the election night, it's already pretty clear that David's chances of winning are none.

B00433TO52|5.0|I don't have much to write, but I was so thrilled when I got this that I just felt I must say that I think this collection is for every Shakespeare fan out there! As one myself, I will tell you it has all the plays and poems I already know, these extra ones that I am excited to read, and its got all this great analysis and essays and commentaries. Plus biographies! What more can you ask for!!
B004EJ14V2|3.0|This movie wasn't very realistic. It was pretty annoying to watch. Some parts were funny but a really \\"that's lame\\" kind of funny. Overall this movie could have been so much better. I thought it was stupid how the main character wore a corset after she started lying for her acquaintances. Her corset was the only thing she wore and with a pair of jeans. It looked like lingerie and nobody wears lingerie to school, eh? Yeah right. So, even if you were lying for your friends that doesn't mean you're going to start wearing lingerie outfits to school!?!?  Nobody does that. Get real! Stupid movie. I also didn't like how the the nerds kept asking her to lie for them, it was just, again, very unrealistic. Does this really happen, where a girl degrades herself all in the name of someone else's insecurity!?1? Yeah, right. Only in Easy A. The plot for this movie is easily sexist and not very thought provoking. It is your typical teenage boy male plot which was also very poorly executed. I cannot begin to fathom. I agree with the person who said this movie just didn't really leave any type of particular feeling behind. I didn't feel like \\"oh my god, that was an awesome movie\\" like I did in the movie they made fun of (in the movie) Can't Buy Me Love. Now that is an awesome 5 star movie for this particular genre. Go see it, if you  haven't seen it. :) I would honestly give this movie 2 1/2 stars. I barely recommend. We all know who would like this movie though without offending anyone. :)
B002ZG981E|5.0|Where to begin with a movie like Inception. You have action, you have drama, romance, tragedy, and most importantly, dreams. This is certainly, so far, the best movie of the year. Christopher Nolan (Director of The Dark Knight) has done it again. But what makes this movie so great?<br /><br />The main character in the film is Cobb (DiCaprio) whose job is pretty much to steal dreams from peoples minds. The movie begins with him and his coworker; Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), doing exactly that to a man named Saito.<br /><br />There mission fails and they are caught by Saito. We then learn that Cobb has to children waiting for him in the US, but he can't go there after being accused of doing a certain crime (I will not spoil it).<br /><br />Saito explains to Cobb that if he does a job for him, he will help him return to his children. This job is indeed Inception (Placing an idea in someones mind and making them believe that it's their own). Cobb is convinced, and him and Arthur set off to form a team to help them do the job.<br /><br />Hope you like it or buy it at amazon.<br /><br />To continue reading: [...]
B004G600A4|5.0|All the reviews before me have pretty much said it already, but I'll say it anyway: this is a fabulous movie!  I thought the ads looked very appealing and couldn't wait to see it and wasn't disappointed at all.  Both my mom and I went to see it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm going to see it again this weekend and can't wait; it's like I'm a little kid again.  The movie is witty and hilarious, the story charming and heartwarming, and the lantern scene really is beautiful to watch and listen to.  Maximus by the way is honestly my most favorite Disney animated character EVER.  He completely steals the show!  Pascal and the Snuggly Ducklings thugs do too, to a degree, but no one is better than Maximus.      I must say that I'm very impressed that Disney managed to both modernize the Rapunzel fairy tale while keeping it very true to the spirit of the classic tale.  All the classic Disney fairy tale elements are there but unlike some past Disney princesses, Rapunzel is feisty and determined and not at all the usual passive damsel-in-distress waiting to be rescued by a handsome prince who she marries five seconds later.  Thank you Disney for finally bringing a princess to screen who has her own mind and courage and determination and isn't afraid to use them!  And also major props to Disney for the character of Mother Gothel, probably one of the most interesting but also complex Disney animated movie villainess we've ever had.  (Btw she may be mean and evil but I still want her outfit she wore in the movie).       The only minor quibble I can add to this is (and I will get flamed for this)...as good as Zach Levi's singing voice is, I kind of wish they'd gotten an actual singer to do it.  Zach had a good and solid voice but I felt like Mandy's voice really outshone his in \\"I See the Light\\" and wished they'd gotten someone like Josh Groban to sing his part.  Sorry, Zach.  But both his and Mandy's acting were wonderful, as was Donna Murphy as the fantastically theatrical Mother Gothel.  The songs are great though and I enjoyed all of them.  \\"I Have a Dream\\" will definitely give you the giggles.    Tangled forever!  MAXIMUS FOREVER!!!!
B003ASLJRW|4.0|This is one of the best Eastwood movies ever.  The quality is no different from the DVD.  The \\"BluRay\\" part of the product doesn't really mean much.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is exactly the same as the regular angry birds Rio except no ads. for all you who rated this bad what we're you expecting, it tells you exactly what you are getting. I  received  this free  but it is worth $.99 cents. Im tired  of people being so negative on here. Be happy they give you a free app every day, stop crying and enjoy.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|A must-have for 80ies fantasy lovers.  With the original idea and Queen's soundtrack this is an absolute classic.  They failed to remaster it, so the video quality is essentially that of an 80ies VHS, or at best the DVD version thereof.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|the app downloads but wont install I know its  not my phone I had the same problem with othe angry bird apps. I had to unmount my sd card and it workes, but not for this, it says I have to have an sd card! I give up!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I'm going to assume that people read reviews in order to decide whether or not to buy a book.  Some of us may also read reviews to start or join fights, but I'll leave that be.<br /><br />My stance: This may now be my Favorite Book Ever.  I am a huge Song of Ice and Fire fan, and I like this series more.  I don't think it's necessarily better; I think Kvothe is the first character I've wanted to *be*, warts and all, since I watched Return of the Jedi when I was single digits in age.  So, Bias Noted.<br /><br />Is This Book As Good As The First?  I can't answer that, because it's a much different book.  In Name of the Wind, a kid is learning to impose his will on the world, and demand that it allow him to try to be a hero.  Wise Man's Fear is, near as I can tell, the story of the world pushing back at that kid.  Being mad at the second book for not being like the other is like being mad that there's no Death Star at the end of Empire Strikes Back.<br /><br />Does This Book Get Anywhere?  YES - don't believe the hype.  Although Cinder doesn't reappear to burn down another town, the menace of the Chandrian is emphasized by its scope - Kvothe goes many places, everyone has heard of them, but no one wants to talk about them.  Their nature is mostly described by the quality of their absence.  If your ideal bad guys are about as subtle as stormtroopers, you may call this frustrating.  I do not.<br /><br />Is There Extra Junk In This Book We Shouldn't Care About?  No - unless Kvothe shooting fireballs at the Chandrian is all you came to the show to see.  I saw another review that mentions a device that gets a loving description early in the book, only to never be heard from again.  I disagree with that assessment, but to prove it, I'd have to cite a page number and make a spoiler to explain how and when that device turns out to have lasting impact.  In order to muddy the waters further, I can say there are at least three devices in the \\"story\\" portion that seem to link to the \\"inn\\".  For those who are worried we'll never get to \\"the action\\", I 'spect that the seemingly extra stuff is setting us up for the big finish.<br /><br />Though many things seem to happen too closely together to be believeable, I point out that this *is* a guy telling a story, and that's the only pacing complaint I had with the entire book.  The only way we can truly know whether the books have Extra Junk is to get to the end - for now, I trust Kvothe to keep us on the parts of the tale that are important.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Name of the Wind enough that you just want to know What Happens Next, buy this book.  If you want Kvothe to start cutting a Swath of Awesome, go watch something with lightsabers in it, then buy books two and three together, later.
B00000IGGA|4.0|he's got some of his best work on here, but whenever i listen to this album i'm constantly skipping around. the first four start out great. then you get to \\"house where nobody lives\\", which, and i cant say this about any other waits song i can think of, sucks. the song just sucks. it's the weakest thing i've heard of his.    then onto \\"cold water\\", one of the albums best songs. but right after that is the corny ballad \\"pony\\". next is \\"what's be building in there\\", another one of the album's best, followed by the weak \\"black market baby\\". what the hell???    the next three are winners, starting with the best song on the album \\"eyeball kid\\", followed by the gorgeous ballad \\"picture in a frame\\" (look for a beautiful rendition of this song at the end of the second disc of glitter and doom live). next is \\"chocolate jesus\\", which is probably the second best song on the album. it's a masterpiece.    then we come back to the every other song sucks business. \\"georgia lee\\", weak. \\"filipino box spring hog\\", awesome. \\"take it with me\\", weak. come on up to the house, an excellent closer.    there are really only three weak songs on the album, and one that downright sucks. if he took those four songs off and replaced one of them with buzz fledderjohn, it'd be high in the running with one of his best albums ever.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Works great on mt4g nice game Great graphics.who wants to do a 25 word minimum on a review lets see what I can type  to waste time....
B004SBS8LA|3.0|very cute game that's fun for any age. young and old alike will enjoy this game. download and see for yourself. what are u waiting for download it already!!!
B004QYZATW|5.0|What a fantastic subtle piece of comedy relief with stunning European backdrops. The acting was so clever and right on the spot for the plot. Great mix of intrigue, danger, suspense and humor. One of the best movies I've watched in ages.
B00005K3O4|5.0|There is a reason this is a cult classic! I loved this movie growing up and now my kids love it! It is original; with it's acid pies, popcorn monster seeds, killer shadow puppets, and let's not forget the Cotton candy Cocoons!! This is great for a good laugh or to scary the pants off of a friend with Coulrophobia (fear of clowns)!lol
B004SBS8LA|5.0|smooth as a babies bottom, I don't understand how some ppl are having such an issue with it, the game is AMAZING on my EVO

B00004RJ74|3.0|The way I see it, there are two distinct ways to see this movie. You can bemoan it for robbing you of a full Tarantino movie, delivered in his prime, by saddling the plot with an unexpected swerve into Robert Rodriguez exploitation. Or, you can sit back and enjoy it for the utterly unpredictable, bewildering, guns-blazing, \\"I can't believe that just happened,\\" speed boat that it is. I fall into the latter camp, and while both directors have undeniably made more intelligent, deep, well-rounded pictures, there's no denying From Dusk Till Dawn has a certain unusual charm that's tough to nail down. Tarantino's script elaborates loosely on a lot of the social observations he'd originally made in Natural Born Killers, while the film's semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek attitude is an obvious precursor to the superduo's collaborations on Grindhouse, marking it as an evolutionary milestone of sorts for both men. George Clooney steals most every scene as a take-no-crap heistmeister who's desperate to cross the Mexican border, Harvey Keitel seems unusually understated as the soft-spoken jaded preacher, and Tarantino himself breaks out his C-level acting chops in an appropriately stiff, detached performance as Clooney's creepy, sexual predator brother. Wasn't quite the joyride I'd remembered it as, but still provided a few laughs and a barrel full of blood.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Wifi Analyzer is a great tool for tuning your home WiFi router.  I was surprised to find that there were so many neighbors that were all running in the same channel range.  Also great to see that the Amazon appstore is keeping the app up to date.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I've put some time in on the original Angry Birds, and have never had trouble with the screen going into standby during the game.  But the Rio game can't even get through the introduction without going into standby.  My screen is set to blank after 30 seconds, so this will happen while birds are still rolling around on the screen waiting for a turn to finish.  There is no setting for this to be changed that I can find.  It is a horrible bug that needs to be fixed.  I should not have to change my system settings that are designed to save power just so that I can play a game for a little while.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have bought in years. I bought it for 3 specific songs and love every song on it. It is the only cd I own that I can put on shuffle and not have to worry about changing the song. So in short, if you like Breaking Benjamin, this is the album to get. You won't be sorry.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The original  star trek series on blu-ray is like watching the series for the first time. The series looks better then when it aired. I give   It 5 stars I wish they would do   these to lost in space series. If it would come out on blu-ray any fan of star trek should get this it looks awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
B002E01MJM|3.0|I recently bought the original 1972 release of this movie, and found it pretty engrossing and a pretty good (not that original however) story line ...the really bad thing about this movie was the silly Hillbilly music that kept playing during the rape/torture scenes ...who's idea was this??? Come on lets make up our minds here...is this Deliverance {in which the music was appropriate for the atmosphere that helped the story line} or is this a warped sense of humor on the directors/producers part??? This movie would have held more credibility and suspense if the music were more along the lines of Black Sabbath or say even Harry Chapin Carpenter...come on give me a break ...maybe they were to busy smoking that wacky weed..
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Would not install droid x ............................hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate me me me me me me me me me me me weightless u
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome game, awesome app store. I have read a bunch of the 1 star reviews, and most of them are written by people who dont understand how to use their apps or the app store. a big 5 stars for both!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i really liked this game. the graphics were great, and i find it really addictive. im gonna see rio just because of this game!! ya
B00127RAJY|3.0|First of all George is my husbands name. I am 56 and consider myself just somewhat active, (play volleyball, bowl, x-country and downhill ski) I've been trying to shed 10-15 lbs for months with only a pound or 2 down. I knew I needed to be more active (as well as watch diet)without spending too much money for a gym, so I decided to try the DVD. Well it is a very intense workout if you can do it. My problems(s) will not allow me to do the workout on the level it shows. And there is not much difference in the modified workout. With back and knee issues I cannot do the jumping jacks or twists, high knee kicks or plank positions as shown. I am still trying my best doing my own version, and working up a sweat! I love the strength training part, at least I can get my arms in better shape. But I still have no weight loss. I'm starting my 4th week only to advance to level 2. I keep switching it up though. So if you have no issues and are in ok shape I think it would be awesome for you! Very intense! (I probably need to do low impact water aerobics, sigh)
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I installed these triggers on my controllers immediately after buying the console and I love them. I tried playing without them and I just don't see how Sony could design a slippery trigger like they did. THIS is how the controller should've been designed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the best Angry Birds yet. It has gorgeous graphics and I think it has even better gameplay than the original Angry Birds. Thanks Amazon.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is amazing on my EVO. There are dozens of brushes, the ability to work in numerous layers, and a very friendly interface.   I was excited to see that layers could be hidden.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Okay I'm redoing my review on July 16, 2011. My first review I gave three stars but now its a solid five star!<br /><br />Black Star is a great short but sweet opener.<br />What the Hell shines as classic tongue in cheek Avril I loved it from the start.<br />Push is a great relationship song.<br />Wish You Were Here OMG this song may be my all time favorite song this whole album is like the soundtrack to my last failed relationship I still love him and this rocks.<br />Smile has a fun funky meaning to it but ironically it makes me cry the most.<br />Everybody Hurts has one of the best opening verses I love it it gets to me every time.<br />Alice is one of my early favorites although I like the soundtrack version better but its still great here.<br /><br />The rest of the album still blows me away heartbroken Avril is a good Avril... although I'm happy she's happy now :-) pick this up you will not regret...
0451228375|5.0|After reading the Pillars of the Earth I felt I had to read this sequel. Like \\"Pillars\\" this book delves into a lot of detail immersing the reader in the period of the book's story. Although the book clocks in a just under 1000 pages you never get tired of reading it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Let me just say that these are the greatest headphones I have EVER OWNED, period. This is my birthday present that I got for turning 18. I love everything about these headphones. The sound is perfect from what my ears are hearing. The comfort is almost perfect, but they do get annoying after a few hours of wearing them. They fit around my big dwarf head which is safetly to say that they'll fit anybody's head. haha It blocks out a lot of exterior like talking, computer fans, etc, though it's not perfect. You'll still hear dog barking, people yelling, jet engines, etc. I don't trust that this could take much of a beating, and I feel like I could snap these headphones in half if I really wanted to. As long as you aren't going to snap them in half or have an angry fit and throw them across the room. I think that this would last for a while, though the ear paddings, not really. It's not flimsy, it's just not indestructible. haha I would hope so because these are very expansive. I've been using them for 3 hours now and been addicted. I just love wearing them. haha When I got it in the mail, the packaging was if I was buying something expensive. It wasn't like it was half assed and no bubble wrap. Actually it was wrapped in a very soft material and jumbo size bubble wrap. The packaging was nicly presented and everything was secured. I love the silky bag that it came with. I didn't get the free software, but I did get the free adapter which I will be using for my keyboard.<br /><br />These are pretty much the best headphones you could get. If you want to listen to music, or create music, buy this product. You won't regret. ;)
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I give it 3 stars because I feel it may have been rushed. The levels are in no way challenging and the entire game can be competed in one play through.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I also would like to read Fall of Giants  but price is outrageous!!  Each day I find that the price of Kindle  products is going up! I'm thinking of putting  my Kindle on the bookshelf to gather dust!  Everyone who owns a Kindle should boycott  publisher price ripoff!
B004FQKY5Q|5.0|For those of you who don't know where Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle got the name for their band, Roxette, from, they got it from a song called \\" Roxette \\" by a singer named Jim Johnston, or Johnson, or something like that.  Now, what exactly is a \\" roxette \\", you may ask?  Well, according to the Urban Dictionary, a \\" roxette \\" is a tricked-out, or rather pimped-out, dandy of a girl ( kind of like a Cadillac \\" Pimp My Ride \\" style ) that is is so fly, so beautiful, so HOT that everyone who sees that girl going by says \\" look at that girl... she is such a ROXETTE!!! \\"<br />  Well, for 21 years of my life, ever since I was 13 years old, Roxette ( Roxette IS Marie Fredriksson & Per Gessle, the 2 integral members of the band ) have been my \\" roxettes \\".  I HAVE EVERY SINGLE, EVERY ALBUM, EVERY VIDEO, POSTERS, I WAS PART OF THE FAN CLUB, I HAD FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD, I HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AMASSING A GIGANTIC ROXETTE COLLECTION. I love these Super Swedes like I love my own blood, and when Marie was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2001 I thought I WAS GOING TO DIE.  JUST THE THOUGHT OF NEVER HEARING PER AND MARIE SING TOGETHER AGAIN, IT WAS HEARTBREAKING.  FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR SOLO CAREERS, PER MADE 3 OR 4 ALBUMS, FOUND A GIRL NAMED HELENA CHRISTIANSEN WHO SOUNDED A LOT LIKE MARIE FREDRIKSSON, BUT NO ONE COULD EVER REPLACE HER. I thought Roxette was a thing of the past, I had given up hope, I DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IT BUT I DID.<br />  But slowly but surely, like a TRUE PHOENIX THAT RISES FROM THE ASHES, MARIE BUILT HERSELF UP AGAIN. Slow at first, but she surely did.  First with her album \\" The Change \\", then with her faithful husband Micke on their album \\" A Family Affair \\", and on and on she got stronger, and she started healing.  Per continued to chug along, releasing album after great album, invigorated with the sparkle and pizzazz of Helena by his side, but MARIE SADLY WASN'T ALONG FOR THE RIDE.  THE JOYRIDE HAD STOPPED, PEOPLE!!!<br />  But for the past 2 years, Marie slowly started appearing on stage with Per.  Singing a few songs at first, then more, then more, then more... until it was finally announced that A NEW ROXETTE ALBUM WOULD BE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY 2011.  Just like I had lost faith in the World Wrestling Federation after \\" Stone Cold \\" Steve Austin retired, I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO HOPE THAT ROXETTE WOULD BE SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD AGAIN.  But THEY ARE BACK.  Older, wiser, stronger, with more hope, with a new sound, back to spread their love to us, their adoring fans... ready to conquer the world, ONE MORE TIME!<br />  This album is more mellow and \\" Adult \\" then all the other ones before it.  SIMPLY PUT, THEY HAVE MATURED.  They are 50 now, not 25 anymore, but they have really come into their own as musicians.  Every song on this album is a little piece of the Roxette that came before it, a few are a little weak but overall, just like a jigsaw puzzle, the album fits like a silk glove and it is their strongest since \\" Crash! Boom! Bang! \\" IMHO.  It is a shame that it has been 10 years since their last full-length album, and 4 years since \\" One Wish \\" and \\" Reveal \\", BUT ANYONE WHO IS A FAITHFUL, DIE-HARD ROXETTE FANS KNOWS WE WOULD RATHER DIE FIRST THEN FORGET ROXETTE.  ROXETTE IS AN INSTITUTION, PART OF EVERY ROXETTE FAN'S SOUL.  They don't call us \\" those crazy Roxette fans! \\" for nothing after all!  ROXETTE IS BACK, I'M DRESSED FOR SUCCESS, SURRENDER TO THE JOYRIDE EVERYBODY, SAY HOW DO YOU DO TO YOUR NEIGHBOR, GET A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS AND SHOW THE WORLD YOU HAVE STILL GOT THE LOOK, WOO-HOO!!!E!!!

B0002HYHSW|5.0|I bought this and several other games for a family member who suffered a stroke. Their right side was deeply affected. I found that this game was fun and highly effective occupational therapy. The whole family, 6 - 74 years old, played this in the hospital room. I can't say enough good things about this simple game. It should be noted that this game wont work on a smooth surface. I keep a wash cloth in the box and play the game on it. Also, this game is too difficult for children under three.
1400052173|5.0|I had heard and read quite a bit about this book before I picked it up for myself.<br />I think if I could count the hours, ( I had it read in under 2 days,) it added up to maybe 8 hrs total.<br /><br />It is a book that leaves a lasting impression.<br />  I think it should be on high schools reading lists everywhere.<br />Anyone who works in science, anyone who values what science has revealed to us so far.<br /><br />  It carries quite a punch.<br />I am thrilled that finally this woman and her family can enjoy the gift her life gave us all.<br />thank you Henrietta !  Go HeLa!
B000008JI1|3.0|I used to have this on tape years ago and found it on sale on Amazon.com. It is an ok disc from Poison, songs are very different from the last disc. Guitarist is much better than original.
B000002GBB|5.0|Fantastic
B004FOA84A|5.0|loved this game, was fun and truly challenging. My husband and I played it together. however just wish it was a lot longer, or like had a sequel. For 2$ I expected it to go a little longer, other than that, I wanna see more. this was fun!!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|I remember hearing about Pandorum, but I didn't honestly think I would enjoy it *this* much!  It's an awesome style of science fiction and horror combined.     It's about a man who has to escape from a spaceship where evil looking Mortal Kombat-like monsters roam the hallways (like the Sheeva character, specifically) searching for fresh human meat.  Actually those creatures remind me more of something from Quake II, one of my favorite 1st person games ever for the Playstation.    Anyway, the objective here is that the man has to reach the reactor in time, or all hope is completely lost.      Upon the way he meets up with a woman who's obviously mastered the fighting skills required to survive such a dreaded dark place, and another man who assists and jumps in at all the appropriate moments.    The man also frequently communicates with his commander, who has his own side story and personal demons.  Eventually his story becomes the center of attention.  I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've ever played Dino Crisis 2, you may notice a connection here, storyline-wise.      The main part of the storyline is, of course, the man (and his new friends) trying desperately to escape from the clutches of the dangerous monsters.  Now what makes these monsters a little more vicious than most is how *relentless* they are in their pursuit.  Also, the moment you see a blue light at the end of a hallway, that's a sign the monsters are right around the corner.  I LOVE the atmosphere here.  It's awesome.    I really appreciate the writers who worked on this film- they wrote a storyline that's not only understandable, but enjoyable from beginning to end, with lots of suspense and great acting.  I admit though, at first I thought the acting would stink, but it eventually improves just as soon as the action picks up.    Great film.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful and touching movies I've ever seen, based on a true story.  I recommend having a box of tissues handy. Believe me, it even made a grown man cry.

B000OPO6VU|5.0|Loved this album back in the summer of 1972 and I can still easily listen to it today. Trilogy could very well have the most beautiful assortment of melodies on any ELP album. \\"The Endless Enigma\\" and the title track \\"Trilogy\\" would have been enjoyed by Chopin or Tchikovski if they heard them back in the day. Although 1973's Brain Salad Surgery is considered by most to be the defining moment for ELP, this wonderful precursor released the year prior will always be my personal favorite.       I should also add that ALL of the Shout Factory ELP remasters from 2008 sound fantastic........ except for Brain Salad Surgery. For some strange reason, Shout Factory was provided with a muddy and muffled copy tape of \\"BBS\\" for their 2008 release. However, this remaster of Trilogy from Shout Factory is absolutely wonderful!!
B003EV6DBM|1.0|I just found Dr. Who Series 1 and was completely blown away by it. I eagerly searched out and fell in love w/Series 2,3, and 4. Not being burdened with knowledge of the entire series (all the 60's, 70's, and 80's Dr. Who) I had no preconceived notions about it. But I was totally sucked into the story from the very first episode and figured Series (Season) 5 would be a continuation of that. Imagine my thrill when I finally got my hands on Series 5. And then what a totally let down.    I get that the Doctor changes his personality with each regeneration. But what I don't get is why he has become an arrogant, unamusing jerk and worse, completely lost his mind with his new companion. Amy is clingy, whiny, unfun, and emotionally cheats (and wants to physically cheat) on her fiance. Why would anyone want to be around a person like this? For the first time I was watching Dr. Who and cheering on the Weeping Angels (or anyone!) to kill the companion because she is so awful and annoying. And the Doctor is annoying for championing her!    With Series 1 - 4 I've laughed and cried and totally gone into the Who Universe. With Series 5 I've turned off the TV because it is just boring, super-hero posturing pap. No emotional resonance, no laughing, no crying but lots of boredom and the hope that the bad guys will kill these two self-absorbed twits as soon as possible. Exterminate!
1594202842|5.0|I think any parent who wants the best for their children should read this book. Of course, I don't agree completely with all of Chua's radical parenting, but if you think about it, she puts lots of parents (myself included) to shame.  This woman, a very successful and extremely busy law professor (she's not exactly a stay-at-home housewife) devoted virtually ALL of her free time to both of her children to have them excel in music and academics.  I guess the \\"lessons\\" in parenting that one can garner from this book is her sheer devotion and selflessness as a mother.  This is starkly contrasted with the \\"western\\" moms - letting their 4-year olds run amok in public with their binkies while she chit-chats with the other housewives and sips her mocha-chino...or they \\"western dad\\", who goes bowling, golfing, and plays poker with his buddies every weekend.  Of course, I'm using extreme examples and these comparisons are just \\"tongue-in-cheek\\"...  :-)    Some of the other things that I agree with are disdain for waste of time activities like school plays, soccer, etc.  I think lots of western kids are way over-scheduled with too many activities, and consequently, end up mediocre (or bad) at lots of different things, and never excellent at just one thing.  Chua, on the other hand, closely monitored her kid's piano and violin studies and consequently, they became among the best in the state and within their peer group.  These activities also stimulate the mind and cause them to excel at academics - unlike all of these western \\"soccer kids\\" who play soccer just to \\"feel good about themselves\\" while they collect their 10th place trophies and their parents slather them with undeserved praise.  She made excellent points as well that western kids, despite all of the emphasis on self esteem by their western parents aren't necessarily \\"happy\\", and aren't necessarily devoted sons or daughters when their parents age.    All-in-all, this is an excellent memoir for people and readers open-minded enough to see how other cultures work.  Again, this is only a memoir - not a parenting guide or slam against western parenting.  Read this if you are a parent seeking advice on how to raise successful children.  Chua's formula obviously worked.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The title of the book doesn't tell you what you may be getting.  It isn't until you begin to read that you begin to realize the depth of this book.  You will become fascinated with the story and the complexity of the characters.  I wanted to continue to discover more about the characters and where their lives may ultimately lead, their future connections and events in their lives.
B004S8NBDI|3.0|While some claim that this is a new evolutionary phase in The Strokes music, I find that they overstretched it and got a little too experimental with this album. I agree with some of the previous reviewers that stated that some of the songs are simply unlistenable. In my opinion, \\"You're So Right\\" has no business on this album whatsoever. I mean, I skip over it - it's just so awful. Especially considering it's right after the best songs on the album, the single \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" and \\"Two Kinds of Happiness.\\"    Anyway, the Strokes typically make me bop my head and want to dance, iTunes-commercial style. Only a few songs did that for me on this album and that makes me sad :(    Make sure to preview before you buy.

0765326353|4.0|The Way of Kings is the first novel of an expected ten in the Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. The rather complex plot revolves, at least so far, around a conflict between the dominant empire of the time and what they see as a group of savages, fought over a massive series of disconnected plateaus called the Shattered Plains. But the novel isn't really about the war, nor is there a lot of fighting or battle scenes. Instead, the novel focuses on building up an incredibly complex, imaginative and realistic world, and populating it with a wide array of people and magic.    There are quite a few main characters, but the novel focuses more on three particular ones. The first, Kaladin, is a former spearman turned slave, who is sold into a bridge crew, whose mission is to carry portable bridges into battle to allow the troops to cross from plateau to plateau, which is, in effect, a death sentence as the unprotected bridgemen are regularly struck down by enemy arrows. Kaladin struggles through depression, regret and hopelessness and he tries to find a way to save both himself and the other bridgement. Dalinar is the king's uncle, struggling with his sanity as he suffers from repeated hallucinations that weaken his position as the fractious princes  jockey for power and influence. Shallan is a timid girl forced out into the world by necessity, with a dangerous goal in mind, who becomes enmeshed with one of the great scholars of the time. Sanderson typically excels in three things. The first is character development. He has the remarkable ability to create incredibly real and complex characters, and he can plumb the depths of human emotion with aplomb. Some might be put off by the fact that the main characters tend, on the whole, to be good people, so those who prefer grayer main characters may want to look elsewhere.    The second thing that Sanderson excels at in the Way of Kings is in world building. I recall another review referring to the world Sanderson built as a character unto itself. After reading the Way of Kings, I can honestly say that the world is the most fascinating aspect of the novel. It's incredibly complex and rich, but shares very little in common with Earth. It has unique wildlife and plantlife that are vividly described. Yet, most importantly, it all makes sense. Some authors create weird creatures just to have something different, but in no way do they seem plausible. Everything Sanderson creates seems like it could be real.     The third thing that Sanderson excels at in the Way of Kings is the development of his magic systems. This praise, like the others, is typical of a Sanderson work. He consistently manages to create unique and fascinating magic systems that are, at the same time, extremely well-constructed and follow very specific rules. This isn't vague, unexplainable power or amorphous waves of magic being thrown across a battlefield. The magic system isn't, perhaps, as well defined and manageable as was the alomancy system in Sanderson's Mistborn series, but it is still very well done.    Sanderson doesn't do anything badly in the Way of Kings, but some areas are less spectacular than others. Pacing has never been Sanderson's strong suit. As with his other novels, the first 75% of the novel seems to plod on before blitzing to a conclusion in the last couple hundred pages. This weakness is more noticeable in the 1000 page Way of Kings, where it seems like 700-800 pages plod on before coming to a screeching conclusion. Although I enjoyed every page of the novel, the Way of Kings definitely moved very slowly for quite a while. A large part of this is, perhaps, that he spends so much time developing his world and his characters that he puts plot development to the side. The novel probably could have been a much tighter, more evenly paced 800-850 pages. Further, because Sanderson doesn't seem to focus too much on plot, there were very few surprises. In fact, pretty much all of the major plot turns were fairly predictable.    As I mentioned at the start, the Way of Kings is the first novel in a planned 10 novel series. If each one weighs in around 1000 pages, you are looking at a major time commitment. After reading the Way of Kings, and having read five other Sanderson novels, I have little doubt that the series will be worthwhile. If nothing else, I can't wait to spend more time in the world Sanderson built. I'm giving the Way of Kings four stars, primarily because the pacing was far, far too slow and uneven and because the novel was rather predictable, but keep in mind that the Way of Kings really is just a protracted introduction. There is so much more coming, and Sanderson has laid the ground work for a truly remarkable series.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Pictures and gameplay are great, but it makes Samsng Epic 4G freeze. Even after I shut it down the phone froze. Had to pull my battery to unfreeze.
B004EI2NM2|1.0|This film was such a huge disappointment as I'd read lots of positive reviews and it had screened at soem fantastic queer festivals. Unfortunately, t tries way too hard to conform to some warped version of psychoanalysis and ends up being uninteresting in the extreme with characters that you don't care about. Without anything at stake except whether they'll stay together or not, the argument becomes very circular and repetitive for the viewer.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is the 4th product I have purchased from Satechi, and every one of them have been of superb quality and worked as advertised.  I have purchased 2 Sound Fly's and an external battery for charging I-pods, MP3 players, and cell phones. I also have the remote control for my Canon Rebel.  So far everything I have bought from Satechi has performed flawlessly.     Satechi will do more business with me in the future. They build after market equipment for various products like cameras, and mp3 players.  After 4 products in a year and absolutely no problems, I highly recommend this company's products.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|Smart.  He always was.He spent a lot of $ &   effort to throw this party but the payoff   is amazing.Everybody shines - this is how   great musicians do it; how they astound   us!    Ever since i heard Jeff play   \\"Greensleaves\\" on a scratchy ole  turntable back in the 60's i've admired  him.He just keeps getting better & this   will certainly be 1 of(if not) the best   live performances of the year. Get it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a new iteration of Angry Birds with an interesting twist.  Instead of bashing into rocks, glass, woods to smash the pigs, your new goal is to break out your fellow birds from their cages.  However the mechanics of flinging the birds are still the same and the difficulty is on par with the original Angry Birds and easier than Seasons.<br /><br />The game still works the same but with much better graphics and slightly different theme music (admit it, that song was getting a little old).<br /><br />I was able to install Amazon Appstore (sue me, Apple!) onto Droid X, rooted Nook Color and Nexus One (AT&T).  Once the Appstore is installed, Angry Birds Rio downloaded and installed just like Android Marketplace, and the game runs smoothly on all three devices.<br /><br />No doubt a free version will be release in the Official Android Marketplace in the future, but this paid one has no ads (that I have seen so far) and that alone is well worth the $0.99 to me.<br /><br />Whole-heartedly recommend. GET IT!!!
B001H9JBW6|4.0|I didn't really know what I was getting into when I started watching \\"The Last Enemy\\".  I actually thought it was stand alone DVD, not a multi-disc miniseries.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it went on for multiple episodes.  By the end of the first episode I was hooked.<br /><br />Without giving any details away, the gist of the main storyline is that entities in the government in Great Britain are working to implement T.I.A. (Total Information Access), a network of data feeds that includes banks, stores, transportation systems, surveillance cameras, and any data source that requires the use of an ID card, bank card, etc.  This is being done to increase statewide security against the possibility of terrorist activities, etc.  Of course, this kind of total info access can be used for all kinds of agendas...<br /><br />...enter our main character, a world renowned Mathematician who has been out of country for several years, living more or less in isolation, to attend a funeral.  When he gets home he discovers that there have been MANY changes in his absence. And so the story begins.<br /><br />As the story progresses you won't know which way to turn, who is on whose side, and what everyone is after.  This is top-flight made-for-TV drama and suspense.<br /><br />I have to admit that I did not care personally for some of the interpersonal situations that were presented from time to time, though one did add to the storyline.<br /><br />This is a not too futuristic version of Big Brother is Watching.  The acting is strong, and the story line is engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a very good offering, I can recommend it, with just a a few personal reservations.<br /><br />4 stars.
1439152780|4.0|I am a fan of Kate Morton's novels and eagerly awaited the release of this book. True to form, she has delivered a dark, gothic story around three sisters and their strange history. What I loved the most about the book was the scenery. I felt like I was living in England. The beginning is somewhat slow but if you keep going it will pick up. The ending was not what I expected but that is probably a good thing.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Disney's \\"Secretariat\\" brings back the excitement I remember the world feeling back in 1973, when we met Penny and her amazing Big Red.  Reliving the unbelievable Belmont finish as he surged further and further from the field was like seeing Pegasus flying and soaring up to the heavens.  Thanks for the memories. I'd recommend this movie for all horse lovers and anyone who vaguely remembers the great Secretariat's amazing campaign of 1973 - this'll bring it all excitingly back to you.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Developer's have so much hardware potential yet make games that can't even follow their own physics and attract the lowest common denominator.  This game and all angry bird games fail.  All they do is create addiction by activation in each level that fails their own game mechanics.  Its hillarious how such a horribly designed game can sell millions.  Says a lot about the modern consumer.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it. Hours of fun. Definately recommend it. xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo
0062064304|5.0|Lots of really great concept work in this book. I would definitely recommend it to any one who liked the art style of the movie and wanted to see more about the process. There are plenty of examples of iteration showing how the art evolved into it's final incarnation. If you like sci fi art, concept art, and this movie then you will probably like the book as much as I did.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this new version. Better graphics, good music, new critters (love the spazzy monkeys!) - a huge upgrade from the original version. I miss the pigs, but am enjoying the tons of new levels to conquer. Totally addictive!
B004J00QLU|2.0|As long as your phone is android 2.2+ there's really any need for this. Android manages your resources, when your phone needs to, it kills a process to start a new one. It's how the operating system works, and it actually works well. Stick with all the other reviewers, and stay away from task killers. You can already go and kill programs individually in settings>applications. Religiously killing tasks, thinking you're making your phone last longer...is a mistake, a big one. A lot of developers actually think, at this point(android 2.2+), they do more harm than good. If you find some comfort in having one of these on your phone, at least go with one with some nice additional features like advanced task killer...But i'll say it again, try to stay away from task killers.<br /><br />Droid X
B004SBS8LA|5.0|And its another classic. Rovio strikes gold again with their latest installment of Angry Birds. If you enjoyed the others, you will love this.<br />Get it while its still free only on Amazon!
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Great software, not sure it's worth it for everyone. This is one of the first apps I bought when I got an android phone. It works wonderfully, best i've seen for editing documents, as it says, \\"on the go.\\" The steep price tag should probably scare a lot of people away. There are other viewers, and although I find this to be the best editor, how often do you edit documents on your phone. Theres a certain niche group of people this has got to be amazing for. And I don't regret my purchase even a little. App works great, just a warning to think about if you're actually going to get the $15 out of the app before you pull the trigger.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|its soundgarden, come on !!!!  blows this crap kids are listening to today away.  just bought live on i-5, great addition to the music collection
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is incredible, especially for the price. If you like to doodle whatsoever, buy this app. The amount of features, and how well they work, i'm impressed. Never thought i'd be working with layers on my phone. And I can't say i've created any mobile masterpieces yet, but if you take the time..the tools are finally there to create something i'd actually consider art, on your phone. Can export the file, maintaining the layers, and work on it in photoshop later. I couldn't be more pleased with this app.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|overall a really fun &amp; addicting angry birds game with some new twists! it has frozen &amp; crashed on me but otherwise a great game!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Great for quick fun, and such a good use for the touch screen. It's simple, but I actually think it looks really good for what it is. It's smooth, and it's well responsive. I'd get it if you ever need something to kill time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|very addictive my girl is obessed with this game. couldnt get my samsung epi..c off her hands. there are 3 different games for angry birds
B004J4WQ46|2.0|I have been a strokes fan for a good while now, and i love when bands try new things. However what the hell were they trying to do!!! this sounds like all their music into one, only thing is it does not work very well. I have listened to the new album about ten times, and i do not find it very good. The lyrics are something a child could write. I am happy i downloaded the mp3 version of the album for 3.99. Even at that great price i feel that this album would have been better as an ep. The strokes have so much talent and should have worked harder on this album. They cheated their fans big time.
B00006AUIG|2.0|A serious disappointment considering all the positive reviews. If you want to watch a VERY average B horror movie.......this one is for you.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I've been playing Steve Jackson Games since I discovered Car Wars in 1981 and this game  fits well into their tradition of inexpensive, portable, high production value, well-playtested games.    It plays a lot like a twisted version of Yahtzee.  Roll the dice, count the brains of your victims,  but don't push your luck too far or you'll catch one too many bullets to the head.  We found that   role-playing the results of your dice throw adds a lot to the enjoyment.    I also recommend checking out Penny Arcade's PATV season one (not sure which episode) when they filmed themselves playing this instead of making the comic like they should have been doing.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Edited review: Game is fine, the HTC Desire cannot install apps on its SD card, so the HTC Desire runs out of storage room pretty fast.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thank you amazon for the amazing and fun game. I would definitely recommend this game. It is very similar to the original game, but it has a better design and better graphics.also you are no longer killing pigs instead you are rescuing birds.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about the formatting of this bundle -- my copy has a TOC at the front with links to each book and has a separate TOC for the chapters of each book -- so it seems like everyone else's probably has this too.  When you open the bundle for the first time on your Kindle, it doesn't take you to the actual beginning of the book (I've found this to be true of basically all Kindle books -- what it considers \\"the beginning\\" skips the cover, table of contents, forwards, etc.).  If you use \\"Go to\\" on the menu and then choose \\"Cover\\" (again, something I do at the start of every Kindle book), you will be brought to a picture of the box set.  Three page turns brings you to the Contents page, which has links to the cover pages of all 4 books, as well as the bundle cover, title page, and the bonus material at the end (including the excerpt from [[ASIN:B003YL4LYI A Dance with Dragons]]).  If you don't choose a link from this page and instead turn 4 or 5 more pages or so (through the title and copyright pages), you'll come to the TOC for the first book.  I would think that it probably doesn't give TOC as a choice on the Go To menu because there is more than one table of contents to choose from!    In addition, as you can see on the bottom progress bar, the start of each book is marked with a dot on the bar.  So you can judge your progress through a particular book by seeing how far away you are from the next dot.  Also, from the cover pages in the beginning, if you hit the right arrow on the directional pad, you will be taken right to the cover page of the next book.  Hitting the left arrow takes you back to the start of the previous book.  This will work from any cover page.  If you are in the text of the book itself, hitting the left or right arrow takes you to the start of the next or previous chapter.  If you have a Kindle 2, you would push the 5-way controller left or right.    I haven't begun reading this bundle yet (though I have read all the books previously -- twice), so I can't comment on the text of the actual bundle -- though of course the books themselves are fantastic!  I have browsed through it, though, so I can tell you that the maps are all there as well as picture covers for each book as well as a picture of the box set.  The beginning pages of each chapter all have an illustrated border at the top, and the text itself looks great (no problems with text formatting that I can tell).      I also can't complain about the price, since I preordered this for $17.99, which was a great deal for all 4 books.  I would agree that the price is kind of high now, but it's really pretty much the same as the 4 books separately in Kindle editions.  As it says at the top of the product page, the price was set by the publisher -- not Amazon.    So, in summary, I really don't see the problems that the other reviewers are pointing out.  If you are wanting all 4 books for your Kindle, either because you haven't read them before or because you want your next re-read to be in Kindle format, this is a great way to get them!    Edit 3/31/11:  Amazon has updated this book set, and there is now a link in the Go To menu for table of contents, which brings you to the page at the front with clickable links to each book.  This page was already there, but now you can get to it from the Go To menu instead of having to go to Cover and page forward.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love Jillian!  I have this video, her yoga meltdown, and recently purchased her new video Ripped in 30.  They are all fantastic.  The new Ripped in 30 however, is not a 20 minute workout - I don't care what she says.  I timed it and it lasts 37 minutes.  But, I have gotten so used to this DVD and her new one that I think I would be bored to death if I got back on the treadmill!  This DVD keeps you changing it up so much that you don't realize how fast the time goes.  She's incredibly motivational.  As far as the annoying introduction to this DVD, what I do is put the DVD in and then while the intro is on I go get changed into my workout clothes and shoes and by the time I'M ready so is the DVD.
0802798225|2.0|I was rather disappointed in this high school romance between two kids from different backgrounds. She is white, rich and seemingly perfect, he is Mexican, poor and in a gang. Both however are facing difficult situations in their current lives and have pain and frustration in their hearts.<br />This sounds like a very interesting premise, but the book didn't actually deliver.<br /><br />First of all, this book is leaden with stereotypes, which diminished my respect both for the characters and the author.  Also, the pace was really slow, so much so in fact that by the time the romance was beginning to bud between the protagonists, I was beginning to lose my interest.<br />However, my greatest problem was with the romance between them.<br />It felt so fake, so contrived and so shallow.<br />If you know what I mean, that kind of ruined the whole thing for me. I couldn't believe that they really cared for each other, except in a few instances, which however were soon ruined by their sappy lines afterwards.<br /><br />I had heard so many good things about this book, so maybe my expectations were too high. I have kept the book in my bookshelf, however. It wasn't horrible, just not all it was cracked up to be. (And I really hated the cover which didn't help at all.)<br /><br />Rating: 2/5<br /><br />this review first appeared on my blog<br />[...]
0684847817|5.0|Fun to flip through. Others like the information / stories. I bought more for studying the drawing/sketching techniques. Well suited for either, or both, pursuits.
0312370849|4.0|There is plenty of meat for book club discussions in this historical fiction set in Paris. An ex-pat American author goes through a marriage crisis as she discovers the shocking truth about her Paris apartment and her philandering husband. I could not put the book down, but I think younger readers who are not &lt;cough> \\"a certain age\\" (like me) will not feel the connection with the protagonist, Julia Jarmond. Very educational about the WWII deportations without being too preachy - although I admit it is one-sided.
1590171993|5.0|I'd not heard of John Williams before the latest edition of Stoner was released, but I am very glad this version made its way to my Kindle. The fact that it is set at the University of Missouri (my alma mater) in the first half of the last century piqued my interest, but it was the story and the characters that drew me in and made me think. There are no fireworks in this story, except perhaps the love affair at its heart, but the author manages to create interest and even excitement in the context of the mundane work of life. The description of the ultimate and tragic loss of emotional intimacy between the father and daughter is heartbreaking, and the final pages are among the finest I've ever read about the end of life. Some reviewers have said that the description of Stoner's wife, Edith, is overdrawn, and I found it difficult to fathom at times. A book from her perspective of her life with Stoner would be fascinating, if only Williams was still around to write it! I can't recommend this novel highly enough.
B004INNRFK|5.0|I saw the first David Foster and Friends. I am a music lover. If a love a song I want to know who wrote it and produced it. The ones behind the scenes do not get the credit until it is awards time. David Foster has a magic touch in the 70s to today and the music is timeless.     Earth Wind and Fire    Michael Jackson    Seal    Michael Buble    Whitney Houston    Barbara Streisand    Donna Summer    The list goes on and on.    Read Hitman and get the first dvd cd.    You will not be disappointed.
B004LP601S|5.0|In comparison to their last cd, this one is so much better. I enjoy all of the songs, and I am glad Panic is back into making the type of music they did on their first CD. Their previous one, for me didn't sound well and I believe they lost some fans because of it. I suspect the two members that left were the cause of the change. I want to hear Panic, not a band trying to sound like The Beatles. If you aren't sure if you should buy this because of their last CD, I can say it will not be a waste of money.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|I was really looking forward to this movie which I ordered online. It has a really good story, good acting from the main lead actress and the vallians, and you will never guess that, other than the story, the rape scene was very realistically made. But the best part of the movie was not the rape scene, but the torture of the 4 guys, who sexually assaulted and conducted the rape. The revenge and torture scenes were nothing that I have seen or thought of, 4 guys with different torture methods applied by the avenging angel, until death comes to them. Watch it and you will know what I mean.........
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Loved the game and graphics for the brief time I could play it.  Game froze after a couple of levels and locked up my Vibrant for 1 hour.  Maybe its a power hog, not sure.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better than regular angry birds or seasons The rio characters make it worth it also Best of all it's free you can't beat that with a stick lol
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|people have to be very bored or just have Bo life to write useless crap. Really,  you think that because you are one of the few who gave this a 1 star that everyone else is high? You are a tool.
B00000FC5H|5.0|What else can you say except that Earth, Wind, & Fire are a landmark group from which others measure up to: flawless execution, original songs with always a positive direction, the leadership of modest & genius Maurice White, enfin: a big band, big music, totally overshadowed by spirituality and philosophic conscienceness.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice, I got this for free, and not only that, but I'm going to keep Amazon's Apps, to see if theer is anything else on here I might like to buy..
B004SBS8LA|1.0|this is more a reflection of the amazon appstore, but after downloading, this app stopped working within an hour. after uninstalling, i could not re-download from the amazon appstore, and the open button is useless at that point
B004J4WQ46|5.0|This album is perhaps their best so far. One of the distinct vibes to it is that you feel that over the last 5 years The Strokes saw what they spawned in rock and have decided to come back and say, \\"No, this is how it done.\\" I wouldn't say its a slap against Vampire Weekend, The Kooks, The Artic Monkeys etc, more of a strict tutorial in greatness. \\"Angles\\" finds the band making a major statement, equal to the the ground breaking work of \\"Is This It\\". The first single, \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" (which is probably the greatest slice of classic Strokes sound ever) instantly grabs you by the throat. Opening track \\"Machu Picchu\\" lets the listener know that things have changed again and will probably never be the same. The Thin Lizzy-styled \\"Gratisfaction\\" has a glorious drunken chorus to it. \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight\\" is perhaps their most beautiful song ever. Nick and Albert have added more complexity to their guitar work and, frankly, Nick's solos really soar. Julian's vocals, mumbled as ever, seem to have found more range. This album was obviously more of a group effort and its better for it. NOW A WARNING: the casual listener is not going to \\"get\\" this ablum the first time they hear it. Much like \\"Is This It\\", the album grows on the listener and its complexity and variety will slowly take you over. To me, that is art.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The PJO series is my drug. Literally.  i am addicted to this thrilling, action packed and humorous book. Every moment was filld with excitement. It really is a masterpiece. If you want to read about greek mythology in an interesting way you should read this.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|My previous one-star review is below, but they've since fixed the Table of Contents issues and now all is well. Great books.<br /><br />I'll chime in with the other unhappy reviewers. This bundle is very difficult to navigate. You'd figure that the \\"Go to\\" would have an option for Table of Contents that would then allow you to select which book you wanted, but it doesn't. I want my money back.
0470876417|5.0|\\"You're holding a handbook for visionaries, game changes, and challengers striving to defy outmoded business models and design tomorrow's enterprises.\\"  Often, the promises of a front cover claim are unmet. Here they are met by tangible actions to produce the hard questions -- Questions that test your differentiations and identify what to do next.  It is a powerful work that also demonstrates how to facilitate the discussion with potential participants in your business and how to communicate your ideas visually.  This is an excellent book!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Doesn't offer any new mechanics. Just looks nicer. Was really hoping for a game changer. Hopefully it will come in later levels. Will keep checking back.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have Evernote on my Tablet, Ipod, Blackberry and PC.  I really love it, and keep lots of stuff on it.  Shopping lists are all done on it.  You can type it on your computer, modify if on a different device later if you need to, and use it on your mobile device in the store.  I keep recipes on it so you always have easy access.  At work one day I had an inspection that I needed to note the things to change.  I typed it on my Blackberry as the inspector noted things.  Once I was done, it was already on the computer... so it was simple to go to the office, clean it up on the computer, and then send it out to anyone that needed it.  Very useful in a ton of ways.

B004L49K20|5.0|This review is not so much for the music of AYNIN, which has already been discussed at length in other reviews, but rather for the value of your money for purchasing the deluxe edition of this new release.  Let me preface this by stating that last year I spent between $25 and $35 to purchase the deluxe re-issues of 7 and the Ragged Tiger, Notorious, and So Red the Rose, so comparing the deluxe edition of AYNIN to these discs is inevitable.  The re-issues came with two music discs, consisting of the all the tracks that originally appeared on the albums, in addition to bonus material, including live and alternate versions and B-sides, and a DVD.  The packaging also included booklets, and either mini-posters or nice quality photographs of the band.  At the time I pre-ordered this disc, the going price on Amazon was just a little over $18.  I knew it came with a DVD, and I knew there would be bonus tracks that were not availble when AYNIN was first released on iTunes last year.  It is for this reason that I held off on downloading the iTunes version of AYNIN.  By the date of release, the price of the deluxe version had dropped to $11.99, while the cost of the standard version was $13.68.  The standard version does not come with the DVD and only has 14 tracks (versus 15 on the deluxe version).  Why, oh why, would anyone spend MORE to get LESS?<br /><br />That being said, as a long-time fan, I would not have minded paying more to get more.  While watching the DVD, there was a segment where they discussed how the main tracks of the album came about, and hearing the raw acoustic early tracks the band laid down before adding layer upon layer of music to come up with the finished product, I couldn't help wishing there had been a third bonus disc containing those early stripped down versions, sort of like Juliet, Naked, for those familiar with the book by Nick Hornby.<br /><br />Also on the DVD there is a segment about a photo shoot that the band did for the album, yet there are absolutely no images of the band anywhere in the packaging (a three paneled fold-out case and a 22 page booklet).  Not one single fuzzy, blurry, grainy image.  Again, I would gladly have paid a little extra to have something from the photoshoot included.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, for $11.99 you really can't beat the content that's there.  I believe the original iTunes version of the \\"album\\" was somewhere in the neighborhood of $9.  For $2.99 more, you get six additional tracks, a DVD, and booklet featuring some nice photographic artwork with lyrics and liner notes.  If you're a fan (like me), it's definitely money well spent.  But like I said, I would I have been willing to pay a more to get a few more extras.<br /><br />As a side note, when I tried playing this on my computer at home, I was surprised that Media Player didn't recognize the .amz format, so I had to use iTunes.

B00008G7UJ|1.0|This was my first time ordering from Amazon. I ordered the DVD Romeo and Juliet, when it arrived, it was a totally different movie from the 1940's!  I was not a happy camper as I just spent over $400.00 on only a few items! Not a good way of trying to keep a good business and customers happy.
0143117009|3.0|I understand why the book appeals strongly to the environmental catastrophe-minded, and it covers quite a bit of interesting history in areas which are not often addressed, but overall it is lacking. When I first glanced at the table of contents I wondered why the author was remarkably selective in the collapses covered, but it is apparent afterwards. The societies discussed are what almost every reasonable historian would consider minor players in human history. Intense overpopulation in areas of limited resources is bound to create catastrophic problems- that's a no-brainer. Tracing every problem to environmental depredation is pretty short-sighted and hardly objective. Collapses of much larger and more important civilations could be covered and those failures are rather more complex issues.

B004KAB43I|4.0|Sometimes when people want marriage and/or a career, life works out perfectly just the way they plan it.  More often than not, things are a little more challenging than the perfect plan.  Bridget is a little flighty, a little scattered, and a little gullible.  She is a combination of all the things we women are at our most insecure moments, and all the things we don't want people to know or see about us.    I enjoyed this book.  There were several laugh out loud moments that were such fun to read.  She isn't a poster child for womens' rights.  She is just a young adult who is trying to find her place in this world.  She doesn't know exactly what she wants to be, or whom she wants to partner her life with, but she has friends and family who love her.  She often finds herself lacking, but at the end of the day she picks herself up and keeps trying.    I recommend this book.  It isn't the kind of book that will change your life.  But it is the kind of story that will entertain you, make you smile, and perhaps remind you of some of the choices you've made in your own life that were less than perfect. Maybe you'll even be able to laugh at a few of your own mistakes.
B001HN694K|4.0|Given his flair for the whimsical, the surrealistic, and the preposterous, Tim Burton would seem the ideal choice to direct a modern movie version of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\" And turns out he is. (Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro, whose \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" was already a variant of sorts on the story, are two others who might have done as well).<br /><br />Lewis Carroll's darkly humorous Victorian Era classic chronicles the adventures of a spunky, imaginative young girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastic world of talking animals, size-altering potions, and memorably eccentric characters, a land ruled over by the evil, bulbous-headed Red Queen, played with petulant haughtiness by Helena Bonham Carter.  The screenplay for the film - now called simply \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - by Linda Woolverton draws from both \\"Wonderland\\" and its first sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" (as most previous film versions have done), and captures both the darkness and the humor of the material.<br /><br />All of Carroll's beloved creations are here, some played by actors in costumes and makeup, some generated entirely through CGI, and some - like The Red Queen - produced through a canny combination of the two.  There's the mad Mad Hatter (played by a typically loopy Johnny Depp), the growling Bandersnatch, the slyly smiling Cheshire Cat, the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the roly-poly twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which it has been prophesied Alice will slay, thereby liberating the people of the kingdom from their tyrannical queen.<br /><br />Burton breathes new life into this oft-told and oft-filmed tale thanks to a team of visual and special effects wizards who come as close to capturing the world of Carroll's imagination as any group of filmmakers could ever be expected to, given the enormity of the challenge.<br /><br />As the heroine who must learn to accept the impossible before she can know who she truly is, Mia Wasikowska manages to keep Alice life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.<br /><br />A masterpiece of art direction, costume design and special effects, this \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is the next best thing to the books themselves.ce life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.

I think Neal Whittle's debut novel is a much superior read....a real WOW!!! He writes from the deep conviction that,if we have the courage to discover our own inner magic and the determination to believe in it,then....miracles are possible...the chief of which is that we can change things for the better,maybe starting with ourselves.

0618918248|5.0|From my perspective, the two most remarkable things about this book have nothing to do with its subject matter.  Sure, the facts are compelling, and the arguments are convincing, but he's arguing against religion, an easy target for any well-educated person.  The two remarkable things are these:  (1) the book reflects an incredible display of patience and persistence by Mr. Dawkins, and (2) the book reflects a calm, careful method of presentation that many modern public intellectuals would be well-advised to emulate.  As for the first, Mr. Dawkins calmly and patiently addresses a large number of the key counterpoints raised by believers.  He recites those counterpoints accurately and then proceeds to explain why he rejects them, all in great detail, over numerous chapters.  Debates between atheists and believers are often fruitless, maddening and frustrating, yet he repeatedly jumps deeply into this fray, not only in this book, but in lectures and appearances around the world.  His patience and persistence in tackling these matters is impressive to say the least (particularly when one considers that writing about religion is hardly Mr. Dawkin's day job).  Atheists who believe that religion is, on balance, harmful, owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Dawkins because he has taken up the difficult task of trying to persuade believers to reconsider.  In this view, his work is a compassionate and patient effort to help.  As for the second remarkable thing, it is the calm, intelligent method of presentation of facts and argument in the book.  Society would improve if folks emulated his technique  -- one dedicated to frank and specific explanations of positions, and honest and full responses to counterpoints without obfuscation or evasion.  The book is worth reading on this point alone.  A final note.  I found this book entertaining, so much so, that it was hard to put down.  It's difficult to say why.  It has a charm, an honesty, and a humor that together conspire to make an entertaining read.  Solid 5 star book.ntertaining read.  Solid 5 star book.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I grew up watching the Muppet and Disney versions of the story and even remember watching the Albert Finney version with my mom as well.  I thought I knew the story pretty well.  I mean, I knew that the ghost of Christmas present struggled pronouncing pistachio, I knew that there was a funny rat.  I had no doubt that I knew all that there was to know about the Christmas Carol, but I decided to read it anyway.<br />Boy was I in for a surprise (insert sarcasm here).  I'm not gonna lie, this was a hard read.  It wasn't because of the content or writing ability of Dickens, but it was the language barrier.  Sometimes I swear it was like I was reading a different language.  It took a while for me to read some parts and I had to use the wonderful dictionary feature of the Kindle many, many times.<br />I did enjoy the story and it is incredible how Dickens can describe even the most mundane details and make them interesting.  I could see the ghost of Christmas past's flame, I could hear Marley's chains and see the shock on Scrooge's face when he sees his own grave.  Dickens is incredible at painting pictures with words.<br />After reading this book I saw the newer animated Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey as Scrooge and I was very impressed at how well they brought the actual story to life.  There were some differences, but overall they did a magnificent job.<br />Definitely a good read during the Christmas season or any time really, whenever you need to remember that we should value other people and treat them as we want to be treated.<br /><br />If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website.

0345529057|5.0|I stumbled across this page and saw a handful of 1-star reviews that left me puzzled. Then I realized that all of them were regarding the supposedly-poor quality of the Kindle version. Well, I can't tell you anything about the Kindle version. I'm one of those old-school guys, so I bought the paperback set, and it's undoubtedly worth the money. Obviously, the content is 5-star worthy (see the reviews for each individual book), so I'm going to limit my review to the box set itself. This set contains each of the first four books in the Song of Ice and Fire Series (that's A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows), with all-new cover artwork. Out of all the versions released, this is the most visually enrapturing artwork yet. The novels are brightly colored and contain designs that are brilliant in their simplicity. The outer box contains some high-quality shots from the upcoming HBO series.    Highly recommended for:  -Someone who's never read A Song of Ice and Fire. This is the place to start, and a great value too (4 loooong books for $23).  -Longtime fans whose old paperback copies are worn from reading and re-reading in anticipation of A Dance With Dragons.  -Hardcore series collectors who want to own the best versions.    I lent my older copies of this series to my ex-girlfriend, and since I never got them back, I decided that this box set was a worthy purchase. I'm so satisfied with it, I can honestly say that I don't miss the books I lost, not even one bit. I've posted some pictures of the box set so you can decide for yourself if you like its look enough to drop the money.

I loved  the feeling of how we got to pierce through the impenetrable air of the King of England, and see the challenges he faced overcoming his impediment.  Geoffrey Rush was a joy to watch, and Colin Firth truly deserved the oscar... Helena Bonham Carter was a treat!

B003Y74AXO|5.0|This is a good idea to protect your ipad screen.  It includes a cleaning cloth and the plastic screen cover.  I found I needed some solution to go along with the cleaning cloth though -- I have some for LCD displays and it worked well.  Without that it was difficult to get the screen clean.  Once clean, you then pull the protective cover off of the piece of plastic and line it up on the ipad.  That's actually a bit tricky, especially without touching the now-exposed sticky part.  After several minutes of trying, I got that down and got the air bubbles out, then peeled the top cover, and it works.  It has a nice glare free surface.  And it will protect against scratching the actual screen.  Good investment

B00000JBFW|4.0|Marking the return of the MK II lineup, Deep Purple returned after being on hiatus for nine years. Gillan and Glover rejoined the band as Coverdale, Hughes, and Bolin were no longer present. The classic lineup released Perfect Strangers back in 1984. Does it live up to the albums of the 70's? Yes AND No. Several fusions of the standard 80's rock style are evident in most of the songs, and the hard rock/funk style that the band has been known for in the 70's seems minimal. Plus, the music on this album seems fairly generic, causing some of the songs to sound very mediocre. I mentioned before that there's nothing wrong with rock bands experimenting new music. Here, however, DP doesn't seem to even try to relish in their fresh 80's sound. Yes, Perfect Strangers isn't perfect, but I will admit that it's still a very good one from MK II. It's not great, but it's far from being bad. The guitar, bass, keyboard, drums, and vocals are still solid. There are still some very nice moments in songs such as \\"Nobody's Home\\" and \\"A Gypsy's Kiss.\\" \\"Mean Streak\\" is your typical classic DP. The 10-minute instrumental \\"Son of Alerik\\" is one that shouldn't be missed out on.<br /><br />I never thought I would give a grade lower than an 8 for a Deep Purple album, but here I have to.

It's a greatest hits album, but all songs are re-recorded with full orchestra. Joni has a different voice now. More like a jazz singer. And it works so well with her songs. It's a great CD and if you feel any hesitation about buying it, please don't. You will love it!

I have kindle on my phone so it was super handy, I was reading at work, at home, while waiting in line.. I was done in 3 days.   He paints the pictures so well with his writing.

B004LP601S|2.0|This sounds too much like Fall Out Boy for my liking. A big reason why I didn't like \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\". \\"Pretty Odd\\" was a pleasant surprise with its Beatles influence, but this disc returns to the more Fall Out Boy sound, especially as far as the vocals go. I'm sorry, one Fall Out Boy is enough. Brendon Urie does a surprisingly decent job covering for the absence of Ross lyrically, but musically the cd falls flat and feels rather melancholy. Hopefully with Ross/Young Veins on hiatus, he'll make his return on the next cd and bring his influences with him, because Urie is obviously influenced by Mr. Wentz/company. Not suprising I guess, being he is signed to Wentz's label.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|The birth of an ugly baby? Who wants to watch this? Then a sliver of wanting to see where this was going crept in, then got totally immersed into this film! Almost, but not quite, a 1 kleenix film. Just got emotionally caught up and rode the wave. Thoroughly enjoyed! Would have liked to have seen the lightning chap go outside during that storm and gotten zapped for the 8th time, thereby going out in a blaze of glory. The Ending, sort of thought, once the water hit the clock, it would reverse and start going the correct way forwards. Overall, gives one that same feeling we get as we pass into old age, regretting the missed opportunities, enjoying the good rememberances, and missing the forgotten ones. 5 Stars, because I don't regret watching this movie! For those who didn't, time to warm up the stone hard, cold heart!

B0042RUMIW|5.0|I enjoyed this concert very much. It's great from the beginning with \\"A Thousand Years\\". On \\"Every Little Thing\\", Sting sticks with the original arrangement and the orchestra gives an energetic performance. I like this version as much as the original by The Police. One of the early highlights for me, was \\"Englishman In New York\\", with guest musician Branford Marsalis on saxaphone. Branford returned later, for the songs \\"Desert Moon\\" and \\"Mad About You\\". I was a little disappointed Branford didn't appear on more songs. His playing goes so well with Sting's music. I was fortunate to have seen him on Sting's NOTHING LIKE THE SUN tour in 1988.<br /><br />The version of \\"Roxanne\\" on this concert is quite different from the usual way Sting does the song, but it's still very good. \\"Russians\\" is another highlight. It was interesting to hear Sting's explanation of the inspiration for the song. The orchestral arrangement was very good, especially the intro, which made the song, though a little dated, even more powerful.  Sting introduced the \\"cowboy\\" song \\"I Hung My Head\\" by saying he was a fan of American westerns such as Gunsmoke, and \\"everyone's favorite\\" Bonanza. Being from Manchester and \\"not looking good\\" in a cowboy hat, he felt vindicated when Johnny Cash recorded that song.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed as much by the next few songs. I suppose I like hearing Stings more familiar songs from his Police years, and his first few solo albums, more so than his later works. I'm sure I will come to enjoy them more with each listen.<br /><br />The concert ends with some of my favorite songs, beginning with \\"King of Pain\\", and including another highlight, one of my favorite Sting songs,\\"Fragile\\".<br /><br />This is a great concert dvd. I've already listened to portions of it several times. Stings voice sounds great, and the orchestra and musicians, including Sting's longtime band members guitarist Dominic Miller and percussionist Rhani Krija, give an excellent performance. Vocalist Jo Lawry adds a nice touch with her backup vocals. The audio and video quality of the dvd are also excellent.<br /><br />The companion cd doesn't include all the songs on the dvd, but does include three songs* not heard on the dvd.<br /><br />track listing for the cd only;<br /><br />If I Ever Lose My Faith In You*<br />Englishman In New York<br />Fields Of Gold*<br />Why Should I Cry For You?<br />All Would Envy<br />Tomorrow We'll See<br />The End Of The Game<br />Whenever I Say Your Name<br />Shape Of My Heart*<br />Moon Over Bourbon Street<br />Mad About You<br />King Of Pain<br />Desert Rose<br />Fragile<br /><br /> If you like quality music, this set is a great choice.ch with her backup vocals.

6305428352|5.0|Mr Holland's Opus is a must see movie for anyone who loves music. It follows the life of a teacher and his family and shows the importance of music in our lives. While Mr Holland becomes an mentor and major influence on the lives of his students and members of the community, it shows his struggle with his family and dealing with his son who is deaf. I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I'm of the opinion that the movie is better than the book. Its exactly what I thought the book was and everything the book isn't. Everything is toned down from the grusome murders to the child molestation and confused gender. I should of skipped reading the book and simply waited for this to come out on DVD.

B0036TGSR6|2.0|Perhaps I lack sophistication, but I found this movie boring and stupid.<br /><br />The premise is intriguing: Ewan McGregor portrays a ghost writer recruited to write the memoir's of the former Prime Minister of England, played by a very charismatic, yet underused, Pierce Broslin. As this process get's going, the former leader incurs charges of cooperating with the CIA in illicit torture. Now the ghost writer is collaborating with an increasingly unpopular person that is attracting world wide damnation. As he learns more about his subject's life, he naturally also learns about his secrets as well. Coincidentally, Mcgregor is the second ghost writer, the first mysteriously died.<br /><br />Great set up yet this movie was so boring.<br /><br />Lets just assume that my inability to be entertained is my fault because I \\"don't get\\" subtle drama. Nevertheless, the movie's problems are compounded by a ridiculous and unbelievable love tryst between the ghost writer and Prime Minister's wife, too fast of a conflict resolution, shady characters that seem more out of \\"Bullwinkle\\" than real life and a climax that is absolutely cartoonishly preposterous.<br /><br />The great reviews of this movie are much ado about nothing.

B004M17ITO|4.0|Another one that a good going over was bound to happen, listened to it early this morning and it does sound very very good. I don't believe this one had the same problems the first two did with the muggy sound but it appears this one was tweaked somewhat from the last remaster. So again, I recommend it especially if you don't have this one, if you have it, maybe the bonus tracks might be of interest, anyway, I collect Queen so I got it for my own interests. Next review, A Night At The Opera, which I'm listening to now.<br />Visit my site sometime and say \\"Hi\\" @ Judemac Forever.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|Never been a Tyler Bates fan but the soundtrack to Sucker Punch not only captures the spirit and themes of the film brilliantly, it's a krusher from start to finish!  Though it feels more like an Emily Browning vehicle- in addition to being the star of the movie she performs three of the nine songs- it doesn't detract from anything. She's got a light, airy voice and can actually carry a note.  Beyond that, every cut here is a solid groove; there's not a weak one in the bunch.  This one was made for cranking up the volume!<br /><br /> Track Listing:<br />1) Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This): Mostly electro-acoustic version sung by Emily Browning to a slower, more atmospheric tempo with some nice beats in the background.<br /><br />2) Army Of Me (Sucker Punch Remix): Bjork teams up with Skunk Anansie for a new take on the old joint.  Gets progressively harder as it goes with some action oriented mashing dropped in before coming back to the remixed style.<br /><br />3) White Rabbit: What's an over-the-top psychedelic sci-fi/fantasy movie without this one?  Hot bassline, great drums, nifty guitar, layered vocals and synths- this one's a jam.  Plus Emiliana Torrini's accent makes me all tingly...<br /><br />4) I Want It All/We Will Rock You (Mash-Up): Never been a fan of rap metal, and not really a fan of this one. But the mix is pretty entertaining and Brian May drops a nice little riff in the midst of it all.<br /><br />5) Search & Destroy: Fast, furious and fun, Skunk Anansie delivers a left hook!  Somewhere in a trashed hotel room Iggy Pop is smiling.<br /><br />6) Tomorrow Never Knows: An impressive rendering of a Beatles classic by Alison Moorhat and Carla Azar.  Definitely finds its own groove while keeping the spirit of the original.<br /><br />7) Where Is My Mind: A Pixies remake that features another appearance by Emily Browning, accompanied by Israeli guitarist Yoav.  Starts slow but steadily picks up steam.  It's ok, but more for atmosphere than anything.<br /><br />8) Asleep: The third Emily Browning performance, this time doing The Smiths.  A little slower and more acoustic than the original, but good.<br /><br />9) Love Is The Drug: Oscar Isaac and Carla Guigino do a good job performing this one cabaret-style ala Liza Minelli and Joel Gray.  Obviously they were cast as much for their vocal talents as their acting.<br /><br />Gotta admit, I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.

B004M17IU8|4.0|Well, I have to tell ya, very good but as the remasters creep out, it appears they start to sound more the same as the original remastered disc's. I did think they sounded somewhat better though but if I was buying for the first time, I'd get these or if like myself, collected them, I'd get them. Probably the real find on this one is the bonus CD tracks. One though has been released before \\"Keep Yourself Alive Lost Retake\\" and the others well, nice to have in digital form. Love Of My Life (South American Live Single) makes it's digial debut here where it was previously released as a single. Well, in the long run, I recommend it, if not for the regular album then the bonus CD.<br />Drop by my website sometime and say \\"Hi\\" @ 'Judemac Forever\\".

B004IE0G58|5.0|With the release of Green Days' new live album \\"Awesome as F**k\\" - the California based band place another footstep in rock and roll history.  The album, which includes live songs collected from their 21st Century Breakdown World Tour, creates a fan-loved collection of songs spanning the bands 20 year career.    Having already released a live album, (2005s Bullet in a Bible) Green Day took a concisos step in not releasing the same set of songs again.  Awesomes`  set-list features the major radio singles you'd expect, along with gems from past releases.  Songs like Going to Pasalacqua and Who Wrote Holden Caulfield? are from indiependant releases, 39/Smooth and Kerplunk respectively.    A bonus to the hardcore fans comes in the form of the track Cigarettes & Valentines, a previously unreleased but highly sought after song.  Before the release of American Idiot, Green Day had been noted to have finished recording a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes & Valentines but before the release, they claim the master recordings were stolen and lost forever.  Instead of redoing the album, they wrote American Idiot and the rest was history. It was unknown to many if the album existed, or if it was a rouse for an alter ego band which rose during this time, The Network, a electronic pop/rock band that still claims to this day have no affiliation with Green Day. With the release of the new song, a nod to hardcore fans occurred - and the respect was shown again.    Now the sound of the CD is a fantastic mix on the energy of a live Green Day show.  Having seen them live myself, I can attest to the performance quality being only slightly enhanced for the audio disc.  Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong's intense vocal performance is shown through in crystal clear production, with the thrashing drums of Tre' Cool prominently thudding through the mix.    Nothing is lost in terms of quality.  At a live show it's sometimes hard to hear the band as a whole, and Awesome almost flawlessly balances out the energy of performance with the perfection of a studio album.  Green Day has always been a band to never give less than 100 percent to their fans.  Each show is unique and as powerful as the last.  A lot of bands do a special show for releases, and put on what some industry professionals say a \\"music video performance.\\" This certainly isn't the case with Green Day. Having taken songs from many stops on the tour, they prove that each show you attend will be as energetic and powerful as the last.    Included with the CD is a DVD (Or Blu-Ray) of a performance at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. The video is a fantastic visualization of the live show, providing you with great dynamic camera angles, and an immersion into the soul of a Green Day show.  Taking the set straight from the show, you don't miss a beat - and follow the energy wave from beginning to end.  All in crystal clear quality on top of it all. It's an icing on the cake after listening to the CD, and it is the second best thing to having been at the actual show yourself.    Awesome as F**k will forever stand out to me as one of the top live albums in music history. Not many bands can command an audience like Green Day, at the same time re-creating almost a studio performance of a song. With fan favorite tracklists, international locations and high definition audio and video, the album is a must for any Green Day fan. It is truly deserving of it's title.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I am also not going to rate the movie or it's genre: you are either a fan or you're not; you either get it or you don't.   My Blu-ray copy works perfectly, with none of the audio problems other reviewers note.  Is this movie dark? Yes, that's part of the message. If you have a Blu-ray player and a home theater system and like science fiction (even a little) you need to buy this movie, turn the lights off and turn the sound up.  Would I recommend this as a 'must-have movie'? No, but I would recommend it as a 'must-have Blu-ray' just to see what your home theater can do, especially if you can grab it for less than ten bucks.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|This is a great product. It fit my purpose great. I have great quality headphones but a computer can't maximise their sound. This took care of my problem. Good quality for what your paying.

B003TML0VO|2.0|This collection of rock guitar songs does feature some nice riffs by Carlos, but he repeats many of the phrases throughout the CD. What is really disappointing, is that all of the song arrangements fall flat compared to the original recordings. There seems to be no effort to make the arrangements unique or exciting. I would much rather listen to the original recordings then these boring knock offs. Some of the choices of songs are puzzling. For instance, \\"Dance The Night Away\\" by Van Halen. Surely, there's a better Van Halen guitar song than that. If you want to hear that fat, smooth Santana tone and a few hot riffs, you won't be disappointed. BUT, if you want to hear some good arrangements and new takes on some classic rock tunes, you won't find that on this collection of guitar riffs.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I love horses and I love Diane Lane.  Great picture, loved it from the opening credits to the roll of the final credits.  Nicely done, great acting, engaging story and wonderful story that needed to be told.  This is a Disney film all the way, no nasty or foul language, everyone keeps their clothes on and a moral to boot.  If you love horses, good stories or Diane Lane:)  Get this.  I live only 20 mins away from The Meadow, I remember the house and the fenced fields, the picture was very true on recreating that. Very nicely done, congrats to Disney and of course Diane Lane:)

B001K3JF7K|1.0|The Good - Nice album cover.  And that's where the \\"Good\\" ends  The Bad - Some how on this album I have noticed that DK's voice is too breathy for my taste (maybe not yours).  Sometimes it even gotten to the point of being too annoying to continue listening.  Much too overrated and hyped for audiophile auditioning.  She must have a great marketing team and a good promoter.  There are plenty of other modern/contemporary jazz/vocal artists out there to choose from.  I will not provide those names because I don't want this review to be taken as an advertisement for other female vocals.  But this CD was definitely a waste of my hard earned money.

I had purchased Makita tools exclusively for several years but eventually they were all replaced with other brands. I was curious to see what sort of performance this nailer would offer.<br /><br />The tool is fairly light and easy to hold. It performed well for the entire time it was used.  I feel it is appropriate for me to point out that I am a Mr. Fixit type handyman so my review is based on modest usage. On that basis the tool performed satisfactorily.

0399250573|5.0|**SPOILER WARNING~ENTER AT OWN RISK**    This book was absolutely epic, one of the best ones in the series! People say it was unoriginal, I disagree. It was different than the others because the mission was a fake and that made a good change. The only truly unoriginal part of it was the beginning. I have read that same beginning in countless fanfics and even written it myself. Jack's death was predictable. I've been waiting for her to die for quite a few books. She lived way too long. Smithers' secret was an absolute shock! I never guessed it until about a page before it happened! And Blunt......well, that just confirmed how evil he was!    I found one problem with the book though. Horowitz said in an interview that Alex's fate would be worse than death and he said in his blog that we would know, when we reached the end, that it would be the last Alex Rider book ever. But what happened to Alex wasn't really worse than death. Remember how Mr. Pleasure said Alex was healing? That doesn't signify worse than death. And us knowing it was the last Alex Rider book ever? I could see it going on. I could see the CIA knocking on his door and asking him to go on a mission. If Horowitz wanted to ensure Alex could never spy again, Alex should have gone insane or gotten brain damage or something that would make it so he couldn't function in society and certainly could not spy anymore. All of those are worse than death in my eyes.     Truth be told, it was kind of disappointing. I spent the last couple of months guessing what would happen to him in the end, what would happen that would be worse than death and how it would be impossible for him to spy again. I spent the day it came out literally screaming I needed that book and waiting for my dad to get home with the mail. I read it in about 3 hours, desperate to get to the end. And I was disappointed. All that waiting, all that guessing, all that worrying, and it just wasn't as good as it should have been. I expected something more. Something bigger. I actually dreamed about a week before Scorpia Rising came out that I read the book and the ending was disappointing. I told myself that could never happen  and look what happened! The ending was just as disappointing as it was in my dream.     So yer, epic book, but the end was sort of a disappointment. Read it anyway though! No really, do NOT let this review discourage you! The rest of the book was absolutely epic!
B001GCUNW6|5.0|This movie is super cute. This is the first movie that my daughter has actually watched all the way through and she loves it.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Although I am an Austen aficionado, I never could get into Emma, even though writings report it to be Austen's favorite of all her works. The meddlesome, interfering, immature Emma was more irritating than winsome, and I never could see what Mr. Knightley -- a sensible man -- saw in her.    This film version of the book, however, brings out what I didn't find in Austen's writing. Managing and ignorant (bad combination, that), Emma is still charming and fun, and I make allowances for her, as does the staid but sweet Mr. Knightley.    All of us, from the Norwegian Artist to the teenaged Son and Heir, enjoyed this movie, and we rushed to get our day's work done so that we could watch another installment.
0143113100|5.0|This was the most amazing book I've ever read!  I began reading the book aloud and it captivated my dad and grandma so much that I went out Christmas Eve morning and bought them each a copy for their stockings; I also bought a copy for my sister. The case studies are incredible testimonies of just how fascinating and awe-inspiring the human mind/brain area.  While the book includes a lot of technical medical explanations, the author brilliantly makes it understandable for any audience.  I have and will continue to recommend this book to any person who has the sense to recognize its significance!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is amazing simply put.  As for those reviews who state that it's hard on the knees, well you should LISTEN to what Jillian is saying during the video.  She gives tons of adjustments to you during the workouts if you have knee issues.  I was quite the sceptic at first wondering how a video could have these kind of claims but 1 month and 10 pounds later I am convinced.  The best thing is it only takes 20 minutes.  I don't do it every day beacuse I am currently training for some marathons so I run every other day.  Now when I started this routine I was not in shape, I have two small children and hadn't exercised in quite a few years so if I can do it you can do it!!!
0141324910|1.0|I ordered 2 books.... Diary of a Wimpy Kid (red cover) and Roderick Rules (blue cover). I NEVER received the Roderick Rules so I would rate it a zero and I would suggest EVERYONE take note of this before ordering.
1428156585|5.0|This book is awesome!    The story of Ayaan Hirsi Ali is fascinating, it starts with her childhood where she submerges you in a culture and a way of life that seems unconceivable for us to understand and yet a culture still very much alive these days with all it's horrors ( women circumcision , honor killings, arranged marriages, Blasphemy and Sharia Law, etc..). She takes you step by step through her own process of evolution when she, like most of indoctrinated children of any type of religion, becomes deeply devoted as a Muslim woman following every scripture in the Quran and even dressing with very thick suffocating black robe. But as time passes she feels the need of learning even more about the Quran and as she does she finds more questions than answers, more unfairness, injustices, etc and after a while her intelligence & inquiring mind takes over  and slowly she starts breaking free from irrationality and blind faith ( aren't ALL faith ..blind? ).     It is when her Father decides to marry her against her will and Ayaan has to  travel to be with her husband in another country that she decides to escape from her destiny and in the transit at an Airport in Germany she breaks free & goes to Holland to live staying with as a refugee. It is here that she makes the wonderful transformation ( like a butterfly) becoming  less and less scared, dependant, inferior, handicapped by her religious past & family clan ties and more & more self confident, educated, knowledgeable, financially independant.       So for me this is a book that should be read by anyone and everyone, it should be a book offered to children at the appropriate age of course, to read since it teaches so much about different contries, cultures, religions,politics. Also the beauty of freethinking and the horrors of the combination of fanaticism and religious/non religious dogmas (Communism/Socialism) like 9/11, the christian crusades and inquisition, North Korea and Hittler's Germany ( both Hittler andthe emperor of N.Korea equal to GODS & paradise exists as an euthopia)    I highly recommend this book as a must read!!
B0049OSQ18|3.0|I fell in love with \\"This is Why we Fight\\" from hearing it on the radio.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is quite different; very folksy and almost BlueGrass or something...  The lead singer has a great voice and the female vocal harmony is very good.  Not wild about all the harmonica, etc.
0756404738|3.0|...I can't give this book 4 stars.  I'm keeping the $30 first edition of it because it matches my first edition of The Name of the Wind and I have desperate hopes that the third (and possibly fourth or fifth) books will redeem this funky middle one.    I am an original Rothfuss fan.  I bought The Name of the Wind when it was in its FIRST HARDCOVER PRINTING and then proceeded to preach the Gospel of Rothfuss to everyone who would listen.  The book is really beautiful and subtle and brilliant.  I was thrilled at the thought of more of Kvothe's story in the Wise Man's Fear.    I can't tell you how painful it's been for me to admit to myself and to others that WMF was not worth the wait.  Even now, I just wince to write it here. I feel so loyal to the author and the overall story.  But it's just the truth.  I had to admit that:    ***HERE BE SPOILERS!***    1. Denna is still the most obnoxious character to ever walk the pages of English literature.    2. I don't like Kvothe as much now that I've read TWMF.  That could be part of the master plan.  After all, what 16 year old is really at his full character potential?  What 16 year old ISN'T an obnoxious prig?  I have hopes that he will improve.    3. But, the thing is, he SHOULD HAVE IMPROVED IN THIS 1000 PAGES.  Or at least learned something from his adventures.  Another reviewer pointed out perfectly that after spending months mastering his body language and emotional responses with Tempi's people, he still goes back to Imre with NO self-restraint.  However, he's still 16.  I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.    4. If Ambrose is the King he kills in the end to start the war (seeing as how Ambrose is 13th in line for the throne and 4 people in that line were killed during the course of the novel) I'll be desperately disappointed.  His scuffles with Ambrose, while life-threatening, are still so twee.  I was so annoyed that I was constantly reminded of Draco Malfoy in this book.  Never in the first one, but this one was painful.  Ambrose is the pet student of the teacher who hates Kvothe.  Ambrose is really rich.  Blah blah blah.  UGH!    5. This book has no arc. :(  There isn't a climax.  There isn't suspense.  There were a few exciting moments including the fight to clear the bandit encampment and then his moments with the Cthae.  Honestly, I don't even CARE that the Cthae is completely Deus Ex Machina at this point. I was just happy to LEARN SOMETHING NEW.  I actually felt a little thrill during those (way too few) pages where Kvothe learns those precious facts about the Chandrian.  And when he ran away in terror I wanted to scream \\"You PANSY!  Get back here so we can learn some more stuff!!! You're sure not learning it!\\"    6. I described this book to other people as 5 separate novels with a short story and a few interludes.  Not a good structure if you want to keep me engaged.     7.  Women are still kind of lame in this book.  Right?  They're all sex-crazed and serve to teach Kvothe how to add another superlative to his list.  \\"Over-Sexed-est 16 Year Old in All the Land.\\"  Devi and Fela work for me, but the fact that all the women put up with Kvothe's amazing amount of crap is rather disappointing.  And how nice that Kvothe was able to 'name' Felurian and subdue her.  Awesome.  The only woman with some kind of power (and of course, it's the sexy booby kind) gets subdued.  Just what I wanted.    8. The most heart-breaking thing about this read is that I don't care about Kvothe very much any more. Not just because he's turned into a Casanova and a moral-less dufus, but just because he hasn't changed at all in the ways that matter...in the ways that he might need to change for him to really be able to MEAN something down the line. And that is really a tragedy for me. :(    I will buy the third book because I have to have a matched set.  I'll even look forward to it because Pat really is a beautiful writer with a wickedly awesome sense of humor.  I just can't recommend the middle book to anyone, and that stings.

Dorian's reaction upon seeing the painting sets the story in motion:  \\"How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June...If it were only the other way! If it where I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that-for that-I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my own soul for that!\\"<br /><br />Lord Henry Wotton, or Harry to his friends, introduces young Dorian to Hedonism, convincing him through wit and satire to live out Harry's dreams by dedicating his life to pleasure.  What follows is an immensely entertaining, and extremely dark tale of the destruction of young Dorian Gray.<br /><br />The book, when released, was considered so scandalous, Wilde re-wrote sections and added 6 new chapters in order to appease the public.  Its publication contributed to his imprisonment for \\"gross indecency\\".  Wilde died in poverty within 10 years of its publication.<br /><br />This particular collection includes three additional short stories.
B004OBK4PW|4.0|It always cracks me up how terribly pastors are portrayed in films. Throwing fits, yelling at his wife etc. The wife does take some risks, but I don't think the impact of the news was dramatic enough on her life. She's the pastors wife you would think that would create a stir within the town. As for the scene. A reviewer mentioned that it is the longest kissing scene in film history, this is true, is it the hottest? Storyline and buildup wise maybe, but there have been several kisses in other films people will never stop talking about. The film overall isn't bad at all. If you aren't open about others sexuality than ofcourse don't watch it. If you just want to watch a movie about love, then sure, pick this one up.<br /><br />Sabrina Fuster makes her movie debut, does a great job I think and very pretty too.

0316286850|3.0|I was really excited to receive this book after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon. However, after reading it, I did not really feel that I had learned anything new. I have read countless magazines and online articles, and almost everything in the book can now be learned for free via the internet (blogs, websites, Youtube). The pictures are really nice and high-res, but I wish there were more details for specific makeup shades or brands. I'm glad that the book was pretty inexpensive, because I don't see myself referring to it that much in the future--in retrospect, I wish I had looked it over at the library or bookstore before buying it. The book would be most helpful for people who do not know much about makeup.

0316098337|5.0|This book was by far one of the most amazing pieces I have ever read. From cover to cover this book is entrancing.    I don't want to say too much so as not to spoil the story, but I will say that the world through the eyes of Jack is expressed so well I found myself thinking and speaking like the protagonist.     Also, friends of mine who haven't read a book since the year 2004 fell in love with Ma and Jack and the amazing story that unfurls.     I would love to see this as a play, however, I don't think given the explicit content as well as the extensive dialog, that a child could do such a demanding piece.     Jack is by far one of the most amazing characters of all time. He is so articulate and complex in the simplest of ways; he is a child.     I suggest this book to everyone.

B000002GWJ|5.0|Tom Waits said, in retrospect, that he'd felt guilty for singing, in his first two albums from the 70s (in a voice you'd barely recognize now) about happy subjects and love.  Listen to those albums anyway - he sounds great for feeling so uncomfortable.  Yet Blue Valentine, which was after those jazz records, has more in common with later Waits records without yet delving into his love of pots-and-pans clanging and sad circus trumpets - he instead hasn't left his jazz roots very far behind.  His voice had descended into hell, and his characters were wandering the streets in search of booze, drugs and johns.  It's clear these were the stories Waits was most comfortable telling, and he pleads for them, strikingly, by taking over a West Side Story song, \\"Somewhere,\\" at album's beginning, wrings its \\"somewhere there's a place for us\\" with Waits' three-weeks-into-a-bender growl, but does it without irony - it's actually quite beautiful.  In a way, that's really what, in retrospect, makes Blue Valentine so distinct from the other brilliant Waits albums of the 80s and 90s - it takes no effort to find its beauty.  \\"Red Shoes By The Drugstore\\" strikes me, almost like no other Waits song outside of the jazz-spoken word \\"Small Change,\\" as something that would read brilliantly as straight poetry: \\"She wore red shoes at the news stand/As the rain splashed the nickel/Spilled like chablis on the midway.\\"  \\"$29.00\\" charts desperation without losing any straight jazz appeal for 8 minutes.  \\"Kentucky Avenue\\" takes its sad-gutter sympathy to dramatic heights but never delves into maudlin exploitation.  Waits never made another album whose desperation sounded as sweet as it did on Blue Valentine, and by the time the album reaches its quiet title track at disc's end, you see why - the \\"Blue\\" matters as much as the \\"Valentine.\\"  Whatever you feel about Waits' songs later (and make no mistake, I've loved almost all of them), it's hard to think of another time when he reached out for the gutters with such unabashed compassion and love.tters with such unabashed compassion and love.
B000002UB2|3.0|An interesting, sometimes dark album of wonder and blues-pain emotions, beginning with a pathetic broken human creature of near-evil, a Hunch Back of Notre Dame Aqua Lung persona in Come Together and ending in a beer (wine) light-hearted drinking mockery of the Queen of England, probably a product of Lennon's then heroin addiction. He wrote/performed Cold Turkey soon thereafter (see YouTube video) about he and Yoko Ono's withdrawal. This is drug-induced discordant pleasure, the end of the road for the Beatles and their LSD marijuana-smoke trip. Lennon goes on to become a self-proclaimed atheistic guru of secular humanism after Abbey Road, rejecting his Beatles experiment in favor of an instant Karma pop humanistic Hinduism. The Beatles Long and Winding Road ends at Abbey Road, a fitting punctuation mark on less than a decade of some unforgettable music, as well as a not necessarily successful experimentation with drugs. (There are only 1295 reviews of Abbey Road, so why not one more!)<br /><br />We know the Beatles can produce some nice music that is universally acceptable, as are some of the songs here, some of which you will never forget once you have listened to them.<br /><br />The Beatles made drugs more acceptable and influenced a generation to experiment with marijuana and LSD. Ringo Starr did come out later and disavow abuse of drugs and drink, \\"Oh no no no I don't smoke it no more, I'm tired of waking up on the floor, no thank you please it only makes me sneeze, then it makes it hard to find the door.\\"<br /><br />This album was a childhood/ young teen favorite, although afterwards, I had second thoughts about the influence it had on my peer group towards drug experimentation.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my HTC Evo. I love the new graphics update, and the new concepts in the game. You are now saving captured birds instead of killing pigs. Also a large variety of new obstacles to contend with. If you like any of the others you will like this one.
0756404738|5.0|Finally!  I was eagerly anticipating the follow up to Name of the Wind and boy this does not disappoint.  Well you know what they say...perfection takes time.  This was a great, great read.  I could not put it down.  Patrick Rothfuss has such a beautiful way with words.  I found myself laughing out loud at times and other times I had tears rolling down my face.  The characters are beautifully rendered and you really feel for each one of them.  There are many OMG moments in this book and at times I found myself staying up to the wee hours of the morning before I could put it down.  This really is a great book and I cannot wait for Day 3.  Highly, Highly recommended!!!!!!  One of the best fantasy series ever written!

B000Q7ZO8U|3.0|I bought the Blu Ray edition b/c my 3 year old wore out the standard DVD edition. It got so used I could recite most of the lines in the movie, so I thought the Blu Ray edition might POP on my 1080P set. I really couldn't tell the difference really in video quality. The audio was equal also since I played both on my 7.1 sound system. My advice, stick with the standard DVD and save yourself some cash so you can buy something like Inception that will make your eyes pop and is a pleasure to listen to.    I gave it 3 stars because the movie storyline is quite excellent and my boys watch it year round. If the video or audio quality was better, it would have been a 4 star. Very few things in my book get a 5 star rating.
076781326X|5.0|According to Wikipedia, \\"Masterpiece (or chef d'aeuvre) in modern usage refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill or workmanship\\". Watching \\"Oliver!\\" I can't help thinking that this musical is a true masterpiece.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This one film makes an excellent starting point that shows the devastation to those who fell most completely (Iceland) for the careless deregulation that let too many \\"play\\" the system, then works back through those countries like Ireland that were slightly less devestated, before getting back to us.   There are hundreds of books by insiders that look at many fine details of how the problems arose and are continued.  I'd suggest Bethany McClean, Nomi Prins, and Yves Smith/Susan Webber, Greg Ip, John Bogle, Robert Reich, PBS's Paul Salmon, etc, to see a mix including the fine details and bigger pictures.  I actually don't like over regulation by static rules, or far too slow responses to dangerous trends.  Worst, to me, was the thoroughly corrupted rating agencies that called junk good, slapping triple A ratings (needed for our pension funds to be able to invest) on anything their clients wanted.  Simply fixing that would limit the ability to create hugely inflated debt instruments that fueled the foolishness.  (Don't hold your breath waiting for it, though.)     Beyond that, the video makes me think we need capable monitors that point out the quick adaptations the cleverest \\"players\\" make when those adaptations hurt overall productivity in favor of a quick buck.  Some handicapping is almost always needed to ensure a healthy sport (like horse racing), and economies that keep more people in the game.
1594488843|4.0|At the risk of sounding like a self-help zombie, I must say that I read this book at exactly the right time and found it extremely helpful. I was rummaging around trying to discover how to motivate my child in his schoolwork when I came across this book.<br /><br />Though the language is geared primarily toward workers and the workplace, it's easy to extrapolate the principles for students and schools. Intrinsic vs. extrinsic awards, when they work and when they don't. The surprising harm extrinsic rewards can do, when you're only trying to help! The three factors that enable success: autonomy, mastery and purpose. The value of targeted and earned praise and of \\"now that\\" rewards rather than \\"if-then\\" rewards. DIY report cards.<br /><br />I'm eager to put all this to work in our family. The downside is that we have no input into how our child's teachers teach, so we can only do so much. In the end, he'll most often just have to suck it up and do the work because he has to, not because he wants to. But that's a good life lesson, too.<br /><br />One thing that impeded my reading is the overabundance of labels and terms. They all jumbled together after a while: Motivation 2.0, Motivation 3.0, Type 1 vs. Type X. And don't get me started on \\"flow.\\" I gather it's a well-known sociological term that describes an optimal state of being, but it just doesn't resonate with me. A river flows, genius flows. The other term the author used for it, autotelic, was more descriptive, as far as I'm concerned. Instead of including a glossary, the book should have just used as many terms as were useful and understandable, no more. Labels and terms become a sort of shorthand that creates roadblocks for a reader.<br /><br />Also, fully a third of the book is not really written, but listed. It seems like the author just ran out of steam at the end and made the rest into backmatter. The recaps, summaries and study questions are pretty much a waste of space. But the first two thirds is good stuff.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|too much time spent setting up and trying to tweak this converter to work right.    This thing is the same old adapter they keep rehasing over and over with a different skin.  It still has the same problems with lag and glitches.  The biggest problem is the constant issues after each PS3 update patch that keeps killing this thing.  It is a paperweight now.    I would recommend the Fragfx Shark over this thing any day, at least the Shark does not need any updates and works after each PS3 patch.
0553582038|1.0|This rant is spoiler-free.     Last night, I finished the last 23 pages of A Feast for Crows, book 4 in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice in Fire series.  I said to my roommate Andrea, before going to bed, that I had 23 pages to go and that my friend Todd had mentioned one of the characters who he had hated in the beginning of the series actually becoming interesting later on in the series.  I shook the book at Andrea and cried, \\"WHEN?!\\"  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if you can barely remain awake during the last 23 pages of book 4 of a supposedly great series, maybe it's not such a great series.  I really, really disliked book 1, A Game of Thrones.  But, Andrea had read it and loved it.  Todd had read it and loved it.  Seemingly everyone in the world read it and loved it.  So, I thought there must be something wrong with me.  I just wasn't getting what was so great.  Perhaps I hadn't really applied myself.  I spoke to my friend Scott S., who said that he has tried to read the first book three or four times and could not get through it (HOORAY, I'm not alone!).  He said that a coworker of his read the series and loved it, but claimed that book 2, A Clash of Kings, is where things really get going.  WRONG.  WRONG WRONG WRONG.  And while I will agree that book 4 is the weakest of the series, it's just more of the same s***, only with less interesting characters!  Books 1-4 focus on eleventy-billion characters.  Every chapter you switch characters.  So, you spend roughly 20-30 pages with a character and then hundreds of pages later, you return to that character.  Sometimes, a minor character is introduced in that one chapter that you read several hundred pages ago.  When you return to the main person in that chapter, you're goddamned lucky if you remember who the minor character was who was introduced way back when.  You're already juggling so many characters, so many plotlines, you just can't retain anything else.  And then, with so many of the characters, instead of any real action happening, you just end up trudging through repeats of the same old boring internal monologue that he or she has been having since FOREVER.  And then, as a reward for reading that boring s*** over and over, they get killed, having accomplished jack s***.  Thank you, Mr. Martin!  I don't even understand how anyone gets attached to characters in this series because you don't get to spend any time with them and then when you do, it's more of the same boring s***.    Last night, when I managed to finish the last 23 pages, I got to George R. R. Martin's cute little p.s.  I have replaced character names with \\"X\\" because some of you are still trudging through the series and I'd hate to spoil it for you by letting you know someone has not yet been killed.  The editor notes are mine.    \\"`Hey, wait a minute!' some of you may be saying about now.  `Wait a minute, wait a minute!  Where's X and the X?  Where's X?  We hardly saw X.  That can't be all of it...'    Well, no.  There's more to come.  Another book as big as this one.  [ed. What a shock!]    I did not forget to write about the other characters.  Far from it.  I wrote lots about them.  Pages and pages and pages.  Chapters and more chapters.  I was still writing when it dawned on me that the book had become too big to publish in a single volume... and I wasn't close to finished yet.  To tell all of the story that I wanted to tell, I was going to have to cut the book in two.    The simplest way to do that would have been to take what I had, chop it in half around the middle, and end with `To Be Continued.'  The more I thought about that, however, the more I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters rather than half the story for all the characters.  So that's the route I chose to take.  [ed. What the hell is he talking about?  This entire series is one endless To Be Continued!  The only resolution you ever get is when someone f***ing dies!  And were the readers really better served by a book focusing almost exclusively on the most boring and/or loathsome characters?  Not that it made much difference to me, since I found the other 3 books boring and endless, too.  As I mentioned previously, this one just had the added bonus of less interesting characters.  Hooray!]    X, X, X, X and X, X, and all the rest of the characters you love or love to hate will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons, which will focus on events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present book focused on King's Landing.\\"    - George R. R. Martin, June 2005    That's right.  He wrote that afterward in June of TWO THOUSAND FIVE.  He predicted a release date of 2006.  Guess when A Dance with Dragons came out?  That's right, never!  Martin recently confirmed a July 2011 release date.  And he's STILL writing the goddamned thing.    At some point when I was wading through this series, Andrea said she thought book 4 was the last book and I showed her that A Dance with Dragons was still to come.  Then, in commentary on my friend Jason B's FB conversation about the release date, I said, \\"Is book 5 supposed to be the last one?  Because if that's what he says, I DON'T BELIEVE HIM!\\"  A friend of Jason's said, \\"The 6th one is supposed to be the last.\\"  Yah, right.  Then I read that there are supposed to be SEVEN.  SEVEN!  SEVEN endless books!  Jason said last night that maybe Martin was \\"building up to something supremely awesome.\\"  And I said, \\"I'm sorry, but if it takes you 6 books (and I still don't believe that will be the end, nor that he will ever actually complete the series) to build up to something supremely awesome, you're doing it wrong.\\"    George R. R. Martin wrote a beautiful novella called A Song for Lya.  It won the Hugo for Best Novella in 1975.  I am having trouble reconciling that Martin, the one who could tell a powerful story in a short span of time, with this Martin, who can't seem to finish a story EVER, let alone make me actually care about the characters or what's happening.  I have been tempted to go back and read A Song for Lya again, but I'm afraid that my current feelings for Martin will completely ruin the A Song for Lya experience.    My friend Scott S. mentioned some other series whose universe was supposed to be richly realized.  Scott said something along these lines:  it couldn't help but be a richly realized universe because the author described every goddamned cobblestone in every street.    Everyone keeps saying how masterful the Martin series is and, in my opinion, the only masterful stroke is Martin's inexplicable ability to keep a**holes reading it.  Even a**holes like me, who hate the whole goddamned series.  There were probably at least 400 times where I would stop reading mid-sentence, take a deep breath and think, \\"F*** this.  I DON'T GIVE A S***.\\"  And I didn't.  I truly didn't care what happened to anyone.  And then, inexplicably, I would keep reading.  After a certain point, it became this masochistic challenge.  I didn't want this series to defeat me.  I WANTED to understand the allure.  But, nearly 4000 pages later, I failed.  And after my mini-rant last night, and after finishing book 4, I was so tired, so broken, my soul so completely crushed, I couldn't bear to write about it this morning.  As you can see, I got over it.  However, I am DONE with this f***ing series.  Lucky for me, Martin isn't even done writing book 5 and even if I WANTED to read book 5, I wouldn't remember most of the characters by the time it came out and there is no way in hell I would ever go back and read books 1-4 again to refresh my memory.    I want to punch George R. R. Martin in the face.  And then I want to punch myself in the face for sticking with this goddamned series for so long.    Final thought:  Just because it's epic doesn't mean it's good.

But I still find myself picking this book up and reading it all the time. It's not for beginners, but the way it is written makes it easy to follow. You can just have a basic dictionary with you for vocabulary words and you're good to go! The stories about the little schoolboy Nicolas and his classmates are so cute, and the illustrations go perfectly with them. Any French fanatic should have this in their library!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I am an avid Batman fan, I own every movie (animated and live) the 90s Cartoon, Batman Beyond etc and I have to say, Under the Red Hood is by far the best Batman movie ever made. The first thing that struck me was how good the animation was. (Mask of the Phantasm was an amazing movie but animation was found lacking) this one is well animated, deftly scored and voiced. True with DiMaggio (bender) rather than Mark Hamill as the Joker, it sounds a little off but after a while you get used to it. Under the Red Hood is a dark and brutal masterpiece of DC Animation and oh my gosh... it is beautiful just BEAUTIFUL to watch. I have watched it 10 times easily already and have not gotten tired of it. this is how batman should always be portrayed. HEAR THAT BURTON, SCHUMACHER, AND NOLAN, take notes.. the animated team got it right again, they started with Mask of the Phantasm, continued with the Mr. Freeze Subzero film and now topped even the great Nolan himself with Under the Red Hood. DC Animation knows how to make their films right.
0393972844|5.0|Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her.  I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself.  I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book.  I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read.  The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is.  She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us.  She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters.  Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.    This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular.  I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent.

0767020308|5.0|I have just recently finished reading Emma by Jane Austen and I was looking forward to watching this rendition of the book.  I have seen the Gwyneth Paltrow version before and I was not impressed with it but now that I have read the book I will probably watch it again and see if I still feel the same way about it.  This version of Emma stars Kate Beckinsale our Emma and I felt like she was the perfect.  I had pictured Emma to be similar to how Kate Beckinsale portrayed her and I was very impressed with how Kate Beckinsale managed to convey how clever Emma was without making her seem too silly. I admit that I had some doubts about Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley, considering he always plays the bad guy, but I found that I was pleasantly surprised by how well he pulled this part off.  I found by the end of the movie that I could not have imagined the role being played by anyone else.  Raymond Coulthard is also excellent as our handsome Mr. Frank Churchill.  I also enjoyed the screenplay, I thought that it stayed true to the book even though there was some inconsistencies I still felt like they did not take away from the plot.

B0044E9LW6|4.0|It's been close to a year since the iconic, majestic, soaring and commanding voice that was the beacon for all things Heavy Metal departed this earthly realm to exist forevermore amongst the magical rainbows of which he so often sang. When Ronnie James Dio succumbed to the most-dreaded of earthly disease last May, it seemed so unfair -and impossible really- that the Man on The Silver Mountain could be taken from us in such an inconceivable manner.     Although the man and the legend may be gone, his legacy lives forever through his astonishing musical catalog - as formidable and revered a catalog if ever there was one.     From his legendary stint fronting Ritchie Blackmore's RAINBOW in the 1970's, to his match-made-in-heaven collaborations with BLACK SABBATH in the early-80's, straight through to the outfit with proudly bore his name, Ronnie James Dio personified Heavy Metal. Dio was the real deal: a sweet, genuine man who was extremely passionate about the music he crafted and the fans for which he performed.      We can now add another chapter to the DIO saga with the posthumous release of DIO AT DONINGTON UK: LIVE 1983 & 1987, a barnstorming 2-disc set (released under the auspices of NIJI Entertainment) which captures the DIO band at the height of their powers showcasing two blistering live shows at the legendary MONSTERS OF ROCK Festival at Castle Donington.    Disc One features DIO performing at the 1983 version of the WHITESNAKE-headlined festival and shows them a band afire; plowing through selections from the debut DIO-LP HOLY DIVER (which had just been released through Warner Bros). The classic, throw-your-fists-into-the-air rave-up that is \\"Stand Up And Shout\\" kicks proceedings off in the requisite steamroller manner and captures DIO firing on all-cylinders. Axe-pert Vivian Campbell (ex- SWEET SAVAGE, current DEF LEPPARD) lays waste to the Donington faithful closest the stage and leans into the buzzsaw riff of 'Shout' at maximum speed and never looks back. What follows is an incendiary-set which encompasses selections from the aforementioned debut as well as select tracks from DIO's colorful and illustrious past. Gems such as \\"Man On The Silver Mountain,\\" an abbreviated \\"Stargazer\\" and \\"Children Of The Sea\\" are performed with biting vigor and fiery enthusiasm and stand proud alongside newer fare such as \\"Rainbow In The Dark\\" and \\"Straight Through The Heart.\\" A stunning set and one that I'm sure left the acts that had yet to perform that day shivering in their spandex.      Disc Two focuses on DIO's triumphant return to Donington at the 1987 Bon Jovi-headlined MONSTERS festival. Touring in support of the then newly-released DREAM EVIL LP, this particular incarnation of the DIO band featured guitarist Craig Goldy (ex-ROUGH CUTT/GIUFFRIA) on lead duties. DIO '87 features a more varied-set list and also includes selections from his various pre-DIO outfits as well as the ever-growing DIO stand-alone catalog. The gargantuan \\"Last In Line\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Children\\" from 1985's SACRED HEART album are unveiled here and take the Castle by force.  Guitarist Goldy really comes into his own on this stage and his playing -especially during a particularly heavy version of \\"Neon Knights\\" - is superlative. Throughout both set's, Dio's vocals are in fine form; serene and heavenly one moment and positively SEISMIC and seemingly capable of cracking the sky through sheer will the next.         Although DIO's voice has sadly been silenced, this live document of his band ROARING through some of the all-time classics in the history of Heavy Metal is a searing testament to Ronnie James Dio's contributions to the music and lifestyle we so adore. - Ronnie Jimenez
B004BSEKH6|5.0|The best female hip-hop artist to date. Nicki takes you through the highs and lows of emotion in this album. She does an awesome job. Love this CD - one of the few CD's I can put on from track one to the end and not have to skip any.    Get Em. YMCMB!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have 40mb or more available in my phone and this dumb thing tells me I don't have room for ag Rio. I was kind of hyped about it too. thanks for letting me down amazon. wouldn't be the first time you effed me. uninstalling amazon app store now.
0765322889|4.0|This is the first book in a series that replaced Song of Ice and Fire as my favorite fantasy series.  It is full of original aspects, but could be compared to Glenn Cook's \\"Black Company,\\" except much more fully realized, satisfying and better executed.    Book 1, Gardens of the Moon, is not likely to be the best book you have ever read.  It is good, but merely an introduction to the greater whole, which for me, is the most reliable reading experience I have had to date.  Erikson delivers.
B004A8ZWT2|4.0|I'm not a fan of big and long drawn out reviews so I'll just get to the point. I don't know why everyone is hating on this film so much but I actually enjoyed it. True, the plot wasn't the most amazing thing ever, but it was funny and lighthearted and didn't take itself too seriously. The twist at the end and Elise's line about his face when they're sailing away in the boat was classic, haha. Definitely a good buy and I don't regret it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|this is another great AB product. it plays very well on the XOOM and adds some nice twists to an already awesome game play. hats off to Rovio.

1593272774|5.0|This excellent illustrated \\"Idea Book\\" will serve: 1. Lego builders and enthusiasts, 2. Mindstorms NXT Roboticists, 3. Makers and DIY'ers seeking a basic knowledge of mechanisms, 4. Students and Teachers seeking a hands on introduction to Simple Machines Physics/Engineering.<br /><br />I was at first distressed by the lack of accompanying text and disassembled component illustrations--that is until I saw the brilliance of the illustration scheme.  The choice of views illustrated along with the coloring of the models allows both easy reproduction of the models and visualization of other Simple Machine and Mechanism-based ideas.  I would call attention to the note on economically acquiring<br />the components of these models in another review by a member of No-Starch Press's staff (the publisher of this Idea Book).<br /><br />As a member of the local Philly Hackerspace (Hive 76) I am particularly impressed with how this illustrated Idea Book could serve to acquaint those interested in acquiring a basic knowledge of Mechatronics and Mechanisms for work in Robotics and 3D Prototyping (Reprap and Makerbot).<br /><br />I believe this simple illustrated Idea Book will serve students and all interested in learning a bit of the Mechanical World.<br /><br />--Ira Laefsky, MS Engineering/MBA

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I am disappointed in this book. I downloaded it on my kindle and was anticipating a delicious read of witches and other worldly creatures.   The book starts off good enough about a witch who has the ability to break a spell on a manuscript that delves into the origins of creatures.... she falls in love with a vampire and they are attacked by other creatures and that's pretty much where I start disliking this book. First off, the main character is supposed to portray this rock solid, hard core female who can take care of herself, needs no man to protect her, is resilient and so on..... oooooooofff course, it don't work out that way. She is this overly fragile thing, always on the verge of passing out or is weak because she had to use her craft or because she walked up a flight of stairs, etc. Her character is really starting to get on my nerves. The main vampire dude is an Edward Cullen wannabe. Gawd! So, annoying. I wish the author could have stayed focused on the manuscript and the intrigue into the origins of the creatures. She totally disappointed me with this book. I will read it finished just because I don't like to leave it unread, but geesh! I am disappointed that I bought the download.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I Love Action and I Love Comedy and to have a film that is both Action and Comedy is even better ! And this movie didn't fail to deliver on either the action or the Comedy (though there was more action than comedy).<br /><br />Frank (Bruce Willies) is a retired secret agent, he just met this girl Sara through the phone and he's living happily. However, things quickly change when a group of assassinates attack his house at midnight in order to get him killed. Now Frank Have No Idea who wants him dead, he's no longer working and won't make a threat to anybody but obviously someone wants him killed. When investigating further Frank discovers that the killers are not only targeting him, there's a list of names (with his name included) and almost everyone on that list is either killed or is going to get killed and the funny thing is almost every one of them is retired and old. Who wants them dead ? And most importantly why ? After searching further Frank discovered that all the names on that list had something in common they all were...well I'm not gonna tell you. You have to watch the film and find out for yourself !<br /><br />I liked the shooting scene in the cargo, it was funny ! I also liked the scene at the end it was pretty cool. The acting was great ! I love almost all of the actors in this film. I really liked Helen Mirren she was fantastic as always ! My only Complaint is that Morgan Freeman never had enough screen time. The love stories were sweet too, especially the old couple :) and some of the jokes were actually funny even though I'm a person who laughs at actions more than words.<br /><br />So if you want to see a group of retired secret agents who can still kick some a$$ in a non-corny way then I recommend you watch this, true some of the action is over the top and unbelievable but it was intended to be funny.
0897241649|1.0|The notation should have matched the chords as played in first position with the understanding that the guitar would have a capo on a higher fret.  That is the strength of the guitar, to change keys so easily by moving the capo.  Notating the exact tones is useless and frustrating even though I read classical guitar music.  What a dumb idea.  Don't bother with this book.  Geesh.  What a dumb idea.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|This is a great movie. It had it all...action, suspense, romanance, and even sentimental moments.  I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. I recommend it as a must see!!!
1591843790|5.0|First a confession, I'm a Guy Kawasaki book junkie. It's true, I think I have them all. But, not because Guy is a superstar Valley dude, though he is one for sure, not because I drank the apple Kool-Aid years ago, though I mostly have, but because when I read Guys' books they inspire me to take action, MASSIVE ACTION. In fact, I've created my last three startups on the heels of reading one of Guy's books. There is just something about how Guy puts that dreamy 50,000 foot I'm unstoppable feeling into my head combined with a brass knuckle tactile get it done today ambition that makes his books always pay off, every time. Period.<br /><br />Guy's latest book Enchantment is no different. I'm about 50% through the book, and yes, I've been thinking about yet another startup idea and he has me riveted to both the page and an intense desire to jump out of my seat and get the avalanche of ideas out of my head and into those first action steps.<br /><br />I'm also a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books, especially [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]], got your 10,000 hours in yet? If not, get to it! Gladwell taught me about the idea of tipping. Go cause your idea to tip, that's the path. Gladwell is a brilliant data filled academic and a great writer. But, what Kawasaki adds to the mix is the fact that he's a business person who happens to read and write in a very detailed actionable way. Malcolm Gladwell will tell you what you need to do: Tip. But Guy Kawasaki will tell you how to do what you specifically need to do in the form of an action list. It's clear, read the page and now go get it done.<br /><br />If you do nothing but buy Enchantment and read Chapter 6 on How To Overcome Resistance, you'll hit it out of the park. Pay specific attention to his ideas around social proof, this is killer stuff that works.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Haunting, melodic this album sends chills down my spine when I listen to it. Adele doesn't have the vocal range of Leonia Lewis but she is a consummate artist and musician. A throwback artist that may not appeal to Rap aficionados that may find her work boring but for older listeners and younger old school fans she will be deeply appreciated. Her lyrics and talent are glowing, the girl is strong, forget Winehouse, Joss Stone, Leonia Lewis this is Englands luminary.

B0045HCIZY|5.0|I have a confession to make, I am a romantic not just a bit but a LOT. I can get carried away, especially with Love stories but Hollywood nowadays, not talking about the 80s or the 90s from (2000-20_) on started getting really clich&eacute;d especially when it comes to Romance movies. I don't usually watch Romance films because there isn't enough airing at the movie theater, I mean when was the last time you saw a \\"truly romance\\" film getting so hyped up ? \\"Twilight\\" doesn't count, nor does Romance Comedies. I think the last Romance film everyone was crazy about was probably \\"Titanic\\". So, anyway this movie \\"Before Sunrise\\" is a sweet/romantic story. There is no bad guys wanting to hurt anybody, there is no ex husbands or forbidden loves, there is no \\"danger\\" of any kind, no druggies, alcoholic or single working moms living in agony and depress or abusive husbands yada yada. Just a darn good movie, plain and simple.<br /><br />I'm not going to review the plot, since a lot of reviews has done that I'm sure. I'm just gonna say what I liked about this movie, in case you want or planning on seeing it.<br /><br />First of all, I really liked the scenery (for those who don't know) this movie takes place in Vienna, Austria and you get a very good view of the city, you know resturants, cafes, parks, the river, sight seeings that kind of stuff. I'm a travel freak, I really love to travel, see new places I've never traveled on a train but I want to and I always had a thing for Europe, I don't why maybe because I plan to live there someday so seeing all these shots of a European themed city was very cool ! I also liked the idea how in the end of the film they just kinda show us all the places the two characters went to, they say a photo can say a thousand words and I felt those quick recaps of the views really said a lot.<br /><br />Second of all, I really liked the characters Jesse and Celine. They were both likable and sweet. They also played perfectly together, I never felt like I was watching a movie rather like hearing someone's story. But Most importantly I think what made them charming for me is because they are \\"Ordinary\\" people, they are the kind that you can feel related to, the kind that you meet everyday. Like No supernatural powers or vampires or anything from that sort, just two very normal, very human people. I think most people can see themselves in Jesse or Celine.<br /><br />Most of all, I liked how this movie was romantic but the romance wasn't trying to overdo itself. I mean think about it, most romance movies there is dancing in the rain and things like that. Well, this movie wasn't from that sort, It felt real. I felt like I can relate to the story, I really felt like you know someone out there can be in a train traveling somewhere and meet someone, they start talking and spend some time together and really feel like they had a good time just being their selves. I felt like this could happen to anyone, even to me I can feel the same way about someone I meet one day. In other movies, when the hero/heroine have their first kiss it just feel so natural and so rehearsed, but when Jesse and Celine had their \\"first\\" kiss I really felt like it was their \\"first\\" I mean it felt so awkward.<br /><br />I would say this isn't your typical Hollywood romance movie or at least not the popular once. It isn't packed with sex and \\"I Love You so much\\" and \\"I never wanna let you go\\" kinda movie. It's mostly talk, just two people talking and sharing their thoughts about the world. It's mostly dialog, there isn't a \\"save the day\\" situation or anything like that. So, if your into talking, if you believe that someday you'll find that special someone or if you have just a little bit romantic in you. Give this movie a chance, I liked it but it really depends on your taste. If however, you feel like this kind of movies where two people talking, getting to know each other is boring and lame then I would advise against watching it but it neverhurts if you gave it a chance...who knows ? you might like it.<br /><br />OK, now for all of you who'll get to end of the movie and think......??? Well, don't be so disappointed because there is a sequel to this movie called \\"Before Sunset\\" and it takes place nine years after the first. So if you watched the first and loved it, you can always watch the sequel :)? you might like it.    OK, now for all of you who'll get to end of the movie and think......??? Well, don't be so disappointed because there is a sequel to this movie called \\"Before Sunset\\" and it takes place nine years after the first.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I put off reading this prize-winning novel for some months because I feared it might sensationalize its subject matter. It doesn't. I am glad I finally read it; the five-year-old's point of view alone is an incredible novelistic accomplishment. A tour de force, not to be missed.
0545123275|5.0|This book was incredible, from start to finish. I've tried writing a review for this about 3 times already, but continue erasing it because I can't seem to describe how amazing I think this book is. I absolutely loved it and was SAD that it ended. Happy because of the ending, but genuinly sad, because I wanted more. Buy this book. Buy it because you will NOT regret it.
B001AQT0OU|5.0|Kubrick at the peak of his powers and using all the tools of his craft to exquisite effect.  The film immerses the viewer in the period and into the lives of the characters much like a great novel.  One of a handful of films that not only nourishes the viewer but is supremely entertaining. The style and pace of the film are reflective of the style and art of the period.  Violence and lust boiling beneath a manicured facade of dress and manner.   A gem.   The rating is based on the film itself from previous viewings.  Let's hope the blu-ray does it justice.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|anyone who is a fan of the original angry birds will love this latest adventure. graphics, presentation, sound, and concept are more polished than the highly successful original. nice job, rovio.
