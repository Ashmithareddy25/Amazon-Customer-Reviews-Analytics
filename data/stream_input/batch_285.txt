B00006RU5B|4.0|The pairing of Chris Cornell and members of Rage Against The Machine could be the dream team of rock. Once they made their intentions of joining forces known to the world, Pavlovs' perverbial rock dogs got to salivating. This record has an intensity that has been missing from the music scene since Soundgarden split up. The music alone would be enough to draw you in, but once you start exploring the lyrics you find where the real meat of the songs are. If you have been looking for real rock, look no further, Audioslave has the real rock.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The film Gettysburg, fully captures the experience of war as our generation has never been able to comprehend. For four years, men from both the north and the south fought for their respective causes; some to protect individual states rights, and others to maintain a perfect union. They knew nothing of laser guided bombs or missles fired on victims whos faces are invisible to us. They did know musket guns, small round lead balls used as bullets, a gun powder pouch, and a block of chewing tobacco to pass the time. They wore heavy uniforms, and marched hundreds of miles in 95 degree heat. When you watch this film, you will know how these brave men lived, and died in battle. You will know how it feels when a bullet pierces your shoulder when fired on from only 10-100 feet away; You will feel the cannons explode; You will smell the smoke of hundreds of rifles firing simultaniously, and you will know how it feels to see men on either side of you falling in battle. You will experience the emotinal and physical struggle just to make it through one more hour of life.<br />More importantly, you will learn from dialogue between officers and soldiers what they were thinking, and why they did what they did. Some call this a waste, but they are only looking for action, and ignoring the how and why of a soldiers commitment in fighting these battles. These men did not fight for money or power; they fought for a cause, and did so with great pride and dignity. Listen to the open hearts of brother fighting against brother; Of comrads in battles before the civil war now on opposite sides under opposing flags. Learn what went through the commanders mind when planning a battle with only the wisdom of scouts hiding in the fields to assist him. To those who dont like the dialogue, watch the film on your VCR, because most of it is edited out, along with many detailed scenes of the battles. <br />To fully appreciate the authenticity of this film, you have to walk a little farther than to the remote control of your television set; You have to go to the battlefield, and walk in those fields where so many lost their lives. Walk in solitude, and listen for the ghosts of the past to speak to you. Listen for the fife and drum play as they marched, and readied for battle. Walk in the wheatfield, and look down to see if any of the blood is still there. Go to the road behind the wheatfield, and listen for the union soldiers as they ready themselves to run across the field, only to get slaughtered by the confederates on the other side. They say that so many died there, you could not walk across it without slipping on the blood. Go to big round top, and see why both armies wanted it so dearly. There is where you will see and feel what the battle of gettysburg was all about.<br />Then go to the national cemetery, and look down at all the people who died defending our union. There are no southerners buried there. They were carried back to their homes. Read Lincolns gettysburg address, and fully comprehend what was in his heart. He truly wanted the war to end then and there, having no stomach for another year of war. Then go watch the film again, and really understand it.
0064407667|4.0|I read this book, initially, because of the frequent comparisons I heard drawn between it and the Harry Potter series, which I love. While this was an interesting book, I don't quite understand the comparison -- it's like comparing \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"  They are entirely different realms of fiction. While the Potter books are generally hopeful, this goes for a more bleak tone. There's no magic or element of fantasy in this book either, it's just an unusual little tale that isn't bad, but leaves one wondering.<br />The author frequently warns the audience that the story of the Baudelaire orphans is an unhappy one, which it is, but at the end of the book it doesn't seem quite as hopeless as the tone would lead you to believe. These are bright, resourceful children who have been tragically orphaned and taken in by a cruel, scheming relative (never seen that in fiction before, have we?), but they are SO bright and SO resourceful that by the time the book ends you are confident that no matter what \\"unfortunate event\\" happens next they will find a way to make it through.<br />The author writes in an almost conversational style, as though the reader is in a circle of children crowded around him. He even takes this to the extreme of defining words for you, which is cute the first few times, but as a device is enormously overused. Plus, it betrays the true intended audience of the book. If you're writing for an audience that doesn't know what \\"fitfully\\" means, you won't write, \\"fitfully,\\" you'll write \\"restlessly.\\" And don't even get me started on \\"adroit.\\"<br />The children are likeable, though, and you find yourself feeling sorry for them. Sorry enough, at least, to consider reading book two. I suspect that also has an ending that leaves you sympathetic enough to march on towards part the third, and so on.<br />It's a clever book, but not quite as clever as it thinks it is, and it's clearly not a book everyone will enjoy. But I think many people will.<br />Oh -- and one personal gripe. It's a \\"rough cut\\" book, meaning the edges of the pages are ragged and don't line up with one another. I suppose this is done for effect, but I HATE \\"rough cut\\" books. Just thought I'd throw that in there.will.<br />Oh -- and one personal gripe.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Director Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind from 2001 is based on the real life story of Professor John Nash.  Dr. Nash was a budding mathematical genius who attended Princeton University, taught at MIT but suffered from schizophrenia.  He sank to the bottom, only to rise again and win the Nobel Prize in 1994.  The film carries us along Nash's journey and Mr. Howard applies some real surprises.  The viewer doesn't know that Nash's roommate Charles, his niece Marcee, the Department of Defense agent, Parcher, and the mission to decode magazines that he gives to Nash are not real, but delusions that are the result of Nash's affliction.  In the meantime, Nash falls in love with and marries the beautiful Alicia with whom he starts a family.  Alicia is stunned to find out about his affliction and her support and love is tested and tried throughout the film.  Russell Crowe brilliantly plays Nash, but Jennifer Connelly as Alicia is every bit his equal and then some.  Ms. Connelly is the glue that holds the film together and she deservedly won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  Mr. Howard finally won a coveted Best Director Oscar and the film took home two other Awards including Best Picture.
B0000797IO|3.0|...P>A movie with a moral. Don't be a thief and don't be disturbed.<br />Oh and for the record this is not an \\"indie\\" film, it's a low budget film that was released by 20th Century Fox. Big difference.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a brilliant epic based on a revolt by Scots against England in medieval times.  Mel Gibson directs and stars as William Wallace, the leader of the revolt.  Mr. Gibson is no stranger to action movies, but Braveheart is so much more than just your standard action film.  It is grand in scope and despite its considerable length, it never drags.  The battle scenes in this film are monumental.  Intricately detailed and mesmerizingly real, you feel as if you are transported into a medieval battle.  The film is quite gory and bloody, but not gratuitously so.  Mr. Gibson strays away from his usual charming character to play Wallace as a man does not seek glory, but leads the revolt because he knows it is his duty to do as such.  Patrick McGoohan portrays King Edward I, known as Longshanks, with an icy evil that makes him a compelling villain.  The film was a critical and commercial success and it wracked up ten Academy Award nominations in 1995, winning five including two for Mr. Gibson who won for Best Picture (he was one of the producers) and one for Best Director.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that connects with the longings in your soul. A.I. is such a movie. Like some other reviewers here, I was sworn off this movie by friends who had seen it before me and hated it. That aroused my curiosity enough to see it for myself.<BR>It blew me away. It succeeded in pleasing me on so many levels: the story of a boy's longing to be loved, his epic adventures, the questions about life - real and artificial, the casting and excellent acting, and the thrilling special effects.<BR>I can't believe the vindictiveness against Steven Spielberg I have seen among these reviews. What's your problem, people?! He truly is a master storyteller of the visual medium. So many of his films have become beloved classics, even when the Academy snobs have ignored his work, as with the magnificent Amistad.<BR>At the time of A.I.'s release, professional film critics seemed to dwell on the collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick in the making of this movie, as though that defined the film. They said Spielberg's optimism and lighter tone was tempered by Kubrick's cynicism, or the other way around. Granted, I imagine Spielberg honored the late Kubrick's vision, but he himself has not shied away from presenting the world in its ugliness, as with the heart-wrenching Schindler's List.<BR>Other than musings about Kubrick and Spielberg's genius, and the long-time sci-fi love affair with robots that think and feel, A.I. offers us other lessons to consider: the treatment of children as possessions to adore or discard as we see fit (the robot David represents all unwanted children); and the longing all of us have to be whole and to be loved.<BR>William Hurt's character brings up the question of God at the beginning of the film. He responds to a question about the ethics of creating robots that feel emotion by recalling Genesis: &quot;Why did God create Adam?&quot; he asks. Answering his own question, he says, &quot;To love him,&quot; meaning the love God expected from Adam, and by extension the rationale for creating robots that love us. That's only half-true. God also created Adam because God wanted to love Adam. As selfish humans, David's creator and David's sometime mother failed to return the love they expected from David.<BR>Don't look for a typical sappy happy ending here. This film is more Grimm's Fairy Tales than Disney. It's closer to the original Hans Christian Anderson Little Mermaid than the Disney version. It expresses longings that we know will not be fulfilled in this life.
B00003CXCW|4.0|Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a dark comedy about the decline of stardom and the inability of a vainglorious actress to realize that her star has faded and she has become a has-been.  Gloria Swanson stars as Norma Desmond who was once a huge star in the silent film era, but was quickly forgotten once talkies took over.  William Holden is Joe Gilles who is a failed screenwriter who stumbles upon Norma's crumbling mansion on Sunset Blvd while trying lose some repo men who are after him.  Joe discovers that Norma is attempting a comeback with a screenplay she has written based on Salome.  Joe sees a chance at a hit and he starts rewriting the screenplay for his own purposes as he becomes Norma's lover.  Norma becomes more and more demented as the film progresses and eventually goes completely over the edge at the end of the film.  The film is told as a flashback by Mr. Holden's character and one of the more inventive aspects of the film is that Mr. Holden's character is dead and is recounting the story from beyond the grave.  Sunset Boulevard is one of the most revered films in movie history, but actually only won three Academy awards in 1950 despite being nominated for eleven with most notable of three being for Best Writing, Story &amp; Screenplay in which Mr. Wilder shared it with co-authors Charles Brackett &amp; D.M. Marshman, Jr.
B00005MP58|5.0|It has been many years since reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice but had not seen the DVD version until I rented it recently.  After watching it twice, I HAD to own it!  The entire cast was wonderful and the chemistry between Elizabeth Ehle's Elizabeth and Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is what makes me want to watch it again and again.  Of any DVD you own, make this one part of your video library.  It reminds me of a richness, grace and politesse between people that is missing in today's society.
B00005JKL8|3.0|For a jingoistic, unrealistic popcorn movie that glorifies war, this is much better than it needs to be. Credit first-time helmer John Moore, who has a REALLY strong eye for visuals, convincingly capturing the chaos of battle, and even showing some ability to direct actors (unusual for a director of commercials). Director Moore even has the grace to slyly insert a piece of dialogue criticizing Hackman for risking the peace process and thousands of Bosnian lives for the sake of one American flyboy. And a tip of the hat to casting, which has a real find in the Bosnian sniper hunting Owen Wilson. In a seriously underwritten part, this actor manages to make the sniper character a convincing human being, which is no mean feat. Another special mention for animation--the effects are seamless. I never once got the impression that I was watching computer graphics and/or miniatures. Cinematography, stunts, wardrobe, and makeup are all first-rate. In general, the technical credits are flawless. Next time, Hollywood, give John Moore a crack at an excellent script and you might have another \\"Training Day\\" on your hands. That one was helmed by Antoine Fuqua, whose previous credits, \\"Bait\\" and \\"Replacement Killers\\" gave little or no hint of what he was capable of.

B00006RIO7|5.0|Being a fan of the stage version makes me incredibly biased and hyper-critical and that's why I'm saying that THIS VERSION is the DEFINITIVE orchestration for Kander and Ebb's incredibly jazz-hot score with some of the best voices EVER! Catherine Zeta-Jones has that infinitely superb, round, sumptuous tone AND the big Broadway \\"belter\\" pipes to boot! GOD she's awesome. Gorgeous to hear! Renee Zellweger adds some pretty fine crooning to her tunes as well and it's a wonderful nuance missing from the less authentic-to-the-period stage albums (both of which also have less-than-stellar voices in the chorus and supporting roles other than Velma and Roxie -- I LOVE Chita Rivera and Gwen Verdon as the original Velma and Roxie, though!). As an aside, I never used to like Roxie's songs from the stage albums until I heard Zellweger's versions for the movie. Way to go Renee! Richard Gere is just fantastic with all the style, pomp and brass you'd expect to hear from a smeary lawyer who says all he cares about is love...and, well, \\"five-thousand bucks\\" from his clients. Queen Latifah steams and rules as the Pearl Bailey-esque Matron Mama Morton, and John C. Reilly is the perfect Andy, I mean, Amos. And let's hear it for that highly addictive (and updated) rendition of the Cell Block Tango! HOT!! This album is truly fantastic, and that's saying something from a true fan of \\"Chicago\\" (AND I was born there, so watch out.) I absolutely LOVE this music, I love the voices, I can't stop playing it, it makes me dance over and over, and I want this album to go platinum. But I can't do it alone, so c'mon fellas. Here's to \\"all the things we hold near and dear to our hearts:\\" Chicago ROCKS for all that jazz!!
B000001FW9|4.0|The songs on this recording are somewhat hit or miss. Rabid fans of the group (of which I am one, as you can tell by my rating) will enjoy the interesting songs, instrumentation, mixture of styles, etcetera. Those new to the group should get &quot;Octopus&quot; and &quot;Freehand&quot; first. Then move on to &quot;Power and The Glory&quot; and &quot;Interview.&quot; Then &quot;In a Glass House.&quot; If you've gotten this far, you'll probably want to pick up the rest of their records. Avoid anything recorded after &quot;Interview.&quot;
0780631684|5.0|When I first saw this, right from the beginning, this movie grabbed hold and never let go, constantly pumping adrenaline into my body, and even had me shaking and screaming. It's that good, and I do believe I never paused this movie any time, either, which is very unlike me. This has to be my favorite thriller. I liked it even more than Scream. The Final Verdict: Buy.
0393312836|5.0|\\"Being the adventures of a young man whose principle interests are rape, ultra-violence, and Beethoven.\\" This is a quote from the movie poster of A Clockwork Orange. I think that that quote accurately describes the main character Alex. Burgess takes us deep into the mind of a teenager that enjoys shopcrasting, scapping, and the old in-out. Or in plain English shoplifting, fighting, and sex. Burgess uses a truly unique language throughout the book. He literally made up an entire language of made up slang words. Although it was quite confusing at first, I found that by the end of the book not only did I understand the words but I was actually using them in everyday conversations. Burgess also brings up deep social questions. He made me question some modern day practices of punishment. I have learned more from this book than any other I have read before. Truly a 20th century masterpeice and the best book I have ever read before. Viddy well my little Droogs.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Well, when this came to theaters, I just had to see it. I could not wait until it came to DVD. This had been the first movie I had seen at my local theater since July of 2000. It has been that because there was either nothing good on that I wanted to see, or I just wasn't hyped on any others like I had been with some others. Now, I do think that Dr. Evil and Mini-Me didn't have to wear those blue contacts, cause it kind of made them look ugly. Anyways, in this AP film, they poke fun at mostly everything since the last one, including Jared who lost all that weight, while being on the Subway diet. I won't ruin it for you, but if you are a fan of AP, then you need to buy this. Now, I'm not sure if I like the Infinifilm DVD's, but they're ok. Final Verdict: Buy.
0812550706|3.0|I've never been one for science fiction.  So when my humanities teacher said we had to read Ender's Game, I wasn't exactly eager.  I read the first two chapters when he told us to.  I read the 3rd and 4th chapters when they were assigned.  I read the fifth chapter just to get ahead.  But suddenly, I couldn't stop.  The story gripped me.  I read and read, and by the next day I had finished the book.  I didn't cry, but in my heart I felt like it.  Ender's Game brings up the questions of morality, of war, that are stored in our souls and are opened just when we pick up a book like this.  This book is one that broke me, because of the destruction of innocence, the constant manipulation, the infinite inner struggles of the characters that make you love and hate the author all at once: love him, because he makes you understand and feel it, and hate him for the same reason.  Ender's Game affirms that life isn't black and white.  Through the way the tale is woven with threads of simplicity, action, and true human feelings, the reader walks away with the knowledge that he must return.  Card tests our minds and our definitions of good and evil when he mixes the purest, whitest form of life with the darkest form of hatred: a child and war.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I just can't say enough about London Calling.  I still remember ripping the shrink wrap off the LP back in the cold winter of 1980 anticipating yet another great Clash album.  Then I was shocked.  It was even better than my lofty expectations.  I played it until the grooves were worn.  ...  I had never seen a band play with so much passion.  ...  Upon hearing of the tragically early death of singer guitarist Joe Strummer, I pulled the CD out for a spin.  Twenty two years have done nothing to dull the luster of this monumental work. From the ominous opening strains of London Calling to the pub-skank of Rudie Can't Fail, to the final fade of Train in Vain I was reminded of the sounds of a great band hitting their stride, filled with passion, humor and conviction. This remains one of my all time favorites. Rest in Peace Joe.
B00006RIO7|4.0|This is truly an outstanding version of the classic Kander/Ebb score. Catherine Zeta-Jones' rendition of &quot;All That Jazz&quot; is second best only to the amazing Chita Rivera [the original Velma]. Renee Zellweger does an excellent job with &quot;Roxie&quot;, I can't bear listening to Ann Reinking's rendition from the 1996 revival. Richard Gere shines most with &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; and Queen Latifah socks it to you with &quot;When You're Good To Mama&quot;. I could have lived without the hip-hop version of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; and Anastacia's &quot;Love is A Crime&quot;, which was &quot;inspired&quot; by the film.<BR>Luckily these two tracks are at the very end so my CD's laser lens will never go there. This CD will find a permanent place in my CD shelf alongside the legendary Original Broadway Cast Recording. If you loved this movie BUY IT you will not be disappointed.

When the author claims the Chinese landed in Cuba, that's when it's time to return the book.<br />Actually, what may have happened is that the author, who apparently is not a historian, mistook Chinese immigrant artifacts, which are found in San Francisco, CA and in Havana, Cuba, as evidence of pre-Columbus landings by the Chinese.  Or he is playing with the audience.<br />Not worth the money; and frankly an insult to the Chinese.
1883010039|5.0|This is the very best book I have seen or used to learn to weave.  It is extremely detail oriented and procedes in a step by step manner.

B000002HRE|5.0|Now before all you hard-core Metallica fans label me a traitor, I own every Metallica album and listened to nothing but them for over a year.  Now on with the review.  By the standards set by Metallica back in the 80s this is a pretty [weak] album.  I know you're thinking then why did he give it 5 stars?  The reason is simple, in the changing world of Metal, Metallica has created one of the best modern Metal albums out there.  Now a rating of all the tracks:<br />1. Fuel - A sweet opener to the CD really kicks 5/5<BR>2. The Memory Remains - Kinda an ironic track, since some people say the Metallica sold out, but a great song anyway. 5/5<BR>3. Devil's Dance - A bit slower but still a very solid song. 5/5<BR>4. The Unforgiven II - The follow-up to the now classic Black Album song. 5/5<BR>5. Better Than You - Very Catchy, but not their best work. 4/5<BR>6. Slither - Same as above. 4/5<BR>7. Carpe Diem Baby - Same as above again. 4/5<BR>8. Bad Seed - A pretty good song and pretty solid. 4/5<BR>9. Where The Wild Things Are - One of Jason Newstad's masterpieces. 5/5<BR>10. Prince Charming - Another solid song. 4/5<BR>11. Low Man's Lyric - Another slow and well done song. 5/5<BR>12. Attitude - One of the weaker songs of the album. 4/5<BR>13. Fixxxer - A great closer to a good album. 4/5<br />Ok, don't go in expecting Master Of Puppets, but do expect a very solid piece of work from arguably the best Metal band ever.  With the leaving of Jason Newstad a new era has started, lets hope it follows Re-Load's lead.
B00006RIO7|5.0|&quot;Chicago&quot; is one of the most creative adaptations of stage production to film ever.  All the elements of classic movie making happen here: great singing, dancing, acting, casting, pacing, creativity (and it is wisely kept under two hours to prove you don't have to be epic length to be epic quality).<br />The soundtrack to &quot;Chicago&quot; truly captures the essence of the film.  Brilliant arrangements, performances that convey character and inclusion of just enough mood setting dialogue to maintain the flow of energy established in the film.<br />Highlights are &quot;Cell Block Tango,&quot; &quot;Nowadays,&quot; and &quot;I Move On&quot; (which is original to the film, so hopefully it will be nominated for an Oscar and we'll get to see Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones perform it on the Oscar show).<br />Add the soundtrack to &quot;Chicago&quot; to the short list of classic movie soundtracks like &quot;West Side Story,&quot; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;---consider it a souvenir to help remember a fantastic movie.<br />Thank you Director Rob Marshall!

0151006903|5.0|What a refreshing delight it was to read Baudolino--quite a departure for Eco, at least in terms of tone.  Whereas his other novels are rather heavy, Baudolino has such a light touch, but thankfully is not \\"light\\" reading by any stretch of the imagination.  The year is 1204 and Constantinople is under siege.  Baudolino rescues Niketas, a historian and over the course of several days, recounts the story of his life, freely admitting at the outset that he is a liar and has told lies all his life.  The story he recounts is outrageous--exposing the relic market in the middle ages, the death of Frederick Barbarossa (Baudolino's adoptive father), the Holy Grail among other things.  It begins when Baudolino is about 12 and has an encounter with Frederick, who is so taken with him that he adopts him (although both parents were still living).  Baudolino goes to Paris to study and befriends the first of an amazing, amusing cast of characters that will accompany him on his journeys throughtout the novel.  They seek the Holy Grail, Prester John, unicorns, all sorts of fancy.  The novel is simply delightful, told with a light wit that at times reminded me of  Monty Python (probably simply because of the whole Holy Grail thing).  The novel is clever as well, because while it will make you smile, make you chuckle, it will also lead you to ponder about the nature of fiction versus truth in various capacities.  Eco is incredibly talented; none of his novels are really like the others, but all are wonderful.  This one is terrific.

THE REASON WHY REVIEWERS ARE GIVING LOAD & RELOAD 1 STAR IS BECAUSE THEY ARE BASING THERE JUDGEMENT ON THE OTHER CLASSIC METALLICA ALBUMS: (IE And Justice For All, Master of Puppets, Ride The Lighting, Kill Em All and Black).

6305081751|4.0|Mask reveals that the inner beauty is what really counts and makes a person beautiful or handsome. Cher gives an awesome performance as a single mother with a son who has a life threatening disease that causes him to be severely deformed in the face. But Cher helps him to see beyond that by showing love and support in everything her son, Rocky does(schoolwork, baseball cards and motorcycles).  He also helps her to see that her drug addiction limits her true inner beauty and eventually she quits and becomes clean. Every scene that they play together truely reveals the raw emotion between a mother and teenage son. The scene where his mother \\"talks\\" to his headache to make it go away is truely Oscar worthy material. It is rare to find a movie where a mother and teenage son bond and work together as a team with one common goal----to remove the \\"mask\\" and reveal the inner beauty in all of us.
1573301183|4.0|Im not a real big AIC fan. Regardless, this dvd is pretty good. These guys are ok but i prefer Nirvana and PJ and i think AIC will never be placed alongside these greats.. sorry guys!
B00005JLRR|3.0|On the plus side...Good performances (as always) by Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart. Fast paced plot, with no meandering subplots.  Better than average special effects.  Good ending.<br />On the minus side...Not much for the other stars to do except stand around.  Quite a number of absurdities (next time Captain Picard decides to ram a Romulan warship head-on he should remind the crew to fasten their seatbelts).<br />The biggest problem for me was the bad guys just weren't bad enough.  Considering how the Enterprise destroyed the Borg almost single-handedly, it's hard to take a pack of Romulan-Reman renegades seriously.  Maybe that's why the Next Gen movies are ultimately disappointing: it's tough to top the TV episodes!
0062502182|5.0|This a beautiful book about following your dream. It was well written and the characters are just wonderful. This and The Butterfly (Jay Singh) are the two books I would recommend for any one on the verge of following their dream. It's the little push between action and inaction.
B0000669JL|5.0|I've never listened to reggae before this and wasn't sure if I would like it.  A friend recommended it to me so I took a chance.  I play this in the car everywhere.  The lyrics and music both are excellent.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants to try something new and enjoys music at its best.
B00005JKZT|1.0|As a long time fan of the books I knew that it would be difficult if not impossible to make them into a movie(s) version.<BR>   The technology is there to do it, but Peter Jackson and his screenwriters did not do the story justice.<BR>   Yet if this will bring people to the truth, if this will get people to read the books and appreciate the genius of J.R.R. Tolkien then it will deserve the one star I give the movie(s).
B0000004V2|5.0|This may be the best album i have ever heard, i never, ever get tired of listening to it...there is something so addictive and spiritual about this band...i can't put my finger on it...Ian's whispery voice is hypnotizing, John's guitar, especially on \\"Fool's Gold\\" and \\"Elephant Stone\\" is something i've never heard before, like the edge of U2, Mani and Remi have amazing rhythm chemistry as well...i'm afraid this album dwarfs them all...it doesn't have the lyrics of the Joshua Tree or the originality of London Calling but the spirit, the spirit here is amazing...four young lads knowing how good they are but doing it from the heart, never knowing they would be legends, it ended before it started, what, one album and 2 years together...they make the Sex Pistols and Operation Ivy look like a joke in how many they will inspire to come...point blank, if you don't like this album, you're in deep ... with yourself...by the way, find the demo version of Elephant Stone, much, much better than the studio version, rawer, more heart...
B00005A3KS|5.0|This movie rocks! Buy it now! Horrible acting buy keanu, but what's new, he always sucks. But he can't ruin this movie. This is one great movie!
B00000BKDX|5.0|I've ALWAYS considered this the greatest live metal release of all time. I don't care what other band you can name, live metal doesn't get (or sound) as good as this, ever. I remember way back when this actually came out, I'm that old!, on Halloween, walking into the record store and seeing a massive wall of Live after Death albums (yes, back when there were records!) all out on display. And what a display! Maiden has always come through with their cover art. You can never get tired of Eddie artwork. I'm a power/melodic metal freak, and have also maintained that Maiden was the first true, power metal band. Hearing them live on here, just blows you away. I don't think there's one night since this came out, when I've chosen to play it, that I didn't have to hear the whole thing: you can't just slap on 5 songs on this and flick over to another disc; you have to hear it in its entirety. If you don't own this, or are a new Maiden fan and want to hear the best musicians in this genre live, at the height of there career back then, then get this immediately! I'd give a 20 star rating if it went that high. ***** 5 STAR LIVE METAL LOUDNESS RATING! Cheers from Scraggy's Tomb! PS... and when you play this, play it the way it was meant to be played: LOUD!!!!!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|As we watch the CABARET movie on our VCR, and we listen to Julie Andrews sing THE SOUND OF MUSIC's theme song, we, as the world, are in awe with the new CHICAGO movie.<BR> It's really amazing how this will change everyone's lives for years to come. How many generations have grown up watching THE WIZARD OF OZ? Soon CHICAGO will be a favorate that we can all pass on to the youth!<BR> As everyone has stated before, Renee', Catherine and Richard are simply amazing! SEE CHICAGO! AND IF NOT, BUY THIS CD! I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE UPSET!
B00004Y6NT|5.0|This album seems tighter than the first, although it wasn't near as popular - only the 'Sultans' copycat 'Lady Writer' seemed to get any radio airplay. While I'm not a fond of 'Once Upon a Time in the West' as the others, the album is a good solid play all the way through - no getting up to skip any songs. The counterpoint guitar and solo of 'News' is beautiful, and listen for some wonderfully subtle volume pedal work. The beginning guitar licks of 'Where Do You Think You're Going?' blend perfectly with the ending of 'News'. 'Communique' is a bouncy unpretentious song the revolves around a great little Strat riff - some find it monotonous as it seldom leaves A major, but it works for me. 'Lady Writer' has better-than-it-deserves guitar work, but seems a bit derivative of 'Sultans of Swing'. 'Angel of Mercy' shifts the gears back down to where Dire Straits is at their best - mid-tempo blues/rock. 'Portobello Belle' reintroduces Mark's steel guitar work, although in a simpler manner than 'Wild West End' 'Single-Handed Sailor' took a couple of listens to get into, but is another better-than-it-first-seems tunes. 'Follow Me Home' - well, if it fell off the album I wouldn't miss it, but it's not bad enough to skip.<BR>David left the band after this album, suddenly they were famous, and became \\"Springsteen-ized\\" by Jimmy Iovine on Making Movies, so they would never again have this sound again. Shame - I liked the old Dire Straits better.<br />PS - and to the reviewer who gave the album 0 stars because he couldn't play it on his PC - what does the inablity to play it on a PC or Mac have to do with the quality of the material? How lame...
B00005OAIE|1.0|If you have any prior sense of music, play any instrument or are in any means influenced by the works of musicians who write and sing music based on soul and hardship, heartbreak and life, and not about sissy highschool relationships than this is definetly  not the album for you.  To musicians, his craftmanship and prue subject matter in his songs, i.e. your body is a wonderland,  is awful, and awe astounding, but being that the music industry is in it for the quick buck it is no wonder such a pop teen orientated artist is such a hint.  Ive fallen for such *** before but ive graduated highschool and i feel that my music should move along with me, but it seems johns hasnt.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Quite simply, the movie version of the hit Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot; is a superb translation of the material to the big screen.  It stands alongside &quot;Cabaret&quot; as one of the best adaptations of music theater onto film in all of cinema.  The sheer ingenuity, technical know-how, and thought behind taking this stylized vaudeville-themed play, and making it believable as a film, is breathtaking and cause for cheering.  First-time feature director Rob Marshall has instantly revitalized the genre, and we are forever grateful for his talent and his taste.<br />The soundtrack album presents the show's shimmering, jazzy Kander/Ebb songstack in the best possible light.  Yes, numbers have been cut from the play, but what's up on the screen and on the soundtrack more than compensates for any editing of the score as a whole.  Much like the movie of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, the numbers are all presented on stages of various sorts (albeit in the mind of Rene Zellwegger's Roxie Hart) - and this allows the songs to be carefully constructed as both stage AND movie musical numbers.  What a triumph of style, ability, and visual sensitivity!  The movie is so good that you want it to go on longer, and the great companion soundtrack album presents all of the film's score, along with a new, hip-hop version of &quot;The Cell Block Tango&quot; and the terrific new closing-credits number written by the original composers for the film, &quot;I Move On&quot;.<br />This score is one of the best of modern Broadway, and the film and album do it great justice.  A winner all the way down the line, if you like musicals you'll love &quot;Chicago&quot;, and if you love musicals, you'll be enraptured by the sensational musicality of this film.  Hats off to every single person who brought this to the screen, it is fabulous.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I haven't been an Incubus fan for too long but I must admit when I bought Morning View it made me go back and buy their previous records.  Personally, I liked Make Yourself better.  Morning view is musically a very good record but most of the tracks Brandon is whining about a girl who cheated on him and except for about 4 songs this record is a break up record and I'm not a fan of those.  Lyrically, Brandon is an excellent writer and the other musicians are very talented as well. Incubus is the only band that has a REAL DJ in their group and I credit DJ Killmore for putting Incubus on the map.<br />1. Nice to know you (good song, good lyrics positive vibe)<br />2. Circle (Mike's guitar is excellent in this song and the message is basically what goes around comes around)<br />3. Wish you were here (yeah it is radio friendly but it was an upbeat song and somewhat romantic, great melody)<br />4. Just a Phase (it takes to long to get started and it wasn't one of my favorites it was another bitter break up song)<br />5. 11am (a musically and lyrically beautiful song..basically Brandon is expressing the \\"indecision\\" he feels about ending a relationship...see the patten here?)<br />6. Blood on the ground (another amazing song Mike's guitar stands out again and once again its about his bitterness toward the girl who cheated on him..she must be crazy by the way! \\"then again\\" there's two sides to every story)<br />7. Mexico (beautiful melody, ok lyrics, Brandon has a terrific voice!)<br />8. don't remember this track<br />9. Warning (upbeat and I liked the video too.. \\"don't ever let life pass you by\\"!)<br />10. forgot this one too<br />11. Are you In! (One of my favorites..Incubus always has one song on every album that blows you away..on Make Yourself it was track 10 that Battlestar song and on Science it was track 9 Summer Romance..and this was one of them it was a nice suprise and a sexy song just like the video Dirk's bass stands out on this he very talented and cute too!)<br />12. forgot but I know it was a break up song too.<br />13. Aqueous transmission (hope I spelled that right, anyway this was the experimental track it was a nice try but the track didn't really do anything for me another reflection of breaking up)<br />All in all it was a great record but except for 4 songs the whole record is a testament to Brandon's broken heart which is OK because as he says in 11am \\"I am only a Man\\"  Not their best work because it was too down and reminded me too much about how it feels to be broken hearted. I do recommend it though!  They are a talented and diverse young band. Incubus Rocks!I know it was a break up song too.<BR>13.

B000002IOW|4.0|Rush is typically characterized as being a progressive rock band.  I believe this is true, although is most descriptive of their 80's music (Signals, Power Windows, Presto, etc.).  This is not my favorite Rush album, but it certainly ranks up there as one of the best, if not their best PROGRESSIVE sound---great integration of keyboards and guitar, crisp bass, as well as timing changes make this a very unique album.  A must of have for anyone into progressive rock.
0688091717|5.0|I love this story because it exemplifies the importance of individuality!  This is a wonderful lesson for children to see how everyone is unique.  The illustrator did a great job of producing pictures that enhance the text.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I cannot believe that anybody would find anything negative to say about this album.  This CD is brilliant & absolutely amazing; & a masterpiece of musical perfection lyrically, musically, vocally, & in its prduction.  CA also proves that she is no longer a pop teenie bopper.  She has matured into a confident take-charge industry professional & extremely talented songwriter & producer.  I am a 32 year old music fan of all types & must say that Stripped is one of, if not, the most incredible album to date.  This is also saying alot since I own over 300 CD's in all different musical genres.  I also wish people would get over her image.  Quite honestly, I can't understand all the hype.  She's a phenominal talent I've seen many other artists including male & female either themselves or portrayed through others express much more racey sexual content than CA. With CA's talent it is very easy to overlook. Loosen up people. I would love to see this album recieve a Grammy nom for 2004.  It definitely deserves a Grammy for Album of the Year.  Way to go CA.  Hope we don't have to wait as long for the next record.  This album will attract anyone of any musical interest.  GO BUY IT.
0780622553|5.0|As others have said, it's basically the same story as The Matrix w/o the cheesy kungfu fight scenes.  John Murdock wakes naked in a bath with no memories and no idea why there's a dead/mutilated hooker in the next room.  He's hunted both by the police and strange, superhuman denizens of Dark City, the city that never sees the day and there's no way to leave.  Along the way he discovers the secret of Dark City and why everyone seems to change nightly.
0743216385|5.0|Ambrose is a master storyteller, and this is an amazing story to tell.  In lean, terse prose similar to Hemmingway's, Ambrose follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne from basic training to Hitler's bunker with first-hand testimony and first-rate military analysis.  Easy Company is able to overcome an incredible amount of adversity and get out of tough situations because they simply refuse to give up for the sake of the men around them.  This is a powerful tale of personal sacrifice for a selfless cause.  Of all Ambrose's works, this is perhaps the most difficult to put down.  This book should be read for the sake of its historical significance as well as its unforgettable narrative.
B00000J2PH|3.0|Its a very good cd but Carole King sings with so much more enthusiasm now than when she recorded this - it is a bit wishywashy to her true talent.
B000005HN6|5.0|This debut by opeth is  very original because of all the great soft sounds that makes it sound like pink floyd,hendrix and even simon&garfunkel. I do enjoy listining to them alot. Great zone out type of music. Death metal still lives !!
B00005JKCH|5.0|When I was talked into seeing this film, I wasn't expecting much.  Well, was I wrong... it's terrific.  Pure fantasy, of course, but what a fun story.  Pure good vs. pure evil, and throw in a little romance.  Lots of fun for everyone.  Based on the Spiderman comic book character, it's even better.  Great effects without being a cartoon.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot's selftitle is pretty  good because of all the original songs,lirycs,drums and the fact that this guys are actullie pretty fast. I bought slipknot's selftitle the day it was out and im proud to say that  i bought it and own this amazing album. I have to say my favorite tracks are \\"sic\\",\\"liberate\\", \\"spit it out\\" , \\"wait and bleed\\" , \\"eyeless\\"  and \\" no life\\". I realy do love slipknot's selftitle !! Buy it !!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I loved this movie--trippy characters, high adventure, beautifully rendered.  I've never seen any of this Miyazaki guy's other stuff and am not a big anime fan (I still don't get Akira after seeing it endlessly replayed on cable a few years ago), but this was awesome.  <br />How could you not like the wacky tale of a girl whose parents are turned to pigs and is forced to work for an evil Granny in a bathhouse (brothel?) for the gods?
B00005JLSC|5.0|I had a smile through out the entire film. everyone in the movie did an award winning performance.<BR>I could see it again just to have a another good laugh.
B00005JLS0|4.0|Funny, warm and fast moving.  Delightful change of pace.  It was like having a vacation from the reality of life.  Great Getaway....
B00006RU5B|5.0|I would the best new band of 2002 is Audioslave they 1st single Cochise is Super. Soon they will be bring out thy 2nd single of there album and the song is called 'Like a Stone' Audioslave Album i think is up at the top in my mind as one of the best album of the year. My advice is if you don't have this album then i say you should go out and buy it it is pure class.
B000002UR7|4.0|\\"Pablo Honey\\" doesn't get much respect, even from die-hard fans, many of whom cite \\"The Bends\\" as the true beginning of the Radiohead they know and love. However, many of the elements that made \\"The Bends\\" so outstanding are present here. The arpeggiated mixed with the crunchy, Ed's articulate guitar and Johnny's soundscaping, trademark Radiohead riffage, desperate lyrics over a deceptively upbeat melody; it's all here.<br /><br />Amid this collection, four tracks stand out as excellent. \\"Creep,\\" for all its simplicity and early-90s saturation, still resonates.  \\"Prove Yourself\\" taps into the horrors of the quarter-life crisis. \\"Lurgee,\\" a simple love song, is absolutely haunting.  And the closer, \\"Blow Out,\\" is a gorgeous song that goes beyond visions of \\"The Bends\\" and dabbles in what would become the territory of \\"OK Computer.\\"<br /><br />A handful of the songs-- \\"How Do You?,\\" \\"Stop Whispering\\" and \\"I Can't\\"-- find Radiohead still searching for their sound, the end result being very British-rock. However, the remainder of the tracks are classic Radiohead and are clear indications of where the band was headed. This was the birth of a giant and no Radiohead fan can be without this album.
B000003RCY|5.0|When Rammstein debuted, they were quickly scrutizied because they spoke only in German and they were an extremely &quot;heavy metal&quot; band.  In America, this sort of ingenuity classifies you as Satanic or something.<br />This is absolutely not the case with Rammstein, they are a truly great band.  No one else can sustain the aggresive, searing guitars and tenacity as Rammstein and actually NOT sound the same and monotonous on every track.  They should be known for their metal/industrial style, not as just another heavy metal band.<br />If you are not convinced, here are some interpretations of the track titles.  The album title, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; is Heartache in our native tongue.  &quot;Der Meister,&quot;a very good track, translates to The Man.  &quot;Weisses Fleisch&quot;, another good one, is White Flesh. &quot;Asche Zu Asche&quot; is Ashes to Ashes. The track &quot;Seamann&quot; is as mellow you will ever hear these guys play, it is a ballad titled The Sailor.  &quot;Riechst So Gut&quot; is You Smell so Good. &quot;Heirate Mich&quot; was the first song I ever heard by Rammstein (from the movie Lost Highway) and it means Marry Me, though the actual lyrics have very little to do with the title. That's something you should look into on your own time!  Those are all the ones I could interpret.  It was interesting to actually find out what was being said in these songs.<br />This turned out to be more of a lecture than a review, I am sorry!  None the less, there guys are intense. It doesn't matter what they are brooding about, they will have you banging your head.
B00000IGGA|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the earlier Tom Waits stuff. This album is just plain bad. The tunes are bad, the words are bad, and the singing is beyond bad. It may be time for Tom to hang it up. He hasn't done anything worthwhile in quite a while.
0316666343|5.0|Having just finished this wonderful story, I so wish that I knew someone who has read &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; so I could talk about it!  What captivated me and carried me through this story was the narration; the entire story being told by a 14 year old girl who had died and was living in heaven.  There are few people, I suppose, who do not wonder what heaven is like, but I have wondered and I love the way Ms. Seybold chose to portray Suzie's heaven as her very own heaven....that it's not the same for everyone. I was also drawn into the relationships of her family and friends as it was told through Suzie's eyes.  The connections that Suzie made with her loved ones were written is such a powerful way, I could sometimes &quot;feel&quot; the sadness or the happiness.  Having never read a book a second time, I WILL re-read this book;  I almost cannot wait to start it again.  &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; and Suzie Salmon will stay with me for a long, long time.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie was my favorite when it first came out when I was about 5.  Now it is still my favorite movie of all time.  In my opinion this was the greatest movie Disney has ever produced.  The animation was stunning the music was heatwarming and the characters were fun.  I recently bought the DVD and I was stunned at how beautiful it was.  It was even more magical then before.  The DVD in itself is also great.  It has stuff on the movie music videos different film versions games etc.  It is one of the best DVD's I have ever seen.  The best part the is the stunning movie it is completly heartwarming and wonderful.  If you do not have it, get it because you are missing out on the best movie ever made.
B00000HZH7|5.0|I first saw Possessed in 1984 before Seven Churches was released when they opened for Slayer and Venom at the Stone in SF.  They played a 4 song set which included 'Swing of the Axe' that only appeared on one of the early Metal Massacre records.  They were...unbeleivable then and when Seven Churches came out it killed everything.  Nobody had their power.  I still beleive 'Hell Awaits' is the greatest hardcore metal album ever but it is not Death Metal.  Seven Churches spawned the new genre.  They predated, Death, Napalm Death, Morbid; everybody and they all sounded like Possessed afterwards.  I agree with most reviewers about the poor sound quality but you have to take it into context.  Compare this album with anything else at the time and you'll understand just how GREAT this CD does sound given the times. This band is a one-hit wonder 'cause 'Beyond the Gates' sucks and they had no more time to regroup.  Larry Lalonde jumped ship to Primus (an obvious good move for him) and Possessed was no more.  If you dig today's death metal then you MUST buy this cd for it's the root.
0676973779|4.0|I didn't want to post a review -- just ask some questions of others who have read this book.<br />In terms of symbolism -- what did you understand the meerkat island to represent?<br />What is your interpretation of the meeting with the French castaway?
0380778556|4.0|This is a marvleous story about a young naive girl who is picked up in Monte Carlo, France by a wealthy, powerful aristocrat.  As soon as she reaches Manderley, the estate in which her new husband lives, she begins to wonder why the house is so...eerie.  She is constantly compared to the prior Mrs. de Winter who was beautiful, charming, and perfect...  Little by little the new Mrs. de Winter realizes that there is a deeper story to the death of the late Mrs. de Winter than that which has been rumored.<br />  This is truely a must-read.  The captivating story is so mysterious and exciting, you cannot put it down.
0792837622|5.0|Some may say young people will not like this movie. I say, it is the best I have ever seen. I may be a &quot;modern teenager,&quot; but I can still watch this movie 10+ times and cry every time.<br />The movie has such wonderful songs, acting, and yes, dancing. Do gangs really dance? No. Does this movie's choreography dazzle the viewer and create a dramatic atmosphere perfect in which to recreate one of the best love stories of all time? Yes.<br />This movie has never lost its appeal to me. I watch this movie and still find hidden meanings. The movie takes up racism so gracefully, yet powerfully, you can't help but feel sympathy for those who come to this country expecting a beacon of freedom and hope, and are instead met with discrimination and prejudice. <br />Kids my age should all watch this movie, as should everyone. If you look past the gangs dancing (which, by the way, can be one of the purest and most beautiful forms of human expression ever), you will see a classic film, one that should be seen by everyone with a social conscience. West Side Story is one of the best films ever made.
0064407667|1.0|This book is horrible and creepy - from the children losing their parents in a fire, to being shipped off to their spooky uncle, Count Olaf.  The Count threatens and mistreats the kids, and then plots to marry the eldest daughter Violet (who is like 12) in order to take over the family fortune.  I would not want a young person/teenager to read this book.  It was billed as Harry-Potter-like, but it totally lacked the sweetness and humor of Harry.  I was creeped out and disappointed!
B00006LSM3|4.0|R.I.P. GH you was a legend may your legacy live on.
B000002URV|5.0|Before Enigma,New Age was rather dry with some exceptions of course.Enigma took Gregorian chants,opera,Islamic chants,classical tones,elements of rock,funk and soul and mixed them all with infectious beats.Regarded by many today to be somewhat simplistic,it seems that so many have forgotten how Enigma's first truly revolutionized the entire New Age genre spawning countless others to follow.Enigma singlehandedly put world musc on the map for a younger generation while even the older generation couldn't help but like it.Even after the controversy that followed mixing Gregorian chants with sexual overtones,Enigma only flourished.If you are into this genre and like Delerium,Deep Forest,Era,Lesiem,Magna Canta,B-Tribe,Myth,Mythos,the Pure Moods series and all the rest,do yourself a favor and pick up the one that started it all.A true musical landmark!
B0000255CL|4.0|The early days of Immortal produced turbulent, asocial, murderous savant black metal art that displayed a deeply Romantic worldview with blinding speed and engulfing distortion. Having made four great black metal albums, the band began cycling back into death metal (as they had been in their previous band), and had the presence of mind to consciously change directions. \\"At the Heart of Winter\\" is a heavy metal album with black metal vocals, keyboards and similar neoclassical themes, but its main agenda is solid songs with unforgettable melodic hooks, bringing the listener into its rousing and stomping pace for Viking rock with some guts. For one, there's no waffling around with attempts to make songs \\"diverse\\" by mixing in other styles, just a solid mix of epic riffs and evocative rhythm. Also, this album carefully avoids any substandard material in composition and production both, creating an experience that is wholly believable from start to finish. If you're seeking underground necroblack metal, this will be a mistake, but for the metal listener looking for the best extreme metal you could still play on the radio, this is the best of that group.
B00006V9A0|5.0|i love nirvana, but dont you think it is a little odd on how there newest song starts out, i will never bother you, i will never promise to, i will never follow you, i will never bother you, never speak a word again, i will crawl away for good. i mean this is the last song we ever got to hear from kurt, dave, and krist, and in a way it is like a last explanation of why kurt did what he did, (even though his whole suicide is still sketchy to me)just a little ironic i guess and i had to share buy the album it is a classic            peace and love

B00005YW4H|2.0|I saw Norah when she first performed on TV with Willie Nelson and friends, I was floored  by her voice and piano talent collectively.It was oddly enough Emmy Lou Harris @ 22, mixed with a touch of Patsy Cline, and a small dose of Bonnie Raitt. Incredible!! Can't wait for the nest CD.
B00006BTCA|5.0|.... I think this is one of the best cd's to come out in recent years. It really stirs me up emotionally and i usually start yelling the lyrics when i listen to Interpol. Their songs are full of beautiful and original ideas. Some of their songs are simple, others are complex and have a lot of exciting changes, but either way they all manage to create  brilliant soundscapes with their cool, moody melodies. The singers voice is really nice too.. it kind of sounds like a cross between David Bowie and Van Morrison, which means he has a really good voice for the sound Interpol creates. I especially like Obstacle 1, PDA, the last song, and Hands Away. Further adding to their credibility is that their songs all sound different, ranging from all out rocking out (Obstacle 1) to really dark, moody.. um, \\"ballads\\", like hands free and NYC. Its a very catchy cd that will remain in constant circulation for a while. Will New Wave angst ever be recreated? lets hope not.
B000006MV8|5.0|Simply put...Badfinger's Straight Up is one of the greatest albums to ever be recorded...by anyone. And this CD is easily the best that this star-crossed band ever recorded (Wish You Were Here is 2nd best). Every song is exceptional in it's own way. Don't think any further....go buy this CD now.
B000068PQ0|1.0|Whats funny is that many people seem to argue that any negative criticism of this album will surely come from people who are not adventurous enough to accept minimalist guitar and a large helping of synthsizers and electronic sounds, but while i really like the albums that this one is compared to (kid a, ok computer, bjorks later stuff), i really dont like this album's style at all. I guess in keeping with its theme, the flaming lips decided to make these songs sound like something off of the intro or credits to a bad anime cartoon series.. thats about how awkward a lot of these songs come off to me. And yeah, the singers voice is kind of whiny too, like a lot of other people have already mentioned. Maybe their other stuff is better, but its all way too girly for me. It lacks the genuine melancholy and transcendent feeling of a lot of other electronic music you could be listening to today.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Edward Norton shines in this brilliant risk-taking film.  An open mind is essential in order to follow the plot's twists and turns.  I gained a new respect for Brad Pitt as an actor-he has shown growth and an understanding of what it means to be a character foil.
0765342294|3.0|I'm sure my reviewer rank is going to get clobbered for this one but I have to complain about this book.  I've been putting off reading Ender's Game for about 8 years now.  Every time I would get in a discussion about books the question would come up and I would have to shamefully hang my head and admit to not having read IT yet.  \\"But I do have it on my hot list, and I am planning on reading it soon.\\" I would declare lamely.<br /><br />So last year I made a New Year's Resolution to finally read it.  I finally found it on tape unabridged and drove about 40 minutes to a library in a different city to pick it up.<br /><br />Over the course of two weeks I read/listened to it and I was in shock.  Nothing happened.  It was generic sci-fi.  Halfway through I started to realize the story wasn' about him fighting aliens, it was about him training to fight aliens and actually my favorite part was what was happening with his brother and sister back on earth.<br /><br />I never really understood the political situation on earth, who was allied with whom, or what the hedgemon was.<br /><br />Yes of course I was touched by the little boy's plight but the entire book was just a bunch of filler so that he could pull off a startling climax.  Then there's the last chapter or two which should have just been stapled into the book as a late addition. The chapter should have been titled -Setup for the Sequel-. It just didn't fit, it was like you saw someone turn off the video camera and then start it back up somewhere else.  I believe he should have kept it a short story, the climax wasn't worth 300 pages of semi-boring, (though well written) fluff.<br /><br />I think comparing this book to Dune is like comparing -Tom & Jerry- to -The Simpsons-.  It's a whole different level of entertainment.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|Regardless of your stance on the death penalty, this remains a difficult movie to watch, and perhaps that's exactly what makes Dead Man Walking a great movie.  <br />The movie centers around a nun named Sister Helen Prejean (played by Susan Sarandon) who befriends a convicted murderer and rapist named Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in the State of Louisiana.  Poncelet first seeks Sister Helen's help in filing his appeal and obtaining legal representation.  She is at his side through all the legal proceedings, and once Poncelet's chances for clemency are exhausted, she then helps him prepare for the execution by giving him spiritual guidance.  Sister Helen must also try and allay the hurt and betrayal felt by the parents of the children that Poncelet was convicted of murdering.  <br />This movie's greatest strength is the tremendous performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.  Both were given Academy Award nominations for their roles, and Sarandon actually won the Oscar for Best Actress.  I would have given this movie a 5 star rating, but I wasn't completely satisfied with the way in which the friendship between Sister Helen and Matthew Poncelet developed.  In movies where two people from opposite walks of life come together for a given purpose, both usually walk away a little wiser and with a broader perspective.  Sean Penn's character showed these changes, but Susan Sarandon's character was the same at the end of the movie as it was at the beginning.  According to this movie, Sister Helen had learned nothing valuable or life-altering from her friendship with Matthew Poncelet.    <br />When it first came out, this movie generated a great deal of public discussion about the death penalty.  Those who support capital punishment believe that, in theory, there are certain crimes so heinous that those who commit them should be required to forfeit their life as restitution.  This movie shows the huge difference between theory and reality.  I think people might change their minds about capital punishment once they see that carrying out this theory requires strapping a guy onto a gurney, sticking a needle into his arm, and injecting him with lethal chemicals.  I'll probably think about this movie for a long time to come, and it's entirely possible that it may sway my opinion on the death penalty.<br />Regardless of your stance on this controversial subject, this movie is guaranteed entertainment, and a definite must-see!
6305428042|1.0|If you are a pagan looking for a good movie for your children this movie is not it! I can't imagine making the Salem Witch trials an object of fun. If you want something good to watch buy the British/ Canadian series called the \\"Worst Witch\\" or watch Harry Potter again. This is just another Disney demonizing of witches and /or pagan. It's no wonder they had a lot of problems on set filming this movie or that at the time it came out the pagans in Los Angeles held major protests. Avoid this movie its not fun in the least.
1559409002|1.0|It 's Halloween night. Scary movie fest at my house.  This one came highly recommended, the guy behind the counter at the video store said it \\"disturbed him for days\\".  After watching this, I think he'd probably say that about the Muppet Movie as well.<BR>Why do people hold up examples of cheap desperation such as Carnival of Souls as Art?  With all of Herk's experience as an educational film maker, you would think he had learned something about technique.  This is the sloppiest movie I've seen since Plan 9 From Outer Space!!  <BR>I tried really hard to get into this one.  And I must admit that the main actress chick had a hauntingly wierd kind of a face that almost worked, if only she didn't have dialougue!!!<BR>I REALLY tried. But the waves of laughter from the audiece just put the last nail in the coffin.<BR>Sorry.  This one's a [dud].
B000002G60|5.0|Suzanne Vega has produced an amazing body of work since her debut in the 80's and picking a favorite album is difficult. At the end of the day however, I keep coming back to Nine Objects Of Desire. I love everything about this record. Amazing lyrics, mesmerizing music, jazzy attitude...it's just too good. The chemistry between Vega and producer Mitchell Froom, who I think she was either dating or married to at the time, give's this album a sensuality not found on her other albums. The sweet &amp; sour chemistry of artist and producer here is pure magic.
0140177396|3.0|This book is about George and Lennie traveling together to soledad for jobs and hopefully they can own a farm by themselves. So they work hard. Lennie is a huge man, had the mind of a young child. George is small and quick. They're best friends.  George always tries to protect Lennie from getting hurt. He helps Lennie to solve his problems and everything else.  In the end everything is just not what i expected.  This book is kind of interesting because it tells the meaning of friends and loneliness through life.  And how white people discriminated against the Blacks back in the days.  I do recommend this book if someone is looking to know how it's like to feel discrimated, loneliness and friendship.
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is the beautiful, original American film, directed by--surprise--British director, Sam Mendes.<br />PLOT SUMMARY: Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, an average, everyday, hard working father/husband, who works for a magazine...boring job. His wife, Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is an overahciever, work-aholic, real estate seller. And his teenage daughter, Jane Burnham (Thora Birch), is rebellious and conceited--or so we think. Lester is going through a mid-life crisis, and his life is going down the drain. First, he finds out that Carolyn is having an affair with her arch rival, the successful real estate seller, Buddy Kane (Pete Gallagher). Lester always used to do whatever Carolyn wanted, to avoid arguing or getting a divorce, but now he's starting to stick up for himself. He just met Jane's new high school friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and he's fallen in love with her beauty. Jane is being stalked by the teenage boy next door who's family just moved to town, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Lester wants to get to know his daughter better, but she refuses to spend more time with him, after she finds out that he likes her best friend. Lester also quits his terrible job when they hire a new vice president, begins to exercise in hopes that he will be able to impress Angela, and even starts smoking pot with Ricky, who he's befriended, though he doesn't realize Ricky likes his daughter. Ricky's abusive, gay-hating father, Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), also has a dark secret...which you will learn when you watch the film.<br />OVERALL THOUGHTS: \\"American Beauty\\" is a thought-provoking film. It's poignant and entertaining. Sam Mendes does an incredible directing job. The cinematography is stunning, and the music is haunting. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb--especially the performance given by Kevin Spacey. The storyline and script are amazing. There's a good twist to the ending, which makes it original and stands out from all the rest that are similar to it.<br />The DVD extras are a nice finishing touch to the DVD. This DVD includes a making of the film featurette, exclusive storyboards, commentary, production notes, and theatrical trailers.<br />I highly recommend \\"American Beauty\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
0783225792|4.0|Casino was a victim of bad timing. Released within the same five year span as Scorcese's absolute masterpiece Goodfellas, the comparisons were inevitable. Is Casino as good as Goodfellas? Flat out...No. But not many films are. Casino deserved the chance to stand on it's own merits but with De Niro and Pesci seemingly reprising their Goodfellas roles it's difficult for that to happen. Nonetheless, Bobbie D does a bang-up job as Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, a professional gambler who is hand-picked to run the Tangiers Casino for a consortium of Mafia bosses from around the country. Pesci plays Nicky Santoro, the Mob's enforcer who comes to Las Vegas for one reason...to take over. As usual the performances are stunning, De Niro and Pesci work together as well as any screen tandem I've ever seen. Sharon Stone does a great job as Ace's two-timing, drug addicted, gold-digging wife. I've always despised her as a person but I have to give credit where credit is due. The more I've watched this film the more hysterical the mob bosses are to me, if this is the way the mob is really run then their in big time trouble. Anyway, as always things start of great but turn out real bad in the end for some people in Casino. It's a long film but worth the ride and a fine addition to any DVD collection. Recommended.
6305428522|5.0|Quiz Show is a remarkably good film, presenting in vivid detail an important if disillusioning piece of Americana.  I understand the events as presented here are quite accurate to the truth of the actual events, but the film is so gripping and so full of implications about the America that was and was yet to be that it has the appearance of a brilliant screen play made exclusively for Hollywood.  Honesty, integrity, greed (both personal and corporate), betrayal, politics, discrimination, disillusionment-this movie is filled to the brim with these themes and many more besides.  The story is rather simple.  Long-running Twenty-one champion Herb Sempel is a contemporary version of Everyman, winning the acclaim he has sought his whole life only to lose it when America begins growing tired of this Jewish underdog (and I mention he was Jewish only because that fact does have some bearings in the story).  With ratings slipping, producer Don Enright compels him to take a dive so that he can be replaced by the charming, good-looking, academic, viewer magnet Charles Van Doren.  Van Doren, with a lot of help from the producers, goes on a record-breaking run as champion while NBC's viewership rises sharply and the sponsor's sales increase 50%.  Humiliated that he was forced to purposely miss an easy question and furious that his expectations to land a spot elsewhere on television go unfulfilled by the network, Sendel cries foul to a grand jury.  The story is quickly hushed up behind courtroom doors, but then an upstart Washington lawyer working for a Congressional oversight subcommittee hears word of the rumors and sets out to ferret out the truth.<br />The acting in this movie is top-notch indeed.  John Turturro is wonderful as Herb Sempel, David Paymer and Hank Azaria are convincingly slimy and fast-talking as producers Albert Freedman and Dan Enright, and remarkably talented supporting players such as Paul Scofield and Martin Scorsese make this movie something special, but it is the performance of Rob Morrow in the role of lawyer Dick Goodwin and Ralph Phiennes as Charles Van Doren that really steal the show.  (As an aside, look for Ally McBeal's Calista Flockhart in a cameo role as a young coed mooning over her suddenly famous instructor.)  These are some complex characters: Sempel is a somewhat paranoid man obsessed with the fame that was taken away from him yet not without secrets himself, but Van Doren is exceedingly hard to read.  Oftentimes seemingly ashamed of the fraud he knows he is committing, he allows himself to rationalize his situation, buying into notions that he is doing the right thing by inspiring youngsters to study harder and bringing entertainment to the masses.  Beneath all of his motivations lies a seemingly innate need to make his Pulitzer-winning father proud of him and to step out from the shadows of the Van Doren name he secured by birthright alone.  I must admit that the lawyer's motivations are somewhat inscrutable to me.  Fired up over the chance to \\"nail television,\\" he is reluctant to implicate everyone despite his zeal for bringing the fraud to light; in the end, it's hard to really say what his most basic motivations are.  Any ambiguity I feel over Goodwin's motives is dwarfed by the magnificence of the movie as a whole, however.  Clocking in at over two hours, there is not a slow spot to be found anywhere; each scene is dripping with tension and drama.  Its subtleties make for great rewatchability, as everything that takes place is important, even though it may not seem so at the time.  Van Doren in particular is a marvelous character study in this amazing cinematic morality play.<br />Having appeared on a game show myself, I thought I might be able to offer a unique perspective on this movie, but its lessons are undeniably universal.  I can say that the legacy of this scandal remains vibrant indeed in our own time-I and my fellow contestants were not allowed to bring anything with us to the studio, we were not permitted to go anywhere (including the bathroom) alone all day, and we had to search the faces of the audience in front of us to make sure that no one we knew was in our field of vision.  Anyone watching this movie should answer the question that Goodwin answered for himself: if you had been in Van Doren's place, placed under extreme pressure, knowing the eyes of millions would be studying your every move, would you have been a party to a fraud promising you fabulous riches?  Beyond providing over two hours of gripping entertainment, this movie compels you to learn something about yourself, and that is one of many reasons why Quiz Show is a certifiably five-star movie.o, we were not permitted to go anywhere (including the bathroom) alone all day, and we had to search the faces of the audience in front of us to make sure that no one we knew was in our field of vision.

B00007E8V4|5.0|Unbelievably, Steal This Album, a collection of tracks cut during the same sessions as Toxicity, steals the show in the metal genre so far for 2003. It shouldn't come as such a surprise because Toxicity is one of the best metal albums released in the past ten years. Steal This Album contains every bit as much passion and ferver as Toxicity and some of the songs are even better. Chic 'N Stu is incredibly catchy with some of the best lyrics, \\"advertising causes me therapy\\". Innervision easily could have been a Toxicity track, it's also the most radio friendly song on the album. Bubbles is one of the standout tracks and the lyrics \\"we're left with no arms in the power struggle...\\" will be indelibly tattooed in your brain after a few listens. A.D.D. and Pictures are the two strongest tracks on Steal this Album, and they do. A.D.D. flat out rocks and Serj totally takes over. Pictures has the most time changes and is the most complex song of the lot, it's also the most rewarding. System may not be the most conventional band around but they certainly have mastered their instruments. Serj is the modern day reincarnation of Jello Biafra with a much better vocal range. SOAD continue the fight where Rage Against The Machine left off and with such dead-on lyrics as \\"television is disgrace\\" lets hope Serj decides to stay up on the pulpit for awhile. Highly Recommended.
0066214122|4.0|A great read, one that I had to read until I fell asleep, and then pick up as soon as I awoke. Crichton draws the reader in and builds an amazing story, as always. This novel in particular doesn't feel like it was written as a screen play, and is all the better for it. That most of the novel takes place within a short time period adds to the tension and increases the pace. Character development is a little weak, but better than Crichton's usual. Some characters we think we know throughout the novel but only realize our error near the end. But Crichton's greatness lies more in his ability to take modern science- or soon-to-be modern science- and twist it just slightly, raising all the ethical and moral questions that surround the issues. It has been said that the best science fiction departs from reality only slightly. If this is so, Prey is truly quality writing. In the worst of worlds, one could see the book coming to life in another thirty years. But some words of warning: the descriptions of the deaths are really too gruesome and unnecessary. And the italicized blurb which is designed to get the reader to buy the book, just before the first chapter- it gives the ending away, making it obvious as to how the characters will respond to the trauma they face. Better not to read that till the end....
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I read somewhere that it was the X-Men that singlehandedly saved superhero films, and felt betrayed.<br />It was the original Blade (a dark horse if there ever was one) that proved the viability of the superhero film.  With it's tons of stylilzed action, blood, and Kung-Fu antics, it set the standard which other superhero films have been working to live up to.<br />Blade 2 is trendsetting in a similar (and check out the Director's commentary with Mr. del Toro and Peter Frankfurt.  These two guys are not only full of information, but they are hilarious!) manner.  The action is fast and furious, and the way computer graphics are used in some shots is remarkable.<br />Though, a pet peeve is that it doesn't make music an integral part of the proceedings like the original.  Instead it has a creepier, gothic vibe going for it for the most part.<br />And enough can't be said about the Reapers.  These guys are some of the creepiest characters to appear in film in a long time, and to see their gruesome faces are well worth the price of admission.<br />There are hints of a love story between Blade and the daughter of the leader of the Vampire Nation, but luckily there isn't too much time spend on developing this relationship because I personally thought that, considering the character of Blade, that the hints of a relationship between them seemed more logical that any actual relationship.
6304981635|5.0|This is one of the last films that Bruce Lee made, before his untimely death in July 20, 1973. \\"Enter the Dragon\\" is the first martial arts film to ever be shot by a Hollywood film studio, most notably Warner Bros., one of the greatest and most popular film studios of all time. This film shot Lee to international stardom and became one of the best groundbreaking martial arts epic in film history. This movie is about a man known as Lee, who works as an undercover agent working for Mr. Braithwaite. His mission is to attend a tournament, free the prisoners from the underground lab, and take down Han, the leader of the island which Lee is investigating in, and a traitor to the Shaolin Temple. There, Lee will meet other friends and allies like Williams (played by Jim Kelly), and Roper (played by John Saxon) who is known to bet for money everywhere he goes. This special edition DVD includes commentary by Bruce's wife, Linda Lee Cadwell, complete documentary on each character from the film, a brief history on Lee's films, a video documentary on Bruce Lee called \\"Bruce Lee In his own Words\\", a short video on Bruce Lee's backyard workout, and a biography of Jackie Chan, the heir to Bruce Lee's throne. Unlike some of Lee's films, which has basic violence and too much skipping on action sequences, Enter the Dragon is complete with explict violence, top-of-the-line martial arts action, and a riveting storyline. The sound effects to the film doesn't sound all that bad ! After all, it was 1973, right ? And the music sounds perfect and it fits the movie's atmosphere perfectly well. So in the end, Enter the Dragon is still, and always will be, a true masterpiece, and will continue to entertain Lee fans, old and new for years to come. A true must own for all fans of martial art films !
0880389052|5.0|This book could not have been put together any better. It starts very well and gets you into the characters right off the bat. The book moves at a great pace and really never slows  down. I must confess, I started with The Icewind Dale Trilogy and before starting book 2 I felt that I should read The Dark Elf Trilogy, I am so glad that I did. The characters are &quot;Awesome&quot; You get so in to Drizzt's family and hate them so much that you almost forget he is a drow although he acts nothing like his family.(other than Zak) What else can I say, I am a huge Toilkien fan and I have to say R.A. Salvatore in my opinion is right on track on becoming one of the great fantasy writers, If you haven't read this I suggest you start clicking on this website and get it shipped , once you read this book, you not only will be an R.A fan ..you will follow Drizzt in all his many tales ..very addictive, very entertaining, very very good.
B0000024RQ|5.0|This album was a cultural event.  It's a great and classic performance.  these are songs that impelled the civil rights and peace movements of the mid '60s, and they still have their power, and I might add, relevance, today.  Here Dylan presented not only the direct and didactic pleas of \\"Blowing in the Wind\\" but also the indictment of \\"Masters of War\\" and the prophetic Jeremiad of \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.\\"  Not to be discouraged by the threats of the war, the draft, and nuclear holocaust, Dylan could write an implicitly accusatory children's song celebrating Mississippi's culture in \\"Oxford Town.\\"   Or he could apply his satirical humor in talking blues and imaginative projections (not necessarily dreams or fantasies)--\\"Bob Dylan's Blues, \\"Bob Dylan's Dream,\\" \\"Talking World War III Blues.\\"  Dylan wasn't some moping loser sitting in a corner, dwelling with Weltschmertz, angst and self-abuse.  Here's a kid that could look at a world of pain and laugh (just to keep from cryin') and engage fully.  And while he was at it he could write romantically about haunting memories of the lost and abandoned love of a \\"Girl from the North Country,\\" the ubiquitous damsel met by a roving rambler.  The rambler is the kind of traveler we find in \\"Down the Highway.\\"  Dylan's poet could request reconciliation through the romping bravado of \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" or revisit the classic ballad \\"Corrina, Corrina.\\"  There are many houses in this mansion of American folk music.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Neil Young, Pet Sounds, Radiohead comparisons, none of them do this album justice. Although I agree with the fact that this album is disparate from previous Wilco albums, I strongly disagree with the opinion that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is not the band's best effort to date. The galloping, wistful pace of &quot;War on War,&quot; the sheer pathos aroused from &quot;Radio Cure,&quot; and the pop gem &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; are all prime examples of how this band has evolved sonically, lyrically, and most importantly, creatively.
B00007E8O5|5.0|If you're a fan of Alice In Chains, consider \\"Degradation Trip\\" a collection of 25 lost recordings that have finally seen the light.  But that assessment is also unfair because Cantrell's style has progressed beyond what Alice ever did.  The instrumental, \\"Hurts, Don't It?,\\" is a perfect example of how his style has changed.  Compared to his previous work, it would be like taking the depth of \\"Jar of Flies\\" and marrying it to the heaviness of \\"Dirt.\\"  If you're a fan of grunge and/or heavy metal, \\"Degradation Trip: Volumes 1 & 2\\" is highly recommended.

6300214753|5.0|Admit it, you have quoted Ferris Bueller on at least one occasion. This movie is packed with such hilarious one-liners it is hard not to. Ferris Bueller is a child of relative privelege who decides he would rather enjoy a great spring day then spend it trapped in school (who wouldn't?). He brings his best friend and girlfriend with him and they live it up for the day in Chicago, while their principal tries desperately to catch them. They lie their way into a super-fancy restaurant, take in a Cubbies game and dance and sing on a parade float. Meanwhile, rumors are flying around the school, each making Ferris closer to death than the last, which annoys his sister because she is stuck there.  There are a couple of anxious moments when they very nearly get caught, but never actually do. The characters are wonderfully created and acted, his parents are totally clueless, his sister is vindictive and Ben Stein is hilarious as the world's most boring history teacher. \\"Anyone, anyone?\\" And, of course, Matthew Broderick is charming as 'righteous dude' Ferris Bueller, the guy everyone wanted to be in high school.<br /><br />This movie is funny without being offensive and Matthew Broderick in the shower...what else do you need?
0670287059|5.0|I fell in love with this book reading it to my brother 20+ years ago and remember how excited he was to finally find Tom Thumb in all the pictures!  It's just as fun to read this with my young daughter, who likes to find the cat.  The illustrations in this book are so beautiful and important to the story, it's worth it to buy the hardcover (you miss lots of detail in the board book version).
B000002L1L|2.0|The Battle Rages On... and on, and for apparently no better reason than to have a 25th year reunion of Mark II.  Ritchie's heart really wasn't in this one, and if you read Ian Gillan's autobiography &quot;Child In Time&quot; that is made plain.  Much of this material falls flat, and rattles, rather than rages, on.  Gillan was forced to revamp some songs written with Joe Lynn Turner, as several songs were nearly completed with Turner for this album before he was sacked.  I hate to admit it, but Slaves and Masters had considerably more spunk than TBRO.  Standout tracks are &quot;Anya&quot; with a cool keyboard-harpsichord intro by Jon Lord and delicate acoustic playing from Ritchie, and &quot;Solitare,&quot; a moody, dark number.  Funny, both of these songs would have to be considered ballads and they're the best things here.  The rockers have no guts, from &quot;The Battle Rages On&quot; to &quot;Nasty Piece of Work,&quot; the driving force just isn't convincing.  It's apparent that there's dissension within the group, and things would be vastly improved on the Steve Morse fronted &quot;Purpendicular&quot; three years later.  You'd do yourself well to pick that release up instead.

The booklet<BR>includes all the lyrics to her 5 new tunes and all I can say for now is GET VOLUME TWO OUT!
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a very good movie. I have seen it two times. Josh Hartnett plays a really good part in it. It tells about the horrible failure of U.S. involvement in Somalia on 10/3/1998. It tells about how they got stuck there.All in all it was avery good movie. I want my mom to buy it for me, since I can't.
6302000823|5.0|I love this movie, I relate somewhat to it and to some of the events and emotions epicted in this film. There is a force as strong as a black hole's singularity here. I cannot stop my emotions from getting out when I watch this movie and I have watched it several times. There are many messages in this movie, but the ultimate message is that our childhood experiences are what makes us and direct us and we bring them with us to the end of our days. They shape our lives and the way we see the world, perhaps deep inside we never truly grow up and we take with us those moments of happiness and disappointment forever. I have to stop writing now.............
B000001ED1|5.0|I'm a big fan of girl rock; it's the only rock that I can stand. I bought this cd almost 10 years ago, and I probably hadn't listened to it in about 7 or 8 years. A few days ago however, something compelled me to listen to it, just because she was a female singer. I listened to it and...wow. What a great album. She's not a like the other girls that I listen to (Bif Naked, Veruca Salt, Garbage, Liz Phair, ect.) but it just makes me like her more! She's something new and fresh for me to listen to when I'm tired of Nina Gordan and Shirley Manson. Here's my summary of the songs--<br />St Teresa-GREAT song. It's absolutly beautiful. 5 stars.<br />Man In The Long Black Coat-Another great song. The lyrics are kind of spooky. 5 stars<br />Right Hand Man-This is a nice song...it's loud and crazy. 4 stars<br />Pensacola-Very good song. Again, the lyrics are sad and a little spooky. 5 stars<br />Dracula Moon-Good song. I think I would like it more if she did more singing and it wasn't as long. 4 stars.<br />One Of Us-Hum...the big popular song. It's nice, but I'm not a religious person so I don't really like the lyrics. But the music is nice. 4 stars<br />Ladder-Lovely song. The piano is great. 5 stars<br />Spider Web-I like this song; the lyrics are wonderful, maybe the best ones on the whole album. 4 stars<br />Let's Just Get Naked-I don't really like this song. It's slow and kind of boring. The lyrics get on my nerves too. 2 stars<br />Help Me-This is my least favorite song on the album. I skip it. 1 star, I guess just because Joan sings it..haha<br />Crazy Baby-This is a nice song, and the lyrics are kind of sad. I don't like the chorus as much as the rest of the song. 4 stars<br />Lumina-This is a very pretty song. I don't really understand it, but I don't think that that matters. 3 stars
B00005YW4H|4.0|As a progrock and classical music nut, I am PLEASED to report that atleast SOMETHING has come along to relieve our numb ears of 10 years of disillusionment in the music industry.<br />Most likely the immense success of this album (reaching #1!) has been something of an unpredicted fluke from left field, but... THANK GOD!!!! I absolutely give maximum respect to those with incredible musical sense that play the game and straddle the fine line between art and commercialism, in order to get their music out to the masses.  This album is pure mellow soul with jazz lacings and a rock subconsciusness.  Not a commercial sellout by any means, but a \\"crossover\\" (stupid term) success nonetheless.  Bottom line, this is the best new thing since Dream Theater.  Musically worlds apart, of course, but both made sure to only do what they were musically motivated to do, not compromising to the record company... and both happened to get many people to tune in.  All songs on this album are similar in atmosphere, yet within the atmosphere, there is subtle diversity that flows from track to track and concludes as it is meant to be, with a cover of a standard.  This girl has my support.<br />If like many people, you want to just take a breath and a time out from what the music industry keeps shoving down your throats and ears, buy this and come away with Norah.  Amen.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you like history or movies about war, this is a must see. Even if the aforementioned does not interest you, this is a must see. Band of Brothers is the most amazing, engrossing, and detailed piece on WWII I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. This is a mini-series, but it has the production value of a 100 million or more dollar feature length film. The attention to detail is staggering. Pay whatever your local Best Buy or Circuit City or Wal-Mart is asking, you must own this brilliant piece of work.
051788710X|5.0|After years of searching for answers (and failing to find any) in the myriad of dream books and dream dictionaries out there to explain to me what I was experiencing every night I put my head to my pillow, I finally found the key : Robert Moss's &quot;Conscious Dreaming&quot;.  Themes from the book that resonated for me: A dream is not  something to be dismissed as &quot;just a dream&quot;.  The universal archetypes are not necessarily applied to my dream-- the dreamer is the bottomline expert on what his or her dream means. We *do* go to other places, visit deceased loved ones, meet teachers, see past-present-future, receive information about our own health-----Moss validated for me what I was experiencing all along but was too afraid to acknowledge until his book reassured me that I was not the only one dreaming this way. &quot;Conscious Dreaming&quot; gave me simple tools and techniques to refine my process and keep track of my nightly travels. In practicing Moss's methods as outlined in this book (and the more advanced techniques in his others, &quot;Dreamgates&quot;, and &quot;Dreaming True&quot;) I have become so adept at dreaming that I have lead my own dreaming workshops based on these same techniques and have been able to lead many others to this fulfilling dream practice. It *is* a practice, and like any other fine art or sport you must exercise the muscles required regularly and it can take time to see the desired results. For me, reading &quot;Conscious Dreaming&quot; was all it took to unlock the mystery of my own dreaming. I highly recommend this book to any dreamer or anyone hoping to become one!
B00006ADFL|4.0|The last Peter Jackson film before he took on the monumental task of Lord of the Rings, Heavenly Creatures is a superb examination of the true story of two teenage girls who's friendship turns into a romance and its resulting deadly consequences in 1950's New Zealand.<br /> At the heart of the friendship lies the girl's common interest in fantasy. As evident through Jackson's other films, the director shows his similar interest by illustrating their fantasy world as they become closer. Strong macabre themes run through the film, as you simultaneously root for the girls? relationship and against what you know they eventually plan to do. Jackson skillfully balances this to create a mesmerizing film that you can't take your eyes off until the bloody end.<br />Acting all around is note perfect, especially with the two girls played by Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in her first film role. Everything works perfectly here to capture your attention. It?s clear how Jackson earned approval to make the risky Lord of the Rings project, because for the first time here, he shows how he can be a serious filmmaker with a load of talent.<br />Heavenly Creatures is a must-see film. Don't miss out on this mostly unknown film, it's one of those hidden jewels in the sea of bad films.
6305949980|5.0|Danny Elfman and Tim Burton are genius. This movie is probably my favorite all time movie, the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extra features. it has a some behind the stop motion animation type of things and also has 2 of Burton's earlier works: Vincent and Frankenweenie. Of coarse the movie itself is great also... no need to say that.
B0000000LI|5.0|Don't listen to this CD if you don't want to hear beautiful music. I will not nitpik the individual musicians because there is nothing to complain about. This CD sounds GREAT.
0553573403|5.0|Martin writes an engrossing tale by devoting each chapter to a hero or villian so you can see the world from that character's viewpoint. Each character is emotionally real and detailed and the events are realistic and gritty. Be forewarned, don't get too engrossed in any one character because he has no qualms about killing them off! The heroes and villians in this story are both capable of goodness and violence they seem so real that they make your imagination jump to new bounds. I've never read someone who can captivate me with writing like Martin and keep me wanting to read on until I'm so tired I have no choice but to put it down. Some of the best characters are the villians, like Sandor Clegane also called \\"The Hound\\". A former noble abused by his brothers violent temper and maimed for life with horrible burn scars on his face. Although he seems evil there is a deep sense of sadness and lack of love in this characters life. His frustration is evident and his good side although buried beneath so many years of abuse and ridicule, strives to reach the surface. You can see the tension and trauma this man has sustained, and through it all he still has a need to defend the weak and helpless. It's well worth the money for the book. I've read all three about four times already and I can't wait for the new one to arrive. All of my friends got hooked on the series after I told them about it. Probably the best books I've ever read. Nuff Said. Mike Ceranko
019431510X|5.0|I dont know why this book is not very popular inspite of being the best book to teach english in a simple manner. I used this dictionary during my GRE preparation and I found it very useful. I scored 700 on the verbal section (99%ile). I still have this book and use it first especially to see how the word is used in a sentence.<br />It wouldnot give you the origin of the word and other details of pronunciation, etc. But it would tell you the several meanings the word can have in a simple manner. More importantly it uses the word in a complete sentence. Doing so not only gives you the context but reinforces your memory. One problem with other dictionaries is that they give too long sentences (typically these sentences are popular or published in a newspaper). I hate those type of sentences. By the time you read the sentence you lose sight of what you are looking for. The sentences in this one are small sometimes just a short precise meaningful phrase.<br />I followed older edition. I saw the new edition and its even better. It has more pictures than the previous editions. Ofcourse if you want illustrated dictionary you shoudl go for the American Oxford Illustrated dictionary.<br />Grab this one right now if you are preparing for GRE or SAT. Also if you are looking for a dictionary which would give you meanings in a context then buy this dictionary.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|I heard so much ... this year, but the soundtrack to \\"8 Mile\\" is one of the few exceptions. One of the better rap soundtracks I've heard in awhile, not just because the first single, Eminem's \\"Lose Yourself\\", is one of most inspirational songs to come out this year (although it's played some 200 times already), \\"8 Mile\\" includes banger after banger by such MC's like his group D-12, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Nas, Gangstarr, and the legendary Rakim. Most of the 16 songs on the album are standouts: \\"8 Mile\\" (Eminem) is better than \\"Lose Yourself\\" (most of you would agree), \\"Rabbit Run\\" is another inspirational song, \\"Love Me\\" is kinda slow, but 50 Cent's verse shines on the track. Speaking of 50 Cent, he's got two of the best songs on the album, \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"Places To Go\\" (Memo to Ja Rule: You ... ..., ...!), I wasn't really feeling Obie Trice on \\"Love Me\\", but \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" is better: hot lyrics and a killer beat as well. Rap rivals Nas and Jay-Z both have songs on the album, though I personally think Jay-Z has gone a little too pop, \\"8 Miles And Runnin'\\" (featuring Freeway) is one of the better songs he did. Nas has a better track, though: \\"U Wanna Be Me\\". The beat is plain and simple, but the lyrics are outstanding, as always, I don't care if it has too much curse words in it. (This is a song I can personally relate to) \\"Battle\\" proves that Gangstarr can still make excellent tracks after a decade of existence, Xzibit's \\"Spit Shine\\" and Rakim's spelled-out self-titled track are also hot tracks (both produced by D-12's Denaun Porter), and D-12's \\"Rap Game\\" (featuring 50 Cent singing the chorus), Eminem's and Bizarre's verses stand out (though Bizarre's verse is funny as hell). Only thing is this: WHY THE HELL IS MACY GRAY IN HERE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! The song ..., it got on my nerves...as well as Young Zee's \\"That's My ... Fo' Real\\" and the Bookmat song \\"Wasting My Time\\" (some actors just can't sing for ..., just think J. Ho trying too hard to do so). Aside from those corny tracks, \\"8 Mile\\" is a perfect addition to your rap collection. It still gets 5 stars regardless.
0062502182|4.0|this book was ok. it was kind of corny in some parts, but it had a good plot and led you deep into your heart. it might, however, be a little too deep for some people.
B00006RIO7|5.0|When word first hit several years ago, about the Chicgo movie finally being made,after years of development, I was extatic! I was a great fan of the broadway show, and had seen it twice! The movie,(as most of you know, DOES NOT DISSAPOINT!)The movie was really wonderfully executed, and I think that it deserves all the praise (and more) that it has been recieveing! So when the soundtrack to this great movie came out, I decided to buy it, even though I already had the 1996 Broadway Cast Version (Which is amazing!)Well I gotta say that this soundtrack exceeded my expectations! Because not only did it have all the wonderfully sung tracks from the movie:<br />(most of the tracks on th c.d. are sung by Renee, Catherine, and Richard) But it also contains the wonderful score by Danny Elfman, a terrific song by Ms. Zeta-Jones, and Ms. Latifah , called &quot;CLASS&quot; which was in the Broadway Show, but was unfortunately cut from the final edit of the movie (I guess we'll have to wait for the DVD to see it!) and three other songs, one of them is a POP/Rap Remake (in the tradition of Moulin Rouge's Lady Marmalade remake) of the movie's song &quot;CELL BLOCK TANGO / HE HAD IT COMIN' &quot; sung by Queen Latifah, L'il Kim and Macy Gray. The 2nd &quot;bonus&quot; song is a very catchy song by Anastacia (whose voice I love!) called &quot;LOVE IS A CRIME.&quot; And the 3rd &quot;bonus&quot; song and the best surprise of the album is the song that rolled over the credits of the film: Written by the show's composers (Kaner &amp; Ebb) it' a great duet performd by Catherine and Renee called &quot;I MOVE ON.&quot; So even if you have any of the broadway versions of  CHICAGO, BUY THIS TRULY SPECTACULR CD! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED
B00007E8O5|5.0|This album is spectacular throughout.  The eleven songs not on the original release are, in my opinion, better than most of the ones that made the first cut.  You'll find some of the songs (&quot;Siddhartha&quot; and &quot;Pig Charmer&quot; most often for me) running through your head all the time.  &quot;31/32&quot; is a soft, emotional masterpiece, along the lines of &quot;Gone&quot; (also on here) and &quot;Hurt A Long Time&quot; (from Jerry's first CD, Boggy Depot).  &quot;Hurts Don't It?&quot; is an instrumental somewhat reminiscent of Alice's &quot;Whale &amp; Wasp&quot; except heavier, with no violins.<br />The bottom line is that I'm not sure that this isn't better than Alice.  Saying that feels sort of like a betrayal, since Alice has been my favorite band since '95, when Tripod (the self-titled CD) came out.  In any case, this is the best album to come out in at least the last five years, and it was worth all the three years or so that Jerry spent writing, recording, and trying to get it out there for us.
B00006DEFA|1.0|I'm usually not a big stickler for historical accuracy in movies, but Amadeus is outrageous for its slander of Salieri.  In fact, not only was he a consistent supporter and advocate for Mozart, he later provided patronage and assistance for three young men named Beethoven, Schubert and Liszt.  Just about the only thing Salieri is remembered for in the history books is his astounding generosity and enjoyment of competition.  Depicting Salieri as homicidal with jealousy is rather like making a movie in which Abraham Lincoln buys Frederic Douglass and makes him his house slave.
0884271153|5.0|This book is about common sense. This book is the second &quot;Must Read&quot; for Industrial engineers and MBA students in the Eliyahu Goldratt books.<BR>It talks about the possibilities of the state of the art distribution networks to lead to new marketing solutions. Although this book talks about marketing solutions but it is targeted for managers coming out of manufacturing toward upper level management. Some of the solutions are common sense, but the problem it reflect a lot of the problems in the outside world, were commonsense is not common any more. <BR>I recommend reading this book after reading &quot;The Goal&quot;.
0345363132|5.0|against which I measure all other novels - historical or otherwise. Sounds odd, but I felt honored to be able to read it. Nothing else has quite met the challenge, but if I even pause to make the conscious comparison, I know the new book is amazing; for example Pressfield's Gates of Fire had me thinking, &quot;Wow - not Sunne in Splendor, but in the top 2 or 3 behind it.&quot; This is an exquisitely written tapestry of time, place, character, love and conflict, and of course, tragedy; knowing how Richard III has been tarred by the victors made closing the book more poignant - and this is a book you'll wish you never had to finish. To me, it is the perfect example of scrupulous historical detail put brilliantly in service to a great story. A book that stays with you for months; years.  Wonderful.
B00004U60I|5.0|While Baby Bach is not captivating to me, it keeps my 10 month old entertained the whole way through.  But it isn't meant for mothers it is meant for infants and toddlers as it says in the editorial review.  If you are looking for something for the baby that constantly needs entertained I would recommend giving it a try.  If it doesnt work, sorry, every baby is different!<BR>By the way, these videos were composed in a basement on a low budget until Disney bought it, that may explain the BRIEF use of her own children in the videos.
B000000OTU|5.0|The first I'd heard Aerosmith and knew it was them was at MGM Studios in Disneyworld Orlando. The &quot;Rockin' Roller Coaster&quot; was awsome with a large speaker beside each of your ear blasting &quot;Dude Looks Like A Lady&quot; while going through corkscrews and 0 - 60 mph(in 2 seconds) accelerations!<br />Anyways, Big Ones is a fine piece of work. It's nice and long and most of the songs I'd heard on the radio before buying it.<br />The songs that go in the A-grade category are: Love In An Elevator, Rag Doll, Dude (Looks Like A Lady), Janie's Got A Gun (you've gotta love the &quot;Run away, runaway from the pain&quot; part), Cryin', Amazing, and Livin' On The Edge.<br />The songs that go in the B-grade category are: Walk On Water (in my opinion, this is the best of the two new songs), What It Takes, Deuces Are Wild, The Other Side, Crazy, and Angel)<br />Blind Man goes into my C, maybe C+ category. I usually skip this one, but you may like it. <br />And then there's Eat The Rich...A++. Very good stuff. This CD is really well done and I like how it goes from a couple fast songs, to a couple mellow/ballad songs, than to some more energetic, and you get the picture.
0440180295|4.0|Vonnegut once again introduces an audience to a zany world full of colorful characters and situations. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut gives a detailed description of Billy Pilgrim and the events he encounters throughout his life, as well the  philosophical influence that he gains from writer Kilgore Trout (a character that Vonnegut uses in other books, Breakfast of Champions). Overall, I thought this was an excellent book. I love the way that Vonnegut writes; beginning with a story, then preceeding with a different one, and connect the two later on in the novel. I highly recommend this book.
6303979882|5.0|This is just simply an absolutely delightful film about girls coming of age in the 70's. Four twelve year old girls share a friendship that no one could predict would still be alive and well years later, despite distance and time. A pact made at age twelve is due, and all four girls must keep the pact. Because, after all, a promise IS a promise.
B0000029DD|5.0|If you are the kind of person who goes out and buys an album simply because it has one good song on it this album is not for you. This album is for somebody who has the ability to appreciate an entire album. Grace is from start to finish an extremely wonderful listening experience.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Well, being only 18 i figured 'Hey, i know about a third to a half of these songs, so i bet i know the rest' (i'd done the same thing with Billy Joel a few years prior and he's since entered my top 5 favorite artists of all time).  I turned out to know about half of the songs i 'didn't know'- believe me, aside from the obvious 'Tiny Dancer' 'Rocket Man' 'Candle In The Wind' 'Bennie And The Jets' and the disney songs, odds are that you DO know 'Levon' 'philadelphia freedom' 'someone saved my life tonight' 'island girl' 'believe' 'honky cat' and others- but just didn't know it.  And the ones you still don't know after you've listened through it all?  There's a reason they're included.
0553381709|2.0|As many past and future readers will no doubt discover in the third installment of the Song of Ice and Fire series, George R.R. Martin doesn't feel the need to spare the reader from the more gruesome details of his imagination. By now one would feel accustomed to his violent and immoral world, perhaps even slightly at home. But here, in \\"A Storm of Swords\\", Martin reveals that the grittiest facets of his story have yet to be seen.<BR>Sadly, this is both a blessing, and an immobilizing curse. For so many readers Martin's first work in this series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was a breath of fresh air. They key to this respectful status was in two things: 1, Martin didn't dabble in Dungeons and Dragons, he dabbled in political betrayal, and 2, no character, no matter how beloved, was able to cheat death. <BR>Major characters and well-loved faces didn't hold immortality; kings could die just as easily (if not more so) then soldiers on the battlefield. In short, get too attached to a particular character and you just might find their quick and grim departure to be nothing less then traumatic. <BR>Quirky and brilliant as it was, it was also held within a deep tapestry of political innuendo. Certain groups, factions and Great Houses held stakes towards claiming a right to the throne of a kingdom. To ensure that their interests always remained on top, any means were taken. Yes, even murder, was exacted. This created many beloved characters in Martin's staple, characters who shared their beds with assassination and maneuvering. However, it also spawned characters that intertwined themselves with honor and duty. <BR>And, as I mentioned, you were never sure as to who would experience the downfall of their choices. But in \\"A Storm of Swords\\", Martin seems to have taken his exploration of unforeseen occurrence to the limits of its power. It's as if the reader has finally woken up from the trance of bliss to discover that it isn't Shakespeare he's reading, but rather literary-trash. <br/>Enjoyable trash at first, but trash, none the less. <BR>Plotlines and character developments are created and destroyed so fast that you barely feel he's telling the reader a grander story. What was once a well-crafted and witty tale of politicians and magicians has degraded into Fantasy-Soap Opera. In this sense, the book's title, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is fitting. Few survive the bloody torrent this book presents, and when the aftermath hits, the reader is left wondering, \\"How can he expand this into 3 more books?\\" <br />Yet, it would be ignorant to believe that a skilled writer such as Martin would deprave himself of an opening by which he could continue his story. The question isn't how he will continue it, but rather if readers will stand by to watch him march onward (or rather, downward). But even amongst the over-hyped chaos of his series, Martin still retains much of his crafty word play and flair for the dramatics. (Can anyone truly sandblast him for managing to escape the all-engulfing shadow projected by Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings?)<BR> He even takes the time to introduce us to fantastic new characters and Houses. (Keep an eye out for the charismatic Dornish and their crazed princes). For that matter, he even reintroduces characters that played a small roll in the first book, to play a larger role in this one. More then one fan will cheer at the return of Lord Tywin Lannister, I'm sure. But a fair warning to the reader at hand: The new characters, as delightful as they may seem, come and go...some of them more violently then others. <BR>Also welcome is Martin's slow, but meaningful introduction of mystical powers. Through all of the political maneuvering and grabs for power, you always feel the dark undertone that some grander force lies in waiting. Perhaps that's where Martin means to take the series, perhaps not. It's difficult to say when Martin embellishes the liberty to continue his onslaught of sex, violence and all things disturbing. <br />Great aspects aside \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is simply Fantasy-sensationalism, not timely literature. Martin's dramatics and depraved characters may very well be lost if he's forsaken a story-arc in the name of shock-value. It's as if he's promised to take his readers to Mars, but instead simply painted the moon red and called it Mars. <BR>Ultimately, in this analogy we see the largest and most unspoken difference between him and Tolkien: Martin promises to take his readers to Mars, Tolkien truly did.
B00007E8V4|5.0|The music in this album is amazing.  The musicianship is unbelievable in this album, as with all their others.  They can really rock some times, but the way they can actually mellow out and jam is awesome.  And that's all in one song.  I especially like John Dolmayan's ability in this album.  His best songs are Innervision and Mr. Jack, the greatest song on this CD.  If you are a drummer I suggest picking this one up.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I own all four recordings of Chicago -- original, film version, B-way revival, and London.  And I like them most to least in that order.  <br />The movie soundtrack is fantastic, but it falls just a little short of the original 1975 Broadway recording for several reasons.  Gwen Verdon created a more quirky and genuinely funny Roxie, and that comes across in her interpretation of the songs (esp. the spoken part of &quot;Roxie&quot;).  Although Renee gave Roxie more depth and substance, which was essential for the film, Gwen is a better interpreter of the songs.<br />Chita Rivera created a splashier and more flamboyant Velma, whereas Catherine Z-J's Velma is more menacing and intimidating.  Catherine is so impressive musically that I think it's a toss up.  However, Chita (and Gwen, who died last year) were already 20 year veterans of Broadway by 1975, and all of that experience and skill comes across in the &quot;seen it all, done it all&quot; characters they play.   <br />Jerry Orbach (now on law &amp; Order) is a far better musical performer than Richard Gere, and sings the songs with less kitsch and cheekiness. I found this really annoying in Gere's musical performance -- I think he was trying to cover up an average singing ability by adding in a bunch of odd ticks and mannerisms (...the flat Irish accent, the Al Jolson-ish delivery).  <br />The stage versions also have a fun twist: Mary Sunshine is played by a man in drag, and &quot;she&quot; squeaks out a ridiculously optimistic and high-pitched aria about goodness and kindness -- as all the conniving backstabbers that surround her roll their eyes.  There's also &quot;When Velma Takes The Stand&quot; (dropped from the film), a great song about Velma's ideas for her courtroom dramatics, which Roxie eventually steals. I also prefer the Merry Murderesses of the original because they tell their stories in &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; more naturally with humor and individual character.<br />One plus for the movie version: the musical arrangements deliver more punch and complexity.<br />I recommend buying both the original and the movie soundtracks.
B00000JPH6|1.0|I viewed this movie with the camp program I work at.  The children there are ages 5-11.  Well, not only did I not enjoy it, but the children didn't either.  Maybe 5 kids, out of the 30 actually watched it.  I tried to watch it, and after 5 minutes, I was bored of it.  I found it hard to sit still and watch it.  There was absolutley no point to the movie, and the complex script, made it hard to understand, not only for children, but for adults as well.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless if you like stories that are extremley fantasy, and make no sense.
B00006AG9F|5.0|With this album I meet the band and I loved it. Immediately I bought the L.P. and the Vigilante too. There was certain magic in the sound of this album, with brilliance and very good sound achieved because all of it was recorded originally in Metal-based tape. The sound in the LP was deep, clear, with good achieved bass and very bright. Real good for its era (even tough I bought the Polygram Mexican Pressing of this album, and Polygram Mexico didn't did good jobs pressing LPs)...<br /><br />Now, in de CD era, I found this album and, in its first incarnation, lost many of its great sound. But with this remastered edition, it recovered much of what the LP offered at its time: The warmth of the sound, the deep bass, and the clarity... Not all of the LP, but very well achieved in the end. Really, it worths each penny paid for it.<br /><br />I own all the Magnum records and this is my preferred, followed by the \\"Kingdom of Madness\\" album. If you want to know the essence of Magnum at the time, you must hear this album, \\"Kingdom of Madness\\" or \\"Magnum II\\" albums. The sound of Magnum in the eighties is very different of what is offering nowadays. Magnum is adapting to each era, and never sounds out-of-time. But, in that days, maybe these three albums settled the best of Magnum, although I really like almost all their music.
B00006RIO7|5.0|When I heard that they were making a Chicago movie, I didn't know what to think. After recently seeing the musical at a local theater I just didn't understand how they could do it. But in the end they did a good job with keeping the essence of the musical while telling a more theatrical story. I was very impressed with the acting and the whole look of it. But that's not what I came here to talk about. I came here to talk about the music.<br />There's no doubt about it, Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays the sexy murderess Velma, proves her vocal talent from the first line of \\"And All That Jazz.\\" And she'd not the only one who can sing. The cast features other singers experienced in Broadway such as Richard Gere, who plays the scheming lawyer Billy Flynn, John. C. Reilly, who plays the adorable Amos Hart, and Taye Diggs of Rent fame who plays the bandleader. Rene Zellweger was a more surprising choice but she really proves herself with her sweet voice that fits wonderfully with such numbers as \\"Funny Honey,\\" \\"Roxie\\" and many others. Richard Gere, someone who I would have never pictured for the part of Billy Flynn, plays the part perfectly and proves that he has an impressive voice in such songs as \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" and \\"All I Care about is Love.\\" A couple of other well cast parts are R&B and rap star Queen Latifa who plays the part of Momma Matron better than anyone I've seen and John C. Reilly, a very under appreciated actor with a great voice.<br />If you saw and enjoyed the movie you'll be happy to see a couple extra tracks. Some of them are worth your time. Some aren't. First there's the song Class, which was cut from the final draft of the movie but still a funny song to listen to. Then there's the song \\"I move on\\" which appears in the credits. It's the only song sung by Zeta-Jones and Zellweger that wasn't in the original musical. The two instrumental pieces by Danny Elfman are just great, as usual. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the two pop tunes added on in theend. They just seem strange on an album with mostly Broadway stuff on it. And also, they aren't too good. Beyond that the CD is great. A couple of my favorites are the \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and \\"Mister Cellophane.\\" I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I actually had a hard time chooseing between 4 and 5 stars but in the end I figured the 16 great tracks can make up for the 2 short bad ones. It's one of my new favorite CDs.
B00005AAFT|2.0|I am a big Rammstein fan, but i ordered this cd over 3 months ago and it still hasn't arrived.  If I wanted to buy this cd, i would just go to the store to purchase it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|AWESOME, SPELLBINDING, DEEP, SOOOOO DEEP!<br />Christina Aguilera's 2nd album \\"Stripped\\" is truly amazing!  She gives it her all on this album.  All that she is displayed without pretense.  She shines and I Love It!  A true breath of musical fresh air, it has color, texture, and variety.<br />Better than Whitney Houston, better than Mariah Carey, better than Faith Hill, and better than Shania Twain, this is truly a 'From the Soul' album; one of the best of 2002.<br />Urban MUSIC LOVERS, you'll wanna hear a whole lot more of this.  <br />Trust Me!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|The 2 Russian teenagers of T.A.T.U. could well be on their way to being the music industrys biggest new stars. Its evident that these girls have all the makings of superstardom on their debut album which spawns the incredible first single All The Things She Said. This song is nothing like I have ever heard. The girlish vocals, engaging chorus, and hard driving beats make this song sensational. Proving they are not going to be one hit wonders, the girls score with the dance club anthem Show Me Love and their haunting cover of the Smiths How Soon is Now ( theme song for Charmed fans). From start to finish their is not one bad song on here. Crank it up and enjoy!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought a few cd's after Christmas that I wanted and didn't get.  There were a few I assumed I'd love, and didn't like (for instance, the new JLo..avoid that cd like the plague!)  This was one that I thought \\"well, if it stinks, no biggie\\"...and as it turns out?  It's my new favorite cd!!  Christina, despite what people are thinking of her new persona, has an amazing voice and is a true musical talent.  This cd has so many styles....she covers hip hop, rock, Latin, love songs....and does EACH of them with amazing skill!!  I've only owned it a couple weeks, and I've listened to it every single day at work, and every time I listen, I end up bopping around my office with way more enthusiasm than I started with at the beginning of the day.  Her voice and drive are infectious!!<br />Christina....thanks for a GREAT cd!!
0790732203|5.0|I may be the only one in the nothern hemisphere not to have seen this one until today.... I picked this one out just for the fun of seeing a movie that everybody had seen twelve times and that features a was-he-ever-that-young? Tom Cruise. <BR>What a surprise ! While I was waiting at best for yet another spoiled movie about rich kids in suburbian Chicago, I just had discovered the film that summarized the whole 80's ! The screenplay has to be one of the most brilliant I had even seen, and the subtext is as ambiguous and subversive that I have ever seen one. <BR>The story epitomized the whole money-grabbing, sex-addicted 80's era, probably even anticipating on the evolution of this era. It is absolutely essential that movies can be read on different levels. This one figures a nice kids-fool-parents first level, but on the second level, the movie tells us about how the failure of the american dream and how it is now summarized by Sex, Money and Sex gets Money values. <BR>The money could be seen as a ground for other movies like American Beauty to build on as it laid down the basis of the suburbian life crisis in a way few movies had made before. <BR>One liners like \\"Trust is a four letter word\\" are priceless and play again twenty years after. <BR>An essential movie.
B000002L9B|5.0|Me and a few other die hard Prince fans always argue about which soundtrack is better, Purple Rain or Under the Cherry Moon. Cherry Moon is slightly better. The first 4 songs grip you and take you through a ride of changing speeds before Prince hits you with the funky and groovy track, \\"Girls and Boys\\" then he keeps you dancing with \\"Life Can be So Nice\\". Every song on this album is great. This is a must for all Prince fans. If you can get your hands on a copy of \\"Love or Money\\", the B side of \\"Kiss\\" then I would buy that too. Enuff said, buy the album.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones, who I believe is Ravi Shankar's daughter, has one of<BR>the most beautiful voices I have heard in a long time, and she makes it seem so easy to sing like she does!  When I put this CD on, I have to listen to the whole thing, because it's that good- She is definitely headed for great things in the music world! I highly recommend any of her CDs of the two that I have heard!
B00000HZFH|5.0|I thought Perfect From Now On was their best album... until I listened to this.  Although these songs are more &quot;radio friendly&quot; sounding, that does nothing to degrade the greatness of the album.  The hooks are very catchy, such as in Bad Light and Time Trap, but they are still very deep and satisfying songs.  Very very very highly recommended.
0783231032|3.0|Follwing the one-two hits of JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, 1941 is a rare Spielberg dissapointment compared to his best work. Not to say that the film dosn't have it's moments, but the sum of it's parts works better than the movie as a whole. As Spielberg protege said: &quot;Steven's direction was brilliant, the idea was terrible.&quot; Which pretty much sums up the whole film. But repeated viewings of this rather haphazard comedy shows that there are some clever comedic set-pieces, the film rests squarley on large-scale effects and screaming comedy, which is hardly cohesive. Dan Akroyd is good, as are the rest of the cast including John Belushi, Christopher Lee, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Stack, John Candy and Treat Williams. But the impressive cast gets swamped by the overly-loud visuals. This is also the one time when John Williams' brass, strident score hampers the film by making it even louder. Highlights include Wild Bill Kelso (Belushi)'s anitcs, the audacious attack on the amusement park and a large Ferris wheel falling into the sea. It's actually not as bad as what critics thought when the film had it's uncertain release in 1979, but not that good when compared to his best work. An interesting curio for fans, but it lacks the classic Spielberg touch that his previous efforts have.
B000002UQJ|5.0|This album doesn't seem to get the credit I think it deserves. I will admit that the song selection is pretty uneven, but the songs that are good are REALLY good, which I feel makes up for the weaker tracks.<BR>The title track is a nice, slow rocker and one of my favorites. This is a Paul McCartney classic that never was, in my opinion. \\"Looking For Changes\\" is a great early-90's rock'n'roll song that exhibits Paul's rarely-seen angry side. \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\" is not one of my favorites but is apparently one of Paul's since he released it as the first single from this album. Not a good representation of the rest of the material... \\"Mistress & Maid,\\" along with \\"The Lovers That Never Were,\\" is a leftover from his writing collaboration with Elvis Costello. Both songs have somewhat shakey arrangements and are the two weakest tracks, if you ask me. \\"I Owe It All To You\\" is magical. \\"Biker Like An Icon\\" has a nice groove to it, as does \\"Peace In The Neighbourhood.\\" \\"Golden Earth Girl\\" is a standard McCartney piano ballad. To me, it comes out sounding like a mixture of \\"Wanderlust\\" and a church hymn--not very groundbreaking but still good (it's a Paul McCartney ballad--how can it not be good?). \\"Get Out Of My Way\\" sounds a little bit like a Beatles-esque song, but it's nothing special. It features some cute lyrics, though. \\"Winedark Open Sea\\" is a great ballad, though it goes on a bit long, like a few other songs from this album. The end of the song is great, but it's the part between the bulk of the song and the end that seems repetitive. \\"C'mon People\\" is a nice last track, but except for that fact, it's honestly nothing too special. \\"Cosmically Conscious,\\" the not-so-secret song, features Paul playing some unusual instruments, such as a sitar and an ocarina.<BR>There are better Paul McCartney albums to get, but one should certainly not overlook Off The Ground.
B000002LUB|5.0|After many years of Black Sabbath playing in tiny clubs and making big hair pop metal music they decided to beg Ronnie James Dio to return to their band.  Ronnie had just ended his successful arena tour for the Lock up the wolves cd. <br />Indeed The Voice of Metal himself Ronnie James Dio returned to black sabbath to create some awesome music.  Ronnie James Dio is not only an amazing vocalist but he is also a composer.  He does not just sit back and let everybody else create the music.  Ronnie gets very involved and also writes the lyrics.  <br />Dehumanizer is an incredibly heavy and hostile record.  Ronnie's voice is a power house, full of soul and aggression.  He roars his way from Computer God through Buried Alive.  <br />Dehumanizer will please the 70s era Black Sabbath fans.  This CD has the bluesy guitar solos, and booming bass lines.  Songs such as After all the dead and letters from earth are crushing doom metal classics.  Most of the songs have that 70s era feel to it and although you may think that Ronnie James Dio is a bossy control freak.  You have it wrong, Black Sabbath have returned to their classic heavy doom sound and have remained a stone monument with Ronnie roaring on vocals.  <br />Some of these songs may even impress the younger generation of people whom are most interested in Rage against the machine.  Tony Iommi whips out those pounding riffs on Dehumanizer that will please true metal fans' ears.
0066214122|5.0|I read at least a book a week, so it takes a bit to surprise me anymore....This was all I'd hoped it would be--and likely an amazing insight into some scientific fields that don't get as much media time as they should. A truly scary scenario, backed up with great characters, plotline, and twists. A VERY enjoyable read.
B000069CWE|1.0|Just a remixe of their already ... Hybrid Theory to pump their fans for more cash. This isn't rock, so don't waste your money and make yourslef [money] richer.
B000069HK2|4.0|Whoever the 5th review down from me is, well, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Selling out is when people change there music just to suit other people, and The Used only has one CD, and they obviously have not done that since they only have one CD out. I rate this CD a 4 because during some songs they could lighten up on the screaming, but the rest makes up a very good album and is well put together. You can definetaly expect good things in upcoming albums from this band.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Just see the movie and hear the soundtrack. That is all I can say. The whole experience is so perfect and so wonderful - I cannot put it into words!
B0000640VO|4.0|I bought this DVD without seeing according to the reviews on this site and was not disappointed in the least!  This movie made me feel so WARM INSIDE.  It was excellent and the cinematography was beautiful. Audrey Tatou is mesmerizing. I have watched it so many times and upon my first viewing was a bit dismayed by having to read subtitles... (so I'm lazy) but they were'nt hard to follow at all. I've watched it so many times since then I am actually learning French. Albeit, the phrases are currently limited to certain subject matter as suicidal fish....<br />I recommend this movie to EVERYONE!
B000024D4R|5.0|With its absurdly long songs (&quot;Dogs,&quot; for instance, goes past seventeen minutes), &quot;Animals&quot; had virtually no chance of becoming a radio standard like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or &quot;The Wall.&quot;  That's too bad, because I think this album surpasses its better-selling counterparts.  &quot;Animals&quot; is, simply put, a masterpiece of musicianship and songwriting.  The into/outro combination of &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; bookends three ten-plus minute epics, &quot;Dogs,&quot; &quot;Pigs,&quot; and &quot;Sheep.&quot;  With insinuating melodies, hair-raising guitar solos, and beautiful synths interwoven into the mix, Pink Floyd created an ambient sound that was intricate and soothing at the same time.  Perhaps most importantly, Roger Waters delivered a vocal performance for the ages, with a texture that reflected the depth of the album's lyrics.  Waters's delivery here is understated, but at that same time it's charged with emotion and indignation.  With Waters and every musician in top form, &quot;Animals&quot; is an excellent album in every way, and it deserves even more than the considerable amount of attention that it's gotten.
0375500901|3.0|After having read Silva's first book (\\"The Unlikely Spy\\") I thought I had found a great new talent in the action/thriller genre.  But if \\"The Kill Artist\\" is any indication I think Silva has lost his touch.<br />His writing style is still very good, but the plot of this novel reads like something out of a guide to writing a best-seller.  \\"Unlikely Spy\\" was much more sophisticated than this.<br />Because the style doesn't match the simplicity of the plot I'm giving the book three stars.
B00005JKJA|5.0|One thing is for certain - when you watch something done by David Lynch, you'd better pay attention!  This movie inverts the protagonists-try-to-unravel-the-mystery cliche to present a story wherein the mystery/fantasy slowly dissolves into the real story, and the central characters are not revealed to us until the movie's final half-hour.  Still, this remains an enigmatic experience that disturbs and provokes, as Lynch's films always do.  Also, great performances all around.
B00007L4OM|3.0|Wasabi is a very popular green-colored Japanese condiment served with sushi or sashimi, and those who love Japanese food must know its pungent taste.  The film takes its title from this wasabi paste (which Jean Reno actually tastes in this film), suggesting the content is sharp and spicy.<br />Jean Reno is a marverick French cop Hubert, whose way of arresting the criminals are so outrageous that he is suspended from the job by the disgruntled police chief.  But when a detective like him uses a weapon like fists faster than Jackie Chan's, and golf clubs, who can really hate him?  And, hey, he seems to be having a dinner tonight with no other than ever gorgeous ex-Bond girl Carole Bouquet (who appears as a cameo), Hubert has nothing to complain of. <br />But he left a very bitter memory in Japan, which he could never shake off.  And Hubert receives a ring from a lawyer telling him that his former Japanese girl-friend is dead.  But the news do not end here; it turns out that she left a daughter Yumi, and appointed Hubert as her guardian in her will.  Then Hubert flies to Japan, meets his daughter without telling the truth, but soon he finds that Japanese yakuza gangsters are aiming at Yumi for the unknown reasons.<br />OK.  The script of Luc Besson (who also produced through his film company Europa) is as thin as you can imagine, and the tone of the film is very light.  There are many actions (including that of using games and ... er ... golf balls), but the charm of the film largely comes from understated humor of Jean Reno as laconic Hubert.  He is not as cool as the assassin in \\"The Professional\\" (aka \\"Leon\\"); his relations with Yumi is not as convincing as the one with Natalie Portman.  Still, the ride goes pleasantly.  The film is good as pure entertainment.<br />Some informantion about the production.  Besson obviously made \\"Wasabi\\" in French and Japanese film market in mind, and he decided to use fully the potentials.  So, French actor Jean Reno is called in, who is very popular in Japan (far more popular in Japan than in USA or UK, I can say) while Japanese popular actress Ryoko Hiroshue is cast as Yumi as his daughter.  The director is Gerard Krawczyk, whose previous action-comedy \\"TAXI 2\\" was a huge hit in France (more than 10 millions came to the theatre in France, where the population is much smaller than in USA).  So, you may call \\"Wasabi\\" a unashamed result of market research, or \\"product.\\"  But it is defenitely better to see good product than to watch awful art, isn't it? <br />The film is mostly shot in Japan.  You can watch briefly a temple of Kyoto (Kiyomizu Temple) and the streets of Tokyo, and will have a glimpse (just a glimpse) of how teenagers are having fun in this city (such as \\"game center\\" as we call it in downtown of Shibuya) though the film is fast enough not to indulge in showing these scenes.  The film's location is not as exotic as the title implies, and its camera always focuses on the two leads, both of whom are great.  I don't tell you much about super-cool Reno except that he is as good as before, and he shouldn't have been in \\"Rollerball.\\"  About Hirosue, you may feel that her costumes and behaviors are too spanky for a Japanese girl.  In fact, some of her costumes, I admit, look too cartoon-ish, directly from Powerpuff Girls, but they are all intentional.  And as a teacher in college in Japan, I can tell that her dresses are exaggerated, but not so exceptional in downtown Tokyo.  And her frequent use of cell phone is nothing unusual among Japanese teenage girls.<br />\\"Wasabi\\" is too light-weight, it is true, but it gives fun certainly.  Just don't think.  Enjoy yourself and that's all you have to do.
B00006IR5S|2.0|Chamber of Secrets didn't really live up to my expectations. But then again I shouldn't have expected anything really. Most of the music is practically the same as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. After listening to the CD, I didn't have any music stuck in my head like John Williams usually can make. There aren't any really exciting parts, and even if there were, they were the same as the Sorcerer's stone.<br />Buy this CD if you want to collect all the Harry Potter soundtracks. But if you haven't heard the first one, buy that instead.
B000002UHG|5.0|O CD &quot;Broken China&quot;, do ex-teclista dos Pink Floyd, editado em 1996, no  mais do que o outro disco. <BR>O disco, que em meu entender, destapa do lado menos iluminado de uma banda como os Pink Floyd, algum fundamental, que coexiste ocultado por essa enfraquecedoura grandeza colectiva. <BR> um disco onde me surge como ideia central uma paragem necessria de uma rotina; uma paragem que permita repensar o percurso feito at esse mesmo ponto. <BR>A necessidade deste acto de introspeco, advm de uma daquelas vontades que nos sujem sem que para isso arranjemos uma explicao s por si suficiente. <BR>Todo este processo est representado num mergulho num ambiente purificador que no difere muito do ambiente subaqutico, onde o silncio, a ausncia de rudos, me parece ideal para nos escutarmos melhor, uma vez que dentro de gua os rudos acabam por ser no mnimo diferentes. E mesmo a prpria ideia de mergulhar na gua transmite-me a ideia de uma certa forma de libertao. <BR>O autor da msica do disco molda esse ambiente, que se pode reconhecer como fruto da vivncia Floydiana, algo psicadlico e que me leva a aceitar esta minha viso de mergulho purificador como aceitvel. <BR>So 16 temas que fazem o todo de que  esta obra, que o seu autor destina: <BR>&quot;To all those brave enough to face their past.&quot; <BR>Dedicatria algo provocante mas muito correcta, uma vez que para se enfrentar o passado h que faz-lo individualmente, e isso implica o isolamento social, que como se sabe abafa fortemente os problemas individuais de cada um dos seus elementos. Mas este acto de enfrentar o passado, a meu ver  mais profundo do que  primeira vista pode aparecer,  uma paragem que acaba por resultar num reencontro profundo com aquele que, por falta de se encontrar, parou. <BR>Deixo a minha percepo de algumas faixas: <BR>&quot;Breaking Water&quot;, a primeira msica do disco, leva-me perto do stio que julgo fundamental para compreender o que quero explicar: OPrincpio; j no disco que Mike Oldfiel criou inspirado no livro &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot;, encontro essa harmonia de comeo. <BR>Algo que sendo muito simples, apaga os rudos residuais, que pertinentes, custam muito a abandonar a pacincia que o Homem tem, para o que recebe do mundo atravs dos ouvidos. <BR>Pacincia esta necessria para receber outros estmulos. <BR>A msica de &quot;Night of Thousand Furry Toys&quot;, segura a ideia que a letra de Anthony Moore transmite de um novo mundo que no nos pode ser de todo, assim to estranho. <BR> esta dupla quem nos apresenta: &quot;Hidden Fear&quot;, que nos fala disso mesmo, de dores de adultos. Dores, ou medos recalcados ou escondidos, necessrios para que as crianas passem a adultos: crianas que mantm na solido tudo o que sempre nos fica por compreender. <BR>A corrida flui como nos passam os dias quando no sobra tempo, ou no se possui conhecimento capaz para conceber toda a novidade que espreita e aparece to rapidamente, com o nosso contacto com o mundo exterior: o fascnio, ou a pacfica contemplao da novidade em &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Unfair Ground&quot; e &quot;Satellite&quot;. <BR>Em &quot;Woman of Custom&quot; est explicita a mudana, para uma necessria construo de caracter. <BR>Este tema  muito bonito porque a fraca voz de Rick Wrigth contrasta com a enorme fora das palavras que canta. <BR>&quot;Interlude&quot; apresenta em conjunto com &quot;&quot;Black Cloud&quot; uma qualquer nova fase. <BR> um desarmnico rudo que se limpa perfeitamente em &quot;Far from the Harbour Wall&quot;. <BR> a imagem da desorientao de quem j no  amado, resulta num mergulho, num ambiente algo aqutico no tema &quot;Drownig&quot;. <BR>Depois vem a voz quente de Sinead O'Connor colorir com a luz familiar de uma qualquer balada clssica do &quot;The Wall&quot;, (esse tal mergulho que mais no  seno a representao do reencontro de quem provavelmente j est a comear a perceber o gozo que dencontrar-se de novo, aps esse inevitvel afastamento individual para manter uma relao amorosa entre duas pessoas) na cano &quot;Reaching for the Rail&quot;. <BR>Em &quot;Blue Room in Venice&quot; acontece um frustrado procurar fsico da ideia que  amar-se algum. <BR> a revelao de algum que por j ter amado, cai na loucura, no desespero de no possuir objecto que lhe realize a vontade. <BR>Vejo neste disco um pacfico e curioso olhar sobre o que pode ser uma vida, que sem ainda terminar, necessita de uma certa pausa para poder depois continuar.

0440237688|4.0|A friend's daughter was required to read this book for school, and the mom was so struck by it she gave it to me.  It is haunting, compelling, hard to put down.  A lot to think about.  This book should make us question where we are going and also make us take a hard look at the past.  This current weekend of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday was an excellent time to read this.  As the book addresses much about memories, both painful and pleasurable, this is an opportune time to reflect on our beliefs, actions towards others, and what we want for our children.  An outstanding book, The Giver is wonderful for young people and adults.  This book will stay with me, as some other books in my life have done, constantly challenging me to think and feel when I recall the story.  Top-notch!
B00004W221|4.0|For the record, I must admit that I am an anomaly. I am a 36 year-old male, and I don't give a hooey about football, or sports in general. Yet, &quot;Rudy&quot; is one of my favorite movies. OK, I suppose if you love football, you will get an extra ten yards out of this film. But this film is mainly about the triumph of the human spirit over the chiding of the nay-sayers. The acting is uniformly excellent. This is a &quot;feel good&quot; movie that will have you standing in front of your TV cheering, &quot;Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!&quot; right along with the 59,000 other fans in the final incredibly uplifting scene. That's right ... the final scene was filmed during half-time at an actual Notre Dame game! Today I suppose the film maker would fill the stands with CGI fans just because they can, but there is no way CGI could even come close to the energy of that final sequence during a live game! Watch this film, even if you hate football, and it may just become one of your favorites anyway.
B00006LSM3|3.0|First, let me say that I have L-O-V-E-D listening to the solo efforts of George Harrison. Compared to most musical artists who make solo albums or CDs after being in a highly successful group, the individual artist's music is significantly poor in comparison to the \\"glory days\\" of the band that made this person famous in the first place (Paul McCartney is a fine example). George was different! Starting with \\"Wonderwall Music,\\" there was a special quality to George's music. Of course, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Cloud Nine\\" are well known and deserve much praise, but other albums were wonderful in their own right (\\"George Harrison,\\" \\"Thirty-Three and 1/3,\\" and \\"Live in Japan\\" are as good as anything he recorded but are over-looked). Even the albums that were not consistently strong throughout had great songs included: \\"Give Me Love,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,\\" \\"This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying)\\" and \\"Dream Away\\" are prominent examples. I would love to jump up and shout about how great the music is here in \\"Brainwashed,\\" but I think it is like other unremarkable efforts of George's, a beautiful song or two mixed in with truly forgettable music. (\\"Stuck in a cloud is the gem; a   beautiful song!)  Hey, I ran out and bought this hoping to be moved like I have been time and time again, but I have to agree with the reviewer who says you should look to \\"All Things Must Pass\\" to really appreciate George's music; HOWEVER, I say get the 30th anniversary addition for the reworked version of \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" which will give you a nice surprise!
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo and Stitch is the story of a little girl, Lilo, being raised by her sister Nani.  She is allowed to adopt a dog, Stitch, and together Lilo and Stitch find themselves in one situation after another.<br />This movie was great!  The characters were believeable (OK, except for Stitch).  I was very impressed by the way the characters were drawn.  Thank goodness there were no stick people in this movie!  It was so refreshing to see Nani and Lilo along with the other \\"human\\" characters in this movie drawn with real bodies and not perfect figures.  I can't express enough how much I was thrilled with this.  <br />The storyline of this movie is very touching.  Lilo has trouble fitting in with other kids her age because of her not having parents.  As to the other reviewers that discussed her behavior--so what!  No child is perfect all the time.  Lilo does act out but that is because she isn't treated nicely by the other kids. She also doesn't have parents to correct her when she's wrong and she has a sister that's busy working so she can keep Lilo with her.  And as to the way Nani and Lilo talked to each other, this just seemed like a typical exchange between siblings.  <br />The soundtrack of this movie was great also!!  I love the way they included the Elvis songs in the movie.  They were put in so that it seemed natural and not just thrown in on a whim. The admiration that Lilo has for Elvis made the songs fit so well. I loved the \\"model citizen\\" segment.  Stitch in an Elvis jumpsuit is just too cute!!!!!  <br />I loved every aspect of this movie.  I've read other reviews in which the reviewers said there wasn't a moral storyline in the movie.  But there is.  The moral of this story from my viewpoint is this:  don't treat other people badly just because they are different from you.  Lilo was different from the other girls and they excluded her from their group.  That is one of the reasons Stitch appealed to her so much.  She knew he was different but she didn't turn away from him.  She knew how it felt to be the outcast and she didn't want to do that to him.  She was just glad to have a friend.  Another storyline in this movie that I liked was the family and that not all families are the same.  This family was small and broken--but it was good.  In todays society I think it's important for kids to understand that not all families may not be like theirs.  To reviewers that think Snow White has a better moral storyline--hello???  A girl living alone with 7 strange men???  This is a good moral story?????  Think again.  <br />This movie was just awesome.  It was good to see something from Disney that had todays issues in it.  To all the people who didn't like the movie, that's your choice, but I thought this was one of the best animated movies to be released in a long time. I just can't say enough about it, it is quite possibly the best animated movie to ever be released.  A keeper for anyone's collection.
0790741164|2.0|If you want to watch Oliver Stone's take on the JFK assasination, by all means, watch this movie.  But don't take this film version of events as gospel truth. Its a conspiracy movie, pure and simple.  Oliver Stone's version of what HE thinks happened.<br />John F. Kennedy was a conservative democrat compared to today's liberal democrats.  I can't believe people actually considered this movie as uncovering the TRUTH.  Give me a break.  This film bored me to death.
0553801511|5.0|I just finished reading Robin Hobb's Second installment and I actually breathed a sigh of relief. Finally a middle book worth my time.<BR>I must disagree with those reviewers who said there isn't much in the way of plot development in this installment. This entirely not true. True, Fitz is not off racing into the mountains, but the large amount of information revealed in this book is daunting (I had to go back and look at one of the characters in the Liveship Triology)<BR>The relationships from both The Assasin's Triology and Liveship Triology are brought back in this book and given astonshing twists. And we FINALLy get to Fitz interact with All of his children which is great. The pace of the book is a little slower than the first book, but it was worth it. The only question we are left hanging onto is \\"will there be another bond-mate\\".<BR>If this is your first Robin Hobb's triology, you are really doing yourself a disservice if you do not go and read the two preceding trilogies. I refuse to ruin the book for you, but I can't imagine how you can figure anything out without that background. Overall, during this month of duds this is welcome treat.
0792162803|1.0|This is by far the WORST SNL spin-off movie. I sat through the entire movie without even cracking a smile. Thats how un-funny it was. I mean A Night At The Roxbury was terrible too, but i at least laughed a few times. This movie just totally goes to show everyone that the old SNL casts were 1,000,000 times better. This cast [wasnt good]. They are NOT funny. They try way too hard to be funny and it dosn't work. The \\"Superstar\\" skits on SNL were terrible to begin with. This movie was just a bunch of the un-funny skits rolled into one 90 minute movie that you will be sure to throw out. If you want a TRUE SNL spin-off movie from the cast that is actually funny without even trying, get Wayne's World, Wayne's World 2, The Blues Brothers, or Coneheads. I will NEVER watch this movie again. And if you are one of the people who think that this SNL cast is just hilarious, watch an old episode of SNL and then a new episode and listen to the audience laughing. The laughs decrease once this cast rolls in.<br />\\"Superstar\\" runs for about 90 minutes.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual humor, and some language.
6303014100|5.0|What makes this one of the best civil war fils of all time is the accuracy, the uniforms were accurate from the hats to the boots or in the Confederacy's case, bare feet.Almost all the battle scenes were filmed at the actual location except for Little Round Top because the hill was too steep and there were too many monuments, so it was filmed at a nearby hill instead.The 4 hour length was a bit shocking at first, but I'd prefer this in an heartbeat to some inaccurate, hollywood style 2 hour film. \\"Gettysburg\\" wasn't the least bit boring at all.<br />      The acting was great Jeff Daniels did such a fine job I didn't think of him as the idiot from \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" once throughout the film. Tom Berenger did a great job as General James Longstreet sruggling with the agony of sending his army into a valley of death. Martin Sheen was excellent as the quiet gentleman Robert E. Lee, who is faced with many hard choices and problems. Jeff Daniels was touching as \\"citizen soldier\\" Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a former Bowdain college proffesor with no military experience. Stephen Lang who will be playing \\"Stone wall\\" Jackson in \\"Gods and Generals\\", is great as Pickett but I can't picture him as the tall, lean, and heroic Jackson. Richard Jordan is excellent as my great-great-great-grandfather Lewis Armistead.<br />     I like how the film focuses on the character's emotions more then the action. There was no good and bad side to the Civil War. Same God, same land, different dreams.We go back and forth from the Confederate camps to the Federal camps and your heart goes out to the men on both sides.They both share the same conflicts and heartbreaks.The score and cinematography are beautiful as well. You feel how badly Fedaerals want to preserve the Union and get justice for the slaves and how the Confederacy wants preserve the Olde South. This makes Gettysburg perhaps the best Civil War film ever.
0671027344|5.0|I was a little neglectant to read this book at first, but I promised a friend I would, so when I saw it in the book store I bought it. <br />I started reading it, and the main character caught my attention instantly. He was so insightful and real, and told the truth even when countless other people would have lied. The book doesn't pick up the pace till about page 30, where it becomes impossible to put it down. When I let people barrow it, I always say, \\"read it when you have a lot of time, because you won't be able to stop reading.\\" <br />The only time I could stop was when Charlie described being 'Infinite'. And it was like my whole world all of the sudden made sense. I just dropped the book and realized that Charlie wasn't a great character, he was one of the greatest characters in recent books. I honestly don't think this book could have been better, other people may disagree, but some people are so busy comparing this book to \\"Catcher\\" that it fogs over how good this book is. They actually describe this in the book, when people say Kurt Cobain is the new John Lennon. I think that was Chbosky shouting out, \\"Hey, I know no one can being truly original now. And I know teens will always be compared to Holden. But I am going to try anyway.\\"
051788710X|5.0|This is a book about catching dreams.  It is an easy-to-read and fascinating guide to all those who want to know more about themselves and their night visions.  It takes nothing for granted, starting with the most basic advice but then taking the student dreamer to very advanced work (dreaming of the departed, for example, and shamanic dreaming).  What makes it a fun read are all the examples, delightful stories that illustrate the different dream types.  More importantly, however, is the substance within the book.  Beginning with nine keys to dreaming (a help to those who are just starting to record their dreams), it explains basic etiquette for dream sharing, how to recognize precognitive dreams, working with dream guides, and even how to use dreams for healing.  It is a book you can keep and work with over and over, no matter how experienced you become with the dreaming.  I recommend it highly.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I saw this movie before I read the book and loved it.<BR>Now that I have read the book I notice a few discrepancies but they do not take away from the movie unless you are extremely into authenticity. The color in this version is superb especially compared to the A&amp;E version. When comparing the two I definatley prefer this version. I think that Gwyneth Paltrow portays Emma's personality wonderfully; she matches the books description very, very well. I reccomend this version.
0060245867|4.0|Children really like this book.  They like the interweaving of the day, the consequences of each action leading to another.  The mouse is cute and enthusiastic, and the boy is sweet and helpful.<br />As a mother, I find this book too similar to my life to be amused.  My day is a constant stream of \\"give this, oh and now give that.\\"  I've pointed out to my children that I feel exactly like that little boy at the end of a long day.  :-)  Despite that, they still like to have this book read to them.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This delightful movie stars Hugh Grant who, ever on the lookout for a new approach with women, discovers that single moms are more than happy to have a romance with single dads.  Despite the fact that Grant has no child, he makes one up and joins a single parents' group so he can meet women.  Soon he becomes involved with a woman whose friend is suicidal and who has a son who is teased at school for being a nerd.  Grant is not pleased with the fact that the boy likes to hang out at his place after school, but he doesn't have the heart to kick the boy out.  Later on, the boy becomes an asset when he meets a woman with a son his age.  Again he lets her think that he is a single father, but this leads to even more complications.  This is a charming movie about a man who thinks that he can be an island, but who finds out differently.
B00003CXB6|5.0|When you read these poor reviews to this movie it really turns you away from it. But in my opinion this movie was one of Steven's best and still is. If you compare it to the horrible Jurassic Park 3 it's a classic. Just don't judge a movie by reviews and watch it. You'll probably enjoy it.
B00005U11Z|3.0|I know very well that the new singer's first name IS Steve.  He almost sounds like Steve Perry, as he can hit the notes, and sometimes he almost looks like Steve Perry.  But, for some reason, I cannot watch this without constantly thinking \\"Why did they record this concert with the Understudy?\\"<br />An understudy, by the way, is someone who plays the role when the one who's Supposed to Be There is absent.<br />I bought this with the knowledge that it was the Understudy, as I had fun seeing them live with the Understudy.  And as much fun as I had, and as much fun as I have listening to the songs and jumping and dancing around the living room while it's playing, I cannot WATCH.<br />This DVD has all your favorites from Journey, and the Understudy does a good impersonation of Steve Perry, but for those who miss Steve Perry, don't turn the TV on, just listen to it and then you'll be satisfied.<br />By the way, the sound on this DVD is Tremendous!!!<br />So turn the picture off and PUMP UP THE VOLUME!!!

B00005OAIE|5.0|Mayer's lyrics are clever, thoughtful, fun, and deeply human. I could relate well to his songs. All my friends agree, he sings in such a personal way that it feels as if he actually came into the room, sat down, and started playing and singing just for you. His intimate style draws you close and makes you stay. His voice is amazing and, quite frankly, sexy. I highly recommend this cd!

1563890119|5.0|Gaiman's incredible Sandman series starts with this collection. While trying to capture the personification of Death (a tried and true fantasy convention) a magician captures instead the King of<br />Dreams, who remains his prisoner for seven decades until he (Dream) is finally given an opportunity to escape. Comic book conventions come into play at the beginning with guest appearances by John Constantine and Etrigan as Dream pursues his lost tools of office. But when Dream finally confronts the man,(a minor DC villain,Dr. Destiny)who possesses the last of these tools the series enters a different realm far from the typical comic book. Taking his lead from Alan Moore's work on Swamp Thing, Gaiman creates an atmosphere of real horror as Dr. Destiny warps the lives of a few unlucky diner patrons, driving them to madness before he is finally stopped by Dream. It is in the scenes at the diner Gamain's talent really comes to the forefront and you realize that this is no typical comic book experience. By showing the gradual destruction of these characters Gaiman give the reader a peak at what becomes the theme of the entire series; the power of dreams in our lives.<br /><br />Relic113
B00005AAFS|5.0|This is simply an amazing album. Lyrically, it marks a huge accomplishment for the band. They have matured a bit from the oft-seen \\"kill, burn, destroy\\" idealogy that was found on Herzeleid, and then Sehnsucht. The title track, which translates as \\"Mother\\", is less a song and more of an experience. Having a knowledge of the German language probably helped me form such a strong liking. I was born in Germany, so the lyrics make sense to me. Plenty of strong guitar riffs, great beats throughout, and the kick-... Rammstein attitude make this an album worth buying. You won't be disappointed.
B000067CPX|5.0|The best Chili Peppers CD by far!  Californication was good but this is soooo much better.  Great melodies and singability!  Can't think of a bad song--maybe border line on Cabron.  I cannot burn out this CD.  I have been listening to this CD since it was first released and still love every minute of it.  I am just surprised by the lack of critical acclaim.  PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THESE, PEPPERS!
B00006LIRI|3.0|This double CD Best-of was a logical release following the 1980-1990 Best-of. As I found this best-of great, I decided to try this one, but not forgetting this is a commercial purpose release. Indeed, those who had the first part may be intersted.<BR>So one may think this is another pointless release to make money. But on seconds thought, this is not bad at all. <br />In fact, making a second best-of u2 was a hard task. But it seems those who made it didn't really realize it and made it as quickly as they could. But hey, how long did the fans wait to have this second part ? Did they think about the disappointment it could provoke ? This needed to be worth the wait !<br />One easy thing was to include the hits :<BR>- One<BR>- Stay<BR>- Staring at the sun<BR>- Stuck in a moment...<BR>- Beautiful day<BR>- Hold me, thrill me... (from the Batman forever, curiously they didn't forget this one)<BR>But they forgot :<BR>- Elevation<BR>- Walk on<br />Why did they put remixes on the first CD, since this one was made to contain the original songs ? And curiously, the original version of &quot;Electrical storm&quot; can be found on the second one, and the remix is on the first CD.<br />I'm completely against remixes. Though, I try to find some positive aspects in them. But when there are so many like on this release, that's really annoying ! Some songs have even two remixes, and no original version : &quot;Discothèque&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;. Why ? But thank God the remix didn't fall on &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Beautiful day&quot; !<br />What really doesn't makes me laugh is the ridiculous names of the remixes, as if they were put just to annoy you :<BR>- William orbit mix<BR>- Junk day mix<BR>- Gun mix<BR>- Zooromancer mix<BR>- Perfecto mix<BR>- Jeep mix<BR>- Hexidecimal mix<BR>- Solar plexus club mix<BR>and to finnish, let's quote the best  <BR>- Gimme some more dignity mix !!<BR>Really makes me sick, they are making of us !<br />Something needs to be said : U2 is a rock band, or a pop band, if you want, but it's certainly no disco band, no dj's band, remixes don't really have their place here. But I think it could have been worse. In fact, especially due to the songs of the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and &quot;All that you can't leave behind&quot; albums, the compilation is saved : it couldn't really be bad because some songs absolutely needed to be included. The whole CD is not bad. I suggest it, if you don't own the 90's albums. But needless to say you'll be disappointed if you already have them.

B000002GF8|4.0|I bought this CD with a gift certificate that I got for Christmas, and, much to the chagrin of my parents, I have been listening to it constantly, rather loudly, ever since it arrived.<br />This was my third Police CD - the second one (Zenyatta Mondatta) was another Christmas gift and the first one was the original 'classics' album, which I borrowed from my dad (read: I took it from my dad, which would be far more significant if we didn't live in the same house...). This CD is my favorite one thus far. Murder by Numbers is an excellent song - the tempo and background music perfectly fits the theme. Both of the 'Synchronicity' songs are very catchy - once you've learned the words, I guarantee that you will be singing Synchronicity II all day long. <br />The only reason that I gave this song four stars instead of five was the tragic inclusion of 'Mother', a hideous piece of 'music' by Andy Summers. I can't see the point of the song at all - it's just strange background music with either Summers or Sting (I can't quite tell which, but it certainly doesn't sound like Sting) shrieking about how his girlfriends all seem to end up like his mother. Oedipus Rex, anyone?<br />Anyway, I would definitely reccomend this CD to anyone who is interested in The Police. The best tracks on this album: Both Synchronicity songs, Miss Gradenko, Tea In The Sahara, and Murder by Numbers.
0312305060|2.0|I enjoyed the author's method of writing, and his vivid descriptions were wonderful.  I was somewhat satisfied with the book until the last few chapters when things just got, well...stupid.  I think each character was beautifully written, but the way they were brought together was uncreative.  I was appalled with the simple ending to this book.  I fumbled throught the entire book hoping for a decent amount of closure, but was left disappointed.  In all I applaud the author for his characterization and style, but I would ask him to sit a little longer next time thinking of a more solid plot.
B00003CWMI|5.0|I began watching this movie out of desperation.  I was bored and had already seen most of the other movies on the new release wall at the video store so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.  I expected it to be a silly and basically lame kids type of movie, but boy was I shocked! Although it is a fun movie that kids will enjoy (at least for the first 1/2 hour) it quickly advances to the next level and explores the complexities of human nature, emotions, and immortality.  I even found myself crying at the end at one of the most touching movies I've seen in a very long time.  I highly, highly recommend this terrific movie although I would be cautious with younger viewers as there is a lot of sexual innuendo that Williams is well known for.

B000001A3H|5.0|Looking at nothing more than the inside cover photo of a monstrous bass amplifier standing alone in the middle of the barren desert should fill any listener with fear and glee over the adrenaline soaked exorcism they are about to undergo.  If there was ever an album that truly summed up and encapsulated the anguish, desolation, and rage writhing deep in California's low desert, Kyuss' \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\" was it.  Though Kyuss' previous studio effort Wretch was, on a whole, not a bad album, the poor production values and varying song quality painted a biased, incomplete picture of the original Stoner Rock giants.  The unjust slant of this important debut recording failed on most counts to replicate the band's explosive live sound on CD, but any fears concerning Kyuss' career in the studio were quickly put to rest upon the release of their second album.  Enlisting longtime friend and Masters of Reality bandleader Chris Goss to produce their sophomore effort, Kyuss' dynamics and still maturing sound grew both in size and pure, undiluted power to reach unfathomed new levels of intensity.  With obviously heightened abilities and energy levels running high, the earthy drums, giant guitars, and impassioned vocals of \\"Blues...\\" defined their own dark realm.   This nearly tangible atmosphere permeated throughout the entire album, seething and exerting waves of utter destruction with each and every searing note. Goss' production work, which was integral in the seamless blending of Kyuss' melodic ferocity, is nothing short of brilliant; Coupled with the already formidable band itself, Blues for the Red Sun was the beginning of the single most successful and complimentary musical relationship in all of Stoner Rock's growing history.  When all is said and done though, Kyuss' legendary second album was not only a striking display of the band's impressive songwriting capabilities, dripping with talent and creativity at every turn, but also a showcase of the group's status of one of Stoner Rock's most intelligent, well informed musical acts. Drawing from heavy music dating back to early Black Sabbath all the way through to the annals of grunge, the open rage behind Garcia's beastly yowls and the guitars insatiable lust for annihilation are only made more captivating by their well planned nods to literally decades of hard rock innovators. Kyuss may be a new band pioneering a brand new genre, but they have no egotistical qualms about letting the world know who their influences are.  A definitive Stoner Rock essential and undoubtedly one of Kyuss' finest works, Blues for the Red Sun set the new standard for all hard rock bands to come, proving to be a vital touchstone in the shaping of underground metal throughout the 90s and beyond.
6303234844|5.0|There is none. This is a fantastic show and every PG fan that has seen this knows it. I went into it leary of hearing someone try and duplicate the Kate Bush part of Don't Give Up. Paula Cole did not duplicate, she made it her own, and you feel it with her, wonderful. PG mixes some his most wonderful tracks with some great theatrics and stage props, and he can never lose with such an unusual and professional band. The camera allows you right in the middle of the action, and then makes you feel like your right in the crowd.<BR>You'll laugh where you should, and cry where you should. I'd be more specific about all of these points, but I really would like you to see this for yourself. If you've seen Peter live, you gotta see this. If you haven't, it's time you did.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave, combines the forces of Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) and the former members of Rage Against The Machine, and has been labelled as the \\"Must-have\\" album since the demos, under the name of Civilian were leaked onto Internet.<br />Cornell is in his element, and his influence is striking on the album, which naturally prompts accusations of this being the follow up to Euphoria Morning, but it isn't.  While there are the quirky guitar effects and the harsh percussion, the former RATM-ers have had to adapt themselves to a singer rather than a rapper- and have done a good job too.   Cochise is a powerful and enigmatic way to start the album and Show Me How To Live has an irresistible hip swinging quality to it, but it isn't all hard rock.  What You Are, is a fantastic slower paced offering and Getaway Car is absolutely perfect with The Last Remaining Light ending the album on a thoughtful note.  Is Audioslave one of the `albums of the year'?  Undoubtedly yes, and I hope that they continue with this project for a very long time.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I propose to you a question. How else does a band follow up the albulm of their careers? DUH! Make a record about a little girl named Yoshimi, and how she must destroy evil pink robots.  No this is no fluke boys and girls The Flaming Lips have returnred and have made, perhaps , a record of equal importance to that of \\"The Soft Bulletin\\".  Where \\"Bulletin\\" showed signs of weakness, \\"Yoshimi\\" takes the ability of studio craftmanship and the band flys with it.  Singer Wayne Coyne shows an uncanny depth with his lyrics and metaphors about life and death.  He (like Dean Wareham of Luna), hold our hand and show us comfort through humor.  Those who brush off the albulm as some sort of odd medicine show, are missing the point entirely.  Only after repeated listens is the audience allowed a peek behind the curtain to see what the band is really up to.  On songs such as \\"Flight Test\\", \\"Do You Realize\\", and the title track itself, the message of the albulm is finally delivered. A sweet yarn about how to find the courage and strength to love directly in the face of death. A beautiful message for, what might just be, the best record of two-thousand and two!

B000002U82|5.0|Okay, this probably won't get read, but 4 and 1/2 stars? Are you crazy? This is not only a great album, it is also one of the highest selling albums and stayed on the charts for a very very long time. This album didn't only encourage all prog rock bands, it effected all music as we know it. Gilmour's guitar and voice are excellent from the beginning (Breathe) to the end (Eclipse) making you not want to turn off the cd until it is finished. Even after that you might want to play it again. There is not one bad song, and in fact, they are all perfect and there is nothing I would change. But if you want to know the best song, it easily Time, with it catchy rythm and superb instrumental break. Seriously, if you don't have this album, get it. You won't be disappointed, and odds are you already have it. If you do have it, please rate this as a 5 so I won't have to bare seeing that 4 and a half. Its disappointing and astonishing. An album with such a great impact doesn't deserve this treatment. If I could, I'd give this album a ten on a scale of 1 to 5.
B00005JL2O|2.0|If you've seen the first two movies of this series, which are just too good, then you've seen just about every joke in Goldmember. Just got a bit too tedious to listen to &quot;Oh behave&quot; without any really new angles of humor. Mini-Me defecting was random. There was no real chemistry between Austin and his latest babe. And yes, we're tired of the time travel business. If you really have nothing to do and want to watch a movie, just rewatch the first two in this series.
B00005JLD2|5.0|This is a marvelously successful movie that is especially moving because the story it tells is true. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is the story of how Australia for several decades took half-caste aboriginal children (i.e., children of mixed white and aboriginal parentage) and raised them in what was essentially an orphanage school to become domestic servants. The film focuses on three girls--Molly, Daisy, and Gracie--who live beside one of Australia's rabbit-proof fences that cover the country and are taken from their mother to live at the school. The bulk of the movie tells of their escape and 1300 mile journey following the rabbit-proof fence back to their mother.<br />Three things stand out about this movie. First, the simplicity of the story. This is a movie that has easily identifiable good and bad guys. The policy the government embarked on for several decades was obviously and irredeemably racist and evil, and in part made more tragic by not being widely reported. I know a couple of Australians living here in Chicago, and both say they had never heard of this practice while growing up. This film does an enormous service to humankind by publicizing this great crime.<br />Second, the performances by the three girls in the central roles are marvelous. In particular, Everylyn Sampi, as Molly, the oldest of the three girls, stands out. What is remarkable is the three girls were utter amateurs, with no acting experience at all. Sampi manages to imbue her Molly with both great intelligence and iron-willed determination.<br />Third, the film is both a visual and aural delight. I have over the years seen a lot of films shot in Australia, most of them much further east than this one. Most of it occurs in areas of Australia that are less familiar. I saw this film in a theater with five-point sound, and I have rarely seen a film that made better use of that than this one.<br />This is one of those films that no fan of film should miss. It tells a magnificent and true story well. One of the most moving moments is when two of the real life girls, now elderly women, are shown. Just a great movie.One of the most moving moments is when two of the real life girls, now elderly women, are shown. Just a great movie.

0743216385|4.0|If you have neither read Stephen Ambrose's book or seen the HBO mini-series \\"Band of Brothers\\" and are wondering which you should do first, then my recommendation would be to watch the mini-series first.  This would be especially true if you are the sort of person who remembers books in vivid detail so that alarms go off in your brain every time there is a significant departure on the screen from the written word.  In that case your enjoyment of the mini-series would be derailed by every \\"that is not how it really happened\\" or \\"it was not Person A but Person B who did X.\\"  However, if you start with the mini-series and then read the book you will discover how most of the episodes were based on the skimpiest details (the first two episodes are far and away the ones that most rely on the details of Ambrose's book).<br />I found that my reaction to the book was basically the same as it had been to the mini-series: I have tremendous respect for Dick Winters and I wish there was much more to what I was reading/watching.  When I got this book I was surprised \\"Band of Brothers\\" was \\"only\\" 333 pages long.  One of the strengths of the book is how Ambrose takes advantage of the dual perspective of his sources, who not only recall what they were doing and thinking during World War II, but also what their thoughts are today about what happened back then.  However, Ambrose does tend to repeatedly make some key points in his editorial commentary on the historical narrative.<br />It might be some sort of heresy, but it does not especially matter to me whether or not Easy Company was the premier unit of the United States military during World War II.  What is of importance here is the story of the war told from the perspective of \\"common\\" soldiers.  For the most part when I have read war books they have been big picture books and usually about the Civil War (e.g., Catton, Foote, McPherson), but there is certainly something to be said for the more personal memoirs (e.g., Sam Watkins' \\"Company Aytch\\").  That might be why I liked the sections where the actual soldiers provided first person narratives of their story; I would not have minded at all if this had been more of a cut and paste job where Ambrose linked his collection of interviews, letters, and memoirs.  However, the thing I would stress is that if you liked the mini-series you should still read the book and get more of the true story of Easy Company.ns' \\"Company Aytch\\").

B000067CPX|5.0|I'm not going to go on for pages and pages about how amazing the Red Hot Chili Peppers are, because I don't know enough about them to do so. If you would've asked me a month ago to buy a Chili Peppers album, I'd have laughed right in your face. They never appeal to me, but my mate lent me this to my extreme hesitation. I popped By The Way into my CD player and have not been able to stop listening to it. Who would've thought it? Pop extraordinare buffy-freak - fan on Britney, Shania and Mariah - writing a review for a RHCP album?! I am so in love with this record and just can't stop listening to it. By The Way is (so I've read) a return to more melodic, almost poppy, roots for RHCP. This is certainly apparent; almost every song on the album has a catchy vocal arrangement, which intrigues the listener like no other band can do.<br /><br />By The Way begins with the first single from the album, \\"By The Way.\\" A UK No.2 single in the summer of 2002, this superb slice of mid-tempo rock is the Red Hot Chili Peppers at their best. The soft choruses are followed by a superb break-out rock rap type-thingy! The only letdown is that this song has been overplayed on the radio. \\"Universally Speaking\\" is a diverse slice of laid-back rock/pop. Anthony Kiedis' heart-felt vocals are amazing, even more so when contrasted alongside the background harmonising. \\"This Is The Place\\" is an album highlight on By The Way. The lyrical content of the composition is breathtaking and memorable, especially the chorus (\\"Shocking, appalling\\") which is one of the most outstanding on the record - and that deep guitar pick in the background is very heavy. \\"Dosed\\" is another album highlight for me, because of that incredibly infectious and beautiful guitar picking. The message of the song is one of love - and the song always reminds me of Scar Tissue.<br /><br />\\"Don't Forget Me\\" is a critical and public triumph. The way Kiedis' vocals extend beyond their own tradition, yet sound wonderfully original makes this moody and melancholy song so excellent. \\"The Zephyr Song\\" was the second single to be taken from By The Way late last year. The beat has an almost Latin feel to it, proving that the RHCP elastic band of music capability continues to stretch and stretch. \\"Can't Stop\\" is a phenomenal song, and a favourite on By The Way of many listeners. It's a return to tradition for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and they pull it off superbly. The funky rap-style vocals of Kiedis begin after a brilliant guitar intro and don't give up until the last second of the song. \\"I Could Die For You\\" and \\"Midnight\\" are my two least favourite songs from the album, yet they are still great. The former is a soft and lovely ballad - perfect to chill out to, while the latter is definitely a change of pace for the RHCP, compared to the rest of the record - and their career.<br /><br />The album continues brilliantly with \\"Throw Away Your Television.\\" The incredibly deep booming bassline is perfectly contrasted with Kiedis' serious and haunting vocals. There's just something about the song that intrigues me! \\"Cabron\\" is a unique yet welcome change from the traditional RHCP style. The song has an almost folk influence to it - yes, complete with a strangely addictive Caribbean twist! Everyone seems to go on about \\"Tear,\\" and with good reason! This is simply one of the finest songs in the RHCP cannon. \\"On Mercury\\" is just perfection - an album highlight, the song has that infamous catchy vocal arrangement from the RHCP, and some strange yet descriptive lyrics. The song is very up-tempo and the verses have a very distinct style. The choruses are complete with superb harmonising to add to the anthemic feel of the song.<br /><br />\\"Minor Thing\\" is another pure class song from By The Way. One of my favourites, the vocal arrangement is superb, especially on the \\"You've got your bit part, Mozart, hot dart acceleration, pop art, pistol chasin', cat fight intimidation,\\" line. \\"Warm Tape\\" is a superb mid-tempo chill out track with a brilliant bassline, and the mood of the song is very mellow - representing their current musical style. The final song, \\"Venice Queen\\" is a song of two halves. I'm not sure what they are, but they change direction and consistency quite often. Not only is it an excellent song, but leaves you wondering what style the Red Hot Chili Peppers will take on their next offering...<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />By The Way is one of the most amazing records I've ever heard - and is up there with Alanis' Jagged Little Pill and Madonna's Ray Of Light as one of my all-time favourite albums. One feels they have truly got their money's worth with By The Way - almost 70 minutes of pure class, vocal supremacy and downright inspiration. All these factors make By The Way the greatest rock record of the 21st Century...so far, but it'll be quite some time before anything else replaces it.iant bassline, and the mood of the song is very mellow - representing their current musical style.

B00005OAIE|5.0|Ignore what the Amazon.com Review says right now. If you haven't read it, read it, and then ignore it. What the rewiew seems to forget is that humans have emotions, and Mayer, in his songs, captures the best of a young man's emotions. Simple things, like saying the wrong thing on a date and complex things, such as the emotion involved in a break up and the twisted feeling when your ex is seen again and again and again.<BR>Either the review for Room For Squares was a shut in...well, you decide, but I'm giving this CD 5 stars because it is a well lyriced, well played, and most of all GREAT sounding CD.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|\\"Emma\\" was made during a spate of Jane Austen films and miniseries awhile back, and thankfully (except for the fiasco called \\"Mansfield Park\\") all of them have been fantastic. Gwyneth Paltrow provides some droll comic relief as the title heroine of the movie \\"Emma,\\" proving that yes, she CAN act quite well.<br />Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow) is on a matchmaking rush after she successfully pairs her former governess to a rich widower. Convinced that she can make a good match for anybody, she sets out to pair her penniless, sweet-natured pal Harriet Smith (Toni Collette) with someone more elevated than a prosperous young farmer, such as the eager young minister, Mr. Elton (Alan Cumming). Problem is, Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma, not Harriet.<br />More romantic complications ensue when a charming bad boy, Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor in a bad wig) comes to the area and seems to be interested in Emma -- until Emma decides to pair him with Harriet. Emma's good-natured meddling continues unchecked, until it threatens her own happiness and her unspoken love.<br />\\"Emma\\" is probably the frothiest of Austen's novels; there aren't any big scandals or anything like that.  Embarrassment is the big opponent in here, but Douglas McGrath has a good sense of how to use the droll humor to best advantage. This is definitely a comedy, except for one or two moments near the end; even there, it's amusing when Emma wails \\"I love John! I hate John!\\". The only source of humor that falls flat is Mrs. Elton, who is too overdone in her vulgarity and stupidity. Bit of a cheap laugh there.<br />Gwyneth Paltrow seems very in-her-element as Emma, managing to be cute and fumbling without ever making Emma seem precious or stupid. Ewan McGregor may hide whenever he sees his performance, but he's pretty good as Frank (and fans of his should definitely see him sing a duet with Paltrow -- he has a wonderful voice). Toni Collette is sweet as Emma's rather naive younger friend, Denys Hawthorne endearing as Emma's hypochondriac dad (he's kind of weird, but likeably so), Alan Cumming annoying as the juvenile Mr. Elton, and Greta Scacchi does a great turn as Emma's kindly mother-figure. And Jeremy Northam steals the show as Mr. Knightley, the barb-tongued aristocrat with a kindly heart and a genuine affection for Emma, even though her romantic prodding makes him nuts.<br />There are a few points in the movie where it does seem a little too light and frothy, but fortunately most of the time the direction stays in sync with the storyline.  The lighting, the costumes, the music -- all of them are cute and lightweight. Kids can watch this as well as adults, since there are Disney cartoons that are more offensive than this. (But younger kids will be bored out of their skulls, probably)<br />\\"Emma\\" is a great film for anyone in search of a genuine comedy with lots of laughs and no stupid gags.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Over the years, Christina Aguilera has gained a reputation for wearing tacky and tasteless clothing and being a downright selfish little madam! Her raunchy image in videos such as Lady Marmalade and Dirrty did nothing to help her put a stop to this reputation. And that's basically because she didn't want to. Christina Aguilera is a very strong woman, who isn't afraid to speak her mind and put forth her views - no matter how controversial they are. I respect her immensely for this fact, as well as being a multi-talented performer; her vocal ability is superb. Christina took a couple of years off to get her head screwed on, write some amazing songs, gain a sensible perspective and live her life. She has returned with this fantastic offering, Stripped. The girl...excuse me, woman, has easily dumped the \\"teen pop\\" image for something more adult and grown up.<br /><br />Stripped begins with \\"Stripped Intro.\\" This is a very good intro - much better than some others I've heard - in which Christina addresses her critics. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is next and features Lil' Kim. This is such an amazing song that sounds just perfect for Stripped. The verses are very funky, the beat is trippy and the chorus has a very anthemic feel to it. \\"Walk Away\\" is another superb mid-tempo song about a disastrous relationship Aguilera has been through. Her voice is superb on this song, which sounds very similar to Alicia Keys' Fallin' - an album highlight for sure. \\"Fighter\\" is a very inspirational song about strength. The bassline is very rocky, and suits the song well. \\"Primer Amor Interlude\\" comes before \\"Infatuation.\\" This is a very cool mid-tempo song about Christina's dream love of her life. The Spanish guitar is brilliant, and adds that spicy touch to the song.<br /><br />Another interlude - \\"Loves Embrace\\" - follows, before \\"Loving Me 4 Me.\\" This Mariah Carey-style ballad showcases Christina's vocal range to the max. The song is about Aguilera's lover loving her for her - not her image. \\"Impossible\\" is another superb mid-tempo ballad written, arranged and composed by the wonder talent that is Alicia Keys. The song would fit perfectly on Keys' Songs In A Minor - mainly due to its brilliant lyrics; \\"This is not a circus, so don't play me for a clown. How long can emotions keep going up and down?\\" \\"Underappreciated\\" is a cool chill-out song in which Christina talks about her lover taking her for granted. \\"Beautiful\\" is the second single release from Stripped. This really is one of the best ballads I've ever heard. The way Christina's voice dips on the \\"From all the pain,\\" and, \\"I'm so ashamed,\\" lines is very classy and her \\"So don't you bring me down today,\\" line is superb. The video is very serious - about how you're beautiful, no matter how 'different' you are.<br /><br />Stripped continues in brilliant style with my favourite song from the album, \\"Make Over.\\" Imagine a 1960's 'hippy/flower power' influenced beat and a vocal arrangement in a similar style to that of Sugababes' Overload and you have a truly fantastic song! The lyrics are just so fun, and the chorus line, \\"I just want to get away! Saving all your bull**** for another day!\\" is downright inspirational - go Christina! \\"Cruz\\" and \\"Soar\\" are really amazing songs which I disliked to begin with, but now I really like them. \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is another album highlight for me. The song is very sexually charged, with some very naughty lyrics which must be where Christina gets her reputation from - I'd say the words, but I think you already know, and this review would have no change of being published! The song is just so smooth and sexy!<br /><br />\\"Dirrty\\" is the infamous smash hit No.1 single. Released back in November 2002, the song topped the UK singles chart for two weeks - and that controversial video truly was dirrty! \\"Stripped Pt. 2\\" is the follow up to the first intro way back at the beginning of Stripped. \\"The Voice Within\\" is a superb ballad with some superb lyrics and Aguilera's vocals are on top form. \\"I'm OK\\" is another album highlight. This superb ballad is about Christina's childhood, which she would deeply hard to record and says she will never sing it on stage because it hurts her too much to do so. \\"It hurt to see the pain across my mother's face. Every time my father's fist would put her in her place. Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room. Hoping it would be over soon,\\" sings Aguilera. \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\" closes the album. This song clocks in at almost six and a half minutes, and is about how Christina is going to keep going strong no matter how many times people might put her down.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Christina Aguilera has truly made an outstanding album here. It's a real shame that the general public just see Christina as someone who likes to wear next to nothing, instead of seeing her for what she really is - a truly exceptional and talented young lady who deserves a lot more credit. Stripped hasn't even made the UK Top 10, but I think over time (as people begin to hear the singles) it will. Aguilera worked with rock legend Linda Perry on the majority of Stripped, and the pairing works amazingly. Christina's heart and soul has been put into the album, and she should feel proud of it. I know she does.K\\" is another album highlight.

B00005JKNF|5.0|What a wonderful piece of cinema.  It is so smart.  I wish more movies would made liek this one.  The talent on this film film exudes from the screen.  I laughed and cried.  The extras are pretty good on this DVD.  I especially enjoyed the commentary from Altman
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singing in the rain is the greatest musical of all time and is one of the best films ever made. It has great songs and dance numbers and it has a good plot. When I heard that this movie was only 90 minutes long I thought it seemed to short and couldn't possibly have a good plot but the films running time is perfect and it gets the story across. This movie also has great performances from gene kelly,donald O'conner and debbie reynolds. The movie is bright colorful and its the feel good movie of all time. The Special edition DVD is amazing it features documentarys excerps and a commentary. The movie is bigger and better than ever. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who likes great movies.
B000002MUW|5.0|The madonna we know from the 80's is long gone, material girl? thats a thing of the past, and as for the erotica phase, well madonna never really went spiraling back into the whole \\"sex\\" thing after that. Her cd after erotica gives us a cool refreshing look at the madonna we know today. Not that all her other albums werent immaculate(pun intended, lol), but i like, like a suprisingly few amount of people prefer the madonna of today more than 80s madonna, if u r one of those peopple, this record is probably for u. The first track survival, not the best track, but a fine one, showuing us she'll \\"live to tell\\" what shes gone through, and what shell eventually go through. Next up is one of four gems off the cd, i think all the singles off this album are the best songs off the cd, thids song is one of her greatest songs, \\"secret\\". Secret is a fantastic song with great vocals and a terrific beat, but still somehow remains /beautiful and soothing. Thew third track although i like, i must say is the worst track on the album, it has something about it that kind of pushes us backward into the erotica phase, which again i thought was good, but also unlike erotcas stuff, pretty [bad] lyrics in some parts of the song. the fourth song Dont stop is a cool dance song, and is one of the best non-single songs on the album along with the softer \\"inside of me\\", the fifth track on the album. The next track is \\" Human Nature\\", a terrific song with a great r&b feel to it, unfortuanatly it didnt fare very welll in the charts. Forbidden love is the seventh song, in my opinion this is the best non-single song of the entire album, even better than don't stop. Lovce tried to welcome me, track 8, is a soothing tragic love song, a great listen when ur depressed, hehe. Santctuary, the ninth track , with eerie lyrics and sounds and a cool beat, shows us what is about to come - Bedtime story. Bedtime story, like human nature and rol\\"s Nothing really matters, is a fantastic song with an amazing overthe top video that the overall public just cant see for what it is, great, just because its something new and different, not like everything else on the radio and MTV. Bedtime story, with itsa oncredible sound effects, and madonnas innocent sounding woice make this surreal track and video some of madonnas best work of her carrer and show us what we could expect on her next studio albums, rol and music. The final track on this great cd is the nu,mber one hit \\"Take A Bow.\\" After listening to it, i understood its incredible success, its soothing sounds and tragic love story pull u in, and lets not forget the video with its great acting and direction as well as one of madonnas prettiest looks. Overall,this is a fantastic, but often misunderstood madonna album, if ur a fan, whether how big or small, get this album!!! If not then u might want to get both GHV2 and the IMMACULATE collection and hear what this diva has to offer.

B00005J6UP|5.0|Who would ever have imagined that a bunch of kids running from a mob family and searching for lost treasure would be such a hit?  The Goonies is a film about a group of kids trying to save their home from a greedy bank president who wants to turn their neighborhood, known as the goondocks, into a golf course.  Sean Astin and his pals find a treasure map and a \\"key\\" in the family attic and set off an adenture to find the treasure and save the family home.  These kids will stop at nothing.  They encounter a mob family, a disturbing humanoid that likes snickers, booby traps, and a piano made of bone that when you hit the wrong note opens a hole in the ground that looks like a bottomless pit.  Once into adventure, the kids begin to lose faith, but as luck would have it, they find the ship.  But will they find the treasure?  and will One-eyed Willie let them have it?  Or will the Fratelli family beat them to it?  You'll just have to watch it and find out.  This movie is great fun for all ages.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Although Michael Ross's critique suggests \\"...sometimes less is not, in fact, more..\\" I would disagree in this case. Jones has created an elegently simple yet deeply evocative collection  of songs. Each is highly enjoyable and best appreciated by turning up the volume to hear the precise but, again, simple work of her sidemen as well as the wonderfully sexy and warm voice of Jones herself. I wish her a long and successful career.
B00004WGAI|4.0|My favorite aspect of this particular adaptation is Timothy Dalton's performance as Rochester. Although it takes a lot of imagination to picture him as the monstrous and ugly Rochester from Bronte's novel, I fould Dalton's performance sufficiently sardonic and broodingly passionate, yet subtle and not overdone. It must have been difficult to find this balance because many of the narrative episodes between Jane and Rochester in the novel are quite melodramatic, such as when Rochester holds out his wrist so Jane can feel his pulse (this was left out of the filmed version). <br />I was unfamiliar with Zelah Clark's work before seeing this film, and her perfomance was very subdued, some might venture a little too subdued. I imagined Jane to be a bit more &quot;firey&quot; like she's described in the book. Clarke's performance of Jane is subtle to the point where Jane is somewhat of a cold fish. Yet the second half of the series sees Clark as Jane smiling more, and acting more like the stubborn and passionate Jane of the novel. I did not find her &quot;plain-ness&quot; distracting because Jane Eyre is described as plain and Quakerish in the novel. <br />This series is a very faithful adaptation of the novel, and it incorporates much from the original narrative that has been left out of other filmed adaptations, such as the infamous Gypsy-scene (Timothy Dalton in Gypsy drag alone makes seeing this film a treat). However, the film does not capture some of the nuances of the original narrative, such as the sense that there is something wrong with Jane and Rochester's relationship other than the existance of Bertha Mason up in the attic. In the novel, Jane has to give Rochester a &quot;cold shoulder&quot; treatment to cool his passion. The film does not emphasize Rochester's problem of seeing Jane as a fantasy creature. However, this did not detract from my enjoyment of the film. I'd recommend this version to anyone who wishes to see the most faithful adaptation of Bronte'snovel that they can find.
B00006IU73|5.0|I first heard the opening track (Blackest Eyes) through a p.a. system while waiting between sets at last years ProgWest 2002. I was floored by the combination of metal guitars and layered, complex melodies and had no idea who the band was. When someone in the crowd (all of whom where collectively 'banging' their heads to the tune) mentioned it was Porcupine Tree, I was shocked.<br />I had listened to a few Porcupine Tree discs a couple of years before and had written them off as progressive, but just another in the line of Pink Floyd rip-offs. I got the disc when I got back home and sure enough there it was. Every track on this disc is above average, but it's really the production values that make it stand out.<br />DO NOT SKIP THIS DISC BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD PORCUPINE TREE BEFORE! I can't stress it enough, this is something different from them.<br />My biggest complaint about today's 'Progressive' Rock scene is that they (the bands) tend to go one way or the other: Progressive Metal (Dream Theater, Symphony X, Pain of Salvation, etc.) or Progressive Ambience (Spock's Beard, Flower Kings, and of course the older Porcupine Tree). The reason In Absentia works is it gives you a little of both, without sacrificing production values.<br />anyway, I think there's something for everyone on this disc, so give it a shot.
B000002H33|5.0|This is a excellent piece of work from Metallica. Although Metallica is not the best metal band ever they are definately the most well-known and widely popular. Now, there are mainly two extremes of people who might dislike this album: people who like ... lite music or \\"nu-metal\\" (slipknot, korn, linkin park) who believe this album sounds like 4 guys pounding mindlessly on their instruments, and the other extreme: metal fans who like Real Heavy Stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Slayer who believe this is a ... light metal album and not nearly as heavy as others. Well, the fact is that they are all wrong. Metallica is a great band and although they are not the heaviest or the best of metal bands they are still good 80's metal. Another great thing about Metallica is their consistency. They have produce quite a few very solid albums and dont really have any really awful ones. Some of the better songs on the album include Disposable Heroes, Sanitarium, and Battery, and of course probably the best song on the album: Master of Puppets. Hetfield's vocals are good and Hammet is excellent on the guitar. Burton is a great drummer and Lars Ulrich was amazing on the the drums. A very talented group. Although I, personally like some havier stuff, like Slayer and Napalm Death I still enjoy Metallica and other lighter metal like this album. Hell, I even like some Classic Rock, like Pink Floyd. And as for those who like bands like Slipknot, Korn, and LInkin Park and think that they are Metalheads, well they are just wrong. So, really, there is no real reason to dislike Metallica. They are one of the most influencial and defining metal Bands of the 80's and this is probly their Best album. I would really reccomend it.<br />And if you like this try:<br />Pantera - a bit heavier but it really wakes you up, kick-... music, plain and simple<br />Megadeth - similar to Metallica formed by Dave Mustaine, also a good band<br />Metal Church - a classic metal band with great songs like Gods of Wrath<br />Anthrax - another member of the Big Four (Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax), great albums like Spreading the Disease and Among the Living<br />Black Sabbath - started it all<br />Black Label Society - Hard and Heavy thrash, featuring one of the best guitarists of all time, black sabbath's guitarist, Zack Wylde

Phillip Pullman on a darker tangent writes a book that I recommended to five parents pre Christmas all teenagers plus parents have all got hooked. This is exciting writing. Not for under 12 year olds but satisfying page turning adventure with mythical and classical undertones. I have read LOR over 50 times and potter books 2-3 times, Pullman will be a yearly read for me.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Crichton endeavoring to create another techno thriller like his superlative Jurassic Park, comes up woefully short with his latest offering, the preposterous Prey.<br />The premise behind the book is nanotechnology, the building of manmade machinery of incredibly small size.<br />Jack Forman a bright fortyish unemployed computer software designer with a biology background is acting as a house husband to his three children.  His wife Julia, who also has a computer background, is a V.P. of Xymos.  Xymos is a company involved in nanotechnology whose major project is being funded by the Department of Defense.  They are developing a super miniature undetectable surveillance camera which can be suspended in the air much like dust, in a remote facility in the Nevada desert.<br />Xymos has been having developmental problems and the D.O.D is threatening to stop the flow of money.  In addition Julia Forman has been acting very bizzarely and neglecting her family.<br />A desperate phone called is placed to Jack Forman by Xymos to help them correct their problems as a paid consultant.  He is flown out to the Nevada laboratory where he learns that a swarm of these mini cameras has escaped the facility.  They have been created using both biological and computer technology originally created by Forman.  Shockingly, the swarm is reproducing and evolving at a rapid pace and showing characteristics of living entities.  This evolution is being nurtured by the killing and consumption of the local animal population with the Xymos technicians as their apparent next targets.<br />This story is too far fetched to be at all plausible.  I'd have to however give Crichton high marks on his imagination, intelligence and the exhaustive research he obviously put in.
B000067CPX|5.0|If You Don't like this, you've never understood what the Peppers are about. This is their marquee album. The one that shows how they've grown through the years. One of the best records they've ever made, and most certainly, the most original.

None of the characters were believable.  The plot was just plain stupid and unbelievable.  Don't waste your money on this best seller.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I really enjoyed this album, though I think I do like the 1996 cast a tad better but the actors have decent voices and I have to give them credit for doing their own singing. My favorite track is &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;.
0553212737|4.0|Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I liked this CD a lot. Rufus has a very mellow voice, and his songs have a lot of personality. I first heard Rufus from his song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; on the Shrek soundtrack.

I'm especially fond of &quot;The Consort&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|First of all, the movie Patton is one of my all time favorites. To say I have viewed this film dozens of times is an understatement. The new two-disc DVD version is simply spectacular. The brilliant color and clarity compared with the VHS tape is like night and day. So what is left to say about this classic winner of eight Academy Awards?Over the years, I have discovered that this movie, as great as it is, is only an introduction to the complexity of Gen George S. Patton Jr. The producers in conjunction with George C. Scott's memorable performance convey only a sample of the many sides of Patton. The film touches on Patton's multi-faceted personality with a fair degree of artistic license. Patton was well versed in history but was he, as the German officer assigned to study him concluded, an \\"anachronism?\\" Patton believed in reincarnation and also that his destiny was \\"to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle.\\" But was he an eccentric? For the novice viewer who, like myself thirty years ago, is enjoying this movie for the first time, it should provide a thirst to learn more about this flamboyant military figure. The older biographies of Martin Blumenson and Ladislas Farago, the latter providing meat for the film, are good starting points. The later work by Carlo D'Este _A Genius for War_ supersedes the rest. The producers of the DVD anticipated this hunger and included an audio essay by Charles M Province (president of the George S Patton Historical Society and author of _The Unknown Patton_). Province's monologue, though factual, sounds adlibbed and unrehersed. It is obvious a prepared script would have benefited this essay.For the Patton afficionado the producer's license with chronology and settings in the film will be evident. For example, the scene where Patton untangles a gridlocked convoy occured in the town square of the city of Avranches, not in an open field as depicted in the film. It must be remembered that General of the Army Omar N. Bradley acted as chief advisor during the filming. Those well versed in this period will recognise there was no love lost between these two men and the Bradley bias must be taken into consideration. A second DVD disc goes behind the scenes of the making of Patton along with a sound track of the film's hauntingly beautiful musical score.Regardless, there is probably no better film biography of an American military figure to grace the big screen than Patton.Every scene is a gem. Even 1960s era American tanks serving both German and American forces (the former with incorrect paint scheme to boot) can be overlooked. Scott is magnificent (even though the real Patton had a much higher squeeky voice) as is Karl Malden as Omar Bradley. If you even remotely enjoyed this film on VHS, run, do not walk, to buy the DVD!  A warning to the new generation of movie lovers, do not prejudge Patton on the film's portrayal. Read D'Este and the film will make a lovely backdrop.chief advisor during the filming.

B00003CXHJ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie which highlights the leadership growth of a young naval officer suddenly thrust into command under incredibly challenging circumstances.  Originally evaluated by his captain as \\"not ready\\" for command, Lt. Tyler is faced with a striking array of challenges.<br />This is a story, primarily, of leadership at sea.  We often forget that our fighting men are often asked to do the nearly impossible, as portrayed in this movie. I have seen just about every submarine movie around, and in my opinion this one compares favorably with \\"The Enemy Below,\\" \\"Das Boot,\\" \\"Run Silent Run Deep\\" and other greats.  It is far more watchable than \\"Das Boot\\"--U-571 does not have any of the dull, draggy interludes that punctuate \\"Das Boot\\" (and most other European movies).  The storyline is brisk, the acting is crisp and authentic, and the story grabs you from the very first moments.  This is a great movie.<br />This movie has wonderful sound effects.  The visuals are utterly real--the viewer feels transported into an old WW2 vintage submarine, and from this realizes an appreciation for the heroism of the men who fought a war inside these steel tin cans.<br />Some of our European friends are bitter because this story is about the US Navy mounting a mission to capture a German enigma machine.  While it is true that the Brits did more of this than did America (after all, they were in the war longer, and the US Navy had to fight two wars at once) it is also true that the US Navy did capture an enigma machine during the war, through heroism and competence.  There is nothing amiss here by virtue of the movie being about Americans.<br />Put aside your prejudices and enjoy this movie!  It is a story of leadership and bravery, not just a \\"shoot-em-up.\\"  Watching Lt. Tyler mature into a superb submarine skipper and gain the respect of his crew is really what this story is about--and a great story it is.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I liked pop, I was a fan of Christina. I have grown up and matured, and don't really like pop now..and I am so glad that Christina has matured musically! I was skeptical about the whole &quot;Dirrty&quot; thing and wasn't going to buy this album, but realized that her image is not important. She is very talented and shows it on this album, which is much better than her first album. She wrote almost all of the songs which impressed me. My favorites are &quot;Soar&quot; which is just so beautiful, make me wanna cry. &quot;Loving me 4 me&quot; is one of my favs, I loved it from the first time I heard it, its just a good song. If you are thinking about buying this CD, then GO!! It is definately worth it.
B000009EAD|5.0|This is considered the LP that opened the band up to a wider audience in the USA. How anyone could have passed up The Dark Saga, is beyond me?! Along with the killer Iced earth artwork that all fans have come to love, you get the most important thing of all: the band! If you look up power/melodic metal in the dictionary, I think there should be a pic of Iced Earth there as an explanation. Their 1st two LP's were good, but thank the God Of power metal (and Jon of Iced Earth!) for finding Matt Barlow. This guy is Bruce Dickinson with a splash of Rob Halford, added in with his own unique style. A superb voice with a range that stands up there with many other power metal acts: Blind Guardian, Iron Maiden, Rhapsody, Helloween, you name it, he can wail with the best of them, and still sing melodic power ballads to boot! There's not one song on Something wicked that won't make you run and buy everything else this band has to offer. I would tell you to buy 'Days of Purgatory' after this, to hear Matt sing all the earlier stuff when he wasn't in the band on the 1st two LP's. The sound on that one and all Iced Earth CD's are killer production sound. Enjoy this one and play it LOUD! ***** 5 STAR ICED RATING! Cheers from Scraggy's Tomb!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|having heard lots of positive buzz about this CD, i listened to it at borders.  i quickly found myself frantically skipping through the tracks, trying to find a single one that did not make me want to egg the cars of the producers who created this monstrosity.<br />buy the beu sisters' CD instead.  you'll be glad you did.  tatu = p.u.
B00002Z88D|1.0|My only question is, \\"What were Metallica thinking?!\\" As if it's not bad enough they have massive numbers of fans questioning whether they sold out or not on Load&ReLoad, they cheat the fans by putting out another boring batch of cover tunes, then try and pull off a live two-disc set with an orchestra behind songs like Battery????!... You've got to be kidding me. The money went to these guys heads like booze does to an alcoholic. It is so sad to see a band that put out the material they did when Cliff Burton was living, go down the road they've chosen. Even Jason Newsted is flogging them in the press, downgrading their ability to be heavy, and he left and is in Voivod now! I don't blame him. A zero rating, and the without a doubt the most low point in this band's career ... but they would say, \\"Hey, look at all the money we made.\\" Only they wouldn't say that to the most important people they lost site of: THE FANS. I hope they can turn themselves around. If anything, buy this and store it away for when it's out of print, you can sell it and make some money to buy some real music that's out there. ...Get real Lars, you're set for life, keep putting out sellouts and you'll be fine. Go back to the real Metallica sound and grow up.

B00003CWN3|5.0|This story is a story that needed to be made into a movie. The movie is made and written by a lesbian. Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank shine in this movie. Swank manages not to portray a man, but a woman passing for a man. Swank allows her character to show the bravado, pain and courage it took for Brandon to be who he was. He is sweet and not agressive, completely unlike the boys in town. This movie doesn't pull punches when it comes to the sex or the violence in this story. It can be hard to take as I was crying in the end, but it is ultimately important to show how hate can be so destructive.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I don't understand the reviews. I don't understand why it did so bad in theatres, period! &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; has style and action, with great acting and story. It's creative, it's stunning and it's not bad. My friend was actually going to be in the movie (a very small part) but when they changed the script around, his part was taken out (but he got the money!) I thought this movie was going to flop and be terrible but I thought wrong. It's no Lord of the Rings but it's better than the Terminator. Trust me, this movie is not just pure eye candy. This film is eye-popping!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Along the same alley as Saving Private Ryan this DVD series is a must for everyone. I think any effort to try and teach people the sacrifices of war and the realities should be reason enough to buy. I'm more into the Vietnam War and bought this because I loved the way Saving Private Ryan was done and I am thrilled with this purchase. Trying to follow WWII and the history and all the battles is hard and complex and this mini-series makes it alot easier. You follow Easy Company through there whole journey of War and you even get the emotions and effects of War not just shoot um up and kill em stuff. I would like to see Hanks and Spielberg do more of these kinds of films so people would see the sacrifices of many Americans for there freedom.
006097625X|5.0|My brother was interested in comics. My brother loves to draw comics.  My brother made me promise to read this book.  I am now interested in comics.  I now love to write comics.  This book changed my life and gave me a new hobby.  Too bad every subject in life couldn't be put in Scott McCloud's perspective.  WOW!!!
0060977493|2.0|This book has amazing metaphors and the ability to help the adult reader remember what it used to be like to think as a child. That being said, I found this book extremely difficult to read. The &quot;plot&quot;, such as it is, continually and abruptly moves from one time frame to another. I understand the &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; concept, but some streams are very difficult to flow with and follow. Also, the author uses so many terms from India that this reader wished for a glossary in the back in order to understand what was being described. For someone who is not familiar with East Indian culture, it was very difficult to make sense of just what the author was refering to in many passages. I read for enjoyment and this book was just too impressionistic to be an enjoyable read.
0316666343|4.0|My first review:<br />Having given &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; as a Christmas gift to a friend, I thought I should pick it up myself to see why NPR named this book among the best of 2002.  While this type of novel is not normally my cup of tea, it left me with enough questions regarding the immortality of the soul and the meaning of personal identity that, after finishing, I started skimming through some of my old college Greek philosophy tomes.<br />Where this novel certainly succeeds is in concept.  Ms. Sebold spins a modern version of the soul's afterlife that challenges Dante's and the &quot;Our Town&quot; vision of &quot;heaven&quot;.  While some of the ideas have been seen before (i.e. a transient soul inhabiting a living person's body), the personal heaven of omniscient and dead (mostly) Miss Salmon is intriguing.  I suppose it was only a matter of time before &quot;Our Own Personal Heaven&quot; hit the mainstream with a best seller.<br />In execution, Ms. Sebold has her hits and misses.  The grandmother is wonderfully perceptive and intuitive, as only a fictional character can be.  The parents are haunted characters, literally, and the mother's disengagement and abandonment is fascinating psychology.  But the sister is a puzzle, and the friend who channels the dead is unconvincing.<br />In sum, this optimistic novel is a good read, even if painfully sentimental at times.  I finished it in two sittings, so I suppose I can say that even for the book's faults, this novel is engrossing and thought-provoking, even as wish fulfillment at it's finest.  Recommended, particularly to the nurturing, sensitive reader.
B00004HYLF|5.0|This album is awesome.  How can you go wrong with the likes of Chick Corea, Lenny White, Stanley Clarke, and Al DiMeola on ONE ALBUM PLAYING TOGETHER?  They are awesome alone in their own right, but when they play together they make some of the most grinding and beautiful jazz fusion I have ever heard.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|While I can't deny the sappiness, this movie is one I have watched over and over.  Drew Barrymore is enduring as always.  No matter how many times I have seen it, I find myself tearing up at the end.

0671775308|5.0|This book, and its successor, The Millionaire Mind, changed my life. I am a type-B person who is smart enough -- and talented enough -- to make an okay-living but I know I'll never bring home the big bucks because I like leisure activities and time with my family too much. I am married to a man with the same outlook. Reading this book made me realize that I could build wealth by passive means rather than active (i.e. earning a big salary.) Even an ordinary person can become financially stable -- even very wealthy -- by following the basic living rules that your parents taught you (or should have taught you.) Far more than a book about money, this is really a book about values and how you live your life. <br />The book should really be titled \\"Everything Your Mom Taught You (or Should Have Taught You) is Right.\\" If you follow all the rules laid out in this book, you will never be poor (except for some disaster that you have no control over, but in that case you'd be poor no matter what you did.) The rules are the ones that Americans used to live by before the coming of the 60s and 70s and the \\"turn on, tune out\\" generation's destructive, infantile philosophy. <br />These rules are: 1.) Complete at least high school (a college degree is better, but not necessary. 2.) Marry a hardworking reliable spouse, not a flake, and stay married. (Advice is good for both sexes -- divorce is a huge wealth-killer). 3.) Live below your means, save and invest the left-over money. 4.) Buy good quality stuff, not trendy \\"stuff\\"  that goes out of style or falls apart after a few years, and keep it for a long time. 5.) Buy used, good quality stuff rather than new, poorly made junk for the same price. 6.) Don't do stuff that harms your health, like substance abuse and promiscuous sex. 7.) Don't buy on credit. Pay off your credit cards every month and save up for what you want rather than financing it at 18 percent interest. 8.) Realize that excessive consumerism is really another word forslavery. It really is better to have a couple hundred thousand dollars in the bank and be able to sleep at night than to have the latest model luxury car and the biggest house, and not be able to sleep at night. <br />...
B000069CWE|4.0|Reanimation is a remix CD to Linkin Park's multi-platinum CD Hybrid Theory. Not only are the titles to the tracks unique, but the songs are as well. Linkin Park had various different DJs redo their songs, which keeps gives each song a diverse taste.  <br />But what made this album great was that Linkin Park was not afraid to take that step into the rap genre, while still keeping respect in the rock community. Give this CD a try! You won't regret it.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|...He is correct in saying the film is great for history buffs and that is what I am (BA-Hist).  This film depicts history.  It is an inside look at Nazi Germany.  Turn off the lights when you watch it and you will think you have a front row seat at a Nuremburg rally.  It may have been produced as propaganda but what it is now is nothing short of historical documentation, regardless of how the images were woven together.<br />It has great footage and shows all of the regular Nazi Nuts and ones you have never seen or heard before.  I loved being able to listen to them in German with subtitles instead of having a narrator. You can have that too.  I bought the Special Edition DVD. The quality of this black and white film is the best I have ever seen.  Special features include English subtitles and voice-over narration (all optional).  <br />Leni did not hire Industrial Light and Magic to insert millions of regimented Nazi followers.  They are the real thing.  The Nazi movement clearly stirred nationalistic fervor.  You cannot deny the images. They speak for themselves.  The German people were caught up in a movement of incredible proportions and this movie shows you what it was like in the early years of the Third Reich.  Germans killed millions and millions of Germans died in WW II.  This movie will give you a very good idea of what the Allied forces were fighting against.
B000060K4O|5.0|After finally watching it all the way, I have realized that the WS is not that bad on here. Like the title of this reviews says, it's a great movie and one that I have always liked. The Final Verdict that has been appealed from last time: I would buy it, but if you're still skeptical or will have the same problems like I did have, then rent it first and see what you think.
B00005JLRR|5.0|Being a Trekkie, and holding The Next Generation as my favorite of the five series', of course I loved it.  But not just Trekkies would enjoy this movie.<br />Nemesis has a condensed plotline that isn't stretched with all-over-the-place extra details to confuse you.  It's plot, though new twists are added, follows a few select themes.  Yet, it is still deep and entwining.  <br />I found myself on the edge of my seat the entire time.  I was excited, worried, anxious, happy, sad, hopeful... the whole she-bang.  It seems that the first two reviews I saw on this page were negative.  I, however, absolutely LOVED this movie.  That may be my Trekkie genetics (it's a family thing), but I seem to be far from the only ohne, Trekkie or not, to really like the film.<br />I think it's definitely worth it.  I am familiar with the characters bcause of my long-time addiction to the television series, but a lack of familiarity wouldn't, in my opinion, detract from the enjoyment.  <br />There were, of course, a few things that could have been better.  But, overall, I think it was a wonderful film.<br />I'll stop here because if I continue, the way I say it may not get across without basically repeating that which I have already stated.  I find it hard to describe it, really, but I really loved this movie and I think that it is definitely worth every bit of time spent in its viewing.
B00000K0E5|5.0|First off, I just want to say that I love this movie! It is my favorite Bond film, (even though this was the first one I had seen. I have not seen any of the other ones). The DVD menu is very cool. I also loved the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It had to be one of my favorite N64 games. I would play it a lot. The Final Verdict: Buy.

True, you should chase and reach your dreams, but must they be found in such a uninspirational and dull way? There are some interesting concepts but they are also equally confusing. Due to the mass hype and praise of this book, i read it a second time - hoping to grasp something i missed...but i just felt bored and wished i hadnt spent valuable time of my life reading this...maybe this is a revolutionary book for some but i just didn't like or believe in the unrealistic and often at times ridiculous storyline

B00006CXXU|5.0|Despite the very provocative new image, and the inevitably new sound that comes along with it, Christina's music, talent and soul shines in her latest outing 'Stripped'. This pressing plays for about a hefty 78 minutes, packed with dark ballads, provocative uptempos/r&b, blues, and tinges of rock, though a bit overcooked sometimes, it still manages to entertain. If they would just remove the 2 useless interludes (Primer Amor, Loves Embrace). The album opens with Stripped intro, a self declaration of breaking the mold, over driven piano beats, then follows the girl power trip hop Can't Hold us down w/ Lil' Kim. Walk away is a lovely ballad, however the latter is incessantly long. The rock numbers Fighter and Make over are things to definitely wake you up. Ballads like Beautiful, The Voice Within and Keep On Singing My Song, Soar, Cruz are sure to uplift and if not, give you a sense of security. The ballads are the crowning glory of this album, it brings you to a place of warmth and hope that no despair can chill. There are a lot of styles here too Latin, 70's soul, rock, blues, r&b, stripped can be everyone's cup of tea.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I've watched this movie three times now. It never ceases to grab me and I'm not sure why. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance maybe. It's beautifully strange, filled with pain and innocence. Maybe the story, because I'm constantly trying to figure it out. Maybe the music, that is so in tune with the story. Or maybe it's the effect it had on me when it ends, and they show all the people Donnie touched, the looks each has on their face. I dont' know. I can't explain it.<BR>Mary K
0425170349|5.0|Having never really read a Tom Clancy novel before, I wasn't quite prepared for the impact that this book had on me. As a lover of books that are are fast paced, I was richly rewarded with 'Rainbow Six'<BR>The basic storyline is almost Bond-like in its appeal. Bunch of wierdos trying to wipe out the human population on the planet. Its very detailed and compelling though, with all of its sub storylines incredably addictive, leading up to the grand finale in the Amazon jungle. The action sequences are detailed and very, very tense and exciting.<BR>But the main drawcard for this book is the charactars. There is the boss, John Clark, who spearheads an elite group of special forces troops. It is these characters that make Rainbow Six magic. The main theme of this book is the bond between all the soldiers who have to battle their way around the globe to stop the forces of evil. There is a real feeling of friendship and trust in this book, which is what I think Tom Clancy was looking for.<BR>You really have to give credit to mister Clancy, he's been in this buisness for a while now, but he still has that hunger to give the reader a book to remember. <BR>Well done Tom, looking forward to meeting the Rainbow troops in another adrenilin pumped book.
B00005ARDC|2.0|This album earns two stars for a brilliant attempt at sounding exactly like The Jesus and Mary Chain.  This album only gets two stars because if I wanted to listen to The Jesus and Mary Chain, I'd do just that.  Homage to your influence is one thing, becoming them is another.  Honestly, look at the cover photo of this album and compare it to the inside liner photo in the Jesus and Mary Chain's cd \\"Honey's Dead\\".

When Soundgarden's Chris Cornell comes together with the powerhouse behind Rage Against The Machine - Tim Commerford (bass), Brad Wilk (drums), and Tom Morello (guitars) - you know you're not in for a peaceful hour. Even minus the political clout and personality of Zack de la Rocha, this is rock on an epic Led Zeppelin scale. In other words, how it's meant to be.<br />Fears that this would be an ego-fuelled jaunt for spent forces are thankfully unfounded. CVs as accomplished as these four would be hard to find if you trawled the rock archive looking for suitable applicants. The unrivalled voice of the grunge generation and a band that dealt in pure rage long before Fred Durst decided to break stuff sounds mouth-watering on paper. It doesn't disappoint. <br />There's pretty much everything you would hope for from Cornell in terms of lyrics - metaphors for religious grandeur, an obsession with the power of the elements, finding yourself rock bottom - and his voice still shudders with unsurpassable soul and depth. Morello has obviously been dying to treat us to his latest nimble fretwork and duly obliges with a real axe masterclass, while Commerford and Wilk construct a rumbling tsunami track after track.<br />As a whole, 'Audioslave' is the type of album that prowls menacingly and requires maximum volume at all times. Opener 'Cochise' sets the tone immediately with some almighty riffs and Cornell gives his vocal chords a long-overdue workout. 'Show Me How To Live' and 'Gasoline' are trademark Rage Against Machine, while 'What You Are' has a brooding force and 'Set If Off' is a primeval beast.<br />If Zep were a Rolls Royce then Audioslave are a top of the range gleaming Mercedes Benz with producer Rick Rubin as the chauffeur. These are men with a passion for perfection, making this record tighter than Robert Plant's leathers. Its sheer velocity bucks current trends of lo-fi production, meaning it'll be construed as unfashionable but at the same time those who've been crying out for such a polished rock album will be overjoyed.<br />Whether this is a one-off or the start of a beautiful relationship, Audioslave have dwarfed any rock uprising of the past few years to become the first truly great rock band of the 21st century.
B00003CXB7|4.0|M*A*S*H is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time.  There are laughs, there are sighs, there is excitement, there are cries.  Just about everything's superb.  The DVD is also superb.  I wish I could give it ****1/2, but oh well!
B000005Z0G|4.0|Now 2Pac (that's Tupac Shakur) has been on a roll recently. After hooking up with crossover success Digital Underground, he not only has managed a pretty good solo career, he's broken into film, doing a not at all bad turn in both Juice and John Singleton's recent Poetic Justice. <br />2Pac's only real bumpy moment came last year when he became the center of the seemingly annual censorhip debates surrounding hip hop. He was not only sued by the widow of a cop who was killed by some kid who had 2Pac's first album, 2Pacalypse Now, in his car (along with George Michael's album and a bunch of other pop albums) but he became the whipping boy of the esteemed Dan Quayle, then vice-president of these here United States. <br />In some ways, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. is his reply to his critics. It's a virtual diatribe against Dan Quayle and censorship and it's much, much, much harder than the sometimes too tepid 2Pacalypse Now. <br />And that's okay by me, because it's a much better album. Of course, I like that old style Bomb Squad sound. And, of course, a good scritch-scratch over some PE whine and nice bass does it for me almost every time. So I might be biased. On the other hand, it is all about lyrics and 2Pac comes correct on this tip as well. <br />So, the verdict? It's uneven but when it's on, it's on. <br />I think he needs to stop that processing his voice thing and he could do with fewer or shorter interludes. But even if he keeps all that along with the rest of the stuff he did on this album, his third effort will be one phat album. And if he drops the voice and the interludes, it might even be phat+. <br />Give \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me,\\" \\"Last Wordz,\\" and \\"Souljah's Revenge\\" a good listen. They're worth the price of admission, anyway. The album is pretty dope. Not a classic, but he's on his way. Next week, when you're picking up De La and Snoop, pick up this not-quite-new effort as well.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Stanley Kubrick has done it again.  DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB (well, that's quite a long title) is a superb example of American filmmaking, and it's possibly the greatest comedy ever.  Peter Sellers is really funny, and George C. Scott is great, while we also have Slim Pickens and more famous people (we also get a look at a young James Earl Jones).  It's just a great film, and the black & white shade gives a kind of \\"eerie\\" feeling.  It's just a great movie.  It's flawless! (although the ending happens a little quick, but...)
6305696071|3.0|No one with such an enormous mouth could reasonably be called &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.<br />Also, for those of you who think she's really hot -- remember that a body double was used in the early scene in which her character dresses.<br />But the story is entertaining enough; it's a harmless movie.
B000067FP7|4.0|Without a doubt, GREMLINS is a classic, and if you ask why, it's just sooooooo much fun!  The gremlins are neat (if not somewhat unbelievable), the story's okay, the music is great (although annoying at times), and with writing by Chris Columbus, producing by Steven Spielberg, and directing by Joe Dante, it's a little hard to go wrong.  It's also a great family film or for Halloween.  Definately worth a rent!
B00007BH5C|5.0|After his Academy Award win for The Fellowship of the Ring, Howard Shore returns to score the sequel, The Two Towers. This is just as good as Fellowship, if not better. Some of the themes from the last soundtrack are reused, but the majority of the music contains new themes, which are just as good. A new element used in the music for this soundtrack is a handanger, which is a Norwegian fiddle used for the Rohan theme. This thematic material can be found in &quot;The Riders of Rohan&quot;, &quot;The King of the Golden Hall&quot;, &quot;Helm's Deep&quot;, and &quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot;. The powerful chorus and mighty percussion that made the first score so great is featured in &quot;The Passage of the Marshes&quot;, &quot;Helm's Deep&quot;, &quot;The Hornburg&quot;, &quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot;, and &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;. As Enya was used in the first soundtrack, Shore employs several soloists for this one, such as Isabel Bayrakdarian in &quot;Evenstar&quot;, Shelia Chandra in &quot;Breath of Life&quot;, Elizabeth Fraser in &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;, Ben Del Maestro in &quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot; and &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;, and Emiliana Torrini singing &quot;Gollum's Song&quot;. The Fellowship theme returns in &quot;The Uruk-hai&quot; and the Hobbit theme returns in &quot;Samwise the Brave&quot;. A major highlight of the album is &quot;Helm's Deep&quot;, &quot;The Hornburg&quot;, &quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot;, and &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot; with a powerful chorus, brass fanfares, and booming percussion. Some other new material for Gollum can be found in &quot;The Taming of Smeagol&quot;, &quot;The Forbidden Pool&quot;, and &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; with a cimbalom being used for his sound. As you have probably guessed by now, this is definitely a score worth getting at all costs. If you liked Fellowship, you will equally enjoy this. I think this will win the Academy Award this year for best score, as Fellowship did. Very impressive!
0783225857|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a classic, a masterpiece, and one of the best films of the sixties.  Gregory Peck is at his best here, and although his character is the star, the film is told through the eyes of his two children.  It's simply a great film.  You should definately rent it.  Never mind.  BUY IT.
B000002IGV|3.0|With their abrasive attitude, big hair, colorful style and creative looking makeup, these guys were one of the best bands of their day - true metal masters in '84.  What ever happened to 'em?  As if Twisted Sister's songs weren't crazy enough, they made hilarious videos that really stuck it to parents everywhere!!  I'd hate to be Dee Snider's dad!!  Remember the part when the little kid started spinning around wildly and suddenly transformed into Dee!!  Technology at its finest, back in '84!!<br />Well, if you dig transcendent rock bands that have more to offer than just partyin' type lyrics, this is the band for you.  These guys stood up against society when it was un-hip to do so.  Also, they ushered in a new era of bands like Aerosmith and Bon Jovi.  Thanks for your inspiration, Dee!!!!<br />HOPE YA' LIKE IT!!!
6304708491|5.0|Film snobbery would seem to dictate that &quot;Help&quot; is somehow inferior to its predecessor film, &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot;  But as usual, this is hardly the case. \\"Help\\" succeeds where \\"Night\\" fails for one very important reason; it has a plot.  A send up the James Bond movies, it provides a stunning variety of locations and exquisite production design.  The set for the boys' home in London was a stroke of pure comic and cinematic genius; four doors leading into one spacious room with no walls, just areas defined by each of the fictional Fab Four's eccentric tastes.   Hopefully the reason that the DVD is currently out of production is because a new issue, comparable to the extras-stuffed, \\"Night\\" will soon be issued.
B000002AGN|3.0|It doesn't swing enough. One major question, and I know I might be a little bit disliked by a few for this: why Jazz - the greatest American contribution to music, so much admired by us non-swinging Europeans, why Jazz has not earned yet a separate category in Amazon's music compartment but it is thrown into \\"popular music\\" all-embracing basket ?. Is it really so popular, so easy to follow ? Do John Coltrane and Shakira go together in musical esthetics ? I do know a few European online stores that divide their musical offering among a/popular, b/classical, c/jazz. And they seem closer to the you know what.<BR>Just a reflection.<br />Plus: a response for Mark.<BR>Mark, you wrote: \\"You must remember that jazz would not exist if not for white music as much as it would for black music. If you knew anything at all about the history of this music, you would know damn well that it was born out of the mixture of Western music and the music of the slaves. Jazz is the sound of America not because it is black or white, but because it is everything. Jazz has grown from its beginnings to include the music of the Cajun peoples, the black slaves, the Irish immigrants, the Italians...even the music of Jewish people as Benny Goodman included Klezmer sounds in his repertoire. \\"<br />Excuse me Mark, but my knowledge about facts of jazz is contrary to this opinion (let's separate opinions from facts, as you said). Jazz was born and created by black people in America - now listen - on instruments that were an invention of other people (piano and trumpet and guitar were invented in Europe, saxophone in America, not important for merits, just to clarify the facts). This meeting of black people and their rythm genius and their slavery induced art of blues - with above mentioned instruments could have happened (at the time when this happened) only in America. And so it did. But telling us - jazz fans - that jazz is a music created by everybody out there, an amalgam of all-embracing creativegenius, is just contrary to the facts, Mark. Black Americans created jazz. Perhaps viewing this from afar, from Europe, gives a better glimpse.
B00005JKED|3.0|C'mon people if denzel deserved an oscar for this performance then he should have many more because this performance wasn't even his 10th best. There is no sublety to the acting. Just a lot of yelling, screaming, spitting and mugging. I was shocked that so many seem so impressed.    Training day is about a once good cop gone bad, real bad. Ethan hawk plays the unsuspecting rookie who is about to have a life changing experience. He finds his tutor to be violent, corrupt to the core and even deadly. Plant some evidence to make a case? No problem. Skim a little drug money off the top? No problem there either but the real turning point in the movie is when the denzel character executes a drug dealer. He's just scum anyway was the rationalization. Keep in mind this is all happening on a rookie's first day as a narc! No attempt to work him in gradually into this corrupt world. Eventually(of course) the young cop rebels against these injustices and almost loses his life becuase of what he knows. Then he turns on his teacher     The plot of the film seems too politically motivated and forced. You have this psychopathic bad guy black cop and the well meaning young white cop with unrealistic ideals. Watching this film you may be lead to believe that entire police forces are corrupt and all the men sitting in prison are just victims of corruption. Yeah right.     When the hawk's character turns on his teacher and tries to bring him to justice the movie has a chance to shine. It doesn't. You have the typical struggle and an ending that is dumber than you can believe. Here is hawk's character holding a gun on denzel in the street. A large crowd of neighborhood people are around the scence now and almost all of them are black. They reject denzel's pleas to help one of their own because of what he has done to their community. He screams that he will \\"make a case\\" against all of them and there is that infamous line \\"I'm the police, you just live here.\\" The end comes when hawk's character returns home dejected that all he dreamed of and all his ideals are lost. The crooked denzel cop meets his end when an assasination squad with automatic weapons come upon him and fire at his car. In an idiotic scene right out of the godfather denzel, just like sonny corelone emerges from his vehicle and dies only after another barrage of bullets riddle his body. Aside from the unrealistic possibility that a guy with 150 bullets in him could get out of a car and stand, that death scence represents the most horrible acting i have ever seen out of denzel washington with his mouth slung open and his final stagger he looks more drunk than dying. Horrible.    Actually it is ethan hawk who has the challenging role and he pulls it off fairly well. He has to begin the film as an idealistic nervous cop who gradually becomes disappionted, disgusted, outraged and then enraged. In the end his whole life is shattered his career, all his dreams. A point that isn't even given 2 minutes time. It takes a more mercurial performance to play that part.    Over all training day is a mediocre film with decent acting, decent action and a flawed plot. The end was a huge disappointment.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Ok, let me adress my soapbox for a second.  For everyone saying that Jared Leto is so original in his songwriting and that 30STM is a brand new concept, that is not true.  Deadsy did it far before them. *steps off soapbox*<BR>Ok, with that out of the way, I do love this cd. I know I said that this band may not completely original, but in this case it doesn't matter because the product is good enough and has enough differences for me to appreciate it.  I do recommend checking Deadsy out if you like this cd, though.  Now all that I can hope for is a Deadsy/30 Seconds to Mars tour!
B00006JIA4|3.0|Note the name of this compilation of songs. \\"Queens greatest hits\\". Not the best of, or queen stuff or something like that. The first 2 Cds are great but the third is pure rubbish! Maybe it is because the 3rd is severely wanting that they felt the need to combine it with the other two. What is the point? You probably already own at least GH one or two or maybe \\"classic queen\\" but there is no real reason to own GH3. Don't buy it!    Queen is one of my all time favorite rock bands and i own 2/3 of all their albums. I persoanlly think it is an abomination that songs performed by other people would make a so called queen CD. If somebody wants to do a queen tribute Cd using various artists much like they did with elton john's songs it would be great. But to throw these songs onto queen greatest hits CD? It's obvious that this is just a way to keep the wheel greased. That maybe; probably; a wycliff jean, david bowie, elton john or george micheal fan will snap this up just because they appear on it. I just think it harms the queen legacy.    I also object to using marginally popular solo efforts on a GH CD. Including freedie's or brian's solo material just cheapens evertything. The solo stuff just isn't the same, isn't as good. Sorry.     Want to experience queen? Than buy the first album \\"Queen\\". Then buy \\"Queen 2\\" and then maybe \\"Night at the opera\\". Experience one of rock's great bands the way you should.
B00005ATQH|2.0|I'll just say right off, Lolita is my favorite book, and what I love most about it are the parts that could not in any way be translated into movie form, so I went into this movie with reservations. <BR>I could never imagine liking the book and this movie; you'd have to be able to completely separate them in your mind. Kubrick, using Nabokov's screenplay, does a great job with the humor of the book; unfortunately, he feels the need to amplify it, maybe because so much of the book has to be left out. The best thing, in my opinion, about the book is its use of language; it uses such beautiful, intricate, poetic language to describe such deplorable things, and makes it all funny, too. The language, symbolism, allusions and puns Nabokov uses could never be brought to the screen, and if you've lost that, you've lost half the book. You're left with a fascinating, sensational plot that in the novel is just the starting point; you can read it just for the story, but you'll have missed a lot.<br />Another problem is the casting. Sue Lyon is too old, too movie-ish, and too obviously attractive. James Mason is too...James Mason-y. Peter Sellers gives an excellent performance; unfortunately, his Quilty is not in any way related to the Quilty of the book. The one exception is Shelley Winters, who is funny, pathetic, annoying, and ultimately tragic as Charlotte Haze- dead on.<BR>If you want to see an interesting, well done, well-acted movie, then by all means see Stanley Kubrick's version of Lolita. If you want all that scandal and story mixed with unbelieveable mastery of language and humor, then buy a copy of the book.
6300183211|5.0|..Said Al Pacino. This is one of the best movies ever! Pacino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who is addicted to drugs on the streets of Miami. He then gets involved with gangsters who want to kill him. He always liked the American Dream: with a Vengeance. The best crime movie ever! 4 Stars!
6305841861|5.0|A mixture of comedy and horror. The concept is scary and the scenes are hilarious. I own all three evil dead movies, but this one is my favorite. Directed by the same guy who directed Spiderman, Sam Raimi.
6302256615|5.0|I liked this movie for 2 reasons. 1 because of the action and the surfing. And 2 because of the acting between Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. Reeves plays an FBI agent who teams with surfers who rob banks. Swayze plays Bodhi, Reeves' new friend and the leader of the gang. Gary Busey and John C. McGinley were also great in the movie. I give it 3 1/2 stars. It was just great.
B000005HN6|5.0|The reason i liked opeth's &quot;orchid&quot; so much, was the fact that this guys, not only could  play their instruments, fast and dark  but also  melodic, beatifull as well as very emotional... Sounding sometimes like, pink floyd,hendrix... Even simon&amp;garkfunkel, which  to me is tottaly awsome. Buy it now !
B00000490M|5.0|Ralph Macchio had just finished playing Johnny Cade in &quot;The Outsiders&quot; also another great movie and decided to play Daniel in The Karate Kid. A story of a teen who arrives in California and as soon as he meets a new girlfriend, the leader of &quot;The Cobras&quot;, a karate &quot;dojo&quot;, gets into a fight with Daniel. An instructor named Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) teaches Daniel the secrets of Karate and self-confidence and self-defense after seeing him getting beat up by the Cobras after a prank Daniel did. This movie is the best martial arts movie of all time. See my review about &quot;Crossroads&quot; also starring Ralph Macchio.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I admit at first I was hesitating to buying 'Stripped' since her last one [was bad] but I bought it anyway and I am glad. Because it is truly one of the best CD's of 2002 and she is showing us she is not a little girl anymore and it's obivous from her lyrics and quite frankly 'Stripped' was worth the wait.
6302298695|5.0|Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding, Jr. star in John Singleton's first story of three South Central adults: one a drug dealer; one looking for a football scholarship; and the other looking for better life, wondering if he will be a daddy. This movie is WAY too intense for younger children. If you never seen this yet, see it, you'll just love it! 4 Stars!
B00002Z88D|4.0|Metallica, one of the greatest metal bands ever, going head to head with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Mouthwatering prospect, which is matched by this superb double cd package. <BR>Hetfields singing is nigh on perfect, by far the best singing he's done on any Metallica album, Hammett is his usual stupendous self, and Ulrich is inspired and creative even during quiet passages. The orchestra combine brilliantly in places, the best tracks being Bleeding Me, Wherever I May Roam, Outlaw Torn, Nothing Else Matters (adds a real sinister tone), For Whom The Bell Tolls, and Fuel. But in other places the orchestra are either struggling to keep up with Metallica, or overpowering them with their rich sound ie- Battery, Call of Ktulu, Master of Puppets. But overall, this is a fantastic package worth every damn penny uve got.
630280082X|5.0|I liked the music, too. Ralph Macchio and Joe Seneca are great as a team playing guitars. This is without a doubt, one of the best films of 1986. I liked when Joe Seneca was calling Ralph Macchio &quot;Mr. Janitor Man&quot; and when he said &quot;you don't play no harp, you don't get no p--sy.&quot;. The acting was great, so was the music. An A+!

0679411585|5.0|This book is an excellent account of what happened at X-ray and Albany.  I read the book and watched the movie, in that order, and feel the movie doesn't really do the book justice (nor did it depict the chaos near LZ Albany).  The movie is quite entertaining, but if you want a full helping of up-front, this-is-how-it-is military history, dig in to the book.  I found it just as captivating as any book I've ever read.

B00005R87Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I've always been a car kinda guy, and just loved all the stunts that were involved in making this film.  It was also a real eye-opener to see the \\"underground\\" car racing world.
B00006CXXU|5.0|After seeing Christina performing a medley of Impossible & Beautiful on the AMA that is superb and amazing, I decided to pick up her \\"Stripped\\". I really made a right choice in pickin up her sophomore LP. \\"Stripped\\" is really a great album wit some production by Linda Perry and the very talented Alicia Keys. Christina co-written all her lyrics except for a few songs in here.<br />Some of my favorites tracks from Stripped includes Can't Hold Us Down featuring Lil' Kim which is a tight collaboration and has a catchy hook. Walk Away sounds like somethin Alicia Keys would do that sounds very soft and peaceful. Fighter sounds kinda like Dirrty, an upbeat track and has a kick of some rock element. Infatuation is the earliest track that she did in the past, a catchy R&B track that sounds more like stuff from her debut album. Impossible is probably one of the best songs on the album, it's produced by one of my favorite singer Alicia Keys, Alicia does the background piano in here and the vocal really flows well. Beautiful is another beautiful track produced by Linda Perry, the second single from the album and also one of the best from the album, the live performance of Impossible & Beautiful is flawless, definitely one the best performances on AMA. I'm OK is also one of the best from the album, the most personal song to Christina which is about family violence, she pours her soul and feeling into the song, a song that is able to touch our emotion, a song that can make a person feels emotionally sad.<br />This album is more up close and personal to Christina and it's overall betta that her debut album. Clockin at over 77minutes, this is also a long album cuz there's a long interval of time between her debut LP and Sophomore LP. Pick up \\"Stripped\\" today and you will not regret it, it's really Christina at her best. An album that shows us how the girl we used to know had evolved into a real woman.
B0000048CP|5.0|In 1983, a young man named Quorthon hauled his 12w amplifier, drum machine and four-track down to the basement and recorded the first of what would come to be enigmatic, raw and harsh-sounding, blasting metal. Four years later, he reached his artistic peak with an album that combines acerbic, intense riffing with the epic song structures and neoclassical leanings of the more progressive heavy metal of the day. Melodic composition underlies each song, producing a narrative of sound that eventually states itself in final form, but not after some fireworks and rough, aggressive riffing that is reminiscent of Slayer \\"Reign in Blood.\\" There are few more lucid expressions of what it is to black metal in music, culture and values than this album. If one had to pick the best of Bathory, it would probably be his work on \\"The Return\\" and \\"Blood, Fire, Death,\\" which balance heaviness against intricacy in a deathgrip.

B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus has put out another quality release with Morning View. While it doesnt seem to have quite the same purpose that Make Yourself had it still deserves praise for the creative musical talent that Incubus always brings to the table. This CD covers a wide range of moods from the hard rocking 'Under my Umbrella' to the soft acoustical performance on 'Mexico'  all the way down to the peaceful and trance like track &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;. This CD is a must have for fans of Make Yourself. Fans of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. will notice the steady progression in the opposite direction of the hard hitting stoner rock cd. Not quite as deep as Make Yourself was, but still a very well written and well produced album, Pick it up.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This is the greatest movie. You will NOT be disappointed or disatisfied in any way. There arn't many movies that I can watch a couple times of week, and this is one that I can.  It never gets old and the laughs never stop. This is a great movie. Enjoy.
6302797535|5.0|This movie is hilarious!!  I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody).  This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie \\"Clue\\" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.  <br />It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.  <br />For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique.  You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.  <br />The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right.  I love this movie!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a wonderfull c-d and I must agree; releasing dirrty as the first track from the album can give buyers a wrong impression.<BR>Don't get me wrong; I loved it and it stayed at the top of the charts here in Holland for quite a while, but I don't think it does the album justice...it's so much more than just that!!<BR>there are a variety of styles on this album and boy does she control them !<BR>I think 'lovin me for me' is one of the best on this album and she sings it like mariah carrey ......only much beter!<BR>And what do U mean by hoochie mamma? I couldn't care less if she was the Mother of all hootchie mamma's....with that voice she can get away with everything.<BR>You go Christina.....really...you do!

B000065U1N|5.0|I watched this movie after I had read the book which<BR>I found to be excellent. A team made up of Delta Force commandoes<BR>and Army Rangers are sent to seize General Aidid and some of his inner circle. Two blackhawk helicopters are felled by grenade launchers by the forces in Mogidishu. The Delta Force soldiers and the Army Rangers are in for the fight of their lives getting out of Mogidishu with their hostages and their lives. This movie<BR>features excellent special effects as well as very realistic combat scenes. The action in the movie is realistic and very<BR>exciting.The scenes of battle are very realistic. An excellent movie that you shouldn't miss.
6302820448|5.0|This movie starts with a really interesting and original premise and plays with that premise for two hours without losing any freshness.  It's a funny story that acts on two levels.  For those of you in Philosophy: it's Nietzsche's eternal return!  Yeah, no kidding.  For those of you who have no interest in philosophy.  It's also a very light, sweet, romantic comedy.  One of my favourite movies.
B00000637V|5.0|You either get this or you dont.  What can I say, but that this was my first Lou Reed album, purchased when I was just 12 years old? Even now at 40 it still has the power of the original playing, but even more.   It floored me, and from the first listening I was dragged into the nightmarish world of \\"Berlin\\".  I truly love this album, and it has taught me the possibilities of modern music and how it can approach the level of literature.  Ive played this for some people who simply didnt get it (since they refused to sit and LISTEN to the whole thing) to others who listened, and had a good cry afterwards!  Such dark beauty, truly a masterpeice.  I only wish Lou could write like this again.  Personally, I lost interest after Coney Island Baby.... this album is not for everyone, but those of us who \\"got it\\" certainly went on to investigate our own darkness...thanks Lou, for this one.  Too bad Andy never got it to Broadway...

B000060P79|5.0|I couldn't be more happy to get this CD. When I did, I was happy to see that \\"I'd Do Anything\\" on it and \\"Perfect\\". My 4 fave songs on this CD would have to be: \\"God Must Hate Me\\" \\"Perfect\\" \\"My Alein\\" and of course, \\"I'd Do Anything\\" . Keep goin' Simple Plan! You and Avril Lavigne are the best singers (Well, one's a band) from Canada!!! Rock on, guys!
0060537639|5.0|Menzies is without a doubt an excellent storyteller, however his claims lack the substance of a true academic work (He is afterall an amateur historian).  Yet, the overwhelming evidence he provides leaves much to consider.  Unfortunately, much history most Americans learn is in actuality historiography (History retold with cultural, political, and social leanings).  Menzies is only one of many contemporary historians, attempting to uncover the \\"truth\\" and purify the historical field of its Eurocentric leanings.  If the reader can advance beyond their leanred notions of Western supremacy, this book will leave you with much to reconsider, for it dares to challenge the \\"status quo\\" that leads us to believe that the West was responsible for most human achievement.  Non-Western peoples did not merely wait for the Europeans to come along and \\"civilize or modernize\\" them.  They were capable of great feats.  This book is an excellent read, whether for academic work or pleasure.  Whether or not Menzies convinces you, the book is quite stimulating and extremely interesting.
B00004Z400|5.0|i first encountered the deftones at hfstival 2000 (for those of you in the dc area who have anything to do with music, you know what im talking about) and i must say that they put on a performance that has yet to be surpassed, and ive seen 35+ bands in concert.  the raw emotion in their music was definitely felt by the crowd and everyone was immersed in it, for better or worse (afterward, i unfortunately saw people being carried off on stretchers), but that performance had me hooked.  i immediately purchased all 3 of their cds, with white pony emerging as my favorite.  adrenaline is also a good one, and i simple was too enamored with both adrenaline and white pony that i never gave around the fur much of a chance.  anyways, purchase the album and you will be in for a musical experience that transcends reality...even if the lyrics dont make sense.
0060537639|5.0|This is a very interesting book that reads easily.  I highly recommend it.
B00005QEO1|5.0|After their commercial comeback of Permanent Vacation, Aerosmith really lets it fly on their follow-up, Pump...This album is their best work since 1976's Rocks. Track by track...<BR>1. Young Lust- Typical Aero opener of album...Hard rocking tune that just rocks.<BR>2. F.I.N.E- Tyler at his best with his tongue in cheek sexual lyrics. Great groove and one of the album's best.<BR>3. Love In An Elevator- First single that hits both Top 40 and Hard Rock appeal. Excellent extended guitar solo by Perry and Whitford. Only Tyler would penn a song like this..<BR>4. Monkey On My Back- About their drug use and a very underrated song on the album. Reminiscient of ACDC's Giving the Dog A Bone..<BR>5. Janie's Got A Gun- Biggest hit off the album and Tyler touches on subject matter that is pretty foreign to the band. One of his masterpieces...<BR>6. The Other Side- Another hit, horns give the song a special something..<BR>7. My Girl- Reminded me of old Kinks...<BR>8. Don't Get Mad, Get Even- Bluesy tune with 90's feel.<BR>9. Voodoo Medicine Man- Another underrated song.<BR>10. What It Takes- I think one of the best ballad's ever written. Not your typical power ballad, a little country feel to it and a great song.<br />Really Aerosmith at their best....
B00006LI4S|5.0|I have no doubts about it.... The Pink Floyd would not be the Pink Floyd as we know, without the skills of this Guy.<BR>David shows strong competence and imagination on this DVD. I am too impressed with the happy integration of the acustic instruments (guitars, bass and cello - Gilmour and Caroline have outstanding performances). <BR>High Hopes and Fat Old Sun are the high points of this work.<BR>You can not miss it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This Latest Christina Aguilera lp is a birth of a great voice that deserves to be ranked in the same category as the likes of &quot;Whitney Houston&quot;,&quot;Aretha Frankilin&quot;,&quot;Mariah Carey&quot;,and at times can be stronger that the voice of Mariah Carey.This lp gives the real look into the mind and heart of Chirstina Aguilera.Showing that she is not the glossy Bubble gum act that the record company tried to market her as.But is a talented singer/songwritter,and deserves the respect that her voice demanded at the American Music Awards on January 13,2003.<BR>  With Blues influenced tracks such as &quot;Impossible&quot; with the talented Alicia keys filling the void with a great piano melody and Christina's Voice demanding the attention of the listeners.<BR> And Rock influenced tracks such as the hit single &quot;Dirrty&quot; and  a strong powerful track called &quot;Fighter&quot; were her latin sultry raspy diva voice exspresses her hard core rough and stronger side.<BR> In the End this is a great start of a legend in the making.With in 5 years she'll be past the status of mariah and will be in the ranking of Aretha franklin and Celine Dion.Winning me over as a fan when three years ago I cringded when I heard her songs &quot;Gennie In A Bottle&quot;,&quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; and &quot;Come On Over&quot;,but she proved her talent in the song remake &quot;Lady Momerlad&quot; she is honistly a Diva and legend In the making.
0060278269|5.0|I got this book not expecting much, because though I loved Sabriel, Lireal wasn't as good.  Boy was I surprised!!!  From the first pages it grabbed me and pulled me along the amazing plot.  I found myself falling further in love with my favorite characters and growing fond of even those that I had not liked as much in Lireal.  The action was intense and I was reading as fast as I could.  At the end, I shocked myself by crying- something I usually never do in books.  An amzing story that is greater and more magnificent than both of it's predecessors.  A great end to a fantastic series- though I would LOVE to read more about the Old Kingdom.  ABHORSEN is one of the best books I have read- right up there with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter!  I reccomend this book to everyone- though they should read it's prequels, SABRIEL and LIREAL before reading it.  Cheers Garth Nix!
B00006RU5B|5.0|How can you start a review of an album by a band whose members' reputations precede them like Audioslave? Thehype that was surrounding the album and the band could not have been met in greater style than with this amazing album, which sets the standard for other bands to follow. Starting with the powerful &quot;Cochise&quot; - the first single, one is tempted to feel that the tone will be set by the infectious riffs that Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello and Brad Wilk were famous for. However, be mistakened... the more melodic vocal lines and composition skills of Chris Cornell surface not only in Cochise, but throughout the album, showing that the Euphoria Morning album was not just a one-off thing, but a new step in Cornell's vision of his own musicality.<BR>For those who are looking for the headbanging tunes, Set It Off and Gasoline are good tunes to rock to, while Hypnotiser surprised me for the socially awareness of the content of the lyrics on that track, showing that the social activism of the other band mates is feeding through Cornell's writing.<BR>What can I say? It is definitely the album of the year, and this band promises to be a referrence for the rock scene at the dawn of the 21st century...
B00006IU73|5.0|THANK GOD! I was really getting bogged down by all of the mainstream garbage that I hear strewn about the airwaves and on MTV and VH1. I felt as if real music was being made only by a select few. Well, my fears have been put to rest (at least for awhile) with the release of &quot;In Absentia.&quot;<br />Musicians who play their own instruments? Recorded in the analog domain? No countless Pro-tools overdubs? Could this be music? The answer to all of these questions is simply: yes.<br />Without getting into specific tracks, I will say that I was grabbed by them all. What I've enjoyed repeatedly from this album is each song's unique structure, and the fact that in many cases, the song will divert from one musical style to another quite abruptly, keeping the listener on his / her toes and, more importantly, interested. Listen to &quot;Trains&quot;  for a very good example of this.<br />I'm new to Porcupine tree (I was introduced to the band by this album's album's mastering engineer - Andy VanDette).  I can only say that I'm glad we made the acquaintance. It's like I've been re-introduced to good music all over again. <br />The technical aspects of this album are top notch - from recording to mixing to mastering. Paul Northfield and Tim Palmer deserve special mention for capturing this music and mixing it just right! As for Andy VanDette, all I can say is &quot;thanks&quot;. Thanks for the introduction to this band. For your part, you did a great job on this disc, my friend!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Excellent movie!<BR>I saw this against my will at my aunt's house as there was nothing else on TV and I thought I would get to fall asleep early.  I was tired.  I never read the book and hate trends.  Being Oppositionally Defiant,  I definately protested this movie but gave in for a good snooze.  I absolutely fell in love with this movie and needless to say stayed up until the credits rolled; rewinding parts my aunt talked through.  I'm 31 years old and feel that this is a movie for the ages.  This is a definate must see!!!!!
0151008116|4.0|I HATED it that one of the cover reviews said something like &quot;you can't help but find God after reading this novel.&quot;  Huh?  I searched for such a revelation, but I was not rewarded.<br />No matter.  This was a beautiful book.  I love the Latin-American type of magical realism, and I read this as a cultural variant--much more subtle and (perhaps?) more skilled.<br />Whether or not the novel's experiences of Pi were actual, we find, at the end, that it doesn't matter.  We have been on a great and tortuous journey, and we have learned a lot.  Beautiful writing, and a beautiful and unique story line.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Good chick flick. Not some of Harrison Ford's best work but still a great movie.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|I still prefer the debut and &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, but this one is a great album to listen to in the car.  There's no deep and profound message, but the songs are still very entertaining.  Even if you look beyond the hits like 'Money For Nothing', there is still some great blues-folk rock, which is what Mark Knopfler and Co. do best.  Maybe it could have been cut down a little bit, as some of the songs are a little too long, but once I hear the sheer beauty of the title track, I know that I have just listened to a great album by a great band.  A must for anyone who likes any of the previous DS albums, or for anyone who wants to see what 80's rock could be.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Great album.I really enjoyed it.youve heard all their singles before imagine them in one album.Some of Nirvana's best work combinded in to one album.Everytime i listen to the album its like I have never heard the songs beofore the music still to this day has quality.I recomend this album to anyone who has ever heard and loved one of Nirvana's singles.Va
B0000073BG|4.0|The first side of this album is the best side of Renaissance music ever.  I like it even more than side two of &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot;.  Trip To the Fair is my favorite Renaissance song ever.  The introduction is beautiful beyond words.  Ocean Gypsy is a very pretty song, that takes some criticism from non-Renaissance fans.  The song doesn't deserve that criticism.  It simply rules.  Side two is occupied by a 25-minute epic called Songs of Scheherazade, which I used to be bored with, but time has altered my opinion on it.  It isn't as great as side one, and it isn't among my favorite sidelong tracks, but I really have grown to enjoy the song.  Sure, it has some boredom, but what 25-minute song doesn't?  It could have been a little better, but it wouldn't have been easy.  I still prefer Turn of the Cards and Ashes Are Burnng, but this album is an epic, and one of the best products released by one of the best bands ever.
B000069AUI|4.0|I love this album almost every song sounds distiguished.One thing that their previous album was missing was their lyrics.Their lyrics made no sence what so ever.I guess coldplay decided to change that every song has a meaning and is easy to relate to.Every song on their album rush of bloood to the head has a unique touch to it and is very love-able.Buy all means if you like their singles you will love the album
B000002J1B|3.0|I know Yes fans call this one of their best albums, if not their best album, but I'm just not getting it.  For one, I far prefer Close To the Edge to The Gates of Delirium, and I've never seen the big deal about it.  It is a good song, but it could have been cut, and the ending isn't moving, at least in my humble opinion.  Side two is worse, with Sound Chaser being one of my least favorite Yes songs.  If you love the crazy sounds of King Crimson, or Zappa's weirdest material (such as &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot;), you may love this song.  I don't.  To Be Over is nice, but it is a feeble attempt to recreate the majestic And You And I.  I get bored about four minutes in.  So this is a small improvement over &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot;, but you have to have very specific tastes to fully enjoy it.  &quot;Relayer&quot; isn't bad though.

B000002NZO|4.0|Okay, so maybe it isn't the classic \\"Foxtrot\\" is, but this is still a highly enjoyable album, with a soft relaxing sound with a few intense moments, the typical Gabriel-era Genesis sound.  The only reason this isn't as good as \\"Nursery Cryme\\" or \\"Selling England By the Pound\\" is because there are just a few moments of boredom.  But believe me, you won't feel bored when you're dealing with the atmosphere of Looking For Someone, the beauty of Stagnation and Visions of Angels, or the intensity of The Knife.  I used to dislike this one, and I'll admit that it takes a while to appreiciate, but the time and effort is worth it, and eventually you'll really come to enjoy this album.  That is, of course, if you're like me.
B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston's character in THE GOOD GIRL is likely as much of an opposite of her character on Friends as we'll ever see. Aniston is obviously comfortable within the character's personality, as she is very believable and at times, drolly comical as the girl who can't get a break. Her days are a real drudge as she works the makeup counter at the local discount store in her small town. Not much happens in this town other than going shopping and going to church.<br />It's an escape from this humdrum life that Aniston's character, Justine, wants so badly. She's married but not very happily and the events that follow are nothing you'd find in her romantic comedies. Saying that the movie is a welcome departure from roles she's taken on in the past, showing her audience she's more than capable of handling dark comedy, as well as the happy-go-lucky stuff she's been doing on Friends all these years.<br />The other standout performance that provided huge comic relief is from Zooey Deschanel, who plays Justine's co-worker, Cheryl. Deschanel has some of the funniest moments in the film, all delivered with a deadpan style so fitting to her character's outlook on life.<br />I really liked this film, but didn't feel great or uplifted after seeing it. Rather, I felt sorry for Justine and those family and friends in her life, who seem to attract nothing more to their lives than daily doses of misery.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Resident Evil is one of those few movies based on a video game that actually looks good, not unbelieveably \\"fake\\" and actually resembles the game its based on quite well unlike such failures as Final Fantasy, Mortal Kombat: Annialation, Super Mario Bros., Street Fighter, and Double Dragon. The Bonus Features are great and they are:The Making of Resident Evil, Scoring Resident Evil, Costume Design, Set Design, Zombie Make Up Tests, Trailer(s) and the Slipknot music video \\"My Plague (New Abuse Mix\\". I recommend this DVD to Everyone on Amazon.com and by the way, this is request is for anyone who owns this DVD, if anyone out there knows the name of the band and/or the song on the Resident evil Trailer that plays after Milla Jovovich says \\"She maybe your only way out of here.\\" please E-Mail me at [...]
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters Inc. is a very good movie, but I think the hype left me a bit dissapointed. <BR>The story of monsters behind our closet doors we all feared as children is outstanding. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are absolutely amazing as the voices behind the two main characters, and will be identified with these roles for years to come. However, I didn't find it as funny as many other reviewers. There were some jokes I chuckled at, but nothing I really laughed out loud about. The role of the child in the movie is a bit weak, I would have liked to have seen the animators make her a bit older and funnier. I did find the parallels between the real world and the world of the monsters funny at times. <BR>What I thought was the funniest part of the movie was actually the &quot;out takes&quot; at the end of the DVD. Those are the things I really laughed out loud at.
0060523794|2.0|As a departed employee of many years, the book provided little to capture my attention except to learn that Lou did at least have some grasp of the gridlock and culture problems resulting from chronic political infighting in the management ranks. There was no sudden clarity for why his apparent reign of terror was good for IBM, its customers, employees or the communities. Developing a good understanding of the situation inside of the company, but without a clue of how to compete in the industry, he develops a plan to keep IBM solvent. Indeed, IBM was a place where the brown spots in the lawns were painted green prior to a visit from the CEO. How much can a CEO actually know in a place like that? Lou neglects to discuss that his plan was to sell the seed corn, slash, burn and reap whatever was left of intrinsic value for personal gain. Basically, his plan to save the company was to 1) Surround himself with loyal friends. 2) Fire anyone that could get in his way. 3) Buy everyone else out with stock options and the resulting fear of loss 4) Sell every asset possible to generate cash. (including trees from un-used land) 5) Shut down every business that lost money. 6) Lay off everyone possible that contributed to pension liabilities. 7) Raid the remaining pension fund and use that cash to prop the stock price. 8) Make stock price the primary objective for everyone. 10) Ride the dot-com bubble to the top and bail out. 11) Write a book to justify his actions so he could sleep at night. Nowhere in the book does he mention anything about the rank and file, the thousands of families that lost their homes, ability to send kids to college, and lifetimes to prepare for retirement. Little is mentioned of any effort to develop new businesses, or describe technological initiatives, or the creation of anything. Nowhere does he describe the untold wealth he accumulated through his vast stock options. There are almost no stories about encounters with anyone interesting except a coupleof backhanded swipes to the likes of Bill Gates. There are virtually no facts or numbers to back him up other than some very selective charts in an appendix. If you are looking for a book to tell you how to save a company, this is not it. If you are looking for book to learn how to be a great leader, this is not it. If you are looking for a book to learn how fouled up a big company can get, and how to leverage that for personal gain well, you will get that, but you have to read between the lines to put those pieces together.
0151008116|5.0|To be honest, when I read the book blurb, I didn't know if I would like this book.  Having said that, let me add that &quot;Life of Pi&quot; by Yann Martel is a wonderful read.  Martel takes his reader through emotions ranging from hilarious to heart-wrenching.  Pi is an exceptional character readers will empathize with and root for.  I won't give a book description, as that has been done previously, but suffice it to say this book is exceptional.  The ending will leave you thinking about the book long after you have read it.
B00004XPP0|5.0|The original trilogy won't be released for DVD until after episode III comes out. It's rumored that George Lucas is shooting new scenes for the Original Trilogy and Episode IV- A new Hope is being rescored with the Imperial March in it, Natalie Portman also is going to have scenes in Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So expect a huge FINAL six-part DVD release after Episode III leaves theatres, I can't wait!!!!!!!
B000002VC5|4.0|The Alan Parson Project is generally thought of as a 'progressive rock' band: i.e, Yes, King Crimson, et. al. However, this, their second recording, is very straight-forward, and the music is highly accessible, with a few of the bizzare orchestral numbers as an exception. In fact, some of the tracks, like &quot;I Wouldn't Want to be Like You&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; were pretty moderate disco hits, and I still hear them on local radio stations from time to time. <BR>  I first heard this album about 6 years ago. I was a very big Pink Floyd fan, and i'd read somewhere about how Alan Parsons was an engineer on such ground-breaking albums like the Beatles &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Discovering that he was also a successful musical force as well, I bought this and another of his albums, &quot;Pyramid&quot;. What really blew me away was the title track to this album, with fades in very slowly with a synth drone, and gradually crescendoes into a sort of funky groove, replete with just tons of instruments and sound effects. Parson's background in sound engineering paid off very well: this is a disc that definetly needs to be heard with a good-quality speaker system.<BR>   I can't really go on too much about the songs....some of them really do resemble Pink Floyd, though. It's almost ironic that one tune &quot;Day After Day (The Show Must Goes On)&quot; would share a title with a track from Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; (sans the 'day after day' part). However, this music is for the most part, wholely original, and deserves at least a listening from people who not only enjoy good quality music, but good quality sound as well. I've yet to hear the DVD audio (or supposedly mixed?) but I find it sounds great just in standard CD audio (i've even heard the vinyl copy, and it sounds great too!) <BR>   Final words? Nah....the music 'speaks for itself'....(insert laughter here)
B00005JLSC|5.0|Chicago has everything a muscial should have.  Humor, charm, great dancing and fun characters.  For my money, Richard Gere steals the show as Flynn, giving an over-the-top performance that caused you to focus on him any timE he was on screen.  One of the things that made Chicago work was that incoporated the set pieces and look of the stage production.  Like the older musicals, Chicago maintained tha perfect balance between reality and fantasy.  Everyone should see Chicago and enjoy the wonderful work of Jones, Gere, and Renee, who also did a grand job.  They all deserve Oscar noms. Great show!
0553296981|5.0|I first read The Diary of Anne Frank in 6th grade but didn't finish it. Looking back on it I couldn't identify with Anne yet.<br />I tried it again in 7th grade and read it all the way through that time. It is probably one of the best accounts of the Holocaust that I have ever read and believe me I have read many!<br />What shocks me the most about this book is the raw truth about it. Anne, as a teenage Jewish girl during WWII wrote what she saw and felt. It must have been terrifying for her every day. Not knowing if she and her family were going to be found by the Nazi's or even if she would live to see the next day.<br />It is a portarit of a young girl who wanted to live life.<br />And it breaks my heart every time I read it knowing that she would not get to experience life like she should have been able to.<br />In a time when people were mere statistics we are involved in knowing the terror, hope, anger and dreams of one true, genuine person.

B00005JL5S|5.0|First I own all of Stephens work and this is his most mainstream film yet, I'm not suprised it got a release in the states.<br />If you read the preview then you'll know the story is pretty simple but around this is good comedy, characters and special FX. <BR>All the performances from the actors are great espeically the bruce lee like mannorisms from the goalkeeper and Chows regular supporting cast member \\"Ng Man Tat\\" as golden leg.<br />The football matches may seem unrealistic but this is cinema, this is kung fu with Football ! Suspend belief and enjoy it for what it is, entertaining and funny, the final match between good vs evil will leave you feeling that you watched something special and something you'll want to watch again.<BR> <BR>I dont know how the US version got dubbed, but or subtitled but hopefully it wasnt too bad !<BR>highly recommended.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room For Squares is an original sounding blend of musical styles that defies logical description,reminiscent of Jazz on tracks like Neon and 83, uniquely appealing in pop-folk on tracks like Why georgia,and My Stupid mouth. These songs are universal snapshots of the human spirit on the rise, the angst of growth and love of a sensitive and empathetic individual, and a genius on par with such artists as Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell, and Paul Simon. This song while reminiscent of other artists has acquired its own sound, the landmark of any true artist. In my opinion this is one of the ten best albums of the Rock era,and my favorite of all 310 in my personal collection and I do not buy often. I had to have this one.You will too.
B00006BTCA|1.0|It's funny how music fans invest so much emotion and time into these bands that fly so far below the radar that they will never have an effect on other bands and in ten years time (at its extreme) will be largely forgotten and sold back to the cd store for the next newer repo-bands. People that don't buy into the major label bands jettison the fact that many of these musicians (please don't call them artists) have had a lasting effect on other musicians. Miles Davis for example. Hendrix for example. Simon and Garf for example. Ask yourself this if you're deciding against a major label band vs a poor man's Joy Division: Was I missing out on something genuine when my dollars went towards this garbage instead. Think about how little time you have on Earth and how better spent it would be to go with Bill Evans. Maybe when you're on your deathbed you'll realize how much a wasted life you were by devoting so much to so little.
B00005YW4H|1.0|After hearing Norah Jones 'Don't Know Why' I balked at a reviewer in my local paper who called her album [bad] Until I bought it. There is nothing new or original on this album. Norah Jones sounds like Billie Holiday and not better, or improved. The songs are full of an indulgent sort of self-pity,and are not outstanding in their appeal,the only other good song is The Nearness of You again to which she brings nothing new. Listen before you buy. If you like upbeat music and message, this album is not for you.
B000002H97|4.0|Everyone who thinks this is the best album is SOOOOOOOOO wrong! I think Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All are THE BEST albums! But still &quot;Metallica&quot; is a good album. I have it on DVD-Audio and regular CD, but I have to say the CD is better, maybe this is because I don't have a DVD-Audio player and I listen to it in Dolby 5.1, but anyway, I think this is one of Metallica's &quot;good&quot; albums. Pretty much any of their '80s material is &quot;awesome&quot; but anything from the '90s is just &quot;good&quot; with the exception of &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; even though that wasn't original stuff. Anyway, if you're a true Met fan get this CD if you don't have it!
B000051VWW|5.0|This is one of my favorites by my favorite. Sade adapts without changing too much on every album she makes,to the trend of the day, and the milennium hardness does not compromise the elegant, sophisticated, ubiqituosly conscious of love and social issues on this CD. &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; are classics, progressive classics especially for Sades fans. A must have.
B000002ITM|5.0|I've always hated the people who cry and whine &quot;sellout!&quot; when a band tries to grow and mature their sound.<br />The lyrics, guitarwork, and overall quality and refinement of this album is *TOP* notch.  &quot;Return to Serenity&quot; almost brings tears to my eyes; there is such feeling and emotion in the songs that it pains me to see where the band has gone now, and how the separation of heavy metal fans and their adamant &quot;underground&quot; attitude can otherwise prevent musicians from making superior music.<br />I got rid of all the Testament albums I had after this one, because they just felt very 'angsty' and like they were trying to appease all the folks who essentially screamed at them for trying to make some eloquently heavy music with 'The Ritual'.<br />A fantastic CD that will never grow old in your collection.
B00005A8GY|5.0|I disagree with the criticisms of the previous reviewers.  This SACD doesn't have a showy sound of the newer productions - but to my ears it just gets close to the old original master tape, with its limitations like tape hiss.  I like the sound but I bought this SACD really for the great music.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Until last week, when I decided to give this CD a chance, I was so suspicious about all the hype I've heard about this band that when I bought it I thought that I was wasting my money on just another \\"The\\" band. But boy, was I wrong: this is not another \\"The\\" band. Less than three listenings to this record, and I felt in love with it and I understood why all that has been said about The Strokes. \\"Is this it\\" is a high-voltage, stripped-down rock that can't be just put away. No fancy zone here: no fancy tunes, no fancy drum playing, and of course, no fancy guitar playing. Please pay attention to Julian Casasnovas' laid-back singing: is a textbook on cockiness that doesn't depend on the so much copied \\"Blink 182-Green Day-Sum 41\\" singing (which, by the way, owes much to Sam Coomes. Those who know whom I'm talking about will surely agree with me in this point. Those who doesn't know whom I'm talking about, better run, and go buy everything from \\"Quasi\\"). So, if you're looking for something really refreshing to your ears, you have come to the place. Give this CD a chance. Discover by yourself why all the hype about this band. So, check this out. Enjoy.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I've enjoyed watching this series from it's inception.  What has been interesting is sharing it with my family.  My kids were only in grade school when they first watched, and they seemed to get as big a kick out of them as us old parents did.  Now they are devoted Wodehouse fans and enjoy his other stories too.  The characters seem to enjoy being dragged thru the ringer of the old master PGW. If you enjoy comedy, 1920's flavor styles and music, sumptuous sets, or even gorgeous views of old England, you should enjoy these enough to bear through them with pluck and your chin up.
B000002H97|3.0|Before you flame me, the three stars in in comparison to what they had released up 'till then. Gone was the complexity and intelligence of Master and Justice...instead we get monochromatic, watered down rockers, ballads and foreshadowing the travesty of S&M a few years later-STRINGS for crissakes (made me think of Jon [Deep Purple]Lord's horror--The Concerto for Group and Orchestra). <BR>OK, I'm NOT asking that they should have kept repeating themselves like so many other bands have/do. I just feel it was a backward step artistically (I'm glad they were able to make a bunch of money BTW, I just wish that they would release something INTERSTING again.)
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton's career started with high-tech novels that were thought-provoking and very suspenseful. Then he moved into the Jurassic Park field, where he terrorized us with a nature-runs-amock plot. But ever since he tangled with corporate law in Disclosure, Crichton's efforts have been less than stellar. Airframe was lame and boring, and Timeline was long-winded and not very exciting. But I'm happy to say that the real Crichton, the Jurrasic Park and Andromeda Strain Crichton is back. And boy is this a great welcome party!<br />Of course, he does not let go of his favorite theme; nature vs. mankind. In Prey, a family man named Jack (can you have a more average-joe name?) is thrown into a virtual nightmare when he is brought to the Nevada desert to help a research group with a problematic new technology.<br />This group, led by Jack's wife (who is now in the hospital after a serious car accident), has developped small camera-like atom particles that can run in minuscule places (like the human body for example) to take pictures. Only, they have come to realize that their strain has begun evolving on its own and that one of them has escape. And soon enough, they find themselves faced with something much more dangerous: a computerized plague that kills remorselessly everything that comes on its path.<br />Crichton is great at writing high-adrenalyn suspense scenes. Prey does not disappoints. The moment Jack steps foot in the desert, the tension starts building. And building. And building. The levels of suspense are so great at times that it's just impossible to put the book down. This is a littke like John Carpenter's The Thing, set in the desert with a lot of technological mumbo-jumbo talk. But fortunately, Crichton's technological writing is done in a way that almost everyone will be able to follow without getting lost in all the high-tech talk. <br />If you can get passed Crichton's simplistic writing (sometimes, much too simplisitc) and corny dialogue, what you'll find is a thrill ride that'll make you bite your nails to the bone. Prey isn't a great novel. It's fun, action-packed and highly entertaining. Everything you've come to expect from a good Crichton yarn, and more.
0312305060|1.0|I finally finished reading this book after putting in down at least a dozen times. I finished it only because of the overwhelming hype surrounding it, aided by its brevity. Dull, dull, dull. I haven't seen the movie, but the previews for it look quite interesting. I would love to have been the screenwriter for the movie. I would have been able to flesh out and develop the characters in ways the author does not. From what little I've seen of the movie trailers, they have done just that. I kept at it, hoping something would happen. Here's a clue... almost nothing does. Oh, and there's no grand message either. The written story is dull and depressing; the movie previews appear to have more vitality. My recommendation would be to see the movie.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is easily the scariest movie ever made, but you actually have to have an attention span, to fully enjoy this film. You also must take it seriously, and not cracks jokes about it. You also need to watch it alone in the dark for the ultimate experience. I can't tell you anything that hasn't already been said. All I have to say is BUY this movie, It is without a question, THE SCARIET MOVIE EVER MADE!!! Scarier than The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, The Ring, The Shining, Silence of the Lambs, and The Evil Dead! Truely the SCARIEST movie ever made!!! See it tonight.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of the best packaged DVD collections you'll find.  You could spend hours with the extras, as they're informative and fun (imagine being paid to ride around on a scooter as a tour guide, like the director and the Pixar associates!).  Mike's New Car is funny (made for the video release, skip the commentary for it, though) and For the Birds is cute!      John Goodman plays John Sullivan, the lovable larger than life blue monster, who leads the pack at scaring kids.  His pal Mike (a cyclops voiced by Billy Crystal) is well-meaning, chatty and hilarious.  Somehow, they wind up with a cute 2-month old human they nickname \\"Boo\\" (you must understand that humans are considered contaminating, as one monster gets its fur shaved for contact with another human).  Can they return \\"Boo\\" back to her door?  Will Mike ever get things right with his girlfriend?  And can \\"Sully\\" still lead the pack even with the snake-like Randall?  The door scene close to the end of the movie is a real highlight!    Kudos to Goodman, Crystal et al for their vocal performances, Randy Newman for his musical score, especially the winsome song \\"If I Didn't Have You,\\" directors Lee Unkrich, David Silverman and Pete Docter and producers John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Darla K. Anderson!      The \\"outtakes\\" are pretty funny, especially the play \\"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me.\\"  After you've watched the movie in full, check out the commentary (don't watch it beforehand or you may find out a secret too soon!).
6304697961|5.0|Now talk about scary, this is easily one of the scariest movies ever created. Not superior to The Exorcist, but still a shocking and gripping horror film. This has amazing atmosphere, amazing acting, and AMAZING MUSIC! This is better than Black Christmas and Psycho, but I think Texas Chainsaw Massacre has this one beat. Anyway if you're thinking about buying this, I suggest you do so immediately! WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!
B00004TRD8|5.0|I cannot think of high enough praise for this ultimate edition dvd of TERMINATOR 2-JUDGMENT DAY!  Comes with extras that will keep you busy for hours, and the picture and sound quality will amaze!  All you terminator fans, get this or \\"GET OUT\\" (chuckle)
B00006RJHG|5.0|I guess it is my job to recomend the good horror films from the bad. This is one of the good, no GREAT horror films. Now I know what you are thinking \\"Oh it's just another slasher flick,\\" not at all! This is and exceptionally scary and disturbing movie and ranks as ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES EVER MADE! I won't spoil any details for you, but I garantee that you will not regret purchasing this gem of a horror film. This isn't just a film, it is an experience! You must buy Black Christmas Now!!
0385508417|3.0|Skipping Christmas was our December 2002 Festive Reading Selection.<br />This is a book where our members varied in opinions a lot.  While some of our members loved the book and thought it was funny while others didn't care for the main character or thought the this book didn't live up to Grisham's writing abilities.<br />The majority of our members did like the storyline and loved the fact that Nora and Luther wanted to take a year off of the hustle and bustle of the Holidays to take a cruise.  We all basically thought that their neighbors were rude and inconsiderate and some of us didn't think the ending was realistic.<br />When we polled the members for a rating, the lowest and more common was 3/5 but we did have one member that rated this book 5/5.  Our average rating for this book was a 3.5/5, but for Amazon purposes I have listed it as a 3/5.
B00005JL1C|5.0|Like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful treated its teenaged characters like real people with real feelings, hopes, fears, and desire. That is very rare these days when you have films like American Pie and Not Another Teen Movie out there. This is FAR FAR FAR SUPERIOR to those worthless [movies]. (Okay American Pie was funny though) This is a great film would good acting and a great story. It is also something that one can relate to. We've all had a secret crush on someone at some point in our lives, and 90% of us were the outcasts. This film will appeal to all people, not those just looking for great films. I'd recommend buying or renting today!
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest concert put on film. Song after song - no bull - just one great song after the other. Try to pick your favorite Bee Gee Song and you realize the place this group has in the history of music. The brothers Gibb work in such perfect harmony. The dvd sounds so much better on the home surround system. Truly an outstanding dvd that is worth every dollar that you pay for it.
630521610X|1.0|This movie ... as a horror film. Better viewed as a comedy. I watched this one alone in the dark and laughed my head off. Even my sister ... got scared in Jack-O thought this film was hilarious and she also watched it alone. If you're looking for good horror see Halloween or The Exorcist, or even Friday the 13th, but if you want a laugh out loud side bursting comedy, see Scream. I garantee you'll be laughing and NEVER SCREAMING during this comedy.

B00000258J|5.0|Muddy Waters was easily one of the greatest talents to emerge in Blues music from his very first recordings in the mid-1940's until the day he died.  After moving to Chicago in the late 1940's he forged alliances with other Southern transplants and helped to create a Blues sound that that been highly admired by blues fans around the world.  His recordings from the 1950's are treasures.  As the popularity in Blues ebbed during the 1960's and 70's, Muddy's career ebbed as well.  It was only through the help of his admirers that his career was kept alive.<br />It was with this and a few other albums that Blues fan and master guitarist Johnny Winter produced that put new life into Muddy's career.  Winter assembled some of Chicago's best, including master harmonica blaster James Cotton, and made some of Muddy's very best recordings.  Winters allowed the musicians, himself included, to play with reckless abandon and the results were Blues that had the heart and soul that make Blues so damn fun to listen to.  Clean, but not overproduced, these songs are some of Muddy's best and everybody attacks each song like it were the last time they'd ever get to play.  There is not one single weak song in the bunch and if I were compiling a list of the 100 best Blues albums of all time, this would make my top 10.<br />I definitely recommend that you get a copy of this CD if you haven't bought it already.  It's definitely a must-have.
B000000W5N|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is one of the greatest albums of all time!
B000066C1N|5.0|I LOVED this movie and loved it even more when I heard Bryan's voice.  I would highly recommend the movie to children and adults alike.  I would also recommend the CD.
B00000JGHM|4.0|I have always had mixed emotions about Michael Mann's 1995 crime epic \\"Heat.\\" Undoubtedly, it is an extraordinary film complete with a handful of great performances, electric action sequences, brilliant editing, unforgettable style and a thoughtful screenplay. No stone is left unturned in Mann's interesting view of modern-day police/thief battles. \\"Heat\\" also nicely compliments Mann's past work (\\"Thief,\\" \\"Manhunter\\") dealing with similar themes and obsessions.<br />But the film's keynote action sequence, when Robert De Niro's criminal gang robs an LA bank, leading to an explosive standoff with Al Pacino's police force, is such a surreal, mind-blowing, testosterone-pumped clash, that one uncomfortably realizes this type of behavior is being romanticized. It is doubtful De Niro's gang could ever fight their way out of such an OK Corral situation. But they do, eventually leaving what appears to be a squadron of police officers and cars mauled, injured and dying.<br />De Niro's gang essentially becomes indestructible gladiator supermen, on the level of Sergio Leone gunfighters from \\"Once Upon a Time in the West.\\" But Leone's film takes place in a fantasy west over 100 years ago, while Mann's world lands right square in the middle of modern-day civilization. It's disturbing, even more so when one realizes that any unbalanced fool with a society ax to grind will watch \\"Heat\\" and see themselves as these stylish, if not noble, criminal warriors. In fact, just such a bank robbery took place in LA, in which desperate men tried to mimic the very robbery seen in \\"Heat.\\" But reality is not fantasy, and these men ended up dead.<br />I could go on and on about the quality of \\"Heat,\\" and it is indeed a brilliant work from a master director. I love Al Pacino's performance. I enjoy Jon Voight's character turn as De Niro's criminal connection. Ashley Judd is stunning as the long-suffering wife of Val Kilmer. The cinematography and set direction is inspired, if not unforgettable.<br />But one cannot escape the fact that Mann's work glamorizes the criminal lifestyle - turning thieves (albeit high class, successful thieves) into cool anti-heroes. The criminal life is cruel, brutal and morally bankrupt. And while the standoff in \\"Heat\\" could possibly be compared to the final standoff in Sam Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" Mann has placed his protagonists squarely into our everyday lives. This has been done before in Abel Ferrara's brilliant \\"King of New York.\\" But anyone who has ever watched that harrowing (if not superior) film, realizes that those criminals are leading anything but an attractive lifestyle.<br />There's no grit in \\"Heat.\\" And perhaps the criminal suits are a bit too well pressed.
0790734060|3.0|I watched this when I was about six years old, and all I remembered was the man with the blood on his hands at the beginning (my mother tuld me to turn around), the little boy dropping coins through his hands, and Mozart dictating music... and a few other minor things.<br />Now, years later, my mother rented it and we watched it to see if we still liked it. It didn't seem as long this time - by that I mean it seemed really long but not as long as I remembered it.<br />My impressions: I didn't appreciate the language and Mozart's crude sense of humour, nor did I appreciate Salieri's horrible, warped view of God. It was so pitiful and sad, and I could not feel for him at all. I didn't really go for many of the actors either. My favourites were the stuffy guy with the glasses and Mozart's dad - don't ask me why. Constanze was a loudmouthed, 1980's woman with modern values and attitude; Mozart looked like any teenager out on the street, just with a wig, and he sounded like them too. Aggravating.<br />I felt some aspects of the movie had much potential. I think Salieri could have been portrayed as more evil than he was by merely toning down the narration and letting the camera tell the story. I thought Salieri's idea of haunting Mozart with his dad was cinematically superb, but something was missing, some vital link to make the torment real to ME, the watcher, not just Mozart.<br />What else do I have to say... probably not much except that this movie did leave me feeling rather \\"unsettled\\" - I think I was hoping for more than it was, and a bit on edge the whole time because I never knew when Mozart was going to be rude again...<br />I'm not even sure of the educational value of this film, since I can't recommend it to student-age folks, and I don't know how historically accurate it is anyway. See it if you like, but I can't promise you'll be impressed.

B00007E8V4|5.0|People, people! YES, YES, YES! SOAD HAS COME OUT WITH A NEW ALBUM! And it's better than the first two! Dont get me wrong Sytem Of A Down, Self titled, and Toxicity were great albums. But, STEAL THIS ALBUM raised the bar once more for Serj and the gang. Luckily you hear more Serj than the lead guitarist which makes this better than the others (though Toxicity has the least!). Thanks to SOAD we now have a metal band that doesnt just scream! It's completle thoughts carried into great flows of music. With poltics, hard feelings and even war, this CD had to have been released or SOAD would not be as loved as they are by headbangers everywhere. Great lyrics, great drums, great guitars, I highly suggest you STEAL THIS ALBUM!!!

B00005JLSC|5.0|I saw the original \\"Chicago\\" on Broadway with Gwen Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach and it was absolutely incredible.  Well, now I can say this filmed version is that and more.  Zeta-Jones, Zellwegger, Gere and Latifah are a perfect team for this crass and cynical movie.  I'm glad they gave Rivera a cameo (why didn't they for Orbach?) and while I understand they had to cut the song \\"Class,\\" I would have liked to have heard it over the end credits (instead of the so-so \\"I Just Move On\\" which was specially written for that purpsoe).  At least \\"Class\\" is on the soundtrack and it's even crasser and funnier than before with the addition of a certain lyric.  This is a great musical (even bertter than \\"Moulan Rouge\\" which I liked) and I recommend it for all film fans.
B0000666DW|5.0|I generally like my music heavy or technical, preferably both. To put it mildly, Mastodon scores big in both areas. \\"Remission\\" is basically the musical equivalent of a carpet-bombing raid. It's sustained, it's precise, and it's unforgiving. I've heard some pretty monstrous albums in my time, but this one leaves most of them in the dust. With songwriting and musicianship that blows pretty much everyone on the radio out of the water, Mastodon have created an instant heavy-music landmark with \\"Remission.\\"<br />Although every band member excels, drummer Brann Dailor definitely deserves special mention. With an average drummer Mastodon would be good, but with this guy they're unbelievable! Brann's drumming pushes the music to new heights of technicality and intensity. His beats are so frenetic and complex I don't think Einstein could figure them out. Any time it looks as if there might be even the slightest lull in a song, he jumps in with his astonishingly fluid fills. He's definitely gonna go down in the annals of metal's all-time best drummers before he's done.<br />As for the album, it rarely lets up in intensity, even in the instrumental parts. It's a constant barrage of harsh shouts, pulverizing riffs, and ever-changing tempos. And did I mention the drumming? It's really good too. Every song is excellent, with creative structures that provide the band members plenty of opportunities to show off their skills. The epic \\"Ol'e Nessie\\" is definitely a highlight. For about two and a half minutes, the song is a midtempo instrumental, and it sounds like it might be a bit of a breather. But then, the heavy riffs and menacing shouts start back up, and the band commences pummeling the listener into the ground once again. \\"Trilobite,\\" another choice cut, brilliantly mixes crushing heaviness with calm acoustic passages. The instrumental closer \\"Elephant Man\\" is a nice touch as well, ending the album on a mellow note after ten mostly insane tracks.<br />It's really too bad that a band as good as Mastodon isn't going to be heard by many people (I certainly wouldn't mind seeing these guys performing at halftime of the Super Bowl next weekend instead of Shania Twain). But for those privileged people who know the best music typically resides beneath the radar of popular consciousness, \\"Remission\\" should provide plenty of enjoyment. If, like me, you're always on the lookout for a good mix of heaviness and technicality, you can find your salvation right here.a band as good as Mastodon isn't going to be heard by many people (I certainly wouldn't mind seeing these guys performing at halftime of the Super Bowl next weekend instead of Shania Twain).

B00006X06U|4.0|The beautiful moments and tremendous arrangements on Travelogue are indeed sublime. If you're already familiar with Joni Mitchell's work, you may very well find such gems as Amelia, You Dream Flat Tires and (especially) Dawntreader to be even better than the originals. The problem with this 2-CD collection is that it is just too much...a little too long, one or two too many slow-tempo numbers and too much seriousness. But, to be fair, Joni Mitchell is one of the very few pop songwriters whose body of work could stand up to (or carry) dense orchestral arrangements such as these, and the songs included are worthy of such a grand (some say grandiose) treatment (Big Yellow Taxi and Chelsea Morning were not included for that reason, obviously). <br />If you're looking for an overview of Mitchell's career, this isn't it (that whats the Hits and Misses CDs are for). Instead, Travelogue is an all-new presentation of the popular, the obscure, the beautiful and the odd.<br />Much has been written about the condition of the voice these days: Mitchell sings almost exclusively now in what was her mid-range. That, and the breathiness resulting from smoking are not so bad. The occasional sour note though is not so good.<br />A warning: this album takes repeated -- many repeated -- listenings to appreciate. Only then does its fabulousous start to shine through. It you're looking for lighter pop music to listen to half-heartedly, buy something else.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|This movie is the worst science fiction movie anyone could ever watch. It is boring, rediculous, and stupid. It doesn't even follow the original book. Don't waste the time or the money on this one. Just plain don't.
0780626494|5.0|Brendon Fraser and Alicia Silverstone give amazing performances in this movie, and the storyline is original and funny. It also looks at the world from a different perspective like Pleasantville did. It shows how sad the world became in 35 years from one point to the next. One of the best movies! This is a great romantic comedy and drama, and I reccomend it to anyone wanting to watch a good movie.
0060523794|1.0|This book puts in perspective what Gertsner did while at IBM. His callous disregard for employees and the lives of long hard working employees is obvious as he describes \\"How he made the Elephant dance\\". Sure, IBM was in trouble in the early 90's but IBM wasn't the only one, every company gets in trouble at some point. When the corporations realized that the PC was not going to replace mainframes, the turnaround was easy to implement and IBM was postured well when large capacity mainframes were required and necessary for the Fortune 500 to do reliable business. Was it necessary to throw out the principles that built IBM over 85 years into one of the most admired companies in the world? I think not, and now it is questionable of whether IBM will ever come back, to what it was before, a Great Company to work for and for the world community. Not mentioned in this book was that Gertsner walked away with $630,000,000 Million in net worth, gleaned in part from \\"creative accounting\\". His successor at American Express was one of four who determined his compensation, of which he has more than 600,000 stock options left to be exercised now that he has left IBM. This is a good book, about a man who has an ego as \\"Big as an Elephant\\" who did absolutely nothing to make IBM a better Corporation for the global economy. He just made money for himself and lots of it and this book is a sad attempt to justify his methods.
B000002B35|5.0|I feel sorry for the youngsters panning this album. They weren't at the house party in &quot;Almost Famous.&quot; They didn't spend '74 floating around in the back of a black-light van listening to DSOTM over and over, on an 8-track. They probably weren't even born in '74. So they just don't get it. Let 'em buy Eminem, or Kid Rock, or whoever the record companies are pushing these days.<br />I have every Floyd album; some I've bought several times over the years as formats changed. And I'm glad I got this one. And after this one, I got Roger Waters' &quot;In the Flesh,&quot; which is again mostly Floyd stuff, and some of the same tunes -- different enough for an afficionado to want both.<br />All your favorites are here, slightly reworked, expanded in some cases, still as excellent as ever. And if you like the end of the studio version of &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; you'll love this one -- it goes on and on and on! Of the several live versions of this classic, it's the best! And I don't mind the crowd noise -- on headphones it's almost like being there!<br />And if your red light stops blinking, you can just put in a new battery!<br />If you only own one Floyd album, this should be it!

He's enjoying the wind and the fresh air - until he notices the other waves in front of him, crashing against the shore. &quot;My God, this is terrible&quot;, the wave says. &quot;Look what's going to happen to me!&quot; Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave, looking grim, and is says to him, &quot;Why do you look so sad?&quot; The first wave says, &quot;You don't understand! We're all going to crash! All of us are going to be nothing! Isn't it terrible?&quot; The second wave says, &quot;No, YOU don't understand. You're not a wave, you're part of the Ocean.
0066214122|2.0|Michael Crichton's book contains two errors. On page 42 in the large print edition it is stated: &quot;We entered a vein, so the red cells are not oxygenated.&quot; The pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.  Not all veins are low in oxygen.  Also, on the same page it is written:  &quot;We're coming to the right atrium, and we should see the mitral valve.&quot;  Correction: The mitral valve is located between the Left Atrium and the Left Ventricle.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton's Prey was great - though I felt somewhat let down after finishing the book. The concepts, a cutting-edge-hi-tech amalgam of distributed computing, nanotech and genetic engineering (emergent self optimizing behaviour + triumphs of molecular manufacturing i.e. using e-coli bacteria to create nanoassemblers which inturn assemble molecular machines like cameras etc, which have memory, solar cell particles to sustain themselves and organize using goal-seeking PREDPREY distributed algorithms to mimick vivid shapes and forms, which as usual go out of control or do they. . . never mind; and have to be exterminated, else will take over the human race) are great, but the ending is not very inspiring and actually a bit disappointing. Killing the villain bacteria instantly with bacteriophages/viruses ? The content handling at times is dry and clumsy. Of course the story is fast paced and chilling too at times - he has focussed a lot on character development, which he was criticised of not doing in his earlier novels. The entire book is a first person narrative. All in all a score of 3.5/5 would suffice. His lucid style of writing though is prevalent here too, through which he seems to have developed a knack of scaring us ; readers will immediately vouch for the negative implications of molecular manufacturing . . .<br />Shamit
B00004U3UG|2.0|I have been a fan of the Evil Dead Trilogy for a few years now and when I heard the director's cut was coming out for Army of Darkness I made sure to pick it up.  Most of the time the transfer of the video is great, but whenever it shifts to the new bits added, the video quality becomes nothing short of horrible.  That really pulls me out of the movie and that knocks 2 stars off the score<br />It really is a shame they didn't take the extra effort to remaster the new scenes added in.  Hopefully the new \\"boomstick\\" edition due out in March will feature a vastly improved transfer, that would be reason enough for me to buy it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album totally rocks! I love her and her music, she is one of my #1 favorite singers. My favorite songs off of this awesome album is &quot;Complicated&quot; , &quot;Skater Boy&quot; , and &quot;I'm With You&quot;. Avril is #1! If you don't have this album then go out there and buy it!
B00005JKZT|5.0|It was brilliant decision to film the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in one continuous filming. The continuity with the Fellowship of the Ring is seamless. Some liberties and small changes are made but they are minor and the spirit of the books pervade the film. The epic scale is magnificent. One can sense the respect the cast andcrewhad for Tolkien story.<br />In Two Towers there are several different storylines that if handled badly can covalute the narrative. The editors did a great job in keeping the pacing up and the seperate adventures clear and concise. Other reviews have given the outline of the story rather well but special mention should be given to the character of Gollum who almost steals the film.<br />Joseph Campbell wrote on how certain themes in the mythology of almost all cultures are universal. The wandering prince, the battle of good vs evil, the commoner called to perform above and beyond, a band on a mission, etc etc. These themes are in both the Lord of the Rings books and the two movies are masterfully drawn. Because of the universality of its message, the Two Towers and the Fellowship of the Ring will remain popular for generations to come.
B000003TSP|5.0|Portishead only gets better as they go along. Dummy was an impressive debut, but uneven. This album starts out with one of their best songs, &quot;Cowboys&quot;, continues with the standout &quot;All Mine&quot; and simply keeps the standard of quality at its topmost level. If you liked Dummy, there's no reason why you should be disappointed with this notable improvement.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Truly one of the best films in recent years.  Stylized, breaktaking.  I often play it without sound just to have something so beautiful in the background.  An artistic marvel.
B00006RU5B|5.0|So it reads in the liner notes. <br />People, this isn't RAtM.  And it's not Soundgarden.  Taken independenly of its predecessors, Audioslave delivers on its own merit.<br />It's wailing, screaming, and rhythmically tight.  Cornell's lyrics carry the same anger, angst and much of the swagger that Soundgarden fans identify with.  As musicians, these four guys obviously worked hard to be in form.  Cornell's voice is the best I've heard since Badmotorfinger.<br />Audioslave bring undiluted, unadultered, loud and vital rock &amp; roll w/o a bunch of studio trickery or being pretentious.  Take it for what it is, music fans, and you'll find yourself snarling and flailing in unison with some of the most solid rock around.
B000069I1H|2.0|What can I say to this pathetic movie? This is a typical Eddie Murphy noisy movie, so noisy that I have to turn off the volume and  watched it in mute. Why Murphy is so similar almost in every of his movies? He's so noisy and annoying and just couldn't keep his big mouth shut a minute. This guy is not a good actor in the least, because he could only perform or act with his thick lips. De Niro also seemed to fail putting his heart in this movie, maybe just because he also wished that he'd be deaf to avoid the nuisance of Murphy's loud mouth. This is a terrible movie and it only makes me finally decide not to watch any new movie with Murphy in it, no matter what.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is brilliant,stunning,and all out amazing. The story line is rich and powerfull. And the anime drawings are very realistic. The lepers in the movie also add to the comical effect. QUOTE: Haha! I missed!
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica was the first band i ever listened to 3 years ago. Being only 12 then i thought it was ok but never showed that much interest. Now i am obsessed with them. Their best work by far is Master Of Puppets but this still hangs up their as one of their better albums. I like every metallica album for what it is. This is a great mix of thrash and metal with a slightly radio friendly touch. Though many so called metalheads claim that metal is not supposed to be radio friendly these guys are very good at proving that statement wrong. This album grows on you with every listen. This album has heavy riffs and thrashy metal very characteristic to Metallica except at a much slower pace. I guess everybody does get tired of headbanging sometime or the other. This isn't called selling out this is called maturing. Selling out is if you start singing pop with Britney Spears or Sheryl Crow which might be ok for someone like Kid Rock but c'mon this is metallica guys. They RULE. The Unforgiven is one of their best written songs of all times. They also show glances of their past thrash greatness in songs such as Sad But True and The Struggle Within but nothing in the level of greatness of Master Of Puppets and Ride The Lightning. Yet every song sticks with you like super glue. All in all this is a wonderful album for all types of music fans there is something for everyone with ballads such as Nothing Else Matters to Heavy Metal classics such as The Unforgiven, Enter Sandman etc..
0736041850|5.0|If you want to understand which muscles are involved in various common weight exercises this book gives right-on explanations in text and drawings.  It helps you to be aware of the muscle groups you are concentrating on, or can be used to select exercises or vary your routine.  For many exercises, the effect of variations is also mentioned.  E.g., what muscles are involved if I widen the grip, or increase the range of motion, etc.?<br />...
B00006JKOL|5.0|I said in my 7 January review (below) that I planned to buy the remastered version of this release even though I already had the older CD version. Well, I bought it, and I'm just submitting this follow-up review to say that I'm very, very glad I did.<br /><br />It's not just for the extra tracks, although those are nice. The two live tracks are no big deal; they're just the introductory acoustic portions of the two songs. Of the three studio tracks, two have been previously released and are of course good to have; \\"Pan Dance,\\" previously unreleased [or is it? see comments], is an instrumental featuring Ian Anderson's flute and a fine orchestral arrangement by David Palmer. All well worth having, at any rate.<br /><br />But the album itself is so good that it's worth having the remastered version just for the improved sound quality. I thought it was fine before, but compared to this one, the old one sounds like it was recorded through a bucket of mud. The remastering is so crisp, clean, and clear that you can hear every single sonic detail, from Anderson's acoustic guitar to Barrie Barlow's subtle percussion. And Martin Barre's electric guitar, which was penetrating enough on the older release, is now so sharp it's like an ice pick in your mind.<br /><br />There's also (as in all these recent remasterings) a short set of liner notes by Ian Anderson himself. The lyrics are included twice -- once in a copy of the old album insert, and once in a set of new pages. (It's good that they're both included, as the new pages inadvertently omit a verse here and there.)<br /><br />If you're a Tull fan, it's well worth picking up even if you already have the old one. Just thought you'd like to know.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I bought this recently on the strength of reviews here having never heard it before, though I have had Beck Ola and Truth since they came out as LPs, and have personally seen the Jeff Beck band in performance with lead singer Rod Stewart. I was not disappointed. This is a truly wonderful and totally original album of instrumental jazz rock fusion that really succeeds in carrying it off.<br />I have been a bit disappointed in some guitar albums I have listened to recently. For example, Santana's Caravanserai has way too much aimless noodling, displaying the weakness of the rock star who doesn't quite have whatever it is that you need  to do jazz, and Roy Rogers' Slideways shows you what happens when you have an instrumentalist who is not really a composer.<br />You could say the same about Beck, but the difference here, I think, is that this album was produced by Sir George Martin (the Beatles producer) and seems to be superbly balanced and arranged. There are even some strings at some point, but it is all very tasteful.<br />Anyway, I'm not going to comment track by track, and all I'm going to say is that this is a superb album.
B00005JLSC|5.0|What makes most movie musicals uninteresting to \\"average\\" movie goers is that they move too slowly, milking emotional moments into eons....Not so here.  The original play features nary an emotionally worthy character; they're all some version of a shabbychicago gangland stereotype.  Thus, all is fair in developing a fast-moving, mostly lightly sardonic look at three main characters.  You're not going to waste any actual feelings for these characters, so you have a lot of space to revel in the brilliant sensuality of the dancing/singing character development.  Please pay no attention to anyone who would suggest that there is insufficient substance; apparently we are being given permission to check our musical story expectations at the door and to wallow in craft so crafty that it's hard to miss what's missing.
B00005JLKN|5.0|I was nervous about this movie for many reasons - mainly because they did such a great job on Silence, and I thought Hannibal was great (I'm in the minority, I know), but I really wanted another installment of my favourite trilogy that I would never get bored of watching. To my great relief and undying gratitude, they pulled it off. The technical aspects of this movie are artful and expert, while the dramatic side also turned out beautifully. Somehow, they managed to complete the circle, and I will definitely watch this movie over and over again. There is even evidence of Lecter's character developing over *all three movies* if you care to pay some attention. What a piece of genius this movie is, I couldn't extol its virtues enough.<br />Even if you don't care for the rest of this story arc, this is a great standalone movie with a fantastic cast, all veteran actors who give the movie the feel of understated brilliance. The cinematography, lighting, direction, score - all excellent. I'd love to see multiple nominations for this one - Fiennes, Ratner and Elfman stand out in particular.
B00005JLSC|1.0|All I've heard about this film was positive, and today I finally went to see it.  My friend and I were both disappointed though. Other than John C. Reilly and Richard Gere, I felt the film was poorly casted.  It just didn't 'grab' me like other's.  I'm a fan of broadway musicals, and film as well, but this just didn't move me at all. Perhaps they should have handed this over to Baz?!
B000068PQ0|4.0|Having no knowledge of the Flaming Lips outside of their oddball hit single from years ago in \\"She Don't Use Jelly\\" I had no idea what to expect from this record when reading of it's critical acclaims. What I ended up getting was one of the most surprising, fulfilling albums I've come across to date. It's a neo-psychedelic pop masterwork that is even more rewarding in the long run than the short. What appears to be a loose concept record about a young girl, Yoshimi, and her battle against those \\"evil\\" robots as their called in the mesmerizing track \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1\\" is in the end quite touching thanks to the very sincere, solid lyrics of lead Lip Wayne Coyne. \\"Do You Realize??\\" ends up being possibly the best single of the year with it's hypnotic acoustic guitar underlay and touching lyrics. Each song is highlighted by an airy touch of electronic nuances that give the album a robotic feel, but still a very human one. I really can't say enough about how surprised I was at the brilliance of this album and each further Lips release will be very much anticipated.
0066214122|2.0|This book is such a quick read, it's apparent it was put together with cinema in mind.  The characters are so thinly developed, they have no substance or impact on the story.<br />As a reader of just about all his novels, this is the most disappointing of all.  However, as a reader of just about all his novels, he still got my $$$!
0151008116|3.0|I think a previous commentor pretty much sums up what I feel about this book. Martel is a marvelous writer and the book has squarely illuminating aims, but his execution is way off the mark. For the young and the unsure, its fresh perspective on faith may be insightful, but for those of us who are rooted with ration, if not reason in what we believe, it will more than likely do nothing. Still, though it fails to live up to its promise, three stars for a well told story.
B000002540|4.0|I really like the live cuts on this cd especially Last Days of May, Buck's boogie, Subhuman, cities on flame is done really well here, maserati gt is another good song. Hot rails to hell and the red and and black are done well here but I must admidt I like the live version of these two songs better on exterrestrial live. Maybe the only track not done well her is a redcap before the kiss. Worth it for Buck's boogie and Last days of may.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I just bought a new car,with a Fantastic CD player that holds 6CDs.Alot of the 6records have come and gone,but &quot;Nirvana&quot; will NEVER come out.From the opening track,the last one Kurt Cobain recorded on Jan.30,1994,&quot;You Know Your Right,&quot;to the ending number ,the David Bowie classic,&quot;The Man Who sold the World,&quot; I can't think of one outstanding song,because there ALL OUTSTANDING.I don't have Nirvana's first record,&quot;Bleach,&quot; but after hearing &quot;About a Girl,Silver,&quot;and my favorite cut from the album,&quot;Been a Son,&quot; I MUST get this CD also.There is  1 song  I wish that was included on this collection,&quot;Milk It,&quot; for the CD,&quot;In Utero,&quot;but I LOVE this ALBUM,and it will NEVER come out of my CD Player.
B000001ESN|5.0|A lot of people have probaly heard freewil and spirti of the radio, but the other four songs on this cd are excellent, too. Natural Science a longer song but has great flow thorughout, Entre Nous a little more light heated side another excellent song, Different Strings great lyrics excelllent song, and Jacob's Ladder excellent song and great finish. One of their best cd's
4789009637|5.0|I have purchased Genki I and Genki II (and the workbooks).  I am very pleased with the books.  They provide the student with invaluable information, and present the material in a logical order.  I have used other college texts in the past, but they pale in comparison with this series. If you are looking for an excellent introduction to the Japanese language, look no further.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Ok, I know what you're thinking.  I just got this new Opeth cd, its called Deliverence.  \\"Wow this is really heavy!\\"  No. Duh.  They announced they were releasing a heavy album and a mellow album.  At first listen, you think they are totally death metal now.  You're wrong.  They don't even have a genre.  They are Opeth, a genre that elludes and personifies what everyone wants out of music.  Intense riffage interspersed with God-like melodies and clean vocals.  \\"Wreath\\" has just ended, and you don't know what to think after hearing brutal drums at first and then bongos half way through.  Then the title track emerges out of your speakers.  You warm up to it, because it warms up to you.  It continues and you're hoping it doesn't end.  Then, it gets to the closing riff.  You are in a trance now, intoxicated by music.  You've never heard anything like this.  Holy... poo.  It ends, you catch your breath to the next track \\"A Fair Judgement.\\"  Beautiful. Pure magnificence.  The song came out of nowhere and you don't want it to leave.  But sadly it is only 10 and a half minutes long.  Then comes an interlude instrumental by the name of \\"For Absent Friends.\\"  If you don't appreciate music, you won't like this song.  If you can sit in a seat for more than 30 seconds without wanting to eat a rabbit, you will love this short piece.  Then, out of Nowhere, Alaska comes \\"Master's Apprentices.\\"  It's heavier than your fat Aunt Helga, but somehow you love it just like you love her.  Give it time and let it sink in.  The cd is not over, even though you've invested about 50 minutes of your near worthless existence.  There is still a 13 minute charm named \\"By the Pain I See in Others.\\"  It starts, you like.  It continues, he adds vocal effect, you don't know what to think, yet you're still intrigued.  Then it goes into some sort of circus riff.  You remember calling this death metal, ... and Opeth are their own genre.  You now like this song.  In fact, you liked this whole cd, just likeevery other song that Opeth ever released.  If you don't buy this, stop listening to music. Peace.
0790746905|5.0|&quot;Classic&quot; is a term brandished about too frequently but &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is a film worthy of that recognition. This is an intelligent, well-written, and paced well with few lapses in action. The special effects, while dated in comparison to today's computer-generated wonders, are still impressive.<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon, who during the 40's had starred in several popular MGM films, adds just the right amount of authority to his role as the enigmatic Dr. Morbius. Leslie Nielson, who would later garner greater fame in his sidesplitting comic roles of the 80's and 90's, is present in all his &quot;leading man/serious&quot; glory.<br />The electronic score by Bebe and Louis Baron is a one-of-a-kind listening experience, otherworldly and provocative. It is obviously a work that provided 50's movie patrons with something unheard of before.<br />Besides the previously mentioned actors, the movie also features performers who would later regularly appear on primetime television: Jack Kelly (&quot;Maverick&quot;), Earl Holliman (Angie Dickinson's boss on &quot;Police Woman&quot;), Anne Francis (the 60's &quot;Honey West&quot;), Richard Anderson (&quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;), James Drury (TV's long running &quot;The Virginian&quot;) and in a very small role, James Best who would later find fame on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.
B00004R997|1.0|Disney felt they had to censor Goofy's smoking.  Like some idiot is really going to start smoking because of a cartoon.  The reason I like old films is because they are from a time when the world wasn't PC.  I hope someday in the future Disney releases an uncut version.  The same way the release Dragonball.  Edited version & uncut version
B0000797IO|1.0|I watched this movie with 3 other adults, and none of us liked it.  We wanted to turn it off after the first 15 minutes, but decided to give it a fair chance.  It wasn't worth it!  All of us like different kinds of movies, but we could barely keep our eyes open.  It wasn't funny, it didn't pull at your heartstrings, but it does make your mind go numb.  Plot?  What is that?  Maybe I'll send this movie to my worst enemy so THEY can be tortured.  I usually like Jennifer Aniston, but this script was terrible.
6305226296|5.0|I watch this video now with bittersweet memories of the first time I saw it and I have great and gain new memories everytime I DO watch it now.

B000002UA0|5.0|The British psychedelic bands knew what to do with this genre,while American hippie bands bored us to tears with fairly regular country blues jam nonsense. The Floyd were cream of the crop and they created a mood, a bizarre one that defines psychedelia. Barrett's other worldly lyrics take you away to the far corners of a twisted mind on LSD, while the production is just amazing,beyond what The Beatles or anyone were doing at the time. It would have been nice to see how Syd would have developed as a mature songwriter,but maybe it's a good thing that his output was small,making it all the more special. I originally owned this as part of the two record set A Nice Pair,coupled with Saucerful Of Secrets. I played those records to death as a high schooler. The version of \\"Astronomy Domine on A Nice Pair was the live one from Ummagumma, not the original studio one contained here,which was an odd move. The remasters of Piper and Saucer are far better than the first CD versions issued in the 80's. If you still have those get on the ball and update. Piper is Floyd's best album and a celebration of the genius of one Roger Syd Barrett.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|(Forget) DARE, watch this movie!!!<BR> If you want a happy ending or a sugar coated view of the drug world this is not the movie for you. However, if you want a movie that beautifully displays the purest interpretation of drugs I have ever seen in a movie, this movie is where you'll find it. It shows the the highpoints as well as some of the most drastic lows that can be found in the drug world. Though controvertial to no end, I would suggest showing this film to highschool aged kids as a drug deterent tool. It certainly did more for me than any funded drug resistance program I have seen.<BR> Beyond the reality check this movie gives, special attention should be paid to the extreme mastery of film the director displays throughout the entire movie. <BR> By far the most serious roll I have seen Marlon Wayans play, he pulls it off extremely well showing his skill as more than just another comedic actor. And we can't go without mentioning the beautiful Jennifer Connelly... she has definately grown up since her roll in Labrynth something like 10 years prior. <BR> Taking in great acting, directing, and a beautiful story line it should lastly be noted how incredible the score is for this movie, through listening to the music you really feel the power this movie puts out. <BR> I can rant and rave about this movie for days and days, but I can put as simple as this... If you like a thinker movie with a real, true life base, it will be extremely hard to find anything better than Requiem for a Dream. Buy it today and after seeing it once you will be telling all your friends how badly they need to watch it as well.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The quality of the picture and the sound on the DVD is high.  The movie itself is destined to become a Sci Fi classic.  In my opinion, the musical score is John Williams' best work, except for Star Wars.  Stanley Kubrick, who had started work on this project many years earlier only to realize that computer animation at the time hadn't yet caught up to his vision of the film, resurrected it in the late 1990s with the intention of producing the movie and having Steven Spielberg direct.  Shortly after the two men began their collaberation, Kubrick died.  Spielgerg's final product has the feel of a Kubrick film, with a few Spielberg touches.  I think Stanley would have been very happy with it.
B00003CXDD|4.0|Willow borrows from a lot of sources, in many ways more heavily from the Bible than from Lord of the Rings. The story of the slaughter of babies, Elora's escape in a floating cradle, and discovery by Willow's family is drawn from Moses's story. <br />Unoriginal? Maybe, but it's done in Fantasy all of the time.<BR>(Tolkien, by the way, peopled the Lord of the Rings with elements drawn from European and Christian mythology himself.)<BR>Tolkien may have written the definative fantasy epic, but he didn't invent the genre. Now all of you calm down.<br />Willow is a good movie with fun charachters and one of the best scores I've ever heard. Not a great movie, but very watchable.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest album of our lives. Kurt captures the spirit of the nineties with songs like 'in bloom' 'lithium' 'come as you are' and probably the rest of the songs on Nevermind.<BR>This ground breaking album is Nirvana at it's best. The use of Dave grohls aggressive drumming, Kurts ingenious lyrics and Novoselic's superb bass is unique. <BR>Nothing wrong can be said about Nevermind. The songs play sharply and smoothly. There's a strange feeling Nevermind is the greatest hits of a band. There isn't a weak song on the whole album.<BR>Never again will there be an album like Nevermind or a band like Nirvana. <BR>If there is just one album you ever buy make sure it is this one.
B00004W52U|5.0|Listen up Blink, Sum 41 fans, because THIS is what you're bands WISH they could sound like. <br />Operation Ivy is by far the best Ska/REAL Punk band. AWESOME Bass, AWESOME Vocals, and ska chords at their finest. You need this CD
B000069HKH|5.0|really enjoyed this cd--springsteen fan from way back (before born to run...am I dating myself?)--I have not liked a lot of his solo stuff, however, and this albumn is a return stylistically to earlier times with e-street band.  The songs, however, show considerable growth and reflect the stuff us middle-aged types are dealing with.  Except for &quot;Mary's place&quot; (what the heck is it with bruce and the name &quot;mary&quot;?) an annoying bit of fluff, I liked every song on cd.
B00006V9A0|3.0|If your going to call this a &quot;BEST OF&quot; album, at least put on some of their best songs, not just the ones they released. This cd definately does not capture Nirvana the way I think they'd want. <br /> <br />I think they should've put up an online poll or talked to some real Nirvana fans and found out some fan favourites to put on a best of cd. <br /><br />5 songs not found on this album:<BR><BR>1-Radio Friendly Unit Shifter --&gt; my fave nirvana song, but not too far ahead of...<BR><BR>2-Drain You --&gt; a frickin wicked song, and i know its a fan fave<BR><BR>3-Breed --&gt; another great song that the general public doesnt know exists<BR><BR>4-Territorial Pissings --&gt; i love it...untouchable and a true gem ( i cant believe i just said &quot;true gem&quot;)<BR><BR>5-Serve the Servants --&gt; okay, not a GREAT nirvana song but its still good. Good lyrics.<BR><br /><BR>I think most people think of Nirvana as the band who played &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. But Nirvana changed alot of peoples lives and the way people view all music. Punk, rock, pop, every genre has changed because of how Kurt, Krist and Dave played and smashed their instruments. I just wish i was old enough to see them live before Kurt was killed. Oh, sorry, he supposedly killed himself...yea thats wut happened eh Courtney?<BR><BR>But that's not the point. The point is they should release an ACTUAL best of album with some of Nirvana's best songs. This cd's good to get though if you don't really know Nirvana but want to get into them.<br />
B00005R87Q|4.0|\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is, if nothing else, the ultimate guy flick: full of fast cars, hot chicks, and macho dudes who beat each other up before bonding over barbecue and Coronas. <br />It is a testosterone-fueled, pumped, hyperkinetic dude fantasy that draws on old `60s and 70s chase films like \\"Bullitt\\" and \\"Grand Theft Auto,\\" but adds a rewarding layer of character and relationship depth. <br />Mind you, when we're talking about character depth, we're not talking about \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" here, but unlike recent car-chase flicks like \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds,\\" we at least understand what drives the relationships. Heck, we see that there are relationships.<br />The central relationship revolves around Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker). The former is a street racer who has a side business hijacking trucks; the latter is an undercover cop who infiltrates Toretto's gang. Of course, there's a male bonding experience here - Toretto beats O'Connor in a race (run through curiously traffic-free Los Angeles streets), and afterwards O'Connor saves Toretto from being picked up by the police. <br />Soon thereafter, O'Connor is more or less accepted into Toretto's gang, and while the central purpose of of this is to bust the gang, O'Connor finds himself becoming friends with his intended collars, and drawn into the alluring world of street racing. He also falls in love with Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), even though that would seem to violate every rule known to undercover police work.<br />Of course, \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" isn't a realistic crime caper; if it were, would Toretto's gang really rip off trucks while they're moving? Their method is to surround the truck with a small flotilla of hopped-up compact cars, shoot a rope from one of the cars into the cab of the truck, and use the rope as a bridge to jump onto the truck. From there, I suppose it'd be a matter of gaining entry into the cab, subduing the driver, and stealing the truck.Now, all this is pretty exciting stuff on screen, but hasn't it occurred to Toretto that it'd just be easier to rip off the truck when it's parked?<br />But realism isn't the point here - adrenaline is, and \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" delivers just that, with a healthy dollop of style and testosterone. Enjoy the movie, but just don't think about it too much.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is an awesome, must own rock album in every sense! Dave Grohl is in top notch on the drums, he is excellent here exibiting some of his best work. The leadsinger and the other band members work well together to form an excellent combination and to create an awesome rock record. Every single track is excellent, and I even like the radio station bits. Six Shooter shows some of the bands harder more raw sound while the Mosquito song displays them at a melodic, dreamy pace. This is one of the best bands playing rock today and if you enjoy rock or metal this is a must own record!
B000002JS8|4.0|Highway to Hell was the end of AC/DC's finest era, and while it was a fitting end to a stellar and tragically short career at the helm for Bon Scott, it was not their finest effort. People claim that this was AC/DC's finest hour, but, unfortunately this was AC/DC's first major breakthrough into the mainstream music scene, and thus their earlier, more energetic works are often lost in the coverage of Back in Black and Highway to Hell. Here is my breakdown of each song:<BR>1. Highway to Hell: an immortal rock song, and one of the CD's better moments. For some reason, for me anyways, the singing is by far the highlight of the song, as opposed to the guitar riff, which is unusual for an AC/DC song, but this was one of Bon's greatest moments.<BR>2. Girl's Got Rhythm: the first time I listened to it, I was hooked on the opening riff, however, the more I listen to it, the more it starts to get on my nerves. This is one of the very few times that Bon's normally great scream is just a little too over the top.<BR>3. Walk All Over You: a very slow, tedious opening, and then it just misses that catchy element that constitutes a great AC/DC song.<BR>4. Touch Too Much: slightly better than Walk All Over You, however, this was still not AC/DC at it's finest, most energetic peak. However, that was to come with the next song.<BR>5. Beating Around the Bush: GREAT song! Just try finding a song with more raw energy and charismatic appeal. Except for maybe Rocker, never has AC/DC pushed the borders of pure, manic guitar playing. Just a fantastic guitar riff, and some equally enthusiastic singing from Bon Scott.<BR>6. Shot Down in Flames: another great effort from the group here. This is a song where it's apparent that there will never be another Bon Scott. Some more catchy guitar playing from the Brothers Young.<BR>7. Get It Hot: not quite as strong as two songs before it, however, still decent, which of course makes it better than 75% than what other band's make, but as far as AC/DC'sstandards, they've done better. This is along the same lines as Shot Down in Flames as far as tempo.<BR>8. If You Want Blood (You've Got It): contrary to Highway to Hell and Girls Got Rhythm, this has an absolutely immortal guitar riff. Enough said. This song is an absolute classic, on the basis of the classic guitar line alone.<BR>9. Love Hungry Man: this is often reputed to be the worst on the album, however, I prefer this song to Walk All Over You and Touch Too Much. But make no mistake, this is definitely nothing but filler.<BR>10. Night Prowler: a very eerie finish to the CD, and a decent song. Overall though, it pales in comparison to Beating Around the Bush and If You Want Blood, but, along with Ride On from Dirty Deeds, proves that AC/DC could manufacture a good slower song.<BR>Overall, this CD is good, but not great by AC/DC standards. What it does have going for it was Bon Scott, and a couple of moments of pure genius from the Youngs. But other than that, it basically earned a star for Beating Around the Bush, a star for If You Want Blood, a star for Shot Down in Flames, and half a star each for Highway to Hell and Night Prowler. All in all, any AC/DC collection needs this album, but don't choose this over other efforts such as Let There Be Rock and High Voltage.
B000002L9S|5.0|This album is less dance and more Pop than her previous ones. I like most of the songs but I don't understand why she put just 9 songs on it. <BR>Papa don't preach: Not my favourite Madonna song but the lyrics about teenage-pregnancy are well written.<BR>Open your heart: I love this dancesong. The best on the album.<BR>White heat: Not my song but it'S not bad.<BR>Live to tell: A truly great ballad. Only Madonna can sing such songs.<BR>Where's the party: The title says it: A funsong.<BR>True blue: A sweet, sappy lovesong. I like it.<BR>La isla bonita: This song was and is a big radio hit over here.  She tries to do latin.<BR>Jimmy Jimmy: Oh no, That's so stupid. One of her worst songs ever.<BR>Love makes the world go round: A song abbout war, hunger, hatred and more. Great.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|A beautifully told tale of an immature man and a too-mature boy.<BR>Hugh Grant takes his &quot;shtick&quot;, such that it is, and uses it to fill out a fairly detailed character. It's completely three-dimensional. By the end of the movie, you feel you yourself could answer totally unrelated questions about this character...like what would be his political views? Beatles or Presley? Big Mac or McChicken?<BR>The boy never once seems to be acting, and is laugh-out-loud funny. He tosses them off almost like afterthoughts, yet you'll pause-and-&quot;rewind&quot; just to hear his delivery over and over again.<BR>The superlative screenplay, and the surprising zippy direction from the Weitz brothers (&quot;American Pie&quot; to this? Wow.) will have non-cineastes noticing.<BR>One last thing. The soundtrack is sheer perfection, by a guy named Badly Drawn Boy. It's evocative but not intrusive, classic/retro-sounding yet totally modern and contemporary, and hummable beyond belief.<BR>From top to bottom, this is one of the best films of 2002.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I had this album on a cassette that was copied from a album, needless to say, it lacked quality, but it still was my favorite album while I was growing up, and it sat right beside my early Metallica and Anthrax (along with Seals and Croft's Greatest Hits), sticking out like a sore thumb as most reviewers have said (except I am younger). I can't wait to get this version on CD, I've been listening to it online fom a download site all this time, but have decided to re-add it back into my collection. I've missed it sorely. Highly recommended for EVERYONE! Doesn't matter what genre you normally listen to, this album is THAT good! Cat's voice has a unique sound and I love his guitar style, powerful \\"happy music\\" (compared to the Pantera, Tool, and Megadeth I listen to now).
0316666343|5.0|This book made me cry. Now, I'm not the type for weepy, sentimental novels. A book that tells the truth of humanity in a clear, uncluttered voice truly moves me. Alice Sebold has accomplished that here. The tale is told through the eyes of a murdered teen. As she watches her family--and her killer--from 'heaven' (a place where, happily, cats and dogs go, too, and your heaven overlaps with other heavens so everybody gets what they want AND they get to see the ones they love--and you even get a counselor to help you make the transition into 'deadness!!') we see the painful aftermath of a family living with an unsolved murder over their heads. I was angry throughout, thinking there would never be justice for this spunky girl's untimely death, but in the end, rest assured, there is. Folks, this book is worth it. It isn't drippy and sappy, but it will probably make you cry. Read it.
B000001IPL|5.0|Even though &quot;Smash&quot; may have been one of the albums (along with Green Day's &quot;Dookie&quot;) to bring punk to the mainstream (and introduce countless pop wanna be punk bands of today like Blink 182 and Sum 41), it is one of the finest albums ever recorded and shows The Offspring at their best musically.  Just about every track; from the hilarious intro &quot;Time to Relax&quot;, to the turbo charged &quot;Nitro (Youth Energy)&quot;, and the rock radio staples &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; and &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, &quot;Smash&quot; is a one of a kind must have album that is perfect punk three chord progression and has actual meaningful lyrics that speaks to an entire generation.  And yes, even though it is a single and a radio staple as well, &quot;Self Esteem&quot; is reason enough to own &quot;Smash&quot;.  All in all, if your just into rock music in general, put down that blasted &quot;Americana&quot; album and give this a spin, you won't regret it.
B00006RIO7|5.0|That seemed like the appropriate exclamation for this stellar soundtrack, taking place seventy or so years ago. Actually, it should be something more of a four-letter variety, but this is an all-ages website, no?<BR>You will buy this CD if:<BR>a) you love great movies<BR>b) you love great Broadway<BR>c) you love great musicals<BR>You HAVE to. Here's why.<BR>First, Richard Gere is great in the film, but better here, because he's really acting with his voice, and your preconceptions associated with his physical appearance disappear. His nasal smarminess fits.<BR>Second, Catherine Zeta-Jones just leaps out of your speakers, brassy and bold.<BR>Third, and I think most important, is Renee Zellweger's performance. Her range from a coquettish purr to a full-throated roar is staggering. You will be scratching your head, saying, &quot;I had no idea...&quot;<BR>Furthermore, the other supporting players...to a T...are perfection, and unexpectedly so. Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly nail their parts with assurance, and the ensemble piece &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; literally raises the roof.<BR>Lastly, the musicianship is impeccable. The arrangement are snappy and tight, and perfectly intertwined with the vocal performances. During musical interludes, you can almost hear voices singing along, and during vocal passages, it's hard not to &quot;fill in&quot; extra background music in your head...<BR>So...if you've seen the movie, you need this.<BR>If you haven't seen the movie, go right now. But if you get this FIRST, I guarantee that wild horses will not be able to keep you away from the theatre. <BR>By the way, don't bother with the &quot;extra&quot; tunes. They're superfluous. Although I wish I could have heard Janet Jackson's take on this material, as it was rumored early on she would contribute an extra track...
B0000797IO|1.0|the good girl is a good movie to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do.That would also include root canal work.it should have been titled the adultress bored wife.aniston may be in a good movie someday but this isnt it.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|...  This concert, which was filmed at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is incredible; but of course we've come to expect nothing less from Andre Rieu. As usual his interaction with the audience and comical antics are what \\"make\\" his concerts so special.  This DVD has something for everyone and the excitement generated by the audience is contagious.  Although the sound quality did not appear to be the best, (compared with others that I have), the DVD is well worth the purchase and will reward viewers with many repeated hours of sheer listening and viewing enjoyment.
B000003TAB|4.0|Though &quot;Incesticide&quot; may be a collection of B-sides and one shots by Nirvana, this songs on this collection actually sound as if they are bleeding into one another and &quot;Incesticide&quot; as a whole sounds like an actual album.  &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Stain&quot;, &quot;Been a Son&quot;, &quot;Molly's Lips&quot;, &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Downer&quot; are all great songs that showcase Kurt Cobain and co.'s angst and songwriting talent that would eventually propell them to never before thought of heights.  Forget bands like Creed, Puddle of Mudd, Staind, Nickelback, and all the rest, &quot;Incesticide&quot; is just a testament of the beginning of an era that would end in tragedy.  All in all, fans of Nirvana who have missed out on &quot;Incesticide&quot; should pick this up.
B00005JK8K|4.0|If you were to write the plot out on a sheet of paper, this movie could have been made any time after WWII. It's a standard...standard as in &quot;classic&quot;, not standard as in &quot;routine&quot;. Granted, it tries for a bit more depth, but for the most part, it's one guy trying to protect another guy, and everybody has issues that for the most part are written on their forehead in crayon.<BR>&quot;So what?&quot; I say. You always knew who John Wayne was, didn't you? John Ford's supporting cast was remarkably constant, as was the character each guy played. No big deal.<BR>This time, the war movie classic gets the John Woo treatment, with flying bodies and bullets, huge explosions, and those operatic action sequences you've come to expect and love. Did I miss the doves?<BR>This is not the modern war movie reinvented, it's an old-fashioned war movie updated. And as such I though it was pretty damn good!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Everyone has a favorite flick. And not everyone agrees on the choices made. But most people agree that the greatest film ever made is &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; that thinly-veiled expose of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. In fact, the flick was voted the No. 1 spot in the American Film Institute's 1998 list of Best American Movies. To commemorate its 60th anniversary, the movie has finally been released on DVD in a magnificent digital transfer with revitalized audio. A second disk contains the<br />Oscar-nominated documentary, &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane,&quot; as well as a slew of bonus tracks, including the theatrical trailer, rare photos and the 1942 movie premiere newsreel.<br />Several other DVD sets are worthy of five stars---and repeated viewings.
B00005JKNF|2.0|To really understand the film \\"Gosford Park\\" you need to know that in the 1970s the scriptwriter, actor Julian Fellows, was augmenting his salary as a thespian by trotting out romance novels under the pseudonym \\"Rebecca Greville\\".<br />And that, for all the hype and Oscars, is what \\"Gosford Park\\" really is - a tarted up, upper crust romance novel, with all the attendent shortcomings of that genre.<br />The cast list is absolutely \\"top drawer\\", and they do the best they can with what is ultimately a totally meaningless vacuous script.  (I was going to say \\"plot\\", but in the final analysis the script is neither substantial enough nor coherent enough to warrant such a description).<br />The film basically concerns a group of society twits who come together for a weekend house party in the 1930s, and the staff who wait upon them.  During the weekend someone gets killed, the police arrive, the murder is solved, and the guests go home.  Roll credits.<br />Do we learn anything of any consequence about any of the characters?  Far from it.  In fact the characters are uniformly two dimensional, including such tired old stereotypes as the buxom but stupid housemaid who offers her sexual services to any male member of the houseparty who cares to take advantage of them; and a detective so affably bumbling that he'd have a hard time finding his way INTO a brown paper bag, let alone out again.<br />If there'd been any genuine humour in it, this could at least have been labelled as a \\"comedy of manners\\".  Unfortunately it is as boring as the house guests, and as transparent as the so-called murder mystery.<br />Bottom line: a totally fatuous waste of time and money for cast, crew and audience alike.

0316666343|4.0|I thought it was very nicely written and it moved me somewhat.  Suppose most who read it will like it, but there is just something missing that becomes a classic.  By the end I didn't feel as if I had met any people I'd like to contimue to know.
0060278269|5.0|Cross a magical wall and enter the realm of the Old Kingdom, the home of Charter and Free Magic, where the dead walk, kept bound only by the powerful Aborsen. But the Abhorsen Sabriel has been lured across the wall to the unmagical kingdom of Ancelsterie with her husband, the King, leaving the Old Kingdom virtually unprotected from the Dead, evil necromancers, and Orannis, (an evil spirit of great power). However, all is not lost, for four unlikely heroes join against this evil. Lirael,(a Remembrancer, a Daughter of the Clair and Abhorsen-in-Waiting) Sam, (a Prince and an inheritor of the Wall-Makers' power) the Disreputable Dog (Lirael's companion) and Mogget (a unwilling servant of the Aborsen trapped as a white cat) must somehow defeat Orranis in time to save not only the Old Kingdom, but the whole world.<br />\\"Abhorsen\\" answers many questions from \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\", (such as the true identities of Mogget and Dog) though it still leaves a sense of mystery. I hope Garth Nix continues this series. If he does, I'll be the first in line for the next book!<br />P.S. If Mr. Nix is reading this, I have a few questions that I'd like answered. <BR>    <BR>What happens to Chloor, and what are the secrets of her past? (Nix hinted that she used to be Abhorsen.)<BR>      <BR>How did Lirael's mother die?<br />I have a lot more questions, but only 1,000 words are allowed. Mr. Nix, pleeeaaassse write another book about Lirael and the Old Kingdom!!!
1577311523|3.0|One of the main lessons of \\"Enlightenment\\" is that life goes on after \\"Enlightenment\\".  <br />On page 74 it states that \\"the sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better.\\"<BR>This is because \\"every outer purpose is doomed to \\"fail\\" sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things.\\"  Just a tad pessimistic, eh?<br />While impermanence is \\"true\\" on one level, there is something else, even more \\"true\\" called: when you learn to ride the wave of impermanence, you become one with impermanence (another word for constant change) and are able to make it's so called \\"negative\\" effects  disappear.  In other words you become an actual living evolving being.  NOW you become a learner, except now you take the ecstacy with you as you learn and change.  \\"Enlightnment\\" is just the first step!  What, did you think you were just going to become some monk on a hill somewhere?  Nah!  Now its time to use your mind instead of \\"trying to rise above it\\" and all that stuff.  Step into the unknown, with pleasure.  Be in the now, or not....it's up to you.  Create a worthwhile future NOW.<br />If you enjoy getting \\"all profound and stuff\\" this book will be a fun read.

6302968135|5.0|this is one of the must see movies for all chicanos, and people interested in the culture. it is realistic, filled with drama and action. the story line is great, each character has something we all could relate to.<br />paco and miklo seem to be on different sides of the chicano culture, with miklo being filled with the pride and &quot;power&quot;. bt as paco puts it, he is only filled with his white fathers hate. but he accepts gang life as chicano culture. he doesnt run from his past. paco, hates his past and finds it difficult to relate to that. he is hard as a rock with his emotions, never really letting himself go until the end.<br />cruz has to be somewhere in between. he is by far my favorite character. he is the interpreter of the culture, filled with  the lots of knowledge about our culture's past and present. he doesnt run from the past and accepts his mistakes. ( side note i think he kinda looks like jimmy smits)<br />i only have a couple of problems with this movie. for one i found miklo's acting to be a bit less than great at times. and ouch my ears hurt to hear miklo and paco speak spanish. they did fine in english, but their spanish was pretty bad. but these were just minor annoyances for me. i love this movie and i think it is a must for any chicano movie collection.
0066214122|4.0|There is no Crichton fan who will be able to say this is his best, because it is not.  I am a a lawyer with a pre-med degree so obviously Chrichton and other physicians in writing draw me.

Still love the guy though.
0446677450|5.0|I have read more than a half dozen reviews (probably same person) attributing the success to Rich Dad, Poor Dad to network marketing (MLM).I don't know if there is any truth to that or not, but I sure hope so.You see, I just signed up into a MLM company (not Amway) and if MLM can turn a book into a mega best aeller like some people have indicated, then that certaintly prooves the power of network marketing.And obviously Network Marketing (MLM) is far more powerful than that cheesy, supposedly well researched (it's not) website that gets getting mentioned here or the constant barrage of 1 star bashers (really just one person with a attitude problem) and obviously more successful than the self publishing industry.Thanks to RD/PD, I have reorganized my investments, started a successful business and am sharing this info with family and friends.1 star reviewer (s), get a life already!
B000002G7E|5.0|There's more to listen to in &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, the Velvet's sophomore effort, than in any of their other albums. The songwriting can't compare to that of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; or their 1969 self-titled masterpiece, but that clearly isn't the focus here. The band had dropped Andy Warhol (and his &quot;Chanteuse&quot; Nico), whose candy-pop production of their debut left a lot to be desired. The band self produced this one, and by the first second into the opening title track, ther's already a world of difference. The clanging piano chords, guitars drenched in overdrive, and steady thick bass create the sound everyone knew they could achieve.   <BR>          After recording this album, John Cale would leave the band, but not without leaving his mark on WLWH. His trademark screaching violin is prominantly placed throughout the album, and his vocals on &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation&quot; are terrific.<BR>          The album closes with &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, what many call the Velvet's anthema. Although it works better live, the studio version is a monumental achievement as well. Lou Reed's glazed monotone tells the story of a New York transvestite prostitute/heroin addict against a wall of feedback and fever-pitch organ. It builds up until the climax spasms out of control, unable to travel any further and it dies.<BR>           The Velvets never created another album like &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, nor should they have; any further in this directon would have created something the band could not have controlled or understood. It would not have been music, merely chaos (refer to &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;).

B00000DGRX|5.0|This was my first (and so far the only) Deep Purple album I've bought, and let me tell you, it is simply awesome to listen to! The first CD in the set is good, but I find myself listening to the second (Roger Glover Remixes) CD the most often. This is Purple that's as close to &quot;raw&quot; as you can get, and it still sounds great! This CD is perfect for a road trip. Take &quot;Highway Star&quot; as a prime example. What's the first track on the CD about? cruising the Open Road! And it keeps getting better, with &quot;Maybe I'm A Leo,&quot; &quot;Pictures Of Home,&quot; &quot;Smoke On The Water,&quot; &quot;Lazy,&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin'&quot; all contributing to the feeling of a great, long ride! There are literally no bad songs on this album, in my opinion. Definitely buy this CD set, you won't be sorry!
0689835604|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL book.  It satisfies my daughter's great love for peek a boo and naming and searching for different body parts.  No matter how many times we read this book, she always acts \\"surprised\\" to see what is underneath the flap and finds great fun in searching for her own belly button or hands (or whatever the page says).  The flaps are sturdy and have withstood my \\"toddler's terror\\" even after reading this book over...and over...and over...  You and your little one will love this one.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Not only is the casting astounding, but the overall message is profound.  The movie portrays anti-drug sentiments AND the \\"glamour\\" of euphoria.  It details the despair that 4 people enter as drugs and addictions take over their lives.

It's hard to believe they aren't really on drugs...

B00006CXXU|5.0|This talent has been allowed to remove the conventional pop diva restraints.  While it was obvious that Christina could sing as previous efforts proved, there always seemed something incongruent with the lyrics vs. the voice.  Stripped allows us to hear what Christina is actually feeling while showcasing her incredible vocal range and power at once.  There is something for everyone on this CD.  There are grinding dance beats of Get Mine, Get Yours and Dirty along with power ballads dripping with ache and desperation in Walk Away and the collaboration with Alicia Key's on Impossible.  There is a definite Latin flavor on Infatuation with its lovely undertones that bring to mind love on Puerto Rican shores. And let's not forget the simply painful but hopeful anthem of Beautiful which tells the tale of many young girls' struggle with self image.  Stripped's lyrics tell a familiar story but her delicious voice narrates it in a way not yet heard.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana are simply an awesome band, and this is a great album to own if you haven't heard Nirvana before, but it could still use a LOT more songs then this. In any case, this cd contains most of their best songs, so it's good disc for newbies. Like I said, Nirvana is a great band, but they are simply overrated because there were many bands like them during their time that just did not get the recognition like Nirvana did. In any case, Nirvana will always be remembered for getting rid of that glam rock ..., with the exception of Guns and Roses, who still kick ***. By the way, \\"You Know Your Right\\", is one kick-*** song.
0679735909|5.0|I'm reading this book again and came here to see what others thought. This if one of my favorite modern novels, at so many levels. I love the way Byatt uses language, its density and grace; love the way the two stories meet and intertwine. Many people are mis-reading the subtitle of &quot;A Romance.&quot; Read the Hawthorne quote that begins the book: &quot;[A romance] has . . . a right to present . . . truth under cirumstances . . . of the writer's own choosing or creation. . . . The point of view in which this tale comes under the Romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us.&quot; And, please, don't skip the writings of Ash and Christabel--their poetry and descriptions are beautiful and glorious (another facet of Byatt); their story strengthens the story of Maud and Roland. Allow yourself to become lost in this rich tale.
B000002MP2|5.0|I think it is safe to say that the first time i fell in love, it was with Dookie. A young pilgram of 12 years I was, and tired of being forced to like all the other \\"Rap\\" and \\"R&B\\" jams on the radio. This was the first C.D. that I listened to all the way through, and actually liked very well; in fact loved. And the most amazing part is, is that it withstands the test of time, while also acting as a perfect snapshot of the small revolution that took place in 1994.  We were tired of grunge-rock-stars talking about how they did not want fame, and at the same time, secretly wishing for it. With the release of Dookie, Green Day rode the crest of new style and punk-pop, that would later melt into some kind goofy hybrid of stand-up comedy and music that Blink 182 made  famous. ( i really dont care for Blink all that much by the way) But no one did it better than Green Day. Biilie Joe sang in somewhat of a British accent and played with a new found enthusiasm, not common with the grunge crowd. He was having fun, and on this record it leaks through into all the songs. And besides, who else would have named an albulm Dookie, and not have a sense of humor about the whole process. It was the perfect middle finger to all the grunge heads and wannabes who loved themselves way too much. The first pop-punk record that mattered, and in my opinion the only one you really need.
B000066NW0|5.0|ok.....i have just listened the let go album.......and i think its pretty good for her first try!!!.....i can hear some cool influences like alanis morrissete.....i would prefered that avril use a more Punk sound.....because let go its kinda Pop-Rock with some sparks of Punk....you know...you see this cute girl with her punk attitude singing songs like I'm With you...it's kinda strange....(by the way, great song!!)<BR>in general i think Let Go is a great cd from an excelent upcoming star....
B00000JCOV|4.0|This album is much differen't from their newest one, Iowa. It's not nearly as heavy, however it's way faster and uses a lot more DJing, percussion instruments, etc; in other words, it leans much more to the nu-metal side. In my opinion, it would be a tie between the two albums for me. Anyway, if you can handle intense music like this backed up by some very negative lyrics, then your probably going to love this album. Just be prepared for some occasional headaches :).
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger was an interesting book that addressed many ethical and human issues regardless of it's brief nature.  Meursault, he main character is attacked by the very society that created him.    He's a man accused of reacting and not reacting.   As a reader, you have a strong emotional understanding or a man who reacts to the world without  a &quot;normal&quot; emotional response.     Overall, I recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a book that confronts human nature from many angles.

B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson has made the perfect rock album!! Although full of controversy, I havn't heard of a rock fan who didn't love this album. It is one of my all times fvorites. The great thing about Manson is that you don't have to be a \\"Goth\\" to listen to him. Unlike NIN (Check out Pretty Hate Machine for another great album) I don't have to be feeling down to listen to this album, rather I find I can listen to it no matter what mood I'm in. The only song on this CD that isn't that great is Fundamentally Loathsome. But Coma White, Dope Show, Rock is Dead, I Don't Like  the Drugs, Mechanical Animals and Great Big White World more than make up for it. Honestly people BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005JRNN|5.0|When I got this it said European edition on it so I don't know if this was marketed everywhere or not.  Any way I absolutely love this album it is my favorite of hers yet!!!!

0385503954|5.0|After finishing this wonderful novel, the first of McEwan's I have read, I came on line to read some reviews. Those that hated the book genuinely puzzled me. I found it absolutely enthralling.<br />McEwan evokes such an immediate sense of time and place despite switching locales and timelines, that the reader is drawn in further and further. The book soars on several levels: the tale of the crime and its repercussions, the Writer-as-God aspect that ultimately envelopes the entire narrative, to name but two. In addition, there is the wonderful use of information NOT  revealed, be it secondary characters such as Lola and Marshall into who's heads we barely get a glimpse. <br />This book is a wonderful read. With subtle similarities to The English Patient amongst others, it is the most thought provoking character study told from multiple points of view I have read since The Poisonwood Bible. Highly recommended!!<br />I, too, plan on exploring all of Mr. McEwan's work.
6305971099|3.0|The movie itself consists of a down right pathetic and annoying storyline line where little Jamie (Harris) has a telepathic connection with (her uncle) Michael Myers. Poor set pieces also create a problem as they seen fake and completly spoil the atmosphere.<br />The continuity in micheal's mask is terrible also, but there are a few good points such as Alan Howarth's mix of Carpentar's original score and few sub- plots dotted here and there.<br />Overall a unscary and boring attempt at trying to make another \\"Halloween\\" movie.

B00005JLSC|4.0|Bob Fosse was such a larger-than-life talent, and this exuberant adaptation of his Seventies stage production shows it. The story of two murdering femme fatales (Renne Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both belting out songs and dancing their hearts out) in Prohibition-era Chicago is cynical, jaded, beyond belief--and just right as a vehicle to showcase the stars' considerable talents in an area where we did not expect to see them.<br />Picture Richard Gere, a hotshot lawyer who represents both ladies, singing and dancing while keeping his cynical persona intact, and you have an idea of just what a romp this movie really is. Catherine Zeta-Jones, showstopping gorgeous as a Theda Bera-style vamp, is nothing less than wonderful. So is Queen Latifah, who steals the show as the bribe-taking, seen-it-all matron of the women's prison. I'd see the movie all over again just to see the Queen give it all she's got in full twenties regalia--including a feather boa.<br />It's Renee Zellweger, in my opinion, who ultimately makes the movie, even though the entire ensemble cast is fabulous, right down to the bit players. She does a bravura job as Roxie, the sweet little murderess who, after plugging her no-good lover with a chest full of bullets shot at point-blank range, manages to convey a frightened innocence that makes one want to hug her. Slimmed down entirely from her zaftig \\"Bridget Jones\\" days, Renee gives it all she's got, and shows that she coulda been a contender--a torch singer par excellence.<br />Wild, big, bold, with 20s-style sets and 21st-century over-the-top editing, \\"Chicago\\" is a wonderful treat, well worth seeing more than once.
B00000JNNY|5.0|I haven't bought this CD yet, but I plan to. Just wanted to say to all you &quot;At Last&quot; fans that the Temptations do a rendition of it that's a real knock-out, too, on their &quot;For Lovers Only&quot; CD. Heard it over the holidays on a nightclub jukebox and had to do some real exploring to find out what it was. No one around me had ever heard the song nor knew anything about it. I'd remember hearing it in the unknown distant past, and it had obviously left a *wonderful* impression. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the Temptations doing it.<br />Just tonight I heard of Etta's rendition. I wonder who else does it! This is fun.
0792163710|5.0|Great treatment of a great movie. As mentioned below one small line was left out for reasons i cant imagine but in fact i would not have noticed if i hadnt read his review.

0671027344|5.0|This book was awesome. I started reading it and didn't put it down until I finished it. It is so sad and heartbreaking. It's about a teenage nobody who suddenly makes friends with popular kids. They begin to trust him with all their secrets because he's so quiet and \\"safe\\". He becomes exposed to parts of their lives they would hide from everyone else. He experiences love and loss, and discovers some secrets about himself and his family that he never knew about before. A great book about personal revalation and growth. It's a very easy read and written in a uinque style....letters to a person the main character doesn't know. All in all, a great book.
B00000099Y|5.0|In my opinion, this CD is one of the greatest ever.... The songs are long....but they're all great. This CD also opened the door for me to discover the pure genious of the Late Bill Hicks (He's the guy talking at the first of &quot;Third Eye&quot;). Buy it!
B00005JL95|5.0|I had watched many Disney movies before (a very, VERY long time ago). And I thought I'd see Hey Arnold (in theatres), and and didn't exactly like it. Then I wanted to see Lilo & Stitch, and once I did, \\"HA HA HA!!!!!\\" The best movie I have ever seen. The voice and SFX are extremely authentic, and has a perfectly efficient running time. I have had it for about 3 weeks, and I've watched it at least 15 times. I'm also surprised the CC system has the Hawaiian songs well written down. I have the CC on almost every time, and know almost every word in the movie. Closed Captioning is useful though, and is a good way to learn the movie's words and the songs. Anyway, I love the movie and I recommend seeing this movie (that is, if you have never seen it or had a good look of it.)
0783226063|3.0|This is a pretty good movie, aside from the fact that it has very little to do with the actual novel. The idea of a an auditory weapon to be used by an army, while creative, is nowhere to be found in the novel. There are many inconsistencies if you compare the two. However, if you look at the movie on its own as its own entity, it is quite good. I recomend it to anyone that isn't picky about movies sticking to the book or people that haven't read Dune.
0380002930|5.0|This book was one of the best reads I have ever experienced. The world created by the author, and the characters that are placed in that world are timeless. It reads the same today as it did in the early 70's. Time does not destroy this story in any way. The lavish world created and the expereinces of the rabbits is excellent. Before I read this book, I thought the book was geared towards being more of a childrens book, but found that it really wasn't. Any person of any age should enjoy the struggles of life as a rabbit. The story is so well told, and the details were elaborate so that i could visualize the world in my head so easily. If you are thinking of buying this book, then I suggest you do because you will not be disappointed. It is a fabulous work of art in my opinion.
B00005JKZ2|4.0|The only reason I even rented this movie in the first place is becuase Lara Flynn Boyle is in it. She does an excellent job as the villianess, Serleena, seeing that her script [was poor] There were some funny parts, and Frank was great. I loved the worms too. This movie was okay, but I only liked it because Lara was in it!
630025111X|5.0|This has been my favorite movie for years. So of course when I heard they were going to do a remake I had to watch. Lee Marvin got my vote for the better. There was just no comparison. And I'm a Tom Selleck fan. The whole movie with Marvin was just more realistic, from their dress to the buildings, their saddles and don't forget the music. Mama Cass's song couldn't have been more fitting. It left me thinking about the characters and their life, the new one didn't so much. Even the feelings between Marteen and Monte were done better in Lee Marvin's movie. So if you want a good western, true to the times, this is it.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Resident Evil is pap, stupid, predictable, violent, idiotic mayhem ... and I loved every minute of it.<br />I bought this DVD on a whim, and next to \\"We Were Soldiers\\" it was my favorite film of 2002. I laughed, shouted out advice or predictions, had a few suprises, and am maybe in love with Mila Jovovich. She looks simply fantastic, all wetted down in that little dress with her leather boots and kicking zombie butt.<br />2002 had two revivals of creature feature mayhem at it's best; \\"Eight Legged Freaks\\" with it's Giant Mutant Spiders On The Loose theme and the adorable Scarlet Johanson, and \\"Resident Evil\\" resurrecting the Zombie Movie for the Internet generation. Every possible Zombie Movie convention or style is shamelessly ripped off or recycled, with doses of \\"Aliens\\", \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" and even \\"The Matrix\\" thrown in for good measure. The film even boasts repeated, close-up views of Digital Readouts [of varying colors] ticking down until the film's implied doomsday. I am a connesiour [sp?] of Digital Readout movies, and \\"Resident Evil\\" has the best Digital Readouts I have seen since \\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\". If you want to watch a movie where you are constantly reminded of how long the plot has until doomsday, this is the movie for you.<br />It is also a movie that helpfully reminds its viewers of exactly what is going on every ten minutes or so by having a character list the plot details up to that point. This is done for the benefit of viewers who may have calculated that a run for the restroom is about due during the theatrical runs, and helps jar the memory of those who may not have been paying attention to every minute of the DVD. I found that helpful, because the people I watched it with and I were constantly discussing what was going on to the point where we were talking about the movie more than watching it. \\"Resident Evil\\" is an interactive film, and requires a sense of humor in addition to a strong stomach.<br />I am sorry that I missed seeing this movie in a theater; two of my fondest cinema visits were the aforementioned \\"Eight Legged Freaks\\", where each and every one of the audience members were interacting with each other and the movie. And \\"Starship Troopers\\", which I saw in NYC with an audience that, like me, were besides themselves with hilarity during the entire running length. \\"Resident Evil\\" is very much a film in the same genre, and as such delivered the goods, and is certainly due for some sort of \\"cult\\" status as time goes on. It is truly Something Awful.<br />But you know what? I'd rather have fun watching a movie than be subjected to an additional three hour purgatory like the two films that will probably contend for Best Movie this year [Peter Jackson's seriously bloated \\"The Two Towers\\" and Martin Scorcese's overtly ponderous \\"Gangs of New York\\"].

0060920084|3.0|Bill Bryson, living as an expatriate in London, returns to his roots in Des Moines and, borrowing his mother's Chevette, travels through 14,000 miles and thirty-eight states and looks at America.  He did not really like what he saw in this often-entertaining and sometimes-annoying book.<br />The Chevette was a pretty dreadful little car and perhaps it is not surprising that Bill Bryson seems to have travelled with his sarcasm gauge on full all the time.  \\"The Lost Continent\\" is sub-titled \\"Travels in Small-Town America\\" but it should be \\"Travels Through Small-Town America\\" as the author does not get out of his car very much.  He is on a Road Trip, which means driving endless numbing miles and meeting only those people essential to the Road Trip concept: waitresses, clerks in cheap motels and gas station attendants.  He is looking for the one Perfect American Town, blended of all those virtues he imagines small towns in the United States enjoy and which he calls Amalgam.<br />When he writes about his family and experiences growing up, Bill Bryson is very funny.  There are parts of the book where you have to laugh out loud-the account of eating at the restaurant in Pennsylvania Dutch country where \\"I ate so much my armpits bulged\\"-and other parts that are less successful.  Bill Bryson has an eye for funny detail but at the same time the reader has a feeling that he is patronizing of people who have not travelled, are poorly-educated or pronounce \\"Mississippi\\" the way people in Mississippi do.  He badgers someone about why \\"Cairo\\" in Illinois is pronounced \\"Kay-ro,\\" a question that probably nobody could answer and could be just as suitably asked of him and Des Moines.<br />There are unattractive aspects of life in America, including gun-related violence, an apparently low level of general knowledge, a grim history of racism and a national spiral into obesity but the people populating this book are only there to reinforce Bill Bryson's prejudices about the crumminess of his home country.  But it would have been nice to see his wit directed at television producers, evangelists and politicians and for him to have stayed longer in a town that just required to fill up the tank or sleep for a night.  Cooperstown, for example, was a town he liked for the Baseball Hall of Fame, but he does not mention the scholarship program available for all the high-school graduates there or how the town has successfully kept out the chain hotels and fast food places that so blight America everywhere else.  \\"Welcome to Des Moines.

0151006903|3.0|\\"Baudolino,\\" the fourth novel of semiotician and essayist Umberto Eco, is a supremely literate, if not literary, riff on the origins of modernity, told somewhat in the style of the author's popular \\"The Name of the Rose.\\" In the marshland between Milan and Genoa, Baudolino, a peasant boy with an ear for languages, is fortuitously discovered and befriended by Frederick Barbarossa, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and king of Germany and Italy. Frederick, a rapacious sort wedded to conquest and the feudal order, takes Baudolino into his confidence and becomes his adoptive father.<br />Over the course of the next 50 years and 450 pages, Baudolino experiences, and often singlehandedly invents, the picaresque before Marco Polo, diplomacy before Macchiavelli, poetry before Petrarch and Dante, Parisian student life, romantic love, pity, religious tolerance, the imagination of the story teller, the detective story, and the Oedipus complex, to name a few. He witnesses the growth and destruction of cities (including the author's native Alessandria), partakes of mysterious Moorish hallucinogens, tags along with the Crusaders, buys, sells, and harbors fake relics like so many junk bonds, and debates the good life and neoplatonism with dorm mates and mythological creatures alike.<br />Eco, for whom symbols are the ultimate reality, is fascinated by the 12th century's preoccupation with fabricated letters attributed to Prester John, a wholly imagined Christian king of the mysterious Far East. History tells us that Pope Alexander III sent his secretary in search of Prester John. The secretary was never heard of again. In Eco's novel, the letters have their genesis with Baudolino, who drafts the first of them to buttress a diplomatic maneuver of Frederick. After the mysterious death of Frederick, Baudolino, his friends, and an enemy in captivity set out without a map but with a fake Holy Grail in search of Prester John. They manage to cross the fabled river of rocks that divides Prester John's kingdom from the West and, several years later, to return. By novel's end this figment of Baudolino's imagination has morphed into a consuming obsession.<br />Eco is always heady and often witty, but his narrative, which tells the story of Baudolino's life virtually from cradle to grave, is monotonously straight-ahead.

B0000797IO|3.0|The Story:   Justine, the protagonist of this film is fed-up with her life. She shows this with her drooping shoulders, drony voice, and the way she leans against her counter at the Retail Rodeo, head in hand.  Her eyes sweep over the place constantly and disgustedly, she sighs to herself.  In one of those sweeps she takes in the mysterious new employee, Holden, whom no one knows much about as he keeps himself to himself.  He always has his head in a book which, when prompted by curiosity to introduce herself, Justine discovers is \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".  She also discovers that Holden is named for the hero of the book (and no his names not Catcher.)<br />Justine is drawn to Holden.  His quiet demeanor hides an inner struggle with his lot in life.  Although younger, Holden \\"gets\\" her.  She, entranced by his big soulful eyes and her desperation to make something beautiful to contrast her drab life, begins a romantic affair with this sensitive young man.  Theres only one problem, Justine is married.<br />Phil, her husband, a housepainter who spends most of his time smoking pot on the couch with his ever-present friend Bubba, is completely oblivious to his cuckold status.  In fact, he seems to think that everything is wonderful and that they are trying for a baby.  He believes that Justine is infertile, but is alarmed to discover that smoking doobies kills sperm.  He may be the infertile one.<br />Meanwhile, Justines relationship with Holden continues to blossom.  They eat lunch together everyday and make mooney eyes at one another from their respective corners of the Retail Rodeo.  They meet at an out of the way motel (under the disapproving eye of the desk clerk). It is after one of these trysts that Justine discovers the truck of Bubba, Phils ubiquitous friend, parked out front. Thats when everything starts to unravel for her--tragically.<br />My Thoughts:   Though laced with moments of humor, this movie is sad.  Jennifer Anniston, in the main role of Justine, is very good.  She is extremely believable as a world-weary and dissatisfied woman who needs a change so desperately that she enters into a serious relationship with a disturbed, immature young man (convincingly played by Jake Gyllenhaal.)   I could relate to her frustration with the empty sameness of day-to-day living.  Life in the small Texas town where she lives is predictable and stifling.  <br />I liked the desperation of Justine and Holdens relationship.  I believed that two people in their situation would try to fan the flames of passion in order to infuse their lives with some sort of meaning. I also liked the depressed looking employees of Retail Rodeo especially the announcement/free makeover girl who insults customers subliminally.  <br />\\"The Good Girl\\" is about a woman who tries to find meaning in her life through the idea of love, but finds tragedy instead.  Its a complex, thought-provoking film certainly worth the investment of watching.
038533348X|5.0|As a high school reader I missed the Vonnegut craze.  But, on one Saturday with nothing to do my father suggested that I read this.  I can say that a few hours later it is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read.  It my not be the best structured book, but I really enjoyed it thoroughly.  It is written so the main character, Jonah, has already gone through this.  This makes it helpful to the reader to explain some of the plot before you get there.  Anyway, Jonah is writing a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on a Japan.  As we go though his research he see Vonnegut insights into the institutions like science, religion, and many others. This is a book that really is going to make you think about ideals that you hold deal.  I can't wait to read other books by Vonngut.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Firstly, this is definitley a guy's movie but everyone loves fantasy so the girls will love it too. I think making a great movie  work is all about casting and the casting directors definitley earned their money on this one. Sean Bing did such a great job in the first film and Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill were awesome in this film. However, I am still hoping to see Shelob in the beginning of the next film but on the other hand I hope they don't make it look too cheasy. Did anyone notice the same  kid who played the hobbit also played a human child in the new movie. It must be Peter Jackson's kid. I'm also getting a little freaked out by the fact that everyone in this film series has blue eyes.
6304080921|4.0|Not knowing anything whatsoever about the plot of 12 Monkeys when I first sat down to watch it, I was at first disheartened by what seemed like a typical pulp fiction take on a familiar story.  The basic premise has Willis as survivor of a deadly infection that has killed 99% of the world's population, and who is sent back to the 90's to try and discover where the virus originated so that scientists in the future can discover a cure.  However, things start going wrong when he's sent back to 1990 rather than 1996 and finds himself locked up in a mental institution with stark-raving mad Brad Pitt as company and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe as company.  Believing that the virus is somehow connected to an underground ring calling themselves the army of the 12 Monkeys, Willis enlists Stowe to help him save the human race.<br />As potentially hokey and clichéd as the plot may at first sound, it is a great credit to director Gillam that he manages to pull it off with such panache.  The apocalyptic bleakness of not only the future but the faded, bright and harsh present is brilliantly realised and visually this is a very impressive movie indeed.  Also impressive is that Gillam actually confronts the impracticalities of time travel, such as asking how can you change the past if it's already happened?  Along with this there is the recurrent theme of fate and destiny as Willis constantly flashes back to nightmarish images of his childhood where he saw a man being shot at an airport, a dream that only becomes clear to him (and to us) at the very end.<br />Nods should also go to the performances of the film.  Willis again is nothing remarkable but this kind of movie is what he knows best, although given his subtler performance in The Sixth Sense some viewers may question why he doesn't take on more varied roles.  However, in fairness, 12 Monkeys cannot be seen as a conventional genre piece and in the same way Willis' character cannot be seen as conventional either.  Brad Pittputs in yet another tour de force of a performance as a mental patient, again proving what a capable actor he is with a great deal of versatility (compare his role here to his roles in Interview With The Vampire, Fight Club and Snatch) that deservedly bagged him an Oscar nomination.  Stowe is also incredibly charismatic, giving a performance that refuses to pigeon-hole her as just an obligatory love interest.<br />12 Monkeys works simply because it often weaves genres together, pumping new life into the apocalypse drama and the time travel story whilst still telling a pretty touching love story with a tragic ending.  Equal parts violent and passionate as it is bleak and ultimately depressing, it is small wonder that 12 Monkeys became an almost cult classic of its era.  It may not be a revelation but it's certainly different and unforgettable.
B000005DQR|5.0|A truly immortal album in abstract hip-hop/electronic/turntablism/etc.!  I find it absolutely amazing that Shadow is able to make absolutely wonderful, complexly layered compositions using nothing but his turntables, a sampler, and most importantly, his vinyl collection, using some extremely obscure samples from it from extremely obscure records (much like Jack Danger's (Meat Beat Manifesto, Tino) vinyl collection), and making all of them fit together seamlessly, harmoniously, and beautifully.  Some of his tracks sound very cinematic, IMHO (i.e. Building Steam, Changeling, Midnight, Napalm Brain) as if they were from a lost soundtrack, and some are rather gorgeous to listen to.    Overall, a classic album, which has, and further will, age very well...

Following in the footsteps of Toy Story and A Bug's Life, it is a funny and touching story of a monster and the little girl who loves him.  John Goodman gives voice to the most lovable of all the monsters in Monstropolis.  Sulley is the top scarer at Monster's Inc. but someone else has found a new way to beat that record and pull in ratings topping numbers.  Randall, voiced by Steve Buscemi, is just the type of monster that makes kids afriad to open their closet.  He is a self serving, chamaleon like monster who has come up with a scheme that will take the world of scaring to a whole new level.  Instead of the old system of hiding in the closet and scaring a kid to get a litlte scream, why not just milk it out of them with a machine?  Randall accidentally lets a little girl (Boo) lose in Monstropolis.  Sulley thinks its his fault, so he takes it upon himself to put her back with the help of his pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).  On the way, they have fun adventures and lots of fun comedy.  Sulley discovers what Randall is up to and that Boo is at the center of it.  Will he be able to stop it in time?
B00005JKO3|5.0|One of my all time favorites. No sex, bad language, or computer special effects, which alone make it a must see. Outstanding acting and music. To bad it's only available on very poor quality video.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Based on the video game of the same name.  Resident Evil stars Mila Jovavich as Alice, a member of a group that is supposed to protect the Hive.  The Hive is an underground facility owned by Umbrella Corp., an orginazation that specializes in bio-chemical products.  Little does anyone know, but someone has tried to steal a secret formula that bring on the end of the world as we know it.  In doing so, they have set loose a chemical that keeps the dead alive and truns them in monsters who only crave one thing, human flesh.  Alice and her group must infiltrate the hive, and find the red queen, a computer that controls everything in the hive, and find out what caused her to go crazy and kill everyone.  In doing so, they endanger their own lives because they must let loose all of the flesh eating zombies to get the hard drive that holds the red queen.  Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, and Martin Crewes.  They must all work together if any of them wants to get out of the hive alive.  One of the best video game to movie adaptations I have ever seen.
B00005R87Q|2.0|In The Fast and the Furious, Paul Walker stars as an undercover cop who's seduced by the underground world of drag racing.  Vin Diesel is the head of one particular gang that get their kicks from stealing DVD players off trucks, preferring to do so while the truck is moving at high speeds, perhaps for the sheer thrill of it (and spending countless money on NOS, no less).  That's just one of the movie's many idiocies, which would be forgivable if the movie was consistently entertaining.  It's not.<br />What's most surprising about the film is its lack of action.  Aside from a couple of chase scenes near the end (more on those later), we mostly see Walker getting accustomed to this illegal lifestyle.  In the hands of a first-rate actor, this might be compelling.  In Walker's hands, it's flat-out dull.  He's the movie's protagonist, and he's as boring as they come (to be fair, though, Walker did improve his acting skills in Joy Ride).  He's not the only poor performer here.  Even worse than him are the likes of Matt Schulze and Michelle Rodriguez, both of whom look like they'd be more comfortable posing for a magazine than enunciating dialogue.  <br />Faring much better than the rest of the cast is Vin Diesel, whose deep, hypnotic voice is enough to compel alone.  Otherwise, he's at least a decent actor, capable of displaying a wider range of emotions than anyone else here, though he's certainly not aided by the giggle-inducing dialogue (&quot;You break her heart, I break your neck&quot;).  Playing his sister is Jordana Brewster, a real cutie whose only purpose is to play Walker's love interest and be the instigator for his &quot;internal conflict.&quot;  The role might have been more interesting with some nudity, but alas, it was not to happen.<br />The story can be summed up as Point Break with cars, which might sound cool, but then again, I didn't much care for Point Break in the first place.  So I suppose what matters here is the action, and for whatever lack of itwe get in quantity, at least the quality is above average.  There's a thrilling sequence that will remind a lot of viewers of the climax of The Road Warrior, if nowhere near as exhilarating.  The stunts are impressive, but hardly anything we wouldn't otherwise see in any dozen summer blockbusters.  So while the finale is reasonably fun, it's too little too late by then.  For truly thrilling, mindlessly enjoyable car chase mayhem, watch The Road Warrior or (for more recent-minded viewers) The Transporter instead.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|If you have ever seen Hugh Grant in a movie, you know that he always plays a cocky brit.  This movie is no different.  However, in this particular flick, he plays a very funnny and lovable cocky brit.  Hugh plays Will, a self indulgent man who has lived his entire life off of the royalties of a song his father wrote.  After being set up with a single mom by a friend of his, he decides that this is a section of the dating pool that he was unaware of.  He begins to go to SPAT meetings (Single Parent Alone Together) and lies to make them think he is sensitive.  On his first date with a SPAT mom, she brings along the little of boy of a fellow SPATer named Marcus.  After a day of fun in the park, Marcus begins to think that Will would be perfect for his mother, an emotionally disturbed woman who attempts to tkae her own life.  He sets in motion a plan to get Will to marry his mother.  Marcus begins to spend more time with Will and eventually gets throught to him and makes him realize that he needs more out of life then himself.  \\"As Jon Bon Jovi said, no man is an island\\".  This movie showwed that Hugh Grant is a fantastic actor capable of real human emotion.  I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I originally wanted to see this movie because of it's stellar cast.  Drew Barrymore, Jake Gyllenhaal, Noah Wylie, and Mary Mcdonnell are all exceptionally cast.  Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a tainted young man who hears voices and sleepwalks.  One night he is drawn from his bed onto a golf course.  While there he meets Frank, a 6 foot tall rabbit who tells him that the end of the world is coming.  Donnie narrowly escapes death as an airplane engine falls into his bedroom and lands on his bed where he should have been sleeping.  Upon finding out this information, Donnie begins to notice things that normal people don't see.  He starts to question life, and the theory of time travel.  It eventually becomes obvious to Donnie that he was not suppose to survive the night of the engine crash.  Now he must put all the pieces of the puzzle and figure out how to undo the damage before he loses all those closest to him.  Anyone with an interest in time travel or a love for dark films should see this.  A++ film.
051788710X|5.0|As a lifelong dreamer, I most appreciate Moss's approach to dreamwork, because he gives the power of understanding dreams and the dreamworld to the dreamer - where it belongs.  This book gives anyone who wants to understand herself, her dreams, and the world around her the keys to doing so.  In fact, one chapter of the book is called &quot;Nine Keys to Your Dreams&quot;, in which he succinctly lays out different ways to work with and understand your dreams.  He supports those techniques with numerous examples from the experiences of other dreamers as well as his own.<br />As a professional writer, weaver, and coach/teacher of creativity, I especially appreciated the last chapter, &quot;The Creative Power of Dreams&quot;, in which Moss discusses the power of creative dream incubation, how to write from dreams, and how to use your dreams to get advice and information on creative projects.  I always recommend it to my students.<br />This book is a good choice for both the novice and the experienced practioner of dreamwork.  The writing is personal and accessible, and the stories of other dreamers are affirmations of the gifts that wait for us in the dream world.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Nicole Kidman and Ewen McGregor lead a cast of delightful actors in a movie that brings back the musical.  Kidman plays Satine, a Courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.  She is the Sparkling Diamond.  Her boss, Zidler, has plans to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater by using Satine to get the money out of a rich Duke.

0060278269|5.0|As in \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael,\\" Death is a riverine chasm from which the dead can be called back to the living by powerful necromancers.  Only the Abhorsen (Sabriel) or the Abhorsen-in-waiting (Lirael) can pass from life into the river of Death, through the eight Gates of fog, whirlpools, waterfalls, and shadow, and do magical combat with the necromancers in their own dark realm...<br />Well, the Disreputable Dog can splash into Death, too and in \\"Abhorsen\\" you'll find out who she really is, along with Mogget the bad-tempered cat (who reminds me of some of the grouchier Jack Lemon characters).<br />\\"Abhorsen\\" is a worthy conclusion to Nix's Old Kingdom trilogy.  Read \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" before undertaking \\"Abhorsen,\\" so that you can familiarize yourself with the Philosophy and Geography of Death.  Nix isn't into summarization or repetition. He plunges his reader right into a whirlpool of death, animated corpses, and Charter magic.  If you don't already know such characters as the Disreputable Dog, the necromancer Hedge, or his bone-headed companion, Nick, you might never figure out what's going on.<br />This book is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.  Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre.  The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.<br />The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.  It is an eerie experience to remember that journey of birth--only this time in the wake of the dead--in this marvelous fantasy trilogy.of our water-bound gestation.  It is an eerie experience to remember that journey of birth--only this time in the wake of the dead--in this marvelous fantasy trilogy.
B00006F83Y|5.0|'Songs fothe deaf is by far the album of 2002. The sheer scope and dept of the songs is staggering.QTOSA have simply corrolated a style that is all of their own without ever boxing them in to one style.The musicianship is staggering throughout. Dave Grohl has never drumed with such power or inventiveness. The production is also a marvel, bringing songs such as 'God is on the radio ' and 'The sky is falling' into breathtakingly cinematic waters.this album deservers to make superstars of Qotsa once and for all.Their previous album 'Rated R' was a major CD of 2000.This time round they have produced the classic of there career.Can't wait for the follow up
B00006RU5B|1.0|Despite the lowly one star I'm giving this album it was actually #1 in certain categories:<br />-most overhyped and desperately promoted as the next big thing for the year 2002 (duh, of course it was, it's a &quot;supergroup&quot;, silly)<br />-most dissapointing album of 2002<br />-top album of all time created by incredible musical talents who do their darnest best to totally underachieve and undermine everything they ever did previously in their careers<br />  These, are to name but a few of the categories that this album DOES top. Sadly all these categories tend on the negative side..<br />  But more specifically then: i was (and am) both a fan of RATM and Soundgarden. That of course is the equivalent of liking things so extremely different as liking apple pie and snowboarding. These two groups do lie under the rubric of rock, yes, but other than that they existed and functioned on different galaxies.<br />  But on comes this &quot;supergroup-project&quot; and you are forced to think about it. Worst of all you are forced to listen to the CD but I'll get to that.<br />  So here are some thoughts:<br />Possibly the most important political band of all time (RATM) is reduced to this?????? Why does a singer like Cornell (who, dont get me wrong, is otherwise a stunning vocalist) insert himself in a scheme where he fits as much as a bag of salt fits on chocolate ice-cream? Why would a terrifically innovative musician like Morello play dishwashed tunes like this that shove us in a time machine and take us to musical places we have already been 20 years ago????<br />  And it gets worse. Why call this Audioslave and not Soundgardenslave? At least then a level of honesty would've been achieved and people wouldnt expect too much. That is not to say that Soundgarden were a bad group, quite the contrary, but, like i sad above, this is so, so, so, incompatible it sets a new definition.<br />  And somehow it gets worse yet. If you liked Soundgarden (like i did, and still do) then why opt for Audioslave? I mean, this is an incredible lose-lose scenario, folks. If you are, say, a Soundgarden fan what you get in this is one of the most watered down efforts Cornell has done. In fact it will be hard for him to outdo the predicament he manages here. Then, similarly, if you are a RATM fan (like i was and still am) why, again, opt, for Audioslave??? Where is the hardpunching political edge and crunching threatening riffs? Where is the raw energy? Where is the fire? In fact where is Morello? Because, if you dont double-check inside the booklet you will find it hard to believe that Morello is playing in such a spectacularly retrogressive album.<br />  And it gets, somehow, even worse. What i find to be the lowest point of this band is their motivation. What motivation, you ask? Exactly. What is the point of all this??? I trully dont get it. Having followed for years the history of Morello and co. i want to refuse to believe that this was done for the money factor. Might've been for Cornell who anyway has clearly stated that he finds politics boring (well, maybe naivity has always been a big part of rock and most of us are in denial about it, thus we overjudge such statements). Then, I'm thinking, hey man, maybe these 4 people were just opting for trying something different. Ok. Fair enough. It can be boring -and i seriously mean that- to be constantly the hardcore musical/political vanguard of a generation. It can also be tiring on your soul, it can be a burden you want a break from. But hopefully it will somehow dawn on them that &quot;different&quot; isn't always good.<br />  Some people said Cornell doesnt fit in cuzz he doesn't rap. That's a silly argument and it's not even the point. I dont think Audioslave would've sounded automatically better had they hired a rapper. I just think the remains of RATM simply created something alltogether different. And it failed.<br />  I'm even going to be kind, and tell you that you should actually listen to this CD. Of course you should. Otherwise, how are you ever going to  find out how a dishwasher works?
B00005JKES|5.0|I don't understand why people complain about the series not including the pilot.  They don't hold the rights to it, therefore they can't include it in the set.  You can purchase it seperately from here on Amazon[.com] or off Ebay.<br />This is a GREAT series!  I can't wait for season 2 to come out!  As a fan of Lynch, and a new fan of the TP series, I love this.  I really wish I had watched it when it originally aired.  Now I'm torn between reading what happens in the second season, or waiting for it to come out on dvd.  I waited a while to pick this boxset up because I was afraid it might not be worth the money for me, being a \\"blind\\" purchase and all.  But boy was I wrong!  This is a great collection that I would suggest any fan of Lynch pick up, or any person who liked the Fire Walk with Me movie.

B00005ATQF|5.0|Stanley Kubrick has been quoted as saying that with Full Metal Jacket, he wanted to make a war film, as opposed to an ANTI-war film. Condemning war is easily. It's a moral no-brainer.  Trying to understand its nature is something far more challenging.  As a result, Full Metal Jacket does something far more subtle and difficult than simply tell us that War is Hell (although it does that, too).  To understand what and how, one must consider the film's structure:<br />Full Metal Jacket is split brutally into two parts, the first of which follows our hero, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) through basic training at Parris Island. A tubby, slow-witted misfit named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio in an effective performance) is pushed too hard by the sadistic drill instructor Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey), and ends up killing both Hartman and  himself in the Grand Guignol blackout sketch that ends part one.<br />It is at this point that many people have trouble with Full Metal Jacket, as the second half jumps to Viet Nam with no warning. Although Joker and another character named Cowboy (Arliss Howard) carry over from the first part of the film, they never so much as talk about Parris Island or the murder-suicide that marked their training there. It is as though that event happened in another universe, or at least a different movie.<br />The key to this apparent gaffe in story cohesion is contained in a scene where Joker is confronted by a Major over having \\"Born to Kill\\" scrawled on his helmet at the same time he wears a peace symbol on his flak jacket.<br />\\"I was trying to say something about the duality of man,\\" he says, \\"...the Jungian thing, SIR!\\"<br />Duality of man; duality of film. There are (in the film's  developing thesis) two possible motivations for killing people and breaking things - compassion (to defend freedom and turn back despotism; our OFFICIAL purpose in Viet Nam), and annihilation (the perverse joy of revenge, of domination; of blood-soaked victory).<br />Which motivation is more \\"moral\\"? Which leads to the \\"high-ground\\"? Doesn't annihilation always entail moral decay? And doesn't compassion always lead, ultimately, to peace, rather than violence? Through Joker's journey, from killer-in-training to killer-in-fact, we get a disturbing answer that, by its very simplicity, defies the kind of dumbed-down platitudes most war films (even really good ones like Kubrick's own Paths of Glory) try to feed us. The end finds Joker facing a wounded, disarmed sniper who has killed several of his fellow soldiers, as well as his best friend. In a typically Kubrickian reversal, the sadistic thing would be to \\"...leave her to the mother-lovin' rats...\\" (in other words, leave her in PEACE), rather than finish her off, which seems the more humane choice (through a paradoxical act of VIOLENCE). The sniper, a teenaged girl, even begs Joker to shoot her. It seems a simple, humanitarian act when he finally pulls the trigger, but in a long, ambiguous close-up on his face, we see the same demon lurking in Joker's eyes that haunted Lawrence back in Parris Island, just before he killed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, then himself. The connection is clear; even the same music cue (by Kubrick's daughter Vivian, under the pseudonym of \\"Abigail Mead\\") can be heard on the sound track. By setting up a situation where both possible choices (to kill or not to kill) seem at once sadistic and kind, virtuous and evil, we are forced to see the situation on a more abstract level - where words fail, but a horrible insight reveals itself. The nature of war, it seems to suggest, is the nature of mankind - and vice-versa.<br />Kubrick's production values are first-rate. The DVD looks and sounds quite good, given the source material (Kubrick's muted palette is deliberate; his original sound mix was a fairly compressed monaural track). One particular use of a Steadicam with a slightly longer-than-ideal lens is inspired, giving us a view shaky enough to seem \\"real\\" but smooth enough to be fluid.<br />In the Kubrick canon, Full Metal Jacket is a hotly debated film.  Whether you love it or hate it, just remember: it's a Jungian thing.ut smooth enough to be fluid.<br />In the Kubrick canon, Full Metal Jacket is a hotly debated film.  Whether you love it or hate it, just remember: it's a Jungian thing.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album epitomizes what rock music can be -- art that is also fun. After giving up the fast-paced life of moptop popstars, touring, and all that goes with that whirlwind lifestyle, the band concentrated their efforts fully on the creation of this great album. The production is stellar, and when you realize that this was crafted by four guys in their mid-20's (and a producer who wasn't much older) utilizing 4-track technology, it is truly mindblowing.<BR>Of course, this album is heavily colored by its time: the Summer of Love, hippies, swinging London, soft drugs, Haight-Ashbury, and war protests. It is particularly colored by a very English hall sense of tradition, mixed with cutting edge rock innovations, sprinkled over with hints of near eastern mystism and psychedelic imagery. The polite Anglo expressions and nuances of Lovely Rita, With A Little Help from My Friends, Good Morning Good Morning, and Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite make this a thoroughly English experience. The Beatles, along with James Bond, made England seem like the coolest place on the planet in the 60's.<BR>Over time, its still the production and recording advances and experimentation that make this so interesting, maybe even moreso than the songs themselves. Of course, there is no doubt the songs are great, but listen to the ALBUM, not just the songs. When you do, you hear great little things like Paul using timpani mallets to strike the wires inside the piano to make the notes, rather than playing the keyboard, at the end of Getting Better; the snatches of carnival sounds cut up and reassembled into a collage of sound that creates the canvas against which Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite builds; the echo-y \\"live\\" feel of the Sgt. Pepper's tracks; and the grand orgy of chaos on A Day In the Life. Listen close during that endless last chord and you can hear someone fidgeting in a squeaky chair.<BR>Brilliant album. The songs may not be quite as strong as Revolver, but there is no denyingthe influence this album has had on rock music. 100 years from now they will still be pointing to this album as a turning point. Awesome.
B00006GEXR|3.0|I almost rated this movie prematurely. Half way through I was LOVING it because I thought I knew what was going to happen and this \\"presumed ending\\" was so non-traditional that I real expectations. (I know I know most would disagree with me)<br />The ending I had was Hugh  somehow getting together with Toni, a not beautiful woman, a woman with problems, a woman with eccentricities etc. but him looking beyond that.<br />But of course Hollywood cannot help itself and along comes the flawlessly beautiful Rachel W. Now if Hugh  would have picked TC OVER RW that would have been a real breath of fresh air. I thought the story sort of went down hill after Rachel hits the scene.<br />So the first half is 5 and the second half is 21/2 - 3.<br />Hugh Grant is PERFECT. I wish he made more funny movies. He can pull off such wit.<br />If you liked this movie I recommend Corrina, Corrina

B000002B49|5.0|'Music Detected' was my first CD by Deep Forest and, even though I loved it while most other DF fans were disappointed and some even appalled by their drastic change in sound, after listening to their highly praised 'Boheme' I now have a better understanding of why!<br />I still love 'Music Detected' and wouldn't dream of changing my rating, but after hearing 'Boheme' it simply blew me away and just might have affected the way I thought about MD if I had purchased this before that...<br />'Music Detected' has a more eclectic sound than 'Boheme' for (unlike this album) MD mixed an interesting, if not hypnotic fusion of world, rock, dance and soul with most of the songs sung in english, which must have taken a lot of die-hard Deep Forest fans for a loop because their initial style has a more ethnic-world sound with modern beats and ancient pygmy vocals that are rich (and yes, a little strange) but full of life and vigor!<br />Both are very good but to compare them is somewhat difficult for they're both so very different!<br />'Music Detected' will never dish up classic DF tracks like \\"Marta's Song\\" and \\"Boheme\\" but if you have an open-mind than DF fans will hopefully learn to grow with their expanding overflow of experimentations... I for one was completely enthralled with both albums and am deeply looking forward to checking out their other releases, which are probably just as amazing!<br />Aside from the god-awful \\"Bulgarian Melody\\" (which should have never been sung as a ballad), the rest of 'Boheme' is simply mind-boggling and all fans of world music should get themselves a copy...Pronto!
B000065JN7|4.0|This film is in a way a masterpiece that gives a vision of how young men influenced or organized by older men live in the margin of society, on the fringe of normalcy. They practice drugs as if it were some kind of hobby, not really to experience some drug-produced hallucinations but a drug-induced escape from real society, from fear, from hunger, from thirst, from their basic needs and impulses. Yet they reduce themselves to those very basic impulses and live an experience that has nothing else to propose, to offer but suffering from and amplifying those impulses. They find the morbid pleasure, at times deeply wrapped up in scatological regression, of experiencing these impulses without any limitations. This of course leads them to activities that have nothing to do with intelligence, the intellectual understanding of their alienations, but everything to do with considering society as a field  for their hunting, even scavenging. But what do they hunt ? Money, adventure, the power of doing what is forbidden, the thrill of getting into supposedly unexplored feelings and intense emotions. Their life becomes a jungle where emotions and feelings are driving forces and fascinating objectives. A baby dies because of the lack of care and love that is needed for it to survive or to live, but that death becomes the center of some « pleasure », the « pleasure » of suffering in the hands of death. One will thus die in this search by getting used to starving and finally passing away because this experiment has no other exit. One will be forced by his parents to go cold turkey and establish a distance between himself and that morbidity. Another will be sent to prison and forced to cut off from those extreme habits. And strangely enough it is those two who will manage to get some profit out of it, hence the means to cut off the umbilical cord that attaches them to this alienation. This epiphany will be reached through betrayal but it is seen by the two as some kind of a new beginning, as a door leading to another life, the life they have been longing for for so long, the life of normal people blending in the social mass around them, even if they have to escape to some other niche where their strange past can be unknown and forgotten. This is the dilemma of so many young people who want to experience adventure and a wilderness that does not exist naturally in our societies. They create with their own hands a wilderness in which they can experience the fear and dangers of a jungle that is more a creation of their own than real. And yet we have to come to the conclusion that our societies do enable such young people to find and build this jungle. Maybe this jungle is part of our societies, even if it is mostly invisible.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignaneginning, as a door leading to another life, the life they have been longing for for so long, the life of normal people blending in the social mass around them, even if they have to escape to some other niche where their strange past can be unknown and forgotten.

And he takes what he has to take, the whole loot of the last juicy operation, or nearly all, his passport that he had put away and off he goes leaving the craziest one put himself in prison and the other two go back on the road that leads to the blind alley of a sky-less life. If you can spot the train of liberation in that fable of alienation, tell me and don't forget to take it without asking anyone if you can. A masterpiece of the same type and power as Clockwork Orange I guess.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

0066214122|4.0|I enjoyed this novel from beginning to end.  Crichton's ability to merge nature and technology together was definitely the highlight of this book.  I enjoyed learning about the potential for nano-technology and the power of distributed computing.  From a technical standpoint this book was great.  However, the story took a long time to reach a climax (Which was very exciting) and I felt almost bored for the first few chapters.  I recommend this book to those of you who are interested in a twist on Artificial Intelligence and who have a healthy imagination.

B00005JKZT|5.0|When I love a film this much, it is difficult for me to write a review.  I'm afraid I'll lose my perspective and not be able to see the film for what it is.  So, I made sure that I saw \\"The Twin Towers\\" twice in theaters, and was lucky enough to live in a city where the second showing was the IMAX version.  As you can imagine, that was totally mind-blowing!<br /><br />A fan of Tolkien for the last 35 years, I was unafraid of the changes that director Peter Jackson would need to make to continue the story line without burdening it with too many characters.  Anxious to see how he handled the split of the fellowship and its parallel plots, I felt that this was one of the strongest elements of the film! Each of the three plots had a sense of urgency, clear transitions existed between them, and, although the support of the Rohan and the Battle for Helm's Deep far outweighed the progress of Frodo and the journey of Merry, Pippin and the Ents, Jackson kept us riveted in all three.  Many Tolkien loyalists have taken the changes, especially those involving Faramir, as a departure from what Tolkien originally intended.  In contrast, I believe that Jackson and the screenwriters did a masterful job of simplifying, maintaining the good vs. evil theme, and keeping the pace of the movie on target.  There are no plot changes that subtracted from the overall thrill of the film experience for me.<br /><br />There is no question that the cinematography, costumes, compelling and sweeping vistas of the vast plain of Middle Earth don't take a back seat to characterization and plot in the movie.  The overall visual experience is one of startled wonder, especially the capture of the gloom and fearfulness of Mordor and the evil that has overtaken Isengard.  The music is a perfect counterpoint to the visual senses.  Jackson allows his cast of strong players to once again assume their roles, but no one or group of characters, no plot line, no special effects outbalance the setting.  It feels as though we are again watching the same genius that compelled George Lucas, when he made his \\"middle\\" or \\"bridge\\" piece (The Empire Strikes Back) the best of his film trilogy so many years ago.  For me, the success of this film revolved around three startling elements:<br /><br />1. Gollum.  Gollum is a masterwork, in a film year that has seen some rapid developments and successes in computer aided special effects.  Gollum, in the work of Tolkien, is the central force, a character that embodies the elements of good and evil in his life and in his actions.  In the book, the dual characterization of Gollum (evil) vs. Smeagle (good) is difficult to follow, through their discourse.  When the visualization is added on film, with a masterful voice (and, I'm told, a huge contribution to the special effects through his own body language) by Andy Smerkis, the character of Gollum (as evil as we know him to be) and the misguided creature befriended by Frodo meld their elements successfully.  To say that Gollum is brought to life in a believable, charismatic way, is to understate how brilliantly the character worked on film.<br /><br />2. The Battle for Helm's Deep.  Never has a powerful and evil enemy come to life on the screen in the way that Jackson portray's Saruman's army.  The sense of doom that permeates the stronghold of Helm's Deep is felt throughout the audience.  The reliance of the world of men on the impermeability of the Helm's Deep fortress is put to the test, and Jackson gives us nearly an hour of incredibly intense battle, punctuated with views of the women and children trapped in the fortress.  Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas all play their roles perfectly in the height of battle, and the viewer is locked to the edge of their seats with every passing moment.<br /><br />3. For me, the signature moment of the film is the white light arrival of Gandalf on the magnificent steed Shadowfax.  With me, the theater audience cheered and clapped...the instant that he is seenby Aragorn, the surge of feeling and power felt on the screen in that second, will stay with me for a long time.<br /><br />I think there are no words left to say that won't duplicate what I've already said - 5 stars only because 6 were not available...The Two Towers is a work of breathtaking achievement!een by Aragorn, the surge of feeling and power felt on the screen in that second, will stay with me for a long time.<BR><BR><BR>I think there are no words left to say that won't duplicate what I've already said - 5 stars only because 6 were not available...The Two Towers is a work of breathtaking achievement!

B00006RIO7|4.0|The movie was fantastic, and the soundtrack brings back everything I loved about it.  I haven't listened to the tracks at the end much since I keep replaying the ones I liked from the movie.  One note of warning:  you might not want to play this around impressionable kids.  Mine are 5 and 6 and I'd forgotten how much adult language there was in the songs.  Unfortunately I played it once for them, and they're hooked on the songs.  I usually just talk loudly when I know a bad word's coming up.  :)
B0000057C5|4.0|This was Rammstein's breakthrough album, a very raw and powerfull type of metal.

B00005RJ1U|5.0|Jeepers Creepers was something fresh and different from the usual horror we've been watching over the years. For starters it is real creepy at times. The evil Creeper is unpredictable and unstoppable. This movie was a bit like The X-Files. No one knew the origin or true identity of the Creeper or what his motives were. The only thing you could be sure of is that he would get you...no matter what! The ending was good too. I won't spoil it but it was extremely creepy and will probably give you nightmares!
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is an excellent science fiction movie that serves as a 1990's equivalent of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Many questions concerning philosophy, theology and science could be addressed from those who see this movie.<br />From a philosophical perspective, one might argue that though the setting is in the future, the vision of the created society is quite ancient. In this movie only the most powerful leaders making the most influential decisions are the so-called \\"gifted\\", which is idealistically a mirror of Plato's Republic. So from a structured standpoint, Gattaca is the culmination of ideas or ideals established from the most highly esteemed of the ancient Greeks; however, it is also blended in with the modern day science of genetic engineering, where a perfect society must be run by perfect people, most of whom are products or byproducts of the scientific wonders of those who have determined what constitutes the attainment of human perfection.<br />Running counter to theme of Gattaca are those outcasts who are supposedly too genetically deficient for the main functioning of society but who nonetheless believe that they can transcend the imposed limitations and expectations (e.g. physical endurance, life expectancy, etc.) predetermined even before birth.<br />Two opposing themes are prevalent throughout. At one end of the spectrum, society has accepted that science is advanced enough to pinpoint the outcomes of one's destiny from birth to death as well as tell in advance what that person's particular strengths and weaknesses will be. On the other end, however, is one's attempts to show that the whole is more than the sum of its parts and that the efforts of constituting a perfect society are misconstrued for they are merely the result of adding those methodical bits and pieces.<br />Quite disturbing is the fact that there exist terminologies that bring about new discussion concerning this movie as well as the vision of a progressing, futuristic society. Among these are paradigm shifts, infrastructures and zones of proximity, each of which can be looked upon from so many different angles.<br />All in all, perhaps what is the main issue is determining just what human potential is and who the experts of this advancement are supposed to be. Added to this are concerns about the future and whether our leaders who will, by then, espouse bringing forth progress will by and large be compassionate philanthropists at best or sociopathic, cultic leaders at worst.
B00005RDAE|5.0|Britney is the best. Good video. IAS4U, DLMBTLTK, NAGNYAW music videos included. Also, crossroads movie trailers, photo shoots, pepsi commericial, and slave performance at VMAS (think snakes). Although it's not that long, it's great.
B000067J1Q|5.0|I love this movie. It recaptures what I love most about Europe and the old-fashioned way of life. The quality of audio and video in this widescreen DVD edition is also excellent and makes the viewer appreciate fully the sumptuous beauty of the scenery.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Shall we say a more happier well lets not say that a more mellon-collie Joy Division.Yes, while the New York Based Art rock band Interpol Borrows sounds from Post-Punk Pioneers Joy Division,The Fall,The Smiths and The Chameoleons somehow they have managed to develope there own sound,create there own Identity in the anals of rock history.While Interpol is busy building there own Sonic Cathedral in Hell alongside Goth rock pioneers Joy Division lets take a look similarities of the two.The Voice of Paul Banks the lead vocalist for Interpol Manages to conjure up the Ghost of late Joy Division Singer Ian Curtis(God Rest His Soul).Well lets just say this if Ian Curtis had been a happier man he would have sounded like Paul Banks.Yes,Artistic/Gothic People Interpol have manage to revive a once dead scene.Well this Album in my opinion is a true classic i didn't think that when i first bought it,I Remember hearing about Interpol Back in August from the Internet i did'nt think to much about them until I saw the Video for PDA,I was amased at how it looked and sounded so I went Out and bought the album.When I first Heard I thought it was okay but after listening to it for a while I got up and Said this was a Masterpiece,a true artistic gem.and since then It has been one of my favorite albums(and I own alot of Albums too).The Best songs on here in my opinion are \\"PDA\\" \\"Say hello to the angles\\" \\"Hands Away\\" \\"Obstacle2\\"\\"Stella was diver and she's always Down\\" and basically all of them are good.Yes,In Time my Generaration which is Generation Y will look at Interpol the same way Generation X looks at Joy Division and The Smiths.The Album \\"Turn on the bright lights\\" will Someday years from now will be viewed as a Classic and Possibly Ground-Breaking like the Joy Division's \\"Unkown Pleasures\\",and \\"Closer\\" maybe even the smiths \\"Meat Is Murder\\" or shall we even say The 1967 ahead of its Time Masterpiece\\"The Velvet Undergroun&Nico\\",Hell this album's already a classic.Well In Conclusion This DARK AVANT-GARDE TEENAGER from Oklahoma gives this an A+, A MELLON-COLLIE JOY DIVISION IN MY OPINION BUT MAN IT SURE SOUNDS GREAT!
B0000797IO|2.0|Jennifer Aniston, rapidly becoming one of America's darlings of the cinema, makes a great performance in a movie that simply doesn't add up to much.<br />She plays Justine, a girl who's life has become an unbearable trap, from a dead-end job at Retail Rodeo, and a marriage that is dysfunctional at best. Offering a ticket out of this despair is Holden, a young 22 year old confused stallion recently employed at the Retail Rodeo. Through an ill-thought out affair, Justine begins to experience a possible glimpse of the &quot;other side&quot;.<br />However, much of what happens in this movie is ill-thought out. Jennifer's dead-end marriage to wonderful character actor John C. Reilly is unexplained; there is no obvioius attraction between the two and much of the movie was spent wondering why they were together.  While it helps to propel the reason for the affair, it still doesn't help resolve issues at the end of the movie. The plot is ill-thought out, meandering through event after event, as we watch Justine react to one thing and another. A boring life doesn't not a good movie make.<br />While the &quot;Good Girl&quot; had some good intentions, the end result isn't very.
0385508417|2.0|I found this holiday novella by John Grisham to be entertaining, but not a must-read. Luther Krank, disgusted by the amount he and his family spent on last Christmas and how little they have to show for it, decides that his family will skip Christmas this year and instead go on a cruise. After all, daughter Blair has gone to Peru to work in the Peace Corps, so it will just be Luther and Nora. Why shouldn't they save all that money and use it on something more enjoyable and relaxing? The Kranks don't put up a tree, don't send Christmas cards, don't have their traditional Christmas Eve party. Their neighbors and friends are incredulous, especially when the Kranks don't even put Frosty on their roof, a neighborhood tradition. However, skipping Christmas isn't as easy as Luther thinks it will be and when the unexpected happens, he finds out what Christmas is really all about.<br />While entertaining and a definite departure for Grisham, this novel left something to be desired. I thought that the Kranks' spending on Christmas in the past was WAY over the top (get real - $300 for Christmas cards?!?!?) and their idea to skip Christmas was fine, but they went overboard with it. The reactions of the neighbors on Hemlock Street was also beyond believable. I found them to be just a bunch of nosy meddlers, and annoying, to boot!<br />This is a book to check out of the library - skip buying it.

But, she feels that she has to prove not only is she an outstanding employee (she's a fund manager in London's City) but she's also Supermom. Hilarious and also sad episodes follow. Very poignant, yet humourous look at a working mom's life.<br />Wow - what a great book! I read this just after I finished Tending Roses by Lisa Wingate and though the tone and writing styles are polar opposites, the message is essentially the same. As a late twentysomething with no kids, I am devouring these books about women who are trying to \\"have it all\\". I certainly recommend this book!
B00004RFCM|4.0|Interesting that one of the more negative posters here makes an issue of Sarah Jessica Parker's appearance.  Kinda blows one's credibility, I'd say.  Still, while it seems that most reviewers either love or hate this series, there IS a kind of middle ground, at least as far as this first season goes.  It's all frothy fun: sharply written and very well acted, photographed and directed.  But SEX AND THE CITY's first year falls a few notches shy of greatness.  Maybe it's because, ultimately, the characters really are a little annoying in their shallowness--although like most people you get to know over time, you get to like them better after a while and forgive them their foibles, at least somewhat.  I think the real problem may be the show's brevity.  It probably doesn't clock in any shorter than any network sitcom, but it seems to be trying to say more, do more, be more.  And that's hard to do in 20-some minutes.
6305882592|5.0|The editor's review of this film is a fair enough description of the plot.  One should add that, despite being made in 1971, the movie manages not to look dated, precisely because it makes such fun of the early 70s style, and that the acting by the three main characters (Harold, Maude and Harold's mother) is simply inspired.  Ruth Gordon is splendid of course, while Bud Cort gives a lifetime performance, but it is the portrayal of Harold's mother by Vivian Pickles (what a splendid name for someone in the role) that has to be the most undercelebrated aspect of this film.  Her breezy blitheness, outraged exasperation, and British sensibility are all just too wonderful.<br /><br />But before I go on ...<br /><br />NOTE: It has been been pointed out to me that since some would consider this review to contain spoilers that I ought to warn people ahead of time. However, I'll add that it's  hard to say how much spoilers actually spoil this movie; spoilers may help to make the movie's wisdom more readily apparent on a first viewing.  In any case, there are several ahead.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL NOTE: Some Amazonites have complained that they encountered spoilers in my review despite presumably reading my disclaimer and warning (above) that there are spoilers in my review. I find this odder than some of Harold's mother's behavior, and it makes me want to ask, without at all intending sarcasm, \\"If you didn't appreciate the disclaimer when you read it, how will reading spoilers harm your appreciation of the film?\\" ... To paraphrase Maude: \\"Ah people ....\\" (They're my species.) ... Meanwhile, back at the review:<br /><br />Filling out a dating questionnaire for her son, in response to the question \\"Do you find the idea of wife-swapping offensive?\\" his mother answers, \\"I find the question offensive.\\" In response to the question, \\"Do you feel the women's liberation movement has gone too far,\\" she replies, \\"It cer-tain-ly has.\\"  Even \\"Harold, eat your beets\\" is delivered so wonderfully that it's memorable.  Eric Christmas also makes the bit-part of a priest into something delightful and memorable, principally by one splendid monologue.<br /><br />But is this really a black comedy?  Personally, I think of black comedies as being morbid and mordant, which Harold & Maude certainly has elements of, but also ultimately cynical.  One should not mistake grimness in a film as a sign of nihilism; as the Japanese proverb runs, the ending is all-important.  The film ultimately is not about an intergenerational love affair (surely the most \\"shocking\\" aspect of the film), but about Harold learning to embrace life. And it is precisely to make as effective as possible Harold's decision to live life to the fullest (rather than continue to prefer to be dead)  that it is first necessary to make his life miserable.<br /><br />As insanely amusing as much of the movie is, it is also full of profundity after profundity from Maude, who is a nearly continuous font of wisdom, with laughter and humor being simply the most crucial values in her wisdom.  When she asks Harold what he does for fun, he takes her to a picnic in a wrecking yard.  She replies, \\"I'll grant you, it has a certain something. But is it enough?\\"  When Harold declines her offer of wine, she replies, \\"Oh go on, it's organic.\\" And most beautiful of all, when Harold says, \\"I don't want you to die, Maude. I love you,\\" she replies with perfect calmness, \\"Harold, that's wonderful. Now go out and love some more.\\"  If you've been caught up in the genuine spirit of this movie, the line will not seem like some breezy brush-off, but may instead bring tears to your eyes.<br /><br />The scene of Harold's grief after Maude's death, intercutting silent images of him waiting in a hospital room and driving recklessly around the Marin headlands in the Jaguar he has converted into a hearse while Cat Steven's song, \\"Trouble\\" plays, is very well-done and sets up the climax of the film beautifully.  Cat Steven's soundtrack throughout, in fact, is a splendid selection of songs, and certainly makes clear that, however morbid things might seem, this film is ultimately life-affirming in a very profound way.<br /><br />Having watched this movie many, many times and having yet to tire of it, it seems to me there is more to it than meets the eye.  And not just because, when Harold gives Maude an engraved birthday gift, she says, \\"This is the nicest gift anyone has given me in a long time,\\" and then throws it into the San Francisco Bay saying, \\"That way, I'll always know where it is.\\" And not just because one eventually notices, in the briefest of passing shots, the tattoo of a concentration camp inmate on Maude's arm.  In the final analysis, it seems to me that Harold is actually already dead. That his theatrical suicides aren't faked at all, but also don't succeed because he himself is not aware that he's actually dead.  It's probably more accurate to say that the director pushes the narrative to the point where Harold seems to be actually dead and not just faking, precisely to make his choice of life at the end all the more inspiring.<br /><br />And inspiring it is.  Harold & Maude is not (alas) for everyone.  A viewer who is hidebound like the movie's priest, colonel or mother (read church, state, authority) will find Maude's sometimes gentle, sometimes brash mocking of convention more annoying than enlightening, just as the (not depicted) sexual relationship between Harold and Maude is the thing many people who miss the point remember about the movie.  To this, Maude might say, as she does to a police officer, \\"Don't be officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.\\" Or as she says, when the priest replies that he didn't like the way she'd painted his statue of the Virgin Mary, \\"Give it time. It'll grow on you. Some things take a while to appreciate.\\"k throughout, in fact, is a splendid selection of songs, and certainly makes clear that, however morbid things might seem, this film is ultimately life-affirming in a very profound way.<br /><br />Having watched this movie many, many times and having yet to tire of it, it seems to me there is more to it than meets the eye.

B00005JKJA|5.0|The other reviews are very thoughtful and worthwhile, but I personally believe this film is not an example of Eastern philosophy or specific meanings of any kind, but rather of pure dream-on-film. As such, you can make many interpretations, but it is Lynch's genius to create a work that enables and even inspires people to do so. In that sense it is like a particularly striking dream you might have - it keeps you speculating about its meaning with its vivid details and compelling images, yet never fully reveals its true nature. <br />The actors do an excellent job with their difficult and sometimes intensely intimate roles, and the production values are uniformly high. Among the scenes that are most memorable are two of the most terrifying nightmares ever committed to celluloid - the narrated nightmare of the young man in the cafe near the beginning, which is one of the only filmed scenes to approach actual nightmares I have had in their intensity and suggestiveness, and the implied nightmare of the discovery of the heroine's dead body - by herself - in a seedy apartment. <br />But beyond everything else in this film, it is Lynch's mastery of surrealism and cinema that make this his best film since \\"Eraserhead.\\"
B000002KHH|4.0|I am always amazed when I read tirads about old rock and roll being dated from its CD release date. In this case, Paranoid was released on vinyl in 1970. A CD (remastered? doesn't sound like it) was released in 1990. Music Fan reminds me of the drunk gen Xer I heard arguing with a guy in a bar that Jimi Hendrix, not Bob Dylan, wrote &quot;All Along the Watchtower.&quot;<br />Anyhow, if you wonder how metal got started, this is a good waypoint in your exploration, muddy riffs and all. This is a classic.
1563898586|5.0|This book, like most of Alan Moore's work, has a great story, interesting to read writing, parallells, twists, and multiple layers of enjoyment.
0316666343|1.0|I thought that I would really like this book.  In fact, I like how it started out, but I just lost interest.  It just seemed to go on and on without ever really going anywhere.  My book club just discoverd a new writer who is a friend of a friend kinda thing, but I think that this unknown writer I am reading now is much better! It's too bad I can't create as much hype for her book.  My club is reading ANGEL LOVER by Cynthia Cody.
0783219598|5.0|This is one of my top five favorite movies of all time. I am 39 and female. If I need a pick me up, I put on this movie. Others have said that this is a depressing and unhappy movie. There certainly are sad parts. But, life is sometimes sad and Babe's consistantly upbeat attitude with life always lifts my spirit. The last scene with the sheep always brings tears to my eyes. I haven't shared this movie with my 2 year old son yet. But, one day, I want him to see it. The real lesson this film sends is life can be tough and hard but that we can find beauty and happiness when we try. What better lesson can we teach a child?
0684803356|5.0|Hemingway and his simplistic style of writing live on in the stories he tells and represents.Through his writing you can tell that this is a man with the best of both worlds, in that he is not only a great writer but orator as well. This fact is why the trueness of his stories live on as if he's telling us the story himself right from the book. Robert Jordan and his gang of rebels are a reflection of a Spanish Civil War in which they live by there feelings toward politics, but their representation in the war is a hidden treasure behind the depths of mountains and lost memory in hope that this saga lives on forever.
B000002HGD|2.0|i had a single from this album and a song called IN MY LIFE completely rocked my world...      MY MISTAKE.  do not call this album techno.  call it top 40, or electronic but not techno and do not call it punk rock inflenced or even rock oriented.  there is little rock on this album.  this album is the predeccesor to play.  if thats your bag then by all means this is for you but it is a bland mix of top 40 wanna be music.         i also bought animal rights by moby.  THAT is quite electic with a good mix of musical styles...        yes i did like the soothing intro of hymn, the funky beat of lets go free (song is 37 seconds long) and the blues of what love but this is not a reason to keep this overrated mess.  although i do love the thought provoking essays in moby's cd's but otherwise this is not worth your time.
B0000009SI|5.0|Frank zappa is amazing. The first four tracks are hilarious, as is cosmik debris, a story about a run in with a drug dealer. Uncle remus is a really groovy song, he really jams on the whole album. this was my first zappa album, and i was hooked as soon as i heard the first song. The only songs that drag on are Excentrifugal Forz and Stink-Foot, they're pretty bad. overnite sensation is even better, dinah-moe humm is...amazing. yes, zappa is real retro,...disco
B000001Y2U|5.0|combining industrial strength intensity with death metal riffing, sprinkled with a goth feel, marilyn manson gave us the monster album that caused quite a stir in its day and gave me christian right advocates protesting when i went to see it live.  <BR>     i think this album is spectacular in lieu of trent reznor's influence not because of.  sometimes using a drum machine, other times live drums give this album a great feel.  you can never tell if the music is the result of man or machine but you always the emotion is real.  <BR>     if the music had no substance, marilyn would not be around.  he would be dismissed as a goof but this album is truly the goods delivered.  marilyn brings us the carnival evil of his imagination.  the music is hard, heavy, fast and furious.  he is dark and angry and yet sad and sensitive at the same time.  <BR>     the chainsaw guitars buzz their way through your sanity as marilyn paints such a wonderfully weird and twisted world.  the throbbing bass coupled with the almost mechanical yet explosive drums truly inspire this monumental album.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's new albulm, or if you asked her. Her first albulm because it displays her. Kicking off with the new female anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" she attacks right from the start. With help from Lil Kim, also a woman of independent means, this song queenches the fire men thought they had. \\"Walk Away\\", my favorite song and in my opinion the best on the albulm because it displays her at her best vocally and you can hear the pain in her voice. Just when you though she couldn't do it all, she throughs in songs like \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Make Over\\" just to silence all critics. With songs like \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Loving Me for Me\\" Christina expresses a sincere side of music making, both obviously about Jorge and both spectacular. The new anthem ... \\"Beautiful\\" and the soulful \\"Impossible\\" show that even when she does not do the writing, Christina has the talent and the heart to make any song her own. ANother highligh for me is the female anthem for sexually equality. \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" proves that despite the hype, Chritisna is still a real woman with real needs and desires. \\"Dirrty\\", despite anyone else's opinion is my other favorite on the albulm. Great beat, great lyrics, great video, and produced by her. 10s across the board girl. \\"Stripped\\" shows it's introspective side best on ballads such as \\"Soar\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Cruz\\", and \\"The Voice Within\\". Even the painfully chilling and honest \\"I'm OK\\" shows that Christina has the strength to confront demons of her past. Demons that help make her the amazing woman and astounding vocalist and mucisian that the world already knows she is. \\"Stripped\\" is by far the vest albulm of 2002-2003.
B000001Y5X|5.0|while later albums were heavier and darker and maybe better produced, this is still one amazing trip.  it is willy wonka meets almost nursery rhyme-esque lyrics.  it is, as stated by another reviewer spooky kids rock.  <BR>    daisy berkowitz was, probably, manson's best guitar player, much more creative than any of his followers.  his inventive guitar lines really paint he music with an originality that some of his later albums sometimes lack.  <BR>     this album is one of manson's more original (each album is its own entity to me) there was no hype or rock and roll politics or christian right to answer to.  there was just great music full of youth gone wild antics and the sick depraved and wonderfully twisted world of marilyn.  i did not hear a lick of music when i first bought this album.  i read the lyrics while wiaiting at a friends house(yes laura this means you.  to see the downward spiral tour of nin. i read the lyrics and had the album the next day.  i loved the sick twisted mind marilyn has.  then i heard the music.  it still melts my soul.  <BR>     personally twiggy ramiriz is manson's best bass player (his departure forces me to fear the future) but this is still a major album to adore.
B00006YXEK|3.0|BRAINWASHED is a CD you have to listen to a couple of times before you can appreciate it.  For the most part, this recording is a \\"back to basics\\" effort without any added orchestrations.  With a total of 12 tracks, the CD is a bit scanty when you compare it to other Harrison efforts.  No doubt Harrison's untimley passing left the selection of songs and compilation of this CD to others.  Two tracks of note are ANY ROAD and BRAINWASHED.  BRAINWASHED is a lively rocker performed in Harrison stlye.  About the only things restraining BRAINWASHED from being a hit song are the mantras that appear toward the end of the song.  The special box set appears to be more of a marketing ploy than a Harrison designed product.  Inside there is a thin booklet, guitar pick, small folded poster and a DVD.  The DVD is somewhat about the making of the album and it is too bad that it is only a few minutes long.  The production of the DVD is high quality and there are short snipets of some great interviews with George Harrison.<br />I am sure there are numerous other Harrison recordings secreted away and no doubt next year will bring a \\"Harrison Anthology\\" of sorts.  Until then, BRAINWASHED is last true Harrison effort and worthy of being added to a collection.
0316666343|5.0|I just finished The Lovely Bones and wanted to see what else Alice Sebold had to offer. I loved her story. I think if nothing else it makes you feel good that the people you love are still with you. It warmed my heart to know that Susie could watch her sister grow up and not miss the most important events in her family's lives. I would be suprised if someone did not love this book.
B000069KE0|5.0|This is Chicago at the real beginning of their career...and this second album is by far their greatest.  Compared to all their later material (even without Terry Kath), this is the group's finest hour.  The centerpiece of the album, James Pankow's rock opera, \\"Ballet For A Girl In Buchanon\\" (which spawned the hit singles \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"Colour My World\\"), alone is worth the cost of this album.  Pankow's cantata, written after The Who's \\"Tommy\\" but before Webber/Rice's \\"Jesus Christ, Superstar\\", may have been Chicago's only attempt at a rock opera, but it is an example of Chicago's innovative sound.  All praise, however, should be given to Pankow, and not the group, for propelling this album to great heights.  If you're looking for an album to start your Chicago collection, this is it.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I have to say, when I first heard the cast of the Movie Rendition of the Musical Chicago, I giggled a bit.  However, I was blown away with the movie, and this CD just gives me my fix until the DVD comes out.  The songs from the movie, especially my favorites, All that Jazz (I love it when the start stops, and the little beat starts the second part of the song, bum bum bum, etc..), When you're good to Momma, Razzle Dazzle, We both reached for the gun, and my two favorites (almost like picking your favorite kids) Cell Block Tango and Mr. Cellophane.  Cell block tango because you just can't not do the tango to that darn song.  Also, Mr Cellophane because of the buildup from lowly sap to envigorating (sp?) conclusion.  His dance in the movie is a must see, as is the whole movie!  The only suspect parts are the new songs, The Queen Latifah/Macy Gray/Lil Kim song.  It is too cookie cutter for a musical, now movie, that was/is way ahead of its time.  Anastacia, well, whatever.  I thought i could only listen to it once, well, i was right, once every hour or so.  Enjoy it, as I have and will.
B00004ZD69|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I am a fan of many different genres of music, and after hearing so many great things about this band thought, I'd give them a try.<BR>I knew from the get go it was going to be long and repetitious, I have no problem with that (I'm a huge Philip Glass fan).<BR>The bottom line here is that the music is simply not that interesting. It has none of the seminal qualities of minmalism and none of the hooks of popular music. It's not that it's unpleasant to listen to, it's just not the sort of thing that will make you want to hear more.<BR>In a word, bland.
B00006RAKP|1.0|Elton John is one of a handful of preeminent songwriter/performers of the past half century.  His work will be held as a standard for any individual who sits on a piano bench and puts his face to a microphone.  About this album -- where is the sinew and muscle from this man's career?  The albums &quot;Tumbleweed Connection,&quot; &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; contained masterpiece material.  Where in the world is &quot;Burn Down the Mission,&quot; &quot;Love Lies Bleeding,&quot; &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; and Good Lord knows how many others.  Here's the question -- Who picked this stuff?
0312243022|3.0|Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS has been much adored as an homage to Virginia Wolf's MRS. DALLOWAY. The novel, of course, tells three interlocking stories, after first beginning with the narrative of Woolf's suicide in 1941. It tells of Woolf's attempts at starting the novel in 1923, while in enforced isolation with her husband at Hogarth House in Richmond; of Laura Brown, a post-war Los Angeles suburban housewife's unravelling on a day when she read the novel for the first time; and of \\"Clarissa Vaughn,\\" a contemporary woman much like Clarissa Dalloway herself who prepares a party to honor her dearest friend who is dying of AIDS on the day he is to win a major literary award.<br />The first and second strands of Cunningham's novel are lovely. Cunningham admirably brings something new to our conception of Virginia Woolf and her complicated relations with her sister, husband and servants. His second strand, \\"Mrs. Brown\\" (a tribute, of course, to Woolf's famous essay \\"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\\" and its conception of what 20th-century authors owe to their characters), is the most beautiful and original section of the book: Laura Brown does seem to carry out luminously Woolf's exhortation for contemporary authors to represent faithfully the inner life. But it is in the third strand, the contemporary story, that the book doesn't come off at all. rather than as a postmodern homage, the section reads as a simultaneously bad and derivative imitative of MRS. DALLOWAY: I found myself cringing in these sections at Cunningham's weak imitations of Woolf's plot and prose. Despite its ingenious and noble intentions, this sequence prevents the novel, in the end, from fully deserving the praise it has garnered.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is an epic adventure to a deeper meaning of life<br />when you first listen to this album, you are in awe, much like thoese who graced their ears with \\"Tommy\\" by \\"The Who\\"<br />The Grudge - This first song starts with a sound much like the turning on of a machine, and pounds the beats into your brain. Maynard is a god, and Adam and Justin are in perfect unison, but the real gold is in Danny, this song is one of the opiates of the drummer.<br />Eon BLue Apacloypse - a 1:00 minute guitar-bass duet, which lets the imagination run wild<br />The Patiant - after the deepness of Eon Blue Apaclypose, this song starts to make your mind humble. It is sadening, yet, angering...... it really makes you think<br />Mantra - An electronic specticle that also sends the imagination wild.<br />Schism - Meaning to seperate, it is a turning point of the album, were it becomes more agressive. The most radio-friendly song, and it is great.<br />Parabol - This song returns to a mellow, that lets you reflect on life.........<BR>Parabola - Without a pause, adam sends a creshendo that awakes you, and goes into the most main-stream ballad of the album. A Hint of Rush can be heard.<br />Ticks and Leeches - THis song remains close to what the what previous tool fans knew. Much like Stinkfist, or Aenema, MAynards schreaching vocals are amazing. Danny again floors the rest of the drumming comunity.......... (Probably my 2nd favorite song off the album)<br />Lateralis - Another ballad, probably the second most known song of the album( Schism being first) this song is inspireing. When the mellow interlude comes about, you are once again humbled by his lyrical skill. When the climatic \\"With my feet upon the ground, i lose my self between the sound, and open up to suck it in, i feal it move across my skin......\\" really opens you up to a new Philosophy of life (i listened to this song for a few hours, and i feal like a better person)<br />(Now, the album gets werider)<br />Disposition, Reflection,Triad - I put these songs as one, because it really is......there are no spaces in it. THis is another (almost) instrumental song, and it is diffently a reason to buy this album. It tells a story, and lets your mind make it acording to the music.......a truley conceptual and brillian song. <br />Faaip de Oiad - This, much like \\"Disgustipated\\" is a song about the end of the world. However, this one is different. After the two minute space inserted, a former emplyee of Area-51 is on the run because alieans are about to take over the world, and inslave humanity. But this is probably the most brilliant song, becuase when you listen to it, the fear in his voice is so real, that you then question what the album was acctually about, and it almost commands you to listen to the whole thing again (I did)<br />This album is really a masterpiece, and should be baught by EVERYONE
B000002UJQ|5.0|Quite honestly, there probably isn't much I can tell you about this CD that hasn't already been said.  Just review the facts.  Radiohead is quite possibly the best band since the Beatles.  This is their best CD.  If you've taken the time to get this far in the buying process, then you have to be somewhat interested.  Assuming you are interested, there is no way that this CD can disappoint you.  You don't have to buy it on this site - just make sure you get it.
B0000640VN|4.0|All I have to say about &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is that it is a sweet, romantic movie that undoubtedly falls under the category of &quot;Chick Flick&quot;. Hugh Jackman's preformance as a 19th century English duke is almost the only thing that makes this movie worth watching. He's handsome, charming, and courteous...everything a woman ever wants in a man. Meg Ryan, however, was grievously mis-cast in her role as modern-day career woman. There wasn't much chemistry between her and Hugh and you can tell she wasn't quite feeling it. But still, the movie isn't a COMPLETE loss. The idea of Hugh Jackman as this gorgeous, perfectly chivalrous duke sweeping you off your feet is enough to merit watching it. The costumes are brilliant and the sets are beautiful. The script was also nicely written, must give props to the filmmakers for that. Overall...the movie has a sweet feel to it and when it's over...it'll make you wish you had someone like Hugh to cuddle up with!
B000006TRV|5.0|Pete Townshend did it with \\"Tommy\\"...Andrew Lloyd Webber did it with \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\"...James Pankow did it with Chicago's \\"Ballet For A Girl In Buchanon\\"...and Roger Waters does it for Pink Floyd with \\"The Wall\\".  An epic rock opera in every sense of the word.  The concept of this 1979 album is nothing new, obviously, but Pink Floyd tackles rock opera in style.  This story of a has-been rocker who creates a psychological \\"wall\\" to shelter his problems until chance forces him to face reality is Pink Floyd's greatest work.  It stands alongside \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" as their best album.  It has been told numerous ways...this original album, the stage production, the MGM movie, and the Berlin Wall performance...although it is disturbing, it is perhaps an enlightening experience.  This is the greatest rock opera ever recorded by anyone...even surpassing Pankow's Chicago \\"Ballet\\".  Listen to it from beginning to end!
0783239955|5.0|This movie made my day.  I left work early, emotionally drained, physically exhausted and happened on a gem of a film.  This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen.  It truly picked me up because I never stopped laughing...returned to work the next day with big smile on my face.  One of the few films I didn't want to end!
B000006045|5.0|I rarely try music other than metal, yet a few techno artists out there are versatile enough to appeal to all.  Massive Attack is one such group.  The atmosphere of the songs is dark and moody, effecting mellowness in the listener.  The first track, \\"Angel\\", is widely played, especially in movies (i.e. Snatch).  The fourth track is my favorite, probably because it makes me remember the Victoria's Secret commercial it was used in.  All of the tracks are great, however, and make this disc an absolute necessity.
B000069HKH|3.0|Admittedly, I don't worship the ground Bruce walks on -- he's made a career out of trying to remain an average guy.  This album has a pretty coherant feel, but some songs hit a lot closer than others.  His reachings for anthem, rah-rah U.S.A. music take up about half of the album, personally, I can do without just about all of those tunes.<br />Listen to Mary's Place once, maybe twice, then realize that Bruce needs to stay away from beach music.  Seeing this one in concert was probably the largest feeling of the &quot;okay okay, enough already&quot; response.<br />Dispite much of the album that I could do without, there are a handful of songs that, regardless of social trends and immediate history that inspired them, aren't bad for a pretty solid rock feel (The Rising, The Fuse, Lonesome Day), and, dispite his jumping on the bandwagon of major western artists putting out a song with PC middle-eastern overtones (See Sting's Desert Rose, et al in the past few years.), Worlds Apart is a solid song.<br />I'll say that the album and the concerts didn't live up to my hopes and expectations, but he still added a few good songs to his collection (worth picking up second hand, new is questionable.)
B00005NWM3|1.0|wow.......how horrible.....hey, wait, we could use this for peaceful warfare....you know, just blast this at iraq or wherever dubyah wants to steal his oil from, and then all the residents will just blow their brains out, and we won't have any mass murder of innocent civilians to send the cia to cover up (oops, said too much)...make sure to send a picture of this guy's mug, that's some scary stuff, man........wait a sec, chico...maybe cobain heard this, like in a vision from the future, before he made wall art with his grey matter....makes yah think, don't it?
0790729342|5.0|Movie:<BR>The Road Warrior, set seven or so years after the events of Mad Max. Max is now a heartless man, wandering the wastlands of the outback. The third world war has left the world in total ruin, and many have turned to the cruelness of the gangs that rule the wastland. The few that maintain the humanity are few. Max stumbles apon an little sliver of civilization which is constantly assulted by evil biker gangs. Soon he finds himself involved in their flight for survival. The last chase scean is epic compaired to anythng made to date. This movie as many movie buffs like me say, is possibly the best Action/Scific movie ever made. One might think that it is a very poor movie to the small amont of talking, this just adds to the brillance of the movie! This is kind of like Star Wars: Even if you don't like it, you have to see it at least once. <BR>Movie 5 out of 5 stars<BR>DVD:<BR>Whoever owns the rights to this breakthrough-of-a-movie is out of his mind! Shure the picture and sound quality is good, but look at the extras! Zero, nada, zip. What a good way to ruin a great movie's DVD!<BR>DVD: 1 out of 5 stars
0316666343|4.0|I thought this book was a very enjoyable read. It certainly was a different idea and an entertaining one. The writing was well done, the characters were interesting without too much detail to bore the reader. In fact, I disagree with a previous reviewer who felt the characters weren't developed enough....I believe any further development would have detracted from the story. I thought the author's idea of writing it through the eyes of a child in heaven was absolutely ingenious! I would (in fact, I have) recommend this book to a friend. The ending was not the &quot;Hollywood&quot; cliche either which, in my mind, added much to the story.
6304479697|5.0|I have read some reviews on the original video and the restored DVD.<BR>I remember watching Elvis that's the way it is at the movies. I have been a fan of Elvis's for about 30 years now. I loved the video. The new DVD is great and I wouldn't give it up for all the money in the world. But I agree with some of the reviews. I wouldn't have minded if they took away some of the interviews with the fans, but they took out some footage that was really Elvis. It showed the real Elvis, joking with the guys etc. and they took that away. The extra footage is great. I would like to see a new DVD with the original in full and also the added footage.<BR>LONG LIVE THE KING.
0393312836|4.0|When I picked up this book, I read the first few sentences and found myself completely confused.  You see, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" contains a little bit of this language Burgess made up that is supposedly Russian slang.  Regardless, I kept reading and in a few chapters I had picked up most of the vocabularly.  It actually became fun trying to decifer the words that Burgess refers to as the Nasdat language.<br />This book is about a young boy named Alex who runs around with his friends and terrorizes society.  They steal, they rape, and they beat people.  All is well for Alex until he gets caught by the police.  He then undergoes experimental treatment at a correction facility.  This treatment was suppose to make it so he could no longer do harm; however, it doesn't all go exactly as planned.<br />This is a dark novel based a bit into the future where the night is run by villans such as Alex and his gang.  It is well written and a joy to read.  Plus, even though some people disagree, the book is actually pretty humorous.  Well worth the read.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a beautifully animated movie, called Mononoke Hime in Japanese.  The music is...all I'm going to say is &quot;Arigatou, Joe Hisashi!&quot;  Yes, it does have some blood and gore, namely samurai cutting each other's heads and limbs off in battle.  It's based on a Japanese poem, and contains a bunch of references to feudal Japanese culture, such as the kodama and the forest spirit.  Otherwise, it's a wonderful story.  Have fun!  (Note that this review was written by a fifteen year old otaku (anime fan))
6304539282|4.0|It seems that it's already obvious that it would be a waste of three exceptional films not to release the original Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. Sadly, this can't happen until after the release of 2005's Episode III, when George Lucas will have some free time to concentrate on it. Then, it will still take some time to put together the bonus materials (documentaries, trailers, cast interviews, etc.) that fans have been waiting for for over two decades. Also, the cover art would have to be slightly altered, to resemble the patterns of the Episodes I and II (and inevitably III) covers. That way, they'll LOOK more like a series of six movies, and not just two seperate trilogies.
0812550706|5.0|I've read this book probably 15 times.  Somehow I find something new to enjoy each time I read it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I found this album to be a return to form on the part of Wilco.  It doesn't sound anything like A.M., but it resembles that album in that it includes all original music.  Being There to some extent, but especially Summerteeth, sounded like montages of 60s and 70s songs.  I didn't dislike those albums, but I found them to be a bit on the clever side.  With Yankee Hotel Foxtrot one finds Tweedy and company going back to making their own music without wearing their cultural preferences on their sonic sleeves.<br />YHF is a dense album.  I saw the movie I Am Trying to Break Your Heart and that gave me an idea of how much time the band spent in the studio making this album.  From the point of view of the punk ideals that they started out with back in the Uncle Tupelo days, the band spent way, way too much time in the studio.  A lot of other reviewers here have been quite irate about Wilco's refusal to remain an alt-country band.  Well, sorry, but there were probably a lot of people who started to lose interest in the Beatles after Rubber Soul, so go figure.<br />The songs here are beautiful, especially &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Hear&quot;, &quot;Kamera&quot;, &quot;Jesus Etc.&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;.  If the band simply played these songs straight, as I suppose they must in concert, unless they resort to MIDI gimmicks or something, then this would simply have been another good Wilco album.  And, I aver, sound a lot like A.M.  But instead they labored over, fussed with and generally obsessed about these songs, tore them apart and put them back together again with a lot of noise in between and on all sides of the music.  They went from being just songs to sonic landscapes.  If you don't like that sort of thing, then forget about this album.<br />It seems to be difficult for some fans to grow up along with their favorite band.  Guys like Jeff Tweedy are constantly trying to grow as songwriters, arrangers and musicians.  They can't keep doing the sameold thing or they will go nuts.  By putting out challenging music like that on YHF, Wilco is showing a certain amount of faith in their fans.  They are assuming that you want to grow up with them.  <br />If, on the other hand, you would prefer that Wilco keep on remaking the soundtrack to your footloose-and-fancy days of high school and/or college, so that you can continue to pretend you're having fun in spite of being trapped in a cubicle and worrying about your mortgage and car payments, then ...  Well, I think you've got two choices.  (1) Really listen to what Tweedy et al.  are saying and doing on this album or (2) keeping listening to Uncle Tupelo and A.M. and don't worry, be happy.
B000069AUI|5.0|And its name is Coldplay.....<br />I know - I know - Lester Bangs used those very words to describe Bruce Springsteen back in 1975.  But the same euphoric praise must be heaped upon &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; - Coldplay's sophomore (but hardly sophomoric) effort.  This CD is an exhilarating, shimmering, eargasmic onslaught of such aural delights that a five-star rating doesn't do it justice.  &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is joyously reminiscent of U2 in its early days.  Indeed, &quot;Clocks&quot; evokes the same sensory idyll as did &quot;Rejoice&quot; from U2's &quot;October&quot; LP in 1981: the same incandescent harmonies; the same passionate and fiery splendor; the same stirring melodies and inventiveness.  If your knowledge of Coldplay is restricted to the 1999 Best Actress winner and her latest paramour, run - don't walk - to your nearest record store and buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed.
0316666343|2.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" was one of the big sellers of 2002, and I guess I can see why. Reading it is a lot like watching a made-for-TV movie, of the \\"disease-of-the-week\\" variety. It's written in a vague, gauzy, imprecise way.<br /><br />It's impossible to really put oneself into the story, you're always held at arms length by the lack of envisioned detail. One example: after she is murdered, dismembered, and her body parts are stuffed into an old safe, the murderer takes the safe to a local sinkhole to be disposed of. She has been there before; her father brought her along when he dumped an old refrigerator. But there's no description of it, no watching the safe (or the refrigerator) sinking down into the hole. It could have been a marvelous scene, in the hands of someone like Barbara Kingsolver, but it's abandoned.<br /><br />Again, she used to help her father make ships in bottles, and his workroom has a cabinet of empty bottles, waiting to house ships. But are they coke bottles? Gin bottles? Gallon vinegar bottles? Another wonderful opportunity wasted.<br /><br />The only part of her that's found is her dismembered elbow, which the killer dropped. I found it hard to envision how the murderer would have dismembered her in such a way as to end up with a loose elbow. (I'm not pushing for more gore and violence on the page, but to include such a gruesome detail without explaining how it could have come about seems like another example of carelessness to me.)<br /><br />As a father (of both a son and a daughter) the most objectionable aspect of the book is its portrayal of that this death isn't really so bad. As Seybold tells it, abduction, rape and murder of a child appears to be rather like getting a root canal - a scary prospect, and unpleasant while it happens, but afterwards, you wonder why you made such a fuss. It's unfortunate that she's been raped and murdered, of course, but it's much harder on those left behind than on her: she can eavesdrop, and apparently read minds as well, she can project herself into events on earth, in a way, though it's limited, and rather frustrating.<br /><br />You get your own heaven, sort of a custom job, even down to the aromas. You get to see others who've passed before you, but there's no getting to talk to Einstein or Shakespeare or Buddy Holly (this is 1974, John Lennon isn't up there yet.) And, you get an intake counselor to help you adjust.<br /><br />The good news is, death doesn't even have to end sex! She gets to temporarily inhabit someone else's body in order to have one afternoon of glorious sex with her high-school sweetheart. (He knows something's different, immediately, but I'm unclear as to whether he knew quite what was going on. A bigger question is how this girl, who's only experience with sex is rape and murder, whould think it'd be fun to give it another try.)<br /><br />There's no real effort to examine what could turn this man into a child-rapist/murderer. He has abducted and killed neighborhood pets, and the heroine isn't his first victim, but he's careful, and hasn't been caught. Just another cardboard character, like the witch cutouts you put up at halloween.<br /><br />The only realistically portrayed character is the wonderfully over-the-top Grandma Lynn. The kids, generally, don't talk or act like kids, but they don't in TV movies either, so that isn't surprising.ntly read minds as well, she can project herself into events on earth, in a way, though it's limited, and rather frustrating. <br /> <br />You get your own heaven, sort of a custom job, even down to the aromas.

B000002UTY|5.0|Great no questions about it probably the worlds greatest guitarest to ever live, and I would have said Clapton was always the best. In the solo Who Do You Love you hear Cippolina at his best but then again every album I have listened to; he's at his best even in Happy Trails!
B0000797IO|1.0|I can't believe Jennifer Aniston was in this movie.  I have really enjoyed all of her previous movies.  I guess she was trying to break the good girl persona.  It was awful.  After watching, I thought to myself, why???  I could have done so much more with my 2 hours.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This music stands with Astral Weeks, Sgt Pepper, and Blonde on Blonde, and Big Pink. <br />It's stark, and overwhelming, and so beautiful...<br />All of the songs you thought you knew you didn't. You haven't heard 'Bridge Over Trouble Waters.' Paul Simon couldn't have meant this much when he wrote it.  Cash couldn't have understood 'Give My Love To Rose' when he wrote it. 'In My Life' was pretty sentiment, then.  Here, it is a bedrock statement, a will, a legacy of dignity and love.<br />Listen here to a Great American Hero, a hero like Whitman, or Ginsberg, or Hawthorne or Woody Guthrie.  Listen here to the reason that John Ford made 'Fort Apache,' and Pynchon wrote<BR>'Gravity's Rainbow,' and Nicholson became Jake in 'Chinatown.' <br />People, this is the sound of a man dying, with the strength, grace and the dignity of an angel, or a cowboy.  Thank Christ that you were alive to hear him.
B00005NWM3|2.0|There really is no point giving a song by song review of Silver Side Up because there are such minor differences between each song. Nickelback make generic made-for-radio angst rock. When it comes down to it, they're really just a heavier Matchbox 20, or is that 3 doors down? Anyway, if you swapped the members of Nickelback with the members of 3 Doors Down, the average listener wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It's all the same commercial radio fodder. There are better more creative rock albums out there!!, i swear it!!, please beleive me!!
B000066HI4|3.0|I bought this CD because I had heard the Johnny Cash version of I See a Darkness and wanted to hear the person who wrote that haunting song.  This CD is the first I have heard of BPB.  I like some of the songs, but overall, it is SO slow and so melancholy that it becomes too much.  Makes Candy Says by the Velv. Underground sound positively upbeat.  And this is coming from someone who loves slow, minor-key music.  Also, Billy has a way of harmonizing with himself which makes it seem like he is singing out of tune.  Kind of unnerving.
0385495323|5.0|At first blush, a history of cryptology (encoding and decoding messages) would seem to be dry, boring and filled with mathematical gibberish.  Singh's masterful work is anything but.  It is exciting, nerve-wracking and  perfectly understandable even to the mathematically challenged.<br />The underlying theme of the book is the incessant battle between those who would create unbreakable codes and those would strive to break them.  His captivating anecdotes describe the historical uses of encrypted messages for purposes of romance, war-making and business... and they are all delightful.<br />It's testament to Singh's ability that even topics such as one-time pad ciphers, the inner workings of the Nazi's Enigma device, the incredibly complicated language of the Navajo code talkers and even quantum cryptology become almost easy to digest.  Throw in bonus topics like the Beale code (a fantastic story!) and the deciphering of heiroglyphics (the Rosetta Stone was not a panacea!) and you have the makings of a truly exceptional work.<br />Singh's work is as unique as it is stellar.  This is one book that anyone interested in history _must_ read.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I had always thought No Doubt was a great band, but wasn't too much of a fan.  This album rocked!  I could listen to this thing straight thru without stopping.  Now, that's what makes a good album.  It's all different and unique.  It's doesn't even have a definite sound, a great grab bag of cool sounds.  Disco-ish, techno; it's all in good fun.  I highly recommend it!  I only wish I had gotten on board when this record first came out, instead coming in two years later.  Oh, well.  They had better win a Grammy for this; this is one of the best CD's I've ever heard--ever.

B00003CXS4|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen, period.  <br />The plot: oh wait, there wasn't one.  <br />The theme: let's make an even crappier version of Ocean's Eleven, use almost the same cast, make it even more boring and pointless, and throw in some black guys with British accents.<br />The characters: wise-ass Brits that try, but really really fail at being funny (this it the kind of movie that morons say is \\"hilarious,\\" but trust me, whenever something is \\"hilarious,\\" it's not funny at all<br />The style: a bunch of really crappy cuts that are supposed to make you feel like the movie was cutting edge or some crap<br />The music: not bad, wasn't an abortion like the rest of the movie<br />The ending: the bringing together of a bunch of trivial crap that no one cares about.  It's supposed to make you go, \\"Ohhhhh, wow!\\" but it made me go, \\"Oh...okay...so?\\"<br />The verdict: seriously consider suicide as a better option than this movie...it's about as exciting as a ten minute crap
B00000099Y|5.0|I've noticed something about the negative reviews about Tool in general.  The people in every one of them claim to not \\"get it.\\"  If they don't say it, it's implied.  They think Tool's music isn't original or that it's boring or that it doesn't go anywhere.<br />Well guess what... that's too bad.  It's too bad you can't see through to the intricacies of the band, the meaning of every song (though it may be different to different people), and the skill with which the members of the band perfectly execute their art.  They have transcended the normal, the expectations of the brainwashed (by the likes of MTV), and have used creativity - god forbid - to compose something so extraordinary that yes, some people just don't \\"get it.\\"<br />Maybe I'm speaking a bit too much about Lateralus, which I would rank slightly above this album.  But Aenima is good as well.  In fact, very good, good enough to merit five stars.  This review comes a little late, perhaps, when just about everything that can be said about Aenima already has been, but six years after its release, Aenima still has the capacity to stagger those who give it try, and for those who have already tried it, another listen just may reveal a magical something that you previously missed.
0316666343|5.0|If you're looking for a touching story about the grieving process, this is the book for you.  \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is the story of Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is raped and killed by a neighbor.  Susie tells the story herself, looking down from heaven, a clever perspective that touched me. Several years ago, my brother died (under different circumstances), and reading Susie's perspective on how her family moved on made me realize it was ok for me to do the same.  Several parts of the book touched me so much I cried.  At the end, Susie has an exchange with Ruth and Ray that is kind of weird, but I think the rest of the story is extremely believable.  Yes, it is a little cheesy, and it is an easy read.  Reading it won't raise your I.Q.  However, it may heighten your understanding of the human heart.

1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle creates the possibility of living a life free from anxiety, worry and self-doubt.  In a direct and intimate way, as if you and Eckhart were sitting together talking, he describes the habitual and culturally-embedded behaviors that people unconsciously recreate and the ways to dissolve them.  Freeing yourself from these behaviors is much simpler than our minds would assume: he says that it takes being present to your life and simply observing what is.  I found this to be a refreshing relief. He describes thinking as an affliction and a disease.  At first, I found this shocking, as thinking is something that is so much a part of me and I certainly hadnt considered myself diseased by it.  But when I looked at all of the ways in which my judgments, resentments and complaints  all thought-generated  are futile and irrelevant to the reality of my life, I saw the truth in this description of thinking.  It is a hindrance to living in the moment and being fully alive. The Power of Now is full of such insights and they are all conveyed in a direct, honest and gentle way.<BR> For those of you who enjoyed this book and are interested in discovering that there is more aliveness and joy available in life, I also highly recommend Working On Yourself Doesnt Work by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This book is actually the first place where I discovered that there is a difference between who I am and my thoughts about who I am.  Its written in a simple and uncomplicated way by two people who are compassionate and create an opportunity for their readers to have a magical, fun and rich life without changing anything about themselves.
B000065U1N|1.0|A racist, simplistic, patronizing, juvenile and comic-book depiction of the USA's brief involvement in Somalia's civil war. There's no post-Cold-War context, no geopolitical analysis, and no contemplation. In fact, no brains.  Just good guys and bad guys ripping each other apart with bullets and rocket-propelled grenades while screenwriter Ken Nolan and director Ridley Scott assault the audience with cliches for two and a half hours. Don't waste your time on this turkey.
B00000ICD9|4.0|This is the film that I should have written. It is utterly brilliant. I have no idea why I didn't think of this first. The visuals in this film are incredible but prepare yourself for a very, very sad film. It's somber throughout and you may have problems wanting to watch this again simply because of how brutal it is on your emotions. I can stand it. My wife couldn't and refused to watch it again even though she loved it. I would have changed some things in the discussion of God and heaven and hell nevertheless, I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to feel what true love is all about even if they don't have it in their lives.
0380789035|3.0|I won't summarize the book, because that's been done.  Overall, the book was good and I didn't feel like it wasted my time, however it wasn't everything I had hoped for in the novel.<br />The characters were well done, and you felt for them -- that much I enjoyed.  The biggest problem I had with the story was the choppiness in which the characters were introduced.  Without trying to spoil the book, the characters are introduced in obscure ways in that I didn't even really know they were being introduced until they were finally fleshed out as the chapters introduce them by giving their general biography -- sometimes millions of years ago without letting you really know what character is being introduced.<br />However, maybe it was my own problem that I didn't understand this device until later in the book, but it made me a little jaded.<br />Overall, it is a good book and I do recommend it.  Maybe it would be better after the second read.
0679640304|2.0|I have to agree with &quot;Michael&quot; from Australia, although I liked it a bit more than he did, he is basically correct. I think Byatt is a talented writer who can evoke places and people well, however, the amount of unnecessary material is &quot;the emperors new clothes.&quot;  It is not only not necessary but it drags on the story to the point of distraction. Almost all of it has so little to do with the story that you have to wonder if it was a way for the author to show off her considerable skills and scholarship.  That is not a good enough reason to plow through this book.
B00005JKG5|2.0|It's been a while since I had the chance to see this movie again as my wife ordered the DVD.  I didn't like the movie when it first came out and I didn't like it now.  It's mostly because of the lowsy script by Joe Esterhaus.  Jennifer Beals was a so-so actress.  But I thought they would have done better if they had a dancer who could act (i.e. Leslie Caron).  The only thing going for it is the music.  If you like dancing, this is for you.  If you want a spectacular movie, look elsewhere!
0440217563|5.0|Wow! I spent 3 days absolutely inhaling the first 2/3 of this book, and I must say that it is my favorite of the three so far. My cousin has been recommending that I read this series, and I finally got started in November. I really can't get enough. The depth of the story and the historicity is really incredible, but the love story of Jamie and Claire is truly spectacular. Though it saddened me that they were apart for 20 years at first, I quickly got over it and sat in one position until I got to the reunion. Jamie in his 20s was something, but I have to say Jamie in his 40s is obsession-inducing. The trials he went through during the years he was apart from Claire has added dimension to the character that has only made him even more covet-worthy. The story, likewise, is very exciting, almost too exciting! It can get a little stressful, but that just keeps me glued to the pages until whatever fiasco Jamie and Claire find themselves embroiled in is over. I am just lost in this book. If you loved Jamie in the first two, you will fall even more in love with him in Voyager. Boy, wouldn't life be great if there were enough Jamies to go around!
B00000099Y|5.0|this was the first tool album ive bought and by far the best.  i'm normally not a metal guy so i was a little nervous about listening to this but as soon as i heard it, i was amazed with the expert intrumentation and vocals, the complexity, artistry and overall perfection of the musical experience.  The sound itself is unmatched, unique.  At first the lyrics just seemed like a pretext for the amazing melodies but after a few listens, i found that the lyrics are truly biting social criticism, and very well delivered.  This aspect is more prevalent in this record than their others, and it truly makes for excellent listening.  This has been in my tape deck for months now.
0060925000|5.0|Marriages (or divorces, according to Oscar Wilde) may be made in heaven, but as human intervention is undeniably required to negotiate them on earth, matchmaking of near and not so near ones has been a perpetual source of fascination for people from time immemorial. Perhaps it gives them a feeling of playing God to interlink the destinies of two people, probably forever.<br />This universal trait is remarkably well-manifested among the innumerable ayers comprising the social web of Indian society, and the average Indian middle class family offers the greatest scope for illustrating all kinds of hilarious and not-so-funny situations that crop up in the onerous task of choosing a Suitable boy, portrayed in Mr. Seth's delightful novel.<br />One of the principal characters is Mrs. Rupa Mehra, an effusive widow determined to find a good alliance for her youngest daughter Lata. Lata has other plans that include ambitions of a teaching career and an affair with Kabir, a handsome cricketer most unsuitable in Mrs.Mehra's eyes as he is Muslim. <br />The story is set in newly independent India in the early fifties, and intertwines the story of four different families including the Mehras -The Kapoors, the Chatterjis (Both related to the Mehras by marriage) and the Khans. It traces the ups and downs, the hopes and failures, the triumphs and tears of different members of these families. <br />The novel begins with Mrs. Mehra shedding tears of joy over Savita's wedding, and resolving to get Lata to follow her sister's example. Lata is both amused and annoyed by her mother's plans but things take a not so strange turn when she falls in love with the unsuitable Kabir. Kabir is not the only suitor for Lata's hand - Others include Amit Chatterji, a young poet, and Haresh Khanna, a dynamic young man who in the Shoe business. Which of these three would be Lata's choice forms the main thread of the novel.<br />There are several sub-plots involving other characters such as Lata's brotherArun and his wife, the selfish and adulterous Meenakshi, who are a snobbish Indian couple trying hard to keep up with the standards of the British Raj; Savita's father-in-law Mr. Mahesh Kapoor who represents the average freedom-fighter turned politician of the fifties, his wife - the gentle and accommodating Mrs. Mahesh Kapoor and Savita's husband - the unassuming and affectionate Pran, who is somewhat like Teinosuke of `The Makioka Sisters'. <br />Pran's younger brother Maan's infatuation with the courtesan-singer Saeeda Bai and its disastrous consequences is one of the more dramatic subplots. One of Saeeda Bai's patrons, the crass Raja of Marh, is a vivid portrayal of the vulgarity and barbarism of lesser chieftains in early post-independent India.<br />Mr. Mahesh Kapoor`s friendship with the Nawab Sahib of Baitar and the latter's son Firoz's intimate relationship with Maan takes an unexpected turn causing turmoil in both families, and the reconciliation towards the end is one of the most poignant parts of the novel. The mutual understanding between both pairs of friends, especially in the court where the Zamindari bill is challenged (Mr. Mahesh Kapoor being instrumental in proposing the bill and the Nawab Sahib on the opposite side, with Firoz arguing for him) is conveyed beautifully. <br />Amit's younger brother Dipankar who seeks the meaning of life in philosophy and religion and finally settles as a banker, and Maan's urdu teacher Rasheed who strives to improve the lot of the peasants of his village but in the end is subdued and driven to suicide, portray troubled faces of Indian youth.<br />Even the side characters are more than mere props in the background. The Hindustani music concerts by the maestro Ustad Majeed Khan come live to the reader and one can almost hear the raags and the applause. The weekly meetings of the Brahmpur Literary society teeming with self-styled poets provides extremely comical situations. Anybody who has attended a local literary society meeting would immediately recognise a Mr.Naurojee, a Smt.Joshi or even a droll and self-complacent Mr. Makhijani.<br />If the Mehras and Kapoors form the background for the main storyline, one cannot miss the vivacious Chatterjis. The amiable Amit, dreamy and philosophical Dipankar, frivolous Meenakshi and fun-loving Kakoli come across as a crazy but loveable family, that is nevertheless, in the author's words, `a hotbed of sanity'. The ludicrous `Kakoli couplets' are sure to stay with the reader for a long time. The parties hosted by the Chatterjis at their Ballygunge mansion are delightful events that provide ample insight into the frills and thrills of high-society life in the early fifties.<br />Mr.Seth's rich and detailed description transports the reader to shady roads of the posh localities of Brahmpur, gutter-ridden slums in the Brahmpur suburbs, dusty village roads of Rudhia district and even a cemetery in Calcutta where the legendary `Rose Aylmer' lies buried.<br />The political situation in India with emphasis on the changing face of the Congress party soon after Independence, the apprehensions of the landowners before the passing of the Zamindari bill, the communal tension underlining religious processions have all been portrayed in picturesque and emotionally charged scenes.  <br />A reader's only grudge after nearly 1400 pages may be that the book is too short! The way some of the loose ends are tied up towards the end (such as rediscovery of Mr.Mehra's medal) take away some of its authenticity. Though Lata's decision does not come as a surprise to the reader, as it is suggested and built on right from the later half, it creates a feeling that she had chosen the wrong one. Mr. Seth has compromised on the intensity of some characters, and one wishes to know more about many of them, especially Amit and Firoz. <br />An impression of newly independent India (that has not changed much after fifty-two years), an engaging journey along the banks of theflowing Ganges, an insight into the thoughts, emotions and dreams of a group of people caught in filial, social and political ties - `A Suitable Boy ` is much more than a novel - It is a generous (and delectable) slice of Indian life.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Pishposh!  What is all this nonsense I read in the reviews of this movie that say it is not Jane Austen-y enough?  What a bunch of garbledy-gook.  This is a fantastic movie, superbly cast and well written.  True, it is not as high-brow as the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, but it is funny and infinitely more clever.<br />Gwenyth Paltrow is good as Emma.  Her accent is easy to listen to, and her delivery is very natural.  Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightly (SIGH) is splendid.  How any woman could watch this movie and not fall head over heels in love with \\"My Mr. Knightly\\" is beyond believing.<br />If you enjoy fun, clver movies, buy Emma.  If you want something more high-brow and wrought with angst, get Mansfield Park or Pride and Prejudice.

B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Jane Austen's fine novel, Pride and Prejudice, is really quite spectacular.  The casting is splendid.  The actress who plays Elizabeth Bennett's mother is absoultely hilarious.  Her grating manner and voice really add to the character.  Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy....<br />SIGH....<br />Well, thanks for allowing me that moment of digression.  Colin Firth plays a wonderfully proud but intriguing Mr. Darcy.  You find him snobbish in the beginning, but by the middle of the movie you are really rooting for him.<br />As with all BBC productions, the sets and scenery are marvelous.<br />WARNING:  The &quot;bonus&quot; featurette was a bit of a disappointment though.  Not a lot of information about the novel, the author, or the making of this movie.
B000066NW0|2.0|&quot;Let Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne is a CD that is filled with lots of emotion. Although not emotion that is channeled in a good direction for the full length. I thought it started out well with &quot;Losing Grip&quot;. It's a cool angry type of song, but for the most part the CD is depressing and it seems to me that she is trying to hard to be a &quot;bad&quot; type of girl. Talking about how she lives to the extreme and this and that.... Excuse me, you're not even eighteen I believe, you don't even know what life is about. If you say this maybe 5-10 years later, I could get with that, but I know she's been a sheltered girl. Judging by the lyrics of her songs, she goes out of her way to point out things that would tell me this. Okay, I'll get off of all the psychology stuff. This CD is well produced and has a few good tracks, but for the most part it is uninteresting. She should take note of other artists who just go out and sing what they're trying to get across, rather than trying to explain herself through a song. That's what makes her seem so phony. It's an average CD in my opinion. Nothing special at all.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Phillip Glass provides yet another oscar-worthy score here with The Hours.  I truly believe it is the best score since Requiem For A Dream.  Nothing could have fit the film better than the haunting piano solos found on this cd. A MUST for any fan of The Hours.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Yes, it's slow.  Certainly longer than I expected - sort of a 2001 of the human sexual condition.  But overall I enjoyed the movie - the Kubrick style is always fascinating to me.  And the story is very intriguing to me.  I thought maybe Cruise's character was acting a little naive for a bit too long, though.  But the part about the secret society meeting - I think that kind of stuff (and worse) really goes on (and always has) in our upper echelons of society.  I wonder if any women like this movie?

Given that both are handed down from God himself.  Isn't it ironic that Jon and Richie \\"parted ways to do their own thing\\" and then each of them singlehandedly made the BEST ALBUM EVER MADE, completely without the other? Well, that in itself should build on the musically underrated credibility of the band Bon Jovi.  Unfortunately this was the artistic peak (so far!!!!) in their career, as recent albums post \\"Keep the Faith\\" have been played it a little safe.<br />But you want to talk underrated? This will go down as the most underrated album of all time, hands down.  I cry when I think about Richie's potential.  He has so much soul, technique, feel, blood and sweat....<br />Everyone knows this album is an artistic triumph (which Richie regrets his lack of commercialism (???????) ), but just like Jon's Young Guns Masterpiece, this album is SATURATED with epic lyrics to get you through the toughest of tough times and find emotional muscle, and there's many other great things for all the \\"commonpeople\\" out there.  AND there's great diversity throughout.  Highlights are the title track, \\"Father Time,\\" and \\"The Answer\\", and also the single \\"Ballad of Youth\\", though of course the whole thing really is a mega highlight in an otherwise ridiculous music industry. Again, if you consider yourself a lover of music, you BETTER own this album.  <br />Greatness<br />And Richie, for God's sake get your passion back to play guitar and stop dwelling on being radiominded for atleast 2 songs an album.  Is that too much to ask?
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album is a hoot!!  The lyrics are clever, it's very upbeat, and George sounds great.  And maybe I've got a short memory, but I'm not sure his guitar has ever sounded more relaxed and fluid.  <br />In the past, some of his more overtly \\"spiritual\\" songs have often been a bit heavy-handed, but the title tune here, which has spirtual overtones, is really quite lovely.  It's the final tune, and has some \\"sad\\" chanting at the end, which fades out. Yes, knowing that it was George's final song really makes the emotional impact of that song quite strong.  You really miss him at that point.<br />But the nice thing is that even though you know he was dieing when he made this, you hardly ever think about it when listening.  It's just fun.  It may be one of the best Beatle solo albums.  If you enjoyed George's CLOUD NINE or the Traveling Wilbury's, you will like this.  <br />His songs are all well written, but for me a real treat was his cover of an OLD Harold Arlen tune, THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA.
B000055X3U|5.0|This album is truly amazing, along with all of their other work i've heard. It's consistantly good all the way through and its very easy to recognize that all the way through.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Many people have dissed The Offspring for abandoning their punk roots for this \\"blatant\\" middle-of-the-road, radio friendly rock.  I say \\"pooh!\\"  When you look back at a song like \\"Self Esteem\\" from SMASH (which sold even more albums, but wasn't considered as \\"sell-out.\\") you see that Dexter and the boys really have a pretty sharp sense of humor.  Their lyrics may seem angry, but really, they've always put a premium on fun and irony.<br />PRETTY FLY is a hilarious song.  No two ways about it.  GET A JOB is also hysterical.  Even their take on FEELINGS evokes laughter.  SHE'S GOT ISSUES is an amusing companion piece to \\"Self Esteem.\\"  These songs are fun to sing along with.  And to me, that's a pretty great measure of success.  When I hear one of these on the radio, even after all these years, I CRANK it up and sing along!!<br />Other songs, like THE KIDS AREN'T ALRIGHT, are a bit more \\"serious,\\" and they're good too, but we really remember the humor.  <br />And the music ROCKS.  These guys can create some infectious hooks, and they jam pretty hard.  It's a great album!
B00003CXI1|3.0|This movie has gorgeous cinemetography.  The script is light and fluffy, much like the first book of the series (like The Hobbit vs. The Lord of the Rings trilogy).  I found the movie very enjoyable (4 stars).<br />The dvd's were packaged in a cheap, cheezy paper box slipped into an even cheezier paper box (1 star).  The package wasn't sealed...  You have to be careful how you hold the box or the disks can fall out onto the ground.  I only got the movie to add to my collection, and was very disappointed to see it come in such cheap packaging.  ..
0767817710|4.0|Okay, so it's not the greatest movie ever made...or even a great western. What is is, however, is lots of fun, with lots of showy filmmaking. Sam Raimi shows off his craft very well here...and the actors get to really have fun playing archetypes...or maybe spoofs of archetypes.<br />Basically, the movie is about a famous \\"quick draw\\" contest in a dusty little western town with no other apparent reason for existing.  There are LOTS of great contests.<br />Sharon Stone doesn't have to do anything but look cool (and sexy when she's under all those furs). Gene Hackman is virtually the same character he played in UNFORGIVEN, but more one-dimensional...on purpose. DiCaprio is a hoot (try to remember him before you saw TITANIC and he got overexposed...he was really a fun actor). An unknown Russell Crowe is moody and handsome, and one gets just a tiny glimpse of the full-fledged \\"quiet, tortured hero\\" he would become with GLADIATOR. Lance Henrickson is funny, and all the other characters are totally over the top. The plot is so simple and straightforward, yet the movie is a lot of fun. Don't see this movie as an example of a great western...see it if you want to enjoy some great actors having fun with a bit of good-looking fluff. I've seen the movie three times now over the past 6 years...and I enjoy my 95 minutes every time.
0061001783|4.0|This is the first Heyer book I've read--some bookstore clerks insisted I had to try it. In many ways, the book seemed like fake Jane Austen to me, but it was written with so much humor and good will that I ended up really enjoying it. The opening scene is rather tedious, but it's clear sailing once heroine Kitty Charing makes her appearance. Heyer excels at creating memorable and unusual characters, and enjoys playing with her readers' expectations.
B00006L83N|5.0|Last year 3 CDs left me speechless , this one , Peter Gabriel's UP and Tempano &quot;The agony and the ecstasy&quot; , it would be very hard to choose one , but if forced to do so ,Tempano will be my choice, not to be missed , just like this guys , they are doing outstanding music .
0060005424|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Lirael is, at the beginning of the book, a fourteen year old Clayr... or Daughter of the Clayr if you want to get technical. You see, Lirael hasnt yet come into her inheritence the ability to See the future which is pretty much What a Clayr is. She looks diffrent from the other Clayr, AND she cant See. Soon enough she finds herself about to commit suicide when King Touchstone and his Abhorsen Wife Sabriel pay a visit to the Clayrs glacier. To make a long story shory Lirael doesnt kill herself and inedvertantly finds herself walking that lone road of self-discovery. Lucky for her she finds a friend in the Direputable Dog that is reminicent of everyones favorite Cat-that-isnt Mogget.<BR>The second component of Lirael is Prince Sameth, the Abhorsen-in-waiting who fears death and all things dead. To his dismay he too is pushed unto a self-discovery road that leaves him in the end as nothing that he was.<BR>The third and last component of Lirael is Nick Sayre, Sameth's school friend who ends up across the Wall in the Old Kingdom, digging up something best left at rest...<BR>All in all there is war brewing, dead walking, alot of people who arent who you thought they were, and something or someone who was best left forgotten.<BR>Enjoy!
B00005KARK|5.0|Its a timeless classic, you actually think I am going to review it and say something bad? get a grip. :-) Unless you just came from Mars you already know the standard that Disney has adhered too, one of the few product lines that needs not be reviewed.
B000007MVD|5.0|This is a great set of music with The Beatles playing some of their early original songs, plus covering lots of other songs many people have never heard them play.  The sound quality is good, except for a couple of tracks.  It's great to hear them play live without being drowned out by screams from the fans.  The banter in-between songs is also funny and interesting to hear.  This is a great addition to any Beatle collection.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This film has influenced everything from Citizen Kane (the opening shot of Kane's mansion is reference to an almost identical shot in Metropolis) to the Matrix.  The effects in this movie are astonishing for our times and even more astonishing when its 1926 creation date is taken into account.  I saw the KINO release on the big screen at a local theatre and was absolutely amazed.  I've seen most all other releases and cuts.  The KINO release has excellent picture and a soundtrack that actually fits the action on screen (unlike many previous releases.)  Also, it contains the full story making up for loss footage with well written descriptive intertitles.  Previous releases all were forced to alter the story a little to deal with the loss footage.  This is by far the richest fullest plot of Metropolis I've seen.  Good Job KINO International!
B00003CXC6|5.0|I have always loved Kurosawa's Samurai movies.  From Yojimbo to the Samurai Trilogy, from Ran to Seven Samurai.  I think his greatest two movies though are not samurai but more realistic (down to earth) movie dealing with the human mind.  Red Beard is one and Rashomon is the other.  I think Rashomon is a great movie to sit down and watch over and over again just to try and figure out the true answer in the movie.  Yes, yet another movie that Director Kurosawa-san brought out Mifune-san as one of the lead actors, although this was one of the early years.  <br />I beleive that Toshiro Mifune is the greatest actor of all time.  I beleived that he was a compassionate doctor in Red Beard, a very strong Miyamoto Musashi, and even a Noble Makabe Rokuroto in Hidden Fortress.  In Rashomon, I actually beleived he was a little son of a gun thief and lunatic. <BR>Another good, but short role is played by Minoru Chiaki.  It seems that he always gets the same role and always short.  He also stars in a few other movies with Mifune/Kurosawa.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I had only one memory of this band, &quot;she don't use jelly&quot;, the alterna staple from my mtv years..I have avoided this band like the plague as a result.<BR> I was assaulted by every top ten list touting the accesibility of this band and this album, I gave in.<BR> This album is great, try 'In the morning of magicians, or fight test, or Do you realize'.<BR> This is great much like a Grandaddy, or Guided by Voices, or even a Neutral Milk hotel album. 5 stars indeed.
B000068OSK|4.0|No matter how much the White Stripes have progressed, their roots are evident in everything they do. No where else is it more prominent in their debut self titled record. Coming from Detroit &quot;rock city&quot; their blues background bleeds out on this record, which shows evidence that from the beginning Jack White knew what his band was going to be about and where he wanted to go.<br />The whole record is fully of gritty tearing riffs courtesy of rock's coolest guy, Jack White, backed by simple but solid drumming by Meg White. The songs that really stick out to me are ones like &quot;Cannon&quot; and &quot;Astro&quot; which are quite simplistic but are carried to great heights by the passionate guitar playing of Jack and the passion spills over to the listener. There's also a inspired Dylan cover in &quot;One More Cup or Coffee&quot; and a few mid-tempo songs like &quot;Sugar Never Tasted So Good&quot; which signal things to come on their next records.<br />I would hope that fans of the Stripes laste recordings pick this up and if not already into blues oriented music do get into it. I think blues fans would really enjoy the record as Jack's energy really pulls the listener in. Too bad this record was massively passed over at the time of it's initial release but I'm glad the attention they got on their subsequent records got me into them so I could find this very enjoyable record.
0060278269|5.0|This last installment of the Old Kingdom trilogy was certainly worth the wait. I discovered the first book, Sabriel, only a few months ago and just ate that and Lirael up! They were so good and well though out! Not only was the 'magic system' of neocromancer bells, charter spells, and free magic curses understandable and interesting it enhances the already wonderful characters, Lirael, Sabriel, Touchstone, Sam, Mogget, and who can forget? the Disreputable Dog (my personal favorite). This book starts almost exactly where the last book, Lirael, ended. Sam and Lirael have just entered the official Abhorsen house and they have just realized that Lirael is the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, not Sam. However there is a problem from the beginning, Chlorr the Mask has surrounded the house with hundreds of Dead! What will happen? Will they escape? You have to read this fabulous book to find out!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I guess it goes without saying that history is best told by those who lived and participated within it. It's never been more true than in Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe's film of a young journalist who gets sucked into the rock world, much like happened to Crowe in his teenage years. The film is a sentimental treat, even for those who didn't exist in the early '70s when it took place.<br />William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is incredibly youthful looking for his class and soon learns why when he's told he's been skipped ahead a few times. His overprotective single mother (Frances McDormand) has finally driven his sister to leave home, but her one gift to William is the record collection she's been hiding from their mother. William's life is never the same as the likes of Bob Dylan and the Who navigate his life down a new, exciting path.<br />While in high school William sends his writings out to various publications, gaining the attention of legendary critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) of Creem Magazine. He schools William in the art of rock writing and reminds him that they are firstly not cool, secondly are to avoid becoming friends of the rock stars because it will destroy all sincerity of his writing, and lastly to watch out for big time magazines like Rollingstone who will end up editing up his stories. Rollingstone Magazine has taken notice of Mr. Miller and they offer to send him on the road with the band Stillwater if he'll get their story.<br />Here's where all seems to go wrong. William quickly becomes friends of the lead guitarist of Stillwater, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), as well as Russell's mistress of the road, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). The trouble William soon runs into not only trying to get his information and interviews but attempting to balance his journalist duties and his friendships is the bulk of the story and what ends up attaching us not only to William, but Penny and Russell as well. William knows he could make or break Stillwater but doesn't want to alienate the band or his magazine.<br />Every sequence is filled with love, compassion, confusion of youth, and humanity. William is only 15 and he's trying to be this adult he's not ready to be yet. He's trying to make sure he doesn't get used by the band while trying to figure out why Penny can't see she's ultimately being used by Russell. William and Russell's relationship is one based on trust that they know when each is in their professional or friends mode and their actions and words jump around based on who is functioning as what. William and Penny's relationship is just as complex, they confide in each other all the things they can't with Russell and the band.<br />As good as the central actors are, it's the supporting cast that steals the show. McDormand is flat out amazing as the worried mother who constantly is trying to keep track of her son a thousand miles away who she says has been kidnapped by rock stars. Hoffman is every bit the legendary Lester Bangs who is William's sole calming influence and his words are truer than William could have known as he sees all too well his prot&eacute;g&eacute; was suckered by the rock lifestyle.<br />It's apparent Crowe would not have given up his experiences in the rock and roll world as a youngster up for anything. Throughout the film the one thing that everyone, no matter if they're on each other's side or not, can agree on is that music can make a difference and when they're having troubles music is the one thing that can bring them back together.r but doesn't want to alienate the band or his magazine.<br />Every sequence is filled with love, compassion, confusion of youth, and humanity.

0688170528|5.0|From the moment that I picked up this book, I could not put it down.  This was the first book by Jodi Picoult that I have read and I loved it.  It was the first book that I have read in a long time that I was actually emotionally involved in.  <br />The story is about two children, Chris and Emily, who have literally spent their entire lives together when one night, Emily is dead and Chris is alive from what appears to be a botched Double Suicide.  However, things do not add up to the police, and Chris is arrested for murder.<br />The author does a great job of using the past and present to tell this story.  Through the flashbacks, one sees the life that the two children had, and how much Chris and Emily l oved each other.   You also see what good friends the Harte's and the Gold's were to each other, so much that they considered each other extended family.  You see that Chris and Emily were never really separated from each other for more than a few minutes and how their friendship turned into something the parents wanted.<BR>However, with Chris Accused of Murder, the reader begins to see how each person between the two families change.  <br />I would love to go more in depth into the story, but that would give it away for whoever decides to read it.  What I will say is that it is not a happy story.  It is a very, very sad story and when you read it, you will become emotionally involved in the story as I did.
6305508550|5.0|I cried with laughter through the entire movie. I rolled on the floor. It is brilliant. <BR>The fact that I realized that they had just made a movie about my job should have caused me pain. But in a funny way, it helped.<BR>(My favourite line is the &quot;worst day of my life&quot; one at the hynotherapist. You'll see what I mean.)
B00005JKZT|5.0|It is difficult to imagine what Peter Jackson was thinking when he embarked on this project. I am one of the millions of people who have grown up with Lord of the Rings and consider it one of the literary masterpieces of our time. With the Fellowship of the ring, he succeeded in capturing the spirit of the book and introduced the spectacular world of Middle Earth.<br />In this film, Jackson continues to capture the spirit of the trilogy, but ups the ante a considerably. The sheer scale of the battles in this movie, the triumph of capturing Gollum and the depth of the characters and their bond to one another is not lost in the incredible cinematography and effects work in this movie.<br />For book fans, prepare yourself for an excursion from the tale you are used to. Fan sites cover this in more detail than I can here, but suffice to say, there are some large deviations from the original story. Regardless of the changes to the middle of the story, the tale leaves everything where it needs to be for the final movie which we have to wait until December to see.<br />If there is a down side to the movie, I think it is the Arwen story. While it will please those looking for some romance in Tolkiens world, I could have lived without it.<br />Go see it ... see it again and then buy the DVD!
B00005TT77|5.0|When I first heard this collection of Beatles covers, I had to get this album for myself. I am so glad I did. All of these songs, from &quot;Two of Us&quot; to &quot;Revolution&quot; to &quot;Let it Be&quot; are both faithful to the original Beatles, yet have a modern twist all their own, carrying a stamp of the artists who recorded them for this album. I have listened to it over and over again and have not gotten tired of it. Now, I just need to see the movie . . .
6302467861|1.0|This is not the beloved video that many parents may remember watching when they were kids.  This is simply a bunch of cutouts prancing mechanically across the screen.  OK, maybe, for a 2 year old, but pre-readers will not enjoy.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I just got this cd, and it is so cool. When I listen to it, I remember parts of the movie where the song was played. I find myself saying, &quot;The orcs are coming!&quot; It's a wonderful cd!
B00005OAIE|5.0|When I heard &quot;No such thing&quot; this summer, I LOVED the song...probably because it sums up my life to this date. I heard &quot;your body is a wonderland&quot; and wasn't that impressed. However, I bought the CD. <BR>I was impressed. <BR>His voice is reminiscent of Dave Matthews and Micheal Franks. The other songs on this album are really nice to listen to, and that seems to be the point. If you don't like soft rock- don't get it. IF you do...then buy this album. You might be surprised.
B00004YRQA|5.0|What more needs to be said. It works fine, and I haven't had a problem with it. You can store lots of games on it at a time. I suppose you pretty much have to have it if you have a PS2. 'Nuff said.
B0000640VO|5.0|A friend of mine raved about this movie to me for months.  They were in love with this film, so I decided I should rent it to see how it was.<br />I must say I am not a foreign film fan, to say the least, but I am so glad my friend encouraged me to give this one a try!<br />Amélie is simply wonderful; you would have to be of another species to not fall in love with this wonderfully charming film.  After renting this movie and paying the late fees, I've decided to order this movie from amazon.com.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again and truly appreciate.  5 stars for sure.
B000003TA4|5.0|Once every great while, an album comes along that is so amazing, so musical, that you have to stop and say to yourself, wow. This is one of those albums. Nirvana changed rock and roll with this album. Kurt Cobain is one of the greatest songwriters of all time, and this is one of his greatest efforts. Every single song is amazingly written, and sounds incredible. My love for Nirvana started with this album. I love it all so much. Songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Breed, Polly, and Lithium put Cobain in the same league as guys like John Lennon. There really isn't a bad song on this CD. Every single song deserves a 10/10 rating, and my personal favorite is Polly. It's emotional, heartfelt, and truly genius. Breed is really cool, too. It has some awesome lyrics like \\"We can plant a house, we can build a tree, I don't even care, we can have all three.\\" Some people say that's the work of the drugs; I say it's Cobain's musical genius. I highly recommend this Cd to any fan of rock to see where rock music as we know it came from. Nirvana is the real kings of rock and roll, baby.
B00005JLSC|5.0|When I walked into the theatre to see Chicago, I walked in with very high expectations.  I have seen Chicago on Broadway, and I expected this movie to be as great as the musical on Broadway was.  Truthfully, I could not have expected how much I would love this film.  <br />The singing and dancing abilities displayed by the stars of this film (Zeta-Jones, Gere, and Latifah) were staggering.  After starring in Chicago I firmly believe that the name on everybody's lips is going to be Renee Zellweiger.  Before Chicago she was already a well-known actress in Hollywood, but after this performance I predict that she will be one of the actresses in highest demand.<br />All in all myself being a huge fan of Broadway and musical films, I truly found this picture highly enjoyable and exhilarating.  I would recommend this to any fan of musicals (such as Moulin Rouge); you will have the time of your life!

B00006RAKP|5.0|How can you not give this double cd anything less than 5 stars. For the price you pay you cannot find another cd package with this many great songs. I know Sir Elton had a ton of songs that many people love so there is no way you can satisfy everyone. But just look at the songs you are getting here. CD 1 has all of his fantastic 70's hits. There's not one song included here that doesn't belong. I was a teenager back in the seventies and Elton was always on the radio. He had so many hits and each one brings back some great memories from my youth. My all time favorite is Daniel. It stills brings a lump in my throat whenever I hear it. CD 2 has songs from the late 70's thru last year. Again there are just so many wonderful songs here that you simply cannot go wrong in buying this cd. So I don't know why the other reviewers are giving this cd such a low rating. I guess its because you cannot please all of the people some of the time (or is it some of the people all of the time),Oh Well. But with Elton's Greatest Hits 1970-2002 you are getting some of the best songs ever made. And that's a fact!!!!!
B00000DFSK|4.0|One of the greatest bands of the eighties has one of the best albums.  I originally bought this album for th esogn Sunday Bloody Sunday, but after listening to the rest of the album, i realized that U2 is a great band.  Through this album you can see how U2 developed and how their music changed, but their messages have stayed the same.
B00005R23X|4.0|I personally love the story of Dracula but it has been done to death. I give this movie four stars because of the acting and beautiful surroundings, that establish a feel for the era. Of course, the special effects are better then any of the previous Dracula stories, only because this is now and that was then. If you are a fan of Bram Stokers Dracula then this movie is well worth having in your collection.
B000069KIZ|3.0|Karl Bohm's performance of the Brahms Alto Rhapsody with mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig is a very fine one. Equally pleasing is his reading the First Symphony. There's a very satisfying overall balance between firmness and flexibility, and Bohm seems to treat each movement as if it was individually special. Technically, the other symphonies are well played, but they lack the special quality brought to the First. I find the Second intermittently lethargic. Its third movement is somewhat lacking in playful spirit. There's also little that impresses me in Symphonies Three and Four. In particular, a sense of fantasy seems to be missing in the idyllic middle movements of the Third. My favorite sets, all of which I consider superior to Bohm's, are Otto Klemperer's with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Istvan Kertesz's with the Vienna Philharmonic, Bruno Walter's with the Columbia Symphony, Eduard Van Beinum's with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (Sym. #2 and 3 are in mono) and Eugen Jochum's all mono collection with the Berlin Philharmonic in DG's &#34;Originals&#34; format.
B00005JL96|5.0|I have to admit that Disney completely surpised me with this movie.  Though most disney movies carry a message of some sort, I had not expected them to create a movie in which the values were so clearly.  Often humourous, this film explores the strength of the bond that families have and how family means \\"nobody gets left behind or forgotten\\".<br />The movie first introduces Experiment 626, a creature designed with one purpose - to destroy.  After Experiment 626 escapes those who plan to banish him to a desserted astroid, he arranges to be adopted by a little girl, whom quickly names him Stitch.  Lilo lives in Hawaii with her older sister, Nani.  Orphaned since the death of their parents in a car accident, Nani is fighting desperately to keep authoirties from seizing Lilo and placing her with a foster family.  The beauty of this movies is apparent as Stitch begins to learn what family means and Lilo finds the friend she always longed for in her mischievious, destructive new pet.  The theme throughout the movie is that of the Hawaiian word \\"Ohana\\".  \\"Ohana means family and family means nobody gest left behind or forgotten.\\"  <br />As Lilo attempts to 'civilize' Stitch and Nani works to keep the authorites from taking Lilo, this theme becomes more and more apparent.  I found \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" to be a rollercoster of emotions - from the humourous scenes of Lilo teaching Stich to be like Elvis or Lilo and Stich defending the house in a Home Alone style from invading alience, to the heart-breaking scenes as Nani realies she might loose Lilo and tries to find a way to prepare the little girl for going away.  I loved the Hawaiian music and lullaby sung by Nani as she and Lilo rocked in a hammock.<br />This is a movie I will watch again and again!
B00003CY0V|2.0|Once again, I watch a movie with a stellar cast but a mediocre script.  As action movies go, there wasn't enough real action - just a car chase, a foot chase, and the 360-degree explosion scene.  As hacker intrigue movies go, there wasn't enough hacking going on.  As mystery movies go, well, there was hardly any mystery to it at all.  It was an all-around disappointment.<br />John Travolta is malevolent fun as Gabriel, the self-styled antiterrorist.  I always enjoy watching him; he is basically the only reason I'm giving this movie the generous score of 2 stars.  Halle Berry as Ginger, is pure eye candy; not even a hint of her acting talent can be seen here.  Her infamous nude scene is completely gratuitous and unnecessary.  Of course, she does make great eye candy.  The very talented Don Cheadle doesn't really get to do much except act frustrated as the police officer who's trying to figure out what's going on.  And Hugh Jackman as Stanley, one of the world's greatest hackers, is basically eye candy as well - with a little acting thrown in - a complete waste of his venerable acting talent.  And, anyway, since when does a hacker in real life have a gorgeous face, ripped body, porn star ex-wife, and a perfect daughter?  Whatever.<br />I love action movies, I love hacker movies, and I love the entire cast of this movie.  So will someone please tell me why I felt so cheated after watching this?  I was only mildly entertained.  Your best bet is to skip this movie altogether.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have read the books and yes the whole Faramir thing really made me mad, but at the end when he lets Frodo and Sam go I was okay with it. I know there were many other changes in the movie but I actually liked it. I was worried that the movie wasn't going to be as suspenseful since I had read the book and I knew what happened, but there were definately suprises. Overall I think Jackson stayed as true to the story as he possibly could. I mean three hours doesn't even begin to cover all the detail that Tolkien put into his work.
0671027344|4.0|The reason this book works is that Chbosky made Charlie convincing.  He's an awkward kid--very shy, and a real late bloomer.  He doesn't understand how to act naturally in social situations.  His awkwardness underscores how difficult and confusing interactions between teenagers can be.  What do you do when a girl likes you, all your friends think you'd be great together, and you just feel sort of ho-hum about her?  How do you act at your first beer party?  Charlie sure doesn't know, and it is always entertaining to see him make his best efforts to fit in and do the right thing.  A worthwhile read.
6305078181|5.0|Out of all one million Dracula movies, that follow the Bram Stoker Vision, this is the best one. I myself, have always found a little bit of remorse for the old guy and this keeps the dream alive. Frank Langella plays the perfect Dracula, he's very subdued yet very powerful at the same time. This movie doesn't have alot of uneccessary blood and gut sceens yet it tells the story perfectly. The scenes and backdrop are perfect for the time and give the movie an eerie feeling. Being made in the late seventies, this movie has pretty good effects. If you want to pick one movie out of the hundreds that have been done about Bram Stokers Dracula then this one should be the one to pick.
0446520950|4.0|David Baldacci's Total Control careens on a collision course towards a firey conclusion. This fast-paced, modern mystery grips the reader from the first few pages, then refuses to release their attention until the last few. Baldacci keeps the tone taut with suspense and intrigue, allowing his audience to watch both sides of the story - both hero and villain - as they cat-and-mouse their way across the country.<br />The heroine is an attactive attorney whose husband seems to be mixed up in some less than savory activites at the office. This is complicated by the fact that as an attorney, she represents his company, which throws her into a maelstrom of conflicting interests and circumstantial evidence that makes her look guilty. When her husband goes missing, she single-handedly tries to clear his name, then is thrust against her will into trying to clear her own. With no one on her side, she must covertly attempt to crack this case without aid from her employer (who disowns her), her husband (who cannot be found), and the law (who's looking for her).<br />Baldacci balances the tense plot with break-neck action and a believable emotional side. The heroine makes believable mistakes and can act irrationally when her husband's safety is concerned, sometimes even seeming paralyzed with fear and grief, all while attempting to shield her young daughter from the chaos swirling around them. She also accomplishes herioc things without ever seeming man-ish. (There is a pseudo-sexual tension between her and a grizzly old cop that doesn't quite work, but thankfully Baldacci doesn't slum with so many popular authors who would force them to sleep together.)<br />Baldacci shows some flashes of story-telling brilliance here. Though some may argue this book is far from \\"high art\\", it effectively accomplishes its goal: capture Total Control of its audience.

0060920386|5.0|This is one of the great books of business.  Not only is it a great story in its own right, the authors were able to put together the facts of the story in an incredibly lively and detailed way.  They paint this story on a big enough canvas to let a large cast of incredible characters act out their part in this amazing saga.<br />The easy larger than life characters are Ross Johnson, Henry Kravis, George Roberts, Peter Cohen, and maybe even Ted Forstmann, but there are so many more.  There were so many times a deal could have been put together and most likely should have been, but in each instance it slipped away because one ego or another wanted to carve its initials in the bark of what was then the largest deal in history.<br />For those of us who are interested in how business really works, this is one of the epics in business history.  It begins with the founding of the companies involved and the rather amazing story of how Ross Johnson ended up at the helm of RJR Nabisco.  The book also gives plenty of evidence of Wall Streeters seeking out their own interest over their clients' needs and desires and contrary to their own promises and assurances.  You will become convinced of the aptness of Ross Johnson's adage about the rules of behavior on Wall Street: &quot;Never play by the rules, never tell the truth, and never pay in cash&quot;.<br />Another of the many things I enjoyed about this book is that the personalities of the major and secondary characters are given enough room to become more than just stick figures.  There are times you will want to support them, when you will root for them, when you will be appalled by their behavior and ego, and other times you will laugh until your sides hurt.  This isn't a simple story drawn with stick figures.  If you want to understand American business, this is one of the stories you simply have to know.<br />While the movie made from this book is quite good and very funny, it doesn't offer you the full range of characters involved nor the detail of the actual negotiations and how the deal finally came to its strange end.  The movie captures the mood and the essentials of the story and that might be enough for most.  I recommend the movie for those who want the story in broad strokes.  However, if you want to really gain an understanding of how this deal in particular and how business deals in general really come together and fall apart, the book is the way to go.  The people involved become more three dimensional in the book and where some events and characters are left out or compressed in the movie the book has the room to let the story be told more fully.  It isn't that the book is the ultimate truth (I am sure every person involved could point to things they find inadequate in the book), it is that the authors dug hard, got as much of the truth as they could get to and shared it with us in an intelligent, enlightening and often humorous way.<br />This is a great book I would recommend to anyone, but it is a must read for students of business.s involved nor the detail of the actual negotiations and how the deal finally came to its strange end.

B00005A8GY|4.0|my first SACD-- i put this on my new sacd player and the guitar sounded like it was coming out of my Fender SFTR (guitar ampliier),instead of my stereo system-- it was quite astounding. i believe that this technology will improve to the point that it will rival audiophile vinyl recordings for sound reproduction capability--it is very good right now. i must say the live tracks that are bonuses are a let down but the album as a whole is a true classic and this is a very nice sounding disc.
B0000009RX|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life. Only owning 6 Frank Zappa albums(HOT RATS, WAKA/JAWAKA, GRAND WAZOO, WEASELS RIPPED MY FLESH, CHEAP THRILLS, and YOU ARE WHAT YOU IS) I decided I needed another album, cuz he was just so damned tallented. I figured I'd get an early one. So, as you all can tell, I picked up WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. Smartest, funniest, most musically diverse album of the 60s. The very best songs on this record(hate to not name them all) are WHO NEEDS THE FLOWER CORPS?, MOM AND DAD, HARRY YOU'RE A BEAST, ABSOLUTELY FREE,NASAL RETENTIVE CALLIOPE MUSIC(great avantgarde song) and THE CHROME PLATED MEGAPHONE OF DESTINY. Zappa'a best album, the 60's best album, one of my favourite albums, kicks SERGEANT PEPPERS' arse all over teh sweat glands of the counterculture, I cannot stop listening to it. Love it as much as I love Christopher Lowell's show for a good ol' laugh. Oh, and one last thing:<BR>  HEY PUNK, WHERE YOU GOING WITH THAT FLOWER IN YOUR HAND?
B00006RIO7|3.0|As a devout fan of the musical, I was thrilled to see it jump to the big screen so I could see it frequently without shelling out seventy bucks each time (I take that back - I forgot about the price at the concession stands). But I was a bit disappointed in the music.<BR>Thankfully, the music stayed true to the musical and Catherine Zeta-Jones did a wonderful job, but Renee Zellwegger (and as a fan, it pains me to say this) sings every song almost as boringly as a lullaby. It sounds almost as if Roxie has no soul - or needs a curling iron thrust up her backside to wake her from the dead. But her voice is pleasant, if not appropriate. Roxie is a tough cookie, and I don't feel she was conveyed that way.<BR>Richard Gere held his own, but I don't feel his voice matched his character - a smooth-talking lawyer sung by a gritty-voiced actor. But then again, I'm a nit-picker.<BR>Finally, Queen Latifah - HALLELUIAH! She is the best Mama Morton I've heard on any recording. She really gets the jest of her character and lets the world know. <BR>The additional songs on the CD include two wonderful pieces from Danny Elfman, the lost &quot;Class&quot; (which happens to be a personal favorite from the musical but excluded from the film) and two other. . .songs that make my flesh crawl. Enjoy!<BR>Overall, this CD is fine if you're in love with the movie. But if you're only in love with the musical, then you might want to check out the 1998 London cast recording featuring two vixen who really know their stuff.
B000002KFJ|5.0|While most critics tend to lavishly praise Paranoid, its sad that Black Sabbath's 1975 effort Sabotage doesn't get the credit it justly deserves.  The tracks on this masterwork are dark and confrontational, Ozzy's voice is delightfully angst ridden, and Tony Iommi's guitar is trebly and seething.  The sludginess of albums past are not apparent on here.  Tracks like \\"Hole in the Sky,\\" \\"Symptom of the Universe,\\" and \\"The Thrill of It All\\"  definitely showcase the metal mettle that made Sabbath famous, although the latter two tracks really show the band's maturity in the melodic department.  The relatively simple \\"Supertzar\\" is quite haunting and effective with the addition of a chamber choir.  \\"Am I Going Insane\\" is panned by many but still maintains staying power on this album.  The tours-de-force of this album though are definitely \\"Megalomania\\" and \\"The Writ.\\"  These tracks completely show off the more mature song writing skills of Sabbath, and are very evocative and dark.  Enough of my crap though, I could talk about this album for hours. Go out and get ahold of this fine piece of mid-70's metal.
B000002J2B|4.0|To about most of Genesis' fanbase, when Peter Gabriel jumped ship in 1975, the glory days were gone. As soon as Phil Collins stepped up to the mike, any traces of their progressive rock past would fade away. Peter's departure coincided with the beginning of the end of progressive rock's heyday, so if a band like Genesis wanted to stay afloat, they would have to try something different & even more commercial. Strange as it may seem, they were very much progressive after Peter bade farewell, but the theatricality was simply on a smaller level. To really say when Genesis started turning their backs on prog for good, 1977's WIND & WUTHERING is a pretty safe bet & what a way to end that stage of their career.<br /><br />Peter's departure from Genesis was indeed a tumultuous one, causing a rift that would take years to heal. It was that unpleasant goodbye that may have temporarily robbed the band of a certain degree of greatness. WIND & WUTHERING is by no means a terrible album, but seeing as it comes from a transitional stage in Genesis' career, it's very much that in the way of music: still progressive-based, but the commercial philosophy was starting to become more present.<br /><br />Nothing on here equals the panoramic glory of the Gabriel era work, so even the most progressive-sounding songs are a tad scaled down. \\"Eleventh Earl Of Mar\\" & \\"One For The Vine\\" are very much rooted in progressive traditions (war, the Middle Ages, etc.). But the vocabulary that graced Peter's work with Genesis is exchanged for a less hallucinogenic style by keyboardist Tony Banks, guitarist Steve Hackett (on his last album with the group) & bassist (soon-to-be-guitarist) Mike Rutherford. They're great songwriters in their own way & thankfully, don't try to mimic Peter.<br /><br />Rutherford's \\"Your Own Special Way\\" was Genesis' first American chart single & in a small way points toward the polished top 40 material that was in their future. However, don't expect it to be totally sapped of any identity or feeling like your typical AM radio fare. For an early try at creating a song geared for the top 40 format, Genesis succeeds admirably & it's a shame that \\"Your Own Special Way\\" has gone the way of most of the WIND & WUTHERING songs (i.e. little concert exposure & thus near-obscurity)<br /><br />As you can see, while Phil may be the new lead singer, he's not the main songwriter yet. He's only credited on three songs, yet he shows that vocally, he was the best one to take Peter's place (Phil still sounds like him in places) & can indeed do the progressive stuff very well. \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" & \\"Wot Gorilla?\\" were two of the three tracks Phil had a hand in writing & they couldn't be more different. The former is a somber ballad about the news media that hints at the pop-songs-with-progressive-undertones style that would mark ...AND THEN THERE WERE THREE (1978); the latter is a short, spacy excursion into synthesizer heaven that is really nothing to write home about & is simply a pleasant intermission in the action of the album.<br /><br />\\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" is the band's attempt at creating a FOXTROT-inspired epic, but it certainly won't make you forget that classic. Coming from Tony Banks you can always count on a musically-excellent affair, but his lyrics are nothing like on the closing \\"Afterglow\\", which are just some of the best he's ever penned for Genesis. Phil's voice helps give the words a poignant air that is positively inspiring.<br /><br />To show that Genesis still knew how to stick together as a musical unit, there's the medley of \\"Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers...\\" & \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\". The first part is very slow & dreamy as its title appropriately states, but the second part is far more percussive (this was the other song Phil contributed to). I'm sure this would have made a good epic jam on stage & it's a shame that this probably didn't get the proper performance it deserved.<br /><br />WIND & WUTHERING was indeed the end of another era in Genesis' history. Steve Hackett's departure after the tour for this album was the sign that progressive rock's time as a bankable genre was up & Genesis was in need of a fresh approach to stay in the game. They would find it on their next album, but WIND & WUTHERING was still a fond farewell to both Steve & the style that made them famous. Musically, it is definitely among the band's best (as Tony Banks has been keen to say) & while it may not be an epic masterpiece like FOXTROT (1972) or THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY (1974), it's an album that has been kept on the quiet for too long. Someday, when Genesis returns to the road, maybe they'll give these long-neglected songs the airings they deserve.e end of another era in Genesis' history.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Her CD is wonderful.  And for those of you that take exception to her image and impression on young girls, don't look at it. She is not here to parent your children but just entertain them with song. If she is their role model, then you have more important concerns than Christina's clothing or lack thereof.  This is about music!  Just imagine this CD BEFORE the age of music video.  It would STILL get radio play unlike many of her so called peers!  Britney can't carry a note in a bucket and Mandy WHO??? I like that she is confident enough to be and look the way she wants despite the critics.  Her voice is unmatched in the world of teen popdem.  She has something that others don't-staying power.  Keep singing Christina!  Do your thing!
B00005JL78|1.0|What a boring and silly movie. Don't bother.
6302797535|5.0|I just loved this film the first time I saw it.  The oneliners are priceless.

0812505085|5.0|Pirates, mutiny, heroes, swashbuckling- many of the stereotypes of the pirate genre are rooted in this book. Long John Silver, peg legged and patch eyed. \\"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest\\", buried treasure, etc. Most of what we think of being \\"pirately\\" (whether accurate or not) came from this novel. This book really doesn't really need another review, it has been in print for a long time which is testimonial to how good it is. I rate it with Tom Sawyer and The Hobbit as one of the most cherished books of my childhood as it really made me relate with the main character. One of those books that leaves you feeling like you've gone on a journey after you've read it. It is very entertaining and imaginitive
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Before listening to this album, I had been a &quot;casual&quot; Cash fan at best; I was acquainted only with the widely known and easily recognizable classics like &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; and &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; and also with some of his American III covers.  But one listen to &quot;Hurt,&quot; and I was converted.  I had always been a fan of Trent Reznor's original, but Cash's rendition gave new meaning, new depth, new vitality to the song--which all his covers on this album do, some even surpassing the orginals.<br />Cash's illnesses have clearly taken a toll on his voice, as he himself has admitted.  And yet, even though he sounds much older and his voice is shakier and a little raspier, the old strength is still there somehow--the power and conviction of The Man in Black still resonate.  The songs here are full of character, full of passion, performed by a man who has &quot;been there,&quot; who hasn't always had the easiest of times.<br />The opening track, Cash's own &quot;The Man Comes Around,&quot; is a stirring and chilling (in a good way) portrayal of the Apocalypse.  And the image of &quot;the whirlwind in the thorn tree&quot; is simply perfect, so rich in meaning.  I've only recently begun my journey into Cash's music, but I definitely must put this among his very best.<br />&quot;Hurt,&quot; &quot;Hung My Head,&quot; and &quot;In My Life&quot; stand out (at least to me) among the covers.  &quot;In My Life&quot; has a slower, darker, more melancholy feeling than The Beatles original; Cash adds a whole range of emotion and meaning that The Beatles didn't convey, and somehow Cash's seems more appropriate to the lyrics--in any event, I'll never hear the song the same way again.  I've never heard Sting's &quot;Hung My Head,&quot; but the song and its topic seem as though they were tailor-made for Cash.  Had I not known it was a Sting cover, I'd have guessed it was one of Cash's own.  And &quot;Hurt&quot;--absolutely amazing.  Words really can't quite describe this song--the pain and regret that are there, the torment and bewilderment, the loss.  Listening to this song, I'm convinced it is HIS, no matter who wrote it.<br />But there's not a bad, or even remotely bad, track on this album.  Each song is a gem, special in its own way, whether written by Cash or not.  This is music as it should be--deep and personal and meaningful and emotional, not superficial like nearly all of today's rock and pop and much of modern country.  It's the kind of music that you listen to and never forget.  It has a beauty all its own.  It touches you at the core of your being and changes you--in ways you can't quite put your finger on, can't quite describe.  This is the kind of music Johnny Cash makes.  And this is the kind of music that fills American IV.
0446608955|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and she was absolutely right.  I did laugh at points, and as I got towards the end of the book, I couldn't stop crying.  It's really kinda funny if you think about it.  Me, a man who has seen and enjoyed some of the most horrific movies ever made; me, this tough but, I hope, kind guy; getting all weepy over a book.  I even had to grab a dishtowel to wipe away my tears.  As I was finishing this book for the first time, I even closed the door to the room I was in so that I wouldn't be disturbed.  But it's one of the sweetest things I have ever read, and my heart aches for it.  When you think about it, this is the essence of what it means to be human:  The ability to love, and to be loved.  The topics covered in this book were fairly simple, yet instead of being a weakness, that may be its greatest strength.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone.

0521007178|5.0|I've noticed that the negative reviews of the novel are focused on the sexual content instead of the love story that leads to it.<BR>This is a wonderful story of a wealthy woman who finds her life stagnant and her contemporaries unemotional rationalists who excuse true \\"love\\" as utter fantasy and nonsense.  She finds that love IS possible when she starts an affair with a hermit- like poor man who also has a strong distaste and bitterness against the anti-romanticism that floods their society.  Lady Chatterly's husband is a man who is disabled and finds his comfort in rejecting his body and loves his intellectual pursuits.  He is void of any human compassion and is totally blind to his wife's unsatisfaction with him and his life.  He then is crushed when he finds out about his wife's affair and becomes like a frightened child who's mother has abandoned him.  Like many men, his pride blinded him.  He thinks that all MUST agree with his heartless but extremely factual and logical view of life but after all, isn't it obvious things are this way?  Even though his wife disagreed with his views and callousness, she didn't have the heart or the true ability to articulate her disagreements.  When she finds her lover, he has a way of saying what she thinks.  He helps her understand the roots of her heart and allows her to comfortably express all the suppressed feelings deep within.  He is not always \\"romantic\\", to the contrary, many times he is vulgar and extremely blunt.  He is not cautious of someone's feelings, he simply speaks from his heart's experiences and in doing so he found TRUE love in another who fully agreed.  We all should do this and maybe by being more truthful and open to caring we also might find true love instead of dishonest, emotionally distant, controlling, empty, servile, desperate relationships that seem to plague many couples.  D.H. Lawrence has the wonderful ablity to make his characters absolutely COME TO LIFE.  He makes wonderful points about society's coldness and criticizes modern industrialism as being an uncontrollable machine that oppresses romantic ideals that are the true fuel to the human heart.  He attempts to show how being void of emotional needs can create a society that simply pities those who still cling to them.  He also shows us that if you do choose cling to them you just might come across the true loving person you have been invisioning.  I will continue to read Lawrence because he is a wonderful romantic without all the sappyness of modern love stories.  Read this novel is you enjoy an honest and realistic love story.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Admittedly, I bought this disc because I wanted to find out what the big deal was about in other countries. My last experience with Russian pop (Gorky Park) was enough to make me cringe at the thought of ever buying another Russian album. But, I figured the disc was cheap, and there were two cute girls on the cover...how could I go wrong?<br />Boy, did I underestimate my purchase. This is probably one of the best non-compilation CD's I've purchased in years.<br />Right off the bat, the sound is very clean. You can tell that somebody put a lot of work, and a lot of care in to this album. The production work is absolutely top-notch. From there, the lyrics are more interesting than what you'd expect from a pop album, the music itself often borders on techno / house, and their voices are stunning.<br />For better or worse, you can't even tell these girls aren't American on their English tracks, but the inclusion of the Russian tracks was an excellent bonus.<br />Everything about this disc is slick. I can't stress enough what a high quality production this is. I'm reasonably sure anyone who likes pop, dance, or even techno will get something out of this disc.

B000002HEP|4.0|Yeah sure it sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of a lake, but darn it's good!<BR>Josh Homme is an amazing guitarist, his guitar rummbles, roars, squeels and squeeks like nothing I've ever heard (and will shake your entire house). The bass player is good, Homme and him compliment each other very well. The drummer (something Bjork?) has a great style and ranks as one of the best I've ever heard. Then of course there's John Garcia, not particularly good, but not bad enough to take points off the CD(his best stuff is on 'Space Cadet' and 'Demon Cleaner'. <br />The Standout tracks on 'Sky Valley' (stand out songs actually, there are only three tracks) are 'Space Cadet,' 'Demon Cleaner,' 'Odyssey,' and 'White Water.' The lyrics are subpar, from what I can tell their usually about havin' sex, smokin'pot and beatin' people up, but I don't really care, lyrics don't matter too much to me.<br />The only real flaw, as stated before by me and countless others, is the production. The sounds are all seriously muddy, but oh well....<br />I'm not sure ifthis CD is still in print, I bought all the Kyuss CD's my local record store had, and they haven't gotten any new coppies, so I don't know....<BR>But I do know you should go buy any Kyuss CD you can find, you seriously won't regret it.

The way to teach these people from making another Bad Sequel is to not pay to see the next one, because if this is the way they are going to treat the fans of this series then there is no need to help them to make money off of it.
B00006JKOL|3.0|Technically, the remastering is wonderful.  Musically, songs like \\"Black Satin Dancer\\" and \\"Baker Street Muse\\" are insufferably long, unfocused, and full of the instrumental noodling and melodic repetition that I always found to be the most unattractive aspect of the Tull oeuvre. It seemed to work on Thick as a Brick and even on A Passion Play, but never again afterward. As I recall, the original release of this album is when I first thought Ian Anderson was getting a little too full of himself, lyrically and musically.<br />The title track is a good straight-ahead rocker and songs like \\"One White Duck\\" and \\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\" have their compelling moments.  Otherwise, this is lower-tier Tull.<br />\\"March the Mad Scientist\\", \\"Summerday Sands\\", and \\"Pan Dance\\" are delicious bonus tracks.  I could do without the abbreviated live tracks, however.
0060537639|3.0|I encourage anyone interested in the history of world exploration to read 1421 because it contains a nice collection of the information known about the Chinese explorations as well as some very interesting speculation about why the european explorations of the late 15th and early 16th centuries were so successful. The book does a good job of identifying numerous objects, sites, and areas of research whose study could provide answers to the many open questions about the Chinese explorations.<br />The most interesting part of the book, to me, is the speculation on how the Columbus brothers conspired to distort the secret Portuguese maps to convince the Spanish court that the western route to the Orient was shorter than the eastern route being explored by the Portuguese.<br />However, Menzies claims about his discoveries and insights are extremely overblown. He seems to suffer from the same myopia that he accuses europeans of - the facts (rather than America) were not known until he discovered them, no matter how many people were there before him.<br />I tired of hearing about what he discovered, and the only possible conclusion on page after page. Menzies correctly categorizes himself on page 406 when he references those who preceded him in drawing conclusions about he Piri Reis map. Hapgood proved the map was the product of an ancient and unknown civilization and von Daniken proved it had extra-terrestrial origins. There are enough facts, including the Piri Reis map, that Menzies' rampant speculations and claims really aren't necessary. I would prefer to let the professinal historians decide what is proven.<br />1421 includes information that will be new to most readers, but most of the significant facts have been in circulation for some time. His statements to the contrary are as accurate as the 1421 web page statement that &quot;...historical purists have constantly stood their ground in the belief that Columbus was the first to discover America&quot;. Putting aside the aboriginal discoverers, most school children know about the Vikings, and many of us know about some of the others.<br />The several pre-columbian discoveries of the western hemisphere and other parts of the world are interesting curiosities. What sets off Columbus's discoveries from the rest, is that his discovery had important and immediate consequences.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|\\"Men in Black 2\\" is a perfect example of knowing when to call it quits.  While \\"Men and Black\\" was a very amusing and entertaining film, this sequel proves to be just another movie made only with the motive of cashing in more money.  Everything that was in the first film has been recycled into this sequel with very unimpressive results.<br />Once again the world is in danger and it is up to the Men and Black to save it.  Jay (Will Smith) has to bring back Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) out of retirement, for he is possibly the only person with the answers and is the only guy who can help him.  Using the same tired formula and ridiculously forced jokes, the two are back together again ready to face the alien scum of the earth.<br />Now, there are some pros to the movie.  There are some amusing moments and jokes that do tend to get a laugh or two.  The picture quality is great and there are some really cool special effects.  However, there are far more cons than pros.  Tommy Lee Jones is great at being funny through his seriousness, but it is nothing we haven't seen in the first one.  Will Smith seems even more desperate to be the center of attention in this one.  There is hardly any lines that come out of his mouth that isn't a joke or a wisecrack.  I did like Johnny Knoxville's character and thought he didn't do too bad.  However, the rest of the acting in the movie just wasn't there for the most part.  The film also is very short, proving that they couldn't even think of a lot of new things to put in this one.  It's not even an hour and a half if I'm correct.<br />If you've seen the first \\"Men in Black,\\" then you have seen this one.  I loved the first film and I think they should've just left it alone.  Now, they decided to make a new sequel that is nothing more but a forced product to cash in more money from the moviegoers.  This is nothing new, of course, but this one seems a lot more desperate than the rest.  While it is amusing at some points, it's just a tired movie that is running out of punch lines.  It's that unfunny joke that your buddy keeps telling you over and over again with hope that one day you'll finally laugh and find it funny.  Rent this one first if you are curious to see it.at is running out of punch lines.

B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is so cool. Sure it's a strange album from the equally strange Floyd, but it's also very melodic, soothing, and just downright catchy. You will have certain melodies stuck in your head for days after you hear them. I know I can't really be qualified as a Floyd fan much less a fanatic, since after all the only albums I own by them are Ummagumma, The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon and this one. But nonetheless I feel that Atom Heart Mother is right at par with The Wall with Dark Side next and Ummagumma bringing up the rear. This album along with the Wall and Dark Side has gotten me way more interested in the Floyd and has made me want to eagerly buy more of their albums--especially Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Meddle, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Final Cut. I feel that this album should definitely be bought and cherished and you will be thanking yourself forever in doing so. Atom Heart Mother is just great. Period.
B00006JKON|4.0|Bravo to the production and remastering people for making this release a genuine listening pleasure.  Echoing my review of Too Old To Rock & Roll: Too Young To Die, this sounds incredible compared to the original vinyl--and my ears are thirty years older!  Also, revisiting the songs after lo these many years have caused me to re-proclaim Ian Anderson and the group as dazzling composing and performing talents.  The arrangements are tasteful and tuneful.  Are modern young rock performers oblivious to these sensibilities?  Though I must admit, the soprano sax on this album was overdone.  <BR>I wish the bonus track \\"Warchild Waltz\\" wasn't truncated--I was so enjoying it.  It was also good to hear \\"Rainbow Blues\\" again as I had only heard it once before on the radio about the time of its original release.<BR>It's truly amazing how time makes the somewhat lesser work of the best groups sound brilliant in comparison to what's being put out today.

B00005RDSM|5.0|I have to thank Disney for leaving this film uncut.  But I wonder why Disney choose to censor Fantasia and not this film.  They both have racial sterotypes.  Anyway I'm just happy they didn't censor it.  Please release all your films uncut, unedited and unPC.
B000056K04|5.0|DMB has caught a lot of flak from fans for Everyday.  It's been criticized for having too much studio, too little band, too much Ballard, and not enough Lillywhite.<br />As a diehard Dave Matthews Band fan, I had to purchase this album.  On my first listening, I was blown away.  Each and every song had an excitement, as well as a poignancy that affected me greatly.  Dave Matthews is an incredible lyricist - although sometimes it can be hard to understand him - and actually listening to the message in each song should cure any nay-sayer.<br />I could go into detail about each and every track on this album, but here are three highlights:<br />Track 2 - &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is classic DMB with a twist.  Dave's voice soars, while in the background the entire band sounds like they're having a blast.  The ending can be disconcerting, until you realize that it's a statement.  It cuts off, symbolizing that the world has ended.  This was done on purpose, because the band does the same thing at their live performances.<br />Track 9 - &quot;Fool to Think&quot; is absolutely beautiful.  The quick pace represents an urgency and energy in the song that is sometimes lacking in their slower songs.  Put this one on repeat!<br />Track 10 - &quot;Sleep to Dream Her&quot; brings a mellow, starry-eyed note to the album.  It's blue and melancholy, bright and hopeful.  &quot;I know I'll miss her later /  Wish I could bend my love to hate her.&quot;  Sad and lovely.<br />The only criticism is that this album doesn't showcase the talents of the rest of the band as much as previous albums.  Carter Beauford said in a Rolling Stone interview that &quot;Everyday was a Dave Matthews album.&quot;  All the same, it's a great addition to your DMB collection.
B00006JKOM|4.0|This longtime Tull fan finds this remastered edition of what he once considered an overly pretentious endeavor to be a brilliant example of the midlife sensibilities of an aging rocker; probably because the writer of this review is at the same stage in his life and career!<BR>The remastering makes the fine songs come to life more than I could ever remember hearing on vinyl.<BR>I don't know if advancing age and its supposed accompanying stodginess is resposible for this reassessment, or perhaps it's just so hard to find good music on modern-day commercial radio, that what was once considered bland in the '70s shines by comparison.<BR>This is good stuff, Mr. Anderson!
6305538018|5.0|Cronenberg made the thinking person's Matrix with this film. Gotta love the fact that for less money one can make a better movie.

Matrix doesn't come close.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Let me get the one drawback out first...Gary Oldman did as well as he could with how badly his character was written. He did very well, but with another 5 or 10 minutes of character development and story his character, Stansfield, the head antagonist, could have been written 20 times better. But that's not enough to mess up the movie by a long shot! I have totally fallen in love with both Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in this. This movie answers the question of just how deep and warm and human a \\"hitman\\" can be written. The few extra minutes of this so-called \\"International Version\\" makes all the difference, too! We really get a feel for how much pain and how screwed up he has made his life because of one mistake in his past - a mistake that would present a decision difficult for anyone to make. The extreme polar opposite of this adoring younster, portrayed frighteningly well by Ms. Portman, makes him reluctantly take a look at himself, possibly giving him a chance to heal, to pay back an unspoken debt to his past. The places where there is no dialog at all are the most moving. The beauty, pain, and humanity are haunting. Oh, plus there's lots of kick-butt gunplay, too. But that hair! Natalie Portman sports one of the best, most adorable Pageboy Bobs in the universe. Her amazing \\"young Uma Thurman-esque\\" face and voice and acting are amplified 100-fold by the hairstyle that she so unfortnuatly had for only this one movie. If you love Bob haircuts, if you love laughing and crying simultaneously, repeatedely, and even if you love watching hitmen at work, you MUST own this movie!
B000003RCY|5.0|I wish i had more star choices to rate this CD. Rammstein is the best band ever, and not only in Germany but all around the globe, from the North pole to the South. When i first heard them it was like 5 years ago, but anyway, i am not gonna say anything about that time because i feel a little nostalgic when i talk about Europe, goddamn continent how much i miss it. Anyway, who hasn't heard Rammstein, give it a try guys and girls, i assure you, they're the best. In the beginning when i heard DU HAST, i hated the keyboard coz it reminded me a little of European Techno music, but ask me now what i think of it:) Flake is a god in what he does. Hail to RAMMSTEIN people.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I LOVED IT!  Countless others will disagree with my opinion that this movie is a wondeful Star Trek flick, but I don't care.  Anyone who watched the entire seven season run of Star Trek The Next Generation, as well as watching all the \\"TNG\\" movies (Generations, First Contact, Insurrection), should love this movie.  And if you've been reading the Star Trek books that fill in the gaps between movies, you'll love it even more.  To me it's just the next installment in a great television phenomenon and I am very happy with the movie.  If you're a true fan of Star Trek The Next Generation, you won't be disappointed.<br />Plot-wise, it was very clever.  Wesley Crusher was in the movie after all (I had read his scene was cut, but lo and behold he makes an appearance anyway).  So was Guinan.  And, I think I even saw Ro Laren (that Bejoran trouble-maker who defected to the Maquis, remember?) at one point.  I think they should have used Admiral Necheyev (a recurring TNG admiral) instead of Admiral Janeway, although it was a nice homage to Star Trek Voyager having ol' Janeway in there, plus we sort of get to find out in part what has happened to the VOY crew since the ship made it back to Earth.<br />I really don't have any complaints at all.  I didn't see in glaring plot holes.  Every time I think of one, I come up with a reasonable explanation.  My wife wondered why Worf wasn't in Klingon Ambassadorial garb, since the last time we saw him he was still Ambassador to Kro'onos (did I spell that right?).  I explained that since he wasn't on the Klingon homeworld, and he was still in Starfleet, that he should rightly be in Starfleet uniform.  The other Worf-ism was why he was stationed at tactical.  Shouldn't the Enterprise have had a full time tactical officer?  Maybe Picard put Worf there for good ol' times' sake, after all Worf's saved his hide countless times.<br />The end of the movie was bittersweet.  I keep thinking about it.  I think everyone who's heard about the movie already knows that the main bridge crew is split apart in one form or another.  For that reason, any future TNG movies will be interesting.  How will they work in the various characters into one plot since they're no longer on the same ship?  They've sort of dodged the issue cleverly with Worf the last few movies.  But recall in Star Trek VI, they worked Captain Sulu into the film very nicely without too much plot contrivings.  One thing that will be interesting will be to see if anything becomes of B-4.  Will he stay on the Enterprise or be shipped off to Starfleet HQ to be studied and/or have certain memories extracted for posterity's sake?<br />Overall, a very strong movie.  If it's the last one, as the commercials and posters suggest, it's a good one to finish on.  If it's not the last one, there's still many adventures they could have that would make sense, and not leave the viewers wondering when the cast will retire.  After all, they're still quite young compared to the final movie the original series crew was in.  Go see it while it's still on the big screen!already knows that the main bridge crew is split apart in one form or another.  For that reason, any future TNG movies will be interesting.

B000002GFT|5.0|I loved &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;, Fairport Convention's best, when I first heard it in 1970, and it's still one of my all-time favorite rock'n'roll albums.  The album is a coherent combination of a bunch of traditional folk songs and dance tunes with a few orginals.  The band was at their tightest at this point.  Richard Thompson was becoming a great guitarist, just before Sandy Denny, a wonderful singer, left the band.<br />Oddly, as I write (early 2003), only the UK version has two extra bonus tracks on it, which I have not yet heard.
B00005JLRR|2.0|Once upon a time Star Trek movies seemed fresh and exciting.  They could be purely cerebral sci-fi stories like The Motion Picture, intergalactic mystery thrillers like Star Trek VI, or even outright comedy, like Star Trek IV.  They often quoted great works of literature knowledgably, touched upon current events and even featured wry comments on American history ( \\"On Vulcan we have a saying: Only Nixon could go to China.\\")  They were intelligent movies made for an intelligent audience.  They presumed that the audience had read Dickens, Shakespeare, D.H. Lawrence, Arthur Conan Doyle, Melville and others.<br />The rankings of the characters also changed and the introduced new ones.  The movies with the original cast did things which took real risk with the characters.  Kirk was an Admiral for the first four movies, Chekov was not serving on Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II, and Sulu was Captain of Excelsior in Star Trek VI and never set foot on Enterprise.  This is in addition to killing off Spock, blowing up the Enterprise, spending one full feature flying around in a stolen Klingon vessel (until the last scene) and finally retiring the crew.  They did not exist simply to have space battles.  In point of fact some of the movies managed to get by with few or no space battles.  The original series and much of the Next Generation had similar standards of quality.<br />The Next Generation movies, in contrast, have been little more than extended episodes of varying quality.  No new recurring characters have been introduced and you can always count on seeing the original cast back on the bridge.  A great opportuninty for development was lost in Insurrection.  How cool it would have been to have Picard decide to retire on the planet right then and give Riker a field promotion to captain. Nemesis attempts to give us some development, unfortuneately it involves the death of a character at the climax whose potential for resurrection is made extremely obvious.  When Spock died in Star Trek II it was a moment of Tragedy which left me feeling cathartic, as well as extremely excited about Star Trek III which would be released in 2 long years. When a character died in Nemesis I felt like they were just imitating without understanding. I never had any feeling of loss or suspense.  Just a strong sense that I had seen it all before.<br />This may be the worst of the Trek films as it is little more than an extended space battle.  It was made by people who seem to have only seen the previous movies, found themselves most engaged by Star Trek II, and decided to repeat it.  These sequences have become so routine that, with a little more humor, I could compare it to elements of a James Bond movie.<br />In terms of topical discussions, it touches lightly on the theme of Cloning, just with a tad bit more seriousness than Star Wars Episode II.<br />Continuity is effected in terms of the rest of the series which makes me wonder if perhaps the film should be regarded as non-canonical, like the novels and, according to some, Star Trek V and the excellent animated series.  Perhaps in the next movie Picard or Riker or Data will wake up and all of this will have been a bad dream.When Spock died in Star Trek II it was a moment of Tragedy which left me feeling cathartic, as well as extremely excited about Star Trek III which would be released in 2 long years.

I'm such a saddo!!!!)<br />If you like to be spoon-fed your hollywood movies, you'll hate this film. If you thought Minority Report was the most challenging to understand film you ever saw, you'll hate Mulholland Drive. It's not Hollywood drivel.

While this sounds like a cop-out excuse, let me put it more clearly for you: if I think about the music and attempt to put it into words, I find myself on the brink of tears. It's simply that good. <br />The band will be gracing Canada with their rich presence at the end of March 2003 as they embark on their North American tour for Yanqui U.X.O. Do yourself a a favour and pick up this disc to expand your understanding of post-rock. Both albums are absolutely invigorating, but Lift Your Skinny Fists is an indescribable work of brilliance and poignant significance.

I have tried to figure out why this book is popular but cannot find a reason.  It is depressing, parts of it are ridiculous, it is slow moving, and disturbing.  The concept could be interesting in the hands of a more talented writer, but in the hands of this writer it ends up being completely unsatisfying.

Although the story in SA1 is a little more original, we watched it a couple times and that was that. On SA2, though, we will probably keep watching it. Not to mention that we got the soundtrack for SA2 and my wife uses it to practice as a warmup before her solo singing performances.
B00004RFFS|5.0|INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES    (USA - 1994)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / SDDS    INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES is that rarity in modern Hollywood terms: A star-driven blockbuster which uses the theme of eternal life to explore the meaning of existence and the nature of death and grieving. Based on Anne Rice's bestselling 1976 novel (itself written as a response to the death of a beloved child), the movie features two of contemporary Hollywood's most recognizable stars - Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt (both astonishingly beautiful here) - as vampire and willing victim, remaining eternally young as the world changes around them. Cruise plays a seasoned bloodsucker who revels in his own outrageous decadence, and his wilful excesses are roughly contrasted with Pitt's horror at the necessity of consuming human blood, until Cruise is forced to create another 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl (Kirsten Dunst) who subsequently refuses to grow old gracefully, leading to betrayal and tragedy.     Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal (TITUS, FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN), and beautifully designed (by Dante Ferretti, GANGS OF NEW YORK) and photographed (Philippe Rousselot, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT), the film's epic sweep carries its central characters through the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe, where a nest of ancient vampires (led by scene-stealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea) wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore.     But, for all its spectacle, director Neil Jordan (THE COMPANY OF WOLVES) - working from a script credited to Anne Rice herself - allows the story to unfold at a leisurely pace, providing us with a deliberate insight into the monsters at the heart of the story and the catastrophic events which shape their destinies. The film concludes ironically,with a 20th century invention (motion pictures) which allows Pitt to see his 'beloved sunrise' once more (illustrated with clips from the likes of SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS, GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN!), and there's an incredibly moving sequence involving a once-proud vampire laid low by his own vanity.     The mood is somewhat spoiled, however, by a silly trick ending which upsets the delicate balance established during the first half of the film. And, as with the novel, the homoerotic undercurrent is mere window-dressing, an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers (and Rice herself) refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the film is dedicated to the memory of the late and much-lamented River Phoenix who died during pre-production, and his role (as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title) was taken by Christian Slater.     Followed by QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (2002).
B00006ZSAD|4.0|I knew Portisheads trademark DJ-ing and electronic darkness would not be present but then i also knew Gibbons would add her touch to this lp. This is really an immense LP, 'Mojo' magazine said it was one of the best records ever made. The best way to think of how this record sounds is to imagine how Shirley Bassey's band would sound if they made an upto date record with darker influences. Also certain sections of a few tracks sound like they would have fitted perfectly onto a Portishead album, but only Portishead fans who are more experimental and like folk & real instruments will understand this album.<br /> Musically this album is phenomenal. The instruments are well played and arranged, the production is top notch (but maybe a bit to glossy sometimes), but while Gibbons voice is like an instrument, she unfortunatly doesn't exert it enough. Personaly I reckon you should forget the lazy mainstream ramblings from the likes of Norah Jones and co. and indulge into this immense showcase of musical talent. It comes highly recommended to Goldfrapp fans, as does Goldfrapp to Gibbons fans. Also worth checking out is Malcom Middletons debut lp. Think dark and atmospheric accoustic folk sung the world most depressed and lonely man, in a Scottish accent. Truely excellent.

B000002JKA|5.0|When I got this cd about 2 months back, I wasn't really sure what to make of it.  I still liked it, but I was a bit disappointed, because it wasn't quite on the level of their last 2 albums.  However, I've enjoyed this cd more and more each time I've listened to it, and now I'd say it's the second best of the 4 DT albums I own.(It's not as good as SFAM, and better then 6DOIT and I&E, IMO)<br />I think the basis of my disappointment came from everyone on this site talking about how heavy this disc is when compared to their other stuff.  This got me pretty excited about getting this, cause I'd always wanted for DT to be a bit heavier.  In the end, while, yeah, it is their heaviest, it isn't really much heavier than their other stuff.(I think long-time DT fans over-stated the difference, cause this album followed I&W, which is lighter than their last 2 albums.)  The real difference is that it is a lot darker and more somber sounding than their other material, which I do like.  It also lacks a song which goes overboard on the on the wimpiness scale, a la Through Her Eyes or Solitary Shell, which makes this their most consistent work.  Still, even now that I'm over my initial disappointment, I think this album should have been a bit heavier.  The main cause of this problem is the mediocre production.  The guitars are significantly bassier and more distorted than those on their other albums, but they aren't given that much more prominence in the mix.  The drums are also a bit weak, with the prominence of the bass drums fluctuating wildly and inexplicably.  I guess the real issue isn't that this album isn't heavier enough, it's that it is trying to be heavier than the production allows it to be.  So, the band ends up sacrificing some melodicism with out having as significant of an increase in power and aggression as they seemed to want.  In the end, this isn't actually that much of a problem, but it's about the only specific problem this piece has, so I feel I needed to address it.  I should also point out that I don't think most DT fans will care about the production complaints I have, as many seem to think it is too heavy, and no one else seems to think it isn't heavy enough. This is probably because most DT fans seem to be primarily prog-rock fans, who listen to prog-metal as an extension of it. I, however, am primarily a metal fan who listens to prog-metal as an extension of metal.(though I still am interested in prog-rock too) So, I should say that if you are a metal fan who is interested in getting in to DT, this is probably the best place to start, whereas if you are a prog-rock fan you'd probably be better off with SFAM or I&W.<br />But, all that aside, this is an excellent work.  Few 75 minutes cds can be fully compelling from beginning to end.  This one leaves me wishing it were longer.  The musicianship needs no further praise.  It is simply astouding, as always.  This also has the best lyrics they've written, though this isn't much of a prize, as the lyrics on their last two albums have ranged from mediocre to [bad], and the ones I&W were pretty good, if not spectacular.(However, they still have a few painful lines here and there.)  On an album as solid as this, it is hard to pick out stand-out tracks.  The songwriting is a bit more mature than on I&W which was occasionally underfocused and disjointed, though it still isn't quite as fluid and natural as it would become.  Space-Dye Vest is probably my favorite.  The samples are a little jarring at first, but the relatively simple piano work its eerie, distortion ridden support is surprisingly powerful.  Labrie also gives his best vocal performance on the album, as he deftly portrays the barely contained sorrow and rage of the lyrics.(Sadly, Labrie's vocals in general are more uneven than usual.  He lets out some initially unbearable shrieks from time to time, and oversings otherwise fairly often. Still, he is often very good, as on this track, so just give him some time and his strengths will become more apparent and his weaknesses less.)  Caught In a Web is another strong track, with good riffing.  The Mirror and Lie are compelling pair, which at first came across as an epic composition, as they are back to back, and are the 2 darkest, heaviest pieces on the album.(I believe they are performed with a 7-string guitar)  Scarred and Voices also standout, as the 2 espcially epic tracks.  Unlike most people, I prefer Voices.  It isn't as progressive, though it is more complex than most people think, and is never boring.  It's got a great pairing of slow and sorrowful keyboard driven sections combined with some of the heaviest guitar work on the album.(It has another outstanding solo).  It's also simply one of the more emotionally powerful songs found here.  Scarred is still very strong, though it is a little bit disjointed at times, and has a few lyrical problems.  It's got probably the single best guitar solo on the album, which precedes the final vocal section of the track.<br />So, what does this all come done to? Buy this album.d his strengths will become more apparent and his weaknesses less.)  Caught In a Web is another strong track, with good riffing.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I've had the pleasure of seeing AKUS over 5 times live in concert and found that this CD set is a realistic replica of their live performance.  I wish that they would have included a few more of Alison's corny stories so you can sort of get a look into her personality.
B000002VTE|1.0|This is one of the most pointless and boring discs I have ever suffered through.  I am not a stranger to Ambient or Psychedelic music, but this is overhyped ....  For years I have been listening to the worshipful prattle from the so-called \\"Drug Music\\" crew about the genius of Spiritualized. I merely nodded my head in apparent agreement - so as not to offend, and thereby cut off supplies of \\"off-brand\\" Pharmaceuticals. <br />Well, a friend burned me a copy of this disc and handed it to me with all the gravity and reverence of a Moonie - saying that a thorough listen was necessary for my spiritual well-being. I tried - I really really tried, but this is by far thre most boring and pretentious slag I have ever forced myself to listen to.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This film is far and away the finest film of the year.  It is enchanting, breathtaking, awe-inspiring, majestic, and absolutely wonderful.  From the beauty of the cinematography to the excellence of the score, the dramatic and inspiring morals of the theme, the competent acting, and the richness of the poetic dialogue, there isn't a moment of this film that isn't finely done.  I have seen this film twice in the theatre and each time it simply took my breath away.  I felt as if I'd been on a fascinating and spectacular journey for 3 hours.  It is truly an epic accomplishment, and I highly recommend it.<br />I remember seeing The Fellowship of the Ring last year and enjoying it, but not sure if I'd continue to watch further installments.  The Two Towers blows the first one out of the water.  The theme is especially poignant today, given the new conflict between free democracy and totalitarian regimes. <br />Do not wait to see this on DVD, it must be relished on the big screen.
1577311523|5.0|This book cuts to the issues of achieving happiness and inner-peace better than any others. While great wisdom can be found in other books on this subject, one must read between their lines to identify the true dissatisfaction with life that plagues the people of our modern society. The Power of Now, however, directly identifies and addresses this issue within the first 20 pages.<br />The book is short and to the point and the style is very easy to read and understand. The author wastes no time creating lengthy examples and then providing lengthy solutions. He addresses many of our culture's common issues and questions in a 'tough-love' way that direct yet sensitive.<br />If you are truly ready to begin the journey toward spirituality, enlightenment and inner-peace, read this book and you will quickly be on that path.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I just have to put in my two cents. Cell Block Tango/ He had it coming was so fantastic, it literally dragged me back to the movie the next day to see it again and the second time I saw it, it brought tears to my eyes because I, personally, maybe have led a sheltered, battered, life of too much work and not enough fun, but when I see art like that, I get emotional. It may be &quot;unconvincing&quot; to someone who is a lot more sofisticated than me but that number was my favorite and I believe it was the favorite of my friends. The whole movie is such a perfect work of art, I love it, and I am a 50 year old construction worker. I have been to musicals, I have been IN musicals. But I have never seen anything like this musical. Let us say the truth about this movie. Being blown away by a movie is no small thing. This movie will blow you away unless you are brain dead. There is nothing unconvincing about it. You will be convinced. This movie blows away the Matrix, for crying out loud. I am ordering several copies of the sound track for me and my friends.
0553801511|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than its predecessor, and if truth be told, better than the Farseer series.  It's true that this volume consists mostly of character development, with little action (except for an incident involving Fitz).  I found the description of the aftermath of that incident, that is Chade's, the Queen's, and Dutiful's individual reactions to it, to be very moving.  And some family secrets are gradually coming out, too.<br />I can't agree with an earlier review that compared this to Robert Jordan's latest book.  Jordan's is the 10th volume in a series in which lately everything happens at a glacial pace. Hobb's book is the second volume of a trilogy, and if it isn't full of action, it certainly sets the stage for the next book.  If Hobb were Jordan, this book would be followed by another character development book...and another...and so on.  This book does introduce several new characters, but they are vital to the plot, not tangential (like Jordan's).

0151008116|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Pi\\".     I picked it up thinking it was going to be a story about faith, but it seemed to be more of a story about self-discovery and self-reliance rather than on intervention of the Almighty.     Pi did not rely on his multiple faiths to get him through his ordeal. Instead, he relied on his own wits and he did persevere. The inspiring part of the story is that in spite of his survival through self-reliance, he still chose to believe in his multiple faiths.  Magical.     To me, the book was slow to start, but became an engaging read, good for all audiences!

B00004XPP0|5.0|There is no such thing as a better story than the Star Wars saga.  The series is so intricately written that one can watch the movies over and over again and catch things that were missed before.  &quot;Star Wars&quot; is, of course, a classic and set the stage for the other Star Wars films.  &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; is perhaps even better than the first one, and examines the complex relationship between Luke Skywalker, his Jedi training, and Darth Vader, who finally reveals himself to be Luke's father, yet at the same time, his nemesis.  Finally, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; which I saw as a kid in the theater (yeah, I'm old), which is okay, a good way to end the trilogy, yet sets the stage for possible future episodes.  Anyone who likes Star Wars should purchase this trilogy as a boxed set, it is highly entertaining and a great value for the worlds most complex and interesting fiction.

0316666343|3.0|A fresh idea for a book that has a good start and an engaging middle part.  But it goes downhill towards the end.  I think it earned marks more for originality, not the story.  Can I have my money back?

B00004TH83|2.0|It's a shame that one cannot enjoy the album more.  She has a great voice and can incorporate different vocal dynamics without really being as irritating as other belters, but her choice of songs just doesn't have the necessary hooks for most people to want to listen to the album beyond 3 or 4 times.  After that, one just puts the disc back in its case and shelves it somewhere, never to be played again.  <BR>Lara, you should try again with better melodies.  The world deserves to enjoy your great voice.
B0000797IO|1.0|Nothing about any of the characters in this film made me care what happened to any of them or why. Aniston is as flat and two-dimensional as she is in Friends, and her &quot;Texas&quot; accent was halfhearted at best. The only worthwhile acting job in this boring  hour and a half was done by the actor who played Bubba to comic perfection, even though the character's justifications for his actions were a stretch. I sat it out, waiting and waiting for something in this film that lived up to the positive reviews, but came up with nothing. It was nothing about nothing.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This albumn has to be the best Queens recording to date.  They always have something interesting up their sleves and this one is no exception.  Grohl plays a great part in the mix this time around, being back on the drums for him is great.  I love the way that Josh and Nick can bring people in and create a world of chaotic ambiance.  My fave song is &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;  It songs like the soundtrack from some great poem or saga, plus it drew a smile to my face.  A must have for any music fan.
B00005JKED|4.0|I have no problem with Denzel Washington receiving the Oscar for \\"Training Day,\\" because the history of the Academy Awards is filled with winners who were probably being honored for a body of work rather (e.g., John Wayne, Henry Fonda) or making up for an earlier snub (e.g., Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino) than a career best performance (e.g., Yul Brynner, F. Murray Abraham).  All of this is certainly debatable but Washington's performance as Detective Alonzo Harris, the philosophical narcotics detective who is teaching the rules of the street to wannabe detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is certainly a solid characterization.  How memorable you consider it probably has to do with you are a fan of Washington or the genre; for the former, this is a radical departure for the actor that standard in marked contrast to everything he has done to date, but for the latter the most significant different would be that this time the younger cop is being taught by an older cop who happens to be black.<br />The strength of the film is not so much Washington's performance as it is the way both the character of Jake and the audience are put in the perspective of wondering how much of Alonzo's \\"training\\" is legit, and how much is some sort of put-on, ruse, or test for the rookie.  Early on it becomes clear that Jake has no clue as to what is really going on, and neither do we.  Jake is a bit too naïve at the start, especially if he thinks a drug dealer is going to let him refuse an offer to toke up, but no matter how much he knows he would clearly be in over his head before long as Alonzo laws down his personal blend of street justice and economic opportunity.  Screenwriter David Ayer is definitely comfortable in this genre, having deal with undercover cops in both his previous film, \\"The Fast and the Furious,\\" and the upcoming \\"Dark Blue,\\" but there is one thing that I think constitutes a glaring error in the film, which really got in the way of my enjoying the final act.<br />I think that anybody who has watched a moderate amount of cop shows on television or seen their fair share of movies about cops during their jobs, knows what happens to a cop who shoots somebody.  Well, that does not happen in this film.  In fact, one of Alonzo's boasts is that he and his men are protected by their captain from such legal inconveniences.  Of course, if they follow standard procedure then the rest of the film does not happen, so Ayer take what I consider a rather large liberty with the real world because with the multi-million dollar lawsuits waiting around every corner I cannot believe there is a major police force in the country that does not cover its rear ends completely on officer involved shootings, no matter who the victim happens to be.<br />Of course, this might just be me, and you can certainly see this plot element as a speed bump rather than a major roadblock.  When we get to the climax of \\"Training Day\\" the big question is what is going to happen and who is going to be left standing.  In a film like this, given the strong acting performances by both of the main characters, I cannot imagine what more your little heart could desire.that anybody who has watched a moderate amount of cop shows on television or seen their fair share of movies about cops during their jobs, knows what happens to a cop who shoots somebody.

051788710X|5.0|Robert Moss has a way of bringing the magic and mystery of dreaming to a practical level of understanding,giving the dreamer tools for a clear path of action. The steps on catching your dreams and the nine keys to dreaming are basic, concise and refreshingly free of psycobabble. The idea that dreaming is like personal radar into the future is a thrilling possibility! I found the section on Dreaming with the Departed to be particularly helpful and reassuring since those were the dreams I remembered most vividly. We all dream yet the tendancy to dismiss dreams because we don't understand or have time to ponder them is the common reaction. Robert Moss gives the reader a different perspective on using dreaming to empower and enhance life in a way that can be incorporated into the busiest schedule. Conscious Dreaming does not offer a dream dictionary. What it does offer is a roadmap to dreaming made easy with techniques and stories inviting the reader to become an active participant in their own dreams.

B0000787FH|4.0|There's not a whole lot to add to the previously posted reviews. In spite of Columbia's audacious \\"Masterpiece?\\" ad campaign at the time of the original LP's release, Imperial Bedroom is probably worthy of being called a masterpice. If nothing else, it was dramatically different from just about everything else that came out in 1982.<br /><br />The sound quality of the Rhino reissue is perhaps a tad fuller than the Ryko reissue, but the differences are mostly subtle. The extra bonus material mostly serves to illustrate why the \\"alternate\\" versions didn't make the album, though it's great to finally be able to hear the sped-up version of \\"Man out of time\\" that survived as the intro and outro of the album version.<br /><br />Oddly enough, even the expanded liner notes don't reveal too much more than the notes for the Ryko edition, which were already longer than those Costello penned for most of the previous Ryko reissues. Still, if you've got the Ryko reissue of Imperial Bedroom, the new liner notes do make a good case for picking up the Rhino edition.

I'm a lifetime messy, so my apartment being clean for more than a few days is a record.  Thank you, Flylady!
B00005JLS0|5.0|First put on your best British accent. As you read this review, it might seem the review is much better than if you read it with an American accent, which is exactly what happened with \\"Two Weeks Notice.\\" Without Hugh grant, this movie would have been the same old romantic comedy with the always charming Sandra Bullock. Although it would have been better than any J-lo movie, it would not have been half as good as it was. Hugh Grant has an amazing gift that lets him make anyone laugh; maybe it's his sarcasm and his perverted sense of humor; or maybe it's his British accent. He and Bullock had great chemistry and were extremely funny together. Bottom line: Hugh Grant could probably make reading the dictionary funny and perverted; imagine what he could do with Sandra Bullock.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, quite simply, gets everything right.  <br />Everything I loved about the novel is there in this production.  Therefore, if you loved the book you will get to revisit the absurd self-involvement of Mrs. Bennett, the biting wit of Lizzie and the exaggerated snobbery of Miss Bingley.  In addition, this production is expertly cast.  Not one character seemed miscast.  The actors playing Mrs. Bennett, Miss Bingley and Lydia (my favorite character) were a hoot!  And what can one say about Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy?  He is an 18th century hunk who can be both an insufferable snob and a complete gentleman.  This production gives a (handsome) face to the character I envisioned all along.<br />I have watched this production a few times now and I simply cannot find any flaws.  The producers nailed every detail, which makes for a delightful viewing experience.  Elizabeth can cut someone down to size like no one else, and she does it wil great gusto here.  Truly a must-see film!

014028009X|5.0|I never had the slightest interest in reading this book, having snobbily decided it was not worth my time. Had I not suddenly and with no particular reason changed my mind, I would have been the loser.<br />Everybody knows by now that this is the story of a ditzy,30-something young Brit--and that the tale is told in a clever, sometimes side-splitting update of Pride and Prejudice, complete with a haughty but sexy Mister Darcy!! Bridget's outrageously inappropriate mother is the 90s version of Jane Austen's Mrs. Bennett; her horrible sleazoid boss Daniel is a perfect Mister Wickham; and Bridget? Well Bridget stands alone as just about the most enjoyable, funny, and good-hearted character we've seen in a long time.<br />What can I say? This book is such a treat, I intend to buy it for all my heretofore snobby best friends who thought it was beneath their notice. VVG!!!
B00005JL78|2.0|but that's about it.  Some of the effects are really cool to look at, but the mixture of mod-tech with a realtively visually unchanged rest of the world looked off to me.  Also, the story is pretty pedestrian in spite of it's excellent premise.  Underneath all of the fancy gadgets and clever lights is the same old tired mystery that is too easy to figure out. Cruise is neither a great actor nor action hero(although he does display some good pantomime skills)and should start to rethink his carreer choices.  Anyway, it's fun to look at for the first 90 of its' 225 minutes.

0345357116|5.0|Unfinished Tales is some of Tolkien's unpublished writings.  These writings includes the stories of Tour, Turin, Galadriel, the Stewards, Eorl and Rohan, the wizards and other aspects of middle earth.  Christopher Tolkien also provides many footnotes that go into detail about the languages used by Tolkien.  I have read six novels by Tolkien, and consider this to be weakest, but I still gave it five stars.  Unfinished Tales contains information that could not included in the Silmarillion.  Many of the stories add detail to those began in the Silmarillion.<br />If you are considering buying this book, you should know this is not like Tolkien's other books about middle earth.  This is a collection of many stories and legends that do not neccessarily involve each other.  In this work, there is no overall plot.  If you, as I, love Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Silmarillion, then Unfinished Tales provides more information and depth.  If you are looking for a novel about another period in middle earth, then you might be disappointed. Additionally, the second story concerning Turin requires that you have read the Silmarillion.<br />However, this novel gives fans of Tolkien another chance to marvel in his genius and be amazed at his vast creation.  I have just finished reading Unfinished Tales for a third time, and encourage anyone who enjoyed the Silmarillion to buy this book because more likely than not, you will also read it again.

Now as far as I can tell people who only liked Soundgarden are more likely to enjoy this album than people who only liked Rage. It seems that Rage fans just don't enjoy Cornell's voice, which is fair enough (bear in mind there's an exception to every rule and it could be you). This isn't Rage, it isn't as funky or politically motivated, but it isn't Soundgarden either. However, personally I believe that it has a lot more in common with Soundgarden than anything else. That's mostly to do with Cornell's vocals, it kind of puts his stamp on the proceedings.<br />It isn't the best album I've ever heard, it isn't the rock album of the year, but it does have some redeeming features. Now I'm a grunge fan and it's always nice for me to be able to hear something that captures a glimmer of what the music was like back then. That's what this album does. You hear a glimmer of the past, but with a little added funk. Not groundbreaking, but well made rock.<br />Don't listen to the hype (Hell, don't even listen to me), but don't prejudge. It's not one band or the other, but a amalgamation of the two and I for one quite enjoyed it. Give it a listen and make up your own mind. You never know, it might surprise you.
B0000636UN|5.0|&quot;You took the best of me and threw it away, too bad the rest of me still wants you to stay&quot; those are particularly true words from Sheryl, in the title track &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; What I love about this album is that it is so real. Every song demonstrates a raw true emotion we all feel sometimes. I feel that is what attracts the listeners, a sense of relatedness. The second reason this album is one of the best of the year is because it is so complete. I could not find another album out there with a more wide range of songs. There is a ballard, there is a few heavy rock songs, there is a few lyrical gems, a few melodic gems and simply filled with a complete variety of good songs. I own the other three Sheryl albums and I feel that this is the best. This makes her truly a great artist. The previous three cds are all very original and real but it lack the jolt and spark that this album provides. This is clearly a change from the Sheryl that she was, but this is definately a change for the best. This album in one word is perfect.
B00004T9UF|5.0|There's aren't many records around that require as much thought when reviewing as does \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". It seems that most people feel obligated to acknowledge the horrifyingly brutal images that Eminem conveys through this record in their reviews, seeing this as being irresponsible and ultimately taking away from the record. In reviewing the album simply as a work or art, I'd say that it is one of definingly excellent albums to come out in a long time. Not only are Eminem's raping abilities unprecedented, but this record has a great deal of variety, and some solid beats that you can really enjoy over and over again. I do, however, think that this records profanity will have an effect on many of it's listeners. One activist put it best as saying that most of Eminem's audience lacks the sophisication to understand his satire. It's a difficult situation, and I'm not sure where I stand. All I really know is that I love this album, but the fact that my pre-teen cousins listen to it worries me

0345448898|5.0|Having received a recommendation from a Terry Brooks site for this trilogy, I followed it and found this set of books to be excellent.  You travel through many locations, situations, and fantasies while touching on many sujects, which may surprise you.  In the end you are allowed to experience a sensation that each of us have had at some point in our lives.  By doing so your focus is provided with a sense of understanding and melancholy, which cements these books in your mind.  I highly recommed them, but they should be read in order so that you do not lose the ebb and flow.

0375823352|4.0|The Amber Spyglass lacks a certain quality...intrigue maybe?? Unlike the first two books in this series, TAG is relatively easy to follow and nowhere near as fast paced. The plot is simple. Although Pullman does write a great deal about spirituality and Christianity in this book, the topics are more serious (a modern take on Adam and Eve). Also, Mrs. Coulter has much large role in this book than in the previous books. If you didn't like her before, get ready to want to [really not like her]. However, the beginning and middle of the story, as true to The Dark Materials tradition, is execellent. This book will definately change your views on many things in life, science, and religion. The end, however, is weak, bland, and predictable. ... The book was worth the wait and to any young sci-fi or Harry Potter fan, I would recommend that you read The Dark Materials series, starting with The Golden Compass. These books will blow your mind!!

B0000214F0|2.0|...I had always been curious as to what exactly is in Tinto Brass' full \\"uncensored\\" film.<br />Let's just say that I am glad that I didn't pay retail price. Why? First off, this particular version is being been blatently misrepresented by it's distributors [Penthouse Magazine] as \\"the fully unsencorded version\\", which simply isn't true. A five second Google search for \\"Caligula Full Uncut Version\\" will reveal that the movie, as it originally existed, was 160 minutes long. Penthouse has presented us with a 152 minute version and are foisting it off as \\"uncut\\", which is just factually untrue.<br />Not that you are missing much ... six to eight minutes of additional hardcore footage and sadistic torture scenes won't make my life any more complete, and according to the thirty minutes of research I did, that's all one would be missing. Perhaps someday a more complete DVD will be offered, but until then this is the most you can find in the United States.<br />In the end, Caligula is a somewhat disheatening portrayal of sick, debased fantasies masquerading as a period historical epic. The sole reason to see the film at all is the notorious scenes of sex and violence, which are still potent today some 23 years after the movie was released. If you are looking for a perverse slog through the history of Ancient Rome as filtered through the eyes of Bob Guccioni, this disc has your name written all over it.<br />But if you are a casual viewer looking for some jaded, twisted little thrills, Caligula will either deliver the goods to the point of excess, or disappoint you by not being just as graphic and lurid as you may have heard. A college roommate had a VHS tape of the film back in the 1980's and I don't see anything new or more compelling about this version, and the film remains what it was all along -- a curiosity piece for viewers with a taste for the lowest common demoninator of trash currently available on DVD, and this is it.<br />I would prefer to rate it a two and a half star effort, but am rounding down.... Find an outlet chain brave enough to offer it for rental first.lf star effort, but am rounding down.... Find an outlet chain brave enough to offer it for rental first.

B00000J2KT|3.0|I think many critics were too harsh on Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam movie, and still remember it as \\"must see\\" viewing when a high school student. Lee Ermy's drill instructor made our most sadistic phys ed teachers seem like Mr Rogers, and I will never forget the line from the Colonel that \\"Inside every Gook, there's an American trying to get out. We have to hold on to our senses until this \\"Peace Craze\\" passes over.\\" Brilliant stuff and a Must Have for anyones war collection. But I agree with the critics who say that the film is disjointed, composed of set pieces, and really looses a lot of steam after Gomer Pyle and Lee Ermy are written out of the story. Their final confrontation is powerful material for the ages to be sure, but I would have been interested in seeing this tubby misfit turned killer set loose on the VC.<br />But even \\"Charlie\\" doesn't seem to have much to do with the combat footage, which could have been set in any war. I also am not convinced that they are in Southeast Asia even with the palm trees Kubrick had planted to decorate his sets. The soldiers look too comfortable with their layers of clothing on, don't seem exhausted or scared enough, and it actually looks cold during the final shootout scenes. To a certain extent, I have always felt that Kubrick had sort of shot himself in the foot with various aspects of the movie, including the locations but most importantly by how uninteresting the narrative is once Joker gets in-country. There are some nice jabs at US military thinking and propaganda, but it's more like an echo of the preposterous situations from Dr Strangelove than any real new commentary from Kubrick. The American war in Vietnam was insane, barbaric, corrupt and cost lots of people their lives on both sides. Well, so what? What insight would Kubrick like us to take away from his movie, other than the fact that Joker is glad to be alive as the film ends? I'm glad to be alive every day ... you don't have to send me to war to figure that out.<br />Yet I do appreciate the movie for what it offers -- Adam Baldwin's Animal Mother is hilarious and scary at the same time, the scene in the helicopter with the nutzo door gunner bragging about 52 confirmed dead water buffallo is so over the top it is perfect, and one really does get the impression that anyone who has survived sustained combat emerges a changed person, no matter how rational they were beforehand.<br />My real puzzlement, though, comes from the \\"Stanley Kubrick Collection\\" DVD of the film, which he himself authorized to be presented in a full-screen format. The reason behind his decision is understandable, since the majority of home viewers seem to prefer the pan and scan full screen TV image, but I feel kind of cheated, and wish I had read more about just what I would be getting before shelling out the cash for it. I'm sure the trailers and other bonuses on the disc will delight \\"cultist\\" fans of the film, but frankly I wish I had saved myself ten bucks and just gotten a VHS tape. There is a special quality  to watching a DVD film presented in widescreen format that I have never gotten from a VHS and kind of insist that any film I opt to invest in for DVD use be presented in a \\"letterboxed\\" format so I can see the movie in a form closest to what the director had intended.<br />So since it was Kubrick's own decision to chop and reformat the image, one has to kind of live with it I guess. Then again nobody ever said that great artists don't sometimes make bad decisions on how to present their work. Kubrick seems to have shot himself in his foot twice, and the result is a puzzled, disatisfied viewer who feels like someone decided I wasn't smart enough to understand what a widescreen presentation was.

0446310786|5.0|In my English class we are required to read a book every two weeks and post a review of the book on this website. I chose to read this book because of all the positive feelings expressed from previous readers when I asked them of their opinion. <br />This book is set in the 1930's in a small town in Maycomb County, located in the south. The novel shows how white supremacy still lived on, even many years after slavery was abolished, and this novel shows the persistent prejudice shared in the southern morals of this time. Harper Lee has portrayed a common way of thinking of the southerners who are unable to accept that the blacks have been unchained from slavery. The whites find it hard to consider themselves equal to the blacks. This theme has been shown through the lifestyles of the blacks and their struggles they experience from the white community.<br />The main characters in the novel are Atticus Finch, he is a respected Lawyer of Maycomb County. He seems to believe in and does everything in his power to keep justice alive. He has two children, Scout and Jem. Another character of the novel is Arthur Radley, a rather subdued man who tried his best not to have any kind of relationship with anyone of the community, he never steps foot outside of his house. Although you get the feeling that he does not want to remain distant from people by the way he acts with the children (Scout and Jem). Bob Ewell is an absolute evil character who has no touch with responsible behavior. He has no care for himself, his money or his children.<BR> <BR>I would have to say the protagonist of this novel is Atticus Finch, he is the key character who directs many events that take place in the novel. Like his positive involvement with the poor whites and the underprivileged blacks of the community. He comes across to me as an understanding person who wishes for his children to grow up with a broad outlook on life and a liberal way of thinking. I particularly like this characteristic becauseI believe that is how every child should be brought up. The Antagonist of this novel is defiantly Bob Ewell. In the beginning you just think of him as a lazy drunk, who has no care for others. But by the end of the novel you come to feel nothing but total hatred for him because of his attempts to harm Atticus's children and how he doesn't even think twice before sending an innocent person to the gallows. <BR> <BR>I usually don't like novels based on that time period in history after the abolition movements. But this novel had a meaning much deeper than just the struggles between the white's and the black's, it illustrated the idea of how the human race thinks and deals with social issues and different morals and beliefs. The novel also had a light and humorous mood at times, like when it connects Jems brotherly manner or Scouts spontaneous actions. <BR> <BR>There's no doubt that this book is a classic. It was a time well spent you can not fully consider yourself an American before you read this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read and liked \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\".
0783114893|5.0|My husband and I first saw this in 1986 when we were newlyweds. It scared me half to death! Rutger has such charm and charisma, but then his character is so terrifying because you soon learn that there are no limits to what he will do. Nothing is sacred to him. Therefore, he is definitely not a predictable villain. C. Thomas Howell is very convincing in his role as outraged victim. This movie has always been under-rated and merits much more attention. To those of you who say that Rutger is a <br />\\"One Hit Wonder\\", I have two words...\\"Lady Hawke.\\"  He has also made many fine movies and won many awards in his homeland of Holland. Any movie with Rutger is worth watching at least once, but this one is worth watching over and over!
B00000099Y|5.0|Things are quite simple. You are one of the following guys:    1) You listen to Aenima, you like it but don't really get it. You like the music, but you don't get in trouble memorizing the lyrics. Alternately, you do memorize the lyrics but you don't really get them and you don't bother further. You prefer listening to the cd once in a month because there is good music in there and furthermore, a great drummer playing. Do me (and Tool) a favor: If you're the kind of person who don't really cares about lyrics with deep meanings and who likes albums which grow fast on them, stay away from Aenima.    2) You listen to Aenima. After a while you realize there's pretty good music in there and you start talking to your friends about Tool. You take a look at the lyrics, you think you like them. You are being astonished by Tool's artworks and videoclips. Tool is becoming one of your favorite bands but, you STILL believe that Lateralus is better than Aenima. Sorry, you didn't get it.    3) You listen to Aenima. After several months of close listening and deep speculation you realize that this is the greatest Rock/Metal record ever recorded and that this will be your No.1 favourite cd for ever. No matter other future Tool (or other bands') releases.    I am the guy No.3    If you do listen to the record and you don't like it at all (which means you are neither guy 1 nor 2 nor 3), then sorry, you don't get it all. Go listen to Madonna instead.     If you are a true music lover I guarantee you gonna like Aenima, but very few of you gonna be guys No.3. But if you do, then you life's gonna change...

6305127638|5.0|First Contact is the \\"event\\" motion picture highlight of the Star Trek series. After so many films and so many years, the series finally achieves the lauded standards that could rival and even surpass other big-screen sci-fi adventures. What we have here is a mostly terrific and exciting adventure, filled with superior special effects and an engaging, complex plot to boot. <br />First Contact wastes no time getting into the thick of action. A borg ship (shaped like a cube and incredibly massive in size) is heading toward Earth and an all-out space battle ensues, with the Enterprise-E at the helm. With Captain Jean-Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) intimate knowledge of this cyborg race, the fleet destroys the ship, but a small pod is jettisoned, which then travels back in time and alters the course of human history, where Earth in the future will be completely inhabited by the Borg. Determined to prevent this nightmarish future from taking place, the Enterprise-E enters the time rip and must battle the Borg in the year 2063, the dawn of interstellar space travel. <br />The question for non Trek-fans is whether they'll like the movie. My advice is to watch a few of the Borg episodes and catch up on the previous film to get a feel for all the characters. Otherwise, they'll probably be baffled by the large cast and all the in-house references. But for everyone else, First Contact will play as first-rate escapist entertainment, a sci-fi thrill ride packed with action, suspense, humor, and even genuinely touching drama.<br />First and foremost, part of what makes the suspense so palpable is because the crew is facing the Borg, undeniably the best villains of the entire Star Trek canon. For those who know next to nothing about this alien race, they exist by assimilating other species into a collective whole, a hive if you will. They show and feel no fear, and that lack of expression can be quite creepy. As far as their appearances go, it's basically organic flesh with lots of cybernetic and machine parts grafted on. I'm not sure how the assimilation process works, but I'd suspect it's not too dissimilar from a virulent attack.<br />It's arguable that First Contact is the most consistently exciting Trek film to date. This one works as a pure thriller, with several standout action setpieces. Getting things off to a rollicking start is the fast-paced and tense opening space battle, complete with dozens of Starfleet ships attacking the giant Borg cube. Later encounters with the Borg on board the Enterprise (they're assimilating the ship deck-by-deck) are exciting and even a little frightening. You even get to see Data (the android) crushing the Borg with his bare hands, a physical display that he doesn't show too often. The film's best and most suspenseful sequence is the zero-g battle set on the hull of the ship.<br />First Contact is not without its problems. Easily the most significant flaw of the film are the scenes set on Earth. While vital plot-wise, these moments serve to interrupt the tense action on board the Enterprise. Thankfully, these parts only represent a minor portion of the film. Another problem, for me at least, is that Star Trek was often at its best when the crew set courses for alien planets or star systems. Virtually all of First Contact is set within a short distance to Earth, so that sense of awe and adventure is a bit lacking.<br />Then there's the climax, which is suspenseful and exciting, but it's a little abrupt and might come as a deus ex machina to some viewers. For those who want their space adventures to end with a huge bang, the twenty-five minute space battle finale to Star Trek: Nemesis might be more up their alley. One of the biggest flaws of Nemesis was that it was often too talky, and there's also a lot of talk going on in First Contact. The difference is that, here, the dialogue accentuates and even heightens the suspense, as we're always made aware of the stakes and dangers on-hand. <br />Acting-wise, First Contact is unsurprisingly solid. considering the cast has been in these roles for years. Patrick Stewart is the best here, delivering a riveting, power-house performance. The scene where he argues why the Enterprise should stay and fight as opposed to fleeing is simply the best piece of acting in the entire series, period. Brent Spiner is excellent as Data, a role he's fitted so comfortably in, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part. The other most significant role belongs to Alfre Woodard as a tough, 21st century woman who finds herself lost on board the Enterprise. The writers cleverly make her both an engaging character and an effective device for which to explain more confusing plot-points (to non-Trek fans, that is) and Trek history.<br />Directed by Jonathan Frakes (who also plays the part of Commander Riker), the man displays a supremely confident hand behind the camera. Visually, this one breaks the mold from its predecessors. The atmosphere and lighting are darker, and there's even an improved uniform change for the entire crew (obviously done only for aesthetic purposes, but who's complaining?). Too bad success wouldn't be repeated with the gag-inducing Star Trek: Insurrection. The Next Generation films have overall been successful from a quality filmmaking point-of-view. And without a doubt, First Contact represents a pinnacle for this often innovative franchise.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B000001DTM|5.0|1991 surely is a landmark year for rock music. Along with 1967 and 1973 it saw releases of one great album after another. According to me this is not only the year's best but also one of the greatest albums of all time. It is at the same time a pop record and also a rock record. 'Landmark' or 'Pathbreaking' are just some words those does not quite say it all about the importance of this album.<br />Among the serious U2 fans 'Joshua tree' may be the most tresured album, but consider the everybody under the Sun, 'Achtung baby' will come out as THE favourite. Not surprising for an album having 12 great songs. I really cannot show you one track which is even mediocre. All the songs are great. Now only if you ask me to choose best among greats. I will have to tell you it is possibly 'So cruel' where Bono sings like an angel. This song always send me shivers through the spine. 'Ultraviolet(Light my way)' will come a close second. It has one the best vocal effort effort by Bono in his career.<br />... And then there are 10 more songs and all of them are so good that I can't decide which will be the 3rd best song. That speaks for sheer consistency U2 achieved with this album. One of the few albums I can listen 24 times a day. I really think The best of U2 1990-2000 should have been a double album with 'Achtung Baby' as Disc 1. So if you still do not have it, don't waste time reading reviews. Get IT. You just cannot not-buy it.

B000002L68|5.0|It's easy to forget how phenomenal this album is, released almost 20 years ago, Purple Rain stayed at #1 on the charts for over 26 weeks...yet, after a first listen to the blistering &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;Take Me With U&quot;, then switching gears on the sweet soul of &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; and &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; we are quickly transported into Prince's world of dualities: love and lust, male and female, black and white, and the passionate and the sacrid. <BR>The man can do it all-- multi-instrumentalist, singer, dancer, composer-- and for many fans, Purple Rain was the first of many windows into Prince's musical microcosm. <BR>It's not your everyday soundtrack whereupon a group of artists put together a handful of promotional songs. The music, Prince and his band the Revolution, his battle of bands with the Time, and his love interest Appollonia, are the movie. <BR>Not one to miss, Prince's future-funk sounds as fresh today as it did in 1984, but beware:  the CD should have a &quot;Purple Advisory&quot; sticker...after a few listens, you may never be the same.

B000006NPY|4.0|I remember anticipating this album prior to it's release, and then buying it the same day it hit the stores. When I gave it a listen for the first time I was not dissapointed at all. Despite the negative reviews by critics, and so called fans of the band, the album was worth the buy. While it is not their best album, it was still a good album for true fans to own, and if you are just discovering the band now, it's still a good album to buy as well. True artist aren't afraid to move on and do something different, and true fans, like myself, were able to do the same and listen to the album with an un-biased ear. I also enjoyed listening to this album while driving long distances across the country . . .which I think is another sign that an album is good. :)
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is a wonderful story of love, hardships, and friendship. This is the best western of all time. I just love old Gus's take on life. I really hope that you will take the time to watch this wonderful moive!
0805062971|5.0|I just read the book for the first time.  The movie is better organized, but of course the book is richer, more textured.  There is not really anything new per se, although there are additional subplots and new scences.  The book would be mondo confusing for anyone who has not seen the movie.  There were entire scenes I could better appreciate having seen the movie.<br />The book is an easy read, but that does not mean it's easy to follow.  The food-service guerrilla terrorism was rather gross, but I appreciated seeing that he blackmailed several businesses into subsidizing Fight Club.<br />All in all, enjoy it!
B000056K04|3.0|A previous reviewer said that they were upset that track 2 seemed to end in a weird way and thought it was a manufacturing defect. It's not. I saw the DMB live and they played that song and they ended it the same way they do on the album, which was actually pretty cool. It's not an error, just a creative ending.<br />Overall this album was too electric and the violin and saxophone players don't do enough. I personally think they should go back to Lillywhite and leave Glen Ballard behind. The album has some really good tunes, but it's too comercial.

B00000JA9Z|4.0|For those who like me just love the 70's hard rock period, WARHORSE is one of those second base bands worth knowing.<BR>If you're a lil bit into DEEP PURPLE's history, you'll know that WARHORSE was formed around NICK SIMPER after he left DP late 1969.It is impossible not to make a comparaison between the two bands, not only because of Simper's presence but also because of the type of music, the same type of line-up(lead singer, lead guitarist, Hammond keyboardist, bass and drums) and the similarity between the lead singers(hard, powerful, warm and screamy).<BR>Of course WARHORSE never released tracks as powerfull as SPEED KING or HIGHWAY STAR but went for songs like BIRD HAS FLOWN, WHY DIDN'T ROSEMARY and definitely WRING THAT NECK(this incredibly groovy bass line is re-used on more than one occasion on both albums) from DP's Mark I.<BR>Both WARHORSE 's albums are very good but remain in the shadow of the giant Purple for both quality of the compositions and musicians skills.<BR>Hard Rythm and blues, long guitar and keyboards solos, solid bass lines, WARHORSE proposes excellent 70's tunes.<BR>This CD features some LIVE versions which I would be curious to hear but unfortunatelly they don't appear on the edition I own, also this CD is not a Best of...it is RED SEA , their second and last release.<BR>Too bad WARHORSE only made two records, I'm sure that with a little bit of perseverence they could have been a serious rival to Uriah Heep.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is one of those rare films that is light-hearted, easy to watch, funny and yet still has an intelligent plot. It's actually about 2 boys: 12 year old Marcus who is wise beyond his years and 38 year old Will who is immature and shallow. Through their gradually developing friendship they both learn from the other how to act their own age. What makes it so watchable, I think, is that the characters are both comic and fully developed. Will believes he is an island, totally self-reliant, an attitude probably stemming a lot from natural laziness but also from his relationship with his late tormented father. Marcus is miserable from being bullied at school and haunted by images of his mother's attempted suicide, but he remains throughout a kid. What's more, he acts like a real kid - he's not cute, he swears, and he doesn't show much gratitude. The acting is without exception outstanding; my favourite was Toni Collette as Marcus' strong yet vunerable mother Fiona. One of the best scenes is when she storms into the restaurant where Will is sitting, loudly accuses him of abusing her son, and then when she realises she's got the wrong end of the stick tells him he's selfish because he's promised not to see Marcus any more. You can't help but pity Will in the face of such irrationality, and Collette pulls it off wonderfully. <br />Other reviewers have complained about both the predictability of the plot and the ending, which is a significant change from the book. About the former, I can see where they are coming from but I personally don't agree. A Will/Fiona romance would have been predictable, but Will and Rachel is more realistic and also an important part of Will's character development. In addition, the general atmosphere of the film is so fresh that a little predictability wouldn't have done much damage anyway. About the latter (ie the ending), its a matter of taste, but I can't see how the book ending would have worked on screen. I think that the book ending is bestfor the book, and the film ending best for the film. <br />The deleted scenes are definitely worth watching if you like the film. There are only a few of them, but they are substantial and very funny, and I  can't see why any of them were taken out. In particular, I think the inclusion of the last one would have improved the ending, but then again the Weitz brothers know what they're doing.<br />Finally the soundtrack is great. Badly Drawn Boy rocks, much like this film.
0679745653|5.0|Truman Capote is the master of both description and character development.  Holly Golightly comes alive in dialogue.  This is a breezy read, in the best possible sense of the term.  It never bores and brims with poetic description, rich in detail, but never dense or plodding.  The three short stories are similar in skill and beauty, but entirely different in tone, location, and plot.  I almost cried at the end of A Christmas Memory.  The Diamond Guitar reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption in atmosphere, but with an entirely different story.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I am so bummed Strummer passed 3 months before the induction and Clash reunion at the R&R Hall of Fame. So tragic, I feel honored that I was able to see him perform and meet him at a Tower Records last year....<br />Don't acknowledge Weiner's review below. He has also reviewed Luther Vandross and gave a Chicago album 3 stars. I guess its easy to see why he critiques Strummer's voice. <br />No album (other than Exile on Main St.)has ever so seamlessly combined this many styles of music without a hitch. Strummer's voice is not pretty, but neither is Dylan's, or Jagger's for that matter. In my opinion Strummer's growl, combined with Mick Jones' harmonies, provides some unbelievable vocals, and the passion can't be matched. It's a shame only 2 or 3 of these songs(Train in Vain, London Calling, Rudie Can't Fail) is known by the masses. Do society a favor and play this album for everyone you know. R.I.P. Joe...Elevator, Going Up!
B00007E8V4|5.0|WOW! This CD amazed me from the first time I listened to it til now. Everyone knew System Of A Down was good but this CD shows how they're kick ..! This CD is all the songs we wanted to know about but just never got to listen to them. This CD I had to buy right when it came out. All the songs are the best they can be. Everyone should own this CD in their arsenal!

0800141660|3.0|All you have to do is look at the cover of this DVD to realize that this movie was made to appeal to women, but after having seen it, I doubt that even the most amorous woman would find this movie appealing.  <br />Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet play two sisters named Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.  Both are bachelorettes whose father has recently died and left them virtually impoverished, and who seem to want nothing more than to get married.  The movie is set in 19th century England, and given the customs in those days, I suppose it was acceptable for marriage to be a woman's only aspiration in life.  Of course, marriage in that day-in-age was more of a merging of two people of similar social and economic stature than a solidification of love.  Elinor (Thompson) is the \\"sensible\\" and conservative sister who comes off as comically prudish, and Marianne (Winslet) is younger and starry-eyed.  Marianne is courted by two gentlemen, and Elinor is courted by a man named Edward Ferrars (played by Hugh Grant), who is actually engaged to someone else, and has been for five years.  The only real suspense is in who will marry whom in the end.  Without giving away the ending, I'll only say that I was disappointed that both sisters married men who were not deserving of women of their high class.<br />This movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and I can see why.  It's visually attractive, the costumes are very interesting, the dialogue is extremely smart, and the performances by Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are very good.  However, even when you put all those things together into one movie, it's still entirely possible that the audience will not be entertained.  This movie was entertaining for the most part, but there were times when it felt extremely dry, and I found myself looking at my watch to see how much time had passed.<br />This is a movie that might be fun to see once, but I don't recommend spending money and actually buying it.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This CD is what got me started listening to Maiden. After downloading four songs off the album, I had to go out and purchase it. The whole CD has wonderfully written songs, excellent guitar work, and wonderful vocals. This CD has passed the test of time, and still remains one of my favorite albums of any group.
B00004U1F8|3.0|Well Ghostbusters II didn't quite live up to part one but what sequal does? I really liked Ghostbuster's but had never seen part too and it was really a let down.  Part one deserves more than 3 stars but part two really drug it down.
B000003S0D|5.0|I first heard this CD some years ago on a jazz station, in a program dealing with avant-garde, jazz-rock fusion, and art rock.  It shows definite signs of jazz's influence.  Gordon Haskell is in top form here, and it's a pity that he didn't stay with them.  &quot;Cirkus&quot; is a true gem, with a sax solo reminicient of Paul Desmond.  &quot;Indoor Games&quot; is the odd duck here, but it shows that Fripp and Sinfeld have a sense of humor.  &quot;Happy Family&quot; is the ultimate nightmare come to life.  &quot;Lady Of The Dancing Water&quot; is Crimson at it's most seminal.  The title song is multifaceted.  'Prince Rupert Awakes' features Yes's Jon Anderson.  It sounds like it should be in an opera.  'The Peacock's Tale' has some down and dirty improvising here!  'The Battle Of Glass Tears' shows many moods.  The song ends oddly with 'Big Top' spinning into space.  I'd say ths is Crimson's best!
B0000797IO|4.0|This movie was well acted with great characters. The movie isn't quite original in the fact that thses people are so ordinary..which makes it good. You should realize that these characters being the typical run of the mill makes it more believable. This story could happen to anyone in that situation. In the ways it could be better are that there are certain scenes in the movie that seem out of place or don't quite make sense. The ending is quite predictable..to break the stereotpye the ending should have been completely different.
B00003CXAA|5.0|NO MOVIE IS BETTER THEY CHANGED MY SORRY LIFE
B000007MVL|5.0|The follow-up to her stunning debut, &quot;Lionheart&quot; already shows Bush experimenting winningly with the basic template of bass, piano, drums and voice that informed all of her debut.<br />&quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; opens with a lushness of orchestration generally not found on her first album, though thematically (as yet another romantic expatiation on love) it's entirely familiar territory.  Simple in its aspirations, the song is exceptionally dapper in sound and makes for a very promising opening to the album.<br />&quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot;, though, immediately whisks us off to another world in a way no Bush song ever has.  Still just a piano and bass piece, the minor key of the vocals and accompaniment create a very striking atmosphere, while the chorus itself shows much more sophistication of orchestration and composition than previously.  Quite splendid.<br />&quot;Wow&quot; opens with a mildly eerie wash of keyboards as Bush's vocals emerge like a face coming into footlights out of darkness.  The particular combination of acoustic guitar and piano here is especially nice as a prelude to the big vocal burst of the chorus, the lyrics of which are simply &quot;wow wow wow wow wow wow wow ... unbelievable,&quot; which amply sums up my reaction to the song as well.<br />&quot;Don't Push your Foot on the Heart Brake&quot; is a minor epic, packing quite a bit into its mere 3 minutes.  It also happens to be Bush's most successful foray into a full rock orchestration so far, with its combination of articulated piano and acoustic guitar moodiness and driving guitars in the chorus.<br />&quot;Oh England my Lionheart&quot; is the album's showstopper.  Basically an unaccompanied piano ballad (admittedly with backing vocals and a number of sonic flourishes), the melody is especially beautiful and sung with such soulfulness that it's almost enough to make anyone into an English patriot, even as Bush manages to slip every sentimental British cliche into the lyrics.<br />&quot;Fullhouse&quot;, another impressively orchestrated piece much like &quot;Don't Put your Foot on the Heart Brake&quot;, moves from acoustic to electric moods and back again.  One of the abiding pleasures of the song, however, is the decidedly unusual bass line of the verse, which continuously thwarts the ear's expectations while still perfectly accompanying the melody.<br />&quot;In the Warm Room&quot; is a piano-only throwback to Bush's debut, standing in as Lionheart's &quot;Man with a Child in his Eyes&quot;, though here there is more nearly cruel teasing than in the dreamily romantic &quot;Man with a Child in his Eyes&quot;.  Fine piano and lyrics sung as only Bush does, the song is wonderful, but still seems somehow out of place amongst the more innovative orchestrations of the other songs.<br />&quot;Kashka from Baghdad&quot;, a gossipy tale about a woman carrying on a secret relationship, is yet another exploration of the basic template of drum, bass and piano.  But where &quot;Fullhouse&quot; opened into full rock orchestration for its chorus, here Bush sets up an accompanying chorus of voices and percussion instead. The song then slowly blends into a sensuously moody section, with muttering voices and a beautiful-ominous oboe-like keyboard or guitar accompaniment.<br />&quot;Coffee Homground&quot; changes moods entirely, and is a whimsical examination of some German Fraulein who practices the fine art of poisoning.  The kitschiness of the carnival accompaniment, as well as Bush's none-too-convincing German accent, are saved from being awful precisely for the sense of fun Bush brings to the song.  Should anyone still have difficulty separating Bush's personality from the personae she portrays in her songs, this should put the issue to rest once and for all.<br />&quot;Hammer Horror&quot; has the feel of the album's other epic.  A booming opening gives way to an achingly gorgeous vocal line that falls convincingly into another fine rock chorus.  Anyone who wonders why Bush has such a devoted following needs only listen to the pure beauty of her voice in the verse here to understand at once.  Hammer Horror, of course, is not a reference Maxwell's Silver Hammer or some carpentry psychopath, but rather to Britain's Hammer Studios, which was famous in its day for slick but also shlocky horror movies with more than whiff of naughtiness about them.s.

B00004U9MS|5.0|Coldplay is the cat's pyjamas!! This is a craker of an album, it's absolutly brilliant &amp; I highly recommend!
B00000DQSS|5.0|I want to call this a transitional album by Bush, the bridge between the comparatively \\"simple\\" song style of her first two albums and a hint of the intense musical elaboration of her next album, \\"The Dreaming\\". But Bush was a perfectionist who would wait years to put out a new album, so it cannot be accurate at all to construe this as some kind of work-in-progress.  The overall tenor of the album certainly contrasts with her first two albums, specifically for its explorations into more refined sonic backbones for many of the songs.<br /><br />\\"Babooshka\\", an O. Henry type of marital infidelity narrative, begins the album with a very nicely affecting mild rock ballad full of various sound effects, vocal flourishes and Del Palmer's perennially exquisite bass.<br /><br />\\"Delius\\", by comparison, is a rather bland little song about summer graced nevertheless by a lovely chorus.  Pretty as it is, though, it's always seemed too slight to me, or a bit underdeveloped perhaps.  Simply not up to the level I expect from Kate Bush.<br /><br />\\"Blow Away\\", aside from seeming a bit overly personal (i.e., dedicated specifically \\"For Bill\\"), again seems a bit too slight, or not fully developed.  Maybe boring is just the word I'm looking for, though it hardly seems fair.<br /><br />\\"All We Ever Look For\\" is actually nearly as slight as its two predecessors, but is much more full of charm.  More varied orchestration, harpsichord, a very wryly coy chorus with squeaky background vocals, and a montage of footsteps, opening doors and various noises toward the end show signs of more thought, more development and more intelligence than the previous two songs.<br /><br />\\"Egypt\\", by contrast, is a fully and exquisitely developed song from Bush.  Notably and almost entirely non-Egyptian in sound, the chorus, moody-eerie bells, enchanting piano accompaniment and gorgeous development of the song overall almost single-handedly makes me pull out this disk to listen to the whole thing again.  The break toward the end, with that rarest of things in a Bush song (a solo), is positively magical in its mood.<br /><br />Being too much of a good thing to follow, \\"The Wedding List\\", with its \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" orchestration and sensibility simply does not measure up.  The song is a bit of a showcase for a newer, harsher vocals by Bush (compared to her first two albums), but where the bridge of the song finds her mark with her gun, Bush's attempt goes just a bit wide.  Of course, by normal \\"pop\\" reckoning, this song is magnificent, and the quiet vocals leading into the chorus are very fine.<br /><br />\\"Violins\\" is an even more rocking relative of \\"The Wedding List\\" that is both more and less successful than its predecessor.  Musically, the orchestration is tougher and manages to be so conventional to actually have what might be Bush's first traditional guitar solo.  It's the vocals that are hit and miss throughout.  Bush actually very successfully gets her howls down, switching deftly over to her usual warbling, but the glissandos .... well, I'm sure they seemed like good ideas at the time.  In any case, this song most clearly hints at the vocal direction Bush will perfect on her next album.<br /><br />\\"The Infant Kiss\\" is a gorgeous piano ballad reminiscent of \\"Under the Ivy\\".  Elsewhere, she has recorded this song in French.  A kind of throwback to her first album, though the then-dreamy romanticism has been replaced by near-pedophilia, the song is another genuinely beautiful masterpiece that no Bush fan should go without.<br /><br />\\"Night-Scented Stock\\", at 51 seconds, is like one of Chopin's preludes, comprised entirely of vocal harmonies aimed at pure atmospherics.<br /><br />\\"Army Dreamers\\" is again a very slight song, but it's spareness contributes to the quietly brutal mocking of war that the lyrics reflect.  There are also a number of subtle flourishes throughout the song that save it from its somewhat martial repetitiveness.  It's a nicely craftedlittle song, I just don't happen to like it much.<br /><br />\\"Breathing\\", the closing track, is the single unmitigated masterpiece on the album.  To my ear, it actually belongs more on \\"The Dreaming\\" and so is a hint of things to come.  A beautiful combination of piano and bass as only Kate Bush seems capable of putting together, washes of keyboard, an exquisite melody, and even the rather dubiously effective lecture on the nature of an atomic explosion all conspire to create an extraordinarily affecting song.  It definitely ends the album on a high note.ack, is the single unmitigated masterpiece on the album.  To my ear, it actually belongs more on \\"The Dreaming\\" and so is a hint of things to come.

B000002HJR|5.0|my introduction to down was by luck, my friend asked if i wanted to go to the down concert. i told him i have never heard of them he told me it was one of phil's side projects, i was hooked when he said that because pantera is one of my favorite bands. so we arrive in new orleans, and i got blown away that was probally better than any pantera concert i've ever seen. i went out after the show and had to buy nola,every song on this cd is awesome, i don't know if i could pick a favorite, probally temptations wings, although jail and swan song kick [rear] too. i tell everybody that i can about down. what an awesome album!
B00006CXSS|5.0|There are few films/shows that have moved me the way Band of Brothers has, let alone moved me to tears.  This work shows the harsh realities of war and the bonds people make as a result of them.

This is quite simply the finest piece of filmwork I have ever viewed and highly reccomend it to everyone.
B00005JKG9|2.0|I missed this film in its original release and only recently had the opportunity to see what all the hype and fuss was about. Frankly, I was surprised and disappointed. Maybe the story held some social relevance in the early 90's, but I found little I could identify with today. What I did find offended my sensibilities. Sure, the first-rate cast members are at the top of their game spewing acid dialogue like explosive rounds from a 20mm chain cannon. I'll give it two stars for that. But real people simply don't behave this way. Civil, reasonable people would simply walk away from the story's abusive environment. I didn't buy into their predicament.<br />The story begins with Alex Baldwin verbally assaulting the staff like the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. If this happened in the real world today, a couple of hack lawyers would have a field day shutting down the firm and handing out civil law suits ranging from slander, harassment, creating an abusive work environment, blatant age discrimination, and who knows what else. End of story. Roll the credits. But in David Mamet's fantasy world, the liars and cheats swallow this abuse and take out their frustrations on each other, heaping load after load of insults on each other like mud over pigs. There isn't an ounce of compassion or real bonding here. I felt sorry for these losers in an ugly sort of way. The repetition of abuse grows thin until I just wanted to pop out the special edition disc and take a hot shower.<br />So, if your thing is watching an office of grown sadomasochistic men smearing each other for two hours, then go for this. But if you prefer a redeeming value or two in your entertainment, look elsewhere.
0553381709|5.0|The Song of Fire and Ice saga just keeps getting better and better.  This third installment is darker than the previous two, but keeps up the blistering pace set by the first two books.<br />Each of the storylines is significantly developed, and we begin to get even more layers of history and meaning in the characters.  Evil characters from the first two books, like Sandor Clegane and Jamie and Tywin Lannister, are developed so that we gain sympathy for them, understanding their motivations better.  Whiter than white heros such as Ned Stark lose some of their gloss as a clearer picture of their past emerges.<br />Now that I have finished part three, I can begin to talk to my family again..........until I get my hands on the next installment in the saga.

B00005JKZT|3.0|I know a zillion people have written a review on this movie, as well as the first.  Well, here's another.  From a strictly action movie standpoint, I thought the movie was good.  The special effects are amazing.  Especially Gollem.  He was almost completely computer generated.  For a Lord of the Rings fan, however, the movie is gross.  They get the character's names right and their \\"race\\" correct, but that's about it.  Arwen going to the Grey Havens ?????, Frodo and Sam going to Gondor???,  and where the heck did the elves come from at Delm's Keep????  Aragon falling off a CLIFF???.  Unbelievable.  If you are die-hard fan of the book series, you will be gritting your teeth through the entire movie.  For someone who never read the books and just wants to see a great action movie with a lot of dirty, scraggly-haired people, go for it!

B00004RF9B|5.0|This is one of the four greatest SF films of all time, and this DVD truly does it justice. It contains both full screen and 16:9 widescreen formats. The anamorphic 35mm source print for this disk looks freshly struck, and the widescreen presentation exhibits gorgeous color and resolution, especially in the component video mode. The stereo soundtrack exhibits low noise and high fidelity. For those with progressive scan DVD players and true widescreen capable equipment, this disk is a real treat.  If you are at all into SF films, this DVD belongs on your shelf.
B000063K2W|5.0|In 1939, a movie year filled with incomparable classics, it would easy for a movie to get lost in the shuffle.  Not this one!  Without a doubt, The Women is one of the cattiest, funniest, sharpest and wittiest films ever to be captured on celluloid.  Filmed during a period when the Production Code was in effect, the film had to rely on double entrendes and sly deliveries by the performers.  And does it ever succeed.  The lovely Norma Shearer gives one of her final film performances as the devoted and wronged wife, Joan Crawford plays the other woman with social climbing perfection and Rosalind Russell is unforgetable as the gossipy friend of Shearer's who believes in befriending the other woman too.  Also in the cast are Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, Mary Boland, Lucille Watson, Phyllis Povah and Virginia Weidler.  Although much talked about and the center of the storylines are men, there is not a single male player in the film.  (Legend has it that the animals in the film were female and all of the books on a library shelf were written by females). It would be hard for this film to come any closer to perfection.  There is even a brief, colorized fashion show halfway thru.  Do yourself a favor, and pick this one up!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I've always been a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, but really this is what started it all for me! 1999, Princess Mononoke hit theaters, I was there just for fun with some friends, but this movie somehow impacted me, and then I became like the greatest fans really, I have like every movie he's done! This movie has an awesome, interesting, magical story, about a forest god and everything, action packed, oooh it's so great! ....
B00005JKHP|1.0|This may have been the most successful movie in the Star Trek franchise, but it was the least entertaining. I am also a James Bond fan. I never had anything against Roger Moore's movies, but like the Trek franchise, he made a bad first impression with his first movie. Back to Star Trek; It was simply too long and boring for me. I get more excited picking out socks. The plot sounded intrigueing (Did I spell that right?) on paper, but on screen it was a let down. Unlike its far superior sequel \\"Wrath of Khan\\" this movie was built almost entirely upon fancy special effects (Which may not be too terribly groundbreaking by today's standards, but are impressive nonetheless) little time on character development and heartfelt acting. Don't get me wrong, if the score was a measure of the movie's influence, I would give it a perfect score, but I am a man of my word, and face it, the truth hurt's sometimes. While the motion picture set the stage for one of the most entertaining franchises out there, the movie in itself just doesn't do it for me.
0151008116|5.0|A very entertaining and thought provoking tale.  Easy-to-read quality literature that teaches you all about humankinds place in the world.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKCH|4.0|First all of, this DVD comes in two editions identical except for the video format, one being widescreen and other normal 4:3. Buy the widescreen version. A very good video transfer with good sound, this film has a few minor plot points to quibble with and is satisfying overall. Excellent performance from Tobey Maguire demonstrating the dichotomy of his existence. The one major disappointment for me with the film is the title sequence, I was hoping for a modern version of the Spider-Man song!
B00006F83Y|4.0|this album features some major epic rock songs, along with some slow,more contemporary songs.  a lot of the songs are dark and slow, a combination that seems to work extremely well for them.  dont think this is just another poor album.  it is definetly not.  \\"no one knows,\\" the first single features some great guitar, and drumming by dave grohl.  he can still drum, just like with nirvana.  the album is amazing, except the dj spoof gets old at some points.  i defintely reccomend purchasing this album.  i hope this helps you.
B00005JKL8|3.0|When we purchased our home theater surround sound system, both of the salesmen asked us what would be the first DVD we would view upon it. Being a great fan of the beach landing scene in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, I replied to the salesmen that &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; would be our choice. Both of the salesmen exclaimed that the best current movie soundtrack for surround sound systems was &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;. We have recently purchased this DVD more or less to test out its soundtrack. We do enjoy the movie, and while it is not a classic by any means, some people will enjoy it just for the plot, actions scenes, etc. But for us, the payoff was the soundtrack. Out of the approximately 25 DVDs we own, this one approaches most closely the feeling of true three-dimensional sound, and that alone could serve as motivation to own it.
078322933X|4.0|this movie was excellent! i never get scared during a movie but this was so real and scary its unbelievable! Well, what the story was about was pretty much girl meets boy...boy screws girl...girl falls in love w/ boy...boy becomes obsessed and threatens to kill everyone in her life if she doesn't go with him. it was such a good movie i totaly recommend this to anyone, especially teens.
0060537639|5.0|What is a former submarine commander to do upon retiring?  Well this one simply decided to change history as we know it by writing the must read book of the year.  Not a bad follow up to a career in the submarine service during the peak of the cold war.  Commander Menzies has meticulously researched this book and used his extensive practical knowledge of navigation to retrace the voyages of the great Chinese explorers under Admiral Zheng He.  <br />The book is beautifully written and strikes a fine balance between being accessible to the layman while providing adequate detail for other navigators to follow his calculations.  This is a superbly crafted book and the years of detailed research put into it come across in each of the arguments he presents.<br />This book is a must read for any fan of Chinese or maritime history, fans of maritime stories or most importantly, history teachers who want to set the record straight.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Hearing No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland repeatedly on the radio was enough to convince me to buy this CD a week ago. It has left my CD player once, to go in my discman, which is an obvious clue to my opinion of John Mayer's musical abilities. His beautiful voice, youthful but almost world wary lyrics and downbeat instrumentals are just so good, you never feel let down! My fave songs are My Stupid Mouth, a song about [making mistakes] in hopes of fitting in, Love Song for No one, your typical love song with a twist, City Love, about this random relationship...you know what I could go on...I strongly recommend this CD, it's got a song for whatever you're feeling, whenever, wherever, and his work is really easy to relate to. It's a great mix of kind of blues/jazz/poprock/a whole lot of other stuff...Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
6305313687|5.0|Very few movies have ever left me completely speechless....This, however, was one of them.  It's very easy sometimes to forget how harsh and troubled life in America really can be.  Too many of us are lost in the repetitive, mindless, false-sense-of-security world of American suburbia.  We see the violent images on TV, but never truly believe that hate and racial warfare could possibly still be rampant in America.  This movie will snap you back to reality.  Edward Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of young white-supremicist Derek Vinyard.  Equally excellent is Edward Furlong, who portrays Derek's younger brother.  The interplay between the actors is impressive and moving, and this brotherly connection is what ultimately makes this movie work as well as it does.  <br />The American media today is saturated with (mostly international, anti-american) images and rhetoric about fundamentalism, extremism, intolerance, and hate.  Too few of these images, however, have an immediate and personal impact on a sheltered American audience.  This film provides a realistic portrayal of what extremism and bigotry can do when set loose on the streets of America.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Eric Dolphy's &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; is simply put one of the finest moments in the history of recorded jazz.  One may classify it as a combination of the &quot;hard bop&quot; and &quot;free jazz&quot; subclassifications of the jazz tradition, and that assessment would point in the right direction, but &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; is a truly unique set.  The songs are driving, definitely with a &quot;pulse&quot;.  Few albums have so much life in them, sadly ironic that Dolphy did not live to see the release of this landmark... but his spirit will hopefully live on forever in this wonderful album.  It owes a lot to Ornette Coleman and Charles Mingus, but Dolphy completely stepped out on his own with this record.  It is perhaps my favorite jazz record ever.  It at least deserves to be placed high on the list of recognized classics in all jazz, right up there with Miles' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and Coltrane's &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; as simply monumental.  I think those two albums are good comparisons.  Though the three are very distinct from each other, each has a particular feel that most records don't, that everything went right somehow.  That there was something transcendental happening in the music studio that probably nobody could explain.  And that's why we listen to music for that transcendence.  If you get any of this, you must check out &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; if you haven't.  If I just sound like I'm nuts, don't blame the album for that.
B00004Z400|5.0|I remember seeing the Deftones at the 2000 HFStival in MD right before White Pony was released, and you could feel in the crowd as they ripped through the new material, the album is something special.  In my mind, White Pony is argueably one of the best releases since the grunge movement. In it's verocity lies serenity, at its most brutal it maintains a sweeping feeling of urgency and calm, and a timeless magic all its own. All of the cuts on the White Pony are solely their own, and yet seem to blend and sway into one solid piece. In listening to the White Pony, I feel the same magic I haven't felt since Sonic Youth's &quot;Daydream Nation,&quot; Pavement's &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; or even Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind,&quot; with all the feeling that seem to collide into one.  To alienate certain cuts would be a betrayal of the album. It is a masterpiece all its own.
B00005JM09|5.0|Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines is finally going to unveil the story of how the machines were born, their legacy and reason behind waging war on mankind.

Arnold is back, looking as big, strong and powerful as ever.

B00007BHOE|5.0|When I started watching it I couldnt belive it... I heard the first few songs and I was out of my seat screaming and jumping around! this DVD is more than perfect! its! damn words arent enough to discribe it! IF YOUR A SLIPKNOT FAN GO OUT AND BUY IT! FAST!
0812550706|5.0|Like the heading says, anybody can enjoy this book.  This book has a lot of brain, but also a lot of just plain old fantastic intensity that would thrill anybody!  The character, Ender, is so easy to want to follow more and more.  I am young, but my mom enjoyed this book to!  So did my brother.  This book is just really awesome!  You have gotta read it!
1573222038|5.0|A dark novel in which one cannot know what to expect for one cannot foresee the dark intent of others.  Repel as you like but be caught up in a world where no good truly exists and where there is madness at every turn.  Cling to your sanity as best you could for the harsh realities of the world can truly drive one to madness.<br />A great read.  Interesting turn of events.  Wonderfully handled.
0375414053|1.0|From my wife: I read this book because I am a full-time working mother with a 6 & 3 year old & because it was recommended on the Today Show, Oprah, radio, you name it. I was extremely angered & dismayed by the portrayal of Kate as the \\"typical\\" working mother. First of all, UNLIKE Kate, I do not put my job above all else. I don't travel much & my life is much more organized than Kate's. I don't work because I want to, I work because I have to. I work because I want to give my kids a good life, in a nice house & I want to have a savings account & send them to college & buy more than just macaroni & cheese for dinner. I have a supportive husband who helps out quite a bit & I don't have a cleaning lady or nanny. Would I like more time in my life, yes! Absolutely! But, I thought Kate's behavior throughout the book was shocking & quite unrealistic. Overall, I feel this book gives all working mothers a bad rap. Although it was well-written & evoked some happy & sad emotions while reading it, the message it sends to all mothers, whether they work or not, is terrible! Basically it says to be a really bad mother, put work above all else (at the sacrifice of everything in this life that means something), & ignore everyone's needs but your own to the detriment of your children, family & friends. No THANKS! You can keep it. Don't waste one minute of your time reading this book. It will only make you want to scream at the horrible portrayal of working mothers that is presented & shake some sense into Kate.
B00004Y6NT|4.0|This is Dire Straits second cd(lp). It's better than the debut overall. Some real good songs on here are Once Upon a time in the West, Angel of mercy, and Portobello belle. Lady Writer was the most likely to have been the single. Overall a good effort but I still like Love over Gold and Makin Movies over this one.
B000002H33|5.0|War, drugs, illness, and oppression. Everyone of these issues are examined lyrically and musically with a fine comb and magnifying glass, which makes you feel like you are being controlled physically and emotionally by the instruments of the highly talented musicians that make Metallica, outstanding acheivers in metal history. 'Master of puppets' is a hands-down winner around the globe, serving as an esential item to any metal CD collection. From the moment the play button is pressed, 'Master of Puppets' starts spinning a whirlwind of immense power and control as the album is pertinacious to get it's view accross to the listener.<br />Let me take your attention to a few of the best songs on the disk, lyrically and musically to give you an idea how well this masterpiece evolves. 'Master of Puppets' is a song that explores drug addiction and how drug users get so addicted to deadly drugs that they cannot make their own decisions anymore. Along with very meaningful verses, 'Master of Puppets' has a series of killer riffs and an amazing guitar solo by Kirk Hammett that makes the song one of the most memerable on the album. \\"Welcome to where time stands still, No one leaves and no one will. Moon is full, never seems to change, Just labeled mentally deranged\\". A Chain of verses inspired by the movie, 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest', cements together the backbone of my favourite song on the album, 'Welcome Home'(Sanitarium). Filled with emotional lyrics and unforgetable guitar work, all four musicians put their heads together to create a song that couldn't be written any better.<br />Another song I would like to bring to your attention is 'Disposable Heroes'. Heavy power chords set the scene to a fast, angry, classic war song that shows, some leaders of war have to much power over their soldiers actions and treat them like lab mice on a deathfield of bloodshed, only worried if their objectives are completed with no sympathy for the soldiers. The meaning behind this monster song is best represented with the verses, \\"Soldier boy made of clay, Now an empty shell. Twenty one, Only son, But he served us well. Bred to kill, not to care, Do just as we say\\".<br />'Master of Puppets' is a metal masterpiece that will leave a smile on any Metallica fan's face from the start to it's final valediction and nine times out of ten the listener will be tempted into playing the disk over and over again. This album is a five star effort that will make listeners of any type of music appreciate the work Metallica put into their song construction.     <br /> R.I.P Cliff Burton.
B00006SFLV|3.0|My So Called Life is indeed, as many say, the first tv series to accurately portray the high school condition.  Few TV series have had such an diverse cast of characters and stories that seem genuinely a part of one another's lives.<br />The only downside to the My So Called Life complete series DVD is on the technical side.  The sound quality seems fair at best.  Anytime music plays there is noticeable distortion, at times severe.  I've never experienced this issue, or anything similar, on any DVD so I do not believe this is a technical issue with my theater setup.  I'm not sure how a DVD can be released for sale with such poor sound quality.<br />As of now I have gone though half the episodes and all have music related distortion problems.  Except for the opening title sequence I've yet to find a scene that has music and no distortion.  While the content of series is in tact, the audio distortion does ruin some of the best scenes.  Fans of the series should be aware of the audio distortion problem.
B000002H97|4.0|i think every metallica fan should have this cd.its awesome(not a sell out cd,but a cd of them maturing).this was the first album i ever listened to,i was in 4th grade,that was 6 or 7 years ago.this is one of their better albums for sure.its less thrash than and justice for all,more radio friendly,and slower.alot of great songs like unforgievn,nothing else matters,sad but true,enter sandman,etc..i really love track 9:of wolf and man.master of puppets also a great album.if you want a cd to headbang more to go buy master of puppets..but if you want to relax more this is good(atleast thats what i think).<BR>well i didnt give it a 5 because it wasnt as heavy as their previous album and justice for all,but other than that this is an excellent album.and the people who dont like this cd are completly stupid.
0553103547|2.0|There's only one way to describe this book: a Fantasy Soap Opera.  This has EVERYTHING you get in your favorite soap opera:  1.  Lots of characters  2.  A story that takes FOREVER to develop, and even longer for anything to happen, and has no end in sight  3.  Sex and infidelity/immorality galore, sometimes more explicit than necessary (yes I know these things happen in real life, but we don't need explicit details to get the picture)  4.  A story with many threads, each thread getting its turn in little snippets - VERY little snippets.<br />Not to say that soap operas are necessarily bad, but they definitely aren't my thing, and neither was this book.<br />Another thing that turned me off was that this didn't have any of the fun magical-type things you get in other fantasies.  Isn't that what fantasy's all about?
0151008116|2.0|Maybe it's because I have a religious studies degree and have studied Indian history that I won't wax lyrically about this book. &quot;Life of PI&quot; didn't help me find God, quite the contrary, I found it had little to do with the mystery and magic of the otherworldly. What I did find was a writer who relished in describing how one animal rips apart another. Don't believe the people who tell you this is a kind of fable for the whole family. Unless you enjoy the Fight for Life kind of documentaries where animals hunt down another and then we get closeups of their rolling eyes and spurting blood, you'll best avoid this book with a body count.<BR>If you like stories about castaways, rent the Tom Hanks film. Don't get all starry eyed because a book is set in an exotic landscape and deals with &quot;foreign&quot; ideas. It had some interesting ideas but other than that was a real grisly waste of time.
B000005RDY|5.0|This title is one of the best the &quot;The Best Of&quot; compilations I've ever heard. I own other &quot;best of&quot; CDs but they usually deliver the commercial songs of the band or artist. I don't really know if it's due to the fact that Budgie was not a commercial blast, but this CD shows the essence of the band and is certainly a very good acquisition for anyone who likes true hard rock / heavy metal.
B000068PQ0|5.0|THis cd is amazing!  I've never heard anything like it n my life.  I never thought I could like something like this but Its incredible!  I bought it for a few reasons. 1. I heard part of Fight Test on tv.  2. I saw a sticker on it that had some of the best reviews I've seen in a long time  for a cd.  3. I liked the cover art.  I know its nts to get a cd because of the cover art but I did.<br />I don't regret getting this cd at all.  Its been playing in my cd player and on my computer ever since I bought it.  I highly recommend this cd to anyone.  I think there's something on it that everyone can appresiate and enjoy.
B00005AAFS|5.0|These guys are amazing. This is their third disc and every song is great on all three discs!!! In addition Wilder Wein on the live album and Das Model and Kokain from their recent single are all awesome. They can't do anything wrong. Although not as Apocalyptic as Trent Reznor, they rock the house like no one else. They are Ministry one notch up. They can stand up to MM.<BR>Their is absolutely no way any fan of pop music (not only metal or industrial) will not like this album. All the songs are stupendous. Links rocks. Ich Will bangs. Mein Herz Brent and Mutter are classic.<BR>Till Lindemann is a genius, no doubt. The bandmates are great musicians. The synchronization of the guitars is something to behold. Don't waste anymore time without this disc.
015626224X|5.0|Consider all the stereotypes and aspersions cast on the homeless by society. Most often the homeless are viewed as drunks that are too lazy or selfish to help themselves and turn to others for help instead. And then read George Orwells gritty, realistic account of poverty in Down and Out in Paris and London. Ones views of the homeless should certainly change. The characters created by Orwell in the novel are so deep and multi-layered, they become more than just fictional characters, or worthless vagabondsone learns to love, respect, and care about the well being of all the colorful characters in the novel.<br />The main character of the novel is George Orwell, and Englishman whose tale opens in the Rue du Coq dOr, one of the slums of Paris. He is not doing too well financially, and is barely making enough money to support himself as a private English teacher, and keep his apartment, which is so rundown and dirty, the streets are barely cleaner. When George Orwell is robbed, his luck takes a turn for the worst. He has no money left, and goes almost a week without any food. By pawning several items in his apartment, he earns enough money to get food and find a job. He turns to his friend Boris, and waiter, for help, and together they get a job at a restaurant in a hotel. The work is roughthe job as a plongeur, as given to Orwell, is one that requires him to work 16 hour days, six days a week. One thing leads to another, and Orwell leaves Paris, and heads back to London.<br />The London painted by Orwell in the novel is very different than Paris. Orwell characterizes it as better and cleaner, but the harsh life of homelessness is much similar in London, if not in some ways worse. A homeless person cannot sit on the street or sidewalk, for he is thrown into jail for loitering. A straight out beggar, will also be thrown into jail for harassing others. So many of the homeless turn to spikeslabor camps where they are provided shelter in turn for work.  The miraculous thing about all the homeless encountered and created by George Orwell is their sinceritysometimes they spend all their money on alcohol, and get drunk, or piddle the money away on tobacco or one enormous meal. But the vagabonds created by Orwell are strangely respectableit is difficult to describe, but in some ways they are better, more pure and compassionate human beings than those with money and homes.<br />I think that Down and Out in Paris and London is a wonderful novel, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the life of a homeless person during the 1920s in both cities. Although, I do believe the novel not only describes the homeless in the time period in which Orwell set the novel, but it describes the homeless all throughout our country and the world today. Also, if you love George Orwell, and his intelligent concise writing style, and satirical viewpoints on society found in both Animal Farm and 1984, you will thoroughly enjoy this novel. I loved meeting the characters found by Orwell throughout the novel, the colorful tales each encompassed and told, and the general themes of both hope and hopelessness of the vagabonds in the novel, formed into some paradoxical combination. I found the novel funny, ironic, satirical, fascinating, and think that many others will as well.
0553801511|5.0|This book is excellent, a worthy successor to the Liveship and Assassin series. It is reminiscent of Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books with a protagonist who has very human failings and has to live with the consequences of the decisions he has made in the past.<br />The other characters in the book are similarly complex, and it's the interaction between the various characters, and the dialogue that keep you turning the pages, rather than the somewhat low-key plot. I also enjoyed seeing some of the characters from the Liveship books, and the hints about what is happening in Bingtown.<br />The other thing I like about the series is that I am confident that Hobb will tie finish the series up in the third book, rather than subjecting to us to a long, drawn-out sequence of novels of ever-decreasing quality, a la Robert Jordan or David Farland.<br />Can't wait for book three!
B00005YU1O|3.0|Why? Because watching this I found myself both utterly fascinated and completely bored at the same time.  I'm fascinated by the dreaming state of mind.  For better and for worse, Waking Life gets at the idea of what dreams are like with an original take on the idea.  It doesn't all work, but it's better than a lot of other slicker films out there. At the very least this is a film about ideas rather than blowing stuff up; it tries (if not always succeeds) to engage the viewer's mind rather than play as mere eye candy.
B000067FP7|5.0|I love this movie very much.  I have bought the laser disc of Gremlins years ago.  Thanks to the technology and Warner Brothers, we can see again this movie in 5.1 channel, and most important of all, the extras and never-before-seen footage and the cast commentary.  For such a valuable price, this is a MUST for your DVD library!!
B00005RJ1U|2.0|Jeepers Creepers had so much potential but the director and I suppose, the producer blew it. What was that dialog about the mother all about at the begining? It went nowhere. The plot holes are just too big to forgive. If someone runs you off the road what do you do? You call the cops on your cell phone or you drive off and report it later. The brother and sister in this movie decide to go check the \\"guy\\" who nearly killed them out. You see the weird dude who nearly killed you stuffing what looks like a body into a pipe. What do you do? Get the heck out of there, right? No...these idiots decide to investigate.  Obviously the brother and sister had to run into the Creeper some kind of way to get the movie started but this was simply idiotic. <BR>The Creeper does this every 23 years, so how come no one in town seems to have noticed missing loved ones? In fact, how come the folks in town don't just go on vacation during the Creeper's feeding time? <BR>The Creeper himself is a scary creature until you see all of him then he becomes a laughable special effect. Okay, I'll admit that the last iamge of the movie was impressive but that's five minutes in an otherwise dopey movie.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I was intrigued when I saw the previews, but didn't necessarily want to go see it.  My boyfriend wanted to however so I went with him.  I was suprised at how good and how close to the book it was.  It came out on my son's first birthday, so I took him to see it too, not sure if he would be good, but willing to try since I knew I liked it and he was glued to the TV when it was advertised.  My one-ear-old sat enthralled by the animation, (but he kept laughing at all the quiet suspenseful moments).  I have since bought him books, clothes, and toys pertaining to the movies, and plan to buy him the DVD as soon as it's available.
6305165912|3.0|I dont get why everyone loves this movie so much, it has some good moments but never really goes anywhere and it seems way too long (whether or not it is long doesnt matter, it felt like many many hours to me).<br />Alos whats up with that irritating cowboy? He should of been cut.
B00005AQE8|5.0|THE EASIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM IS 'ITS GANGSTA TO THE FULLEST'
0790737345|2.0|OK, just to get this out of the way up front, this is another review preferring &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; over this glossy remake.<br />It's not that I utterly detest &quot;City of Angels.&quot; The director borrowed well from Wim Wenders' German original, particularly the nifty images of dark-coated angels roaming in this world, not in direct contact with human beings, but still able to influence them. And the leads, Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan and Dennis Franz, are capable actors.<br />And yet, and yet ... in the end, &quot;City of Angels&quot; is merely about a supernatural being who becomes human just to get into the sack with a pretty woman, overlaid with some homilies tacked on about how much he sacrificed to achieve that state, and everything being worth it no matter what tragedy strikes.<BR>Guess they thought they were brave in giving the movie a sad, yet ultimately uplifting ending, but it falls flat.<br />In &quot;Wings of Desire,&quot; the angel's passion for a certain woman is the precipitating factor for him taking the plunge (quite literally), but it's just the final influence in a long-held desire to experience all the sensations that being human confers. Indeed, we never really see the two &quot;get together,&quot; and really, there's no need to. There's also much more of a spiritual dimension in the original as opposed to the pat, feel-good sort of theology tacked on to &quot;City of Angels.&quot;<br />Yes, &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; has a much more deliberate pace than &quot;City of Angels&quot; and it does spin out a lot of philosophy, but don't let that scare you away. You don't need a college degree to enjoy it - just a willingness to take the time and let its subtle spell envelop you.<br />And I'll bet you'll find the moment in &quot;Wings&quot; when Peter Falk says, &quot;I can't see you,&quot; but I know you're there,&quot; much more delightful than the same moment Dennis Franz has in &quot;City.&quot;
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This was the best film of 2002. The performances from Hugh Grant to Nicholas Hoult to Toni Collette to Rachel Weisz are excellent. Grant and Collette should recieve Oscar nods for the stunning performances as a selfish, hip London cad and a depressed, suicidal single mum. The film successfully combines comedy and drama to create a thoroughly enjoying and moving cinematic experience. All should see this film. It is a DVD must have. About a Boy is brilliant and stunning from top to bottom.
B000002J29|5.0|um, this is a bit of an odd review. You see, I'm 17 and my taste in music is diverse, weird and inexperienced. Ranging from &quot;Indie&quot;, &quot;Prog' Rock&quot;, &quot;Rock n Roll&quot;, &quot;Jazz&quot;, &quot;Classical&quot;, I'm usually caught listening to musicians like Radiohead, Dire Straits, R.E.M, U2, Jeff Buckley etc......Genesis might not seem like an obvious choice. They've had an interesting history, which undoubtably affected the kind of music they made but don't think about that. This is really good. No question. <br />Whenever listening to &quot;old (better)&quot; Genesis I'm always reminded of how I used to fall asleep to it during long car journeys with my Dad(big Genisis fan - saw them in Rome in the '70s, apparently one of the most amazing things he's ever seen/felt). It was a kind of magical, scary lullaby. Now I'm older (and more of a musical snob)I understand why my dad likes them. Seconds Out is a good reason why. The set list is a very good one (they have so much material to offer), however the performances are seriously spot on. My dad (sorry to make this personal but Genesis is rooted in my childhood, I'm trying to explain) told me that all the times he saw Genesis, they were even better live than on their studio recordings. Compare the cuts on Seconds Out to their album versions and you might agree. I do.<br />If you're new to Genesis and are sceptical (as I would be) just relax and listen to this. Yeah sure its Collins instead of Gabriel but Phil Collins does have a clear, lovely voice (arguably not as good as Peter Gabriel's - anyone checked out Gabriels new stuff? - ouch). The music is full and almost colourful. The pace on the songs changes regularily, bouncy and tongue in cheek, then melencholy and emotional. One thing you'll notice about these guys is their musical texture (loads of gutsey, well played instruments) and lyrics (which are very weird at times, very finite and heartbreaking at others).<br />Right sorry, enough is enough. I believe this is an excelent live album and thinks its a good introduction to Genesis and a must have whatever. It displays their appeal and talent spiffingly. I'm biased and like every track on the album, however favourites include The Carpet Crawl (chilled), Afterglow (don't listen to this if you're trying to get over the love of your life ~sniff~), I Know What I Like (&quot;me? I'm just a lawnmower&quot;), The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, The Musical Box, Supper's Ready (possibly my favourite Genesis track, it's epic though gorgeous) and Dance On a Volcano/Los Endos.<br />Enjoy.
0761536434|5.0|I have always enjoyed video games, be it arcade, hand-held, or home gaming systems. And lately, I have been getting more and more into home electronic games. As such, I was very interested when I found this title on Amazon.com for under $... (U.S.) <br />The Ultimate History of Video Games is an impressive name for any book, and weighing in at 624 pages, you would think that Steven L. Kent has written just that. Without reading very many other books about the history of video games and the companies that create them, I would have to say that for me, this is an accurate statement. <br />The book, however, ends a little early. Neither the X-BOX nor the Nintendo GameCube had hit the streets when this title was published in September 2001. Unfortunate, as I think the current state of video games is more interesting than the Pokemon craze that this book ends on. <br />For those wondering just what happened at Atari, this book will tell you. How in the world did Nintendo ever revive video games after the almost-death of the industry after the early 1980÷s? When did SEGA become a big player, and where are they now? How did the Sony PlayStation ever get a foothold in the gaming market, and how did they end up trouncing Nintendo at the beginning of this decade? Who were the people that created all those great games? What is the best selling video game of all time? The Ultimate History of Video Games will tell you.<br />I would rather have seen this book broken up into multiple books. Ten-year increments to the story would have been nice, which would have given the author more time and space to really delve more into each company and game along the way. While Atari, Activision, Coleco, and other pioneering video game companies are represented well in the story, I would have loved more in-depth coverage. (Besides Atari, which is the entire first two-thirds of this book, but for good reasons.)<br />All negativity aside, I really enjoyed this book. It was a pleasure to read. Unlike some other history books which cover other industries, and some which cover the video game world as well, this book is filled with human interest stories, not just how many units of the Atari 2600 version of PacMan sold. <br />Steven L. Kent is a gifted writer who put a lot of time and passion into this book. I think he did a great job, and the only real gripe I have is that the book ended before I wanted it to. With luck, he has plans on reviving newer editions every few years to chart the progress of the industry. <br />If you are at all curious about the history of video games, you will want this book. Don÷t buy it hoping to find color photos or screen snapshots of Donkey Kong. This book is almost all text, for a very good reason. This is the Ultimate History of Video Games, after all, and 624 pages barely cover it. <br />Hats off, Mr. Kent. A job well done. <br />Highly recommended!<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tim Robertson
B000002J29|5.0|um, this is a bit of an odd review. You see, I'm 17 and my taste in music is diverse, weird and inexperienced. Ranging from &quot;Indie&quot;, &quot;Prog' Rock&quot;, &quot;Rock n Roll&quot;, &quot;Jazz&quot;, &quot;Classical&quot;, I'm usually caught listening to musicians like Radiohead, Dire Straits, R.E.M, U2, Jeff Buckley etc......Genesis might not seem like an obvious choice. They've had an interesting history, which undoubtably affected the kind of music they made but don't think about that. This is really good. No question. <br />Whenever listening to &quot;old (better)&quot; Genesis I'm always reminded of how I used to fall asleep to it during long car journeys with my Dad(big Genisis fan - saw them in Rome in the '70s, apparently one of the most amazing things he's ever seen/felt).

B0000004V2|4.0|As the owner of over 3,000 CD's I think I qualify as someone who can comment on \\"earth shattering\\", \\"greatest album on earth\\" claims and this is not it.  Whilst it is a good album, perhaps great (hence the 4 stars) it is not as good as the 100+ reviews I've read suggests it is.  Perhaps it's the fact that it was an excellent debut album or the fact that not much else followed from the SR's, although Second Coming is not bad, that clouds peoples perceptions of this album.  It certainly is a quality album throughout with little or no filler, although I think the 8+ & 9+ minute \\"Resurrection\\" & \\"Fool's Gold\\" are more an example of 70's and 80's overextended \\"wig outs\\" than brilliant crossover dance tracks, as some have suggested.  Once again, I don't want to put a downer on things here, and whilst I agree that this was certainly the forerunner of most Britpop that followed, it is not the \\"era defining\\" or \\"best ever\\" album that most reviewers are suggesting.  I won't start a pointless arguement here by listing albums which I think are better but believe me there are many.<br />Nonetheless any serious CD collection would be incomplete without this.<br />Enjoy!!!!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|THIS WAS ONE CRAZY. I WATCH THIS MOVIE ALL THE TIME. ITS SO FUNNY AND THE THING BOUT IT IS THAT U CANT NEVER GET ENOUGH OF IT. IF U LIKE COMEDY THEN I THINK U WOULD LIKE THIS MOVIE.

B0000009OP|2.0|Candy says stop stealing Lou Reed's lyrics.<br /><br />I must admit to liking \\"Buena,\\" but this album, with its horns and airport bar vocals, is cheese city.  This album is for the Adult Alternative crowd.  That's not entirely true.  It's for ironic indie kids with Adult Alternative souls.<br /><br />Shronk!

B00005JL7Q|4.0|well if youve seen any other oh hugh grants movies, they are usually sort of slick suave and feminine. this one, though it complies with a grant-movie stereotype, it does much more than its predecessors. one of the few genuinally happy films of 2002, it actually relates to people and shows some real reason for its releasing. its about a young boy who is living a terribly rough childhood with his depressed mother as his only family. until he stumbles upon a snobby wealthy man (hugh grant) who is (un-admitted by him) also quite lonely. the boy fights through this man's denial for him and keeps pushing to be his friend til the man stops ignoring him and starts to find his first true friend in a young but sharply honest boy. a funny twist to the movie is that its title 'about a boy' seems to obviously point to the boy in the film but in conclusion seems to be referring to the boy in a man's body (grant) and the story about how he matured.
0792846338|5.0|Not knowing what will happen next!  Kathy Bates is unbelievable good in her role as Annie.   James Caan is also excellent in this film.  This is one suspense drama that really keeps you on the edge of your seat.   One of my favorite movies of all times.
B000008H1Y|5.0|I'm a younger Tull fan than most, but have heard a good amount of their work.  Anderson is, what I believe to be, the finest musician in terms of rythmic complexity as well as meaningful songwriting.  &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; captures every good aspect of Tull's music and, for me, is the most enjoyable to listen to.  I suggest this album to anyone.
630428540X|5.0|This movie made me laugh and cry.  What a &quot;phenomenal&quot; actor John Travolta is and always has been.   This particular movie really touches the heart; because here is a such a gentle soul who wishes to do good for people; only to be turned against.  Robert Duvall is also great in this film.  I recommend this movie highly.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I love Audioslave's new CD!!  I have a 16 year old son who listens mostly to &quot;alternative&quot;-style music and it used to be a battle of wits to see which radio station we'd listen to in the car......no more the case.  We just put in this new CD! Actually my son's pretty embarrassed that his mother knows the words, but I really think the lead singer has a great, very distinctive voice that fits or MAKES the flavor of the songs.  The synthesizer in Like a Stone is perfect....this song seems to have a bit of a BDSM flavor to it (am I wrong?) I may have to buy a second CD if I wear this one out!  Looking forward to the next one.  Thanks.
B00006G8LB|5.0|My daughter begged me for weeks to watch this with her.  I was thinking....NO not another superhero \\"kapow\\" \\"Klablooey\\" film.  I finally agreed.  WOW, what a film. Tobey McGuire is so sweet and cute and you just had to love him.  This was a definite evil versus good movie and I found it quite entertaining.   A must to watch and own.     WONDERFUL!
B00006879E|5.0|What can I say but this is an AMAZING CD.  I first saw Maroon 5 on \\"Last Call with Carson Daly\\" on NBC last September 2002.  I was replaying a tape I had made of the previous night's show to watch when I came home from work. (I can never stay up late enough to watch the original broadcasts).  <br />It was near the end of the show, and Carson had spent most of the program interviewing some actress (Parker Posey or Piper Perabu -- someone with a lot of 'P's in their name) and I got up to get some food.  I was half way to the kitchen and I started hearing this unbelievably funky music coming out of my TV.<br />I ran back to my set, and I couldn't believe my eyes.  There were five white guys playing the most soulful, funky music I've heard in a L-O-N-G time.  Maroon 5 played their first single, \\"Harder to Breathe\\".  I was impressed enough to save their performance on tape instead of taping over it with the next night's show.<br />I'm an R&B fan mostly, and I have a pretty good knowledge of most soul and R&B music. I know there hasn't been an R&B or soul band on the charts since Toni, Tony, Tone (Raphael Sadiq) called it quits in 1996.  Maroon 5 is a unique combination of soul, funk and rock music.  The closest comparison I can come up with is the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and as much as I like the Chilli Peppers, I think that Maroon 5's lead singer, Adam Levine, has a voice with more range than Anthony Kiedis of the Chilli Peppers.<br />I made a mental note to myself to check out their CD the next time I had a chance, and when I was at Borders a few days later, I sampled selections from their CD, \\"Songs About Jane\\".  You know you have a keeper when you don't even skip over tracks when you're sampling the CD in a record store.  I bought the CD right there, played the CD in my car the rest of that day,  and it has been in heavy rotation in my CD changer ever since.<br />I also caught Maroon 5 live opening for O.A.R. at the House of Blues in L.A. last November 2002.  I was totally blown away.  They are a phenomenal live band -- raw, hot, sexy, full of kinetic energy. <br />Since then, I learned that 4 out of 5 of the members  of Maroon 5 are from right here in L.A.(my home). They have got to be L.A.'s best kept secret.  When I look at the stuff that's on the charts right now, I don't see any bands that even come close to what they are doing, which explains why they haven't broken out yet. But it will happen, believe me it will happen.  Real SOON.<br />I just bought tickets to see them perform as a headliner this time at the House of Blues on January 27, 2003 and I know they are going to set that stage on fire.  <br />Even John Mayer (grammy nominee), who Maroon 5 supported on part of his last tour, is singing their praises.  In an ad for their upcoming House of Blues shows, he is quoted as saying the following about Maroon 5:  \\"The perfect blend of melody & grit.  One of the best bands to come along in a while.\\"<br />If you like funk/rock  or rock/soul music -- heck if you like music that has a fantastic melody, and lyrics that complement the music perfectly, you will love this CD.<br />Don't sleep on this one!  You will be sorry you did.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Hello everyone<BR>My name isn't important, and I will just make this simple. I don't like the movie because I think it ended the reader's imagination. Before the movie, I have no doubts that everyone has their own version of Hogwarts in their brains, and it was fun to share. But now, I may say, we have to accept it the way it is. I guess this happens when fame arrives. <BR>Anyways, the film is fantastic, and I really like the performance of Daniel Radcliffe. I'm sure the naxt one will be better and better.<BR>Thanks,<BR>A Reader and Fan of Harry Potter
B000002UB3|4.0|Although one of my favorite albums, its easy to tell that the Beatles were no longer the cohesive unit they had been during the Rubber Soul/Revolver days.  However, this is still a fine album that shows the potential as each of the members did what they did best.
0312305060|5.0|Cunningham not only brings Virginia Woolf to life in his novel &quot;The Hours,&quot; but he also brings her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; to life as well.  The book is a joy to read:<br />*it's unutterably clever in the way it unobtrusively echoes the plot and characters of &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; serving as a tribute to that novel and recalling its very themes<br />*it's gorgeously written in long, rhythmic, sumptuous sentences that echo Woolf's own style<br />*it's brilliantly constructed as it moves back and forth among its three story lines, and I truly can't remember a more satisfying conclusion to a novel in years<br />*it will move you and it will stay with you once you've finished reading it<br />And now a confession:  when I read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; as an immature college student many years ago, I failed to appreciate it.  In fact, I put off reading &quot;The Hours&quot; for some time because of my college reading experience.  I'm certainly glad I've grown up enough to have opened the covers of this lovely, lovely book.
0316666343|5.0|I finished reading The Lovely Bones several weeks ago, and I'm still comparing every book I read to it.<br />I found this book to be told in such a loving, gentle manner that I was quite caught up in the story.  How amazing that such a horrifying tale could be so beautiful!<br />Told from the perspective of the spirit of a raped and murdered child, it follows the lives of her friends and family as they deal with their grief and fears as the years progress.<br />I recommend this book highly.
1878424319|2.0|Admittedly, the tenets espoused by Ruiz are of some value, however, the problem is that the message could easily have been decocted into half the number of pages this book has.  At times the explanations of the concepts seem so childishly elementary and basic, that it frustrates you to think that you've wasted your time reading the entire chapter, when it was all clearly explained in the first two paragraphs... <br />This problem is by no means endemic to this book, however, as most self-help books suffer the same fate.  Would it be too difficult to find something well written that also has a good message?<br />Nonetheless, if you do choose to buy this book, don't believe you will be the recipient of some great literary work.

B00006G8HX|2.0|The print of ST3:The Search For Spock is good but there are some disappointments with the extras. For example,the camera work done in interviews with Nimoy and Shatner on disc 2 look as if they were done by hopeless cameramen. The shots are ridiculously close,almost up Nimoy's nose! Why didn't the \\"cameraman\\",for want of a better word,have the commonsense to pull the shot back? The average amateur could do a better job with his homemade videos. What is it with Paramount that they aren't doing a professional job on the extras? The same thing happened with the interviews on ST2 and now we have pitifully amateurish camera work on this DVD. This is not good enough.<BR>The DVD also does have some good photos but no deleted scenes.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD. My wife and 14 month old daughter and I listen to it every morning while getting ready. It sets the tone for our day. I could listen to the album all day long. And I love the Hank Williams remake. Enjoy!
B0000025D0|5.0|Darkenss is one of the few albums I can remember the feelings I had the first time I played it. Everytime I've played it since, gives me that same feeling. Pick a song, any song, and the power is almost overwhelming. Bruce was prevented from recording for about 3 years. The best way to describe this album is just imagine all those pent up feelings building up inside him for 3 years. It just all exploded on this album. There's trouble in heartland allright. But with Bruce, by the end most things are right. Or at least there's light at the end of the tunnel. By the time Racing In the Streets rolls around, he's gotten up off the deck, one more time, and is ready to give it everything he has, one more time.<BR>If the only album Bruce ever did was  Born to Run he would have secured his place in music history. It is hard to imagine anything better. THIS is better. It is Bruce's masterpiece.
B00005RDSM|4.0|I'm still a fan of the Disney Classics but I have to say that Peter Pan isn't one of my favorites and for the same reason that a lot of people don't like this one and that is the scenes with the Indians (hence 4 stars unstead of 5).<br />PETER PAN is about the boy who could never grow up and after chasing his shadow in the bedroom of Wendy, John and Michael, he invites the 3 to fly with him to Neverland. It's a wonderful story of adventure, fun and flying. All children will enjoy this one.<br />Now again, my reason for taking a star off is obviously for the derogatory and stereotypical depiction of Native Americans in this movie. Regardless that this movie was made in 1953 still doens't make it right. As parents, it really should be the responsibilty of the parents to explain and to teach children the right way. I will say that every child should enjoy PETER PAN, but afterwards every parent should take the time to explain to the children that making fun of another culture is wrong.<br />Either way it goes, if you're looking for other great Disney classics look for BEAUTY AND THE BEAST SPECIAL EDITION, THE FOX AND THE HOUND, ROBIN HOOD, SLEEPING BEAUTY and CINDERELLA. Also check out some of the new Disney's like MONSTERS INC and TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2.
0060955775|5.0|Life is a miracle and a gift, especially when one considers everything that can happen in each second of one's life.  How often do we recognize our life as such?  Not often enough, according to the characters that Paulo Coelho weaves together in a captivating tale that follows a young woman who fails in her attempt to commit suicide, but must live for a week knowing that her life will end shortly.  Although it is a familiar territory (i.e. introducing death as a motivation for living) for novels that trace human beings' search for meaning, the story unfolds with a precision and accuracy rarely touched upon before.  It is a perfect book for those who have realized, either in their personal lives or by allowing themselves to be affected by the constant flow of tragic and chaotic headlines from around the world, that life is short, unpredictable, and without room for fear, or hesitations about the past and future.  Coelho encourages us, with his illustrations of death and the fragility of life, that all we have is the present and the present must be tackled without doubt and especially without fear, as fear has become a feeling which human beings today have replaced so many of their emotions with.  If one allows it to be so, \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" can be a life changing story.
B00005QDW1|2.0|this cd was a huge disappointment. The lyrics had no substance or meaning or even story for that matter. Its a bunch of ramblings made to sell cds and sadly it worked. If you want decent no doubt buy tragic kingdom but please don't waste money on this
B00006RIO7|5.0|Well, first of all it's Chicago! One of Foss's best achievments. NOw I have seen the movie and it brings justice to the show. Even though most of the numbers are dream sequences, you cannot tell on this cd. Then again You could not tell that the show was supposed to be styled as a vaudeville show on the original soundtrack unless you were smart enough to read the front right underneath the logo in dark and blurry letters. The cover makes the musical look more flashy and sexy than the pitifl drawing on the original and the stills from the revival on the other cd. <BR>    The opening song on this new soundtrack is one but a treasure from the first note to Catherine Zeta-Jones belting \\"NO I'm no ones wife!\\" The orchestrations are fantastic and make the score seem more appealing and it feels so energetic that you want to get up and dance along with it. And to the song \\"Nowadays\\" the additional section \\"Hot Honey Rag\\" really gives you a bonus. Now the cast. Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job and unlike the other Roxies that have been recorded, her voice is trained and can carry a tune (no offense to Gwen Verdon and Ann Reinking).<BR>   Richard Gere is great! And so is Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly. But the person who really steals the spotlight it Catherine Zeta-Jones. Growing up with a musical background, she is perfect. Her dancing is just as good, but you need to see that on the silver screen. The best number (and longest) is Cell Bock Tango. Each woman is great and for once it doesn't sound out of sync. Finally, a recording of Chicago where the dancing is all you need and the voices .... A soundtrack where both the dancing and singing are a phenomenon!
B0000683DH|5.0|Wrath of Khan is still a great movie, no matter what. Chances are you already own this if you like Star Trek. If not, you might as well click the Buy Now button. Trust me. It's that good.<br />THE STORY:<br />The story is top notch, with Kirk facing off against his Arch-Enemy Khan who he defeated and marooned back in the Original Episode 'Space Seed.' Well, Khan is back, and that's good for us. I won't do into too much deatil, on the off chance you haven't seen it before, but trust me, it's a great story, and the movie is still very visually appealing, despite the fact that it's now over 20 years old. Even if you aren't a fan of Star Trek, you'll find yourself enjoying this movie. It's one of the best Sci-Fi movies, ranking up there with Bladerunner, Star Wars, etc.<br />THE DVD:<br />This DVD cleans up the footage, which is great because the previous non DE cut looked... well, not bad, but not all that great either. This one shows a remarkable improvement. It's not the greatest transfer you've ever seen, and you'll notice a bit of graininess on 52&quot; HDTV's and the like, but the color and clarity is a much welcome improvement overall. The colors in particular look much better. Khan boasts a lot of 'Red Alert' scenes, and sometimes you'd wish someone had told the director to tone down the use of that color, but it's too late now, I guess. The added scenes are nice, but one doesn't really work. In the scene where Kirk is showing Spock and Bones the Genesis Project video, they added a small scene. Listen closely. It's pretty noticable where they added in the new stuff. The rest of the new scenes work well, though there aren't as many as in ST:TMP DE. Speaking of the sound: It's great. They did a amazing job on WoK, and it shows... well, you know what I mean... The commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer is insightful, and Micheal Okula once again provides a text commentary, also insightful if you don't have the entire history of Star Trek commited to memory. (Beleive it or not, some of us DON'T.)<br />THE EXTRAS:<br />The bonus disk has a nice amount of interviews with the director, the stars and the crew. Mostly new stuff, but also some promo interviews from when the movie was released with Shatner, Deforest, Nimoy and Montalban. When you finish those, you'll find two behind the scenes features designing Khan and the visual effects and there is a feature on two of the writers of the Star Trek novels that tie in with the film. And, of course, the film trailer and a storyboard archive.<br />So anyway, like I said before, Buy it now if you don't already own it. It's the logical thing to do.e it or not, some of us DON'T.) <br />THE EXTRAS:<br />The bonus disk has a nice amount of interviews with the director, the stars and the crew.

B000083C49|1.0|Film reviewers often have one thing in common--stupid herd following. Witness their perennial crowing about this time travel debacle. As a Star Trek fan, I am horrified that they claim this as the best and most popular of the Trek films. First, real Trek fans hate this because: the time travel plot is mismanaged; the girl becomes the story's center,  without actually being important, interesting, or intriguing ; the whale phenomenon is left unexplained--and whales are never the subject of communication issues or any other Star Trek movies; its basically a Greenpeace movie--and all the shallowness of a political trumpeting is included; and their have been numerous episodes of the series, both original and subsequent spinoff shows, that handle time travel much better. There was a reason Nimoy was taken off the director's chair after this. Shatner's later attempt, The Final Fronttier, is not bad, certainly not as horrible as this. Critics just want a reason to bash the Canadian and what better way than saying the two movies his work is sandwhiched between are much superior? The best of the Star Trek lot were II and VI. The End. <br />  This movie has one funny line: Chekov, at the height of the cold war asking Americans in San Francisco: \\"Where are your nuclear vessiles [missles]?\\" I fell asleep after that. To rank the movies in order they are: II, VI, V, III, I, IV.  Thank you, Roman numerals.
B000050XXO|4.0|The DVD is still one of the best films ever made.  <br />The extras are what make this box set so unusual.  Original lobby cards are very rare and expensive to purchase so these provide a unique prospective.  The black and white photographs offer a behind-the-scenes look into a historical film, the one-sheet movie poster is in the box (as well as a free offer for an additional rolled one!) and the Senitype contains a film clip from the movie.  For me, it's like owning a true piece of Hollywood Glamour.

B00005JLD2|5.0|Ah, the arrogance of the white male is, at least historically, seemingly boundless. This profoundly affecting film tracks the capture of three half-caste aboriginal girls and the determination of Mr. Neville (head of the program to \\"educate and retrain\\" these children with the ultimate goal being the eradication of the non-white population) to get them back to the \\"school\\" for re-education. Referred to by all the aboriginals as Mr. Devil, Branagh gives a chilling performance, thin-lipped and brimming with self-righteousness--the classic do-gooder who is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he will go to any lengths to see it to fruition.<br />Inspiring and ultimately heartbreaking, this true tale of three small girls--led by 14-year-old indomitable Molly--determined to find their way home--twelve hundred miles of unforgiving terrain--is not to be missed. Restrained, exquisitely performed, and lyrically beautiful, it offers a piercing insight into the endless crimes committed against indigenous populations everywhere.<BR>My highest recommendation.
B00005JKJA|1.0|It started as a TV pilot.  Lynch apparently pasted together nearly 2 hours of miscellany from Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and Twin Peaks: Long, pointless (dreamlike) shots with low moaning backgroun noise/music; eccentric characters for the point of eccentricity; horrible dialogue; cute, guileless people naively dragged into a seamy other world; lip-synched saccharine 50s tunes; Roy Orbison tunes resurrected to portray deep anguish.  Absolutely nothing new or cohesive.<br />When it wasn't picked up, knowing that he never intended to reach closure on the story, he used the oldest trick in the book: aha! It's a dream sequence!  The last half-hour is interesting, but let's not fool ourselves.  This is a (mostly) good half-hour art movie, not a great 2-1/2 hour motion picture.
0375414053|2.0|As a new mother, I had looked forward to this book, thinking it would give me insight regarding how to balance work and motherhood. Instead, the main character spends most of her time complaining about having too much work, yet hating spending vacation time with her kids (who drive her crazy.)  The end was far fetched too.  I would not recommend this books for new mothers.
6305922756|5.0|Spinal Tap is one of the very funniest movies that I have ever seen.  Certainly, it is the funniest one that I can think of off the top of my head.  If you have not seen Spinal Tap you absolutely MUST watch it at least once.  The movie is an comedy classic.  If you have seen the movie before, and are wondering if the DVD extras are worth the price, wonder no more.  This is a definite must have.  <br />Most DVDs don't give you much in the way of extras, maybe a documentary and a trailer, if you're lucky.  The Spinal Tap DVD has an interview with Marti DeBergi, a bundle of ads, interviews with the band on television, and tons of deleted scenes.  Also, the DVD has a hysterical running comentary of the three leading band members.  The best part of the DVD is the commentary given by Guest, Shearer, and McKean in character--it's the band Spinal Tap watching the movie Spinal Tap, and giving their opinions of what you are seeing.  It's like getting twice the jokes in one movie. <br />To sum it up; I put off buying the DVD because it was a little more expensive than your average DVD, but when I finally caved I found that it was totally worth the extra cost.  Movies like this one are what make DVDs so great.
B00003CXI1|1.0|However artfully veiled it may be, it cannot be denied that this film is the next step in a government conspiracy to confuse America's youth into putty that the government can mold to it's will! They throw these dark references at the audiences, yet make light of it all. How can it be anything but an attempt to soften our youth up to the ideas that the government will be forcing upon them once they go into Phase Four of The Demosthenes Plan? Boycott this film or free speech and, dare I say it, free thought shall be destroyed!
0698119347|5.0|I just finished reviewing this book for my junior high students.  I found it to be quick moving and entertaining.  I am sure my junior high students will really enjoy this book. This is also a book I think a reluctant reader would enjoy. Anyone  who is a James Bond fan will enjoy this quick read.  The author did a great job.
0375414053|4.0|I liked this book, although I did expect a funnier, more Bridget-Jones type of book from all the rave reviews it has received... I think this book is something any mother can relate to -working or not. It really is about the struggle between being a good mother & trying to balance out every aspect of your life. Worth reading.
0446677450|5.0|I read Rich Dad Poor Dad -- by Kiyosaki, and contributor, Lechter -- in a day and a half!  I am no math genius -- in fact, due to a traumatic brain injury, my math skills were impaired.  However, after reading this book (about a year ago), I am still quoting from it in conversations anywhere from family dinners, discussions with &quot;experts&quot; on finance as well as business and social get -togethers.  What I have learned:  &quot;Anything that takes money out of your pocket is a liability.  Anything that puts money into your pocket is an assett.&quot;  And always keep assets higher than liabilities.  I never understood taxes, their effects, the economic cycles and tactics, bonds.....and I am still no expert....but - reading this book has made a person -- me -- who understood so little about finance -- financially literate.  And that is the whole key to the book...understanding as much as you can with expending as little as possible.  One may be surprised that &quot;study hard/go to school&quot; may not so much apply these days...but after reading this book, it is easier to understand how the &quot;C&quot; h.s student is a billionaire and how the &quot;A&quot; students from high school and college may not be in the best financial position.  This book gives anyone the inspiration to be wealthy -- not just in dollars, but also by increasing your (at least MY) financial and socio-economic knowledge!!

B00003CXCQ|5.0|Sometimes movies are labeled classic, and yet they date poorly. It isn't always the fault of the movie, but can be blamed on modern sensibilities.  Take a movie like THE LOST WEEKEND (about alcoholism).  It was a classic in its day due to its harrowing treatment of a subject that hadn't really been tackled by film up to that point.  But today, after dozens of TV movies on the subject, our ability to be moved by THE LOST WEEKEND is disappaited.  We have to tell ourselves as we watch it, &quot;Yeah, this is a classic.  Remember, this is the 1940s.  It must have been quite something.&quot;<br />SNOW WHITE is the opposite.  It is a classic, a charming classic, all on its own.  A delight from start to finish. And telling yourself, &quot;This was made 80 years ago,&quot; only enhances the experience.  All children MUST see this movie.  As a 39 year old man,  I'm hardly the audience for it, but WOW, it still holds up.  There is minimal dialogue on the movie, yet the antics with the dwarves are so charming and funny, you just can't help but smile.  And the creepy scenes really are creepy. <br />And you MUST own the DVD.  It is SO full of extras that you just won't see anywhere else.  Although perhaps not as mind-boggling as the extras of, say, LORD OF THE RINGS, the completeness is still pretty amazing.  This was the first movie to offer its extras in an organized manner, a &quot;tree&quot; of extras, if you will, and the DVD will be considered a classic too.
0064471837|5.0|I originly read this story, because I lost a bet with a friend, and she got to chose a book for me to read -- with out complaining.<br />I thought that it would be hard and that the book was terrible, but I was REALLY REALLY wrong.<br />The story was really good.  A little confusing at some parts, like when Sabrail travels into the realm of the Dead, and uses bells (I think!) to bring the dead back to life. But it's a really good adventure and fantasy book.<br />The main character, Sabrial is really interesting, and goes through a lot in the book, from saving people, to going into the realm of the dead to do so.  Her cat, Mogget, that helps her around abit if really funny and cool.  And her friend Touchstone (weird name, I know!) is kind of wimpy, but, hey, the more girl power, the better.<br />All together, this is a really good book, and if your looking for a good read, this is definatly it.

0066214122|2.0|I have been onboard with Crichton since Sphere came out many moons ago, but, sadly I am jumping off his bandwagon. I trudged through Airframe, Disclosure and Rising Sun to see if he would return to his own created genre. However, what original ideas he used to have are now becoming formulaic non-sense. Here is Crichton's formula - Research Obscure Technology + Find Worst Case Scenario + Have Technology Act Out Worst Case Scenario + Isolated Location (underwater, desert, medieval Europe, whatever)+ Ignorant Character and Children = brilliant novel, plus a script Spielburg will look at (crosses fingers). Can't wait to see him tackle the time-travel issue, oh he already did.  It was enjoyable in a mindless way, plus you get to feel smarter about yourself afterward. Anyway, I'm not expecting much from him next time and I'll wait for the paperback.
B00003CXAA|5.0|According to Bruce Reid, &quot;...our very own Shakespearean cycle...&quot;  This is very fitting and appropriate.  The Godfather films [yes, including Part III] are in a class with Euripides, Shakespeare, Goethe...<br />Regarding the DVD collection, the films look and sound remarkable.  The chapters are well divided, the menus are elegant and usable, the 4th [extra material] disc is indispensable.  What struck me as fascinating was how integral last minute script rewrites factored into these films.  One would think that every detail had been agonized over, every symbol considered and weighed.  Not so, many details were accidents or capricious anomalies that came together at the last moment.  For instance, in Part II, it's interesting to note that Brando was supposed to appear as the elder Vito just prior to Michael joining the army in WWII [when not flashing back to Deniro as Vito or forward to Michael's reign] but literally didn't show up to the filming, so the scene was rewritten to have Vito off-camera.  This type of thing always seemed so purposeful, but rather, is an example of how great creative endeavors tend to develop a life and mind of their own.<br />I really enjoyed the genealogical tree that showed all the birth/death dates of the Corleone family.  You can click on each name and it takes you to a summary page for each character.  I can honestly say that after watching these films countless times for twenty years, I really didn't fully understand all the in's and out's of the Godfather trilogy until I owned the DVD collection.<br />5/5
B00005A46T|5.0|From top to bottom this cd tops the first one. My favorite song is My Plague. But songs like left behind I ca relate to and keep metal the way it should be. Unlike Mudvayne who I think need to take a hint from Slipknot and go more in the same root but keep their own, Slipknot maintains your interest with even their slower songs with darker vocals. This is one of the best cds ever.

B00000FCBC|5.0|I dished out 30 bucks to purchase Garage Days Revisited imported from Japan along with some pathetic demos from the Black album.  I had a tape of the Garage days revisited back in high school and considered it a source of great pride to be on the \\"in\\" to even know of the existence of Garage Days.  To be a true fan, you had to know about Garage Days.  Then they went and made my 30$ investment obsolete by issuing a polished 2 disc set containing the Garage material.  I WAS .....  However, they made some pretty cool new material like whiskey in the jar and astronomy.  I can only hope that the tone of the collection of songs found here directs them in the future.  I love the blues, and I hope the passion for blues guitar remains on future work.  Well, I'm getting over my bitterness toward metallica by going and letting all their poser fans of the black/load/reload albums know about Garage Inc by covering a catchy Bob Seger tune and then cramming this stuff on disc two.  At least they named the album after the original garage stuff.  Hope you enjoy the garage work as much as I have, but I probably won't consider you a true fan... unless you had it before this two disc set and spent 30$ on it!

0671510991|5.0|Diplomacy by Henry Kissinger<br />Simon and Schuster, 1994<br />912 pages.<br /> In his capacity as both the National Security Advisor and as the Secretary of State for two different presidents Henry Kissinger redefined the nature and scope of American diplomacy.  He served in the most tumultuous administration of the twentieth century yet managed to invigorate foreign policy in what was also the nadir of executive prestige.  With Richard Nixon he formulated a grand strategy based on the twin principles of Wilsonian idealism and European realpolitik that led to a period of geopolitical stability in the midst of America's extrication from the Vietnam quagmire.  The Nixon-Kissinger team reshaped the nature of Soviet-American relations and introduced a period of d&eacute;tente using triangular diplomacy and the concept of linkage.  As both an academic and as a practitioner of the art, Kissinger describes in his book the evolution and philosophical heritage of American diplomacy and its impact on global and regional stability during its rapid ascendancy as a superpower in the twentieth century.  Kissinger provides both the casual reader and the foreign policy maven a refreshing history of American foreign policy as a reflection of its uniquely benign belief in its own exceptionalism.<br /> In Diplomacy Kissinger lists two primary schools of thought that govern the conduct and define the characteristics of foreign policy.  European diplomacy in its current form traces its roots to Cardinal Richelieu and the primacy of the state.  Raison d'etat radically altered international relations because it provided the philosophical justification towards the secularization of national interest.  No longer under the suffocating aegis of the church, nations shrugged off idealistic endeavors in favor of policies that provided tangible benefits.  The Treaty of Westphalia introduced the modern state system and ushered in a tumultuous period due to the lack of a confluence of common interests and a shared system of values in the concert of nations.  Following the chaos of the Napoleonic Wars Metternich presided over a period of relative stability in Europe by positioning the decaying Austrian Empire as the fulcrum of the European balance of power.  In his relentless pursuit towards the creation of a unified Germany, Bismarck dispensed with incremental gains and boldly asserted Prussian hegemony with a series of wars buttressed by peace settlements that consolidated his gains.  Bismarck unhinged the Vienna settlement and dealt the existing balance a mortal blow.  The cold calculus of raw power supplanted the Metternich consensus of legitimacy and in the wake of the entangling system of alliances that ensued, a European conflagration became almost inevitable.  Indeed the singular practice of realpolitik, Kissinger asserts, \\"turned on itself\\" .<br /> Whereas realpolitik was distilled from the crucible of armed conflict, Wilsonian idealism reflected the triumphs of democracy and manifest destiny, together with the unshakeable belief in the exportability of the uniquely American system of values.  While Kissinger lauds the style and substance of American diplomacy he nonetheless insists on the exercise of restraint governed by the realization of American national interest.  According to Kissinger the most successful American statesmen were those capable of blending Wilsonian idealism with realpolitik.  While Wilson provided the conceptual basis for American foreign policy in its ascendancy as a great power, he was unable to realize his objectives.  A generation later, Roosevelt, borrowing heavily from Wilson's Fourteen Points, co-authored the Atlantic Charter and provided the framework for the United Nations.  Roosevelt was successful because he possessed a surer grasp of the tenor of national consensus.  He advanced Wilson's idealism and accepted the responsibilities of great power status yet accepted the territorial aggrandizement of the Soviet Union.The nation that implemented the Marshall Plan and sponsored the economic recovery of its former enemies was the same nation that unleashed weapons of unprecedented destructiveness on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.<br /> Kissinger's analysis of American diplomacy during the Cold War is particularly noteworthy.  From the prescient George Kennan to the equally remarkable Ronald Reagan, Kissinger chronicles the evolution of American strategies of containment.  As a statesman he refrains from the insensitive criticism of an academic, and as an academic he bases his analysis on research rather than a political or personal agenda.  Kissinger traces the theoretical origins of Cold War diplomacy in the Truman administration through its first tests in Greece and Turkey and armed intervention in Korea.  He clarifies the persisting debate on Vietnam and rather than vilifying a single administration as is the popular pastime of many historians, he traces the efforts of four separate presidents and nearly twenty years of American involvement.  It is remarkable, however, that Kissinger merely brushes over an event as significant as the Cuban missile crisis.<br /> Although Kissinger devotes the majority of his book to American diplomacy, he evaluates the actions of both allies and adversaries and their respective impact on the geopolitical environment.  He supports Kennan's thesis that the collapse of the Soviet Union was inevitable but credits American diplomacy with limiting Soviet aggression and containing communist infiltration in regions vital to American interests.<br /> American diplomacy, Kissinger asserts, is the product of American exceptionalism and democratic necessity.  Lacking the unifying force of an opposing superpower, the United States may again fall victim to the siren song of isolationism.  Kissinger devotes the final pages of his book to a call for the development of a national interest.  National interest will undoubtedly combine elements of realpolitik and Wilsonian idealism and define limits in order to prevent the exhaustion of American will and an overextension of American capabilities.  National interest will also provide the requisites for unilateral action in a world increasingly suspicious of the military, economic, and cultural domination of the sole superpower.  The current outlook is not auspicious.  Western Europe, for the most part a steadfast ally during the Cold War, is breaking ranks and currently one of the most vociferous critics of American foreign policy.  Future administrations face new challenges in an increasingly complicated new world order where simple geopolitical calculations are rendered useless and threats to American security span continents in the form of decentralized terrorist cells.  However, America has answered challenges to the Wilsonian goals of peace, stability, progress, and freedom for mankind with resolve and moral conviction in the twentieth century.  And though it may be a \\"journey that has no end,\\"  Kissinger's faith in the purpose and goals of American diplomacy remains unshakable.that implemented the Marshall Plan and sponsored the economic recovery of its former enemies was the same nation that unleashed weapons of unprecedented destructiveness on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  <BR> Kissinger's analysis of American diplomacy during the Cold War is particularly noteworthy.

B00006LSM3|5.0|These days I have come to think better of George. Not George W. Bush. It's George Harrison. It's been about ten years after his previous works (\\"Cloud Nine\\" and the Traveling Wilburys' CDs). During these years I almost forgot him. So, \\"Brainwashed\\", his last CD, is a sweet surprise to me. His last songs didn't change so much, compared to his previous ones. But they're so beautiful and, at the same time, full of his philosophy and sense of justice. It's only George who sings DNA, faith, GCE, Nikkei, brainwashing, etc. on the beautiful guitar music.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|I won't repeat what other reviewers have said (and I wholeheartedly agree with them).  All I'll add is that the opening three tracks, in sequence: &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, and &quot;On and On and On&quot; are possibly the best opening trio of tracks of any album bar none, for sequencing, emotional breadth, musical breadth, and lyrical - ahem- dexterity.  <br />Super Trouper: Pure Pop, wonderful harmonies, all sorts of clever stuff going on in the arrangements (listen to the bass throughout this album), and the immortal opening couplet -- &quot;I was sick and tired of everything // when I called you last night from Glasgow&quot;<br />Winner Takes It All:  A masterpiece (one of the few songs that in my opinion does not make the transition to stage well in Mammia Mia).  Upbeat pace, but drenched with sadness -- this is the soundtrack to my memories of the summer of 1980.  Is it just me but has the vocal line been redubbed, from the ear-catching &quot;does he kiss you, like I used to kiss you&quot; to &quot;does She kiss you like I used to kiss you&quot;?  I don't believe my memory is playing tricks on me -- it was so blatant in the original and etched in the memory that Agnetha was singing Benny's (or was it Bjorn's) thoughts.  Even if that quirk has been dubbed out,  the song still has all its power.<br />On and On and On:  I loathed this when it first came out. Now I'm hooked into its hypnotic melody and rhythm.  Another classic couplet &quot;You said can we have some time for us // I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus.&quot;  Again, under the simple rhythm there are layers and layers of complexity and hooks in the arrangement.  Listen to the bass line and the various synth layers.<br />The rest of the album is very good, The Piper and Our Last Summer (brought to my attention by Mamma Mia) being my highlights.  However, for 12 minutes of pure pop perfection, the opening 3 cuts are as close as you'll get.
0385335482|4.0|When I first picked up this book I thought that Becky Bloomwood represented all of us in the \\"recreational shopper\\" category.  She loves clothing and makeup, cappuccinos and clearance sales.  A few pages into this hilarious and pitiful story, however, I realized exactly what Kinsella meant when she labeled her young, quirky lead a \\"shopaholic\\".  Ok, think \\"alcoholic\\", but replace the alcohol with leather boots, designer scarves and cashmere sweaters.   Becky's spending habitb are the culmination of a society that demands financial responsibility while showering its consumers with an overwhelming array of sale ad's, credit card offers and product displays.  So even while she's in debt up to her ears, avoiding over-due account notices and inventing excuses (such as her dog dying or her leg breaking) for late bank payments, she still can't get though one day without whipping out her Visa card and digging herself in deeper.   Sound sad?  Well, it gets better.  Becky is a financial journalist for a popular money magazine, writing articles to help people manage their personal funds.  No irony is lost in this story.<br />There's something so validating about a character that spews out in black-and-white what half of us think but can't admit.  \\"I honestly feel as though this piece of paper has nothing to do with me.  Perhaps, if I carelessly let [this bill] drop down on the floor behind my computer, it will disappear.  The cleaners will sweep it up and I can claim I never got it.  They can't charge me for a bill I never received, can they?\\"  Anyone who has ever anguished over their bulging credit account or fantasized about a computer glitch wiping the slate clean will feel a kinship with Becky, and anyone who hasn't will be humored by a glance inside this turmoil.<br />To fix her sticky situation Becky goes through a series of self-improvement adventures, each designed to either \\"make more money\\" or \\"cut back\\" her spending.  Of course she's doomed to repeat history no matter what idea she tries, and we, the readers, enjoy a good chuckle at her attempts.  <br />Every good story ends with a distinct feeling of closure, and Kinsella doesn't disappoint.  I'll admit I was afraid that Becky would find the easy way out (by winning the lottery or falling into a high-paying job), but the irony continues when a financial blunder she makes in the fourth chapter of the book turns out to be the story that brings her fame, financial freedom and a little romance.  <br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  The supporting characters are believable and detailed.  Kinsella gives no physical description of Becky at all, so I was able to plug in any features I wanted without feeling like I was messing up the character she intended.  I'm sticking with four stars for two reasons:  (1) It's pretty predictable for the most part.  There were a couple surprises for humor's sake that left me giggling, but as a whole we knew where this story was going.  (2) If you've read Bridget Jones's Diary then this story line will be strangely familiar.
B000001GQC|5.0|At first glance, Soviet music sung by a British Chorus and a Russian Mezzo, played by a British and an American orchestra, conducted by a German trained Italian seems too diverse to succeed, but this recording is not only a success, it's a great success.<br />Of the recordings on this disk, Alexander Nevsky and Lieutenant Kije both started life as score's for films by Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Faintsimmer respectively and both were later re-cast into the orchestral works contained on this CD. This is where the similarity ends. A great sense of fun pervades the music through Kije and is carried off with great aplomb by Abbado and his players. I still can't decide if I like this recording or Reiner's more, but both are equally good, so it's really a win - win situation, whatever your final choice. <br />Nevsky however is a very different piece, at the time when it was being written both Prokofiev and the film's director Eisenstein were seriously out of favour with Stalin, Khrennikov and the sham critics of the time, a poor reception for this film could well have seen both of them deported to a Siberian Gulag like so many millions of others and this sense of brooding fear and paranoia pervades the work, but they got lucky, Stalin liked the work and their fortunes revived because of it. Looking back to Nevsky's campaign of 1242, the piece also succeeds in capturing the atmosphere of the Soviet Union in 1938 and looks forward to the horrors that were to come in the years of war that followed. Yet despite this, it is a work of tremendous power and beauty, I have yet to hear the famous \\"Battle on Ice\\" performed with more power or \\"The Field of the Dead\\" sung so movingly. Elena Obratzova rises to the occasion magnificently. Let no one tell you that Jarvi or Previn's recordings are preferable to this one. <br />The Scythian Suite was commissioned by Sergei Diaghelev for his Ballet Russe and shows a young Prokofiev showing just what he was capable of. This work ranks with Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin as one of the most barbaric pieces of music ever written and Abbado gives it full voice in this breathtaking reading.
0783240236|5.0|As a young boy I watched \\"The Birds\\" for the first time. I found it deeply frightening and disturbing. I couldn't manage to find sleep what felt for ages. It took me a long time to dare a second look on the movie.     But this second look revealed to me a deep psychological drama between a overprotective mother and her female rival  (if you want to dig deeper into psychological details I recommend you to read Camille Paglias analysis of \\"The Birds\\"). Now I was not longer frightened but fascinated!     Take a close look at the scene in the restaurant when Mitch (The Boy) introduces the hurt Melanie (The Girl) to his mother (The Mother). All the characters and their relation to each other are revealed to us in a quick glance. Now that I think about it: Not only do we see Norman Bates stuffed birds killing people with their razor-sharp beaks instead of a knife, we also experience his mummified mother springing back to life. Boy, did Alfred have a problem with mother-figures (and birds)...    Also intriguing for me is the fact that there is no real music in the movie, just the electronic chirping and screaming of Oscar Salas Trautonium.    The birds are ART!
B00005MNP7|3.0|I was expecting more out of this ... have spun through it 3-4 times and nothing really catches my attention.  Her voice is in that &quot;in-between&quot; zone ... not that great, but nothing distinctive enough about it to make it appealing.
B00006LLNV|5.0|Elliot Goldenthal, the scorer of movies such as \\"Heat\\" and \\"Titus,\\" comes back with a brilliant blend of traditional Mexican and original latin music to go with one of the best movies of 2002: Julie Taymor's \\"Frida,\\" which earned him a Golden Globe this year. The soundtrack as a whole is simply outstanding, yet it has some peak moments: Lila Downs' performances, most specifically the opening track, 'Benediction and Dream,' the sexy tango 'Alcoba Azul' and the theme that plays during the closing titles, 'Burn it blue' which she performs with Brazilian super-star, Caetano Veloso. Also the rendition of \\"La Llorona\\" by Chavela Vargas is outstanding. The tracks that are part of his score work are also outstanding, and reminded me a lot of the music from the album \\"Ronroco\\" by Argentinian composer and producer, Gustavo Santaolallas. All in all, a very eclectic and hypnotizingly beautiful soundtrack with supreme good taste.
B00005YXZH|3.0|It's interesting how excited everybody is about this CD, I was somewhat neutral. It has some cool medium speed grooves and a casual grace not present on many albums. It also has some shamefully selfish musical noodles that meander along like a stoned folk singer who forgot he was recording. Those tracks are not entirely throw away; I kind of enjoy them in small servings. This CD is certainly worth owning and consistently delivers music (remember music, yeah they used to play music on the radio)
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am not a big fan of anime movies.....I do not know much  of the director or the makers of this film. <BR>What I can clearly tell you about this film is that...when I left the theatre....I had to ask myself....<BR>mmmm......where was I for the past couple of hours?<BR>It could have been my mood that day....but I doubt it.....<BR>I usually walk out on boring movies.....and sleep through the ones that make you think too much... (you know which ones I am talking about...)<BR>But spirited away literally took me away... I watched as my spirit was right there in that strange land with those strange characters...it almost felt like one of those very vivid and strange dreams you have as a child when you eat too much chocolate before bedtime...<BR>Am I making any sense here ? What I'm trying to say is:<BR>SPIRITED AWAY IS AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY(and/or)DREAM <BR>:::::especially for those who miss having a child's imagination.
B00004TEUX|5.0|There was a time when no collection of Classical Music (on LP at the time) was complete without these recordings.  I remember them being standard rainy Sunday afternoon fair at my grandparents house when I was a child.  Peter Maag's recordings of Mendelssohn's &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; and the Scottish Symphony are simply superlative.  46 years on, no interpretation has so captured the heart of the works and their romantic intentions as this one.  <br />The only problem is that the Hebrides Overture (&quot;Fingal's Cave&quot;) is not included on this issue, it is included on the Decca &quot;Classic Sound&quot; release, but with the excerpts of &quot;A Midsummer Nights Dream&quot; cut down to fit on the one CD. The issue you choose will depend on where your priorities lie, but what a pity both couldn't have been included on the same release even if it had to be stretched to a two-disc set.
B00005JM6E|5.0|If I only had 5 movies in a collection, this<br />would be one of them.<br />I am waiting for it to be released.
0786915749|5.0|This has been my first time out with a Dragonlance novel, and I couldn't be more pleased. I had tried to read this book months back, but couldn't get past the first page. I'm not sure why. But when I picked it up again just last week, I found myself reading beyond the first page. And I'm glad I did. It's great. At first, I thought maybe I was missing something; I felt that with each character that was introduced, I was supposed to know who they were - I thought maybe I had entered the middle of a series (my boyfriend later assured me that this WAS the book to start with, as far as all of the Dragonlance books that contain these characters). After I found that out, I enjoyed the book even more. I love a lot of the characters. Of course, Tasselhoff - the carefree kender - is my favorite, but I'm so intrigued with the mysterious Raistlin, that I can't wait to get onto the books in the series that are focused on him (the Twins series, and the Raistlin Chronicles). I haven't been this interested in a fantasy series since Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series (although, I can't seem to get past the third book with that one), but these are about half the size of those books, which is good. A lot of fantasy authors feel they need to go on for a thousand pages with lots of images and description, but so far, this one's just cutting to the chase. If you've ever seen the billions of Dragonlance books in a bookstore, want to read one, but don't know which one to pick up, I highly recommend this one. It is well-written, it's a good story, and it will make you want to run out and buy the rest in the series. It's definitely a great way to begin the Dragonlance series.
0316666343|5.0|5 stars  Enjoyable<br />From the moment I read the first page of this book I was captivated by the story and I had a hard time putting this book down.  I really loved the character of Susie and I thought the story was well written.  <br />When the book begins Susie is violently raped and murdered, she than narrates the story from heaven as she watches her family, friends and murderer go through life.  Susie watches her father's attempt to bring her murderer to justice, her sister live the life that she might have and the boy that she kissed go on with life.  I found myself crying at times and angry at others but most of all I thought this was an enjoyable book.  I look forward to reading more books by Alice Sebold and I intend to read her memoirs \\"Lucky\\"
B0000026NC|5.0|1. Excellent mixing of live album ever ! (much better than pulse).<BR>2. Best and great solo guitar on On the turning away, Time and   Confortably Numb, I can listen to it for more than 1,000 times! 5 stars rating of this album is for these best Gilmour's live guitar solo as I've heard! (which I could not find it on PULSE)<BR>Needless to say, The atmosphere of this live album is much better than PULSE.  Don't worry, just collect it (and buy video too if you could find it !)
0380002930|4.0|I ahve not read this book but I have read Redwall.<br />I also have heard many times that Watership Down is like Redwall so it has to be good. <br />READ REDWALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1558908455|4.0|This movie is your tipacal Quentin Tarantino type movie, only with a supernatural kind of vibe. This movie has everything from very disturbing violence to humor to cheesy vampire movie violence. Each actor played their charactor to perfection. George Clooney was both disturbing and funny at times and Harvey Keitel is the bomb in any kind of role he undertakes. This is a great movie but if you are a luster of hot women, like myself, then the whole movie is worth having because of Salma Hayek's stripper dance routine.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album is a rock and roll gem.  On my list of all time favorite albums, this ranks at #2.  Kurt Cobain's lyrics are witty and poetic, and the band's bass playing and drumming is downright superb.  When I first brought this album,I was afraid it wouldn't contain all the Nirvana songs I love and know by heart.  However, all my favorites, from Dumb to About a Girl, were on the album.  The previously unreleased song, You Know You're Right was a great bonus.<BR>I strongly, strongly recommend this rocking album.
0783240287|5.0|Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought that this version had strengths in the vocal area that other versions of the musical were sorely lacking in. While I never saw it personally, I have heard recordings of Laurie Beechman's performance as the Narrator, and I believe that she has a much beefier, full voice. This is the role of a story teller, and I think that Maria Friedman serves this purpose much better than almost all of the previous narrators. Of course, Donny Osmond is a wonderful Joseph. However, there are areas where he can do better. But, all in all, he did a great job, and I was very happy with his performance.<br />I think that this is a wonderful version of the musical. It is presented beautifully, and I don't at all think it is lacking vocally.
0345448898|5.0|As soon as I started to read this trilogy, I couldn't put it down! I recently finished the last installment, The Amber Spyglass, which I spent all of my free time reading. I highly suggest this book to any reader who likes mystery and fantasy books. My English teacher even suggested this book to my class for a project we will be doing, and she herself said she enjoyed Philip Pullmans other published works. So this book isn't just for young readers, but adults as well. However, these books do contain violence and the details are described in great detail, so very young readers should not pick this book up.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I was was not sure this album would meet up to my expectations of their previous album Agaetis Byrjun, and it did. It's quite different in that it feels more organic, and it is complex in ways that are often quite subtle. My first listen to this ()  was on a drive from Colorado Springs to Denver, it was beautiful , made me feel connected to the landscape and my surroundings. This album reminded me of why I fell in love with Sigur Ros in the first place. Everytime I listen to this album I hear it it new ways, and something else about it will fascinate me. I have heard that a video for Vaka (track 1) has been shot and I'm looking forward to seeing that as well.
B000005JA8|5.0|I'm a little baffled by the response on this site to this admittedly strange record.  It's not the many negative reviews; it's the almost unanimously negative response to the positive reviews.  I think I know why.  It's because an idea seems to have developed that only hip, with-it connoisseurs of esoteric art can appreciate Trout Mask Replica, and those who don't like it, just don't get it.  <br />Well, I'm here to tell you that there's nothing to \\"get\\"; there's no code that needs deciphering.  You're not hip if you like it and unhip if you don't.  Nobody \\"has to\\" or \\"ought to\\" or \\"should\\" like this record.  It's purely a matter of personal taste, in my opinion.  My own view is that it's quite original, that it generally holds together, has moments of sheer beauty, and is overall very enjoyable.  But that's just my opinion.  If folks find it unlistenable, I won't agree, but will certainly respect their view of things.  <br />Let's be clear about one thing: This isn't a Dadaist work, nor is it just weirdness for weirdness'sake, nor is it an Important Artistic Statement.  Nor is it part of any other movement.  That doesn't mean there are no antecedents:  As others have pointed out, the blues, beat poetry, and elements of free jazz all shine through.  But mainly, it comes pretty much straight out of the untamed musical genius that runs through that unique indivdual, Don Van Vliet.<br />What we have here is someone who's drunk on words (e.g., at the beginning of  \\"Pena,\\" after the band utters some repeated nonsense phrases, the Captain says under his breath, \\"Love that, I love those words\\") and likes to tell stories--some, albeit, very obscure (\\"Neon Meate Dreams of a Octafish,\\" \\"Pena,\\" Sugar 'n Spikes\\"); others, quite accessible (\\"Dachau Blues,\\" \\"China Pig,\\" \\"My Human Gets Me Blues,\\" \\"Veteran's Day Poppy\\") and set them in appropriate musical contexts.  Essentially, this is a playful record.  Strange, yes, but still playful.<br />The music often is raw, raucous, and seemingly disjointed (though after several listens, it starts to hold together and make more sense:  Case in point, \\"Dali's Car\\").  And Don Van Vliet's voice takes some getting used to (although, to these ears, he's a world-class blues singer, and gets lots of emotion when he needs it).  In short, if you can get on board with its aesthetic, Trout Mask Replica can be quite rewarding.  If not, that's OK too.  What if you don't think there's any legitimate aesthetic to get on board with?  That too is OK.  At least that's how I see it.
B0000025R3|5.0|In my opinion, this is the GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME.  Colin Hay's smooth vocals, Greg Ham's memorable saxaphone riffs, and the smooth blending of rock, reggae, and new wave music make this album a classic.  It also features some of Men At Work's most popular hits, such as Who Can It Be Now and Down Under.  This album has very diverse songs; the punk rock sound of Helpless Automatan, soulful reggae of Catch a Star, and the memorable Underground.  Do yourself a great favor, and buy this album.
B000000I3O|5.0|Collection I is one of the best punk albums ever recorded. I got into The Misfits from being a diehard fan of singer Glenn Danzig. Danzig has the most distinctive voice in all of punk rock. The Misfits have not only a punk following, but also a strong metal and goth following. I like about every other song here, my favorite being Die Die My Darling. The Misfits were unique in punk rock because of their campy B-horror lyrics and Halloween-year-round imagry. Gotta love the trademark devilock hair style, which I've tried myself. People asked me if I was going for that Dracula look. The Misfits are immortal. I would stay away from the new Misfits, as they lost Glenn Danzig's voice and the spirit just isn't there any more. Like most true early punk bands, these guys can barely play their instruments.
B00004X01U|5.0|What I like about Madonna is that all her albums have a different flavor. This one is like &quot;Ray of light&quot; electronica but it'S less &quot;heavy&quot;. She slows down a little bit.<BR>MUSIC: THe folllow-up single wih the killer bass line. A great dancetrack. I love it.<BR>IMPRESSIVE INSTANT: Computervoice with this one. You love it or you hate it. I think it's great. <BR>RUNAWAY LOVER: Even though it's a dance track the lyrics are kind of sad and philosophical.<BR>I DESERVE IT: This syntie-folk song could be dedicated to her husband. It's my favourite on the album.<BR>AMAZING: It's true that it sounds like &quot;Beautful stranger&quot; but that doesn't have to mean that it's bad although it's not as good.<BR>NOBODY'S PERFECT: This song is really sarcastic. A message to the critics and the press but I don't like it. It has such a strange sound.<BR>DON'T TELL ME: Madonna goes country. Nice experiment but this shouldn't have been a single.<BR>WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL: A nice radio friendly popsong. I like it.<BR>PARADISE: This song sounds depressing. She doesn't sing much she talks in english and in French (Her french is just bad). Ovetall it's a good melancholic ballad but none of my favourites.<BR>GONE: A nice way to end the album is this syntie-ballad It's very relaxt but not as depressing as &quot;Paradise&quot;
B000000OR9|5.0|Well what can I say. Amazing rock album. First time I laid hands on this gem was in Baghdad, Iraq where big bands .like GnR, Europe and Skid Row where kickin. But it was those bands that not everyone heard about that attracted me. Bands like Giant, Damn Yankees, XYZ. When I moved to Aus no one had an Idea who Blue Murder was. 13 years later some people now recognise John Sykes name because of the movie Rockstar. It took me 12 years to get my hand on the CD which I found in a CD record shop in Singapore. I couldnt believe I found this baby after all these years. Billy kicks butts and. 15 out 5 stars. Play it as loud as u can and go back down memory lane to those great HR days.
B000002J29|5.0|In what could be one of the best live albums of all time, Genesis (sans Peter Gabriel) pulls out all the stops with their 1977 double-CD live release \\"Seconds Out.\\" Just a side note here, but the phrase \\"seconds out\\" is a boxing term meaning the break between rounds has ended. Interesting that they titled this album, which packs one helluva punch, that.<br />Anyway, the album kicks off with an excellent version of \\"Squonk,\\" and although somewhat similar and yet very different than the album version, the boys wrap up the tune about a fictional, furry little creature with a sweet little coda. \\"Carpet Crawlers,\\" or \\"The Carpet Crawl,\\" is next, and although no version of this song can match the power of the version on \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" it's still very nicely done. The only thing I don't like is that the entire first verse of the song is omitted, starting with the lyric \\"The crawlers cover the floor ...\\" instead of the original \\"There is lamb's wool under my naked feet ...\\" Why not just sing the entire song, Phil?! \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\" follows, and while this song doesn't seem to be a favorite amongst Genesis fans, it is one of my all-time sleeper favorites. The version here is insane, with what is seemingly an even quicker tempo than the \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" version. \\"Afterglow\\" is just that, \\"Afterglow.\\" Nothing too special or different than the album version.<br />Now here start to come the real treats on this record. \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" starts off without the piano solo that accompanies it on the \\"Selling England ...\\" record. In my opinion I think it's better this way. As you go through the song, Hackett and Rutherford remind the listener with their guitars that it's one of the most powerful pieces Genesis ever composed. At times they almost sound eerie and frightening. Then comes the lawnmower of \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe).\\" From what I've seen, they usually encored with this number on the 1976 and 1977 tours and this is probably thereason they stretched it out to over eight minutes long! The instrumental section is great, complete with crowd chanting and a brief \\"Stagnation\\" jam. Next is \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway,\\" which I honestly think could have been done a lot better than the effort here. Phil is too lounge lizard-ish in his vocal stylings for this one, and Tony using the synthesizer to recreate the piano introduction just doesn't cut it. They should have splurged for the baby grand on stage. However, by the end of the tune it segues very nicely into \\"The Musical Box\\" reprise, beginning with the \\"She's a lady\\" lyric. This is a great version of the \\"Box\\" conclusion, and will literally bring chills up and down your spine. The progressive rock power chords at the end are very loud and beautifully majestic.<br />Disc Two brings us the band's epic \\"Supper's Ready.\\" If you've never heard this song you must give it at least a couple of listens. Phil does a tremendous job with the vocals, especially during the final section, \\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs.\\" He also even helps out on the drums for \\"Apocalypse In 9/8,\\" which in my opinion is one of the best pieces of music ever written (it's also probably one of the most difficult songs in the world to play). \\"Cinema Show\\" is great, so great, dare I say, that it is superior to the \\"Selling England ...\\" version. Like \\"Squonk,\\" it also is given a cute little instrumental coda to wrap the song up into a nice long 11-minute package. Finally we get to \\"Dance On A Volcano,\\" one of the best post-Gabriel songs the group ever penned. It literally is explosive, especially during the intro, and even includes nearly frantic screaming by Phil. This leads into a little drum solo that brings us to \\"Los Endos,\\" an instrumental jam that reprises some sections of \\"Volcano\\" and \\"Squonk.\\" It is a perfect way to climax one of the best live albums in musical history. Afterwards we can then hear Ethel Mermen (spelling?) singing \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" over the PA and the french crowd chanting \\"Un Autre\\" (translation: \\"Encore!\\").<br />If you were to buy only two Genesis albums in your lifetime, \\"Seconds Out\\" and the Gabriel epic \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" would be the two you'd want to get. That is, unless you're an \\"Invisible Touch\\" fan.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I have always thought that Dream Theater were an incredible band and that Metropolis Part 2, while not being my personal favourite of theirs, was a very good album. But watching this they have impressed me even more. Simply looking at either John Petrucci's, John Myung's or Jordan Rudess' hands when they play is mind blowing, and I will admit now I've seen him play that I have never given bass player Myung the credit he deserves.<br />The songs also come together very well live, putting out an incredible energy that was almost absent from the original studio recordings (therefore I recommend buying the studio album before this or the live album Live Scenes From New York so that it can be truly appreciated for what it is). LaBrie also comes across very well live, even if he does look kinda funny sometimes (he's not as thin as he used to be which makes those spunky leather trousers look all the more comical). And Mike Portnoy is simply fantastic. Those fills he does near the end of Finally Free are mindblowing.<br />Not only do you get the entire Scenes From A Memory live, but you're also given live performances of A Mind Beside Itself (Erotomania, Voices and Silent Man) from Awake, Learning To Live from Images And Words the mighty 25 minute long Change Of Seasons. On top of that there is also commentry from the band which can run throughout the entire performance when turned on. This is especially interesting for 2 reasons - firstly it is excellent at telling the story (which is considerably more intricate than I realised) and secondly I discovered that Petrucci's name is pronounced Petruchee. Now isn't that interesting? ;-) Add to that a photo gallery with some very cool backing music (some of which resembles Caught In A Web from Awake and New Millenium from Falling Into Infinity but some of which I don't recognise) and a brief documentary on the band live.<br />The only drawback is that the effects and patterns and some of the filmed storyline incorporated into the edit are a bit unprofessional. However, I'm still going to give this a full five because it is so good in every other respect that they are overlooked (at least the first few times of watching it) due to everything else being so incredible. This is an absolutely essential purchase for any Dream Theater fan with a DVD player.edit are a bit unprofessional.

B00006RIO7|5.0|I have never seen Chicago on the stage but I like the musicals from MGM and anything else musical. I went to the theather to see Richard, Catherine and Renee and I LOVED IT. I went twice in the first week and Bugged my brother singing what I could remember from the movie and bought the CD as soon as possible. Its great and better now that Richard and Renee got Golden Globes.  BUY the cd anywhere you can....Oh Chicago starts at the cinema in 20 mins GOT TO GO.................
0312305060|3.0|Mrs. Dalloway is an experimental, modernist novel that is very much of its time (think Gertrude Stein, James Joyce) -- no one would publish it today. Its chronology bounces around freely, and it tells two stories at once that never intersect (the other being about Septimus, the shell-shocked vet who is being taken to the doctor by his Italian wife), with the exception of one brief moment where both characters observe the same airplane passing overhead. It's not an easy novel to read, but it is a rewarding one. Cunningham's novel The Hours IS the kind of novel that can get published today -- it references the more interesting original, but isn't remotely as challenging, or engaging. The whole thing struck me as an academic exercise, and written in present tense with a dying-of-AIDS poet, well, it's just a little too calculated. It's depressing to see art eat its own head this way -- movies are all remakes of other movies, or make fun of other movies (Austin Powers), music recycles styles every couple of years, and now books are following suit. I'm not sure why no one was outraged -- remember The Wind Done Gone? What's the difference? He's just piggybacking on an already successful title. Cunningham is a good writer, but he certainly gets no points from me for originality with this one. Too easy. And when he includes actual excerpts from Woolf's prose, it's like parking a beautiful old Jaguar next to a Ford Focus.
B00005JLRR|3.0|Unfortunately not the greatest Star Trek movie, in fact of the 10 Trek movies i'd rank it #7. There are too many similarities with other movies i.e a madman with a doomsday weapon (see also The Wrath of Khan et al)a main character sacrificing himself (ditto spock in The wrath of Khan), the Enterprise getting beat up (virtualy every film)a countdown to the launch of the weapon (Insurrection, Khan) and so on. A pity and i felt let down. If this is the last Trek movie i won't be sorry.<br />My top 10 Treks:<BR>1. The Wrath of Khan<BR>2. Final Contact<BR>3. The Voyage Home<BR>4. The Unknown Country<BR>5.

0783225857|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, then you should.  And if you haven't read the book, you should.  Rarely has a great classic of literature been so perfectly cast and so perfectly transformed to screen.  Harper Lee's nostalgic look at life in 1930's Alabama is a lazy walk in yesteryear that somehow gets hold of you and has you on the edge of your seat.  I read the book and watch the movie at least once a year and I still love it.  The characterizations were perfectly done in the book and very well imitated in the movie.  Gregory Peck makes the perfect Atticus and you are amazed at how well the children played the parts.  You'll laugh as the children try to figure out how to get reclusive &quot;Boo&quot; Radley out of his house (leave a trail of lemon drops and he'll follow it, eating them) or get a message in to him (put a note on the end of a fishing pole).  Yet you find yourself crying when you realize how much he must have loved them and tried to protect them.  Interwoven in all this is the story of racial prejudice in the old south and it's effect on the children, their father and the town. It's a powerful story in a slow, summer-in-the-south kind of way.  Definitely a keeper!
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD features all the songs from the hit season 6 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; and if you're a Buffy fan - you should definitely buy this CD!! <br />It's a wonderful CD that you can listen to over and over and it has a song for every music taste!! James Marsters (Spike) does a wonderful job of Rest In Peace wihch has a Billy Idol/rock feel to it while Amber Benson (Tara) has the most beautiful voice out of everyone and sings Under Your Spell, a haunting love song with great lyrics!! Joss Whedon wrote all of the songs (creator of Buffy) and they're all great pieces to listen to! <br />I have some doubts over whether a non-Buffy fan would enjoy this CD but if you like musicals, and you've seen the episode, you'll be able to tell from the songs if you want the CD or not! I would recommend this CD to ALL Buffy fans and gutzy musical fans that want to try something new!!
B00005JKZT|4.0|Excellent sequel much better than the first film in my opinion. It's a pity we have to wait another year for the final part. <br />The SFX in the movie are in a different dimension, far better than the last Star Wars.<br />The only fault with the movie (as in the book) is that too many characters are wandering around in search of a plot, seemingly waiting for part three i.e the duo up the tree for most of the movie. Great stuff
B000002L1L|5.0|The first time I heard The Battle Rages On album was back in the summer of 1993 and I thought it was harder and more intense than anything out there in the music business. It was also a very strong collection of tunes. From all the reviews I've read on Amazon.com and DP websites, there are at least 6 songs that get a lot of votes of praise. The title track, Anya, Solitaire, Time To Kill, Ramshackle Man and A Twist In The Tale. Also, one of my faves is \\"A Nasty Piece Of Work\\". With so many good songs on one album it has to be a terrific CD. The one thing I could criticize is the mix (production) could probably be a hair better. For example, Gillan's vocals could be a hair louder, Glover's bass could use more presence. I think all 3 of the classic line up \\"reunion\\" albums (1984's Perfect Strangers, 1987's The House Of Blue Light, and The Battle Rages On) could use a re-mix to sound more 21st century. DPAS might consider remixing these great albums. With all that being said it's still a real good album not to be missed.
0553582445|4.0|I always get excited when I have a new Robin Hobb to read.  This is exciting, filled with emotion, action and rich detail.  A great addition to the world of the Farseers and Liveships, and it's great to see the series converging.
B00005KARK|2.0|I was shocked that Disney would make such a horrible movie for children.  It is loaded with social and cultural stereotypes and constantly shows animals caged, doors slamming on animals, and even shows the ringmaster whipping Dumbo's mother with a large black whip. My two-year old was very scared. More than that, I was offened by the song \\"Roustabouts\\".  The men who put up the circus tent at night sing this song.  First of all,  they are all black men putting up the tent.  If you listen to the words of the song, they are singing about \\" we don't read or write\\" and \\"when we get our pay we throw our pay away.\\" Also, the black crows in the movie clearly have black accents.  I know my two-year old doen't pick up on this, but I don't want her watching this kinds of movie over and over again. The only saving grace in this video is the loving relationship between Dumbo and his mother.  I don't like this video and am VERY sorry that I bought it.  A big disappointment Disney!
B00004YX0R|5.0|The Talich Quartet on the Calliope label play the Beethoven quartets with that distinguished old-world charm, full of warmth and relaxation, neatly unfussy and memorable by the radiant tone to which this ensemble has the solution. (Also read my fellow reviews appraisal.) The early quartets I enjoyed perhaps the most. They play all six quartets (Opus 18 no. 1-6) like they were just sitting around a fire place making music for the love of music. This can be said of all sixteen quartets really. The middle quartets (Op. 59 no. 1-3, Op. 74, Op. 95) hold up well against a lot of classic and modern versions, including the Vegh, Guarneri, Italian, Budapest and Emerson Quartets. I really thought the Talich version of Opus 59 no. 2 was perhaps the best I`ve ever heard. The late quartet performances (Op. 127, 130, 131, 132, 133 and 135) are fabulous as well, holding their own against the Busch, Budapest, Vegh, Guarneri, Italian, etc. The recordings are captured in a very fine, logically balanced analog recording. Finally, I wouldn't give up my other sets for only these interpretations, BUT if I were on that infamous desert island and could only have this set, I would be extremely happy to live out my days with this one.
0380789035|3.0|People had been raving to me about this book for years, so I finally tried it.  These themes have been well-trodden for many years, and I honestly think they've been handled better elsewhere.  Tim Powers has played with similar themes (notably in his creepy Declare) and the result was incredibly compelling.  I even found myself comparing this book to Adams' The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, and preferring Adams' take on Odin. It's not that the book isn't well written..it is, and it's fun identifying the various gods, but it all seems too familiar to me.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I read Cameron Crowe's Fast Times at Ridgemont High when I was in High school, and this was at a time when I usually didn't read books.  It flowed very easily and told a good story.  This can also be said of Almost Famous. <br />The Director's edition is worth the extra money.  It has the theatrical version as well as an extended Director's cut, which I found worthwhile.  They're both good movies, but the director's cut spends more character time and I like the characters enough that I will probably watch the longer version by default.  <br />This one lives up to the billing as a Special Edition.  It not only has two versions, but great commentary by Crowe and his actual mother.  Crowe's mother only had one criticism of the mother character in the movie, and it was surprising what she chose to dislike.   <br />Other extras include Cameron's picks as top of albums of 1973, some short vintage interviews with Lester Bangs, a CD of Stillwater music, some rehearsal footage and other tidbits.
B00005B36H|5.0|The First thing that i will say is that Tool is not a band to be compared to others.  They have created their own sound that is so unique that it is virtually impossible to catogorize them.  Each album that they have produced has their own unique sound so by saying Undertow is better or sounds different than Aenima or vice versa is pointless because Tool doesn't want each album to sound the same.  Opiate was produced during the Alt/Grunge period so it has a grungy sound to it, Undertow was released during the same time and proved that Tool would be a main stay and that heavy metal will still exsist. Aenima has a muddy production which created the dark metal sound that Tool trademarked and Lateralus has pushed each member to their musical limits and created a sound that once again could not be catagorized by one term.  I think that Lateralus falls somewhere into the progressive Metal area.  But whatever you may think, Lateralus is another great album and It was worth the wait.  The album as a whole is amazing and each song is unique to the other.  This album proves that Tool has a spectacular rhythm section with Danny Carey and Justin Chancellor.  Adam Jones guitar work is great again and of course Maynard has his unique howl.  Overall, just like all of Tools music, this album is great.  I will end with one warning: Tool's music (Lateralus, especially) is not easy to understand through just one sitting.  To truly understand and appreciate their music, one must take time and absorb Tool messages, complexity and musicainship.  Their music will take you where you want it to.

1573301183|5.0|This DVD is simply the Best! I watch it once a week at least. If you are a fan of AIC/Mad Season or a Grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden) fan this is a MUST own. The people who where there live to see this show have a great memory that should last a life time. They start off with the song \\"Nutshell\\" and play all their top songs along with many songs that lesser fans may not know as well. They end with a song they wrote the words to right before the show called \\"Killer is Me\\". The lyrics are deep the melody is haunting which makes for a killer combo. Lanyes voice was fantastic, and the DVD even has some funny parts when Layne sings the wrong verse to \\"Sludge Factory\\", or when Jerry ad libs some country lyrics. This is a Great DVD!  RIP LAYNE.

B000000H3Z|5.0|After 4 years worth of demos and one LP (1987's sludgy SCHIZOPHRENIA), the Brazillian quartet finally developed their sound with this masterpiece. Whilst previous releases were somewhat sloppy and incoherent and poorly recorded, BTR is where they hit the nail on the head. The potential they showed earlier all came together here and the result was an often overlooked heavy metal classic. With lyrics about militant social commentary, fast drumming, thunderous riffs, and Max Cavalera's aggressive growling, BTR is heavy, but in an intelligent way. The band also has a sense of melody and atmosphere, shown especially in &quot;Mass Hypnosis&quot; with the middle section containing a booming chorus effect, and Andreas Kisser's passionate guitar solos. The acoustic intro to the violent title track, as well as the ending to &quot;Stronger Than Hate&quot; also shows the band's more softer and melodic side.<BR><BR>If you can only buy one Sepultura album,make it this one. They never topped this one, despite the fact that they expanded their sound in subsequent albums. Beneath the Remains is THE album to define Sepultura, and the thrash metal genre in general.
B00006YXEK|4.0|Oh, that the world will hear this music and start thinking again. Well, one can hope.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is a lot like Saving Private Ryan in the fact that all Americans should be required to watch it.  This is another movie that will show the types of sacrifices that our men and women in uniform have to make, and will remind us all that they choose to serve for us...<BR>This is a well made movie, with a great cast.  The scenery and special effects are incredible, and the story line is top notch.  This movie actually made me cry.  Maybe that is because I am such a patriot, or maybe it is because of the things that the people that this movie is about went through.  The real men that were there that day in Somalia were true heros, and this movie does an excellent job showing that.  This is especially obvious when the men are trying to retreive the bodies of their brothers from the crashed Blackhawk while taking intense enemy fire.  No one was left behind, and after seeing this movie, it is pretty clear why two men were awarded the Medal of Honor for action that day.<BR>Great movie, very moving.  A must see!
B00006F83Y|2.0|This album follows the same formula used on the previous two albums - throw in 2 or 3 (at most) good songs and stuff the rest of the album with fillers.<br />The song &quot;No One Knows&quot; is the single, and with good reason - there's nothing else ANYWHERE NEAR as good on the rest of the album. The only ones that come even remotely close are &quot;Hangin' Tree&quot; and &quot;Another Love Song&quot;, and they are very different musically.<br />The instrumentation is exceptional but where are the decent tunes guys? I'm not a fan of disjointed, droning melodies and chord progressions.<br />As I said earlier, they are capable of pulling off two or three mind-blowers on each album. The talent is there - so why don't they start using it? I'm very disappointed (again).
B00003CX5P|5.0|A lot of people told me that this movie was not all that good, but I watched it anyway.  I have to say that I think that the dissenters are wrong, this is a good movie.  Besides just being a great DVD because of the great scenes, music, and special effects, this movie really has a good story in my opinion.  And if you have a kickin' home theatre set up (subwoofer required) then this movie is a must-have.  Crank up the volume and this one will blow the roof off your house!<BR>This movie is not like the last 3 in the series, and I think that is why some die-hard fans did not like it, but it is still a winner.  I know that some people said that they did not like the movie because of Jar-Jar Binks, and that is just silly.  He is only one little bit of the movie- get over it!<BR>This is a winner, buy it today.
0783230710|5.0|Apollo 13 is one of the better movies that Tom Hanks stars in.  The movie depicts the steps going into, and coming out of, the Apollo 13 mission.  The movie begins as any normal movie, but adds the twist of suspense and drama that is really hard to find in any movie.  As in the real-life version of the mission, when NASA was running the Apollo Moon missions, the explosion that crippled their only hope for space survival, down to the improvisation of manuevers to get the three astronauts home, down to the T.  I rate this movie with 5 stars, for its drama and suspense scenes, and 5 stars for the director, for putting together such a great movie.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is the greatest American film ever made, as entertaining as it is revolutionary.<br />When it was made, Orson Welles tackled a seemingly simple topic, a reflection back on a dead man's search for love and happiness in his life, and made a film that's epic in scope, gorgeous in its visual execution, brilliantly written, incredibly acted.<br />All in all, it's inspiring to filmmakers looking for a great debut film from a new director. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; also works for regular moviegoers just looking for a good drama.<br />Using interviews with all his closest friends and colleagues, Welles uses flashback to create a portrait of the life of millionaire media magnate Charles Foster Kane. Kane was, in conflicting accounts of those who knew him, a man of great character and potential or a wealthy, cold, manipulative scoundrel.<br />What, if anything, can be learned about the man from his last word? What does &quot;Rosebud&quot; mean?<br />The answer makes for good mystery, and it leads the viewer to ask key questions about what defines our lives and gives them meaning.<br />This film is fantastic, one that should be watched once a year to help you keep perspective on life.
6305558167|1.0|I'm sorry. I've read past reviews and know most people think this is one of the the greatest Arthurian movies out there, but I totally disagree. I have no idea what you were watching, but what I saw definitely did not resemble a \\"masterpiece\\" at all! <br />The portrayals of the characters were all wrong too! Merlin seems to be some weird mix of a character, although I agree he was the best actor in the movie. There is nothing in the movie to tell you that he is Arthur's mentor and true friend and one of the best and greatest influences in Arthur's life. <br />Arthur just did not look or act like a king, nothing at all like I imagined him to be. It's horrible how they skimped on showing Arthur's childhood and his maturity into kinghood. They don't show how just and kind and compassionate he was. He was a great king, loved and respected by all. Even his biggest folly, the incestuous relationship with Morgana (resulting in Mordred), was portrayed completely wrong. All you saw of him was him running around fighting aimlessly in needless battle scenes. <br />Who in the world thought up Igraine's character? She was more like a harlot, dancing the way she did in her opening scene, than the respectable wife of the Duke of Cornwall. <br />Lancelot pops in and out of the movie so randomly, you begin to wonder how important he really is to the overall storyline. How can you even tell he is Arthur's best friend, his greatest knight, his most trusted companion? Lancelot's character is one of the most complex, most fascinating characters ever, and it irritates me to no end to see him narrowed down to this one-dimensional character. All you see of him is that he \\"loves\\" Guinevere and is a great fighter. Nothing about his inner struggles to live up to everyone's expectations, or the struggle between his love for Guinevere and his love and loyalty for Arthur.<br />Guinevere is Guinevere, but there is no reasoning behind her and Lancelot having their affair, other than the fact thatit is universally known that she cheats on Arthur with Lancelot. And there's no explaining why even that's important to the story of Arthur's downfall.<br />Morgana's character has been interpreted many different ways, but blond? And I don't think I ever read a version where she and Merlin work together to learn their cheesy magic tricks. Mordred was perfectly arrogant and spoiled, but he was so one-dimensional. <br />Don't get me started on the story of the quest for the Holy Grail. That was just plain wrong. No mention of Galahad, who was the one to find the grail, or the significance of the Quest. <br />The only redeeming quality of this movie was the musical score. But since they did not compose any of the music, I can't give them too much credit. <br />So all in all, I didn't like this movie. It was utterly disappointing, nothing at all like what I've read. I do NOT recommend this movie. I suggest you go out and buy a book, any book, relating to the Arthurian legends. Anything is preferable to watching this movie.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|\\"Donnie Darko,\\" with a DVD chock full of interesting extras, is a surprisingly good, creepy little period movie. (Of course, the movie's set in 1988, and its soundtrack, featuring a lot of Tears for Fears music is killer.)<br />In the film itself, Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the great new young actors, gives a performance that stays both vulnerable and frightening as the title character, a disturbed boy seeing a psychologist because he sleepwalks, remains disdainful of his parents (who consider him \\"changed\\" even before the freaky events of the plot happen) and visualizes, at times, a giant bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him the end of his world is coming in less than a month.<br />Around the time he begins seeing Frank, Donnie's house is hit with a piece of airplane fuselage, which destroys his bedroom. The wreckage is unidentified, for no plane at the time reported losing any of its equipment.<br />At Donnie's school, the staff and students have become involved with an inspirational speaker's new program involving a narrow scope of emotional honesty. Donnie, seeing all as hypocrites, is encouraged to rebel violently by Frank, but Donnie also begins to piece together clues regarding hidden secrets, an uncertain future and, strangely, time travel that hint that Frank may not be all that he seems.<br />All of this leads to an ending that, more or less, makes sense and remains haunting, though it takes multiple viewings to quite \\"get\\" the film and Donnie's choices at its end.<br />Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore, who also served as a producer on the film, are on hand to give key performances. But the movie belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal. His nuanced performance gives the movie its creepy center.

B00006ADFL|5.0|Taking place in the 1950's in Christchurch New Zealand. Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story about the intense bond of two girls Pauline Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme.<br />I think for Pauline in particular this friendship is very important. Pauline is moody person, an introvert of very strong character, kind of a tom boy, with short black unruly curls.<BR>Her father runs a fish shop, and her mother is a house wife, their working-class home also doubles as a boarding house. <BR>She may have feelings of inadequetcy, because of scars on her legs, leaving them brittle, from a childhood illness. But when she meets Juliet Hulme it seems she's met her soul mate.  <br />Juliet is an extrovert, worldly and outspoken, she even corrects the French teacher on her first day.<br />Juliet is impressed with Pauline's scars, she has scars too, on her lungs from a childhood bout with tuberculosis.<br />Juliet's parents left her in the Bahamas &quot;for the good of her health&quot; and she didn't see them for five whole years. Juliet tells Pauline &quot;All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases, it's all frightfully romantic!&quot;<br />Pauline finds refuge at Juliet's enormous upper-class house, where they play and obsess in their made-up world of Borovnia, they write about the escapades of their imaginary alter egos and their fantasy family. Juliet becomes Deborah and Pauline becomes Gina (a beautiful gypsy). and they revel in the music of Mario Lanza, the worlds greatest tenor! <br />But Juliets parents seem rather cold and aloof. Her mother is a marriage counselor, she has a special technique called &quot;deep therapy&quot;.<BR>And her father is an esteemed University rector. He is the first to question the intensity of Pauline and Juliet's relationship. He suggests to the Riepers that Pauline may be growing in a &quot;wayward&quot; fashion and suggests a psychiatrist.<br />However, Pauline seems oblivious to this. She thinks of Mr. Hulme. as the kindest man she's ever known.<BR>Pauline begins to grow desperate, at the idea that someone may try to come in between her and Juliet, particularly her mother. Who seems to grow concerned at Pauline's total obsession with her stories (and uninterest in school) and especially after a short affair with a male boarder, their relationship is rocky.<br />Whereas Pauline truly has loving parents, her friendship with Juliet is so important to her, it seems to have altered her reality. And the tension builds when Juliet's parrents announce they are getting divorced and Mr. Hulme is taking Juliet and her brother to South Africa.<br />The story is absolutely true.<BR>The narration of the film was taken directly from the actual diaries entries of Pauline, which was discovered buried in her backyard by the police. And Peter Jackson, said he filmed most of the scenes in the actual location of the real events. <BR>Melanie Lynsky who portrays Pauline, is MAGNIFICENT! Her performance in fantastic, and seems so real.<BR>Those scenes in which she cries, are so excruiating to watch, because she's actually sobbing, and at the same time it's just facinating.<BR>She's also very charming. I think you'll like her right away. <BR>Kate Winslet is also wonderful. This must have been he first film for each of them, because in the opening sequence is says &quot;and introducing Melanie Lynsky &amp; Kate Winslet&quot;<br />Filmed in Christchurch New Zealand, Heavenly Creatures is a FACINATING and an absolutely ENGROSSING film. If you like movie of &quot;dark&quot; genre, you'll be awe-struck.<br />As an interesting side note, The girls were spared harsh punishment because of their ages. Juliet Hulme, changed her name to Anne Perry and is now a writer (of fictional crime) Anne Perry herself admits this. There has been speculation as to what has become of Pauline. But one source says, she changed her name to Hilary Nathan and is an ex-librarian, devout Catholic (almost became a nun) and now runs a riding schoolin rural England. This is from NZ (New Zealand) Woman's Weekly magazine 1997 in an article written by Chris Cooke.<br />This is an excellent film, and I'm glad to see it's now on DVD, I know there was a petition going around to get it released, I signed it. :-)<BR>This is the Uncut version.
0195145925|4.0|Give Mr. Barbour a break--he's British and doesn't speak like we do.  Perhaps this is why my compatriates are having such a difficult time processing this book.  This book is not easy!!  It requires time and effort.  It is not a light read.  I see that many reviewers are frustrated.  Part of this frustration is due to the resistance to accepting and entertaining living in a timeless universe.  One reviewer was correct in pointing out that Barbour does very little to reconcile our conventional sense of time with his timelessness.  He admits in the beginning of the book that he doesn't know how to deal with consciousness.  If you are a minimalist iconoclast, you will enjoy this book!  If you expect every implication to be addressed you will be dissapointed.  Much is left to the reader to ponder  the details.  What Barbour has to say is profound, unconventional, bold, etc.   What is frustrating is that the reader must just accept what Barbour says unless the reader can delve into the mathematics.  This is where I returned it to the library.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is Madonna's best album - by far. It's better than the Immaculate Collection and GHV2 - by streets.<br />I've not always been the biggest fan, because she has unnecessarily resorted to cheap sexual innouendo. Her talent as a composer and singer are so great that she doesn't need to do that. Having said that, Erotica is another fantastic album, but is still light years behind this one.<br />Touching, moving, melodic, rocky, sweet (in the nicest, not sugary, sense) and enigmatic. These words describe the cuts on this album. My favourites are \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\", \\"Ray of Light\\" and the final five - \\"Frozen\\", \\"Power of Goodbye\\" (the best on the album), \\"To Have and Not to Hold\\", \\"Little Star\\" and \\"Mer Girl\\". The production is marvellous - the Orbit touch.<br />It's a masterpiece, a massive surprise and I hope her next album is similar to this - and not \\"Music\\", which although pretty good, was a slight disappointment; but that's the thing about Madonna - you never know what to expect, but you will be interested.

B000002LRX|5.0|AMAZING. Words can not describe how good this album is. Every Faith No More album with Patton is incredible, but &quot;Angel Dust&quot; and &quot;King For A Day, Fool For A Lifetime&quot; are THE two best albums (both are equally incredible...). Get this CD now....it will change your life. One piece of advice: buy the Faith No More albums (with Patton) in the order that they were released. Trust me ;)
B00004XONN|5.0|But this album is still at 4 stars. This is possibly the most brilliant album I have ever heard, start to finish. It deserves more than 5 stars. All you alterna-rock fools who want another &quot;Creep&quot;, please give up. This is by far the best thing Radiohead has ever done.
B000002NG7|5.0|I did see quite a few negative reviews of this album, but the bottom line: THIS ALBUM, like all Faith No More albums, IS INCREDIBLE. All four studio albums with Patton are absolutely incredible. Out of all the FNM CDs with Patton, this is probably the one I listen to the MOST, because it's such an interesting album, and much different from the other FNM albums (however, every FNM album is different). With every listen, you appreciate this album more. In some ways, it was Faith No More's most normal-sounding rock album. <BR>&quot;Album of the Year&quot; is a fantastic album, and probably the most underrated FNM album with Patton (though all of FNM's albums are underrated).
0060537639|3.0|I received my second MA in Chinese history back in 1998, and I spent 20 years recording history books for a blind history professor. My chief paper at school was precisely the Ming voyages and why they were discontinued; my main sources were Louise Levathes's &quot;When China Ruled the Seas&quot; and Mark Elvin's &quot;The Pattern of the Chinese Past&quot;. My reaction to Menzies is that first I wouldn't accept uncritically all his assertions; I've been around long enough to know that authors sometimes fudge their data to support their pet thesis. But on the other hand, I wouldn't dismiss his book out of hand either. He's stated his thesis and now it's up to the scholarly community either to confirm it or to refute it. It's interesting that Levathes has already panned the book in a review that she wrote for the Washington Post; she based her criticism on what is already known about the Ming voyages. But I sincerely doubt that hers will be the last word.
B000002U82|5.0|Floyd's best music, at least technically, IMHO.  Not as lyrically involved as Wish You Were Here or The Wall.
B00006SFLV|5.0|this is the story of a family, the Chases, including two girls, one husband and one wife and their friends and life circle.  i find the writing amazing.  you get almost everyone's point of view, from the kids to teacher's to the parents and you see how connected we all are no matter the differencs.         the character development is so deep.  they really made these characters three dimensonal.  i find these characters more real then some people i know. the writing, the acting, & everything is brilliant and this is the perfect series.           this show has dealt, wonderfully, with issues like teen sex, drinking, homelessness as well as the life of a teen.  there has not been anything that has even comne close.  no show is even in the same builidng as this show.  way ahead of the pack.
B0000026UL|5.0|.......dylans many albums hve great lyrics but the music is sometimes not so pleasing. this album &quot;oh mercy&quot; has both great lyrics and acompannying music. for a music buff the album is manna from heaven. there are few other albums which have such qualities in all the songs, &quot;infidels&quot; is another one. but most other albums have only one or two songs having such quality. Though the lyrics of his entire song collection is very good, i for myself feel good lyrics alone is not enough....as a musically inclined person i like to listen to songs in totality. Oh mercy is perhaps one of the finest albums in this regard having both good lyrics and great music.
B00000AFGM|5.0|if you ask me THIS is MM most controversial album because alot of his die hard fans picked this up and felt he sold out but we are his family and you have to look past the glam and hype.  this is a great album, full of bowie influenced glam rock but with the MM twist that just rocks.  cannot we support an artist who is willing to change his style rather than regurgatate the same old same old as not to upset the \\"fans\\"?  i would rather have an artist change and give me something to challenging to listen to and think about.  <BR>    commenting on the hollowness of fame this album is quite the departure from the grinding blasting metal of ACS.  here we see a lighter popier side of MM  with songs like the speed of pain which is a quiet contemplative tune.  my personal favorite is disassociative but you cannot lose with songs like i dont like the drugs and the knack influenced new model.  <BR>     if you want a good pop album then this is it, if you want a GOOD artist then marilyn is a perfect start.  anyway you slice it, this is a winner
0375414053|5.0|I loved this book. As a working mother who travels weekly and who works many hours over 40 when not traveling, I identified strongly with Kate.  The issue with most critics seems to be portrayal of the more technical aspects of her job or the book's ending.  The point is that not everyone can make the same choices, work, travel, stay home, adjust your career for children, but we all have choices to make.  Perhaps for a season or perhaps for a lifetime, women are in charge of their choices and need to realize what is important.  The book would have been boring indeed if it just reflected the technical facts of Kate's job.  I still think in the end, the character remained true to her innermost struggle and came out with the best resolution for herself and her family.  Would that everyone could have such an outcome.  I highly recommend to every woman, young and old, those who work inside and outside of the home and with and without children.  I think we can all find areas to identify with and at least learn about someone else's struggles.
B000069HK2|1.0|People who listen to music for superficial reasons will adore this crap. I'm talking about people who dress a certain, and act a certain way in order to \\"claim\\" they listen to a type of music. I'm glad the best music out there today is unknown to these idiots.
0312305060|4.0|At first, I found the book extremely boring.  I almost put it down.  Luckily I didn't.  It is a wonderful piece of literature.  Mr Cunningham did a wonderful job of creating rich characters that you want to care about.  I bought three books worth mentioning This one. CHILD ABDUCTION: How to protect your children, and Self- Matters.  All worth it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|There are long games that are impossible to do in one sitting.  The memory card can save several games so you can start where you left off without starting the game over.
0312952813|5.0|The Black Ice, Michael Connelly's second crime novel in the Harry Bosch series is great.  Engrossing and well-plotted, the novel concerns the apparent suicide of one of Bosch's fellow LA police officers.  Bosch is drawn into the tangled web of the officer's life which brings him to Mexico and deep into the heart of black ice--a potent drug invading LA's streets.  The conclusion is surprising, yet still believable.  This is an excellent crime novel, very enjoyable.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|First, let me say, that I really liked the first Blade.  This movie has all of the action, all of the humor, and all of the story that made the first so great.  It is not like a Blade I remake, but there are many similarities, but that's because it is a sequel.  Blade meets up with 2 vampires which want his help.  Those two vampires take them to the &quot;Blood Pack&quot; which is an elite group of vampires that were trained to defeat Blade himself.  The vampires explain to Blade, that there is a new race called the &quot;Reapers&quot; that will turn the rest of the vampires into &quot;Reapers&quot; then do it to the humans.  Blade believes them and decides to work with them.  Together the vampires and Blade need to get along for once in this movie that is very action packed and as good as the original, so they can stop the deadly &quot;Reaper&quot; race.  On a good note too, this DVD package comes with two discs loaded with extra features!
B00005Q66T|4.0|I know it may look as if i am always complaining about the lady in question. <BR>This is a perfect collection, filled with all the hits (most of them singles) that she had between 1992 and 2000.<BR>You know them all, you know you will buy it and enjoy it.<BR>There are even a couple of tracks you could not find previously in any studio album (DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA is from the Evita soundtrack - not properly a studio album by Madonna - and i would have enjoyed immensly much more its dance remix, same applies to BEAUTIFUL STRANGER).<BR>Now...i understand she's got so many hits to fit into a single CD, but leaving out justified hits such as AMERICAN PIE (truly a hit...) or the Oscar Winner YOU MUST LOVE ME showcasing her collaboration with Britain's (and the world's) finest musical producer Andrew Lloyd Webber???<BR>And not even adding an unreleased track? <BR>I can see her point with this massive list of hits, none needs one, but it would have been nice for the fans...<BR>Dear Lady, you need to change your attitude...great album anyway!
0780624890|5.0|I love this movie.  It is about a vampire named Blade.  He is half human and half vampire.  He has all of the vampires' strengths and none of their weaknesses, except the thirst.  He hunts vampires, because he hates them and you will find out why in the movie.  There is lots and lots of action with a great plot.  At first, I didn't know that this was based on a comic, and I was surprised that it was based on a comic, because of how well it was compared to many movies based on comics.  The movie doesn't seem corny or nothing stupid.  The movie is very believable and often thoughtful.  I personally liked the movie the second time around more, because I could grip the plot and characters better.  I have seen the movie probably around 10 times and the DVD has a good amount of features.  It has commentary, alternate endings, deleted scenes, I think there about 4 featurettes, trailers, and a few more things I think.  If you don't like it the first time, I strongly recommend that you come back and watch it again later, so you can get the story better.
0517053616|5.0|Few writers in history have been able to come close to matching Shakespeare's astounding flair for writing, and this volume is the perfect compliment to his talent. The engravings inside are beautiful, and the plays, even without their numbers and their footnotes, are still as incredible as they ever were. To those of you who say that Shakespeare is boring, you're not really understanding his work, or you are simply unable to appreciate anything this old. I highly recommend this particular edition
B00006V9A0|5.0|Pain. The last words Kurt Cobain ever put to tape in a studio setting. &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; is a heart-breaking glimpse of what could've been. The verse is pushed along by a chugging bass line, into a chorus that erupts with a wave of distortion and Kurt howling that one word, &quot;Pain.&quot; Great song.<br />  Except for the eyebrow raising choice to put &quot;Been A Son&quot; on the album, and the emission of Aneurysm, everything you'd expect to be on it is there. definitely a must have for any music fan.
B000001ZS4|5.0|This is arguably my favourite album. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS AMAZING. Whats even better, is that JM Jarre has arranged the songs in order, and they are all connected to each other as if the album was one song, it finishes with the band in the rain song. JM Jarre is my favourite artist. Shame its not that long, but hey you can get 70 minutes of rubbish.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Echoing from the foggy crags, windswept moors and majestic fjords of their mysterious homeland of Iceland, Sigur Ros have created a great collection of mood altering old world orchestration.  With haunting vocals that conjure up a time when Vikings ruled, and the world was a much more mystical place.  <br />These songs will stick with you for a lifetime.  Recommended for those who like Slowdive, Enya, Ozric Tentacles and Dead Can Dance.
B000003RCY|5.0|Excellent. It disturbs me though why the band haven't got any shirts on, on the front cover. Very good heavy metal riffs, bassline, synth work, and nice vocals from Till. I love the song Der Meister.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Reading all the reviews I realized: Ignorance IS bliss.<BR>I don't care what it is... jazz,blues or country... I know that this CD certainly found a place in my collection. Yes, Her songs all sound similar... but that is not a bad thing...really!..
B0000057C5|3.0|Not as good when compared to Herzeleid. But more synths (good for me), and still some very good songs, like Alter Mann and Du Hast (you hate)
6302891272|4.0|I watched \\"Throne of Blood\\" in English class at my school, while studying about Shakespeare and \\"Macbeth\\". This movie referred to Macbeth but it was a Japanese version of it. I found it fascinating how someone could change a Shakespeare movie to another countries perspective of it. The plot  was pretty much the same but the language, enviroment, clothing,... etc. everything was changed to Japan. Macbeth was named Washizu, the soldiers held swords and arrows instead of guns, the castle had sliding doors, everyone ate on the floor with chopsticks...etc. These little things made the movie so Japanese, yet you could still tell that it was a translation of \\"Macbeth\\". <BR>I enjoyed this movie very much since I have seen the real \\"Macbeth\\" in Shakespearean language and it was just so intresting to compare it with this movie. Also since I am studying about \\"Macbeth\\" in English class. Many people might have seen different kinds of versions of \\"Macbeth\\" in English but I bet only a few has seen it the Japanese version! I recommend it to all the people who have seen the  English of the \\"Macbeth\\" first, then watch this movie you'll find it amazing!<BR>leila offner
B00005AAFS|4.0|Better than the last Album, but not as good as the first. Has some excellent songs, such as Mutter, Ich Will, and Sonne. Rammstein are great, singing in that voice in German with those heavy riffs makes it sound so damn good.
B00000JRTX|4.0|Most reviewers give a good overview of the general feel of this film.  I own this because I happen to think some of the lines/themes in the movie are pretty hilarious.  Plus, as a fan of McDowell & Scott Thomas, it was a must-own for me. For those who are not die-hard fans of Grant or the latter mentioned, rent it first to see if it's a keeper for you.  Admittedly, Grant does play the same charming cad as in most other films we've seen from him since the release of \\"Four Weddings\\"...BUT, many of the supporting actors make for uniquely witty one-liners and/or situations which are quite amusing.  So, rent it first, then buy it.  If you love the actors, though, you probably won't be disappointed.  And, of course, you can't beat the price--though I wish there were more special features on the DVD version.
B00006RIO7|1.0|If it wasn't for the new Kander and Ebb song &quot;I MOVE ON&quot; this CD would be worthless in comparison to the Broadway Original or Broadway Revival recordings of CHICAGO. <br />I don't know if it is just the way in which the sound was processed? But I don't understand why this movie didn't put together a better band to play the music.<br />What happened to the sultry, sharp, jazz edge of Chicago? I know it wasn't really in the movie, but you think they would have atleast kept it in the music. <br />Also, when you don't have the costumes, lights and editing of the movie, what is lacking in the singing and acting of this Chicago's Roxie and Billy is incredibly apparent. <br />If you like Hollywood and Pop Im sure this will add perfectly to your collection. If you like Broadway and Jazz stay Far Far Away.<br />More movie musicals. But please... Don't condescend to the musical theatre form. Just because it is a movie doesn't mean satire should be turned into parody and bite should be turned into fluff.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|...for an amazing movie.  I loved the film and am truly inspired by the soundtrack.  The melodic pieces flow well from one &quot;time period&quot; (see the movie!) to another.  This is what a great match between sound &amp; picture ought to be like.  Definitely recommend this!
B00005JL78|4.0|I really had no interest in this film.  I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, and no one else in the film really stood out.  I finally watched it when it hit DVD and I was thouroghly impressed.  Tom was good as precrime detective John Anderson.  Anderson is a member of a team of detectives who stop crimes before they happen.  The system works great.  The precogs (three teenagers in a pool of water who see things that havent happened yet. Think Dionne Warwick in high school.)  see a crime and send out a \\"message\\" that shows the crime, the victims name and the ciminals name.  The Precrime team then has to find them and arrest them before the crime is committed.  The system seems to work fine until Anderson himself is seen committing a crime.  And not just a crime, A homicide.  He must then go on the run and try to figure the who why and the where of the crime to stop himself from committing it.  It is a thrill ride that will definitely turn ever the firmest Cruise hater into a fan.  A must see flick.
B000001FDK|5.0|This music is so lively and....musical!  Recommended for those who love Grease. (the movie that is!:-D)
6303165680|3.0|Four Weddings and a Funeral is an extremely funny film.  If the opening sequence doesn't make you laugh, nothing will.  And conversely, if Matthew's moving rendition of W. H. Auden's &quot;Stop all the clocks. . .&quot; poem doesn't leave you close to tears, then you must be truly hard-hearted.  Unfortunately though, what could have been an excellent comedy has a major flaw.<br />Charles (Hugh Grant) is a likeable chap whose friends are all getting married, leaving him as a sort of perpetual Best Man.  Then American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) enters the picture and causes Charles to reassess his thoughts on marriage.  Grant has charisma in spades, but sadly MacDowell does not.  In fact, she is perhaps one of the least charismatic actresses ever.  Not only that, but the limit of her acting ability seems to be a toothpaste-advertisement-style smile.  Fortunately the casting of Charles's motley collection of single friends is excellent, and one can't help thinking he would be better off marrying one of them.<br />The film is almost fly-on-the-wall in its style, which gives it realism and allows it to explore the relationships within the group of friends on an intimate and everyday level.  Hence the subtle humour works better than, for example, Rowan Atkinson's very obvious laugh-line attempts as a preacher with a penchant for Spoonerisms.<br />As one character notes, weddings have a habit of blending together in the memory and the director has played on this, creating four weddings that are visually similar and yet distinct.  And of one of them is particularly memorable for the fact that it doesn't actually include a marriage ceremony.  At its conclusion the film shows that whilst marriage is a noble institution, it is not for everybody.
B00005T343|5.0|This movie was GREAT!!  It had terrific suspense and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Anthony Hopkins plays a AWESOME Hannibal Lector.  I recomend this movie to anyone who likes murder and suspense.
B00006LSM3|4.0|This album is a must own for any Beatle/Harrison fan ranking a close second to George's greatest post Beatles release, All Things Must Pass.  It's all here:  creative songwriting, lyrics that connect, vibrant and rich with George's vocals and I challenge you to name any other George release, Beatles or solo, that so richly, frequently and effectively presents George's trademark slide guitar sound. Goodbye George...thanks for the parting gift!
0380789035|5.0|Only the Gods are real.  And in Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods&quot;, they have been brought over from distant lands only to be cast aside and foresaken for the new symbols of progress; the modern worship of the profane.<br />Shadow is the nickname of our protagonist, whose journey through America is quite unlike any other committed to literature.  It is a circus of road-side attractions (portrayed comically here as ancient &quot;places of power&quot;) among fantastic but strangely believable characters who all originate from the old myths and beliefs of those who had come to America.  Everyone from Loki to Johnny Appleseed gets at least a brief nod.<br />Shadow's metaphorical journey is a deeply personal tale, like seeing a man walk through his own dreams and make decisions based only on the reality of the dream.  Every situation and bit of dialogue, despite it's frequent absurdity, feels deeply real and uncontrived.  Indeed, &quot;American Gods&quot; succeeds as being a true fantasy novel in it's artistic aspirations and it's uninhibited sense of reality, without giving in to the silliness and formulaic versions of many post-Tolkien fantasy writers.  It speaks to the imagination, while also speaking to the question mark that is America.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot; is like walking through your hometown with a tour guide, who can point out the things you didn't know and rebuke the things you thought you knew.  It is a gem of modern literature.
B00000099Y|5.0|I'll make this review short, otherwise no one will read it all the way through. I know I wouldn't.This cd will change you. This particular tool cd is one of the best.  On the first listen, this and all tool Cds may bore you. No matter how much you hate it, the more you listen to it the more you'll love it. I have yet to get sick of any song on this CD. This CD will disappoint almost no one that likes any type of music. If you buy CDs from only one band make it tool. Tool is also the best band i've ever seen in concert, they have some pretty spectacular visuals.Quite being skeptical and just buy the damn CD. Favorite Tool song: Third Eye
B000005S0V|5.0|&quot;The Very Best Of Elton John&quot; is a excellent and essential compillation of Elton's greatest hits. Every song here is classic, all 30 of them. Disc 1 contains all of the extremely popular tunes, while disc 2 contains some very intriguing selections.<br />Disc 1 opens with the timeless evergreen chords of 1970s' &quot;Your Song&quot;, and continues throught the stark and ethereal &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, the jumpy &quot;Honky Cat&quot;, the hardrockin' &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot;, and the brilliant &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;.<br />Disc 2 also features classics such as the lusty &quot;I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues&quot;, the thumping &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot;, the mysteriously longing &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, the funky &quot;Easier To Walk Away&quot; and the brilliant &quot;You Gotta Love Someone&quot;. &quot;Part-Time Love&quot; and &quot;Passengers&quot; are odd inclusions, but nonetheless, really good.<br />&quot;The Very Best Of Elton John&quot; is the very best of Elton John. Essential music to one of the greatest entertainers of the twenthieth century.
B00006AULI|5.0|I love this movie. I'm a Massachusetts native and live just a few miles from Danvers State Hospital (and just down the street from Gordon's house in the movie), and know (and I have tried) that it is almost impossible to get up on to hospital grounds, so when i found out about this movie i was exstatic. I immediately fell in love with this movie, and so did all my friends who know call me Mary...I would suggest this movie to anyone who likes a good psych thriller or just wants to see something different.
B00004R99T|5.0|Why does Disney love to come out with sequels. Last year we had The Return to Neverland. And  to mention these sequels to. The Return of Jafar, Aladdin and the King of Theives, Cindrella 2: Dreams come True, 101 2: Patch's London Adventure (out today). What is next? Lilo & Stitch 2, The Ememror's Neve Groove 2? As the movie opens, the King of London believes Radcliff's lies, so he orders that John Smith (Mel Gibson) to arrested. But when John Smith learns that he is being arrested, he falls into water. While in America, Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) had learned of his death, and is confused on where she should go from there. But when when John Rolfe (Billy Zane) shows up on orders from the king to bring back the chief, an indian decides that Pocahontas should go to London instead of Chief Powhatan (Rusell Means). Powhatan has another indian who never talks to make the journey to london.
0393316041|5.0|Richard Feynman is the greatest hero in my heart!, not only beacuase his great scientific achievement and his great ability of teaching, but also a really interesting man! This book show us how interesting he is! I read it four times, and laugh aloud every time! There are so many interesting anecdotes in the book that I can't help thinking Feynman is a lovely imp.<BR>  This book haven't terrible mathematical equation and formula. But It tells us how Richard Feynman think, how he do physics? it also tells us the really Feynman, maybe the greatest physicist in his generation. I especially appreciate the way of Feynman do physics, that is, he do physics just like play games, not for Nobel prizer, not for reputation, but just for enjoyment!

B0000646UN|5.0|Finn power to the extreme. Nobody can defeat the Finns not even the Russian Juggernaut. One of the greatest Finnish movies of all time! This is a must buy! Do yourself a favor and buy this film! I love the Finnish spoken in the film! SISU! What the other reveiwers fail to mention is that this is a true story! The Russians started the war and the Finns ended it.<BR> <BR> Jason Hepokoski
B000060OFT|5.0|You will either hate this film or love it. I LOVE IT! I watch it at least four times per week. My first time viewing it was in '96 and I fell asleep. My next time was in '02 and I have been hooked every since!!! I have seen every other version of R&J from Shearer and Howard to Whiting and Hussey and neither version has the passion of this R&J. I do not believe that anyone else will film another version as it will surely pale in comparison of this one. If there is a weak spot, it is the opening gas station scene. To survive that means that you will love the rest. Hold on to your seat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005ARDC|5.0|My favorite bands are usually ones that can wield both power and beauty. BRMC has it. Though many of BRMC's songs hark back to the shoegazer bands, they definitely have their own style, and Spread Your Love even stomps into blues-rock territory. This album doesn't have to wait to become a classic. It is one. As with Trail of Dead's Source Tags and Codes and My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, you'll want to turn this one up as loud as you possibly can to get the full body of sound and become lost in it. Speaking of MBV, engineer Alan Moulder is thanked in the liner notes, and I can't shake the feeling that sometime in the near future BRMC may produce a Loveless of their own.
0316666343|1.0|I read a few pages of The Lovely Bones online at www.amazon.com and thought I just had to read the rest, so I bought the hardcover. I wish I'd saved my money. To sum it up, the book was monotonous. I was amazed how Sebold could find so many words to say the same thing over and over. The characters were so dry, I actually got thirsty. The ending fizzled. I feel sorry for the dead if they are as tormented as Susie (the main character). This book left me feeling broke and frustrated.
0151008116|4.0|This book is interesting, unpredictable and unique.  As I read it I felt alternately surprised, amused, delighted, touched, and at times transported to another world.  It is an enjoyable adventure and a spiritual book as well.  I highly recommend it.
B0000797IO|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have seen in some time.  Aniston does not succeed in portraying anyone but herself - she talks the same, shuffles her feet, hangs her head all in an attempt to give the image of boredom and dissatisfaction which is exactly what the viewer will get with this performance and movie.  I suggest watching paint dry for better entertainment.
B00000255F|4.0|4 great and 4 mediocre songs. 4 stars for this album. One of the most praised and landmark albums of all time does not click 100% for me. I liked the latest 'The Rising' and the album following this 'Darkness at the edge of time' more than this album. The reason is stated in the first line of the review. The 4 great songs to me are 'Thunder road', 'Born to run', 'Night' and 'Jungleland'. The rest 4 just fail to match the brilliance of these songs. While rating album I think it is right to judge the consistency of the album. That's where it loses a star.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a very good album. 'Night' has a great tune. I would like to compare it with 'Further up on the road' from 'The Rising'. Simply superb. 'Born to run' and 'Thunder Road' rocks. 'Jungleland' finishes with Bruce sounding like Mark Knopfler. Instruments by the E-street band is excellent, specially Roy Bittan's piono set the mood of the album (Remember how he made a guest appearence to make Dire Straits's 'Making Movies' sounding like a Bruce Springsteen album). As a listener of rock music you should have this album but I thinks it is not his best album, but with this a new bruce is born... to rule.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Hi,<BR>  I am a great fan of enrique because he is a great solo singer,smart,sexy and his musics are really good.I think his song,HERO was the best to me @ it is a really good love song.Lastly, he is my one @ the only favorite singer i have discovered.                                   <BR>                                      Thanks From,   <BR>                                          RINCHEN.
B000002GOZ|4.0|Although some of the tracks are from his more recent work, I still decided to buy this album because I was interested to hear the unplugged versions of &quot;Summer of 69&quot;, &quot;Cuts Like A Knife&quot;, &quot;I'm Ready&quot;, &quot;Fits Ya Good&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot;. I wasn't disappointed. Each track is different enough from the originals, and sounded good enough to make buying the album worthwhile. If you're a fan of unplugged music, or you're a Bryan Adams fan who's interested to hear what his songs sound like, I would definately recommend buying MTV Unplugged.
B00003CXXP|2.0|After finishing AI, I felt both moved by the story and sick of Spielberg shoving emotions down my throat.  I found the ending brilliant, despite taking way too long to get there. It would have been moving enough without being drenched with gushing sentimentality.  Still, give Stephen credit for doing something different, and give credit to the cast for delivering terrific performances.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is Slipknot's major debut album, it is the awesome predecessor of their VERY limited and hard to find official debut \\"Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat\\" released in 1996. Slipknot shows their true sicness and intensity in songs like \\"Eyeless\\" and \\"Liberate\\". They have raw talent as shown by guitarists Mick(#7) and Jim(#4) in \\"SIC\\" and \\"Surfacing\\", those feature the best guitar riffs i've ever heard in my life. My favorite songs on this cd are \\"Liberate\\" \\"SIC\\" and \\"Spit it Out\\". This cd is worth every penny..The best cd in my collection by far!!!
0316666343|1.0|Please don't read this book.  It trivializes horror.  Keep it as far away from young children and teenagers as possible.  Teach them the evils that exist in this world and instill in them the precautions they must take to stay safe, but DO NOT let this book be their teacher.  Murder, adultery, theft, betrayal, rape, teenage sex.  Are these truly our bestselling themes?
B000071ZZI|5.0|If you read the book and liked it, get this movie!!  The book and the movie are different, but, I can count on one hand the number of movies that followed the book.  With that said, this movie is one of the better spy movies.  There are 2 people that have no idea what will happen next: Jason Bourne and YOU.  The storyline is good, and the action is wonderful.  <br />A good job was done on the transfer and the sound, in DTS, really makes this movie come alive.  All the extras are there: Director's comments, The Making of, and subtitles, etc..<br />It will be money well spent, as you will watch this movie many, many times.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a strong book that provides a compelling and well written exploration of death.  Her characters are well contructed and provide a believable foundatation for their reactions and interactions.  <br />This story is about a family dealing with a horrible crime.  The crime is told in grisley detail.  People who have problems with graphic violence will have problems with this book.  Not everyone will want to read or finish this book.  Those who do will find a way to explore how a heartrending tragedy can break a family and how the family members can find ways to heal again.

0201485672|4.0|Before I read this book, when someone mentioned refactoring, I would imagine it would be either &quot;code cleanup&quot;, e.g., refactoring out the common behavior to the base class or a subroutine or &quot;total redesign&quot;, e.g., breaking up current architecture, all these two can be avoided and unnecessary if we analyze the problem right, abstract the model right, architect the application right, design and code right.<br />I am a bigot of OO technology, design patterns, iterative software develop process from analysis, architure, design, construction to testing, and I know to get all the above things &quot;right&quot; would be very hard if not impossible at all. But that is what our designers and developers' job, facing the challenge right? So how is refactoring going  to affect us as designers and develoers?<br />The first chaper(example) is particular interesting and attractive to me, as it just pointed out some signs of &quot;evilness&quot; in the design, e.g., a lot of tag/case for runtime type checking, responsibility was assigned to the wrong class, inaccurate/insufficient abstraction. Actually, it is this chapter which made me decide to get the book and see how the author would correct these problems. Mr. Fowler did excellent job on this topic.<br />Most Software developers may not have the luxuery to always work on the new project from start, we may inherit legacy codes which was not designed to solve today's problem, even an initial good design could go decayed, be it lack of documentation, insufficient of communication, different levels within the develop team, etc. Now with this book, we can take a breath and start refactoring the existing design/code to make it solve today's requirement, to even make it extensible for tommorrow's change. Initial design is no longer a huge burden, as it can be refactored, extended to fit the unseenable things when it was made.<br />The only thing in this book that annoys me is the verbosity of the refactoring stepsin each chapter. It exposed to much details. I think the text decription and UML notation would be enough for any experienced developers to see  the design problems and how to correct them. All those steps would only serve the needs for refactoring tools developers. But even with all the details, it is a &quot;light&quot; reading :-)

What it DOES have is spectacular acting, a great story, and an astoundingly good script -- all the more incredible considering this is one film of hundreds that Hollywood churned out in the wartime and post-war 1940's. If you don't like black-and-white movies -- then just close your eyes and listen to it. It's worth the money.
B000068TPN|5.0|A must have for movie fans, this movie portraits with crude realism the horrors of war, the heroic spirit within us and the internal fears that any soldier can experience.<br /> I liked a lot the director's management about the two commanders one leading the action iat the battelfield (Hal Moore), and the other form downunder, facing strategic and tactic problems and the human touch, everything together made a great war movie, in a class by itself.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|An excellent action movie, Wesley Snipes looks better than the first film, the european locations and scenography really inmerse you in a very gothic environment, the soundtrack it's great (the DTS track sounds amazing), this is a movie that  serious home theater fans will enjoy eternally, picture is astounding with sharp, clear images with no artifacts, the second disc it's fully loaded with interesting stuff, highly recomended, beautifully presented, bloody, well done.
B000001DYJ|4.0|While this CD is a testament to the fact that Kiss are a band who are at their best live, one can't help wondering if this album only exists because $DOLLAR$ signs lit up in Gene's eyes. Maybe, maybe not. But once again, KISS have delivered the goods. Among the highlights in this set are (finally live) I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT and ANOTHER reappearance of DETROIT ROCK CITY and ROCK N ROLL ALL NITE. An unexpected highlight is FOREVER  co-written by (shock horror) MICHAEL BOLTON!! Flippin' heck!! AND IT'S A GOOD SONG! <BR>Kiss have delivered three great live albums in succesion throughout their career, so I'm expecting ALIVE 4 to measure up to these standards when I get a copy.
031286504X|5.0|I Am Legend is considered by many to be one of the most influential vampire stories of all time. It's a reputation well deserved, written in the 50s it was one of the first stories to remove vampires from gothic castles and place them in familiar urban settings. Although the vampires are rightly so, a important part of the story, a more important part is the main character &quot;Robert Neville&quot;. I Am Legend is the story of a regular man, not a hero, just a regular man forced into a life of solitary wandering in a world that constantly reminds him of how wonderful the world truly is and how that world will never exist again. It is a story of how humanity copes with life in a dead world with no meaning. To some it may seem that neville wastes his time as the last man on earth, but what would any of us really be able to do? Looking for a cure is vaccine is hopeless, there is no-one left to use a vaccine on. Ridding the world of these vampires? Why? There's no one left to take the world back over once they're all gone. I am legend is a story of how humanity copes, and goes on in a world with nothing left.
B000069HK2|5.0|i bought this album last year after having a friend tell me that they were really good and let me tell you...it was possibl the best album i could have bought last year.  it doesn't really remind me of any similiar bands (that i listen to at least).  it has its on flavor.  bert (the singer) can be screaming one minute then singing the next and it sounds really good.  my favorite songs on the cd are &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot;, &quot;Bulimic&quot;, &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot;, and &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects.&quot;  these guys are totally one of the bands i expect to be a bit bigger this year and apparently so did MTV or TRL for including them in their New Band Week on TRL.  These guys rock and so does the album so i suggest you buy it!
630170648X|5.0|There were plenty of his contemporaries, George Burns and Johnny Carson among them, who thought Jack Benny was the best American comedian of the 20th century.  This film does nothing to detract from his reputaion; it just confirms it.  Benny is utterly superb here in a wonderful and difficult project by the German-Jewish director Ernst Lubitsch.  He effortlessly dominates a great cast in every scene and his timing, for which he was already famous on stage and in radio, is equally flawless.  The film about the invasion of Poland was produced before the full extent of the anti-Semitic atrocities committed in Europe were known, and the great Lubitsch took a somewhat more diplomatic approach than more heavy-handed directors like Mel Brooks would today, but this artistic detachment certainly made a better movie.  There are some flat-out riotous lines.  When a Gestapo agent leeringly tells Carole Lombard he would like to launch a romantic blitzkrieg her way, she responds:  \\"I'd prefer a slow encirclement.\\"  Movie comedy doesn't get much more sophisticated.
0345363132|5.0|Wow, historical fiction is rarely such a treat. I was up til 5 a.m. reading, and it was worth it! A thoroughly satisfying blend of strong, believable characters and historical accuracy.  Obviously, much in Richard Plantagenet's life (and in this time period in general) is open to speculation and interpretation. Penman takes a stand on her characters and supports it with historical material and inspired imagination.  Penman's vision has the virtue of being plausible, achingly real and exquistely human.  As a dyed-in-the-wool Richardian, I applaude this book's compassionate view of Richard III. Bravo!
B000003N89|5.0|After buying and enjoying her next two albums (Love scenes and When I look in your eyes), this one came as a surprise to me - but what a pleasant surprise. Like Jeri Southern, a brilliant singer-pianist of an earlier generation, Diana began as a pianist but was obliged to sing as well in order to get work. On this album, recorded when Diana was still unknown, Diana's piano is very prominent.  For those who enjoy hearing Diana singing love songs, there are plenty here, but there are upbeat songs to give more variation than you will find in the other albums I mentioned.<br />Yet, this is all achieved with very few musicians. Russell Malone on guitar and Paul Keller on bass accompany Diana singing and playing piano. On most tracks, that's it. Steve Kroon plays percussion on Boulevard of broken dreams, while Benny Green plays piano on If I had you, leaving Diana (for that track only) to just sing.<br />You have to be good to deliver an album of such quality with so few musicians (especially without a drummer), but Diana and her musicians prove that it can be done. While I did not find this album as instantly appealing as her next two (perhaps because it was not what I expected), it is one that grows on me each time I play it.
B00006SFBD|5.0|As a fan of this great  melodic deathmetal band  \\"Opeth\\" i have to say that \\"Deliverance\\" is an very impressive album with a great production and intense sound. I own albums like \\"orchid\\" , \\"still life\\", \\"PARKBLACKWATER\\" , and i think that \\"Deliverance\\" is  by far the worse of them all, im not sayng its a bad record im  simply comparing it to the others ... just clearing things out because  \\"Deliverance\\" is  a masterpiece.Well, get up and buy it now !
079284632X|3.0|Wes Craven's film debut, The Last House on the Left, is a disturbing movie to say the least and was a movie that crossed the line. The movie can be considered scary because the type of crime committed in the film is a realistic possibility anywhere. The Last House on the Left is disturbing and shocking. Four convicts escape from prison and hide out in an apartment building. When 2 young girls Mari Collingwood(Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis Stone(Lucy Grantham) go searching for marijuana in the wrong place they run into the convicts and are tortured, raped and left for dead. It preceeded \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\"(1978) which seems to have stolen many of the same ideas from Last House but added much more nudity and excessive brutality. <br /> My problem with this movie however is the acting with one exception. If you do view this film you will see what I mean. Marshall Anker and Martin Kove(The sheriff and the deputy) give the most [horrible] performances I've ever seen unless these cops are supposed to be ... clowns. Gaylord St. James plays Dr. William Collingwood, besdies seeming disconcerned about his daughter's disappearence it takes him about 5 minutes to kill the lead convict Krug Stillo(David Hess) with a chainsaw. The only notable performance in my opinion was that of David Hess who was excellent as a maniacal, conscienceless, cruel psychopath.<br /> The Last House on the Left is without a doubt a ground breaking film and one you won't soon forget. It will get a reaction from you whether it be positive or negative which I believe was Wes Cravens goal in this film. Give it a look and form your own opinion.

B00000JGHM|5.0|This film is nothing less than a masterpiece. A perfect blend of drama, crime thriller and action. Michael Mann's direction is brilliant and all the actors give good performances - especially Pacino and Deniro who finally share the screen in a truly classic scene. The plot contains many layers and it avoids most of the clich&eacute;s that usually characterise films within this genre. Furthermore, the characters are not reduced to stereotypes which is also quite rare in a Hollywood film these days. Heat is one of the few truly great films that came out of Hollywood in the 1990s, but of course it did not win a single Academy Award.

B000002TYK|5.0|I bought 2 Foo Fighters Albums (One by One and The Colour and Shape) within the last 2 months and they're really awesome (5 stars and beyond), 2 of my top ten favorite Cds, and the Foos became my favorite band. When I bought this album, I was a little surprised because it's great but it's not as awesome as all their other CDs. There's a lot of great songs but not all of them are great, all the songs on One by One are great. If your a major Foo Fan than buy this, but if you don't have another Foo Fighters album, buy another instead.
B00003CXA3|5.0|The French Connection is among the best films of all time.  It easily earned those five major Academy Awards.  I personally rate this particular work of Director William Friedkin in the top fifty.  Unfortunately, it also has much in common with the infamous racist Birth of a Nation.  I hesitate to compare the French Connection to Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi Triumph of the Will, but others might legitimately make this case.  In other words, a moral person, after viewing this movie, should come away with a conclusion possibly not intended by its creators.  The French Connection, loosely based on a real series of events, was filmed in 1971 when many people naively thought that a victory on the war on drugs was right around the corner.  Many excused the disgraceful behavior of \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner \\"Cloudy\\" (Roy Schieder) as simply necessary in combatting the international drug cartels.  The ground breaking car chase was wildly cheered and few considered whether it made sense for Doyle to risk the lives of innocent citizens in pursuit of the fleeing criminal.  In another disturbing scene, the two detectives violate the rights of bar patrons who may not have necessarily been involved in illegal activity.  The fact that these folks were Afro-American may be a commentary on the racial attitudes of that period.  One does not need to be a political leftist to be appalled by such disgraceful police behavior.  The editors of the conservative National Review  also decry our nation's ludicrous war on mind altering drug use.<br />There is something that was deliberately left out of the film: the French Connection case accomplished essentially nothing!  The seized heroin were soon found missing in the police evidence room.  Almost certainly,  these drugs were eventually sold on the streets of New York.  It is now thirty one years later,  and we have yet to realize the foolishness of prohibiting people from choosing to indulge in self destructive activity.  Our current laws have only made matters worse.  I strongly recommend that you see a few other films devoted to the same theme.  Rush, Blow, Traffic, and the most recent Narc, also deserve your time and interest.current laws have only made matters worse.

0312243022|2.0|Yes Michael Cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities.  The lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny.  It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood.  It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning.  Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader.  It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare.
B00003CXXM|3.0|The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon is okay but it pales in comparison to the original miniseries with Richard Chamberlin. It is almost as if the two movies aren't telling the same story.   The story is not as well developed and isn't as true Ludlum's novel.  There isn't enough character development and the movie short cuts the travel, and intrigue generated by the miniseries.
B000002IOW|3.0|1989's &quot;Presto&quot; shows Rush continuing to evolve, pushing in different directions and moving forward as a group rather than rest on tried and tired formulas.  As with a lot of work by Rush, one needs to take repeated listenings and read the lyrics to get acquainted with the work.  Listen to this one on headphones and you'll be hooked.<br />The music strikes a great blending of the three musicians' instruments, full of throbbing bass, snappy drums and layers of guitars.  Things that stood out for me on this recording were the great dynamics between loud/quiet and hard/soft.  &quot;Chain Lightning is a good example of this.  I agree that the keyboard sound so pervasive through their 1980s releases really works here, both in sound and atmospherics.  The same can be said of the guitars, as Alex Lifeson achieves a variety of sound from track to track often missing in previous disks.  I like that he used a lot of acoustic guitar on this release.  &quot;Scars&quot; is a good example of this sonic quality.<br />There is also some genuine piano type playing, like on &quot;Red Tide.&quot;  Rush revives a bit of their fusion/math-rock on &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; with tricky rhythms and start/stop attack.<br />Each track sounds different and has its own voice, and I liked the overlapping vocals by Geddy Lee on &quot;Chain Lightning.&quot;<br />The lyrics also have social relevance.  &quot;The Pass&quot; takes on teen suicide.  &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; is a dare to dream and spread hope.  Neil Peart continues to urge the listeners to push themselves, chase their dreams and live life both for the present and future.<br />I liked the direction of this disk and where it was heading in terms of the Rush sound.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Memento is an outstanding effort--both the film-making and acting are superb.  I think many however, would admit [perhaps only to themselves] that this film goes up a few notches based primarily on the fact that it was such a sleeper and went mostly unrecognized by the movie-going public.<br />If Memento had been promoted the way say...Minority Report had been, i.e., with showy appearances on Oprah and the evening talk-shows, I'm not sure it would be so critically acclaimed by every armchair movie buff [including yours truly of course].  Part of what made Memento so good was the surprise I had because I didn't have enormous expectations.  After seeing the film in the theater, I rented it and didn't feel nearly as enthusiastic the second time through; although I still think it's a very well written, directed, and acted film.<br />I suppose it's just the nature of having a trick ending...the red herring isn't so persuasive when you know you're being had.  In short, I'm not sure this is the sort of film I'd really want to *own*.  Maybe if I had a friend over who'd never seen it, but even that's no fun really.  It's always better to get something neither of you have seen.  So, I'd say Memento is certainly worth seeing at least once and then a second time to accentuate the fact that you were completely duped the first time around, but apart from that, I'd pass on this as a purchase.  <br />I think I could write a nearly identical review for the Usual Suspects too.  For some reason however, I feel much differently about the Sting for some reason.  Hmm...perhaps there's more to my lack of enthusiasm for Memento than just the trick ending.  Food for thought.<br />4/5
0316666343|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, I had bought this book when it first came out and put it aside along with my other books that are waiting to be read. When I first started this book I knew that it was going to be sad, as I was reading along the story started shifting gears to another direction and that's were I got lost. I promised myself that this year I would finish a book that I start no matter how bad it is now I can say that I did read it and I was so disappointed in the end.<br />Happy Reading Lisa

B00006LSM3|5.0|George worked on this album up until two months before he died.  Unable to put the finishing touches on himself, he left reams of notes for his son, Dhani, and Jeff Lynne to let them know exactly how he wanted it finished.  The final product is a worthy farewell from one of rocks most beloved artists.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves George, The Beatles, or just plain good music.  Those who found it less than praiseworthy in their reviews leave me baffled, but it's their loss, as there will never be another album this good from a former Beatle again.  To those who long for a new &quot;Beatle's song&quot; I particularly want to point out &quot;Rising Sun&quot;. I tried an experiment -- I played this song for several people who had no idea who it was, or when it was recorded. Unanimously, they said it sounded like The Beatles.  Barring any miraculous &quot;finds&quot; in George Martin's basement, &quot;Rising Sun&quot; is likely the last song by an ex-Beatle that recalls the band's roots. Buy it, enjoy it, and remember, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, but sometimes we're left with an amazing legacy -- this is one of those times.
