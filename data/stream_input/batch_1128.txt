B000TU16GS|1.0|At first I thought this was just a bad book, then I realized it was written to be that way.  It's shallow and contains only the barest hint of character development with a few improbably gadgets thrown in.  Perfect for a bad movie targeted at pre-teen boys.  Female characters are clearly just preparing the young lads who read this for their future understanding that woman are either castrating sadists or compliant mother figures.  And as far as a better understanding of the world outside a whiter-than-white London?  Well those foreigners are swarthy, evil and do gross things like eat dogs.  What trash.
0345528581|4.0|I enjoyed Mark Lauren's book because it does provide a great variety of mostly body weight-only exercises that do work.  Some of the moves are innovative, or, at least, good adaptations of traditional squats, push-ups, etc.  They are not running military boot camps by lining up rows of bench presses, doing a few reps, then 'resting' a few minutes--so rest assured, body weight exercises are effective.  The descriptions and pictures of the exercises are excellent.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars for a few reasons.  First, having worked out for years, I disagree that you can have a truly effective program without a chin-up bar.  World-class trainer or not, Mr. Lauren's suggestions to use doorknobs, broomsticks, chairs, paint cans, etc. come close, but only if your budget will simply not allow for the most basic of fitness equipment.  Also, in my opinion, some of the improvised moves are not entirely safe--I wonder how much abuse most hollow doors or modern (plastic) broomsticks can take.  Honestly, some very basic equipment is necessary--in my opinion, the minimum is a chin-up bar.  You could survive without dumbbells by doing traditional (and effective) moves like push-ups, squats, and dive-bombers and skip moves like lateral shoulder raises and dumbbell chest presses.<br /><br />Second, like the other reviewers, the book contains numerous typographical/editorial errors, and the overall \\"flow\\" could be better.  Obviously not a big deal, but it detracts from the professionalism of the book.<br /><br />Finally, the fitness routine charts seem to have been hastily thrown together and placed among a few pages at the back of the book.  I found the layout of these charts to be somewhat confusing relative to many of the other fitness books I've read.<br /><br />EDIT 2014: I was browsing, as usual, through the Amazon bookstore and saw my review.  I actually changed my 3 star to a 4 star because, relative to the many books I purchased since I first read Mark's book, this is a very good reference overall.  Mark put a lot of effort into explaining each exercise and, my slight complaint about equipment is minor.  As I get older, I notice that body-weight training helps me feel strong and flexible after a workout--and energized.  Body-weight training can be varied, say, using supersets to keep the heart rate up to Pavel Tsatsouline's \\"ladders\\" to develop pure strength.  (I like Pavel, but, the books are a little expensive.  Google 'Pavel Ladders,' a concept he explained in the Journal \\"Milo\\" more than 10 years ago.)  In contrast, heavy barbell work has been leaving me feeling sore and exhausted, with nagging problems like aching shoulders and tender knees.  I'm sure a doctor could explain this, and my experience is obviously unique to me, but body-weight training doesn't beat me up like the barbell does--yet, it seems to still provide a very good fitness benefit.<br /><br />I'll admit, I often feel like I need to \\"add weight\\" to an exercise in order to make it \\"effective.\\"  If you agree, try Mark's workouts with a weight-vest...it gets hard fast, and it is only one additional piece of equipment.  I don't think I can link to the site, or I would make a recommendation.  Don't get one filled with little bags of sand.<br /><br />People all over the internet will debate which is best: body-weight training, barbell training, dumbbells, kettlebells, etc. etc.; the reality is, the best training is the one the one you can do right now.  Although many will argue, try the workouts, see how you feel.  I think this book gives you something you can do right now for a fair price, so I've upgraded to 4 stars from 3.

B004RL9T50|2.0|Just did not seem to capture my children or me.  Some of the music was a lousy pick.  It could have really been good, but they must have let warped minds in to put it together.  Very easy to forget about it once you have made it through it.  Maybe they should have watched Tangled to find out what a good movie for the family is.
1934356476|5.0|Anybody who has wondered about the magical code in Ruby source code and has had only a patchwork understanding of Ruby metaprogramming from various sources will find it all explained here.    The major complaint about the book from these reviews is the narrative style of the exposition.  I read the complaints before picking up the book so I was prepared--and found them unwarranted.    The purpose of the story and characters is to provoke thinking and understanding.  The method succeeds.

B001KVZ6FW|1.0|\\"UP!\\" IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE . . . THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE \\"UP!\\" BUT OF THE DVD PRODUCT SOLD AT AMAZON . . .  Too bad this rating scale does not include zero or negative rating numbers.  Loved the movie in the theater and wanted to add it to our library.  Bought the DVD from Amazon and it arrived promptly...as did the replacement sent by Amazon when I returned the first DVD.  However, both DVDs fail to play on our DVD machine.  Previews play up to menu.  Select \\"PLAY\\" from the manu and the usual Disney beginning, then a blank screen with message, \\"UNABLE TO PLAY DUE TO DISC ERROR\\".  Tried several times and now the DVD machine just locks up when I insert this DVD.  Plays on computer, but that room is too small for family viewing comfort.  DVD machine plays all the previews, though I feel it is unlikely we will ever purchase another Disney DVD.  I have read other comments here and elsewhere on [...]  It appears this may be a illconceived/misbegotten attempt at copy protection by Disney.

B00005S6K8|5.0|Rarely are remakes better than the originals versions, but in this version of Sabrina they accomplish just that. I like this version of Sabrina better than the original version, because of the wonderful acting and dialogue. This movie reminds me of a fairy tale with a unexpected happy ending. This movie will make you laugh and make you smile during the whole movie. It is one of the few movies Harrison Ford has every played that wasn't an action or drama film. In this movie it shows that Harrison Ford is not only good at acting in drama movies but that he actually has a romantic bone in his body.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat-ware' on my Moto Defy so I've been ignoring it for months. Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing, this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem.
B001B92E5I|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas.  Works great as a vinyl since it is terrific all the way through (rare these days).  The songs are at times shamelessly following the songwriting and rock formula set forth by Bruce Springsteen, but there is nothing wrong with that.  The Gaslight Anthem injects their own flavor into that formula, and combined with Brian Fallon's unique voice, the songs feel fresh and are a great listen.  Also, if you are a fan of this album, check out the band live.  I have seen them three times and each has been better than the last.  They leave it all on the stage and truly enjoy performing - that's all you can ask for as a fan.

0756404738|4.0|Simply put - this book is plain fun to read.      Similar to \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" I found myself waiting for a single defining event/turn of events, but it didn't come in this book either.  However, it is the journey that the main character (Kvothe) takes the reader on that is what makes this book worth reading.  \\"A Wise Man's Fear\\" provides the reader a more in-depth understanding of Kvothe and develops the relationship with him.  I would expect that all fans of this series will have an even tougher time waiting for Book 3 than they did waiting for \\"A Wise Man's Fear.\\"
0756404738|3.0|The first half of Wise Man's Fear is an improvement over the previous book in the Kingkiller Chronicles.  There is intrigue, mystery, complex interpersonal drama, great writing, and great pacing.  Then halfway through the book, Rothfuss decides to let us in on the fantasies of his fifteen-year-old self, and the book goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The book picks up precisely when the previous book left off, sparing little time to catch people up or re-explain everything in case a reader started with book two.  I'm glad about that.  I hate it when a series is up and running and the author or publisher feels that they need to throw in some exposition for people who didn't read the earlier books.  Seriously...who starts a series at book two?  Anyway...It goes great for a long while.  I found the second half of the first book to be the best, and this seemed like a continuation of that.  A lot happens, mostly having to do with Kvothe's adventures at the University and then on to a different land, where Kvothe gets some experience dealing with nobility and goes on an adventure with a ragtag group of adventurers.<br /><br />Then...just over halfway through the book, the plot comes to a grinding halt. Don't want to spoil anything.  So I'll just say that something happens that is totally unrelated to what had been going on in the first two books.  It is mentioned in book one (I think), but only as one of Kvothe's many legendary accomplishments.  Funny thing is, what happens is very similar to one of the fantasies I used to dream up before bed when I was a nerdy, lonely, sex-crazed teenager.  I don't mind the occasional bit of self-indulgence from an author, but this goes on way too long, further emphasizing just how juvenile it is.  After it is finally over, we are then diverted again to another side-adventure in which Kvothe learns how to fight.  Once again, the teenage fantasies kick-in, and not only does he learn to fight, but he gets to have sex with hot women while doing doing it. As I was reading this, I couldn't help but chuckle and shake my head at just how unbelievable and juvenile the whole thing is.  And yet again it goes on way too long.  After these two bits are over, we get a bit of the good from the first half again...then the books is over.<br /><br />I felt the author took too long with side-diversions and things left unresolved from book one were left hanging, especially his relationship with Denna.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but I feel confident in advising anyone who hasn't read this yet to go ahead and skip the \\"romantic\\" scenes with Denna.  Seriously.  Just skip them.  NOTHING is resolved.  They are frustrating, and not in a Pride and Prejudice way, but in a \\"Yeah, yeah, dude...We get the picture...She's hard to get!  Can we PLEASE move ON!!!\\" way.  Also, Denna is the most uninteresting character in the series.  Her only good qualities seem to be that she is pretty and witty.  Given the many interesting women with whom Kvothe finds himself, Denna is the least exciting.<br /><br />My favorite of Kvothe's relationships is the one with loan-shark Devi, a fascinating character who practically leaps off of the page.  When you read her scenes, it almost feels like Rothfuss realizes how much more interesting she is than Denna, and so stubbornly stops himself from letting her truly shine in the way she should.<br /><br />C'mon Patrick!  Free Devi!  ...Or else make Denna more interesting.  We should be given a reason to fall in love her along with our protagonist.  SO far, you have given us no reason for Kvothe's bizarre obsession with her, and given us every reason to fall in love with Devi.  Can't blame us for that.<br /><br />The book is worth reading if you can tell yourself to go ahead and skip ahead a few pages when it feels like it is meandering.  I will read the third installment when it comes out.  Hopefully Rothfuss will keep it moving forward and spare us the adolescent fantasies the next time around..

0618526412|2.0|Characters    The book follows 5 different characters, John Singer (a deaf-mute), Biff Brannon (a restaurant owner), Mick Kelly (a young girl), Jake Blount (a drunk) and Benedict Mady Copeland (a doctor).  The book somewhat revolves around Singer who in most cases serves as nothing more than a central hub for the other characters to interact with.  The other characters are all off living their separate lives, rarely interacting with each other, but they all come to confide in Singer, who they all think of as a very intelligent person who understands their viewpoints.  Singer in reality is a fairly simple man who wants nothing more than to see his friend Spiros Antonapoulos who goes insane and is taken to an asylum/hospital early in the book.  As for the other characters, Biff is a man who simply takes life as it comes, and he tends to focus more on the past than anything currently going on, he is a very stoic character, and was very annoying to read.  Mick is the only optimistic character of the group in the book, and while her sections were probably the easiest to get through, she also doesn't change in her personality very much.  Jake is a person who believes that he has a great overall truth and in trying to express his truth moves from town to town.  And Copeland is a black doctor who is working to improve living conditions for blacks in the South.    Setting    The book is set in a small town in the Southeastern U.S.  Although I don't believe we are ever told the name of the town in the book, it really isn't important to the story.    Plot    This is where I think the book falls flat, there really isn't much of an overall plot to this book.  Essentially we are shown a group of people who all are struggling to get through life's ups and downs, but that's all that this really is, a snapshot of life in the southern U.S. in the late 1930s.  I didn't really get much character growth throughout the story, but each person just goes about their life, dealing with theobstacles that come up.    Enjoyment    Parts of this book were interesting, and parts were absolutely horrid to me.  Although the book somewhat centers on Singer, I  actually don't know what purpose he served in the book other than a way for the author to get the characters to talk to him so that we can hear their thoughts while in a conversational form rather than just them thinking about it.  It also seems that several of the characters were in the book simply to talk about the evils of fascism and how a more Marxist ideal of socialism and everybody getting what they need are better than the current system.  There were several times when I became irritated with the book and probably would have put it down if I hadn't been reading it for my class.    The book also suffers from some questionable editing to me, for example, I quickly got sick of reading about a character who \\"lighted up a cigarette.\\"  If it's within someone's dialect, sure say `lighted,' but if it's in the narrative, please say `lit.'  There was also a huge difference between the speech of Copeland and his daughter Portia.  Copeland's speech is almost too perfect for everyday use, whereas Portia's speech is shown to be a very southern dialect.  This difference between them irritated me greatly.    Overall Grade    The book wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be based upon the first third of the book, but it wasn't all that great either.  I read books for an escape from everyday life, not to see how a group of characters that I never identified with get through everyday life.    4/10

B003PIUC02|3.0|The series is great with an amazing story but just a bit too much \\"over the top\\" gore for me. If you love blood and guts and raw slashing views of the internal human anatomy as well as feeling like your covered in blood... then this is the series for you!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I have to admit that this is one cool album.  It's different than anything she has done and it seems like she is trying out her vocal range more on this album than ever before.  A lot of people are complaining that there is too much autotune in this album, but I didn't really notice it.  There is not a single song on this album that I would skip over.  If you're a fan, its a definite \\"must buy.\\"  Enjoy!
B004RUF9DC|1.0|It's interesting that in the same week we get a terrific transfer of \\"The Ten Commandants\\" form 1956, we get this horrible mess that is \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" made in 1965. There is no excuse for MGM/Fox to release this recycled mess of a transfer on bluray other than pure greed, This film was shot in Ultra Panavision 70 and part of it's worth is the great photography Greoge Stevens worked out for this feature so it deserves a MUCH better presentation than this. This print appears to be from a jittery 35mm print found in the back closet somewhere. I'm convinced it's the same lousy print used for the DVD release. The image is all  grainy and.....well, why go on. They just pressed a bluray of a rotten recycled transfer to make a few bucks. They must feel guilty because they aren't charging much for it. MGM/Fox should be ashamed of this. If they can't find a decent HD transfer or original print don't bother to release low def garbage on bluray. This should be recalled.<br /><br />If you must own this film get the DVD as the grain and dirt on the print are not as noticeable.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Others here have done a great job of elaborating on this release from Britney. All I have to say in addition is that this is possibly her best with a combination of high quality, contemporary songs and a joyous exploration of her expressiveness on her part. Haters just don't get it that with her, its the delivery. And no one I have heard delivers the dynamics and emotions of this sort of music like Britney. Over the course of a good song she can take you through the back alleys of your heart with the stars above. And those who criticize don't get the difference between how she delivers on \\"cute\\" sexiness as opposed to the gutter others perform from. Saw her on the Circus tour and I have heard 20,000 people pour their love out at her feet like no show I have ever been to. She knows what she is doing as an artisit and her abilities are real.    She commands this record and if you are a Britney listener this is a must have. I'm only on my second listening and I am smitten.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|With VERY careful use the Turtle Beach Ear Force PX21 lasted only two months.  The left ear piece started making a crackling noise and then eventually went dead to where you could hear ZERO sound in the lest ear.  My kids never touched this headset.  I always carefully placed them on my head and took them off just as carefully.  I treated this headset with as if they would break instantly and although they did not break instantly they lasted only 2 months.<br /><br />The left ear piece issue I describe above is more common than I thought as an online search proved and also comments from other COD gamers confirmed.<br /><br />Thank goodness I bought a squaretrade warranty on these headphones...they already refunded me the money based on the type of warranty I bought through them.<br /><br />This headset is junk...trying another brand.  Perhaps the Tritton Pro for the PS3.

B004EC5IV6|5.0|Finally, after two years of waiting, \\"Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance\\" finally comes to the states! And I have to say: IT WAS GLORIOUS!!! Once again, Hideaki Anno creates a visual feast of filmaking in the world of anime. For those of you who don't know about it, I'll give you the skinny. Anno created \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" in 1995 and it ended with the film \\"The End of Evangelion\\" in 1997. Once the series and films came to the states, it became a worldwide sensation sparking international debate and making significant changes to how anime producers develop anime. \\"Rebiuld of Evangelion\\", the grab-all term for the new four film series, is an attempt to enchance and reimagine the original work with what Anno calls \\"an eye towards the future\\".    STORY: The story of \\"2.22\\" is one that will leave you wanting more. I know it did for me. The characters are all fighting against the Angels in an attempt to protect their world from the Third Impact. If you've watched \\"1.11\\", you'll be at an advantage and will understand the story. For those of you who haven't, you're gonna end up lost without watching it.    PRESENTATION: Once again, studio Khara has done a phenomenal job of upgrading EVA to the next generation. The animation is beautifully detailed and fluid, and the environment look alive and fresh. Every nook and cranky is filled to the brim with detail. Even the CGI animation blends into the handrawn aspects. The harmony of 2D and 3D is so amazing that it almost rivals Stuido Ghibli.    DUB: Now this is were most of you fans are the most anxious. \\"How does the dub sound?\\" Well, Funimation does not dissapoint with their dub. The voices all match perfectly and the dialogue feels fresh and natural. Some may be put off by the swearing in the film, I'm looking at you Mari, but it's really a minor thing.    FINAL VERDICT: All in all, \\"Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance\\" is a beautiful film that does not dissapoint it's audience. Both old and new fans will enjoyit and I highly recommend it to any anime fan.
1597801585|5.0|This book is very good at imagining the political and economic macro-conflicts of a world in which genetic modification has led to catastrophe. The beginning of the book establishes this setting very well; some might find it a slow starter, but I loved this part. The middle of the book was a bit disappointing, as the focus tightened onto the micro-conflicts between the characters who represent those global factions and forces. I did appreciate how well the author was able to juggle so many round characters with strong motivations. The ending returned to the macro level and took some easy shots at capitalism. I'm not sure whether the ending is cynical (greed will prevail) or hopeful. If hopeful, then which hope? The character of the windup girl, who was not very interesting to me, seems to function mainly as a symbol of a posthuman future and \\"change.\\" She represents a very different hope than Kanya's conservatism, nationalism, and isolationism.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|This creation hit the mark squarely between the eyes (and you'd better).  Even though I'd seen much of it done before, it was mostly done with panache and had me getting both chills and bursts of laughter thanks to the snappy dialog, spot on acting and outrageous snippets of homage to the genre.  I am glad I bought it, will watch it all again before the next season hits the deck.

0307593495|3.0|The mysterious disappearance of Linda's prospective father-in-law draws a vacationing and health-distracted Kurt Wallander into the investigation.<br /><br />Memory blackouts which have already landed Wallander in trouble with his superiors and cast him into a funk over aging (though he's only 60) make him a distracted and reluctant participant in the search for the father of his daughter's lover. Still, having met retired naval officer Hakan von Enke at his birthday party Wallander already has a sense the man was worried and had tried to give him a hint of what was bothering him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, rather than being the riveting page-turner we might expect, this political caper and final chapter in the Wallander saga is riddled with plot holes and clich&eacute;s (some of which may be the fault of the translator) which made me almost as tired of the character as his creator appears to be.<br /><br />I may have to go back to some of the earlier novels to restore my faith in both Wallander and Mankell.

0439023521|3.0|I read this series because it was recommended to me, and once I read the first book I wanted to know the ending. This book is about a girl named Katniss who volunteers to take her sister's place in the hunger games. The hunger games is an event that happens every year as a reminder and punishment for defying the capitol, which lead to the destruction of district thirteen. The president requires that a boy and girl (ages 13 to 18) from each of the twelve districts participate in the hunger games, which is a fight to the death. It is televised and all are required to watch and celebrate. This series is very violent and it's unsettling that teens are killing teens, while the capitol views it as a fun game. It is very moving because Katniss sees the wrong in the games (as does many) and tries to protect others, in one scene I found myself in tears. Overall it is a good book and will you keep you wanting to know what is next. Catching Fire is next book in the series and Mocking Jay is the final book.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|To put it simply, this show is wonderful. You'll constantly be guessing and discovering new twists to the story. And, the entire storyline is incredibly well put together. It's as if J.J. Abrams planned the show from start to finish (and, I think he did). If you enjoy sci-fi, you'll most likely enjoy it. And, even if you enjoy a good drama, this will be a great show for you.<br />On the matter of the box set itself, it's very well designed. All of the seasons are laid out well in their individual folding sleeves. The episode guide is very nice. And, the extra few prop replicas are fun to have as well.<br />If you're having a really hard time deciding on whether or not to get it, get it. You'll enjoy it.
0439023513|1.0|I would not recommend this series for young teens due to the violence. I was very disappointed with this book. I enjoyed books one and two, I fell in love with the characters. In this book however they have changed and are completely different people. I understand that their circumstances have caused a change in them, but when all is said and done they never heal. Most of the characters are killed off left and right and I thought it was too much. When the war is over things are just kinda dropped off, and everyone goes their separate ways. There is no hope. The \\"happy ending\\" if you can call it that, is in the epilogue(a page) and does not give enough closure. I walked away feeling empty, not what I expected or hoped for. Now there is talk about a movie??? Be sure to read some other reviews, there are a few good ones that have stated what is missing in this book.
B003DZ6BYI|5.0|I feel this to be an amazing album; the sound found in previous releases is still here. The progressive music is undeniably here. The melodies are sweeter and maybe that is what bothers most of the younger audience listening to Pain of Salvation's music, used to only impossibly loud guitars and very acid riffs. Listen to what was metal from the beginning, metal is not a 90's or 00's movement. Maybe what is falling short here is not the metal in the music but a well rounded knowledge of music on behalf of the listeners. This is a wonderful progressive rock (not only metal) album, just not as hard and acid as the others. One more thing here, the guys at Pain of Salvation have demonstrated here that they can do whatever they want with an amazing quality.

0807014273|5.0|When I was eighteen years old in the spring of 1968, in a book store on the square in Racine, Wisconsin, I found a little book titled Man's Search for Meaning, by philosopher and psychotherapist Victor Frankl. The author survived Auschwitz during the Second World War. He emerged from the death camp having lost everything that mattered to him. His beloved wife was dead, his family was dead, almost all of his friends or acquaintances were dead or dying. He himself was nothing more than a bag of bones, barely clinging to life. In addition he had lost the manuscript of the book he had been writing, the work of his life. He saw no future for himself, and his past contained only suffering and death.<br /><br />In the days after the end of the war when his camp had been liberated by the Allied armies, Frankl said, he<br /><br />\\"...walked through the country past flowering meadows, for miles and miles, toward the market town near the camp. Larks rose to the sky and I could hear their joyous song. There was no one to be seen for miles around; there was nothing but the wide earth and sky and the lark's jubilation and the freedom of space. I stopped, looked around, and up to the sky - and then I went down on my knees. At that moment there was very little I knew of myself or of the world - I had but one sentence in mind - always the same: `I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in the freedom of space.' How long I knelt there and repeated the sentence memory can no longer recall. But I know that on that day, in that hour, my new life started. Step by step I progressed, until I again became a human being.\\"<br /><br />He had felt, for the first time, a spark of hope. That was all he needed to begin living again. He had found a subtle meaning in the beauty of the world and he could use his new consciousness and connection to that beauty as a reason to go on living.<br /><br />Frankl's little book was one of the most important books I've read in my life. When I was eighteen I understood only a bit of what he was trying to say, but it was enough to provide a frame that allowed me to continue my life and to continue learning.<br /><br />We all make meaning from the fragments of our lives, said Frankl, from the beauty of the world around us, from the fragile connections we have with each other. We construct a narrative that allows us to survive because it tells us who we are and what it is we love.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1453843752 The Sword of the Lord: The Roots of Fundamentalism in an American Family]]ly a bit of what he was trying to say, but it was enough to provide a frame that allowed me to continue my life and to continue learning.

0679731369|5.0|Julian Barnes astounds. Just what sort of book is this, anyway? A literary biography of 19th century French novelist, radical, and intellectual impresario Gustave Flaubert? A meditation on the uses and misuses of language? A novel of obsession, denial, irritation, and underhanded connivery? A thriller complete with disguises, sleuthing, mysterious meetings, and unknowing targets? An extended essay on the nature of fiction itself?<br /><br />On the surface, at first, \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" is the tale of an elderly English doctor's search for some intriguing details of Gustave Flaubert's life. Geoffrey Braithwaite seems to be involved in an attempt to establish whether a particularly fine, lovely, and ancient stuffed parrot is in fact one originally \\"borrowed by G. Flaubert from the Museum of Rouen and placed on his worktable during the writing of Un coeur simple, where it is called Loulou, the parrot of Felicite, the principal character of the tale.\\"<br /><br />What begins as a droll and intriguing excursion into the minutiae of Flaubert's life and intellect, along with an attempt to solve the small puzzle of the parrot - or rather parrots, for there are two competing for the title of Gustave's avian confrere - soon devolves into something obscure and worrisome, the exploration of an arcane Braithwaite obsession that is perhaps even pathological. The first hint we have that all is not as it seems comes almost halfway into the book, when after a humorously cantankerous account of the inadequacies of literary critics, Braithwaite closes a chapter by saying, \\"Now do you understand why I hate critics? I could try and describe to you the expression in my eyes at this moment; but they are far too discoloured with rage.\\"<br /><br />And so on. From that point on, things just get curiouser and curiouser, until they end in the most unexpected bang.<br /><br />A passage from the book is perhaps the best way to describe the overall effect of this extraordinary story: \\"You can define a net in one of two ways, depending on your point of view. Normally, you would say that it is a meshed instrument designed to catch fish. But you could, with no great injury to logic, reverse the image and define the net as a jocular lexicographer once did: he called it a collection of holes tied together with string.\\"<br /><br />Julian Barnes demonstrates that it is possible to catch quite an interesting fish no matter how you define the net.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1453843752 The Sword of the Lord: The Roots of Fundamentalism in an American Family]]ending on your point of view.

I was so eager to get my hands on this Blu-ray disc that rather than waiting till it became available in the US I bought it from Amazon.uk in November.  Unfortunately the title from the UK only included text tracks in German and English, which was not good for us since I wanted to share it with my family from Mexico.  The disk from amazon.com sold in the US contains tracks in Spanish, which is why we purchased it.  In fact, this title sold in the US contains an insane amount of text tracks in different languages.  My only comment about the spanish text track is that there are many areas where the translation is not even close to the audio track.  I don't know who handled the spanish translation, but that company needs to find better translators.  In some parts the translation was so bad that it seemed like they were just making stuff up.

B004Q08BE2|1.0|DISCLAIMER PLEASE READ: (a) this review is very long; (b) this review contains spoilers, and (c) this review represents my subjective opinions of a motion picture. If any aspect intimidates or offends you, please read no further.       How far must an artist go to actualize perfection in his work? When must a parent acknowledge an adult child's autonomy and independence? Are exploitation, manipulation, and sexual abuse good tools for a teacher to encourage artistic talent's maturation to its fullest potential? Where exists the ultra-thin boundary separating eccentric genius from psychotic workaholic and when has an artist crossed it? If an actor sinks too deep \\"into character,\\" how does s/he escape?       I didn't enjoy \\"Black Swan.\\" It's not that I don't comprehend the significant themes visited in the film. It's not I don't appreciate the film's good points (nice music and cinematography, pretty good costumes and sets, great casting.) It's not that I lack analytical ability or intellectual refinement. I watched \\"Black Swan\\" twice and took a day to consider what I liked and disliked about the film and it ultimately boiled down to the mediocre storyline, poor writing (especially dialogue) and the excessive pornographic content disguised as \\"art\\" in the movie.       What I Really Liked:     1) The ballet performances were lovely, not earth-shattering, but very well acted. The backlash concerning Portman's dance is ridiculous. Portman is a film star who trained for a year so she wouldn't make a fool of herself portraying a prima ballerina. She achieved that. She isn't the next Gelsey Kirkland, don't expect the polished precision of a world-class professional ballerina who's done the same work for years. Portman and Kunis dance competently and both actresses interject beautiful emotion and physical acting into their admittedly brief dance scenes. I would've liked seeing more ballet performed in the film with or without the actresses. The film's opening scene really captured me and I enjoyed the final performance. I simply wanted to see more of it. There are some interesting special effects I felt neither enhanced nor detracted from the dance.     2) I found the soundtrack compelling, charming, and eerily beautiful. I believe Peter Tcaikovsky, a very innovative composer in his own day, would be enchanted by Clint Mansell's compositions reimagining his work. At times familiar, in other places creepily original, the soundtrack helps carry this film.     3) Costumes, sets, and lighting: almost always, these elements were carefully neutral which forced viewers' attention onto the actors and actresses (physical action, body language, and spoken dialogue.) The cast's clothing and accessories seemed color coordinated to identify the darker characters and the lighter ones. Lily always wears black or charcoal. Nina wears lots of white and girly pale pink.     4) Casting: the talent was very good and well-suited to their respective roles. Natalie Portman's character, Nina, carries most of the work and Portman did a fine job. Whatever my opinion of the movie, I applaud Portman's hard work in interpreting a complicated role. Dance involves acting and Portman portrayed a dancer portraying a character to whom the dancer could not relate. Portman earned her Oscar.     Supporting actress Mila Kunis's Lily provided an excellent foil to Nina. Barbara Hershey (Nina's controlling mother) makes the most of the material she's given and does surprisingly well. I wasn't never fully convinced what Mom's motives were. On the one hand, she came across as frighteningly intrusive and controlling. At the same time, I think the script hinted Mom's awareness of and concern for her daughter's fragile mental state. She seemed to want Nina to succeed, but also protect her from success.     Winona Ryder makes waves as drama queen Beth McIntyre, the company's former prima ballerina who's not handling her pending retirement gracefully. For the pittance of screen timeshe has, Ryder knows how to draw attention to herself.     Finally, Vincent Cassel portrays Thomas Leroy, the most thankless role in the film, a stereotypical, Eurotrash ballet director and unapologetic sexual predator eager to take advantage of a newer, younger prima ballerina now that Beth's retiring. This guy is smarmy, gross, and prone to coaching his principles during rehearsal with helpful comments like, \\"David, can I ask you? Honestly, would you f*(k that girl? ... Nina, your dancing is just as frigid ... \\" I literally gagged when he informed Nina, \\"I'll be the prince\\" as he took over the male lead so he could grope and fondle Nina in order to inspire the \\"passion\\" Nina lacks to channel the Black Swan. Cassel's a very good villain. I would let this slime work with my daughter when elephants roost in trees.       What I Really Disliked:     1) The ambiguous storyline reaches \\"fiction that doesn't make sense\\" mode. Ambiguity is a natural result of Nina's unreliable perspective, but too much is never resolved. \\"Black Swan\\" could easily be one of those films or shows where the protagonist wakes up and realizes s/he was only dreaming, daydreaming, in a coma, hallucinating due to illness/injury from which s/he has recovered, etc.. Those scenarios, even when well done, always leave me feeling a bit ripped off.       2) Unlikeable Characters: I don't like a single personality in this film. These are not flawed, relatable human people, these are unlikeable, unpleasant human people with every wart on show. Even the bit characters behave abominably (i.e., Veronica cursing out Nina and accusing her of \\"making sick jokes\\" after Nina, misled by LeRoy, congratulates the dancer on her successful audition for the Swan Queen.)       Most of the characters are shockingly amoral. Drug abuse, one night stands, suicide and/or attempted suicide, and self-mutilation are all on the menu. Nina also vomits frequently; it's unclear if she is bulimic or if her vomiting is symptomatic ofother problems.     Every character lacked depth, including Nina. One thing that struck me during my second viewing is that I never got the impression Nina really loved ballet. That disturbed me the more I considered it. I mean, the entire point of the movie is Nina's struggle for knowledge/experience to do her role justice. She didn't seem to love dance, or even like it much. Obsession isn't necessarily love. Nina's loveless obsession with dance would have bothered me less had the film shown us what or who Nina DID love or care about.       What I can't Stand:       1) The dialogue is awful. Just awful. There is nothing natural, flowing, or normal in how people speak to each other in this film.       2) \\"Black Swan\\" contains heavy sexual content, most of it a gratuitous distraction from the main plot (or maybe it's intended to distract viewers from the plot's flimsiness and help fill in film time.) I admit I'm usually turned off by too much nudity or sex in a movie, and this was just ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is the possibility these experiences are actually Nina's hallucinations. Make no mistake, this movie is pornographic. This isn't erotic content, the sexual excesses do not court an emotional response in the viewer, nor are the scenes titillating.       How much sex is in this film? Shenanigans start about 50 minutes into the film and continue almost to the end.       A) Leroy forces himself upon Nina during a rehearsal session, kissing and groping her ... then leaving her high and dry and terming his behavior \\"me seducing you, but it needs to be the other way around.\\" What planet is Leroy (or the writer who created Leroy) from? Seriously, Nina is not the only one in need of regular contact with a qualified mental health care professional. Leroy isn't sexy or seductive, he's gross.       B) Nina masturbates several times. Each masturbatory \\"session\\" involves a bizarre \\"payoff.\\" In one situation Nina is deeply \\"into\\" it and discovers her mother sound asleep in a chair alongside her bed. While dozing and masturbating in the bathtub, Nina hallucinates Lily spitting or dropping blood on her (sounds real sexy, huh? NOT!)       C) On a train, Nina is victimized by ANOTHER pervy old guy (I guess Leroy's perviness isn't sufficient.) Her fellow passenger blows kisses at her and fondles his crotch while she struggles to look away and pretend nothing is happening. Apparently, phoning the authorities isn't an option.       D) Nina and Lily sexuality -- just plain gratuitous and in poor taste. Yes, I know a dozen people are gonna chime in, \\"But it's so meaningful! It demonstrates Nina's desperation to free herself of her white swan persona and seek relief from her mother's intrusive, domineering control.\\" I found it disruptive and irrelevant. Lily is an obvious \\"frenemy\\" to Nina and a completely unbelieveable character (frequently late to rehearsals, living a busy night life, sexually promiscuous, a substance abuser) NOTE: Nina also fantasizes Lily smothers her with an accent pillow after orally pleasuring her, but no reviewers are complaining THAT portion of her \\"escapist fantasy\\" wasn't depicted in greater detail. Hardy har har.       E) Nina hallucinates Lily having sex with another dancer, costumed as Von Rothbart, in the studio.       Yes, folks, this passes for Oscar nominee material in the 21st century. Maybe if the creators axed some of the porn and wrote in a bit more story, this film might have actually gone somewhere.       I'd rate \\"Black Swan\\" 3 stars for the talent, music, and the cinematography if the film revealed a worthwhile, engaging story.  The purpose of film is to entertain, and this film does not do that.  One star is the best rating I can offer BS due to its failings as an engaging storytelling vehicle.

0739343823|3.0|REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I love Grisham's writing style.  I was engaged all the way through.  There was good action and a lot of suspense.  By the end I was amazed, impressed, and intrigued with all the planning, strategizing, and how things worked out.  It may not be believable but it was fun.  Then the ending was frustrating and unhappy.  I WANT HAPPY ENDINGS.  Unfortunately that was my only problem with the book.  I loved the experience.  The only thing positive about the end was that it was thought provoking.  I had to tell myself yes I could see that.  But it's not a story I want to hear.  I normally would give this book a below average rating due to the ending, but because the rest was so good, I compromised at 3 stars.  For someone who would enjoy smart-thinking, out-thinking others, and a good suspenseful read, go ahead.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Patrick worked for a law firm that was about to receive 90 million dollars from a lawsuit, 60 million of which would go to their client Arecio.

Arecio and two insurance companies hire Stephano to find Patrick.  They have just found him.  They kidnap and torture him asking \\"Where is the money?\\"  Eva is a Brazilian lawyer who helps Patrick during this time.<br /><br />The narrator Frank Muller is great.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|This film won the Oscar for Best Documentary for 2010 and once you view it, you will agree.    Matt Damon narrates on what caused the collapse of Wall Street back in 2008.  Greedy banks pushed for deregulation which allowed them to gamble more money on the market than what they could afford.  They increased the risks by accepting mortgages from homeowners who could ill afford paying the monthly mortgages just so they could make profits on the commissions on the processed loans.  They then sold these bad loans to investment firms (retirement funds, pensions and unions) making even more in commissions and insured them with AIG because they knew the loans were bad, making even more profits.    The whole scheme collapsed when the investment firms finally got wise to the banks crooked deals and no one could sell the bad loans to anyone so everyone took trillions in severe losses and ended up with the government bailing them all out on our dime.    The ominous end shows that while President Obama wanted to reregulate the banks, the current majority in the Senate and House (who are sponsored by the banks) rejected the laws.  Meanwhile, banks are pushing even for more deregulation to further their profits on even riskier deals which they cannot afford, knowing that Uncle Sam will bail them out.    And what happened to the con artists that caused this financial mess?  Nothing but profiting billions of dollars... Because what they did, making profits on sales is not illegal.  What they did do, making sales on loans that they knew to be bad to the public is morally wrong.  Their defense was that everyone has their own duty to check out what they are investing in.    If at the end of this movie you are not disgusted and enraged on what caused our economy to tank and to cause our government to go into severe debt, you only have yourself to blame when this happens again...

B004KSQN7C|3.0|Lets be honest here ?  \\"BlackOut and Circus\\" are far more superior projects than this. This effort isn't as cohesive as the previous two, nor does it have the creativity or the stylization of the previous two efforts. BlackOut was  was a milestone of Britney's career and showed complete evolution. \\"Circus\\" was a great continuation of that evolution. This is definitely a step down in my opinion..NO, it is a step down lets be honest. With the exception of \\"Inside Out, I Wanna Go and Trip to your heart. The rest of the album kinda sounds like filler or outtakes or quite similar. \\"Til the World ends\\" is a great starter song but after that I expected more. The album just to me doesn't blend together well nor does it have the darkness of the previous two efforts. Nor do I feel the songs have character and will stick with you after 10 listens. It just seems like there were different producers thrown in the pot to see what sticks this time. \\"Madonna\\" did it best on \\"Confessions on the Dance-floor\\". If Britney is trying to make a dance album she failed on this one its far from it. Mann I will be glad when JT returns, music has really taken a leap. This isn't a bad album by any means but I just would have expected more after the previous two efforts. Even Britneys bonus tracks on her last album were better than some of the ones that made it on here. Where are the tracks like Phonography, Out from Under and Unusual you, Mannequin, Blur and Kill the Lights. Listen to the quality of those tracks and Blackouts and you tell me if theres a difference.  Its like she took a budget cut or something or they couldn't get those guys back. Even the Itunes bonus track \\"Trouble\\" is better than some of the junk on here. She worked with the legendary Guys Sigsworth on the last lp which is classic. This is the guy responsible for Madonna, Mandalay, Imogen heap and Bjork. I am giving this 3 stars ONLY because it is better than what is out there right now. But in my opinion for Britney, this just isn't good enough sorry. Maybe she should have taken a little more time off ..that's just my opinion. This is coming from someone that knows good music and listens to real artist. And her last two lps showed that she was very capable of that. I think Christina Auguilera's bonus disc took more chances than this on her Bionic album. And that's really sad considering I am not much of a fan of her previous efforts. This is coming from a person that listens to artist like , Timbaland, Madonna, Ladytron and IAMX. But this is just a bit too childish for my taste not the mature Britney I was happy about in the last 5 years.

This movie was full of romance, laughter, tears, SEX, and learning the true value of life and how to love yourself and another one truly.  Jake was a self-centered individual who thrive of bedding women and looking out for himself, meanwhile Anne was going through life by pretending not to have a care to compensate for the fact that she believed no one should be able to love her and her disease truly.

0756404738|5.0|I just finished reading WMF for the second time. In anticipation of reading this book,I re-read Name of the Wind to refresh myself on anything I may have forgotten.  As many people who read the first book multiple times can tell you, there is no way to pick up all the subtleties in the first reading. The same is true of WMF. That's why I waited to post my review.     After my first reading, I tended to agree with many of the less than thrilled reviewers who griped about pacing, and lack of plot advancement. SPOILERS AHEAD: Kvothe spent way too much time at the University, with nothing more than a few larks to keep him occupied, his time chasing the bandits and with the Adem seemed overlong as well, then his return to his friends and the conclusion to the novel felt woefully underserved. END SPOILER.    However, Rothfuss' prose is some of the most beautiful, lyrical and moving that it has ever been my pleasure to read, his characterizations are lush, unconventional and surprising, and his ability to wring humor or drama from a moment is, I think, unmatched by any modern writer. His writing and my love for the characters kept me going, and got me to immediately reread the book. I'm very glad I did. So much that seemed haphazard, overlong and coincidental all of a sudden clicked into place and revealed itself to be nothing short of brilliant. For those that say the plot was not sufficiently advanced, they haven't read deeply enough. The plot has been significantly advanced. It just hasn't been spoon fed. It's all in the layers, and many of them are too subtle to notice unless you're reading the book a second time and have the first book close to hand for reference. I could list a couple of dozen asides, minor observations, connections etc., but I don't want to bullet point a whole bunch of spoilers. Suffice it to say that I now strongly disagree with those who say that the plot is not sufficiently advanced in the second book.    For those that say that Kvothe's character has not evolved enough in the second book, I wholeheartedly disagree, even on the first reading. He's gone from precocious, brilliant but still insecure boy in the first book (talking about the tale within the tale as it were) to SMALL SPOILER: true warrior, wizard minstrel and the attendant reputation in the second. END SPOILER.    The world that Rothfuss evokes is one of the richest I've ever encountered, and belongs up there with Dune, Middle Earth, and Earthsea (to which this series definitely owes a debt in regards to its rules of magic concerning names). It comes complete with its own creation myth, currency, calendar, social mores, mythology, music, nursery rhymes, bigotries, history, political structures, and none of it is random or superfluous. Of course, many fantasy novels create their own maps,races, cultures etc. but how many times have we seen ideas introduced in sequel books or subsequent  volumes that seem like they came out of the clear blue sky and were clearly something the author just thought of and stuck into his/her world as something they thought was cool, even though there had never been a hint of anything like it in previous volumes? This is definitely not the case here. Everything, and I mean every apparently new idea or concept, introduced in WMF has its roots in NOTW, richly coloring in the lines of the sketch introduced in the first book. It is in these elaborations that much of the story advancement happens.    So what is wrong with the book, IMHO? Not too sound nitpicky, but for me it's really a question of timeline and geography. (the following may be SPOILERISH, but not really, but caveat emptor regardless).  Here are two examples (and there are others) :    - If Kvothe was at the University before The Chronicler, and Kvothe seems like he's now at most 25, and we know that he was at University until he was at least almost 18, then when did Chronicler have the time to both go to University and build up his reputation as a collectorof stories (not to mention that the first book that Kvothe reads at University is Chronicler's Myth of the Common Draccus)? In WMF, Chronicler clearly implies that he was at University after Kvothe. Even if he attended years previously, left to write the book, then come back after Kvothe had left to gather the stories, it doesn't track for various reasons.    -In NOTW, Kvothe makes it to Trebon in a few hours only by almost killing a magnificent horse riding hell bent for leather. Yet in WMF, the implication is that a teenage girl can make it from Trebon to University and back by boat before her mother realizes she's gone in the late afternoon.    There are also some simple logic questions:  - Why, now that Kvothe has a somewhat established life, does he not reach out to Abenthy or Baron Greyfallow? Either, I'm sure, would be happy to sponsor him or find him a patron.  - Especially with regards to Abenthy, why not seek him out and ask him about the Chandrian? He'd be almost guaranteed to believe Kvothe's story as he truly knows how special Kvothe is.  - Why would Denna object to Kvothe's stating that the Lanre story is fact not fiction, when she herself saw the destruction of the farm in Trebon and knows that no natural power committed the carnage?    Anyway, the above are mere quibbles. The book is fantastic, and I highly recommend the series to anyone who loves great fantasy and beautiful prose. I don't think there's a chance in hell that Rothfuss can finish the story in a single trilogy, and I for one am glad. He may be able to get through the rest of Kvothe's backstory in Day 3, but that's a lot of threads to tie up in the present.  I have a feeling we'll be following the ongoing saga after book 3, and that's a lovely thing.

B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Imagine a cross between \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"Murder She Wrote,\\" set in a quaint Maine town where weird things happen every week.<br /><br />That's the best description I can come up with for \\"Haven,\\" a paranormal crime show very loosely adapted from Stephen King's novel \\"The Colorado Kid.\\" The first season starts off on a rather mediocre note with a string of one-off \\"troubles,\\" but slowly develops a mysterious arc that grows more intriguing and powerful as time passes.<br /><br />FBI agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is sent to the town of Haven to find an escaped murderer... but as soon as she arrives, she finds that the guy is dead... and his death was physically impossible.<br /><br />Not only does Haven have some bizarre people and strange weather patterns, but Audrey finds that she has a connection to the place -- an old photo with a woman who looks just like her. So she decides to stay in Haven, and partners up with local cop Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryan) to solve local crimes while she searches for hints to her past.<br /><br />However, it turns out that the \\"troubles\\" are returning to Haven after thirty-ish years -- mysterious aging, outbreaks of madness and sanity, spontaneously rotting food, horrible deaths related to artwork, a shadowy \\"Dark Man\\" (no, not the one Stephen King fans are thinking of!), a deadly shapeshifter, fiery deaths, a poltergeist and countless ground cracks.<br /><br />\\"Haven Season 1\\" takes a little time to bloom. At first the acting is stiff, the one-off plots are ordinary, and there's no strong overarcing plot except \\"the troubles are back!\\" But as time goes by, the stories get darker and the writing becomes more compelling -- especially since only some of the mysteries center around stuff you can arrest people for.<br /><br />Each episode introduces a new bizarre occurrence, and has Nathan and Audrey trying to unravel whose powers are going out of control. These mysteries are fairly clever, and there are some funny moments sprinkled in every episode (\\"I need a HUUUUUGG!\\"). And despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes. Eww.<br /><br />Emily Rose is kind of stiff in the first few episodes, but she becomes a really likable heroine by the halfway point of the series -- she's strong, compassionate, playful and has some shocking secrets of her own. Bryan plays Nathan as reclusive and quiet, mainly because he can't physically feel anything. And there are some solid side performances by Eric Balfour as a charming smuggler, Nicholas Campbell as the gruff sheriff, and Anne Caillon as Nathan's girlfriend.<br /><br />\\"Haven\\" hasn't fully unfolded into the great show it might become, but the first season shows it starting to really bloom -- and leaves you wanting more.despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes.

B004FGMV0W|5.0|If you wanted more shallow, pretentious music, this is NOT the album for you.  If you wanted more forced expletives added for shock value in her songs, this is NOT the album for you.  If you wanted more one-dimensional singing/screaming, this is NOT the album for you.  If you were enamored with her last album, this is DEFINITELY NOT the album for you.    But if you wanted an album that showcases Avril's melodic voice, and if you wanted an album where she wrote songs that were deeply personal and that she really poured her heart into singing about, and if you wanted an album the world at large could take her seriously for and give her the accolades she so deserves, then THIS is the album you've been waiting for.    In the album, \\"Goodbye Lullaby,\\" Avril strikes out in a totally new direction, and this makes it her best effort to date.  There were glimpses of this sprinkled throughout her previous albums, but you could really see the seeds sown for her latest album in \\"Innocence,\\" from her last album, \\"The Best Damn Thing.\\"    In the song, \\"I Love You,\\" you can hear the deep emotions lying just under the surface, and I wouldn't doubt that she needed a few takes to get all the way through it.    Avril's voice soars through \\"Everybody Hurts\\" and invites you along on a journey with her through her soul.    These are not complicated songs, but the best ones usually aren't.  \\"What the Hell\\" is an attempt to placate the fans she picked up from her last album, but it seems out of place.  Not bad, just out of place.    So there you have it.  If this were a perfume, I'd call it \\"Essence of  Avril,\\" for it is indeed Avril stripped of all pretense and distilled into a little package that is a joy to apply.  Not that I apply perfume, mind you.  Forget what I said about the perfume and enjoy the album.

B004LFO0FG|3.0|** 1/2<br /><br />What is it about Britney Spears that makes her a superstar? It's definitely not her voice; even her fans can admit she's not a strong singer. She used to be a fantastic dancer, but since knee surgery a few years back, her moves aren't what they used to be. She's a cute girl, sure, but cute girls are a dime a dozen.<br /><br />Maybe it's her mystique. After all, after being in the public eye for over a decade, I still have no idea who this Britney Spears person is. Her songs, cute and catchy as they often are, reveal nothing about her as a person. Her videos, bombastic and sexy as they are, offer no intimacy. Even during her \\"meltdown\\", it was impossible to tell what was real and what was staged.<br /><br />\\"Femme Fatale,\\" her latest product, continues to offer no hint of who the real Britney Spears is. The songs are dizzying, slick, and sugary, but Britney's vocals are so processed she sounds like a robot most of the time, and the generic lyrics speak of nothing other than partying, sex, and boys.<br /><br />I listened to this on the elliptical machine. It did the job ... the beats kept me going. But the music, as much as it tries to suggest sex, offers no real intimacy, passion, or emotion. It's the sonic equivalent of having sex with a Fembot in the bathroom of a gay bar.

I finally listened to these books, via audible, and I was pleasantly surprised.
0688014291|4.0|This classic allegorical tale is a helpful first step into the world of management. Whether you are a business owner, division supervisor, politician, or pastor, this book can help you manage people in a few easy steps. Indeed, not only are the concepts simple, but the book itself is quick read by any standard.<br /><br />With over 100 Amazon reviews, let me just say this: any reader could likely get the gist of the book by simply consulting the pocket-size \\"Game Plan\\" near the end of the book. This summarizes the key elements involved in being a One-Minute Manager: One-Minute Goal Setting, One-Minute Praising, and One-Minute Reprimands. The chart is a little weak on \\"Goal Setting\\" but the information is outlined (on its own page) early on in the book for further consultation.<br /><br />For the beginner this is a great resource. For the experienced this is a good reminder, yet will likely be regarded a bit too simplistic.
0446401307|5.0|\\"The music helped Bosch smooth out his thoughts. He realized the case was shifting. The feds, at least, were chasing the missing cesium instead of the killers. There was a subtle difference there that Bosch thought was important. He knew that he needed to keep his focus on the overlook and not lose sight at any time of the fact that this was a murder investigation.\\"           The Overlook, by Michael Connelly, is a mystery/ thriller novel that tells the story of a homicidal detective in L.A named Harry Bosch. Bosch is challenged with a case where physicist, Stanley Kent is murdered at Mulholland Drive, near the overlook. Harry comes to realize that the killer intends to obtain cesium, a radioactive nuclear material, from this physicist, in order to scheme some sort of plot. According to Kent's wife, who seemed strangely suspicious, the men seemed to be speaking some sort of Arabic language she couldn't comprehend. Bosch clashes heads with LAPD and the FBI, seeing this case as a possible \\"terrorist threat.\\" Bosch also happens to team-up with former-lover Rachel Walling, to capture the alleged terrorist/killer whom could reap havoc among many cities in the United States with nuclear material he possesses.      This review is from: The Overlook (Paperback) If you are one of those people who like to read novels about enticing mystery murder cases, this book is for you.  This book is one of Connelly's less complex novels, but interests the reader more than the others due to its intriguing plot and unique reason for one's murder. I really enjoyed this conspiracy-driven book and was disappointed when it came to the end. This book is very similar to Connelly's other novels in the way that they are based around murders, but one key difference unseen in every book but The Overlook, was the way that Bosch can show much composure, making the case seem deceptively easy. If you want a fairly short, attention-grabbing novel, The Overlook, is just right for you! I would give this asolid 5 out of 5 stars.    -Drew Schneider (Langley High School)    [[ASIN:0446401307 The Overlook (Harry Bosch)]]

B004FVHBXY|3.0|INCEPTION could have been named INCEPTIONS or CONVOLUTIONS and a movie promo might say \\"Take notes or your mind will melt\\". For me, viewing number three was more scrutable and less frustrating; at my rate I may even get to enjoying it by, say, the fifth or sixth time. There's a plus point: you can see it again and again and be surprised.     Who does the whats and hows, how consequences unfold or wrinkle every which way depends on your concentration. I refuse to take notes, so maybe new synapses are being burned in m'brain every time through. Or around and around.     For some who get off on Rubik Cubes, chess and the on-line memory enhancement sites this puzzler of a picture will be embraced. Those who view movies for easy entertainment... Well, I bet Amazon has pain killers to mail to you.    The number of stars I assigned relate not to the quality of the movie, action, effects or Leonardo, they're all fine; but to the percentage of people I think who can comfortably handle this maze. Other movies which are complex puzzlers, but more accessible and entertaining would be [[ASIN:B0018O4YSQ Dark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000N6UERK Deja Vu [Blu-ray]]] (I chose Blu-ray versions because their graphics are so rich and key in both).    Hey, who says movies should be just things to watch while chomping popcorn? See INCEPTION a few times and you might get smarter. How much so depends on you and your patience.

0439023521|4.0|A fast-paced, futuristic adventure story about teens being forced to fight like gladiators.  The action never stops and the story is full of romance, amazing technology and teenage angst.  The questions brought up by the premise are various.

B003Y5H55G|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost flicks (HOT FUZZ, SHAUN OF THE DEAD). When I saw the trailer for PAUL, I knew I had to see it. And the result was pleasantly surprising. The humor is crude and, at times, very British. There are also a number of jokes and references only nerds will understand. But these are exactly the reasons I love this movie. Simon and Nick pay homage to ComiCon and Star Wars, while making fun of the deep south and theology. If vulgar, blasphemous, or otherwise profane jokes offend you, I wouldn't recommend this film. However, if you're a nerd with an ounce of humor, PAUL is for you. (4 Stars)

Come on, chicks fighting clockwork Nazis? How could I miss that? And I'm beyond glad I decided to purchase a ticket.<br /><br />SUCKER PUNCH is a metaphor within a dream. Not everyone is going to \\"get\\" the film and instead will criticize it as a simple romp through a 13-year-old boy's wet dream. But the point of this story was not the sexualization of the women, but how they took it back and overcame it. The striking visual effects and unrealistic video-game-esque scenes were artistically and purposefully done. Snyder uses such outrageous fights as a five-foot tall girl versus 100-foot Samurai statues to tell the story of the strength of a group of women against enormous odds.<br /><br />I loved the film. I loved the soundtrack. I loved the effects. I loved the story. I'd ignore the critics on this one and try it for yourself.

B004NSULHM|1.0|Does Radiohead actually write music anymore, or has their creative direction permanently shifted to ambient noise and sampled drivel?  I would suggest the latter, particularly after listening to THE KING OF LIMBS.    The time-honored (dishonored?) tradition of killing organized sound with abuse of a synthesizer is continued on this miserable record.  The entire album sounds as though Thom Yorke was, perhaps literally, flailing wildly at a keyboard and a sampler and recording the resultng din.  Most of this album is without melody, unlike previous albums.  Much of the rest of the band can't be heard over whatever is eminating from my speakers, and I can hardly understand half of the lyrics.  In my viewpoint, such sporadic and inconsistent keyboard hammering was never, is not, and never will be music, nor will it ever contribute anything to any song.    I was bored and disinterested as all get-out while trying to listen to it.  Besides perhaps \\"Codex,\\" nothing was memorable.
B004IJZFP4|5.0|The vocals on Lotus sound a little muddy (but the extended jams are great on this song), the jam on Wild Dogs runs a bit long, and the version of Savannah Woman is no where near as good as the original (it's more of a rock version, while the original is jazzier), but this Deluxe CD has many fine moments, along with the inclusion of an excellent version of Crazed Fandango (and an alternate take as a bonus track too). All in all, is this as good as the original album? I can't say--they're different and if you're a fan of the original, you will enjoy hearing these alternate takes on the songs. The sound quality is very good, and the CD is overall every bit as enjoyable as the original album, they're just different! So, if you like Teaser, think of this as a Teaser remix with some extended jamming and a few slight changes here and there, with an extra song (Crazed Fandango) that was not on the original album. Overall very good and must have for any fan of Tommy Bolin--but I say again you should really get the original album too!

I can't stop listening to it! Especially the song Trade Mistakes, it starts out very beautiful, but once the chorus hits, it goes hard!!! I recommend this album to everyone!!!
0316069485|3.0|Very readable, very enjoyable but I would have  liked the story line to go differently at the end. Can't say more without spoiling the story for others.
B004TLM284|1.0|I have been able to listen to several of Britney's tracks (not songs) on YouTube from pretty much all of her albums, after many of the mindless drones who make up most of her fanbase keep telling me how \\"great\\" she is. After yet another one of them told me I should check out Femme Fatale, I went right ahead with it. After all, I can't really criticize anything until I've heard it, right? So now, I can honestly say that this one, just like all the others, is nothing but garbage. Auto-tuned filth, lame and overly-simple generic lyrics, over-processed computerized noise... no substance whatsoever, just total garbage!<br /><br />Come on, people, wake up and smell the coffee! Britney is a hack, and nothing but hype. She is just in it for the money, and not the art. And if you ask me, she is (thankfully) just about over the hill by now. As evidence of this, Femme Fatale may have debuted at #1, but despite that, it spawned virtually ZERO grammy nominations! Enough said.<br /><br />With all that said, please allow me to return to Within Temptation, Halestorm, Gamma Ray and many dozens more REAL bands/artists who actually make music for the art and not solely for the money.<br /><br />NOTE: The actual date of this post is April 13, 2012. I wrote my original review on March 30, 2011, but deleted it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun addition to the angry birds series. I look forward to the updates that are already being shown with the date to be released.

B004KAB5QO|5.0|Oliver who lives in London, pays a visit to an old Cambridge professor of his who he has genuinely become friends with over the years. During his visit to Theo he notices a painting that has a unusual mascaraed scene in it. Oliver was instantly drawn to it asking Theo questions of how he acquired the piece. Theo in response told him, I would like to tell you a story, mostly for my sake, to alleviate some of the burden. Theo's story started with how he came across the painting at an auction, & won the paintings auction. Immediately after a mysterious man appeared and wanted to purchase the painting for any price Theo named. He refused and the man told him he would regret it. After some time he had the painting at his home when one day the light hit it just right and a mysterious man appeared in the masquerade scene, being dragged to a boat on the canal by two men, with a distress look about him. He had never noticed before in the painting.<br /><br />After a series of spooky happenings Oliver is contacted by a duchess who extended an invitation to her country home to talk to him about the painting. Wearily he arrived and met the duchess, who was probably well into her nineties. She wanted the painting and Theo knew it, but the story she told of the painting and the history of it was astounding and down right creepy. This one I check out from the library.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a great book!  If you liked the first two then you'll surely like this. I couldn't put it down, but was then frustrated that it ended!  I would have loved to see this series continue on.
0756951410|5.0|It is a tragedy in this world that people hurt children, it is a withdrawn subject to me and one that I choose not to ever touch on in my readings. I do not have a stomach for violence but violence with children involved hits a breaking point for me that I just cannot do. I purposely stayed away from this book because I was scared and I knew that a girl was brutally murdered but when I saw that maidens court had read it I knew it was time. I had to stomach the violence to see what all the fuss was about. I was in a dark mood the day I picked it up and happened to pick the off-handed read to change up the mix, I am glad I did.<br /><br />As I braced myself for the read I found Susie Salmon, \\"Salmon like the fish\\" was in junior high in the early seventies. She was fourteen when her demonic pedophile neighbor Mr Harvey viciously murdered her. The murder happened with in the first few chapters because death was not the end of Susie Salmon. I instantly loved Susie as every woman could relate to being an innocent young girl in that awkward phase of life. She deserved to transcend directly to that place where lost loved ones waited with open arms to greet you. Something was transpiring and Susie found herself in a limbo place where people who could not move forward stayed in their own world, like a waiting room for heaven. Her little brother Buckley said it was the \\"in-between\\" part of Earth and heaven.<br /><br />In the in-between Susie watched, she saw her family struggle with the loss that had no resolution. In my mind I have always felt that to loose a child at any age is a devastating event that many families are never able to recover from. To be just lost is worse because you never get the much needed closure. Susie found she did not have closure in her heaven either and she remained where she was and continued watching the time go by. The family changed the kids were growing up, mom had run off with her grief that was like a crushing weight. Her grandma moved in even if she was dysfunctional in the beginning, but with in it all they had each other still the core that mattered was intact. What kind of closure could there be for the girl that only her elbow was found? I was not really sure, I do not even think Susie knew what it was until it came in another unexpected form. I own this book.functional in the beginning, but with in it all they had each other still the core that mattered was intact.

B004518W9G|3.0|When it works is really great with shifts and all plus great pitch.  Most of the time it just idles with no picking up my driving altho it sometimes goes to a faster idle while I am at a stoplight with no further change in pitch when the light turns green. I have also had it wind up to a unbelivable pitch when I was in a parking lot looking for a space.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is alright- its good to play if you just want to kill a few minutes, but its not something I'd be able to pay attention to for long. It does run well on my Droid 2, and is good for working your reflexes.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|this cable is great for the price if you want to go out there and spend $30 on a hdmi cable because you will get a better quality your wrong. this cable gives excellent picture quality. i used it on my ps3 to my samsung led dlp tv 50\\" and it gives a great picture for my games and blu-ray movies
0312570740|4.0|Finally had a chance to read this book and learn more about the story of Marc Rich. Extremely well researched, many numbers are there to depict both the professional and personal life of the man who \\"invented\\" on spot market for oil and how he made it from nothing to one of the most successful commodity trader ever. An easy and interesting, it give a \\"non-American\\" perspective on the various crimes he was accused with and all the troubles he's been through with the American justice (thus arguably more objective and less media-biased on that particular matter). It's nicely written, Daniel keeps a journalistic tone although at some point he seems over-sympathizing with MR, but he simply tries to present facts and figures for a better understanding of the commodity trading world over the last four decades. Also, the whole polemic around Marc Rich & co takes a very different meaning when it's analyzed from a much larger \\"big picture\\" perspective. Very interesting to think about what happens behind closed doors and the political relations between USA-Iran-Israel, especially when there's a lot of cash on (under) the table. Not sure all data and infos in the book are accurate and some of it should be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Looking at the other negative reviews of this book, I'm avoiding the trap of discrediting the book by using the poor argument \\"glencore is a bad company, so we should ban everything that has ever been in contact with it, and marc rich is a vile person, etc...\\". I simply won't go there, and this review is not about marc rich, his actions, his ethics, his business drive and his morality. This isn't about if he's a good or bad human, but it is about a book that provides more information about his background and the context where he has worked and done business (and with whom).<br /><br />It's not a life-changing book, but it's worth a read - it's inspiring, educative, and hard to stop before your read the whole thing. I wish there was more information there about the whole global trading history and the socio-economic context in which all these deals took place, etc. But hey, in the end the book is about marc rich anyway... right?ere about the whole global trading history and the socio-economic context in which all these deals took place, etc. But hey, in the end the book is about marc rich anyway... right?
B0017APPSE|5.0|love this movie in blue ray!  this is such a great movie, Natalie Portman is wonderful in this one, she is such a great actress and seeing it on blue ray is even better!  I definitely suggest this one!
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I enjoyed the book, its plot, and its characters. I almost didn't get the book because of the negative reviews I had read. I decided to get a sample on the kindle to see if I liked it enough to buy it. I did, and I have read 3 of the following books in the series and I like them as well. Is it a knock your socks off, never forget what you learned here kind of book? I would say no, but I still enjoyed reading it, and I would recommend it to people who like romance and vampires.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I bought this dvd because I already had the second movie...I love these movies and the dvd quality is wonderful!  I recommend these movies for a great time!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Since this is my favorite movie of all time it could only be good, what was especially so was the fact that you got both theatrical & extended version.  Quality was as promised!
B0040JBAMY|5.0|Great album.  Looks like there is a dispute over which \\"greatest hits\\" package to get. For me, this is as good as any.  Perhaps I am a casual fan, but the majority of stuff seems to be here. Plus, I enjoy the live recordings, which I didn't previously have.    I really like how this shows Queen from their ballads to their arena anthems.  Listening to it, it reminded me what seems to be missing from a lot of today's music. This band was made for a live show and that is showcased here nicely.  Thought it was a nice touch that really nailed down this collection as the greatest hits package that works for me.  Plus, there Freddy Mercury things with so much emotion!!  Wow.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|As a huge The Walking Dead comic fan, I was cautiously excited to hear AMC/Frank Darabont were producing this as a television series. Even with AMC's record of producing high quality series & Darabont's previous works, I still worried because adapations almost never meet the calibre of the source material. Thank goodness my worries were for nothing.    The first season compromises of six episodes with the first one strong enough to be released on its own as a standalone movie. Some fans of the comic didn't like some of the changes made to the characters/plot but I think these changes didn't detract from the series at all.     The episodes are well written and boast a strong cast. Viewers who normally shy away from horror/zombie films shouldn't stay away from this. Yes, there is some gore (and of course zombies!) but the story is really about the human relationships in the time of utter devestation. The zombies are merely a prop used to move the story along.

B004PUG7MG|4.0|I've always been a fan of Avril and have enjoyed all of her cds, and goodbye lullaby did not disappoint! i think she has a lot of range in terms of being able to write slow ballads, catchy pop songs, and more rock sounding tracks. I know some of the complaints about the cd is that there are too many ballads, but I think with the topics she was writing about she couldn't really write a bunch of upbeat pop songs. she's been through a lot this year(divorce with derrick from sum 41 and it seems as if music is her way of getting everything off her chest. she is really good at writing catchy songs that you can relate to. In this cd most of the songs are slower songs, but are still fun and don't bore you. my favorite song on the cd is everybody hurts, and i love what the hell, wish you were here, smile, I love you, 4 real, and darlin. the more i listen to it, the more the other songs grow on me as well. she has a lot of talent and in my opinion she just keeps getting better and better!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|On startup, it shows  the splash screen, then  after about a minute, the Droid X soft-reboots.  Not very entertaining. But reliable in its crashes, one supposes.
B004G600A4|5.0|TANGLED is much more than \\"a drop of golden sun.\\" It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.<br /><br />With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.<br /><br />And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.<br /><br />Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.<br /><br />Absolutely a must for any animation fan.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Nothing is more convenient than having your entire library, regardless of GB on your SD card. I got gimped by a small 8 GB class 2 card, now it doesn't even matter! :D
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I've got several bags and cases for my venerable Canon 20D but none of them really worked well for carrying just the body, 17-85mm \\"walkaround\\" zoom and a few accessories. This new Case Logic holster is just the ticket and is now my favorite. There's just enough storage room for an extra battery pack, a couple of filters and some lens cleaning materials and I love the fact that the sewn-in belt loop is really secure for when I want to carry it on my hip. And, while the included shoulder strap lacks a non-slip pad, it is long enough to sling across your body which is a far more secure way to carry your precious camera and lens. If, like me, you want to carry your DSLR and a standard zoom lens and no other lenses, external flash, etc. this is the case for you. Highly recommended.
B004KSQN7C|3.0|Over the past few years, Britney Spears music has actually been pretty good. I was slightly surprised when she came out with Blackout, and Circus. I thought the beats, videos, and image were pretty cutting edge. Even with Lady Gaga and others coming out. I thought she was on the right track to building up a solid reputation as a good dance artist. While this album, isn't great, it seems to lack in some of the rhythmic movements, that I might have been looking for.  Hold it Against Me, was not very good. I will give her credit for adding the dubstep in, that made it one of her most complex songs(electronically) yet. The first half of the album seems to be a repeat of Hold it Against Me, Till the World Ends, and the first half of the album. The album really starts to get good when she comes out with Drop Dead, and the Will I AM track. I think that was a smart choice for her to choose Will I AM(Even though the BEPs weren't as good this year). Gasoline and Criminal were also to stand out tracks as well. I think this will be a sleeper album for Britney Spears.She's not bad,but she's got a certain image as the 90s pop star.And quite frankly some of her music still sounds the same after ten plus years. I would suggest getting this album, because the sleeper tracks are alot stronger then the singles she's choosing. (Which proves shes not that bad). I would also suggest picking up Robbie William's or Kylie Minogue's latest summer releases,there alot stronger(a suggestion from itunes and amazon on my playlists).
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This post Gainax production is maybe the best Anime ever seen (at least on BluRay). The unfortunate events of March 2011 certainly points out the similarity to the end of the world in the Evangelion Universe and real modern life in a apocalypse Japan.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|better than the original. instead of killing pigs you rescue other birds trapped in cages. i have not beat it yet so not sure if there are new birds.  new levels come out each month
0439023513|2.0|The first one was good, the second okay, but the third disappointed me.  I kept putting it down and forcing myself to come back and finish it.  I think it's mainly because the character of Katniss is SO unlikeable.  She is selfish, bratty, and I just want to shake her.  I understand that the author means to convey the traits \\"fierce\\" and \\"independent\\", but she fails to do so as Katniss seems to complain constantly, and be ever-so-ready to betray or hurt someone.   Perhaps the author realized she didn't have to portray Katniss as someone for us to like.  We all love Peeta, and that's what makes us root for Katniss, his survival and well-being depends on her survival.  The end was so depressing.  The whole book was depressing.  ***SPOILERS below, questions I have?    Why was it not elaborated at the trial that Coin had used her as a pawn, and therefore let off for something else, but not because she was \\"insane\\"?  Why was Prim in the Capitol?  I thought she was working in the hospital to care for the injured. How could Gale give up so easily? Not even a visit, nor an explanation to Katniss? (And for us readers?)
B002RKRTGO|2.0|I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville.  If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have used a lot of music apps out there, and while i might miss their more advanced features, this one delivers an entire music ecosystem!  I love It!
B004QPOVE6|5.0|I can't believe that this dvd is coming out. The best part is that I was at that show in ARGENTINA. It was an awsome concert, besides the show I bet that the shots a the beautifull argentinian women will make this dvd an all around event. Can't wait to get it on the mail.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|UPDATE - ATTENTION EVO 4G USERS:  It turns out (after much online research today) that the issues I was experiencing were unique to the HTC Evo 4G, and were the result of a software update that had been pushed out to Evo users earlier this year.  Apparently this update had changed HTTP and RTSP streaming settings/configuration in a way that affected certain apps--in this case it rendered the Amazon cloud player completely useless.      Interestingly, Pandora was somehow never affected by it, and so I hadn't noticed the problem until now.  Go figure.    Anyway, the issue can easily be resolved by contacting Sprint Technical Support (1-888-211-4727) and asking the rep to apply the work around listed as 'HTC EVO 4G (A9292) - UPDATED 2-1-2011: Streaming multimedia applications receiving errors on software version 3.70.651.1' in Sprint's device portal.  I did this, and when I finally got to a tech support rep, he immediately knew what I was talking about, pushed an over-the-air fix, and 5 minutes later I was streaming from the Amazon mp3 cloud (over 3G) without any issues at all.       It works perfectly now.  Sweet.  I'm upgrading my rating from 1 star (when I really meant 0) to 3 stars.    ---- previous review -----:    This review is specific to the new \\"cloud player\\" functionality of the app.  Two words:  utterly useless.  I would honestly give it 0 stars if I could.    I'm on an HTC Evo (Android 2.2).  Regardless of my connection--WiFi, 4G, 3G--I continually get the same \\"Network Error\\" when trying to play anything at all in the app.  It just doesn't work.  All other network-dependent apps on my device are working perfectly fine, while the Amazon MP3 player fails.    I wouldn't even consider this alpha-quality software.  Did this thing even go through QA at all?

B0006A9FKA|4.0|I thought this movie was extremely funny and a great tribute to the original Romero \\"undead\\" movies.  The actors were hilarious.  I especially liked that the premise was not copied from Romero's films (with the exception of the resurrection of the dead.)   It was a love story that just happened to be during a zombie plague.  The character, Ed, was so laid back.  To him, it was as if the zombie phenomena happened every day. I liked the \\"what happened when...\\" during the plot holes part of the DVD.  This is a great movie to have a scary laugh.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I honestly tried to love this novel, but I couldn't even like it enough to finish it.  The style of writing is a little more strained than I care for, and perhaps that's the translation's fault, not the original author's fault.
0425169251|5.0|Dame Agatha Christie (1890-1976) the Devon Diva of Crime was at the apogee of her long authorial career in the 1940s. One Two Buckle My Shoe (aka in America as \\"The Patriotic Murders\\") provides readers with a fine novel of murder and detection by Hercule Poirot the little Belgian detective with an egg shaped face and a brain of genius!<br />  The Plot: We find the novel beginning in a dentist office at 58 Charlotte Street in London. Poirot visits the dentist every six months for a routine checkup. Unfortuantely the dentist is a murder victim! Dr. Henry Morley! The police believe it was a suicide case but Poirot will prove the good man suffered a murder most foul! Morley's assistant Gladys had been called away to visit with a supposedly ill aunt; the real reason was to get her out of the office. Mr. Amberiotis a patient of Morley is also found murdered. Another patient named Mabelle Sainsbury Seale is discovered missing; later her body wearing shabby shoes is found in a trunk. Howard Raikes the lover of Jane Olivera (niece and heir of Anthony Blunt) and Frank Carter a young man with a bad reputation come under scrutiny for the crime. It is thought the object of the murderer was the killing of Alistair Blunt a rich banker who is influential in the British government.<br />  The way in which the murderer is discovered shows Poirot's little grey cells are still worthy of praise despite his growing age. The book moves rapidly and keeps your attention throughout the proceedings. This is one of Dame Agatha Christie's best Poirot novels. Enjoy1
B0032CVAQQ|1.0|I only read this book at the insistance of my best friends.  I can't believe I read the same book they did, because I wanted to bleach my brain from the drivel this guy was selling.  How it took that many pages to describe the '5 Languages' I'll never know.  Of course this guy has to keep selling how excellent he is with stories of couples that gushed on and on about him, and without that, this book would have only been 5 chapters too long instead of 10.<br /><br />If need your partner to make you feel loved/wanted, then tell them how.  That's what this book ultimately says.  I'm not sure why anyone needs a book to tell them that.
B0038W0OIK|5.0|This is an overall fantastic product. The comfort is one of a kind and the sound quality is amazing. I am a professional gamer and I have attended events all around the world with really loud sounds. Whenever I had any headset that was not noise canceling, I would struggle to hear any sort of in game sounds. These mishaps can cost thousands of dollars. The 7H was an instant relief because now I have no issues hearing anything going on in game with these headsets. The best part is the fact you can not only break down the headset for easy packing, but you can remove the ear cup that has the leather (noise canceling) and plug in the cloth that was used in previous headsets to allow you to hear outside noise when you are at home for example. The noise canceling is so good that sometimes when playing at home I cant hear anything at all and its something for a common user of this product you may want to be able to hear a baby or the door bell. I strongly recommend this product for the availability to change that and the quality of sound that comes out of the headset. It is perfect for airplanes and for any regular use just like any other headset could, except this one has fantastic sound quality and the availability to change the ear cups.
B0000060LT|2.0|It really is quite nice listening if you're sad or doing something else, but I feel misled by Amazon's review, which suggested that it \\"bristle[s] with electricity,\\" and that \\"underneath there is a rock band--a dangerous, fire-breathing bunch with lust in their hearts and murder in their eyes.\\"  I heard none of this.

1440503257|1.0|If you're 12 years old or under, this might be a book for you. But I'm someone who likes the idea of a concept cookbook (such as the excellent \\"Lobscouse and Spotted Dog,\\" a companion to the Aubrey-Maturin novels.) This is not that kind of book. It's condescending in tone, and rooted in an assumption that Americans are culinary nitwits. As another reviewer mentioned, these dishes have little to do with Harry Potter, and most would be found in any traditional British cookbook. It includes several that are footnoted to say \\"this recipe has not been tested,\\" proceed at your own risk. And there's also a recipe for Blood Pudding, with the helpful aside that you won't be able to make it, because you can't legally buy animal blood in the US. What you've got here is a clever idea for cashing in on the Harry Potter craze. No wonder it's Unofficial.

B002ZG98UK|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Resident Evil video game series, I've played every Playstation iteration of it and loved them all. When they made the first RE movie I thought for sure it would be just as horrible as every other game-based movie, but much to my surprise I really enjoyed it and have also enjoyed the sequels. Sure the movies are campy, but that's a large part of their charm in my opinion. We recently purchased a 3D capable Sony Bravia and this was the first movie I popped into it to check the 3D capabilities. Wow! WOW!!!! WOOOOOOW!!!! I was blown away from the very first scene just like I was when I saw it in the theater. This movie isn't just a 3D-ized version of RE, it was clearly made to be 3D from the ground up. Every scene makes jaw-dropping use of the technology, I just can't say enough good things about what they've accomplished in this movie. All the viewing planes are fully utilized- the scenes have an amazing amount of depth and there is enough usage of pop-out elements to keep things interesting without seeming carnival-like. Some of the landscape scenes would be right at home in a National Geographic 3D episode. This is the movie to get out when you want to show your friends what 3D is all about! I won't review the movie storyline itself since that's been done sufficiently by others here, I'll just say that I personally loved it although I can see how it might not appeal to everyone, especially those unfamiliar with the RE games or those who don't care for zombie movies in general. But whether or not you like the content, the dazzling use of 3D is sure to impress nearly anyone. Here's hoping that Hollywood catches on and brings us more eye-candy like this rather than trying to force 3D onto a movie like they did with the Last Airbender disaster.

Then my friend made me watch the first 2 episodes and loaned me the rest of Season 1 and I got hooked. Season 2 is even better and everything has intensified. I love how the show keeps you guessing with all the twists it adds on. Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian) has the brotherly love/hate and rivalry/teamwork relationship. I can't wait for season 3! I haven't seen all of season 2 yet but I hope Elena stays with Stefan.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|This movie was action packed, mysterious, and exciting!  It had me guessing what her next move was, unlike a lot of films where I know whats coming.  I appreciate that in a movie.  I love A.J. in any movie because she is an excellent actress but this movie really proved she pushes the limit. This movie was originally written with a mans character, not a woman named Evelyn Salt.  When Tom Cruise turned down the movie (thank GOD) because he has done too many of these types, they wanted another star who could command the screen as well as he. I believed they picked the perfect person for this film and wrote it very well.  GREAT MOVIE.
B004NSULHM|5.0|When a couple of months ago Tom Yorke posted on his facebook wall the fact that he liked the music of CAN (Future Days is my personal favorite one) not only has he given us a hint as to the direction of the focus of Radiohead's new arrangements, but perhaps he also meant to ask us to look at the length of their new album from a perspective. And we should because The King Of Limbs listening experience is not about the length of duration but it's all about the depth of expression. Radiohead's new music and lyrics keep on growing within us in many hidden ways.<br /><br />So now that one of the most and longest awaited albums is here, what can be said about it? The melodic beauty becomes less important and the repetitive layers from the background of Radiohead's past and from the final minute of many songs of In Rainbows come forth and take over the center stage. The atmosphere of The King Of Limbs should not surprise anyone because it sounds like a natural progression of the music of In Rainbows and The Eraser, Thom Yorke's amazing solo album (make sure to listen to And It Rained All Night and Harrowdown Hill for a while, if you are not hooked on them yet). Lyrically, I would dare to state that we have received a concept album from Thom Yorke. Not that he had been beating around the bushes in the past but this time 'the artist, the judged' reveals the depths of his own being to us in quite overwhelming and fully committed way. He points us (man upon a stick) into the direction of a poem called Sailing To Byzantium by William Butler Yeats who is proposing the idea of oneness connecting the immortality of human spirit and art. So what is the conceptual statement of Thom Yorke's latest creation? One liners are out of the question but here is what I read between his words (coming from Thom's mind):<br /><br />Sometimes you need to breathe deeply to let the tsunami waves of the spiritual ocean in and out of you. I see your spirit behind your eyes, but unfortunately we are as rare among humans as magpies among animals in being able to perceive and to recognize our own true selves. God knows I am. And little by little we both know that you know, but are we true suckers for all things spiritual or just real posers? We, flowers of lotus, the symbol of the sun, of creation and rebirth; why do we shine with exterior motives, which only bring us emptiness and fool us by our own blown egos? Let us withdraw and leave most of our stimuli behind us and focus on what is inside and real. But wait... i can't really feel you anymore... stripped by the tsunami waves of the spiritual ocean.<br /><br />Bloom spreads its wings all around us and what a song it is. Listening to it feels to me like I could be standing in my own hallway hearing Rapoon's Recurring Dream Circle or Kirghiz Light playing in my room and the sounds of one of Radiohead's ballads coming out of my wife's room (she constantly listens to them). I can almost bet that Thom shares my love of repetitive experimental sound. That happens to be a dangerous addictive territory in which your brain, when hooked, starts repelling melodies. Bloom ((next to Lotus Flower) is probably the most complex sound texture of The King Of Limbs. It is eerie, powerful and intoxicating. Those years are over but I can only imagine the depth of trips this song could induce if taken with substances. This is ambient, experimental. industrial, folk and choir music coming to us all together. An amazing achievement.<br /><br />Morning Mr Magpie is another extreme grower. It has the most in common with The Eraser, but its layers are more complex and developed. First time I listened to this album I completely skipped over this one, and now I can see that I start liking it more and more, little by little, but that's the title of the next song.<br /><br />If a band without any financial needs places eight songs on an album following their earlier release by almost four years, and on top of it they happen to be Radioheadwith their incredibly creative and ground breaking achievement of portfolio, I will listen closely to their every song. Little By Little might have been the one alluding me the longest, and I am beginning to wonder if perhaps this one is by crook, Thom is such a tease and we are such a flirt...<br /><br />Feral sounds like a drum beat applied over textures of one of the better :Zoviet France: albums (What Is Not True; Look Into Me; Just An Illusion; Shadow The Thief Of Sun; Mort Aux Vaches Feedback; and Shouting At The Ground are my personal favorites). The later part has this ZF feel to it and it creates quite an atmospheric background to very rare drum solo.<br /><br />Lotus Flower is the most powerful and intense song of this album, because of its unique contradictory expression. It is lyrically the darkest, most complex and revealing but melodically it is a nice simple cheerful song, and with such easy going happy-go-lucky voice Thom delivers the song's gloomy content. The simple melody of Lotus Flower comes with all toppings needed to fit this album. What an amazing final cut and how much it adds to this album. The layers here are spectacular: random hands clapping, dissonant textures, the sound of small rocks shaking, delay and echo effect, voice harmony sampled and distorted beyond recognition, fractured rhythm coming and going in and out of focus, the constant movement of the focus itself, and (if that was not enough) a synthesizer sound imitating the sound of some baby animal evoking our emotional reaction. Seriously, as in Bloom, we have to acknowledge the magnitude of this texture. There is some similarity to Jigsaw Falling Into Place in terms of melody line, tempo and energy but a lot of music has been replaced by a wall of looping sound full of distortion and vibration. We realize that we no longer listen to Radiohead only with our ears, but it feels like we are breathing this texture in and our nervous system certainly participates in our listening experience to a much greater degree as well.<br /><br />Codex is today my favorite song of this amazing album (tomorrow it could be Bloom, Lotus Flower, or Give Up The Ghost). It has this minimalist Videotape feel to it. The introduction, the ambient layer, the distortion, and the gradual growth are all so hauntingly atmospheric, like a journey to the center of beauty. Someone is trying to dissect beauty into its smallest, gentlest aspects and is successful in reaching into the center of my soul.<br /><br />Give Up The Ghost is as much about the music as it is about the space the music plays in. Could Thom be sharing his next focus with us? It is possible and probable that our next Radiohead experience will have even more to do with the relation between their music and the silence it breaks, and Give Up The Ghost could be giving us a clue... How do we sound to a... fly?<br /><br />The steady and unsophisticated drum beat of Separator begins this song which strength lies in its looped echoing later part bouncing off this constant beat. The textures of sound come in and out of focus as well, the voice, guitar parts, vocal harmony, beat again; we are being surrounded by constant change, and we are also given a buffer before... we come away from our latest Radiohead experience worried that we might have lost our dear Thom Yorke for good now, and that he is not interested in our exterior world anymore. This song separates us from the spiritual world of this phenomenal creation.<br /><br />Not every Radiohead fan will llke this album but we should all remember that trying to evaluate this music and lyrics upon listening to these songs a couple of times is simply silly. This is not an album you fall in love with in your heart. You expose your subconscious levels to this music and given time it will make you attuned to its delicate vibrations. I have been listening to this album for over a month now, but I can't just be randomly listening to it (and it happens to be the worstskiing music). It is simply too intense of an experience to experience it fully. It takes much longer to get there. For me that means loud quality sound all around me, on repeat, over and over again for at least a few hours...

B000NA2BEU|5.0|My sister introduced me to the Veronica Mars series since I didn't see it when it was still running on television.  I was skeptical at first (another high school soap opera?) but was quickly hooked!  Kristen Bell and the supporting staff are fantastic, the characters are interesting and engaging, the storylines are very nicely plotted, and there are enough \\"twists and turns\\" to keep you guessing!  I'm only disappointed that there were only three seasons!  I have all three seasons and have enjoyed rewatching them when I can't find anything worthwhile on network television . . . which is often.  You can't go wrong with this series if you like a good drama with an excellent cast of actors and actresses.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Great movie about the difficulty of being a stutterer. Being a stutterer could be the hardest thing one could face in his entire life. That is because we humans naturally need to communicate with one another, and talking is a basic communication method that is used on a daily basis. Now when your basic need for communication becomes your worst fear due to you being a stutterer, you become your own worst enemy.     This movie highlighted some of the common conclusions and theories about the causes and treatment of stuttering:    - You are not born a stutterer, something caused it  - When you speak to yourself, you don't stutter  - When you can't hear your voice, you don't stutter  - Taking a deep breath before speaking makes speaking easier  - You don't stutter when you sing (and thus speak with a melodic accent to help avoid stuttering)  - Most parents do not know how to fix their child's stuttering problem. They usually unknowingly make it worse  - When you get a hesitation while speaking, turn it into a pause then continue  - If pronouncing a letter is difficult, skip over it (e.g. if pronouncing \\"P\\" is difficult, put an \\"A\\" before the \\"P\\" and say the word)  - Frequent pauses makes speaking much easier    I always thought that planning the speech or thinking about the pronunciation of the word before saying it is what causes you to stutter. I always thought that speaking happens naturally without thinking and if you start thinking about speaking, you lose control and that's because putting the letters together to form words and sentences is very complicated that has to be done spontaneously.    Great Movie!     Oscar Award is well deserved!!

B0000E6XH3|5.0|I just purchased Interstella 5555 and I absolutely love it!  I bought Daft Punk's Discovery album when it first came out.  When I listen to the music while watching the Interstella storyline unfold, it puts a new spin on it.  I really fell for the characters and I absolutely love the final scene at the end.  Great masterpiece!
0385523912|5.0|What I will long remember the love story of Mi-ran and Jun-sang--two ordinary North Koreans who fall in love as teenagers and spend years walking the dark streets of their home town, sharing their hearts with each other, and who both manage to defect, only to end up separated by circumstances. The details of their story, how dark the city is, how important tiny matters of family background are in the \\"egalitarian\\" society of North Korea (which in reality, has a political caste system), the way a warm-hearted young woman learns to look away when her kindergarten students are starving literally to death--these make more of an impression than any statistics.<br /><br />What I also appreciated about this story is that she acknowledges the difficulty of North Koreans after they leave the North, including their own personal difficulties and the fact that they have survivor's guilt and may have been \\"misfits\\" throughout their lives. It would be easy to sanitize their stories, to make them into heroes. But the fact that Mi-ran adapted quickly to South Korea and seemed to have a happy life there--only to learn that her two sisters were sent to labor camps as a result of her defection--is devastating to read.<br /><br />The one point that I wondered about as I read was how much Korean the author speaks, and how these interviews were conducted. There is a tiny mention of an interpreter, and if each story had to be filtered through both an interpreter and a Western journalist, we may be sure that something is lost (or added) along the way. But what alternative is there for an American to get a feel for North Korean lives?<br /><br />It is also instructive to consider the reasons that re-union of North and South Korea can only be deeply problematic. Both China and South Korea, while favoring the end of the Kim regime, also have deep reasons to fear a collapse of the North. The tragedy of North Korea has no easy answers, and even those who escape its clutches find no easy road.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Within Temptation is one of those bands, with every album created you don't know how it's possible they could get any better, and yet they surprise you. This is definitely my favorite CD of theirs up to date.     For this album, Within Temptation decided to base the songs around a comic, which they created. Pretty similar to what Coheed and Cambria did (although Within Temptation's is in my opinion a thousand times better). The basis of the story (as far as I have discovered), begins with an elderly woman, known to us as \\"Mother Maiden\\". She has been blessed with the supernatural gift of overcoming death. As a result, she is immortal. She's also set in using her gift to make a difference for good in the world. Who does she bring back to life? Not the righteous, who have lived good, noble lives, and have merited eternal happiness. Not the wicked, who are damned, and very deserving of their fate. She brings back those who were good deep down in their heart, but who did something awful for which they need redemption. And she leads them to bring down justice upon the wicked.     The main character is named Sinead Harkin. She was murdered in 1967, for protecting a friend of her's (who's name is Opal), from her abusive husband. Mother Maiden finds her in the morgue, and brings her back from the grave, so she can atone for a grievous sin she committed only  year earlier. It was back then, she was a drug addict. Her daughter had been taken from her custody, and placed in the care of her father. She broke in to her father's home, to steal enough to buy another hit. It's also apparent she wanted to see her daughter. Her father walks in on her. He tells her she needs to get help, get her life in order, and finally be a mother to her daughter. She says she can't, that she needs the money (obviously not in her right mind), and ends up pulling a gun and shooting him. She never does get convicted, but she bares the guilt of her father's murder pretty deeply over the next year. Mother Maiden gives her the opportunity to find penance.    Another character we are introduced to is named \\"Triplets\\". His father was a war hero. Fought in three wars, saved a lot of people. And like most war heroes, the wars he fought him really messed him up. He would drink all the time, and in his drunkenness, he would abuse his son. It leads his son to develop a three-way split personality disorder. There's a good side, a darker side, and the soul struggling in between. The darker side of him convinces him that something has to be done. The boy reluctantly agrees. He steals one of his dad's old grenades, and when his dad comes into his room late at night, he blows the both of them up. Once again, patricide. It's one of the most terrible sins, yet it was committed by someone not inherently wicked. Mother Maiden finds him, and brings him back to life. Only this time, all three personalities are given separate entities. So there are now three of them, bent on righting the wrongs of the world.    The story also follows two detectives, who are sent to investigate a string of strange murders in the area. There is also a priest (of which we do not know many of the details), who we witness performing a satanic ritual, in order to strike a deal with the devil, probably to summon him or one of his angels.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM. The CD would be incredible on it's own, but I feel purchasing the DVD and comic is a MUST.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Ok I have read a book about the story of facebook before watching this movie, I still enjoyed watching this movie to a great extent.    This movie is a collection of a couple of lawsuits made against Mark Zuckerberg. The scenes of the lawsuits take us to flashbacks of the life of Mark where facebook started and its initial establishment steps that led to these lawsuits.     The story of Mark Zukerberg is the story of success. Once you are successful and you start having the cake, others will want to share it with you, even take it away from you!    Good movie, but I didn't feel it was worthy of being an Oscar Award nominee. I dunno this is just my opinion.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|The definite album of 2011 is here. Femme Fatale, Britney's best work to date, includes the number-one hit ''Hold It Against Me'', the amazing ''Till The World Ends'' and the highly anticipated ''Criminal''.     Teamed up with the best producers in the industry, Spears gives us an incredible and amazing album.     Pure Pop Music. Pure energy. Pure Britney Spears music.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. One of my favorites of the year and every time I watch it I am amazed at how cussing great it is.
1878424505|2.0|At the risk of sounding trite and petty, I don't believe this book is worth reading.  I had high expectations due to so many great review however I failed to see the profound value in reading it.  Principles are basic and wordy.  Metaphors and references are superficial and overly simplistic.  Book was an easy read, and brought some concepts to mind but book was not worth buying.
B004NSULHM|5.0|All I have to say is it sounds like a Radiohead album. At first your not sure what to think, and then after a short period, any doubts you may have had disappear and you realize that once again you love the entire album. Doesn't matter if the song is slow or fast, you know its a Radiohead song. I don't care if it sounds like one of their other albums, I'm just glad they keep creating new ones.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Great movie with beautiful color and great music. Children love the story. Dragon is intense for little ones. No waiting for it to come out of the Vault!!!
B000YABYLA|5.0|This is such a fun movie! It's a funny take on a serious issue. I thought the actors were all excellent and i will definitely watch this again and again!
B004L49K20|5.0|I have always found something to like in every DD record but can freely admit that I can listen to every record from beginning to end without reaching for the track forward button from time to time.  I believe Seven and the Ragged Tiger was their first make or break moment and they somehow went safe but sideways.  Not horrible but it was a step back from Rio even though they were wildly popular as they rode The Reflex, New Moon on Monday and Union of the Snake while touring huge arenas around the world.  Notorious and Big Thing were great records and very brave for the time.  Liberty came out and while I found much to like, that record helped to escort them into a perceived obscurity.  The Wedding Album once again showed the world that they still were great songwriters and musicians and while Thank You got ripped by the press, I found much to like and felt they treated the songs with only the care that true fans of music could accomplish.  Medazzaland and Pop Trash had some great songs on them but didn't repair the damage that Thank You did to their overall perception in popular culture.  The reunion had mixed results, as did Massacre but again, I found more than a few good songs on those records.    All You Need Is Now signals their arrival as the band most of us knew they could be and hopefully an introduction to new generations of fans who will have discovered a great band.  There is not even just an average song on this record as all of them are fantastic.  Very few records are void of a bad or mediocre song, many of the records that live on the \\"greatest of all time\\" lists can make that statement but somehow this band that has been ripped by the media managed to pull off a feat that the large majority of musicians will never do.    From start to finish, this is a collection of terrific pop songs that showcase great songwriting, great musicianship, great singing and great collaboration with a talented producer.  There are some incredible melodies and smart chordchanges that are key ingredients to great songs, each song sounding different but from the same place.  A place where musicians have all the pieces fall together and enjoy themselves on a record.  I can't recommend this record enough to anyone wanting a great listening experience.  OK Computer, Definitely Maybe, Achtung Baby, The Suburbs, Morning Glory, Stay Calm and Carry On and X&Y are some great records I was lucky enough to find in the past decades that I can always turn to and I just added another.
B002NV9AH8|2.0|Flat and uninteresting.  Music for house plants.  Has the Genesis sound without any of the wit and musical hooks that made Genesis of that era so interesting to listen to.  I can see why his solo musical career went nowhere.
B004ETVAH0|3.0|There is no doubt that Jeff Beck is on this album. His name is plastered on the cover so one would expect a very prominent Jeff guitar but his role is often subordinated to the singers, other players and the music itself. There are several \\"Jeff moments\\" of fine soloing but for the most part, this is a celebration CD for Les Paul. So if you can accept the fact that you're buying a Jeff Beck album with little signature Jeff music, then you'll be very happy. Obviously, I was expecting something very different. I own every Jeff commercial release and a shelf full of his bootlegs as well and generally, have loved just about everything (except for Flash). So I fully understand that he's a performing chameleon. My main point of all this is that he was a role player on this CD (and just about any other guitarist would have done just as well) and I felt a bit cheated. This was advertised as \\"Jeff Beck - Rock n' Roll Party\\" when it should have been advertised as \\"Rock 'n Roll Party with an All-Star cast\\". I simply felt mislead, that's all.
B003NQB552|5.0|I can't even remember how I found this one...it may have been one of those cases that the \\"if you like this, you will like this\\" thing paid off.  It's a strong album all around, \\"Little Queen\\" and \\"Soul on Fire\\" grabbed me immediately, but slow or fast, they are all great.  The Grace Potter comparison is definitely there in the upbeat songs, but the band has a variety of other sounds to it, too.  I can only hope they will make it over here sometime for live shows!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I love this album, highly recommended. The main singer's got a rich voice and the music is like a dark fairy tale mixed with a good drumbeat.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Very engaging film about a very engaging human being.  So well played by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.  Mandela was a remarkable human being whose character attributes, humility and wisdom are clearly demonstrated in this film.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|Unforgiven is not just the best western I have ever seen but may very well be one of the greatest American films of all time. Right up there with such classics as Citizen Kane and Casablanca. I owned the original release on DVD ( though not the speciel edition ) and it looked terrible on my new 55 inch HDTV even with the upconversion that comes with a Blu Ray player. So I purchased the bluray edition. WOW! The film looks great in 1080p. The colors are sharp and vibrant and the black levels are good. If you don't own this film get it.
B00133KHCY|5.0|One of the best movies out there.  There are cheesy moments but the heart of it is pure and simple.  Brilliant.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Great for buying music and cloud is a great idea..but..needs way to upload from phone, needs lockscreen widget with art, needs a way to shuffle all music on local device, and I could keep going. Still not terrible for first player

159420229X|5.0|I just finished this book and loved it! The thing that makes is great is that the book is much more than just the author training for a memory competition. You get to learn about the place our memory has played throughout humanities evolution. The writing style was very enjoyable, and I finished this book in about 3 sitting it was so good!
0756404738|5.0|A worthy continuation to an outstanding story. If you enjoyed Name of the Wind, you're likely to enjoy Wise Man's Fear. The only thing that I think detracts from the book is the inclusion of so many stories. Not plot lines, mind you, but stories within the story.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Works fine for me on the Incredible, but the Feint online section doesn't load scores. Ok game, not great, not awful. Glad I got it for free. (Perfectionist Achievement doesn't work.)
075640407X|5.0|I read The Name of the Wind in 2008. By that time enough people had read it that it had gained a bit of buzz. I've read Jordan, Martin, Goodkind, Brooks, Sanderson, etc. The Name of the Wind meets or surpasses all of them. Rothfuss labors over his novels and it shows. Every word needs to be there for the benefit of the story.
B004L49K20|5.0|`All You Need Is Now' is a unique album... the 13th studio album released by Duran Duran, with the 9 tracks from the  digital album, 5 additional tracks, a bonus track exclusive to the CD... `Networker Nation' and a bonus DVD. It has  the feel of what the band had done and still sound new.  `Safe' (In The Heat Of The Moment) is a great dance club   track.  Very entertaining.  I'm looking forward to the remixes.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I love this album...It is all I have listened to since the day it was released...Adele is amazing, her voice is beautiful and this album is just truly genious...All of the songs are so easy to listen too...It has been a very long time since there has been an album out that is just clean, good, true music...I believe she wrote all or most of her songs which makes me appreciate her music that much more...I sure hope she wins a Grammy for this album, she certainly deserves it...
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|As a person who has always been interested in aviation and in the Vietnam War, I was very happy to come across this book.  I could go on and describe the book in detail, but let me just simply say that have read it 3 times and will most likely pick up again soon.  It is very well written and the author shares some great stories of his missions in Vietnam.  I am repeatedly amazed at what those pilots did with those machines and how they put the lives of others ahead of their own time and time again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys aviation, Vietnam, or simply a well written book.

B004L49K2A|4.0|So sings Simon LeBon on Duran Duran's 13th album. \\"All You Need is Now\\" is a Durannie's dream come true, in that the band dumped the tinny mechanized autotuned mess that marred \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" and found their way back to New Romantic bliss. The squiggly synth that makes the hook of the title track is pure \\"Seven and The Ragged Tiger\\" seduction, and \\"Mediterranea\\" is the sort of mysterious enigmatic ballad that the band specialized in their heyday.<br /><br />Back to the original foursome of LeBon, Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Roger Taylor (with guitarist Dom Brown filling the space of departerd Andy Taylor), Duran Duran now have delivered the logical follow-up to their \\"Astronaut\\" comeback. \\"All You Need is Now\\" is filled with sugary pop ala \\"Rio\\" and the straightforward production from Mark Ronson. It was my opinion that the over-rated Timbaland squeezed all the life from RCM and turned it into just another pop album dominated by beats instead of songs. Ronson, as a more song oriented producer, let DD be themselves and the album reflects that. LeBon sounds strong as ever, and Rhodes' atmospheric synths float the album above the generic.<br /><br />As one of the few 80's MTV bands to survive with most of the lineup intact and still make relevant music, Duran Duran have proven themselves as a surprisingly enduring, strong creative force. \\"All You Need Is Now\\" indicates that they have the power to make music now and for the future.
1587990717|1.0|I wish I could have my time back. At the very least, I am irritated enough to write a review. As an Engineer and a MBA, I find it amusing nothing of which he wrote was new or revealing and had discussed in great detail during the above programs. The writing was poor at best. Perhaps my favorite part was when he degrades people who use large words to hide their lack of a point and then uses domical instead of home in the next sentence.  Complex words SHOULD be used when it makes for clearer language or more succinctly makes a point, however nothing is added in the example above.  His thoughts are incoherent and he constantly promises to more deeply explore a subject touched on, and yet never delivers.  For example, several times he mentions Warren Buffet and promises an analyst of his career, but fails to return to the subject.  Finally, his politically fueled, petty wars with conservative stalwarts and his fawning over liberals were stomach turning. I feel slightly less intelligent for reading this book. Don't waste your time.

B001U7FWM8|5.0|This is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums. Taken as a complete work, this is the best thing I have heard since Radiohead's Kid A. That's not to say it sounds anything like Kid A, it just flows together and works wonderfully as a complete album. I liked the songs I had heard before individually, but hearing them all together for the first time was incredible. There is not an awkward or out of place moment on the whole thing. The music is beautiful, melodic, otherworldly, haunting, perfectly crafted and yet also unexpected. If you don't like it the first time, I think you should listen to it more. It grows on you. I don't feel the need to point to individual songs like I sometimes do - they're all amazing. But my favorite song is also the last; \\"Foreground\\" is absolutely beautiful and ends the album on a strong note.
0525421580|4.0|This is going to be a difficult review to write! I've waited a couple days to think about the book, and I still can't come to a definite conclusion on where I want my review to go.<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson was definitely a book that is unique and memorable. The different points of view is found in many other books, but the characters are truly the driving force of the novel. However, I felt like the Will Graysons were outshined by the one and only Tiny Cooper. The story seemed to be about him much more than about the Wills, and that was one aspect that I didn't enjoy.<br /><br />I know one thing for sure: I enjoyed this novel. I give it 4/5 stars for a reason. I'm just having a hard time putting that reason into words. The characters were wonderful, and despite the fact that Tiny Cooper ran the show I still found myself falling in love with the Wills and some other minor characters. This book was also terribly addicting. It was one of those books where I read past my planned stopping point just because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />There is definitely a lesson to be learned from reading this book. Perhaps the reason my feelings are so conflicted is because it's a lesson that I am still learning for myself. This book is all about the importance of love (and not even romantic love at that), appreciation, and acceptance. It's a story about inner struggles. And so perhaps those of us who are fighting inner battles, such as myself, can really appreciate this book without understanding why. And maybe in a couple years I can go back and really comprehend the message. For now, I am not going to analyze it too much. This book, for me, was an interesting look at two (three?) teenagers who are on a journey to find a part of them that's missing.
B0019O0VZA|4.0|Hiromi Uehara is my new favorite jazz keyboardist/pianist, a spot held by Chick Corea for 26 or so years in my heart. She's JUST AMAZING! not only the fastest piano playing I've ever heard, bar none, but she's got SUCH amazing feel and songwriting, she's just unbelievable (you must check out her earlier works: Brain and Spiral). Her bass player and drummer and fantastic, as always. I didn't much care for the goobley goo sound of whoever that is on the fretless electric guitar. Sounds too cartooney for me compared the tightness and precision that pervades ALL of her other stuff. (hence a 4 not 5 stars) But hey, it's jazz. You're allowed to experiment. (I'm a HUGE fan of people like Allan Holdsworth and Yngwie Malsteen, so slop on a guitar is not something I can really listen to for long, LOL.. sorry) I highly recommend not only \\"Time Control\\" but all of the albums of Hiromi, I think she is utterly fantastic!
0545123283|5.0|This sequel to the wonderful novel Shiver definitely did not disappoint.<br /><br />My favorite part about Linger was that it answered most of the burning questions that we were left with at the end of Shiver. I had questions about the wolves and about Sam and Grace's relationship, and it answered those questions as well as introducing new conflicts and ideas.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the incorporation of new characters into the story. While it bothers me that there were two entirely new narrators, I was also pleased because I think that's how it should have been in the first place. There were a few places that I got confused with who was talking, but overall Maggie Stiefvater did a good job alternating points of view.<br /><br />Like Shiver, Linger was a book that leaves the reader wanting more. I can't get enough of this series. I love the characters, all of which have such unique and interesting stories and ideas, and I love the writing. These books have a way of painting wonderful pictures in my head, and I can't wait to see what Stiefvater comes up with next.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these books to anybody who could go for a good love story, or even a good werewolf story.
030745455X|5.0|This book was significantly better than it's predecessor for two very important reasons:<br /><br />1. It didn't take too long to get into. The one thing that really irks me about some of the books that I read is drawn out and boring introductions. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo had an introduction that for me was nothing but dull and lengthy. The Girl Who Played With Fire did not have that. The prologue set up the readers for an exciting and intriguing novel, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />2. Dragon Tattoo focused a lot on characters that are not the main characters. While Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander were quite obviously the main characters, much of the story focused on the Vanger family and their history. That bothered me with the first book, because I didn't get as much of a grasp on who the main characters were.<br /><br />That being said, Dragon Tattoo was good. But The Girl Who Played With Fire completely blew me away. I wasn't even planning on reading it, until I was put into a situation where I didn't have a book to read and I was stuck at work for two hours with nothing to do. I bought this book on a whim: I figured, it's cheap and I don't have to try and get into a whole new story.<br /><br />I am SO GLAD that I decided to read it. TGWPWF is such an improvement on Dragon Tattoo. With Dragon Tattoo I felt like it was far too out of my comfort zone to really enjoy. Fire just got me sucked into the story and I couldn't put it down. The story focused on Lisbeth Salander, rather than on an outsider, which I loved. I also loved how fast-paced everything was. While the beginning started out somewhat slow (although not as slow as Dragon Tattoo) once the conflict was introduced I found myself obsessed with finding out what was going to happen.<br /><br />This book was a real thrill ride. The only downside is the abrupt ending. While some aspects of the story were concluded, the reader was left with a lot of unanswered questions, including the unanswered question that was brought up at the ending of the last book.<br /><br />Despite the very few downsides, I would definitely recommend this sequel. I would especially recommend it to those who, like me, were a bit skeptical about the first book. This book didn't disappoint, and while it might take me awhile to get to the third and final installment, I will most definitely be reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.he ending of the last book.

0545123275|4.0|I finished Shiver late on Saturday night, and I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.<br /><br />This book mixes romance and the supernatural with a not-so unique twist: two lovers who can never be with each other. It was almost too sweet how amazing Sam and Grace's relationship was. They were passionate and fun, and they had a connection that was almost unimaginable.<br /><br />The supernatural part is that Sam is a werewolf, and Grace is not.<br /><br />Shiver was filled with suspense, and events that keep the reader wanting more. It's a real page-turner, and despite my problem with a few implausible events, I couldn't help but keep reading. I had to know what happened, and the ending kept me wanting even more- immediately!<br /><br />However, I did have a minor problem with this book: it seemed unrealistic. I know that any book that involves werewolves is unrealistic, but I felt like it just wasn't thought out enough. The idea that the werewolves change with the temperature is an interesting concept, but it seems too inconsistent throughout the book (although that is part of the mystery of the werewolves). I also had a huge problem with Grace's negligent parents- they seem like they are even more clueless than any parent ever could be.<br /><br />Despite these slight flaws, I thought that this book was definitely worth my time. Between the adorable romance, the suspense, and the very descriptive language, Shiver is a book that makes readers fall in love, and if you're anything like me you will be dying to get your hands on Linger.

0439023513|4.0|Hmm, what can I say about Mockingjay? While I haven't gotten around to reading very many reviews of it, I'm sure that everything I think has been thought by someone else, somewhere.<br /><br />The problem is, I can't decide what to think. I finished this book three weeks ago, and I still cannot come to a decision about whether I loved it, hated it, or if it was just okay.<br /><br />So, let's break it down.<br /><br />Characters: They just didn't seem right to me. They didn't feel like the characters that I was starting to get to know, and it's probably because that's what happens when everything changes. However, Katniss bothered me like she has never bothered me before.<br /><br />Pacing: Okay, this book was paced perfectly. There wasn't a page that went by that I didn't HAVE to know what happened next. I was reading during lectures, in between classes, at one of my roommate's dance recital... I could not stop.<br /><br />Plot: As far as what was happening, I'm not sure that I totally want to go with it. It made sense, but it just didn't sit right with me. There really is no good way for me to describe it, it's just an intuitive feeling I have.<br /><br />Ending: This is the hardest part to analyze. And I don't want to. Let's just say... ehhhh.<br /><br />Overall: I enjoyed the book. But in comparison with the first two, it could have been better. I plan on re-reading the whole series next summer, and perhaps I will come up with a definite opinion then.
0345495004|3.0|This book was very well written.  I am giving the book 3 stars because of the writing.  As for the story, I wanted to stop early on as I wasn't really interested in reading of 2 selfish people and their affair while their families paid the price. I did want to discuss it at book club so soldiered on.
0321704452|5.0|I have always been somewhat skeptical of the use of Powerpoints in presentations.  And I have been a victim of many, many dreadful and terrible presentations which consisted of bullets instead of lively content.<br /><br />This book is for all those of us who have a sincere interest in giving powerful presentations - with or without the help of Powerpoint. The subtitle, \\"Delivering powerful presentations\\", is somewhat an understatement.  If you follow the principles laid out in this book your presentations can become powerful AND make a difference.  Some people may call it infotainment.

B0035G5IOE|5.0|Highly recommended movie, done in a retro style. It took me two tries to watch it. First, when I spent 1 minute(because I saw that it was not computer animated) and switched to some other movie, and second when I decided to move on and couldn't stop watching after like 4 minutes. It's awesome. I am in love. I even think of reading the book now. Characters were nicely brought to life. I absolutely love them and foxes are my top favorite. Characters are so very charming! And details of the world are amazing. Very enjoayable movie. I want and will watch it again!
B00466HN6I|4.0|Director Duncan Jones, the man behind the small scale and well crafted film Moon, returns with an equally fascinating mystery that doesn't outstay it's welcome at just over 90 minutes long. To be honest, I didn't plan on seeing Source Code before yesterday. The trailer was a little on the weak side and the story seemed predictable, but those pesky critics can sometimes get me to the theater, especially if almost all of them are in universal agreement that the movie is really good.<br /><br />It's hard to describe this film without giving too much away. The main character (Jake Gyllenhall) has been given the ability to go back in time over and over again, for only 8 minutes a pop, in order to stop the train he is riding on from blowing up. There is a lot more to it than that of course. The government is behind the mission and the time traveling technology and there are many other twist and turns along the way, so I won't go into heavy detail here.<br /><br />The cast is good, but it doesn't feature a standout performance like the one Sam Rockwell gave in Moon. Then again, the clever script doesn't call for a one man show this time around.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with this sci-fi/thriller/mystery hybrid. It's worth a trip to the theater or a future rental at the very least. Source Code is something along the lines of what Alfred Hitchcock might be making if he was around today.

B002NXSRVG|1.0|Isn't this movie TEAM AMERICA...but without the intentional comedy and with, once in a while, real actors?<br /><br />The movie looks like a video game.  Scenes don't make sense but the movie never slows down enough to allow any logical scrutiny.  And yet everything sounds so cliched and familiar.  Flashbacks fill in holes...but aren't necessary in the least (besides, why lose an opportunity to show children beating the snot out of each other?).  Hundreds of people die but you KNOW nothing is going to happen to any major characters.  Amidst all the chaos, certain things will absolutely happen: chicks will always fight chicks, only major characters can be blown up, burned, shot at, and tortured--yet remain untouched.  (Dennis Quaid, the oldest, however, does take a whole ten minutes to go from badly-wounded, wheelchair, cane).  True love overrides all programs...blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />What was the point of all this?<br /><br />I say let the TEAM AMERICA guys do the sequel.  I have no idea if this movie did well enough to justify another entry...but I'm sure we haven't seen the last of crap like this.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Takes all the best elements from the genre and blends them perfectly.  I agree with the reviewer that said this feels more like a movie than a tv show.  I have no bad things to say about this series and cannot wait until season 2 comes out!

Unfortunately I don't have all the boots everyone else has with the \\"original\\" outtakes so I'm left with this crap? How ironic that they went to all this trouble to make an \\"authentic\\" facsimile of a lyric notebook, and then completely went against that by messing with the actual songs? Boooooo

0823023494|5.0|Tom Bancroft is a master character designer and animator who worked on multiple Disney films, including the Lion King and Mulan, for which he designed and animated the lovable character Mushu.<br /><br />Disney animated movies had that extra life in their drawings that other studios just couldn't recreate. Tom's explanation of character design flows into the \\"Illusion of Life\\" that Disney had worked so long to create; when you design a character, you research and create based on that specific character's personality and their role in the story. Tom even goes as far to describe which shapes work with what type of character as well as how to construct characters properly. Capturing a character's specific personality traits and making them stand out from the rest is what master Disney animators like Ham Luske, Bill Tytla, and Milt Kahl were able to do, and now, with guidance from Tom Bancroft, you can begin to learn how to do that as well.<br /><br />However, as Tom Bancroft said, \\"There are two things that make you great: practice and TIME for that practice to pay off.\\" Use this book to learn from and reference; but it will take you years of drawing and practicing these techniques until you can also master them.

0060794410|4.0|This was a great book to listen to. It made my long commute something i looked forward to everyday. The reader is the best audiobook reader i have ever listened to. Lots of enthusiams and energy.
B004SCI9BS|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. Each of their albums shows an evolution and the band trying new things. I think this one takes a slightly different direction from the previous but it's not a bas thing. You can't put out every album that sounds like it could be part of the last. You need some variation. I enjoyed it, and will be listening to this for a while. I definitely wish there were a few more songs, but I think the collection is nice. It's not a very cohesive album, but a nice mixture of different things. All of the songs have catchy tunes, guitar riffs, drum beats, or vocals. Non of the songs could be considered bland in my opinion.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD is just awesome. I've heard Adele's stuff before but this album is what really pulled me in. She has such a soulful and rich voice and the lyrics are like they were written from my own soul. I have this CD on repeat play. Goes perfect with a glass of wine :)

B004NSULHM|5.0|I love this album, and I actually give it 4 1/2 stars.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like the album at first.  I said to my husband when I first heard \\"Morning, Mr. Magpie,\\" \\"oh no, I fear I am not going to like this.\\"  I started to listen it the day I downloaded, and hadn't put it in my ipod yet.  I thought \\"Bloom\\" sounded completely different and odd.  For the second listen, I actually took the time to put headphones on and completely concentrate on the music.  This time I was completely impressed by the offbeat \\"Bloom\\", but again was underwhelmed by \\"Mr. Magpie\\", \\"Little By Little\\" and \\"Feral\\".  Then I got to \\"Codex, \\"Give Up the Ghost\\" and Finally, my favorite, \\"Separator\\"  It was \\"Separator\\" that actually got me.  I actually started to cry. I think the progression of their music is quite admirable and shows that they have grown up, and so has their music.  We can't be angry all the time, and we won't get that raw anger and passion from Pablo Honey, The Bends or Ok Computer.  We can't get the stark isolation that infused \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" or the in between album of \\"Hail to the Thief\\" which Thom even admits that he can't listen to.  I think they grew up when they made \\"In Rainbows' and realized that they didn't have to be emotionless.  That album still has the same messages as the other albums, but has a beautiful almost folky sound-I hear Nick Drake influences in it.  King of Limbs continues from there.  Their songs are approachable, and it is wonderful to hear Thom's falsetto-you can hear the emotion that he pours into his singing, and it also comes across in the music too.  \\"Codex\\" begins it, although unlike other reviewers, it is not my favorite, \\"Give up the Ghost\\" asks you to give up your ghost and Separator asks you to give in.  give in to the new sound.  I did!  I can't give it five because I am not completely convinced about \\"Morning, Mr. Magpie\\" and \\"Feral.\\"  Maybe I will learn to not be able to live without them too!  I am still repeating thisalbum now that I have also bought the cd so I can listen to it in my car.
144471032X|4.0|I am American, early 40s female who'd like to lose 20 lbs.  I am 5'4\\" and would like to get back to size 6.    While I never had a weight problem up until about 5 years ago, a combo of lowered metabolism with age along with increasing habitual laziness (only partially due to herniated disc), I've gradually worked my way up 20 lbs.    Over the last couple of years I've tried Weight Watchers twice along with a few fad diets.  With WW, I managed to lose 5 lbs only each time before hitting plateau and eventually losing patience only to gain it back.    Started Dukan 11 days ago and have followed the 5/5 plan to a T (except I admit for the 20 mins a day of walking, which I have been intermittent with).  My typically protein days are: morning- coffee with skim milk +-fat free cottage cheese, lunch-chicken or turkey, afternoon snack-lite laughing cow cheese and a slice or two of deli turkey, dinner- fish, chicken, turkey or ground turkey (I had lean red meat twice), evening snack- fat free plain yogurt (I add a dash of vanilla extract and 1 splenda).  I drink 2-3 liters of water/day and try to include some mineral water.  On protein/veg days I eat similarly, but with a bit less protein portion and add lots of veggies (no starchy, only those on the list).  The only condiments I've used are Dijon mustard, vinegar, dash of lemon/lime juice and spices.  If I have a question as to whether something is acceptable (sugar free jello for example), I do without.  I have not strayed once.    I went crazy missing carbs the first day - totally like withdrawal from a drug.  Second day was not so bad, and I can honestly say it's gotten easier with each passing day.  Toughest time I've had so far was resisting the strawberry margaritas at a friend's dinner party last weekend!    Results:  First week I lost 5 lbs, yay!  I am not a big person, and I've never lost so much weight so quickly!  Over the last 6 days I've lost 2 more lbs, bringing me below the \\"plateau\\" weight I was able to reachwith WW.  No disrespect to WW as I know it's a healthy route and works for many.  I am impatient, and I think that's why I'm having some luck with Dukan.  The switching it up every 5 days makes me feel as though I'm starting something new, and actually helps me to continue.  The quick weight loss is motivating.  I'm not a fan of protein weeks, not only because I miss the variety of other foods, but also because I know how dangerous those toxins can be to your kidneys/liver without PLENTY of water.  However, I am cognizant of hydrating, and understand that with Dukan pp is temporary.  Once I reach goal, I see no problem living with this after incorporating fruit and a couple of pieces of whole wheat bread, and in fact, that combination of foods is actually a great for long term.
B000FC1RCI|1.0|I'm not sure why this book is so highly rated but I'm mad I wasted my time reading it.  It was written well.  It was a page turner but it was drawn out and had a very anticlimactic ending.  So not worth my time or money.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Granted, I'm not a fan of the Kindle device. Personally, there's nothing wrong with it, if it meets your needs. But I'm a decidedly high tech guy. So the fact that it's not in color and can't be used to surf the web doesn't do much for me.     As for the software, however, from what I've seen so far, that's a totally different matter. I downloaded the software so that I could download a school book while I was waiting for the hard copy to arrive. Yes, I do prefer eBooks to paper, but when you're doing school stuff, I have to fall back to traditional, because trying to locate things and skim through the books is just that much easier.     So after having downloaded the Kindle for Android software to my tablet device, I was becoming a little concerned, because of the screen real-estate of my Android device, and the chance of perhaps being able to pull a copy of the matrix template out of my Android device didn't look good. So I'm sitting here, and then I started wondering if I might be able to download my book on to my laptop, that also has the Kindle, but for PC, software loaded to it. Then I might be able to pull that pesky diagram out and use it, rather than create a new one.    Well, like Gomer Pyle used to say, surprise, surprise, surprise! I opened the Kindle for PC software, and it immediately (after selecting the sync option, on the top of the page), started downloading my book, AGAIN! How sweet is that! Even though I can't pull the diagram out of the book, the screen real-estate makes all of the difference. I thought that Amazon would have totally jacked me, and made me stick with it on only one device. Man was I wrong, and I'm happy to admit it, too!    So I only gave them 4-stars, because it wont let me copy the diagram. But all in all, it's not bad at all. What this also means is that I should be able to create my account on any device that I personally own, and download my book to that device as well. I'm not sure if there's a limit, or if it will eventually tell me that I either have too many devices, or if I've exceeded the maximum downloads, but it's good to know that it can at least be downloaded to more than one device. This really is functionality that I wasn't expecting...especially in the today world of DRM (Digital Rights Management).

B003ITDN86|1.0|Considering it's been three years plus since they released a studio album, you'd think this album would be filled with many good songs. You're lucky if you can find one. With the huge selection of bands out there why would you  blow your money on this one? If this review sounds harsh...well the truth hurts. Don't bother.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney Spears has done it again, i got to hear most of the songs on her new album and this is simply the best, i love \\"Hold It Against me\\" and my my mind is stuck with \\"Inside Out\\" that i must say is a beautiful rythmic masterpieceQueen B gives a fascinating and inspirying energy throught the entire cd, and i dont like electro pop music so much but i am making an exception for Femme Fetale and is amazing, i recommended for all club-goes and obviously us Britney Fans, she proves yet once again she still is the Princess of Pop and now New Queen Of Pop
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It is very rare that I like let alone love all of the songs in a album. There's usually one or two that just don't do it for me like the others. I'm more than happy that this album is an exception, I absolutely love every song on the album! FLAWLESS!
B00005RFAI|2.0|Ok there are only a few songs that are good on this album. I don't even know what style of music this is. P!nk could have done better than this. \\"Dear Diary, Numb, Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like A Pill\\" are the only good songs. And most of the songs have bad words in it. This cd is really missundaztood. I'm glad that she changed her style of music. This is like rap, pop and something else that I'm not getting the point of. A lot of P!nks albums and songs are good, but this one is not all there.
0811870413|5.0|I have many books about baking artisan breads. While they all have great information, they do not measure up to this book. The process from start to finish is not convoluted with too much information so is easier to understand. In a different location the author goes into detail about what goes on during the previously mentioned process. I can now see where I have not succeeded and understand why. This book is a treasure and I am thrilled that I bought it. It was actually recommended to me by a great young man who has been a baker for years. He said it was a great book and would solve my problems and it sure has.
B000002G0P|5.0|Since my teenage days, when I first listened to Extreme while starting to learn to play guitar, Nuno has become one of my guitar heroes, not only for his soloing, but also for his versatility and ability to communicate through his guitar, wheter it would be a funked-up rock tune or his acoustic playing. But wow...he is truly musically gifted as a songwriter and keyboardist too!!    As for this album, it has great performances from all group members throughout, excellent tunes (not only the funky metal vibe from Pornograffitti, but this album is rather diverse but very likable all the way), which vary from heavy to mellow. Can`t say enough about it...simply great!!!    I used to have this album back then as cassette (way back then), somehow I lost it and decided to order it. My favorite Extreme album used to be Pornograffitti, but, having become somewhat \\"mature\\" (I hope), now I appreciate this album more for its diversity.    I also have recently purchased \\"Saudades de Rock\\"...excelent album...glad you guys came back togehter, I think you still have looong way to go musically and professionaly. Keep up the good work!!

0670022411|3.0|For the first half of this book, I was completely riveted. The author has done a beautiful job of melding history, alchemy, suspense and romance into an exciting tableau, not to mention that a female would have to be cold stone dead not to become besotted with the mysterious Matthew. Unfortunately, the midway point of the novel takes the same fatal turn as sitcoms whenever writers decide that a wedding or a baby would help boost ratings. All of that deliciously combustible chemistry that builds between Matthew and Diana manages to segue into a yawn shortly after they declare their undying love for each other. Yes, folks, if this were a TV series, it would likely not be renewed after the \\"I do\\". There are also enough elements borrowed from existing novels and movies that the time-walking ending is already setting up predictability and breaking the promising spell that prompted me to buy this title to begin with. My bet is that a baby will be introduced in Book 2 and that \\"a much beloved character\\" will die in Book 3. Let me know if I'm right.  Christina Hamlett
B004IE0G58|4.0|The Upside:<br />This is Green Day live. This far into their career, they still hit the stage with the same energy they had when they were a new band of wild-eyed kids. The songs include both new and old favorites, and having the blu-ray and the cd contain different performances doubles the pleasure. Sound-wise - the blu-ray and the cd are mixed well. The audiences and the performances on the cd seem well picked. Plus adding \\"Cigarettes and valentines\\" was a nice plus.<br /><br />The Downside:<br />Visually, the directing style hurts my eyes. It is grainy, jittery, blurry at times, and at times I feel I'm watching a fan-made YouTube video. Did this even need to be mastered to blu-ray? Rarely can you make out detail in the way you can on other remarkably filmed hi-def shows. I'm sure someone will say it's meant to reflect the fan experience, blah-blah... if i want that point of view I will jump up and down and convulse while watching.<br />Track-wise on the blu-ray, why not include the whole show? It makes it worse when they flash the set list and you see that there were far more songs played in this show. Being a fan since '94 it would have been nice to see some more of the older stuff.<br /><br />But on the Upside: It is only $17. The live cd is worth getting, so if you consider it a deluxe edition of the cd.. great. Crank up the cd, pump your fist up in the air and sing along!<br /><br />Overall... worth checking out. But take Dramamine.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|It's fun to play around with. Not something I will play every day, but a decent game to keep handy when you have a bit of time, like waiting at the doctor's office. Simple, clean and runs smooth as butter on my Epic 4g. Graphics aren't too bad either.  For only a dollar, I recommend this app to anyone.
B004G600A4|2.0|I bought this as a present for my little sister and she was thrilled to watch it right away. But I was disappointed with the movie case because the plastic was torn on the bottom of the case. The movie quality is fine so I won't be returning it, but I was sad the case was ruined.
030726999X|3.0|Difficult to follow with all the odd character names and places but not offputting for that reason alone. The biggest problem I had with these was the violence. It's over the top much of the time, and the book would've been much better if the author left more to the imagination.
B00466HN68|4.0|Duncan Jones pretty much made me a fan of his for life with his debut feature, Moon. The way the storyline unfolded along with Sam Rockwell's amazing performance, Moon was easily my favorite film of 2009. Also, seriously, how was Rockwell not even nominated for an academy award for that movie? So as word started making the rounds for Source Code being Jones' second film, I was immediately excited. While most people seem to be looking forward to Thor, Green Lantern, or Captain America this year, Source Code was actually my most anticipated film of the year. While Source Code isn't quite as impressive as Moon, it still has enough of Jones' strengths as a filmmaker along with a dash of originality injected into it to make it an extremely entertaining experience.<br /><br />The camera always seemed to be at just the right angle in this film. During the film's opening, the way we're looking down at the tops of skyscrapers from the heavens and practically gliding across ponds with ducks grazing the top of them as they fly made something simple seem so extraordinary. Sometimes it felt like you were on that train watching these people be engulfed in flames because of the camera work. A scene in particular where Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is handcuffed to a pole while Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) is crouched down next to him when the train explodes is a great example. You've probably seen part of it in some of the trailers. The slow-motion effect used in that scene is fantastic. It lets your brain process just how devastating this train bombing really was. There's another scene near the end of the film that uses the freeze frame technique and is done incredibly well, especially considering the context of the film at that particular moment. Duncan Jones and/or the crew he works with really seems to know how to use a movie camera in the best of ways.<br /><br />The originality in the film delves a little bit deeper than the trailer lets on. The concept of Source Code was enough to reel you in, but the way things unravel is what makes it special. Colter Stevens is a helicopter pilot from Afghanistan, but he can't seem to recall how he first arrived in the pod he now finds himself trapped in and he doesn't recognize the company he now works for. The source code is so much more than what anyone could have imagined including creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). Letting your mind wander and consider the possibility of technology like this actually existing is pretty astounding, but the other amazing factor about the storyline is the fate of Colter Stevens and what he has already gone through. Speaking of fate, the film's storyline is practically intertwined with it but the way it's revealed is certainly something to behold.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal handles the role of Colter Stevens very well. Seeing how the source code affects the state of both his body and mind is half of the beauty of his performance. The way frustration, determination, love, and inevitability is handled by Gyllenhaal's character is quite a sight to see. Michelle Monaghan plays the clueless love interest rather well, but she seems to risk life and limb more often than not for a man she once claimed she didn't know well enough to trust. Making the most of those last precious moments is the overall theme and it's safe to say that the film and its actors get that point across incredibly well.<br /><br />Source Code seems to be lacking that standout performance that Moon had, but still features a strong cast, a director who knows his way around a camera, and a sharp storyline that makes you think and is both original and compelling. Source Code is an incredibly solid thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat one minute and makes you ponder your existence the next.to reel you in, but the way things unravel is what makes it special.

B004EC5IV6|5.0|So I've loved Neon Genesis Evangelion for a while now. I have all the episodes of the original show and movie. Now Evangelion 1.11 was a pretty good remake, you know better looking and such, the only major difference was the last Angel in that one which was awesome. But when watching Evangelion 2.22 I went crazy for this anime all over again! My jaw was dropped for so much of it. This is definitely not the same as the original version, only a little bit of the storyline goes the same way.  I watched a lot of youtube videos of some clips of the movie but seeing them in the movie and with the storyline made them so much better. This is by far my favorite anime movie so far. The only thing that I would complain about the movie though would be how much they show off the girls and such. I mean it wasn't showing as much nudity and such as the original version, but still. It feels really uncomfortable when they're showing off stuff on a 14 year old girls body. I'm 18 and that just creeps me out. But atleast it isn't as bad as the Original as I said. As a side note my dvd case was in it's wrapping and such, but the sleeve for the dvd case had some worn edges on it which was kinda weird too me since it was new.    Anyway, absolutely loved this movie, it blew my mind, and I can't wait for the next one. I have never been this excited for the next movie in a series!
B002L5GQGY|1.0|After all the hype of all of the reviews praising this dvd, I have to be the one to set the record straight. Don't get me wrong, Joe Bonamassa is an unbelievable artist with great music. This dvd concert audio was by far the worst I've heard in a long time. I, myself have a great home theatre package with individual components of high quality. When I selected either \\"DTS\\" or \\"Dolby 5.1\\" it was all over the place. The guitar was loud (not balanced/equal with rest of the band) and almost \\"tinny\\" or \\"with echo\\" as well as the vocals. There were a few songs that had great drum solos which almost sounded like background noise due to the poor audio capture during this concert. Now, I know that most of you are going to say that I am wrong and it's my system but I played a couple of other concert dvd's with \\"DTS\\" (Peter Frampton, Eric Clapton) and they both sounded fantastic.[ Maybe this one was a dud! ]This is one dvd concert that I wish I never bought.
B003INBOEM|5.0|The blue-ray came in perfect condition and was actually cheaper by $8.00 than buying the dvd at the store I usually go to for these things.  I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday; it's now one of our favorite movies. :)  Highly recommended!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I came late to view this series, being unaware of it when it aired.  I bought the set and watched it in a week,  after which i was in mourning.  I have not watched Serenity yet...saving that for this weekend as a reward for doing my taxes:) I could NOT believe that Fox cancelled it after 11 episodes.  Are they IDIOTS?  Anyhow, I would rank it as the best TV series EVER! Loved every episode, everyone in the cast,  especially Nathan Fillion.
3836501910|4.0|I wasn't shocked or offended by the book, Im quite familiar with Terry's work and for $14 you are getting a fantastic deal, this is not coffee table material as half of the images are straight up pornography, however, portrait wise, you do get a really great selection that showcase Terry, and what he's into. The Title gives it away, it's Terry's World, can you handle it?

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is a marvelously talented author.  He is one of the very few and very precious writers with balance and consistency in all aspects of their craft and story.  The characters are real, vivid, lovable and understandable.  They are explored with depth and passion and also with wonderful humor.  At the same time, the plot rages forward.  I sit back in awe of how much raw Story the author has to share.  It is so alive.  It moves forward just as quickly as a story can.  And it's all Meat.  There is no filler that I could find.  None.  Two books, so far.  Each of them with So Many Pages!  And I could rattle off a dozen authors who would take three of Patrick's chapters, stretch them into an entire book and then stretch Patrick's \\"Day 1\\" into a ten-tome series, then \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" would be the \\"Return of Kvothe\\" - another ten-book series. AND those twenty books would stand a good chance of success!  Now imagine all that material condensed!  Do you know what that is?  It is Un-Selfish.  And un-commercialized.  It is pure storytelling from someone who has a Lot of Story to tell and who is not being stingy with it!  This is a writer with so much confidence in the depth of his creative well that he does not need to worry about running out.  I'm just grateful for that.  It's so so so very rare.<br /><br />An interesting, fun, intellectual and deep story.  Characters that are vivid and complete human beings.  Many, many pockets of unexpected delightful humor.  Beautiful language that is poetical without being corny or over-the-top.  No layer of dust, and yet no skipping details or skimming the surface.  It's perfect. That's all I can say (other than everything else I have already said!).  And when you have so much go right in a book... you know what's surprising?  It reads like a simple, straight-forward, entertaining, pleasant and lovable book.  You never want it to end.  Such a simple thing.  But so rare.<br /><br />My deep thanks to the author, and a whole-hearted recommendation to all his readers who are fortunate enough to still have the experience of this book in front of them and not behind.ndation to all his readers who are fortunate enough to still have the experience of this book in front of them and not behind.

0307269981|5.0|This is the exciting follow up book to \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  It continues following Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander further down the rabbit hole.  Lisbeth is accused of murdering three people, and Mikael will stop at nothing to prove her innocence.  He blindly follows his gut instinct that she is innocent and begins to unravel a conspiracy story that goes so far up it will blow you away.  The intrigue and suspense Stieg Larsson creates with this epic novel literally made it almost impossible for me to put down.  New characters are introduced and revelations about Lisbeth's past create some dynamic insight to her character.  If you enjoyed the first novel this one does not dissapoint.  In fact, I think it surpasses all expectations and immediately leaves you with the desire to finish the story and read the third novel.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|I found the entire book fascinating with no lagging or boring parts (which is rare).  I was surprised to see the negative reviews and wonder if they read the book at all.  Her \\"voice\\" in the book is very likable and even comedic at times.  I knew very little about actual experiences in prison for women beyond the typical horror stories, and I am glad to learn a more realistic view, even about minimum security.  As I read the book, I found myself saying \\"I would do exactly the same thing.\\"  Piper is a kind soul in many respects and she blended in better than most people would.  One note on how often it comes up that someone like HER shouldn't be there or is rarely found in prison.  I think some readers will interpret that as being snobbish or spoiled--her pointing out that pretty blonds with blue eyes deserve favoritism; in reality, she is pointing out how horrible the system is in it's discrimination.  By definition of the laws, there should be more blonds in prison, and the fact there are not shows how unfair the system is.      I have one question that kept going through my mind and it may contain a SPOILER for those who have not read the book:  What actual evidence did the Feds have that she committed conspiracy, beyond the finger pointing of Nora?  It had been years since her part in the crime, and there was no physical evidence at all.  So she ended up going to jail because someone said, \\"Oh yeah, and Piper carried cash for us.\\"  What if Nora had just said that because she was mad at Piper?  It's scary to me that she plead guilty and went to jail over a crime with no evidence at all except for someone mentioning her name.    It was a well-written book and I would highly recommend it.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|A number of reviews have complained about this disc -- everything from &#34;it's too grainy&#34; to &#34;it isn't wide screen.&#34;  While this disc isn't eye-candy on the level of The Wizard Of Oz or Gone With The Wind, it is an excellent transfer of the movie, and a worthy upgrade from the DVD if you are a fan of the film.<br /><br />First of all, remember a few things -- the film is over 80 years old, and the original negative is long gone.  That being said, the restorers did a fine job.  There are no scratches, specks or vertical lines to be seen anywhere -- they've all been removed.  Contrast and gray scale are excellent with deep blacks.  Some scenes (particularly all those scenes in the jungle) really show a remarkable amount of detail -- it's definitely hi-def!  Casual viewers might stick with the DVD, but film buffs and Kong fans will find this blu-ray essential.<br /><br />As far as the complaints are concerned, yes there is grain, but consider it a necessary evil:  if they were to scrub it all away, the picture details would go with it.  Plus it's not nearly so grainy as some would have you believe.  A few scenes -- especially those in the fog on the ship -- are EXTREMELY grainy, but most of the film is far less so, especially considering that the original negative is lost.  In any case it's not an issue -- it never interfered with my enjoyment of the film and I'm watching on a 50&#34; plasma from about 10'.  And for those don't know, this film wasn't made in wide screen -- the black bars on the side just mean that you're seeing the entire picture as it was filmed.<br /><br />Over-all, this is an excellent -- and accurate! -- representation of the film, and certainly the best it has ever looked on home video.  Remember:  blu-ray isn't designed to make everything look like a new movie, it's designed to to give you the most perfect recreation possible of the look of the original film elements.<br /><br />Hats off to Warner for a job well-done.<br /><br />NOTE:  To those that find the film &#34;unwatchable&#34;, check your TV settings.  Blu-ray should not have the sharpness turned up -- you're just adding video noise.  Also, having your TV set to &#34;vivid&#34; or &#34;sports&#34; will make film look much more harsh and grainy.  Having your set calibrated, or setting it to &#34;cinema&#34; will add to your enjoyment of the film.TE:  To those that find the film &#34;unwatchable&#34;, check your TV settings.

B001TIQT98|2.0|I have just finished listenng to this entire box set. I have to say that Bernstein's rendition of Mahler  is exceptional. It deserved much better than this. The packaging where there are 2 cd's to one carboard coverlet is horrible. The CD's float from one side to another and I am wondering how long before one of them gets scratched. Further, their breaking up the second Symphony into two CDs is unjustifiable. They could have shown the late Mr. Bernstein a little more courtesy in the packaging job which ruined the entire set for me.

Tried everything their tech   support recommended to no avail, so went back to using my  desktop Logitech microphone and leaving the POS mike tilted  up out of the way.
0439023521|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I don't know what I was expecting before I began The Hunger Games, but I didn't imagine to be so blown away by the story, characters, and fantastic writing. This is by far my favorite series, ever. The author didn't shy away from the hard parts, but gave each character such depth that you can't help but feel emotionally engrossed in the tale.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Carve out a chunk of time for this series. It is high quality and really nicely done. The scenery is breathtaking and authentic. I'll watch it again and again when I get time.
B000RJO58M|4.0|A lot of people like this movie.<br />I enjoy that you get both the HD dvd and regular DVD versions<br />of the movie for one price. Just make sure you have an HD dvd player if<br />that's the version that you want to watch.
038533348X|5.0|A friend had suggested I read this; I had only read one other novel by Vonnegut (Galapagos). The story and characters were engaging, and the writing style was fluid. Overall, this was a good read and is a book I am proud to add to my permanent library.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I own many exercise DVDs and like to mix up my workouts to eliminate boredom & to stay motivated.  Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred is now one of my favorites!!  It's a 20 minute workout, but it is fast-paced and intense.  Old school calisthenics, strength training & cardio make this a challenging worktout. After completing the workout for the first time, I was tired, sweaty & inspired!  And that was just on level 1!!  I have been doing the workout consistently for two weeks and have seen an improvement in my cardio fitness and have lost about 5 lbs so far.  I would definitely recommend this DVD as an addition to your workout library, you will not regret it!!!
B004GJYROG|4.0|I grew up with this movie, and so did anyone else born in the early 90s.  It has a special place within all of us.
B003F3NE1Q|3.0|This season is a mash up as two main characters depart and a new actors enter. Some are pretty flat. Did enjoy the webisodes featuring the young interns and happy to see nerdy Steve still around the hospital.  You can already guess who sticks around from the first introduction of the Mercy Westers. The crazy shooter is well-played/believable. The guy snapped and you can see it all over his face - certifiable!  Richard makes a great comeback at the end... the Chief is back!
159562015X|1.0|First, let me say that I am Me. I am an independent thinker. I am not a democrat, a republican, or an independent. I realize NPR tends to be liberal, but I also find significant amounts of accurate reporting from my local NPR station. I believe in the idea of individual responsibility. If I want a better life, it's up to me to make it so.     About this book.   Shame on Gallup for using self-improvement as an excuse to gather demographic data and try to fit everyone into demographic 'groups'. That is all this test does. It gives Gallup all the liberal data they need to paint everyone into demographic groups.     Here's how they are doing it:     1) The first thing Gallup does is ask about you, under the guise that they are required by law to ask. What is your color, gender, location, etc?     Boom, you belong to a 'group'.     2) Next they tell you that for all of the questions, you must rate how much you agree with the statements presented.     The problem is that they don't just say something like: \\"I strive to be responsible\\", and let you agree or disagree. Instead they pit \\"I strive to be responsible\\" against another statement like \\"I treat everyone the same, regardless of their color.\\" Now you have to choose which one you agree with more. What if I am both? Or neither? It's feelings vs. logic, as if you can't have both. This makes no sense, right?     It makes sense if you look at Gallup's goals:   A) Identify and pool everyone into demographic groups, white males, black males, females, latino males, etc.   B) Determine how each of these 'groups' think when they have to choose only between a liberal concept vs. a conservative one. They may as well cut to the chase and ask: 'Which do you agree completely with, Keynesian or Classical Economic theory?'     In the example above, Gallup is attempting to determine if my group's desire to be fair (i.e. to be politically correct) is more important than my desire to be responsible.   Why don't they just ask one question? \\"Are you a democrat or a republican?\\" Probably because of people like me, who don't paint themselves into political corners. They are trying to corral everyone into their little 'groups'. Like good democrats always do. What happened to the individual?     The tight controls on the test confirm my theory.     There is good reason for all of the controls on the test.     1) You have to buy the book to get the code to register.   2) You have to register by name, location, gender, color, etc.   3) You have only 20 seconds to answer each question.   4) You cannot go back.   5) You can only take the test once.     This is a controlled study. The feedback was just regurgitated input. A waste of time.   And the worst part? They want you to pay your hard earned dough to contribute data to their cause.   Again, shame on you, Gallup.     Do you want to improve your life?   Don't waste your money on this book. Here's all you need to do.     1) Be confident in yourself.   2) Find someone honest that you trust.   3) Ask them how you can improve.   4) Save $ and get real answers about the individual known as You.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|its a very good game for being free (3/31/2011). I dont think its worth the 99c that they want for it. quick rundown on the game. fruit and bombs get thrown into the screen which you have to chop before they fall. its a good game for a quick minute waster.
B004SS0884|4.0|Femme Fatale by Britney Spears is a great upbeat, never stop dancing album. I recommend you download these songs:    Gasoline  Inside Out  Criminal  Up N Down (on the deluxe album)  I Wanna Go  Hold It Against Me  Till The World Ends  Big Fat Bass    I have been playing Femme Fatale on my Ipod all week and have yet to get bored of it.     While I like this CD, I also recommend her earlier album \\"Blackout\\". No one really seems to talk about it because she was going through stuff in her life that was all over TV. Some of my favorites on that CD are Toy Soldier, Piece of Me, Break the Ice. Check that CD out as well. You'll love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app ever since they allow download to my phone.  At church, it is difficult to receive a signal sometimes, so I used to lose the ability to read my Bible there.  But now I have it downloaded to my phone.  I am unable to carry a regular Bible to church, so this is a really great substitute!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Great product. Easy to use. Just what I needed to watch the movies I've downloaded from the internet....if you are looking for a HDMI adapter for your Mac, look no further....
0195067142|5.0|If you are interested in the day to day life of combat infantry then this is the book for you. It has nothing about strategy of the war. It is a personal account of life on the front lines in the most brutal battles of WWII. It is an excellent read. I could not put it down.
B003Y74KC0|4.0|I really like this case. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the side felt a little flimsy when I would swipe my thumb (unlocking or moving aps around) and it collected a lot of dirt on the back.  Overall it's fantastic given the price. It provides adequate protection, a nice tactile feel (not too sticky so it slides in your pocket, but not too little texture that you worry you'll drop it).  Nice job amazon!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This version of Jane Austen's Persuasion is full of subtle nuances that help you feel every emotion that each of the character's are feeling at every moment. The pain and anguish of regretting not listening to your own instincts, instead you follow the advice of friends and society's values and norms. This story is a cry out to people that only you and your love one really knows the truth and that if you really love someone, you know whether or not it is worth jumping in and giving the relationship and each other a second chance.
0765326353|5.0|When I first started reading The Way of Kings I was slightly frustrated at the lack of information and the way the story seemed to jump from character to character, never seeing a link between plot lines.  I don't know where I was in the book, since I'm reading on kindle, maybe 200 pages in give or take and everything started to move into action and the plot really took off and I was completely hooked and could not put it down.  I found myself cheering characters on out loud because I was so enthralled in the plot, which has never happened before.  I cannot wait for the next book.  This series is very different from a lot of fantasy I've previously read.  The conceptual details, plot line, characters are marvelous...very original
0547258305|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. The plot is a little more simple, but the way she fills the pages is what counts. Fun survival stories mixed with heroism, mild violence, and romance. How could that go wrong?
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Absolutely MUST-SEE for anyone who is interested in the state of America's economy - and how we got here (and always will). This is it! Easy to understand in the \\"technical\\" stuff, but more importantly you'll finally understand a lot about our political world. GREAT.
B002ZG997M|5.0|This movie is great. It is about what is supposedly going to happen, (Islam takes over the world and/or Government removes religion to rule humans all over the world and/or 2012 Planet X really happens and/or Government kills 3/4 of human world population to forget about God and therefore brain washing left over humans) the point is it is every man for himself, Christianity has dissapeared, all exept for one Bible, \\"The Book of Eli\\".. Eli is the chosen one by God and it is up to him to keep Christianity alive. You have to see the movie to have an understanding of what may be our future, be prepared.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|There are quite a number of rock albums for which the mythology that surrounds their making is integral to the total experience. What would we make of The Basement Tapes if we couldn't picture Bob and the boys sprawled around in the back yard of that house in Woodstock, drinking a little rye, playing with the dog, and occasionally rousing themselves to make a little music? Would Heroes mean as much if we didn't know that Bowie recorded the title track within eyeshot of the Berlin Wall of which he sang on the classic title track?    But perhaps the ultimate member of this category is the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. As any student of rock legend knows, it was recorded in the summer of 1971 in a somewhat run-down old mansion in the south of France, the Stones having fled England to avoid paying the taxes that, combined with the shady dealings of the previous manager Allen Klein, threatened to bankrupt them. This mansion had supposedly served as the headquarters of the Gestapo during World War II, and according the Keith Richards, there were still swastikas painted on the walls and ceiling of the steamy basement where Exile was recorded in a haze of sweat, booze, and drugs. The result was their last, and possibly greatest, masterpiece.    That's the legend. The reality, as so often happens with these things, was a bit more complicated. The album was only perhaps half finished in that basement; the rest, including most of Mick Jagger's vocals and many of the horn parts, was overdubbed that autumn in a conventional recording studio in Los Angeles. And as for the swastikas... well, no one other than Keith seems to remember them, and there does not seem to be any documentary evidence linking the house with the Gestapo.    But it doesn't matter really. What's important is that this album sounds like it was recorded by a bunch of wasted outlaws crowded into a sweaty basement. Even the cover art, a disturbing collage of freaks and degenerates in grainy black and white, simultaneously entices and repels, as do Mick's vocals; while you may not always understand the words that he mumbles and slurs, you're pretty sure he's not singing about anything too wholesome.    Exile is a perfect argument for the album as a form. Many of the tracks here leave little impression when heard on their own, but even the weaker, more generic numbers -- \\"Shake Your Hips,\\" \\"Casino Boogie,\\" \\"Turd on the Run\\" (whose title is the most memorable thing about it) -- work in the context of the album as a whole to maintain the grungy ambiance. Exile isn't the sort of album that stuns you with amazing track after amazing track, but rather a group of songs that gets under your skin only with repeated listens. It's simultaneously some of the ugliest and most beautiful music in my collection; nothing else sounds quite like it.    I do sometimes wish we heard a little more from Mick Taylor, by far the most technically accomplished musician ever to play for the Stones. His perfect, fluid solo in \\"Shine a Light\\" only makes me wish for more. But then the Stones, almost uniquely among major rock groups, have always been defined more by their rhythm players than by their leads, a fact that gives at least some justification to their oft repeated (and still obnoxious) claim to be the best rock and roll BAND in the world. Richards, Wyman, and Watts could do tight and funky better than just about any group of white boys I can think of; the senseless bash and crash of most hard rock bands sounds tepid indeed next to a track like \\"Tumblin' Dice.\\" Like that one, all of the best tunes here abound with little touches that raise them up from their generically bluesy origins and mark them as the work of masters. Listen to the way that the vocals in \\"Rocks Off\\" briefly jump up an octave as Richard comes to forefront in lieu of Jagger at the 2:40 mark, or to the unusual herky-jerky riff that underpins \\"Ventilator Blues,\\" the ultimate basement tape of all.    And sleezy this album may be, but at this point the Stones still mixed sleeze with soul. Listen to the gorgeous singalong course of \\"Sweet Virginia,\\" which possibly includes Gram Parsons, who spent some time with the Stones in France before he was asked to leave for generally making an ass of himself. (Of course, one has to wonder just what Parsons could have got up to to have gone too far for this bunch...) A year or so later the soul would largely be gone, leaving Mick Jagger to ride around stage on a giant inflatable penis and the group to become a caricature of itself.    I don't know if the Stones were ever the best rock and roll band in the world, but on Exile they still sounded like a dangerous one. I don't even know if I entirely like this album, but, like those creepy photographs on its cover, it just keeps pulling me back in.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|Yes, they rip them off, or parody them, or copy them; but they do it in such a clever way that you forget that they are borrowing plots, or settings, or themes... It is creative, witty, and fun. I love this effin show!
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I wish I could give a better rating to such an anticpated movie.  Indiana Jones 4 looked good in the previews, and the characters and action stand out very well.  This time, Indy is fighting the Russians during the Cold War, and this works well, nothing bad.      Unfortunately, with this story, it became too goofy, and seemed slapped together after almost twenty years since part three.  Some of the action sequences are bad (fighting evil CGI ants-please), and without telling you the ending (which really ruined the movie for me), I think Indy 4 falls short of the standards in the first three films.    I am looking forward to a part 5 and then they need to call it quits.  Harrison Ford is almost 69 years old at the time of this review, so finishing part 5 will hopefully come sooner, rather than later.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. What a great read. Nothing like I expected but what a great twist at the end. Thank you rosamund look forward to reading your next book.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Had the dreaded Droid installation problem and followed all the way through the recommended fix. Couldn't find the necessary .asec file to delete. So disconnected USB from computer and installation worked immediately. Maybe just opening android_secure folder is enough.  Game great, but no surprise there.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|This is a great set, lots of extras, but one major drawback. The movie doesn't have an extended eddition. In order to watch the video with the deleted scenes playing where they should be in the movie, you would have to do some major video editing, or run 2 disks at once and swap between viewing the movie disk and the extras disk, and you would have to know exactly where the scenes go, because half the time it doesn't tell you where they go in the movie.     Other than that this set doesn't have many flaws in my opinion.     Titanic is a good love story, epic historical tale and there are tons of extras, commentaries, etc etc. All in all it's worth the cash to buy this if you are looking for a good Titanic set.
B000LXH11C|5.0|The time and product just right!, I am pleased with them. The Cd is in great conditions, The Alan Parsons Project is a great group
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I simply bought this book because it got good reviews and it was only $.99. I thought it started off a little slow but the more iread the less I could actually put it down. This book definitely sucked me in and it was such a good deal! Would totally recommend it to a friend!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I got this as a free download and I cannot fathom how this can be a top download. All you do is cut fruit. It was borning after 1 minute.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made! Great effects, great plot, looks great on HD, can't wait to see it in 3D!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Anyone else having this same issue? Do I have to wait till May to play more angry birds? If so, that's a major bummer! =(
B002UNMWAG|2.0|This movie left me with a lot to wonder. How can you make such an amazing first movie, and come up terribly short the second time? I thought that after all the years between the movies, they would come up with something a little better than this!!
1594202842|4.0|This book was a good read, but not nearly as good as what I expected it to be. There is certainly a lot of drama, and it's a page-turner, but I guess I wanted a more complete ending. Now I will have to wait to see what happens down the road in 10 or 20 years for the real ending.   I do have to say, this woman has a lot of guts so openly criticizing American/Western parents while still having to live amongst them. I think a lot of what she says is just for the shock value though, and the books sells...so what can you say?
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|What a fabulous inside view behind the velvet curtain of the fashion world by shadowing the iconic and legendary Anna Wintour. See fierce fashionr runways, messy ateliers in fashion capitals like New York and Paris, and see how the fashion world comes together under the Vogue umbrella. Refreshingly real and uncensored, this is a great documentary for every sartorialist's collection.
0312379293|4.0|Okay, so I'm probably the last person on the planet not to have read a previous book by Jeffrey Archer.  But I confess, I haven't.     Despite the fact that he's an international bestseller and has written novels, short stories, plays and practically everything else, I haven't read a word.  Why?  Mostly because I convinced myself long ago that British stories just didn't interest me - even if they were about criminal proceedings (as is this one) at the Old Bailey.    I thought that the unfamiliar type of legal proceedings and the cultural differences in the British would make reading this type of novel more difficult to relate to and cause it to be less satisfying.      I was wrong.    This carefully written and intricately plotted thriller will have you reading well into the night.  It begins with an unsophisticated and good-hearted young man being framed for the murder of his best friend.  On the night Danny Cartwright proposed to Beth Wilson, he is arrested and charged with murder.  Since there are four prosecution witnesses against him, he stands little chance at trial and is found guilty.    Danny is sentenced to Belmarsh prison, a high security jail from which no one has ever escaped.  But, this being a novel of determination and revenge, Danny finds a way out and the chase is on to find and obtain justice from the witnesses who not only testified against him, but were guilty themselves of murdering his best friend.    It's an exciting story and the courtroom scenes are expertly handled.  And I found that instead of being put off by the unfamiliar English manners and colloquialisms, I began to enjoy them.     In one scene, Danny is in prison being visited by his fiancée Beth:     \\"How's the garage coming along?\\" asked Danny, changing the subject.    \\"Dad's slowing down a bit,\\" said Beth.  \\"I wish I could convince him to give up smoking.  He never stops coughing, but he won't listen to anything Mum or I have to say on the subject.\\"    \\"So who has he made manager?\\"    \\"Trevor Sutton.\\"    \\"Trevor Sutton?  He couldn't run a whelk stall.\\"    \\"No one else seemed to want the job,\\" said Beth.    \\"Then you'd better keep a close eye on the books,\\" said Danny.    \\"Why?  You don't think Trevor is on the fiddle?\\"    \\"No, but only because he can't add up.\\"                Don't make the mistake I did of overlooking writers like Jeffrey Archer.  This novel will have you reaching out for other British writers.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan took a turn I did not expect. I knew Nina was a disturbed soul but not to this extent!  Talk about haalucinations.  She had the grand mal seizures of hallucionations!  It was fascinating to watch this film unfold and watch as Nina slowly slips into the grasps of insanity.  Everyone can relate to her on some level.  natalie Portman was fantastic and I feel that she deserved the oscar, hands down.  Winona Ryder was barely in the film but it was nice to see her acting again. I also enjoyed the perfromance by Mila Kunich.  Black Swan is a fantastic dark thriller with a great story and superb acting.
B004IJZFP4|4.0|One more edit here...gitar freek posted the same comment a couple of times on response to other posts so I went to the Bolin site to read the comments that Greg Hampton (the producer of this CD) posted. Interesting read.     My only complaint is that there in no reason (in my humble opinion) that these comments/perspective should have included in the liner notes. So that being said onto the comments as previously posted.        OK...it's time to change the original review since I now have the CD and have been listening to it pretty consistently so my comments have changed accordingly.     Right off the gate I'm giving this 4 stars instead of the five I gave it prior. Mostly this is due to the complete lack of information about what the sources of these tunes really are.     I do have to say however that if you are a real Bolin fan that the version of \\"Wild Dogs\\" alone makes the purchase of this CD worthwhile. \\"Lotus\\" for whatever flaws it has is a close 2nd.     In the meantime I've put most all of the versions that I have together so I could actually listen to what's here and there. Any CD titles noted other than the \\"Whips & Roses\\" releases were released at some point by the Bolin Archives.     You may take my comments as they are, for what they are worth and with a grain of salt.     The Grind - there are now three other versions than the LP proper. They all have a little bit different feel/sound with the new version on \\"Deluxe\\" some 2 minutes longer than the original LP. The \\"1974 LA Demo\\" from \\"From The Archives Vol 2\\" is clearly a different animal than the other versions.     Homeward Strut - again three other versions. Each a little bit different with the \\"Deluxe\\" version taking nearly 30 seconds before diving into the riff proper. The \\"Demo\\" version from \\"Snapshot\\" is very raw and the shortest of all of the versions.    Dreamer - three more versions. Each one seems to have a little bit different piano intro. The \\"Early LA Demo\\" from \\"From The Archives Vol 2\\"is, as with \\"The Grind\\" a different animal and clocks in at just over a minute less than any other version. Glenn Hughes is only on the LP proper version.    Savannah Woman - three more here. The LP version is shortest of the three. The \\"Demo\\" version from \\"Snapshot\\" has over 30 seconds of Echoplex stuff before the song starts and has a more extended solo workout, while the \\"Whips & Roses\\" version gets into it right away and has Tommy blazing away with a heavily distorted solo at the end. The \\"Deluxe\\" version subs \\"vodka and grapefruit\\" for \\"gin and tonic\\" line in the lyrics. Again a nice solo workout here.    Teaser - and we have...you guessed it three more. The \\"LA Demo\\". once again from \\"From The Archives 2\\" being a different animal. The \\"Whips and Roses\\" version opens with some Echoplex work (similar to SW above). The \\"Deluxe\\" version is nearly a minute longer than the LP proper and has a different feel and Tommy plays a lot more over the whole thing and the whole thing has a very funky vibe.     People, People - only two versions and I can't really tell the difference between the version on \\"Whips and Roses II\\" and \\"Deluxe\\". They are practically the same length. The ringer here are the two versions of \\"Brother, Brother\\" from \\"Naked\\". Obviously the tune in its original version.     Marching Powder - two other versions here under the same name plus at least two more versions under the title \\"Journey\\". There is no (apparent) sax work on the \\"Whips and Roses\\" version. The \\"Deluxe\\" version clocks in at nearly two minutes longer than the LP version and the sax is back.     Wild Dogs - here again we have two more versions plus an acoustic demo from \\"From the Archives Vol 1\\". One of the versions is another of the LA Demos (also from \\"Archives Vol 1) and like the other LA Demos has it's own groove. The \\"Deluxe\\" version is the capper tho'. Dig it late on where Tommy changes the rhythm figure to kind of a double time and the boys in the band have to react. As noted abovethis track alone is worth the purchase of the CD as Tommy whips out nearly everything in his trick bag.     Lotus - two more versions here, each longer than the other. The \\"Whips & Roses II\\" version features a count in and the processed vocals that are also on the \\"Deluxe\\" version. I think these are the same version/recording with the \\"Deluxe\\" version remixed and extended.     Crazed Fandango - funny how this \\"outake\\" has some five different versions! The 1st version appears on \\"Archives Vol 1\\" and is clearly noted as the \\"Teaser outtake\\". It appears again \\"Whips & Roses\\" and seems to be the same track. Version #3 is on \\"Whips & Roses II\\" and is nearly a minute and half shorter and does not have the sax playing the riff with Tommy. Version four is the 1st one on \\"Deluxe\\" and appears to be the same as above but re-mixed. The fifth, and final, version is the 2nd one on \\"Deluxe\\" and is shorter than the 1st two versions and longer than the 2nd pair. There is no sax at all here and where the opening sax solo was on the other versions is now a piano solo.     I should note here that if you like this CD you should check out the 35th Anniversary version of Deep Purple's \\"Come Taste The Band\\", which is a double CD. Disc 1 is a full on remaster of the original stereo mix. Disc 2 (as with all of the DP anniversary releases) is a full on re-mix (by Iron Maiden's producer) with the tracks extended.     If all of the original Teaser tapes existed then the above approach would be the ideal. But, lacking that, and in any case, I would say  that you should approach this as with all of the TB archives releases: as is and enjoy it for what it's worth and for Tommy's brilliance.      Cheers Friends
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I really love this album.  It is my new daily commuting music.  Yanni's earlier albums sounded more symphonic and a little more dreamy and slower paced.  This album seems more electronic and has more of a dance beat to it.  You'll hear a lot of the standard Yanni keyboard sounds, but he has added plenty of new sounds too.  In general, the album is more digital sounding - which I liked for a change of pace.  The guy is a genius.  As someone with some musical training, his complex beats and harmonies just make me smile.  Yanni clearly spent a lot of time and effort putting these songs together.  No, it is not his \\"old\\" style, but something new.  If you listen to it a few times, you might get hooked.  I'm glad he went in a little different direction with this one.
B004ISVH7U|3.0|This album was also mixed in quad in the 70's. That version should have been included in this anniversary release.
0375836675|4.0|My teacher read us this book over the last couple months and it was great. It starts off very interesting with the bank robbery, and just keept going. The Author Marcus Zuzak is excellent at using descriptive words. He desribes things that you would never think of being described in that way. Nobody in our class could guess what happened at the end of the book. It keeps you guessing the whole way.
B002ZG980U|3.0|This movie was good. You have to really pay attention or you will get confused as to what's real or part of the dream state that's the theme of the movie. The plot is strange but this is  makes the movie worth watching more then once. I really enjoyed it.
0439023483|4.0|This book was chosen in the book club that I belong to so I'm not sure I would have ever picked it up myself.  Surprisingly I loved it.  The last 200+ pages I could not put down.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Morton proves to be one of the most gifted historical fiction authors in her debut.  The storytelling is amazing...the voices of her chracters are authentic...and her writing style is addictive. The last page literally left me speechless and SO glad I had read this book.

B004NSULHM|4.0|It's hard to review an album by veteran artists' without comparing it to their previous records. At first, I didn't like the album as much as I liked `In Rainbows', but after listening to this album a few times, I've come to like it a lot. Radiohead have truly given critics and fans a new view of them with their new sound and style. I thank lead vocalist Thom Yorke for his freaky dance in the music video for `Lotus Flower.' Whenever that song plays, I now have something funny to imagine (I'll sometimes do my own weird dance). That song also sets the perspective for the album title `The King of Limbs.' This isn't a concept album, but this is Radiohead at their loosest. This is a great record.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this movie, I was almost certain that I did not want to see it. Too often I have observed society glorifying violence and evil in entertainment. I did NOT want to watch a cartoon that made the bad guy the hero.    However, on a long flight across the Atlantic, I ended up in a seat which had a damaged video system. \\"Despicable Me\\" was the only movie that I could watch in its entirety. And was I surprised!     The lead character grows and develops moral priorities during the story - he truly is a hero in the end! And the supporting characters were adorable, especially the \\"minions.\\" These twinkie-shaped characters are like sweet and slightly naughty children. The three little girls in the story also develop their trust and love, despite having had little love in the situation they came from.    The depth of the story-writing was completely unexpected. One theme is the influence parents have on what paths their children follow as adults, whether for good or evil. And the \\"second reality\\" of the bad guy underworld is quite detailed, even down to an evil underground banking system where the villains take out loans to support their evil plans.    The story is basically about second chances, whether for a bad guy to turn good, for a mother to finally accept and love her son, or for three sad little girls to find a loving home. Although it is definitely not for very young children, it is definitely a movie the whole family can enjoy.

0399250573|5.0|SCORPIA    The terrorist organization known as Scorpia has been in shambles ever since it was overthrown not once, but twice by an unlikely 14-year-old British spy named Alex Rider. The first time was completely unexpected, as MI6 had never before deployed a teenager to do their dirty work. The second time was, well, embarrassing. Now with Scorpia struggling to maintain their foothold --- and dignity --- within the organized crime world, it has decided to accept one final mission to reassert itself as a world power. This time Scorpia is going to draw Alex into a scheme all of its own, and above all else, failure is not an option.    The plan is quite simple. Dying billionaire Yannis Ariston Xenopolos wants the ancient Elgin marbles to be returned to Greece as a final wish. In order for this to happen, something must be done to motivate the British government to give them up. Scorpia has just the right motivation --- expose Alex as a government agent and connect him to the future assassination of the United States Secretary of State. All that is needed is a reason to get Alex to Cairo, Egypt, for the upcoming Secretary's speech and to document his involvement. While MI6 may be a top government organization, Scorpia has a few tricks up its sleeves that will put everything in motion.    ALEX RIDER    After surviving the worst year of his life, 15-year-old Alex Rider finally feels like he has shed off the brunt and brutal nature of being a spy. While the scars remain, both internally and externally, Alex has accepted that change must occur for his life to return to what it was before he became involved with MI6. He enjoys school, has real friends, and continues to thrive with his housekeeper, Jack Starbright. He's even thinking about life after high school, and the last thing he needs or wants is to become embroiled in the center of another government conspiracy. When you're in the spy business, though, you sometimes have no choice.    Alex wanted to lay low, but the sniper who tried to take him out while he was sitting in class forced him to do otherwise. After tracking down the sniper and giving him a taste of his own medicine, he finds himself once again sitting in the presence of Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones from MI6 headquarters outlining his new mission. Reports have surfaced of hostile activity taking place at a prestigious school in Cairo, Egypt, and all MI6 wants Alex to do is enroll as a student and report back on what he finds. It's that simple. If there is anything Alex has learned, though, it's that missions are never that simple. Despite his reluctance, he agrees to go for his own safety, and this time Jack Starbright decides to tag along.    Thus begins the final mission of Alex Rider. He has survived gunshot wounds, burns, crocodiles, crazy madmen, and much more, but will he survive a terrorist organization that will stop at nothing until he is buried in the ground?    Anthony Horowitz has decided to end his popular series while on top. Devoted fans will be sorry to see the improbably teenage British spy go, but the long celebrated books end in a satisfying, if not bittersweet, conclusion. SCORPIA RISING is packed full of the usual thrills and chills, but also has a few surprises lurking around every corner that will catch you off-guard. Alex Rider may indeed be all grown up, but his legacy lives on in his epic adventures.        --- Reviewed by Benjamin Boche

B000002UTH|5.0|Always growing and experimenting as musicians and artists the Chili Peppers decided to take a cue from their fantasic debut album a year earlier and increase the funk strains of their music. In keeping with that spirit the band made some important changes this time out. The added guitarist Hilal Slovack who wound up really beefing up their rhythm stylings even more so than before but also enlisted the production of George Clinton,someone who from hearing the last album was someone greatly admired by the memembers of the band. That being said this is very much an extention of their debut only with less of the wild abandon for the most part with a sound growing more towards the cleaner sound of a classic R&B/funk style production. And for a band with such an eccentric,spastic and and hyper personality it was going to be interesting how this would turn out.<br /><br />  For the most part it's a complete success. The first seven songs on the album \\"Jungle Man\\",\\"Hollywood\\",\\"American Ghost Dance\\",\\"Nevermind\\",the title song,\\"Blackeyed Blonde\\" and a very well done version of Sly's \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\",the bands first cover song are all a seemless blend of P-Funk style wit,eccentricity and often enough just flat out craziness. The rhythm guitars,horn charts and the spot on stop/start funky drumming are right out front for all to hear. They show absolutely no shame whatsoever here in being one of the strongest white funk bands of their time and continue to ride the wave of their first burst of rhythmic and instrumental flight of fancy. The last quarter of the album includes songs such as \\"Battle Ship\\" and \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\". These short punkish tunes are alright but kind of ordinary and have very little to do with the funky proceeding,accept maybe to showcase their rockier connections. That ends quickly as we're back to the P-Funk meets Dr.Seuss jam \\"Yertle The Turtle\\".<br /><br />  I am not sure if anything the Chili Peppers did after this album had quite the same thoroughly funky impact that these first two records did. True to this very day they never have and likely never will fully abandon funk since it's at the very basis of their musical sound.  And that might be one of the reaasons these two earlier albums-well actually pretty much everything they made before [[ASIN:B000002LQR Blood Sugar Sex Magik]] kind of gets ignored accept by either hardcore fans of the band or huge funkateers looking for the music they desire in areas in the record store outside the R&B racks. That latter scenerio,by the way is more or less how I discovered this bands earlier albums along with some literature on the subject. But however you get into this music it'll make you want to move and even make your mind wander into some interesting places if you let it take you on a natural musical trip.I am not sure if anything the Chili Peppers did after this album had quite the same thoroughly funky impact that these first two records did.

1439102724|2.0|I am a huge fan of Jodi's writing. I especially love how she developes the characters and you get to live through their eyes. I felt she didn't develop the characters to the degree that we usually get from her writing. She skimmed over a huge part of Zoey and Vanessa's relationship, and it was not believable that Max would sleep with his brother's wife, I mean isn't he a born again christian? And then what's the deal with Lucy? Her character was so sadly lacking that I didn't really get what happened in the end. I felt there was no closure, that once Zoey decided to give up the fight that Lucy just disapeared. What happened to her character? In Jodi's other books you get to see how the characters end up, but not in this book. I'm very disapointed after reading this book.

1439102724|5.0|I'm truely shocked at the negative reviews.  I've read a dozen or so of Picoult's books and this one rates right up at the top for me.  The subject matter really didn't interest me, yet I was SO drawn into the storyline because of Picoult's superb character development.  Once I started, I couldn't put the book down.  So many twists and turns!  I highly recommend this one!!
B00164EAC8|3.0|It is what it is.  The special effects, circa 1998, have held up well and deserve 5 stars.  The story line, the acting and especially the dialogue, are uniformly awful and deserving of 1 star.  Thus, I've split the difference.  The only way to enjoy Godzilla, in my view, is on a large screen, with a really good surround sound system, and with low expectations.
B004QYZATW|5.0|Someone wrote that if you were a fan of movies from  the 50's and 60's you would appreciate this film.  I am and I did.  Not everything has to be splashy.  I read a review that said Johnny Depp only spoke 30 times throughout the film.  And the problem with that? Only someone who still sees Mr. Depp as eye candy and not the brilliant fellow that he is would have issue with his lack of lines.  A film is about pictures.  Not always words.  You want words read a book.  You want a beautiful, funny, and hitchcockesque film that makes you wonder how it's going to turn out and smile when the end comes? Watch The Tourist.

B001WCN23W|5.0|Yes, I would agree that the 1994 re-master of Sticky Fingers from virgin records as a opposed to the 2009 universal re-master,is a better sounding re-master. This is my favorite Rolling Stones record of all time. Every song is a masterpiece. This is mid-period Rolling Stones with Mick Taylor on second guitar. Brown Sugar is an incredible song. The other songs are just as great. Songs such as Sway, Wild Horses,I got the blues, Bitch, Dead Flowers (a great song to do as a cover song), Can't you hear me Knocking, and Sister Morphine are essential listening experiences. This is blues and roots rock at it's best with no apologies needed. The guitar playing sounds like it comes from the soul and played with an attitude that I cannot discribe. If you do not own Sticky Fingers....get it.

B004T4LUPW|2.0|I bought CalenGoo with the intention of comparing it to my current calendar app, Pure Calendar Widget. The results were disappointing on the widget-side. The deal-breaker was the lack of a scrollable homescreen agenda widget. I'm a big fan of being able to see upcoming events at the flick of a finger, however far into the future I choose, and I didn't see a way to do that with CalenGoo. Note: Using the scrollable feature on PCW requires a homescreen replacement like Go Launcher EX or Launcher Pro, both of which I have.    The Month calendar view in the app looks kind of drab--the interface looks like it belongs on an old WinMo phone, and that's on my Captivate's Super AMOLED screen--but that's personal preference, and you can (mostly) customize the appearance (can the weekend colors within the grid be changed?). The text in this view is understandably miniscule, and I wouldn't use it for anything besides getting a general idea of when I'm free or not. You can zoom in with the aid of a zoom button on the bottom, but I couldn't help but feel like pinch-to-zoom would have done the job perfectly.     The Agenda view was nice, clear, and functional. No frills in a good way. The Week and Day views were equally useful, and the ability to drag & drop for event editing is great (and functionality EVERY touch-screen calendar should have).    Ultimately, CalenGoo is not a bad app. I just think there are much better options. PCW suits me and my needs better.It's SUPER-customizable and sits right on one of my homescreens. Oh, and it's cheaper. $5 for this app doesn't seem worth it, no offense to the developer.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|I find this show completely addicting. The second season does not disappoint- the characters are even more gorgeous and the drama always provides a nice escape from reality. My only complaint is that Ryan's BA attitude seems to have disappeared. But he's still cute!
B000W1T26A|5.0|What a great album! It raptures you into a world of guitar noise that goes from sounding dream-like to screeching fluidly.  There is nothing else that you can really say about this album...I mean it is one of the few rock albums to be included in the Library of Congress!  Plus, if you don't have this album then you can never call yourself \\"indie\\"...

B003WTE886|5.0|You can see in previous Taylor Swift reviews, that I thought her lyrics were a little on the childish side and that I hoped they would evolve with her. With this CD, I got my wish. Her lyrics appear to honestly reflect who she is. And if that's true, she's not always a good person. But emotionally, she's very deep. And she's not ashamed for people to know what's in her heart.<br /><br />I've had this CD since it became available on Amazon. I was listening to it on the way home today, trying to figure out what about it was different from any other CD I've ever listened to, and it hit me: Every song is like a painting. This CD is a masterpiece, and it firmly cements Taylor Swift's place in the world as a true artist.<br /><br />With this CD, Taylor puts her heart on her sleeve, and stands there in tears, candidly presenting herself without holding back, and without affectation. In The Girl in the Dress (and in Dear John) she shamelessly presents her pain, without judgment or anger, to a past lover. In Back to December, she talks about her mistakes and blames herself for the heartbreak she has caused. In Speak Now she's a young woman who shamelessly, selfishly and publicly stops a wedding to run off with the groom, because she knows she's a better match than the jilted bride.  In Mean, she taunts a bully. A bully who called her a bad singer, no less.<br /><br />Taylor's lyrics are more literal and direct than most artists', in my opinion. That's especially true with this CD. I don't see much symbolism - the songs mean what they mean. But that doesn't keep my imagination from getting involved. To the contrary, the CD weaves a beautiful, aching, emotional tapestry of loves had, loves lost, revenge and humor.  It's just too wonderful to describe. This collection makes me feel good. And sometimes sad, though still in a good way.<br /><br />She's still young, and she has a long career ahead of her. But this CD is so good, I fear it could be her best work ever. I hope she doesn't get lazy like a lot of singers and start buying her lyrics from other songwriters. Because her wonderful voice and her unique, honest lyrics belong together. With \\"Speak Now,\\" she proves herself to be not just a great singer, but one of the greatest artists of our time.<br /><br />Before this CD, I was sort of fan. Now I'm completely hooked. If you only have one Taylor Swift album, this is it.gers and start buying her lyrics from other songwriters. Because her wonderful voice and her unique, honest lyrics belong together. With \\"Speak Now,\\" she proves herself to be not just a great singer, but one of the greatest artists of our time.     Before this CD, I was sort of fan. Now I'm completely hooked.

1439190275|5.0|This book was a life changing event.  This is not just a diet book, this is new way of living.  It is very well laid out, easy to read and understand.  It is useful for anyone who wants to lose a few pounds or wants to change their lifestyle.  It follows through to help you develope a lifetime maintenance plan that you can really follow, really live with.

0307454541|5.0|For a long time I refused to read this series thinking it would be as much of a letdown as The DaVinci Code (a decent thriller, but certainly not deserving of the attention it got.)  Fortunately, Teh Girl with the Dragon Tattoo did not disappoint, and I've since read The Girl Who Played with Fire (and I've just ordered The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.)<br /><br />Full of breathtaking twists and turns as well as very human, flawed characters, this series makes me want to discover more Scandinavian writers.<br /><br />My only quibble is that Mikael Blomqvist is a little too irresitable to women - a little James-Bondish touch.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|This is Josh Whedon at his best!  If you have not seen yet Toy Story, the Buffy the Vampire Killer movie or TV series, or the Serenity movie or Firefly TV show, this is not a bad starting point to get to know this writer/director.  If you have seen any of these, then you know what you are in for! Josh Whedon is a master of the plot twist, and he can get you interested in any of the characters he brings to the screen.<br /><br />Dollhouse is one of those TV series that, like Firefly, makes you wonder why it was cancelled.  On the bright side, you get to see a complete story evolve and come to a closure so you don't feel like you were left hanging.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended!
0756404738|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a little worried about the book. However, it turned out to be a real page turner and I had to force myself to put it down each night, so I could get some sleep. Looking back at some of the negative reviews, I think many were caused by expectations that the Chandrian plotline be advanced. While there was some advancement of that plotline, most of the book focused on various other exciting adventures. And it was great!

B002EWD0I6|5.0|My first reaction to Lark Rise to Candleford was, \\"Oh, it's Laura Ingalls Wilder for British people.\\"  In many ways that is an accurate comparison.  Both authors wrote memoirs of their childhoods/adolescence in a rural late 19th Century setting.  They both chronicled a way of life that was quickly vanishing in the 1930's and 40's when they wrote their books even if each was writing on different continents.  Both women's work can invoke a nostalgia for days gone by even for people today who are far removed from that time period.    It is their adaptation for television where the paths of the two works sharply diverge.  The adaptation for Laura Ingalls Wilder's books (given the name of her second book, Little House on the Prairie) were very sadly given a great disservice by quickly becoming a vast vat of sickly sweet treacle whose only purpose was provide a weekly pull at the nation's heart strings.  Wilder's works, while at times purposely nostalgic, never pandered to the audience in such a way.    The BBC's adaptation of Flora Thompson's trilogy is what one would have hoped Little House on the Prairie would have been.  Characters are allowed to develop, the story lines seem to have an arc, and while the characters are obsessively polite and understanding by 21st Century standards, one is still able to maintain the idea that they derive from people Thompson may have known from her childhood and not two dimensional cutouts fabricated by network executives.  If you read Laura Ingalls Wilder's works as a child like me and then were vastly disappointed in the TV series then you have a second chance with Flora Thompson and this BBC adaptation of Lark Rise to Candleford.

0399250573|5.0|Anthony Horowitz has led readers on incredible journeys -- across continents, through city streets and beneath them, from the stale halls of MI6 headquarters to the greasy oil rigs of the Pacific. And now, he brings us to the final chapter in Alex Rider's story: SCORPIA RISING.<br /><br />Twice before Alex has foiled the criminal organization known as Scorpia. And now they want revenge. They want to take Alex Rider down and make sure he never has another chance to spy for MI6 again. And this time, they will stop at absolutely nothing to make sure Rider comes back to England in a body bag. And Alex has no idea the incredible amount of evil that has joined forces with Scorpia to make sure it happens -- enemies from the past join with new ones. Old friends come to help, but will it be enough to keep Alex alive?<br /><br />From the very beginning, SCORPIA RISING felt like the end. Horowitz pulls out a style that ends up being very final in every sense. The book is split into two sections -- Part 1: the buildup and Part 2: the payoff. Alex is definitely in over his head, and it was fun to see some of the interesting connections SCORPIA RISING has to previous installments in the ALEX RIDER series. And Horowitz does something that is insanely fun this time: he sends Jack Starbright and Smithers on the mission along with Alex. Jack has always been one of my favorite characters in the series, and she was fun to follow as she tries to help Alex. And having Smithers along was definitely a major highlight -- and not without a few surprises.<br /><br />Alex has grown up a little and the series has grown with him. The entire book had a very dark feel to it, reminiscent of book five: SCORPIA. The action scenes are really gritty as usual, and there is a bit of coarse language splattered in. Alex has to face real evil, far worse than many of the other villains of the past.<br /><br />This is a spoiler free review, but I must say that the only part I was slightly disappointed with was the very last page and the strange note that Horowitz leaves the book on. It didn't feel quite resolved in the end, although this is apparently the last time we will be seeing Alex Rider.<br /><br />I still have yet to find a Horowitz book I didn't like. He brings everything together -- excellent plotting, twists, characters, action -- to create something that truly transcends other YA fiction.ange note that Horowitz leaves the book on.

B004L49K20|5.0|I somewhat sheepishly admit I've always been a big Duran Duran fan, although it got me more than a little grief as a 15 year old but is suddenly cool now that I'm 40. Like everyone else I loved the first 2 albums, but thought \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" was uneven and rushed, and things just went downhill quickly after the solid if unspectacular \\"Notorious\\". But even during the down years I always found 1 or 2 songs that were truly great on every release. I wasn't fond of \\"Astronaut\\" but again a few great songs stood out. I'm one of the few who liked \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\", not because of the horribly misguided production/musical direction, but because the songs were tremendous. (\\"Falling Down\\" still stands as my favourite DD song ever.) So like everyone else when I heard all the press reports about AYNIN being a 'return to roots' album I was excited but cautious. After hearing it however I don't really agree with all that 'roots' hype. It's a tremendous album, by far their best since \\"Rio\\", but it's not a total retro album. I hear a lot of the best parts of all their previous efforts in this, but it still has that 80's vibe AND a modern vibe as well. Simon LeBon has never sounded better, John Taylor remains one of the best bassists alive, Nick Rhodes still creates layers of gorgeous melodies, and after RCM, it's nice to hear Roger Taylor play a real drum kit again because he's as good a drummer as there is. (DD have always been criminally underrated as musicians.) I love guitarist Dom Brown's addition to the band, he stood out among the studio concoction that was RCM, and his work here really elevates the already great songs to even higher levels. His riffs always compliment the songs, a welcome change from Andy Taylor's aggressive licks that always somehow seemed too much for the material. But it's the songs, performed by great musicians, and FINALLY executed properly through the whole album thanks to fan/producer Mark Ronson that make this album so great. The somewhat schizophrenic title track has a weird keyboard riff leading into chorus that won't get out of your head. \\"Leave a light on\\" is very reminiscent of \\"Save a Prayer\\" but with a modern vibe, and it's a truly beautiful song with a wonderful vocal performance by Simon. Did I mention he's gotten better with age? \\"The man who stole a Leopard\\" is mesmorizing, \\"Mediterranea\\" is really atmospheric much like \\"My Antarctica\\" from the \\"Liberty\\" album but far better musically and \\"Runway Runaway\\" is almost the perfect DD song, with a great Dom Brown guitar riff holding the bouncy, fun melody together. AYNIN is not the retro experience many would have you believe, but it is a welcome return to a great full ALBUM of well written, well performed, and for the first time in a long while, well produced and executed songs from a band who always knew how. They just needed a little help from a fan to get them back where they always should have been. Buy this album, it's enjoyable, it's a great listen, it's just plain great music from a great band.ewhat schizophrenic title track has a weird keyboard riff leading into chorus that won't get out of your head. \\"Leave a light on\\" is very reminiscent of \\"Save a Prayer\\" but with a modern vibe, and it's a truly beautiful song with a wonderful vocal performance by Simon.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Never gave angry birds a chance til the Amazon Android Market came about and I absolutely love it. I find the levels to be challenging enough that its still able to be fun. Visually its a beautiful game that works well with a small screen. Love it!
B0041KKYDI|4.0|Most of us have heard the story of Aron Ralston cutting off his own arm to survive, after getting it caught by a falling boulder in a narrow canyon. This is the draw of \\"127 Hours,\\" and of course it's the drawback, since we know the end of the story. I suppose that explains some reviewers' thoughts about this being a slow-moving film. If you know the end, you just want to get to that anticipated arm-cutting moment.<br /><br />It's a sad way to approach this film, really. The director takes great pains to be accurate to the original story, while keeping things moving with suspense, emotion, and heart. James Franco does a superb job of acting, allowing us into the excitement, shock, and slow mental breakdown that occurs while his character deals with solitude, pain, and nutritional deprivation. The cinematography is beautiful, the soundtrack a mix of eerie and majestic, and the screenplay stark yet effective.<br /><br />My wife, daughter, and I all enjoyed it--even if my sixteen-year-old closed her eyes during the \\"gross\\" part. While never quite as engaging as \\"Touching the Void,\\" another true-life survival story, this movie captures the well-known story, adds some details for us, and makes sure to voice a warning about the dangers of braving the elements with inflated self-assurance.
B0043GN6XK|5.0|Yes, yes I loved Vivaldi. Who doesn't, at least as his \\"Four Seasons\\" goes. But his operatic efforts were unknown to me. The orchestration and instrumentation in \\"Ercole\\" is thrilling, prompting me several times to rise up and fling my arms about as I \\"conducted\\" the score. The singing and disc sound are nothing less than stellar. But what won me over completely was the story. A group of Amazon-like women, powerful, beautiful, and throughly conditioned to fear and loathe men are ripe for the plucking when a group of the latter are deposited on their sanctuary's beach following a shipwreck. Fun, fun!
0811876373|5.0|I just love this book. It is so full of clever ideas for baking up and creating interesting little treats. I was very pleased with the hard cover and how nicely it was arranged, photo's and all. I may even purchase some more to use as gifts.
B002PJ4II4|3.0|This is a very interesting look into the personality and life of one of the most influential technological innovators of all time. Steve Wozniak has a huge ego, but it is commensurate with his achievements. Lincoln wasn't a modest man either, despite the mythology that has sprouted around his legacy.     Woz was a very bright child whose intellect was nurtured by his father, his teachers and his environment (Silicon Valley, HP, etc). He built a digital adding and subtracting machine using over 100 transistors as a science fair project as a child. I'm sure his dad helped him, but he built it and, more importantly, he designed it. It was crude, (the inputs were toggle switches and the output was a series of light bulbs) but it worked! While designing calculators for Hewlett-Packard in his day job, at night he continued designing and redesigning the logic for Atari games on paper. He kept refining the design to use the minimum number of logic elements. Woz's stories about Steve Jobs are also insightful: Woz contends that Jobs' shortchanged him on revenue received from Atari from Woz's work on simplifying game logic circuitry. Woz also says that Jobs quit Apple in 1984 and wasn't fired. He also talks about his failed marriages; his enrollment at Berkely under the alias \\"Rocky Racoon Clark\\" and the plane crash in 1981 that damaged his brain.     One of Woz's major achievements was designing the Apple 2 interface for a floppy disk drive (which in the mid 1970s was a brand new storage device). This was not straightforward and involved extremely complex and creative hardware and software design. He says he did all this in two weeks-- The Apple 2 was the only computer to have a floppy drive at the national computer exhibition in 1977. All the other computers used audio cassette tape drives--which were much slower--for storage!     Woz was also a prankster and the book details many of them, including his Dial-a-Polish-Joke line (Woz is Polish). He once called the Pope, claiming to be Henry Kissinger. (The Pope called HK and figured out that the call was a prank.) He also talks about how his mother got his picture with Richard Nixon in the San Jose Mercury News when RN was campeigning for governor of California in 1962.    Having said all that, this book has major problems. It is so colloquial--to the point of embarressment--that it is hard to beleive that it was written by an educated person and with a co-author to boot! He would helped his credability immensely if he would have cut the colloquialisms and given a little precise engineering description of some of his amazing projects. The way they are described, you'd never gain an appreciation as to their immense technological complexity.     In the final chapter, Woz advises people who want to create great thechnological things to work alone. I wonder if this isn't an indication of his inability to precisely communicate via the written word. Maybe it is the result of the result of the brain damage from his plane crash.  Again, you could scarcely beleive that a guy who designed all those amazing things would write like this. I would have hope that a co-author would have fixed this.    This is an interesting, breezy book that gives some important insights into the author, the computer revolution in general and Apple and Steve Jobs in particular. I just wish it was written better.

0312360258|4.0|In reading Marked, I kept wondering what Zoey's life was like before she got Marked.  The authors didn't really go much into detail about that--we just know that she has a step-father (or step-loser as she calls him).  Almost right at the beginning she gets Marked and her life drastically changes.  It is very fast paced and I found myself not being able to put it down (except to sleep).  Yes, this is not like \\"Twilight\\" which I found refreshing.  Not all vampire novels need to be the same.  I liked the creativity of this story.  Looking forward to reading the 2nd book \\"Betrayed\\".

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I can't really add much to the current \\"most helpful favorable\\" review of this CD (that review is titled \\"Beautiful\\"), so I will just refer you to that reviewer's comments.    I can say, however, that this is one of the most creative, beautiful examples of fine music that I've every heard, and Adele's voice and talent have reached new vibrant & powerful levels.     I have no doubt but that she will be increasingly recognized for her enormous vocal talents and lyrics.  No one is going to be disappointed by this CD!
0689865384|4.0|I am a big fan of books about futuristic societies, and I must say that this book definitely sparked my interest.  The world Westerfield created is so unique and interesting, and it really gets you thinking about the idea of beauty and the way things are today.  It also makes our society's current obsession with beauty seem frightening - like is this the world we could end up in because of what we value?  Slipped within the fun and amusing narrative is some great food for thought not only about beauty, but also about other issues such as environmental destruction and societies' dependence on natural resources.  Overall, Uglies is an enjoyable and easy read, and will definitely leave you excited for the next book in the series.
B004NSULHM|3.0|Ok, let me first preface this, by saying that I am the kind of Radiohead fan that thinks that their best work was OK Computer and that they started to decline after Kid A.  The decline really became steep after Hail to the Thief.  They just don't even attempt to rock anymore.  It is way to ambient/techno for me.  I mean, the album is not all bad, it is still Radiohead, so it has some genius in there.  Some moments are still really great, but overall it is just not how it used to be.  Tracks 5-8 are really standouts.  I just wish there was a little dark rock in there.  This is much too Eraser, which was good because it wasn't Radiohead, but now it is.  I mean I hear a lot of Can and Krautrock in there, and I guess that is where they are trying to go, but its just not to my taste.  I guess Thom is trying to do something like a late period John Coltrane or something, but it just isn't hitting, maybe he should think more about Bitches Brew era Davis instead.  Even better, focus on OK Computer era Radiohead.  I mean just get rocking again and the rest should take care of itself.  Drum loops that build are cool, but just not on every song. Maybe they will tire of this style, since this album almost has the feel of B-sides from In Rainbows, or even from Hail to Thief, because a lot of the sounds they introduced there are back.  This used to be a guitar band, but there is hardly any guitar featured here, what is there is good, but its just \\"in the mix\\" too often.  Don't expect great guitar solos.  In conclusion, this is an album Europeans will probably feel better about than Americans.  If you like Techno/Trance type stuff then you will like this, but if you loved the Bends and OK Computer and are waiting for this kind of album, just keep waiting.
0525423273|5.0|I. Loved. This. Book. LOVED IT!!  Which is funny, because I normally don't read contemporary books that often and I hate romance.  And this book was a contemporary romance.  Yet I fell in love with it!  It is freaking hilarious.  I love the author's humor, and I was laughing out loud over and over again.  I am so glad I wasn't reading this book in public because I would have gotten some looks.  I absolutely adored the characters - Etienne is hot and I wish he were mine, and Anna is so easy to relate to.  I don't feel like I read about these characters; I feel like I am actually friends with them.  I loved the charming Parisian setting and details; I felt like I was there in Paris.  The book is utterly believable, and it had me hooked from the first page.  I could not put it down!  I stayed up til three in the morning to finish it, and then I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about it!  This is a magical, funny, romantic novel and I would love to give it six stars instead of five.  Stephanie Perkins will be penning two more companion novels in the next year or so and I am very excited!
B0012NO316|5.0|This movie was so real, yet so unreal. It is full of surprises, but, for the real surprise you will have to wait till end! Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were so good, true actors! I would recommend this movie to everyone.
0439023521|5.0|For the longest time, I avoided reading this series because I had this feeling that I would become utterly obsessed.  I just knew that I would need to run out and buy all the books and spend every waking moment reading them.  Well, I finally gave in and read them, and this definitely happened.  This book was absolutely amazing and I could barely put it down.  I really accomplished nothing in the two days it took me to read this book.  The author, Suzanne Collins, has created a future dystopia that is not only utterly believable but utterly terrifying.  The world is fleshed out and solid, and there are hints all around that just beg to beg to be answered in the sequels.  This book would even do well as a stand alone, but once I finished the book, I hungered for more of the characters and a deeper look at the nation of Panem.  Looking at the characters, Katniss is a wonderful main character.  She is likable, strong, and has legitimate motivations for her actions and feelings.  While we meet some flat characters in the games, there are so many other characters whom you can easily connect with and are (futilely) rooting for that it doesn't even matter.  In fact, some of those characters should stay flat, I think.  It's funny how hard it is to review a book you are jumping for joy over.  I really can't say anything other than you must read it, it is that good.

1595141715|1.0|I am one of the rare minority who did not enjoy this book.  In fact, I was completely annoyed with it.  I struggled through it and kept rolling my eyes.  It took a lot to make myself finish it. I hoped it would get much better, since there is so much positive hype surrounding this book, but unfortunately it did not.  I am also going to preface my negative comments by saying that I am not at all mean-spirited, heartless, or think lightly of suicide. I also have been at the receiving end of some terrible things in high school so I do know what that feels like, and so I am not approaching this as simply someone who didn't experience bad things in high school.  Suicide is an extremely serious issue, and I think it is extremely important to be explored in books, especially considering the epidemic of teen suicides we have been facing lately. However, I felt like this book did not give it the respect and seriousness it deserves. I loved the concept of this story, and I think a story like this has the potential to be amazing and powerful. Perhaps if it was tackled by a different author or had different characters, maybe I would have thought it was.<br /><br />I did enjoyed the dual narration format of the book. This was a very interesting and engaging format to choose. However, it did get a little bit confusing for me with the back and forth, not only because it switched from character to character as well as from present to flashback.  This might have been because I was not 100% engaged with the book since I did not enjoy it, and so I bet I got a bit sloppy in my reading habits. I also applaud the creativity of the book, because it is such an usual and unique premise. The writing also is engaging, flows well, and is never boring.<br /><br />My main problem was the characters. While I thought Clay was a very realistic character, and the emotions he went through while listening to Hannah's tapes where very realistic and appropriate, I did not like Hannah. I thought Hannah's voice seemed whiny and annoying. I felt as if she was being a spiteful, vindictive little child in talking to the people listening to the tapes, rather than seriously wanting people to know how their actions affected her. She was laughing and sounded humorous when I feel like she should have sounded somber and depressed. Her actions pointed to somber and depressed, yet her voice came away the exact opposite. This sounds terrible, but my impression of her voice was like \\"Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah! I killed myself and now you have to feel bad!\\" That is not at all what I wanted to come away with from this character. With her voice being this way, I could not sympathize with her. I tried and tried, but I just couldn't.<br /><br />I am also annoyed with the reasons Hannah gave for her suicide. Some of them seemed so minute to me! Yes it's true, these things seem less terrible now as an adult removed from high school, and when they happen they seem like the end of the world, but I feel like the author could have chosen more substantial reasons or made them more significant. I won't go into the reasons, so this will be spoiler free.. but the reasons are all so little and silly, like an embarrassing thing or annoying thing that happened.  What Hannah experienced seemed to be the norm for high school, and not valid enough reasons for her to want to kill herself. Now, I know that this book is supposed to show how small little actions have big ramifications, and I'm not trying to say that anyone should be made fun of for their reasons that push them to suicide... just that it didn't seem realistic. It annoyed me was too ridiculous for me.  Perhaps Hannah sounded so ridiculous to me because she was written by a male author who maybe doesn't get girls and what they sound like and how they feel. I feel like this was more thirteen reasons why of a twelve year old, not an older high schooler.  I also realize that Hannah did give up on life halfway or three-quarters of the way through her reasons, but what she did from then on really angered me. She then began to actively seek out terrible situations and place her self in them on purpose, and then yet saying wish it wouldn't have happened or that people would have stopped it.  It was really aggravating.<br /><br />I feel really bad reviewing this book so harshly. I think if it was a normal fluffy book about an insignificant topic, I wouldn't have felt bad. But I feel bad because of the sensitive nature of the topic. But, I guess you can't change your impression of a book so no use feeling bad about it.t she did from then on really angered me.

B002QQ8HAG|3.0|Anna Wintour has been Vogue's editor for over 20 years. In her signature blond bob (she has had the same haircut for decades), Anna chooses everything that goes into Vogue, the bible of the fashion world.  No decisions are made without her approval.    Glenn Close's character in The Devil Wears Prada was rumoured to be modelled after Anna.    Known for her cold persona and followed by fashionistas all over the world, Anna has a cult-like following. But who is she? Why is she so interested in fashion? Is she as cold-hearted as she appears when sitting in the front row of fashion shows? Is there more to Vogue than just clothes?    The documetary tries to answer some of those questions by filming the making of Vogue's September Issue. This is the largest issue of Vogue every year and can number over 500 pages in some years. It sets the fashion trends for the new season.    The documentary includes interviews with Anna talking about how she became a fashion editor. Her father was a respected writer for a British newspaper and was the one who told her she was going to be the editor of Vogue.    It also shows how it takes a small army of dedicated staff to put together what goes inside the September issue. These include interns, stylists, photographers, and designers etc.     The most interesting scenes are the ones between Anna and Grace Coddington, the lead stylist at Vogue. They started working at Vogue at the the same time and they both grew up in Great Britain during the Swinging Sixties.    There are numerous conflicts between Anna and Grace as they disagree over what should be placed in the magazine. Grace has her own ideas about what makes a good photo which often conflict with Anna's opinions. Anna keeps over-ruling the photos  that Grace loves. Too bad we don't see more arguments between them in this film.    The documentary also shows how involved Anna is in supporting young fashion designers like Thakoon who was the recipient of the CFDA grant.  Anna is portrayed as very supportive of this young upcoming designer as she visits his studio and gets him a deal with GAP to design a line of white shirts. She actually seems kind of nice.    Of course, there are scenes of Anna at home with her daughter (what happened to the husband? We never see him at all. He is not even mentioned.) There are the usual expected scenes of Anna attending fashion shows, various Vogue-sponsored events, and meetings.     The dvd bonus contains several short documentaries on some of the major players on Vogue's staff. The one about Grace Coddington and how her personal photography collection at home have influenced her work at Vogue was the most interesting one.     Do we learn more about Anna? Yes, but just barely. The documentary never really went deep enough for the viewer to understand her.  The film makes an attempt to make her seem more human than some aloof cult fashion dicatator, but the documentary never really gets under her skin.     Do we appreciate the huge number of staff and editors who put together this monthly fashion mag? Yes. It looks like hard work.     But in the end, it's really just fashion. It shouldn't be taken too seriously.    So unless you are avid Vogue reader and Anna follower, don't buy this dvd.
0439023491|5.0|This was a great continuation of the series.  It is just as action packed and fast paced as the first, and once again it kept me enthralled and on the edge of my seat.  I was completely unprepared for the big surprise punishment that Katniss is sucked into halfway through the book.  I should have seen it coming, but I was just so engrossed that it hit me like a ton of bricks.  I think that was an awesome move for the series.  Throughout that part of the story, it was so exciting to see the other characters act out of character - I totally saw that something bigger was going on, and it killed me that Katniss didn't recognize it!  Wow, it is seriously hard to review this book without giving away an of its secrets!  Just basically know, that if you loved the first book, you will love this exciting sequel.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|I ordered these in green.  I was somewhat concerned about what color green they'd actually be but the photo on Amazon does them justice - medium to dark olive.  They are true to length.  The straps are long enough to accommodate wide feet.  The foot bed and straps are nice and soft.
0439023513|4.0|The final book in The Hunger Games series left me heartbroken, angry, and haunted.  Even though other reviewers said that Mockingjay did not have a happy ending or that it was not wrapped up nicely with a little bow, I still was clinging to the hope of one.  I wanted a happy ending, and I wanted all the ends tied up neatly. They were right - we do not get that.  I also had certain expectations about the characters.  I wanted Katniss to remain strong and untouched by all she had been through.  I wanted her to choose love at the end, and not just pick what seemed to be the only option left.  Most of all, I wanted her to move on, and live life like a normal person like at the end, not just be a miserable shell of what she once was, used up and spit out.  And the book didn't give me any of that. It left me feeling probably a bit how Katniss felt.  But I think a lot of that is simply because such a terrible life of hardship and suffering could not lead to a happy ending.  The book accomplished its purpose - to show how war, and death, and suffering impacts people.  It does not leave people happy and content and strong, but rather leaves them picking up the pieces of their broken bodies, broken homes, and broken lives.  It leaves them trying to put together what they can rebuild from the ashes,which is exactly how the series ended for Katniss.  I loved this book, and yet I did not love it.  I felt cheated and hollow after reading it, but I know that is exactly what made this book so powerful.<br /><br />That being said, I honestly was torn between rating it four and five stars.  Yes, I loved both the book and the series as a whole, and I think the direction the book went in was completely appropriate and true to life, but I found several problems nagging at me that I did not have with the other books.  For one, several characters died quite suddenly, and I felt as if they did not receive proper homage or even adequate 'screen time' if you will beforehand. Their deaths seemed to come out of nowhere, and we hadn't heard from these characters in a while so it didn't really matter or impact me all that much.  On the other hand, some characters died that I did care about, and their deaths were pretty much glazed over.  I also noticed that this book lacked the balance and warmth brought by Peeta in the other books, and that the usually strong Katniss was almost constantly wallowing in self-pity and allowed herself to be used as a pawn time and time again.  And also, I am still wishing it the book had gone in a different direction.  What I got was not at all what I expected from the final book.  Those things bothered me while I read and after, but looking at the larger scheme of things, this was a fitting ending to a dark and depressing series.  I am sad to see the series, and Katniss and Peeta and Gale, go.ome out of nowhere, and we hadn't heard from these characters in a while so it didn't really matter or impact me all that much.

B003VANOFY|2.0|BUYERS BEWARE:  The product will most likely be faulty. Your health might even suffer from engaging in extensive research for nonexistent solutions. Although Logitech has fixed some problems regarding the memory leaks and cutoffs through drivers, the product still presents a lackluster sound quality with all the crackling sounds. I am in a great position to say that the 4 and 5 star ratings are premature compliments that preceded the onset of this excessive and unacceptable crackling. I do not blame these reviewers; I would have initially given the g930 a 5 star rating as well. However - after a week - the crackling set in and I was one in a few hundred who have experience the same dissatisfaction. This is my fault for disregarding the power of reviews, overlooking these consumers as recipients faulty products.    If you find yourself experiencing the same problems, please do hesitate in blaming your retailer. Chances are, it is Logitech to blame for not backing up this product with the service it was once reputable for.    One last thing: the 7.1 will make you feel like you are sitting in a cave. The only sounds surrounding the listener are echoes.
B003Q6D25K|2.0|I totally disagree with the Amazon reviewer, who of course has to praise the film lavishly so that people buy the DVD. The truth is, very little happens during the first 75 minutes of the film, and the final 15 minutes are disappointing.  The problem here is two-fold.  First, the repetition - night after night of nothing happening gets boring fast.  Secondly, there are hardly any scares in the film (pool cleaners exiting the pool are not scary; neither are falling pots, closing doors or crying babies) and what few scares there are rely on cheap loud noises to startle the audience. I didn't like the first film, but at least its scares were well-earned.  For example, there is nothing here as remotely creepy as PA1's images of the girl hovering over her boyfriend for hours or the paw prints in the baby powder.  To make matters worse, there are some ridiculous things about this film such as the family not moving out once they saw the footage of the mom being dragged by an invisible presence.  What??!!  Any sane person would have left the house immediately.  This should have been much better.  I'm not a movie director, but I'm confident that if I had the same budget to work with I could make a much scarier movie.

0143116738|4.0|\\"The Element\\" is a great read with many thought-provoking personal stories and insights into what it means to be creative as well as observations about how this relates to the current state of the US educational system.  Ken Robinson achieved a significant amount of attention for his TED talks on creativity and education and this book makes an excellent companion piece to provide details around his points of view.  For those in the education field or looking to change their views on creativity, it's a must read.    The book has several short comings, primarily around your expectations about what you'll get out of it.  I would estimate that a full third of the book is comprised of stories of successful individuals \\"in their element.\\" While it is interesting to know how successful people reached their potential, at some point citing examples over and over again serves to demoralize the reader and beat a point to death. Secondly and in my mind, most critically of Ken Robinson, he makes many insightful observations but always stops short of making a recommendation about what to try or what to change. This book is not a \\"how to\\" manual.  Still, the book is very enjoyable for what it is.

B003L20ICE|1.0|This started out as a warm, funny film about an unconventional family. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules, the two Moms. They have raised a daughter, Joni (after Joni Mitchell) and a son, Laser (after the sailing dinghy?) whom they each conceived with sperm from the same donor, making the kids biological half-siblings.<br /><br />Joni is eighteen and college-bound. Laser is fifteen, and getting into trouble with his troubled friend Clay, who uses the word \\"faggot\\" too much, mildly physically abuses him, and knows no boundaries(in one scene he appropriates Nic and Jules' battery-operated boyfriend).<br /><br />Out of curiosity (and in Laser's case in need of an older male role model) the kids seek out their biological father Paul (Mark Ruffalo). The unattached Paul is a bit of a free spirit who owns an organic restaurant. Although he is at first bemused by the fact of having children, he is soon an enthusiastic participant in Laser's and Joni's lives.<br /><br />Nic reacts badly. She is the breadwinner, the disciplinarian, and a bit of a control freak who immediately objects to Paul. When nobody pays her any mind, she becomes ill-tempered and begins drinking heavily.<br /><br />Jules is the stay-at-home partner, more passive and more pliant. As Nic withdraws and becomes ever more disagreeable, Jules seduces Paul.<br /><br />For his part, Paul is thrilled to be part of the family, and begins to build castles in the air around his relationship with Jules and the children.<br /><br />Up until this point (about 5/6ths of the movie) this is a good-natured story of an atypical family facing a complex relationship issue. The last sixth of the movie melts down to slag, costing it at least three stars, because THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT suddenly transforms into a hideous anti-male, gay-bashing diatribe.<br /><br />The affair comes out. Although Jules instigated it and admits to doing so, Paul is utterly demonized. She is not. Jules breaks off the affair (\\"I'm gay. Damn you.\\"), and Nic calls him a \\"F*****g interloper.\\" The kids (particularly Laser) reject him outright. \\"I thought you'd be better,\\" Joni sneers.<br /><br />It was at about this point that I seriously considered shattering this DVD with a hammer. The utter callousness and cruelty of Joni, Laser, Nic and Jules toward Paul is truly nauseating. Not one of these self-absorbed Hollywood standard-issue Yuppie characters ever considers for a single moment that it is THEY who have brought Paul into their lives. Neither Nic nor Jules has the depth or honesty to understand that they have both manipulated and used Paul to work out underlying and long-standing issues in their own relationship. The dour Laser, in rejecting this caring male figure, probably dooms himself to forming attachments with troublesome and abusive males like Clay who will dominate him for years to come. Joni escapes the nest. The \\"happy ending\\" of this vindictive film consists of Nic and Jules rebonding. Paul has vanished, broken.<br /><br />This film was obviously written by a male-bashing, self-hating woman who chooses to portray all lesbians as stereotypically dysfunctional man-haters and all men as garbage.<br /><br />The film's homophobia is manifest in that the women are controlling, manipulative, dishonest, insensitive and abusing without a scintilla of self-awareness.<br /><br />In retrospect, this movie's unbending hatred of men is evident at the outset (what parent names their son \\"Laser\\"?). Male behavior is seen as destructive and irresponsible and weak (Paul, the \\"sperm donor,\\" has no family; Clay urinates on a dog's head at one point; Jules fires the gardener, the only eyewitness to her infidelity, for no real reason at all in some twisted act of expiation and he slinks off without a single word). In short, this \\"warm family comedy-drama\\" turns into a jeremiad against those of us who are so-called cursed with testosterone. Frankly, for me it's a blessing. I'd rather be Paul than be any of the four vicious losers in this film.<br /><br />This vile film was a big hit at Sundance, a Golden Globe winner, and an Academy Award nominee, I have to believe largely because of its oh-so Politically Correct portrayal of a married gay family. I will credit Bening, Moore Ruffalo and the kids with some splendid acting. Ruffalo in particular, deserves a combat medal for surviving this role psychologically intact. Obviously, the critics chose to overlook the unrelieved darkness and negativity that drips like poison from this film.<br /><br />Once again, cruelty passes for entertainment in the 2010s. Forget it.ce, a Golden Globe winner, and an Academy Award nominee, I have to believe largely because of its oh-so Politically Correct portrayal of a married gay family.

B002ZG976U|5.0|I usually  don't do movie reviews. I heard this wasn't great. I love Cher and wanted to see it. Cher in concert is once in a lifetime thing. but you don't know that till you see her. I always thought she was good but not a great gifted artist, I was wrong. Now the movie...<br /><br />This movie is dramatic, exciting, happy, sad, wonderful. I watched it without my husband home thinking he wouldn't be interested, was I wrong. he will love this and I can't wait for him to get home and watch it with me.<br />Great movie, watch it. Any critics that didn't like it have no concept of true artistic style and the meaning of burlesque, it's style. It is nughty, sexy, never dirty. Erotic. This is all of that but since it is naughty, parents watch before to see if your young ones should watch. It is a true PG 13.  Politics could only be involved giving this anything but a great review.<br />I really feel that not enough people who have seen and liked this , reviewed it. So here is mine.

B004KA9MQO|2.0|i think Jennifer Hudson is a good artist who with the right material has a chance at being a triple threat, however right now Broadway and showtunes seems to be her destiny. somewhere between being a modern Melba Moore Meets Fantasia,Leslie Uggams type of career.  the lead single by Where you at written and Produced by R.Kelly is a standard song for adult comtempary radio which follows what he submitted for WHitney Houston nice middle of the road track, however since they are both from the CHI Southside I would love to hear J Hud get a few of kellz Steppers tracks or a Hood Opera track along the lines of what he did with sparkle and especially what he did with Kelly Price and in truth if this Project was to highlight J Hud Properly she would have been given that good stuff that Kelly Price had because that is whom J Hud reminds me of amongest a few others.<br /><br />the rest of the tracks are alright though they are looped based and jack a few known tracks which feels like a part 2 of Idol. J Hud is a entertainer that does a bit of all,however she could really have the music thing down pat with stronger material to match her vocals. and on a Side note I dug her thicker, i ain't feeling no Jenny Craig Commericals I'd rather see her doing the I Hop Commericals because she is Beautiful period naturally and I pull for the Soul Sister for all she has been through. i just hope she gets the kind of album that brings out the full goods.<br /><br />these first two albums have been cute at best, but there hasn't been much bite to match her range and she deserves that.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|This is a beautifully done movie. I recongized Jungian and archetypal themes from the start, which is appropriate given that Swan Lake is based upon a fairy tale, which in and of itself is archetypal. The lead character, Nina, is an extreme example of the psyche which is not fully integrated. \\"Lily\\" represents her shadow, the part of herself that is lustful and uninhibited,and ambitious. The film exploits this in obvious ways: Lilly is always in dark clothing, Nina in white, and Nina often sees her own face when she sees Lilly. \\"Thomas\\" is her animus, awakening her to the greater talent within herself, trying to help her reach full potential, forcing her to face the dark forces within herself. This film explores every inch of the psyche, the good, the bad, the lustful, the innocent, the greedy, the vulnerable. I will no doubt be watching it again and again.
0316098337|5.0|I've been stuck in the world of memoirs for about 5 years now and decided to try a novel once again. I am so glad that I did. The way Emma channels the mind of a 5 year old boy was astounding. That's just the topping on the cake. There was no point in this story line that I wasn't hooked in. I am looking forward to reading more of her books! She paints a vivid picture for you; so much that you feel empathy for the characters. I would recommend this book (and have) to anyone!

0316172324|3.0|The book was a good quick read. He has an easy writing style, but tended to dwell on points a bit too long for my tastes.     In general he sought to discuss the power of thin-slicing situations. He successfully showed how its something everyone does subconsciously; sometimes to our advantage otherwise not as much. He includes a plethora of examples when \\"first impressions\\" save us misery, give us superior insight but contrasts them with examples of the opposite. He had also set out, according to his introduction, to discuss how to hone one's \\"thin slicing\\" ability, but here he fell short. The book had a very abrupt ending.
0385341008|5.0|For a rather hefty title, I felt this book had a lot to live up to.  I sort of feel as if I am the only person on the planet who has yet to read this book. A lot of people I know have been praising this novel and it has been recommended to me countless times.  I am so very glad that I got a copy and found out for myself what everyone has been already saying. The book is written through letters between Juliet Ashton and the residents of the small British Island, Guernsey that was once occupied by the Nazis during World War II.  Juliet is trying to figure out what her next novel is going to be about when she receives a letter from a Guernsey native who owns a book she gave away a long time ago.  This letter leads Juliet to meet and correspond with countless other residents of Guernsey and takes her on a journey of hope, survival, strength and love.<br /><br />I did really adore this book, I found it wonderful and endearing.  The letters taught me a lot about what it was like to live under German occupation during World War II and it also demonstrated that human beings can really survive a lot and all of the trial and tribulations we have to endure lead us to become stronger.  I was a bit hesitant at first since this book is told through letters and I wasn't sure if the authors were going to be able to develop every character, but I was wrong about this because through each letter we are able to gather descriptions and personality traits about all of the residents of Guernsey.  I can't imagine the book being written in any other way.  There is nothing very deep in this book but its message is a rather large one.  I enjoyed reading every sentence and line and I was saddened when I read the final letter because I felt as if the residents of Guernsey had become my friends as well.

1400052173|5.0|If you've ever wondered how far a doctor, a corporation or a university will go in the \\"name of science\\", you have to read this book. You really will stop and think.  The author had an extremely personable writing style that lets you take in a lot of medical and scientific data in a very understandable way. I will be thoroughly reading the fine print on medical consent forms from now on. You heart will go out to the family of Henrietta Lacks ... and you must be forever grateful for her contribution to the very health and medical rights we enjoy today.
0920668372|5.0|This book would be a GREAT Mother's Day gift from a \\"grown up baby\\" to her mama. :) I got this book based on the reviews. I struggled to finish reading it to my two year-old daughter today because I was choking back sobs. It's beautiful! I didn't find it humorous so much as I found it just touching and lovely. It speaks to the love and the strong connection between a mother and child that never, ever fades even with age and distance. Before I became a mother, I had no idea what this kind of love felt like nor could I have ever imagine it. You have to live it to know it. If you have lived it this book will honor that feeling in the best of ways. The price is unbeatable too!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I'm not crazy about the vampire genre - or sci fi in general... I had no intentions of watching this show. But the pilot was available for free on itunes - I was bored - decided to watch it. The first few episodes of this season are kind of blah - but that's with any show - the characters are still being developed. By the middle of this season I was hooked and I'm still hooked. All the characters are very likable in their own ways, even \\"the bad guys\\". I read a few of the books too - and the show is different enough where you can read the books AND watch the show and still be surprised by both. There are so many story lines going on at once... and it is not just your typical \\"teenager and vampire fall in love\\" crap. I'm 21 and I still love this show. Even my fiance doesn't hate it, ahha.<br /><br />I'd really recommend watching this show if you're thinking about it. It's really good. So glad to have finally found a currently running show that I've been watching from the beginning so I can be excited for weekly episodes. Haven't had a show like that in a long time! Season two has been AMAZING so far.

1439102724|2.0|Now I remember why I don't like Jodi Picoult.  So much drivel, boring, mundane and who cares? type of stuff in this novel.  A real writer and editor would move on to serious fiction and leave this elementary stuff behind.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|First off, if you're a Harry Potter fan like me, you have to watch this movie.  But be prepared it falls way short of any of the movies in the series.    If I had not read the books I would have been completely lost trying to keep up with the story.  I walked away from the movie really wanting to like it because there are some great scenes.  But again, they always seemed to make you say \\" Okay, that's it.\\" That was how I felt about the entire movie \\" That's it.\\"      I really hope the last two films make us forget about this one.  Still, you need to see the movie because it is J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter, and it is some of the best scifi ever.  Me and my family love the Harry Potter series and would highly recommend them.
030745455X|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is an amazing sequel to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and will leave you running to find a copy of the third book in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I have not been a fan of thrillers in the past, but this series has me clamoring for more of the extremely engaging characters Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. Their fight this time is against the sex trade, societal discrimination against women, and corruption in the highest levels of the Swedish government.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played With Fire stands separately from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but the story here is really \\"Part 1\\" of a story concluded in the third book. Larsson's work is brilliant. His Millennium Trilogy has almost singlehandedly given rise to the \\"Nordic Noir\\" genera. The great tragedy of Larsson's death has left his readers scrambling to find other Scandinavian novelists to fill the void. If you have not yet picked up these books, though, I truly envy you.  An amazing thrill ride awaits.<br /><br />One note to readers. Stieg Larsson's writing style has him \\"settle into\\" his characters a bit. As a reader you must trust the novelist to make the time you spend with them pay off in the end. Rest assured that Larsson every bit lives up to his reputation as a master, and if you give it the time The Girl Who Played With Fire will leave you breathless, white-knuckled, and online ordering the final book in the series when you finish reading it at 3am.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|WARNING: This Series Is Extremely Addictive (Spoiler FREE Review)    This series truly has a perfect balance. The drama, both crime and family, is portrayed excellently. There is a nice blend of dark and light humor. The action and tension keeps you addicted and craving more. Then there are equal parts of character development and exploration that add a nice depth to the mix. Add all those elements together and they have found the perfect formula for this series. It really earns it's reputation as one of television's greatest series (filling a specific void that has been lingering since series like The Sopranos, The Shield and The Wire left our screens). This season is great and Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul show how they earned their respective 2010 Best Lead/Supporting Actor Emmy Awards. Their pairing and subsequent chemistry are what binds this series together.       The third season consists of the following thirteen episodes, three of which were censored during original air and are found uncensored here:    1 No Mas   2 Caballo Sin Nombre  3 I.F.T. (*Uncensored Version)  4 Green Light  5 Mas (*Uncensored Version)  6 Sunset  7 One Minute  8 I See You  9 Kafkaesque  10 Fly (*Uncensored Version)  11 Abiquiu  12 Half Measures  13 Full Measures    This season is amazingly crafted. It begins by picking up where last season's cliffhanger left off. Walt is dealing with some guilt and Jesse has demons of his own to overcome. From there it is a slow burn for a few episodes as things are put in place for the middle of the season. Around episodes 6, 7 and 8 things kick into a high gear that finds the series being magnificently entertaining. After that the series does some character exploration and storytelling as it all starts coming together for another season finale cliffhanger where everything comes down to the last minute. Those who've seen it know it is a wonderfully structured season and those who haven't seen it yet are in for a treat.        Special Features:    -Cast & Crew Commentaries on 9 Episodes (By Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks and more)  -5 Behind-the-scenes Featurettes: Hit and Run, The Music of Breaking Bad, White Heat: Cranston on Fire, Pizza of Destiny: Cranston's Greatest Shot, Silent But Deadly: The Brothers Moncada  -Outtakes  -Deleted Scenes and Unused Footage  -Team S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Featurette  -AMC News Visits the Breaking Bad Writer's Room  -Mini Video Podcasts for every episode with Cast and Crew  -Inside Breaking Bad: 20 episodes that give a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create an episode    Exclusive to the Blu-ray (DVD buyers aren't missing much)  -Cast and Crew Photo Collection    The Breaking Bad season sets have always had a nice amount of features on them. While I love Mad Men and those sets reveal a lot of information in their commentaries they are nowhere near the Breaking Bad sets when it comes to behind-the-scenes. This Breaking Bad set not only has commentaries but like the first two sets it has a lot of supplemental material that gives viewers a real look into the making of the series. The Breaking Bad sets are, in my opinion, the best television series sets you can buy for your money.    The other thing about Breaking Bad is that it has it's own unique niche. There are other great series on television, arguably Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire among others, but Breaking Bad has something all its own. It doesn't have a period setting, it doesn't have any supernatural elements such as vampires or zombies, it is set in a modern day reality. While those other things are fun, Breaking Bad is a refreshing series that doesn't have to pay service to anything other than its story. This means that it is always attemping to tell its story in unique and interesting ways. They are always trying to break new ground and push the envelope in every way. The directing, the music selection, the writing/storytelling, every single element of this series tries to do something new or original and it is quite apparent when watching any of the episodes.    I should note I own the first two seasons on Blu-ray and they look great, but I've also seen them on DVD and they still look pretty darn good, so DVD buyer's won't be missing much (not even in regards to features). That said I'll definitely being going all in for the third time and getting the 3-disc Blu-ray. I've been having withdrawal symptoms since the last season ended, I can't wait to buy this and get psyched up for season 4!!! (Airing July 11th, and let's hope there are no more push backs!)
0811870413|5.0|This is a beautifully written, very detailed book. If you are new to baking it will take some patience and plenty of time to follow the detailed instructions and guidance...but the results are really, really worth it. The bread has beautiful texture and amazing taste. It is quite amazing the results you can get at home without specialty bakery tools and oven. I have also tried the Nettle Pizza and French Onion Soup from the book - both also outstanding.

0439023483|5.0|I just got done reading this tonight, and I just bought it two days ago! I am also not a \\"young adult\\". I loved this book. If you want something you can read in short bursts, and put down to get something done, this isn't the book. I neglected school work, exercise, housework, even the internet because I could not put this book down! It's fast paced, and written in the present tense, which I think adds to its urgency. Someone said it was \\"too violent\\". I disagree. Any violence in this book is portrayed as something bad, something unavoidable because of the situation they have been put into. Can't wait to read the next one and see what happens next! Even though someone on here already posted their thoughts on the ending of the final book and have ruined things a bit for me...Just a heads up, it's the review stating this is too violent. If you want to review the other two books, DO IT ON THE APPROPRIATE PRODUCT PAGE.     Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Harry Potter, The Gemma Doyle Trilogy, Twilight, etc.

B000FC12SM|3.0|If you're looking for a book that helps to decode some of the mysteries that separate women from men, this book is a great start.  It's not really what I would call an \\"intellectual book,\\" but a lot of the advice is good and very understandable.  A very easy read, and I enjoyed it.  The author does seem a little full of himself, but if you ignore that, a lot of the advice is solid.  I don't know how easy it would be to implement versus read, but it'll definitely be an interesting experiment!  So, I'd give the content four stars.    The formatting for Kindle gets one star.  Whoever formatted the book for Kindle did a HORRIBLE job.  Most (if not all the \\"charts\\") are cut off and illegible.  Since these charts are supposed to be helpful and practical examples that one can use in real life, this cuts out a good chunk of the useful advise offered by the author.  Changing the direction of the text, and font sizes does not help.  It almost made me want to get my money back.

B003FSTN7A|2.0|As reported by others the picture quality is not the best.    Checking disc 1 on my computer it is only a single layer 4.7Gb disc and as they are packing four episodes on a disc this explains the poor picture quality.    Can others please check your copies in a computer as perhaps pirate copies are in circulation as I would expect CBS not to cut such corners and use dual layer 9Gb DVD's.

1433524708|5.0|I started looking into the ESV Bibles last year and decided I really liked the study Bible.  However, I didn't really like the BIG size of the study Bible.  I looked around online and discovered that the personal size was going to be released this year, so I waited to see what it was like.  I'm so glad I waited.  It has all the great helps - fantastic notes, color illustrations, etc - but it's not so big as to discourage me from carrying it with me.  It does not have the words of Christ in red, but that does not bother me as it might some.
B002N4PB9G|5.0|I have collected all of BSB's CD's and DVD's heard and watched them all. I love them all but I must say that this one really got to me. The songs are so beautiful to me especially \\"Shattered, Siberia and Undone\\" these three songs are stuck in my head. BSB's has come a mighty long way with their unique sound and without Kevin being with them they still sound the same. To me Aj is the heart of the group as far as voices is concern because of his raspy vocals no one else in the group has that an Howie has that soft sensual voice that I also love, I really would love to hear more of him in their future albums. Then there is Brian and Nick with their upbeat tempo, when you bring all four voices together you create something so wonderful. I would definitely recommend this cd as well as the  others because you can most definitely tell that they are not boys anymore.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|One of the few truly beautiful things in life is having the ability to stand at the portal to someone's inner self and listen. Its like standing at the threshold to their soul and peeking in, listening to what their heart is saying. It is raw sometimes, and emotional, and sometimes it is so beautiful it hurts. It is also hard to not attach your own feelings to it when you, yourself, are needy because something truly desciptive bounds from place to place without effort. Music seems to be the easiest way to manipulate this.<br /><br />With Sia, I feel like that. I like the description that says that listening sometimes almost feels rude because of what you hear, but you really cannot stop listening. There's just something inside of it that says Hello in such a beautiful way. Colour the Small One really does that to me, too, with specific sounds. Breathe Me has grown here like something old and beautiful, with vocals and that little piece of piano making me hurt a little and feel a little and, afterwards, find myself - happier. Moon has this soft little beat that calls out in a loving way, a minimal beat echoing from nothing and yet having so much volume. Sonday, though easily constructed and rudimentary in some levels, has a little smile in it for me and has a day in it for everyone.<br /><br />And the list goes on and on.<br /><br />I know a llot of people push music but there are samples for you if you need convincing. There is a 5/5 here, however, and I hope you can find it as well.<br /><br />Thank you.
0307593495|5.0|In 2008 Sweden at Hakan von Enke's seventy fifth birthday party the disturbed former Swedish naval commander tells Kurt Wallander about a 1980 incident he was involved in.  His crew found an unidentified submarine in Swedish territorial waters, but when he reported it to his superiors while preparing to force the sub to surface, he was told to back away.<br /><br />Soon after the septuagenarian tells his tale, he and his wife vanish. Although suffering from diabetes and memory lapses, and euphoric over the birth of his grandchild, sexagenarian Ystad Police Detective Wallander investigates what happened in the last few days to the parents of his daughter's mate and back during the height of the Cold War.<br /><br />Wallander is at his crusty best with a case that goes nowhere and with age aches reminding him of his mortality as he fears death making him The Troubled Man; as ironically also is von Enke over the 1980 incident.  The mystery is top rate as always in this super Swedish police procedural as the hero sees his detecting days nearly over with the family torch going to his police officer daughter.  However, he refuses to quit on an inquiry involving his future in-laws as the Cold War echoes two decades after it ended in wintry cold Sweden.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B0045U9WPU|5.0|I just finished Delerium 5 minutes ago and as my title says, Oh. My. God! It was amazing. I must admit it took me awhile to get into it, there wasn't much action and I didn't know where the story was going. I guess it was about 100 pages in (not totally positive because I read It on my kindle) that it just took off and didn't stop. The two main characters, Lena and Alex, were great together. Probably one of my favorite literary couples ever. I'm going to say anything about the plot because I wouldn't want to ruin the suspense that I felt for anyone.   The only thing I can say is don't give up on Delerium if you find the beginning a little slow like I did, the pay off is too great.
B001US29I2|5.0|My nephews (8) not only requested this, they researched it online for the best deal and begged me to opt for the fastest shipping(did not need to, it came very quickly). They could not even wait for my sister to take a pic before they opened it and started playing. Needless to say, it remains to be a huge hit!
0316066524|5.0|I loved this. Close to life changing experience. Not like anything I've read (before or since). Requires concentration to have a chance of following the plot (plots). This guy's genius is evident and it's pathetic he ended his life... and so early. One has to make a committment to get through this story, even without reading most of the footnotes. Yes, I did say footnotes. A writer like this comes along once in a lifetime... if you're lucky. I'll read it again, and that's the best praise I can give this book.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|Britney Spears is pretty much the poster child for record-label-fabricated pop music, and Femme Fatale does little to change that.  The catch here is this, however...Femme Fatale is one heck of an enjoyable dance record!  In terms of how the album sounds, this seems like the true follow up to the sensational Blackout album (I always felt Circus, while good, was a step back for Brit).  The songs are meticulously produced...almost to the point of being over-produced.  There's hardly a track on the entire record (including the four bonus tracks in the deluxe edition) where Britney's voice isn't heavily altered.  But still, there's no track that could be considered a ballad, so the autotune works well for effect, for the most part.  The #1 single off the album, \\"Hold It Against Me\\" and its follow-up \\"Till The World Ends\\" pretty much showcase what you're getting.    Lyrically, the album is pretty simple.  Britney Spears didn't write a single song on this record, though I doubt that if she did the lyrics would be any better.  But the point of this album is to get you on the dance floor, and in that aspect it succeeds in spades.  Songs like the first two singles, the brilliant \\"I Wanna Go\\", and other great dance tracks like \\"Gasoline\\", \\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\", the deluxe edition exclusive \\"Up N Down\\" and \\"Selfish\\", and the disheveled \\"Trouble For Me\\" prove that Britney has what it takes to get you moving.  For some quieter, though still upbeat, moments, \\"How I Roll\\" is just awesome.  It's a slinky, sleek track that features heavily modified vocals and samples, but it just get into your head.  The guitar-driven \\"Criminal\\" is a highlight in my opinion, sounding like something Madonna would've done on her cowboy pop-tinged Music album.  It's not all rosy, however.  Like all Britney Spears albums, there are some duds on here.  Most notable are \\"Trip To Your Heart\\", which sounds like a good concept but totally misfires, and also the deluxe edition track \\"He About To Lose Me\\", which is beyond grating.  Lastly, the will.i.am-produced \\"Big Fat Bass\\" (which of course features will.i.am himself) is a repetitive, bloated mess.  Running almost 5 minutes, this song could've been much shorter and spared us the headache.  It sounds like a Black-Eyed Peas outtake that Fergie wouldn't touch.    Overall, if I could find one thing that brings this album down, it's the fact that Britney Spears herself almost seems like an afterthought on this record.  The songs are good, but they're also very generic.  Anyone could've recorded these songs, and they probably would've sounded just as good.  There's very little of Britney's spirit in the music here, as her lack of involvement in the album is plainly obvious.    Still, she DID sing on these songs, and as part of Brit's catalog, Femme Fatale is one of her stronger efforts thanks to the shiny production by her collaborators.  Not as great as Blackout, but it's a record that should be heard.
B000HLDFK4|2.0|While Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are an enjoyable couple sharing a time-traveling mailbox, I could never get past the mystery of how two people in two different years could be together for their romantic moments. I was too distracted by the time-lapse mystery to really enjoy the movie.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Downloaded this game while free. It has been well worth it as I enjoy the challenge of trying to beat my own scores. I'm going to download it to my husband's phone when he gets back in town. 99 cents isn't bad at all for this game. I'll gladly pay it!  Graphics are excellent on the Incredible. Haven't noticed any issues with it!
1400052181|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is not my usual fare of \\"big idea\\" non-fiction books. Part family biography and part medical science history, it is well-written but did not really have much of a pull factor for me... until the last third of the book. It was at that point that I became emotionally attached and fond of the Lacks family (Deborah and Zakariyya especially) and I was truly surprised by how emotional the final events made me.The book's afterward which goes into detail about the current uses of medical \\"waste\\" and the multi-billion dollar industry built from it is extremely interesting and underlines that many medical and scientific ethical issues have yet to be worked out, so don't skip it!
B000005S2Y|4.0|Vangelis has a track record for interesting music and parts of this was used in the PBS show \\"Cosmos.\\"  The haunting themes are inspiring.  Cosmos was a groundbreaking show of its time and this music was a great part of its success.
1401227821|5.0|This book is so good! I bought it in December last year, and I was blown away by a bunch of his colorful art. On each page, he typed down what happened to him, and what he was struggling with. In the first few pages, he explained his experiences in drawing both interiors and comic covers when he was young. He did about 35 issues (both covers AND interior pages) in the first four years. 35 issues is a lot! As I was reading through the whole book, he had great advices and secrets! Anyway, after 200-something pages, I wanted to read it again for inspiration.     In comparison of this book and other art books, this one still stands as the best art book hands down! After all the artbooks I looked into, I always turn myself to Cover Run, because of such quality he put in his work. Even after looking into Jim Lee's Icons or Alex Ross's Mythology, I STILL go back to looking at the pretty pictures Adam put in Cover Run.       Great book. A lot of fun. Beautiful art. Great writing. Worth every cent!       Brandon

Do get 1 size larger than a regular Croc, though. Wish Croc would make a replacement liner for these- plus the liner is very difficult to get out to clean, but that is the only gripe I have with them.  I've got two pair and they are great and look good too!

0307266303|5.0|Reading this book brought me to a complete turn-around when it  came to exercising and what it meant to my feet!  I had worn  orthotics for over twenty-five years.  I had arch supports in   every shoe or sandal I owned.  Christopher McDougall's illustration of the arch as the strongest  structure in architecture made me sit up and gasp. I ran to my  closet and tossed out every orthotic and arch support I had. He  made SO much sense!    My arches have given me no trouble since!    I subsequently ordered some footwear that mimics the barefoot feeling  but offers a little protection.  I've told everyone who walks, exercises as well as runs, to read this book.    My husband and I have drastically changed our mind about foot  support and what our feet were meant to do solely based on this book.  Amazing book Christopher McDougall!
0316069485|5.0|Few novels will keep me reading past 2 a.m., but this was one of them.  I've liked nearly all of Mr. Connelly's books and would include this among his best.    Haller, the defense lawyer who works out of his Lincoln auto-office, reverses himself to prosecute a child molester/murderer who is getting a new trial after some 20 years in prison.  Assisting Haller is his half-brother, Bosch, a detective seeking new evidence against the defendant.  We have met both Haller and Bosch in previous novels.  The plot is full of surprising turns, both in the courtroom and at large in Los Angeles, and the denouement is a shocker.  The author even left certain questions unanswered for the reader's imagination to answer.  I liked that.    I would rate the characters as excellent, along with the plot and the atmosphere.  However, the prose has a bit too much reliance on cliches.  Some of that should have been resolved in conferences between the author and his editor.  Still, this fault is not serious enough to cause a great deal of damage to the work.    I've read all the one-star reviews by Amazon readers and am at a loss to understand them.  It almost seems that several of these reviewers were not paying close attention.  I don't quibble with their not liking the book, but it doesn't seem fair that they base their dislike on untruth   I can't go into the instances as that would be giving the ending away.  My advice would be to ignore the negative comments.  This is a very good book, and I'm still sleepy from being up late to finish \\"The Reversal.\\"
1433502410|4.0|I like to have a balance of scholarship in my library and this, among others, covers the conservative branch. Very good notes, excellent translation, and superb typeface. The free online version that comes with the hard copy is a great plus!!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I read this book fast as I needed to share the book with my friends, too.  Not a good book to read before 'bedtime' but that is when I read.  Understanding can lead to anger, a good one for change to happen - real change, beyond mouthings?  A copy of \\"Job\\" should go to all legislators that can read, think, and see where real economic policy needs to be invoked and enforced.  Making laws with no enforcement funding is hypocrisy at its most flagrant level - lowest level in \\"The Inferno\\"?      Also - \\"Hypocracy is what Democracy becomes when politicians become, routinely, liars.\\" (Urban Dictionary)
B004LUS390|4.0|Great app! Plus, it works well on both my Motorola Droid and Notion Ink Adam, so that's a huge plus. However, I'm disappointed that it does not have landscape mode. It would easily be five stars if landscape mode was added.

B004KD5TQI|5.0|There are very few movies with soundtracks that capture the essence of the corresponding parts of the movie and help the listener remember the movie vividly while listening to the soundtrack.  In the past, I have found this to be the case with bombastic soundtracks of \\"Tron\\", \\"Inception\\", \\"300\\", \\"Dark Knight\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", and \\"Mission Impossible\\".    However, this was not the case with \\"Sucker Punch\\" soundtrack before I watched the movie.  Listening to the soundtrack after watching the movie, I could recollect the movie vividly and the experience of watching the movie.  Of course, the soundtrack is loud and wild, and that is the best part given the context of the movie.  I have quite a few soundtracks (ranging from \\"Sound of Music\\", \\"Love Story\\", and \\"Empire Records\\") and this one is already in my list of favourite soundtracks.    This is an example of a great soundtrack that befits the cool movie.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, haven't been so in love with Disney since The Little Mermaid, and I'm 32. I took my daughter to see it 3 times in the theaters, and now we have ordered it to share it with all our friends. It is beautiful and funny, tear-jerking and heart warming, and exciting. The music is great, the art is amazing, and the story is classic. See it, you won't regret it, and then share it with people you love.

B0009F2EPU|3.0|A strong cast is misserved by a weak production with odds and ends that distract without illuminating. If you are looking for one DVD of the Ring to own, stick with the Metropolitan Opera under the direction of Levine
B0041KKYBK|5.0|This is a well organized and presented documentary on what greed can do to commerce and Capitalism in general.<br />The persistent, organized and guiltless pursuit of immoral and ruinous gains is what makes this the story about a Fascist brand of Capitalism.<br />This video is more of the same in the sense that the trouble always seems to start with the battle cry,\\"What we need is deregulation, after all, private enterprise can do it better than government!\\" Just like the ENRON story.<br />This is not meant to damn Capitalism but to point out the nature and methodology of those who would ruin it for EVERY ONE.<br />Definitely worth the watch.

B004SMD4H2|5.0|I am not a fan of Stephen King. He usually tries to slam Christianity every chance he gets so I usually avoid anything he does. Not sure why I gave this a try but I am glad I did. It took a couple episodes for everything to start to mesh but by the middle of the season it was great. I am really looking forward to its return. The only problem is, whenever I recommend it to anyone... they haven't heard of it. Give it a chance and you won't be sorry.

When it came time to play the movie the tracking was horrible and would not adjust with my tracking controls.  The color jumps from B&W to Color constantly, and the tape jumps scenes.

B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Awsome sequence of songs of what I call \\"Happy Music\\". A couple of what I call \\"Dudds,\\" But that's what they make a skip button for. At home I let the entire DVD play. I regularly listen to about 80% of the CD in my car, and I turn it up and car dance. I'm 49 and I'm still having fun. The guitar player and the horn section are awsome. Well, Jason is, Jason. Great CD/DVD, I love LIVE music.  NH

B004IFYN2Y|5.0|Doug Liman's \\"Fair Game\\" is the contemporary sibling to Alan J. Pakula's [[ASIN:B00407PNX8 All the President's Men]]. \\"Fair Game,\\" like \\"All the President's Men,\\" tells an important true story about how dangerous the clashing between media and government can be and that we should always hold people accountable for their actions, regardless of the positions they hold. \\"Fair Game\\" is a taunt political thriller that is accurate to the events but also gripping in a cinematic way. The performances from Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are terrific and the film is well written with snappy dialogue. Long story shot, \\"Fair Game\\" is fine tuned, adult entertainment. The film makes you think, it's relevant, and exciting. It's important for films based on true events, where the outcome is already know, to remain engrossing, and \\"Fair Game\\" is certainly that.<br /><br />On a side note, one of the biggest mysteries of the 2010 movie year was how completely overlooked Naomi Watt's performances were. She had a trio of tremendous films that were totally ignored. To understand what I am talking about you must check out Rodrigo Garcia's [[ASIN:B003EYVXQO Mother and Child]], Woody Allen's [[ASIN:B003UESJCY You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger]] and of course \\"Fair Game.\\" She is one of the best actresses working today and deserves much more credit than she is getting.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|If you are a fan of Pink Floyd, this video is a must have! The addition of the Directors Cut is a very interesting plus! I had always listened to Pink Floyd since I was a teenager and having many of the Floyds albums I was amazed that I had never even heard of the Live at Pompeii movie. I stumbled across some videos on the internet that were from the film and I purchased the video via Amazon.Com. Upon viewing the video when I received it, which came rather quickly, a renewed pashion for the Pink Floyd music struck me. I have since ordered \\"Pulse\\" on DVD and \\"Meddle\\" on CD which I should receive tomorrow.<br />Shine On You Crazy Diamonds!!!!!!!!!!!

B00005JKLZ|4.0|The Time Machine, 2002, is called a remake.  I assume people think of it as a remake of the 1960 version.  There is, as many of you know, the BOOK that started it all.  In my review I will compare the 2002 movie to both of these.  I have not had the pleasure of watching the TV movie, or movies, so I can't use those in my reviews.  There will be spoilers.<br />The movie, as pointed out, came out in 2002, and the DVD around 2003.  The special effects are mostly computer generated and don't come out too well on the TV screen - at least not mine.  The movie, as you can guess, is heavy in computer generated effects.  The problem is, we have seen it all before.  Time travel allows us to see the landscape change, buildings fall into ruins, and organic material rot.  We have seen it before and, in some cases, better than this in other science fiction movies and PBS specials.<br />The plot starts out with more substance then the book or 1960 movie.  The Time Traveler is motivated to change the past.  In fact he works four years on it, doing nothing else and, in fact, going a tad insane with his need to travel back in time.  Why he needs to I will leave unsaid so not to spoil it but it does differ from the book and 1960 movie.  In the book he wants to travel to the future because he wants to.  He is looking for adventure.  In the 1960 movie he is sick of humankind and hopes the future is better.<br />In other words, the 2002 does add more meat to the plot.  But is that helpful?  It does slow it down yet character building always does.<br />He tries to change the past once the machine is finished but fails.  The Traveler comes to understand that changing the past is, maybe not impossible, at least beyond his skills and he decides to go FORWARD in time to find somebody who can help him.  Why he thinks future humans would help him CHANGE his past, and therefore their past, is not a logical flaw as much as it shows how much stress and pressure he is in to carry out his mission.  He has become cold, self-centered, out of touch with the world - it is not bad acting.<br />NOW here comes why I did not give the movie five stars.  The rest of the film becomes a mess of bad science, bad story telling, and just bad...bad.  And here be spoilers.<br />First, we do meet a cool Library Computer, which is really nothing more than what we MAY have later in the 21 Century.  Not only that but the future looks clean, everybody is healthful, and we have people on the Moon.  But then...well, it all goes wrong.<br />First, the Moon is destroyed.  Which seems to happen a lot in sci-fi.  While the film makes it clear it is our fault, it does not make it clear just how.  We know there was a colony on the Moon and we know that we were using it for other reasons, but what happened?  Details people.<br />The Time Traveler moves forward again, finding humans have recovered, in which we all look alike, live in homes on the side of cliffs, and use natural resources to survive.  These people are the Eloi.  Oh, has he found paradise?  No.  Because the human race has split off into two groups.  The Morlocks, creatures who live underground live off the Eloi.  In more ways than one.  This is explained to him by the LIBRARY COMPUTER which has somehow lasted thousands of years.  Poor thing.  But the Time Traveler decides he has to change things - or at least save the hot chick he was growing interested in.  So he invades the Morlocks' underground city.  And is of course captured.<br />Here the Time Traveler finds out that the reason he can not change the past is because to do so means he would never design or build a Time Machine.  So he can NEVER change the past.  Which is funny, because after zipping forward to see the world ruled by the Morlocks, he comes back and changes the past.  But maybe because it was not HIS past but changing his FUTURE, he could get away with it.<br />The end result is a feeling that the story got derailed halfway through the movie.  Or maybe the writers got lazy.  The Time Traveling Scientist becomes a fist-swinging Hero.  The quest to understand time and the nature of it gets pushed to one side as it becomes a simple fight between Good and Evil.  In the book it was evolution that had made two different races, one the cattle, one the butchers.  The 1960 movie tried to stay close to that, adding World Wars to help it along so that the Eloi come out as idiot children and the Morlocks are whip carrying meat eaters.  The Morlocks came out as the bad guys but you did not think of them as EVIL, with a big E.  Maybe evil with a letter e, like an illness or a hose fire.  But this movie needs to make the Morlocks EVIL, to the point of giving them a voice in a super-Morlock.  Because the Time Traveler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, uses his Time Machine to kill them all.  Or at least the Morlocks in this underground city.<br />The end result, plus the extras, mean that this gets a solid four.  The movie, by itself, would have gotten a three.cientist becomes a fist-swinging Hero.

B0043RSJ8G|1.0|I have read every one of Jodi's books.  I eagerly await each one.  I am always impressed with the character development in the stories.  Sing You Home had entirely too many twists and turns to develop the characters of Zoe, Max and Vanessa.  As I ended the book, I really wanted to know more about Lucy.  A story about just Zoe's music therapy and Lucy's reaction would have been much more engrossing than the courtroom antics of this book.  Please, a one-night stand with the sister-in-law?  I will still await the next book and keep my fingers crossed.

Granted, there's only 10 songs here (a little light given the number of years between albums), but with only 10 songs, they should be much better than this. What a terrible month for music... I've been waiting years for great new music from the Strokes and Radiohead (King of Limbs)... guess I'll have to continue to wait.

B00009ATIX|1.0|I have a rule when watching movies.  I refuse to watch part of a movie and make a decision about the movie.  In this case I am oh so sorry that I followed my rule.  This is the most depressingly boring POS that I have ever witnessed.  I was totally shocked that some of the other reviewers actually pretended that they liked this movie.  Oh well, there is no accounting for taste.<br /><br />The premise of the story was, I will admit, thought provoking.  the problem is that whenever there was a chance to make things interesting the director seemed to want to bore his audience to tears.  I kept hoping that it would get better but it never did.<br /><br />it seemed as if the director told his cast to do everything as slooowwwly as possible and to drag things out as long as they could.  One camera pan that encompassed about ten feet took 20 years.  George Clooney reached out to take the hand of a child and it took 15 years.  Simply walking around a prop would take one of the actors 7 1/2 years.  I understand that sometimes a director will draw out a motion for effect but it doesn't have to be done EVERY SINGLE TIME!  I really wanted to like this movie but it was not at all possible for me to do so.<br /><br />In the past, whenever anyone asked me to name the worst movie I ever saw I had a quick and easy answer - Silent Running.  Now I have found a movie to take its place.  I started to be insulting and give this movie 1/2 star but it doesn't even deserve that!

B000WZB944|5.0|During the U2's most prolific and profound period as artists they released a series of stunning, original albums influenced by the musical alphabet from The Band to Television. One of their most popular albums (in terms of sales and critical acclaim)\\"The Joshua Tree\\" has aged amazingly well--yes, there are songs on here that may lack the stylistic invention of, say, their best album (in my opinion of course)\\"Achtung Baby\\" but the solid musical bedrock, stylistic absorption, themes and sheer songwriting depth on this album is hard to beat.<br /><br />The two disc remastered edition has been on my want list for a long time but I put it off--I have the Mobile Fidelity verison (and yes I'm aware that the Japanese first pressing on CD is also desired and thought by many to be the best sounding but I disagree that assessment)which beats every CD version I've heard and that includes the remaster for the first disc here which does sound quite good over all.<br /><br />The reason to get this though is the second disc of b-sides which were started during the main album but often finished just after (in the case of one song 20 years LATER). One of my favorite songs \\"Silver and Gold\\" gets two very different readings; one with Bono performing with Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones (originally on the \\"Sun City\\" album from 1985)and the second band version with a much fuller arrangement. Both have their merit but I prefer the sparse arrangement and vocal of the first-still it's great to have both.<br /><br />Likewise \\"Luminous Times\\" and \\"The Sweetest Kiss\\" are both strong material with the later being uncharacteristically tender and, well, pop-like with it's light arrangement. There are also less essential items like the single edit of \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" (which some fans will find essential)but the best b-sides here (most of which I had on CD-singles or 45's before this set)hold up quite well and shine despite the large shadow \\"The Joshua Tree\\" casts and they often act as lighter, less serious counterweights to the darker main album.<br /><br />The deluxe hardcover miniature book features notes by The Edge about the making of the album, photos from the sessions for the album cover as well as full credits on the making of the album and fill out an already nice package. The only complaint I have are the CD holders which are made out of rough cardboard and could easily rip or scratch the discs. The hardcover slip jacket for the book is very sturdy.

B00138JAB8|5.0|Dylan had just moved to New York the year before this release.  He had made several recordings in hotel rooms, peoples' houses, low grade studios; he had played at coffee houses and other venues in Greenwich Village, and had even played at Carnegie Chapter Hall in late 1961. The time was now ripe for him to set his work to vinyl.  The result is this first of Bob Dylan's studio albums.  Surprisingly, given Dylan's reputation as one of the greatest lyricists of the last 50 years, there are only two Dylan originals here: \\"Song To Woody\\" and \\"Talkin' New York.\\"  Another surprise is the subject matter here - the number of songs about death and dying leaves the listener with some measure of morbidity.  Hardly a good starting point for a musician who has maintained his dedication to the music industry for more than 50 years.  What a meager beginning.  So why should this album count as anything beyond Dylan's first attempt at professional work?  It should for two reasons: 1) having few originals establishes Dylan as a creative stylist and vocalist.  I know that might sound strange given Dylan's reputation as a \\"bad singer, but a good song writer.\\"  Well the bad singer reputation gains its momentum from those who never get beyond a cursory listen of Dylan's work.  He's a great singer in his genre, though that realization requires some work commensurate with an acquired taste.  What makes Dylan a great singer is his ability to turn a phrase such that the emotional appeal is optimized.  This ability is apparent throughout this album. 2) This album establishes dylan as not just a coffee house performer, but a performer with mass appeal to the caliber of a concert hall and eventually as a stadium performer.  It's a piece of musical history, which moves him forward from meager beginnings - it's the spark, that got the ball rolling for Dylan's long and tremendous career.   So sometime in late 1961, after gaining a regular following by playing at Gerde's Folk City, where he received a favorable review in the New York Times after meeting Columbia Producer John Hammond several weeks prior, he entered the Columbia studio with a guitar and harmonica and recorded the following official releases and four outtakes:    You're No Good (Jesse Fuller) - This is the opener and shortest song on the album, very reminiscent of Dylan's own \\"All I Really Want To Do.\\"    Talkin' New York (Dylan) An excellent introduction to Dylan's whimsical style on many of his original walking blues numbers like \\"Talkin' World War III Blues.\\"     In My Time Of Dyin' (Trad.) - Dylan's arrangements of traditional folk/blues standards often departed from the norm, and this is the first recorded example of this dynamic.    Man Of Constant Sorrows (Trad.) - Dylan here departs from the bluegrass tradition of this song and performs it as a folk song with just guitar and harmonica.  It works quite nicely - probably one of the highlights of this album.    Fixin' To Die (Bucka White) - The 2nd death song after \\"Time of Dyin.'\\"  - Here Dylan displays his full blues prowess with both his singing and his guitar playing.    Pretty Peggy-O - (Trad.) Another Dylan arrangement of a traditional folk song.    Highway 51 Blues (Curtis Jones) This song ends side one of the vinyl record.  On this number Dylan builds in power and momentum and does not hold back.  He's going somewhere here that is far more than simply a jaunt down an old highway.  I think he wants us to know that.    Gospel Plow (Trad.) Dylan repeats here the momentum of Highway 51 Blues.  The harmonica here is used as a rhythm instrument here as much as for melodic backup.  It's quite effective.    Baby, Let Me Follow You Down (Eric Von Schmidt) I've always loved this song for Dylan's introduction \\"I first heard this from ah Rick Von Schmidt.  Rick's a blues guitar player.  I met him one day in the green pastures of ah Harvard University.\\"  It sounds like a compliment and an insult at the same time, depending on how you take it.And it's classic Dylan elusiveness.    House Of The Rising Sun (Trad.)  Dylan uses Dave Von Ronk's arrangement of this traditional folk song here and it works beautifully.    Freight Train Blues (Roy Acuff)  You'll never have as much fun listening to Dylan as with this one.  He plays with it like it's a favorite toy.  Quite enjoyable, though rather short.    Song To Woody (Dylan)  This is Dylan's first tribute song, and it's a winner.  Few have covered this one, perhaps due to the lyric: \\"Hey hey, Woody Guthrie I wrote you a song....\\" not wanting to get into hot water with that claim.      See That My Grave Is Kept Clean (Blind Lemon Jefferson)  It's fitting that Dylan ends with a great blues number from Blind L Jefferson - a taste of things to come from this iconic performer, who has been influenced by nothing but the best.    All in all \\"Bob Dylan\\" is an album that can be listened to often enough that the songs and lyrics become familiar.  There are very few artists who are able to create something that is as lasting and enjoyable as Dylan's studio efforts.    There were 4 outtakes recorded for this album - \\"He Was a Friend of Mine,\\" \\"Man On The Street,\\" Woody Guthrie's \\"Ramblin' Blues\\" and \\"House Carpenter.\\"  All but Ramblin' Blues can be heard on Dylan's first Bootleg Series album.

1401310400|2.0|I was intrigued by the notion of a double fiction: a fictional character writes a fiction and it's all drawn off a TV show.  The TV show is actually well written and entertaining.  The book falls short.  For avid fans, who don't read much, the book probably passes muster.  You can imagine the dialogue in the mouths of the characters you know.  For anyone who doesn't watch the show, it's just bad writing.  The dialogue would work on a TV script, it doesn't in a novel.  There are a huge number of TV and modern cultural references which make it obvious this novel was written for a TV audience.  I read the book because the concept is clever.  I won't read any more.  Interestingly, the best written portion of the book is the acknowledgment after the novel.  That's where the fictional Richard Castle thanks his fictional family.  That part was actually well written.

B000003NA4|3.0|I love to discover new artists and I am trying to appreciate jazz. For me, it seems to still be an acquired taste.  There's no doubt that Diana Krall has a rich, low voice, but I wonder if it's being wasted - at least on this CD.  I have tried now several times to listen to this album and I find it monotone and lifeless.  This is not a commentary on the Diana's potential, but for those of us who like more of a melody, this may not be the album for you.  I'll give it a few more listens and leave some more commentary.

0375836675|5.0|this book is great. if you are looking for a fast pace great imagery novel. the whole time you are reading it you want to know whats going to happen next and that is what i love in a book. my class read this book together and we would read one chapter at a time and every day when we were done with the chapter everyone would sigh because we just wanted to keep reading it. this book is great for any age, it will always keep you guessing. i recomend making predictions at the begining of the book because it is realloy fun to see and compare what happened at the begining to the end. the book takes place in australia so they have some sayings like mate, and when they talk about pie with sauce it isnt like a apple or pumpkin pie its a meat pie.when the author writes his metafores he will almost say the exact opposite of what it really is so it paints a vivid picture in your head where you feel like you are actually there, you say to yourself wow, i can see that.i hope you read this book and enjoy it, this is a book with an ending that goes past the pages.

We paid $18 for it and I feel that it was a good purchase.

0767802659|4.0|Some years back I was working away from home on a major project. One night, with my brains feeling fried, I decided that I needed a mindless action adventure to watch. I remembered some very smart people I knew recommending \\"Starship Troopers\\" because it was \\"just mindless fun\\". So I got the \\"mindless fun\\" dvd and sat down to watch something that would not excite one single brain cell.     Instead of mindless fun I discovered a disturbing movie that insinuated itself into your mind telling you that this was about the good guys, when there were all the signs that you were on the wrong side. I found it to be truly scary because all these people who had recommended it thought it was superficial fun. They didn't get it! They bought the propaganda! But there displayed boldly on the screen was something very like an updated Nazi war propaganda movie. Remember the three friends? Well the smart guy goes into military intelligence, wears a black leather coat just like the Gestapo and executes prisoners of war because they are just animals. The girl dons a uniform with similar colour and design to the Luftwaffe and goes into the space force.    The rhetoric and cheesy dialog just adds to the impression of a propaganda movie and the digital aspects lure us away from thinking of the links with the past. And the scenes from Earth done in a sepia/black-white of the huge meetings beneath a huge banner with ... what kind of symbol is that? Nice. Very clever.    This may not be Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" but it is worth seeing in its own right. Not something you see again and again though once the message sinks in.
B0026772N8|2.0|All this book was, was Walden on a Motorcycle. Too Folksy for my taste. It had been on my reading list for years though, so I read it. If its on yours and you read Walden and did not get much out of Walden, you won't get much out of this either. You really have to be in the right frame of mind, IE stoned. Wish I would have read this then like when I was 20. Oh well.
B001KTRFRG|4.0|I had never bought a movie for the PSP before but this was a good movie.  The small screen will put a lot of people off but it was a new experience.<br />As for the movie itself the Dark Knight was brilliant.  There are some things which stretch believability, for example, the Joker places bombs pretty much where he wants.  In a post September 11 world this is bizzare.  Batman's gadgets are cool and Christian Bale does a fine job as Batman not being a typical hero.  Heath Ledger as the Joker was inspired.  The producers have accidently dug a hole for themselves with Heath's death.  He will never be able to return for a sequel, and it's difficult to see anyone equalling him.  One character I found extremely annoying was the pathetic Harvey Dent.  He is a big time hero and then becomes a villain within minutes.  When the going gets tough Harvey just packs it in, and goes on a rampage.

0756404738|5.0|\\"Name of The Wind\\" was a stunning book, and \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" is every bit as good!  These books are an absolute masterpiece.  Pat Rothfuss' writing is of spectacular quality, bringing a vivid detail that that had me cringing and laughing aloud during nearly every reading. The attention to detail and continuity of the story line bring the books to life.     These books are some of the best I've ever read, right up there with Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\", Herberts \\"Dune\\" and Carey's \\"Kushiel's Series.\\"  After writing this review, I'll be sending Pat a note, imploring him to keep it up; and to take what ever time is required to finish this exceptional series at the amazing level he has begun and now extended it.    This is the kind of book that you can't put down, and hate that you are nearing the end.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Over 100 reviews and almost all of them 5 stars. Yeah, Community is a great show, possibly one of the best on TV right now. Which is saying a lot considering it's only a half hour sitcom. The first season was good, but with the currently airing second season, they have really been consistently phenomenal. I recommend this to everyone with a pulse who has at least a nominal claim to this new-fangled thing called a sense of humor.

B002LLE3Q8|5.0|This quintessential album begins the career of King Crimson, a.k.a. Robert Fripp and those musicians he chooses to create his musical vision as his \\"group\\".  And it has all the elements of all later Crimson albums: terrifying intensity alternating with delicate, incredible beauty and ALWAYS superb musicianship.  A fitting beginning in the very late 1960s, somewhat comparable to the contemporary Moody Blues in their use of flute, Mellotron, and exquisite guitar but of considerably darker vision and more psychedelic, mystical, and cynical.  \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is truly a premonition of things to come, both with the band and the world at large, with blistering intensity and a truly terrifying message, then when you think you just can't stand it anymore comes \\"I Talk to the Wind\\", a welcome respite of amazing loveliness yet sharp and contrarian words: \\"You don't posess me, don't impress me...\\"  Then the very dark and cynical \\"Epitaph\\", quite literally about the end of the world at \\"the hands of fools\\"...Then another break with the mystical \\"Moonchild\\" with a long (and early for its day) ambient instrumental section, exploded by \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\", a huge enormous piece of mystical magical reference with overwhelming Mellotrons sweeping you away to lyrics about a Medevil city populated by a purple piper, the keeper of the city keys, the black queen, the fire witch, the gardener, the pattern juggler, the orchestra, widows, wise men, the yellow jester, the puppets, and of course, The Crimson King.  J.R.R. Tolkien would have been proud!  All intertwined with amazing flute solos and Robert Fripp's incredible guitar playing.<br /><br />If you are a fan of King Crimson and/or the music of the 1960s, this is an absolute MUST HAVE.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Having just finished \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\", I eagerly moved on to \\"The Reversal\\". I started out with the greatest of expectations being that I found Lincoln to be one of the best legal thrillers I have read in recent times.    Unfortunately, Connelly failed to flesh out his characters, therefore leaving them somewhat one-dimensional. Had I not read a prior novel with Haller as lead, I would not have found him to be of much substance. As it were, I did not feel a connection with Bosch as this was my first encounter with him.     I found the story interesting from a legal standpoint, as Connelly detailed the legal aspects  almost to the point of tediousness. Good things to know but too in-depth if you prefer  more of the relational aspects of books.    I will try another of his books, as I do not want to give up on Connelly just yet. I do  think he has merit as a writer and hope that this work just fell a bit short of his norm.

The sound is slightly off at times from the movement of the mouth. The first 15 minutes or so the motion of the picture also seemed slightly off as well. Don't know if I got a bad copy or if its because they crammed 205 minutes on a standard one sided disk. Glad I only paid 5 bucks.

0061537969|1.0|I cant believe this book is a best seller.  Its boring, superficial, and totally unbelievable.  I am a huge dog lover and was interested in this book for that reason.  What a disappointment. I love dogs, but we all know they are pretty simplistic beings -albeit intuitive, but simple and sweet.  This book is not written from the perspective of a dog.  Its too brainy and philosophical to be believable and I found it very annoying.  It was a waste of my time.

The holiday version and the original loose too much graphics and just barely loads.  It may be the phone.  I even invested in the $0.99 version to no better luck.  Wasted money but I got Rio free so not too bad a lose.  Except it does get boring.  Level 2-5 Rio is absolutely impossible so I quit!

B000JQUMPI|5.0|I am a little girl and I read this long version when I was eight. I love this book, and have read it several times. If you liked this book, I reccommend reading Little Men and Jo's Boys. Readers will get caught in the adventures of Meg and her dealings with her sisters,Jo and her manners,Beth and her shyness, and Amy and her &#34;ladylike&#34;actions. You will be caught in the relatinship between Jo and Laurie.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|If ever a macro or gif was needed for a book, it's this one.<br /><br />I bought this for my 10 year old daughter but I always read a book before I hand it over. What the hell were these two thinking? Now for everyone going \\"Oh, Twilight\\", that was terrible too but not nearly as bad as this steaming pile.<br /><br />First off the main character is OBNOXIOUS. To a fault. She's perfect. Literally. She's respectful, smart, pretty, moral, GREAT WITH HORSES (LOL), teh chozen one, and has a diverse (read: racist and sexist) group of friends. Let me move onto her friends. They are all really bad cliche models of their stereotype. For instance she has a token black friend. Her name is \\"Shawnee\\". She also talks in mild ghetto slang while being down on the education system. She also has a token gay friend! He's effeminate and full of himself. He's always trying to add new words to their vocabularies and \\"teach\\" them things. And don't even get me started on Stevie Ray.<br /><br />Did I mention the slut shaming? This book is FULL OF IT. When Zoey gets kissed by Erik she's a \\"slut\\". Everyone is a slut. It's ridiculous. And for it to be after the \\"forced oral sex part\\" (that had NOTHING to do with the plot) it seemd even dumber.<br /><br />And why in GOD'S NAME is she spelling it \\"vampyre\\"? It's damn pretentious. Normally I will read an entire series despite how bad it is. I did read book two, which is WORSE than book one (and more insulting and degrading), however, I can't bring myself to read book three.

B002ZG994U|5.0|GREAT movie.  Loved the A-team when I was a kid and this movie was absolutely marvelous!  They kept the core idea of the show, updated it to the current conflicts, took out the ridiculous parts (no one getting killed/injured in the explosions), and made Murdock crazier (how was that possible?) than ever.  Actors are believable as the characters without stretching the imagination and it filled in the back story that was only implied in the original show.      Instead of a campy movie off of a great TV show this was a GREAT movie off of a great TV show and I could easily see a revamped the TV show with this movie to start it off anew- as long as they choose the right actors again and stick close to the grain of the old show of Robin Hoods it would be great.

B004IFYMWK|5.0|FAIR GAME serves several purposes; it is a thriller of a suspense movie that entertains, it addresses one of the most controversial aspects of American military action in years, and it dares to open the secret doors of the Bush Administration.  Based on the book 'The Politics of Truth' by Joseph Wilson the film has been summarized as follows: 'Joseph Charles Wilson IV (born November 6, 1949) is a former United States diplomat best known for his 2002 trip to Niger to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase yellowcake uranium; his New York Times op ed piece, \\"What I Didn't Find in Niger\\"; and the subsequent \\"outing\\" of his wife Valerie Plame as a CIA agent.' and the book \\"Fair Game' by Valerie Plame. The books have been transformed into a bitingly vital screenplay by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and the film is searingly directed by Doug Lyman.<br /><br />Why the film didn't enjoy a better success in the theaters is likely due to the still festering difference of opinion as to the pre-emptive war on Iraq, a war declared because of the 'evidence' that Iraq had Weapons of Mass destruction that is now approaching 10 years in activity despite the embarrassingly early declaration by that the war had been 'won' soon after declaration.  What FAIR GAME offers is Wilson's defense of his wife Valerie Plame's role in the CIA and how the government dealt with the coverup and smoke screen and other shenanigans by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby and other White House officials who revealed Plame's status as a CIA agent and were allegedly out to discredit her husband after he wrote a 2003 New York Times op-ed piece saying that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to justify the invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />The actors are consistently superb throughout the large cast - Naomi Watts as Valerie Plame, Sean Penn as Joe Wilson, Bruce McGill as Jim Pavitt, Adam LeFevre as Karl Rove, David Andrews as Scooter Libby - and the many film clips of President Bush's televised speeches and statements from VP  Dick Cheney et al add credence to the atmosphere.  It is a film about the value of truth and as such it makes us all think more carefully about our current further involvement in the many battles currently being fought in the countries of the Middle East.  There is a speech Joe Wilson gives to his class at the end of the film that challenges his students to always defend democracy - the legacy of our Founding Fathers - and it is this speech that is the most compelling writing in the film.  A fine cast delivers a compelling film and it is a film all Americans should see.

0312360258|1.0|I really don't have anything good to say about this book. At first, I thought maybe just maybe it had some potential. I was wrong and it was a waste of $. The dialogue was immature...I know it's been a decade since I was a teen but who says poopie, boobie, and such except for elementary students? The characters were under-developed and repetitive. It was hard to finish.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|I've read a lot of negative things about season 8 of Smallville, but as someone who just watched every gripping episode (especially the episode \\"Legion\\" ) season 8 is truly the greatest season up to this point.  This season is truly remarkable due completely to the acting of Allison Mack (Chloe),  Sam Witwer (Davis Bloom / Doomsday), and Tom Welling (Clark Kent) . We actually can believe that Clark is becoming the Hero we all know and adore. Allison plays a girl whose recent history is nothing but disaster and heartache so well you would actually think that she was going through all of this.  Sam is someone who should have been a regular on the show for so much longer.  And let supern nerds say what they will the way they approached Doomsday was truly amazing.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Although this book was highly readable, I've got mixed feelings about it and don't really understand the hype surrounding this book.<br /><br />First, this book does contain quite a few scenes that depict graphic (often sexual) violence against women.  I also understand that the author attempted to bring attention to the issue of violence against women in Sweden.  Nevertheless, I don't think that this particular story constitutes the best vehicle for the message, as I would guess that most violence against women remains domestic violence rather than the serial killer-type depicted here.  Additionally, the (plot spoilers ahead) cover up of the multiple crimes against women in this book effectively ensures that the reader understands that these crimes pale in comparative importance to the financial conspiracy and Blomkvist's eventual redemption.<br /><br />Secondly, I found the characters underdeveloped.  Salander, of course, remains the most interesting character, but her limited expressiveness makes it difficult to understand Blomkvist's attraction to her.  Blomkvist himself, as the protagonist, seems flat and two dimensional.  His relationship with Salander seems contrived and cliche.  I honestly thought that the book would have been stronger if Blomkvist hadn't actually slept with nearly all of the novel's main female characters.  Overall, its hard to get a feel for who these people actually are and why we should care about them.<br /><br />This book is quite readable and moves quickly, but its overall message and lack of character development left me distinctly underwhelmed.  I think I'll pass on the rest of the series.
1439102724|5.0|Usually when I read novels, I speed through and think later, but when I finished the first chapter, I decided to take it slow. This novel is amazing. It enlightens the reader to political and social issues with both liberal and conservative viewpoints, and it brings you to understand what many LGBT couples have to suffer through in this, the twenty-first century.    Again, I highly recommend this novel to anyone, and at this price, how could you resist?
B004DMIIOG|5.0|From everything that is out there with anime movies, that aren't OVA's from a series, this is one of the best.  It has great action a little Matrix like.  And great comedy, along with some heartwarming and wrenching moments.  The one problem I had with the movie were the little kids running around.  All the other people in the movies were great and had their own personality the kids were thrown in for comic relief and just came out as an annoynce.      At the start I thought the computer generated Oz was going to be an odd addition to a story that had to do with the family party but the writer rolled them together.      With everything I thought it was a great movie, I hope they don't ruin the good with adding a sequel or trying to turn it into a series, don't think they will but you never know.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I got this from the Android market, not Amazon. It's been great for finding free hotspots and connecting to them (there's a helper app that you need to install in order to connect through this utility.) It will remember networks that you have manually connected to and automatically connect to those in the future, but it doesn't automatically connect to other networks. It also provides an option to forget a network, and therefore not automatically reconnect. (I believe all this is available under Settings of Android, but it's very easy here.)  In addition to the AP list, it also shows how congested each channel is, on the channel rating graph. This is designed to help you intelligently choose what channel to configure your own AP to. There are also charts of AP strengths, either against time or against channel.  Simple interface, but a very handy utility. I use it almost every day.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B003FVI2KQ AMD Phenom II X6 Six-Core Processor 1090T (3.2GHz) AM3, HDT90ZFBGRBOX (Black Edition)]]    This is actually my 2nd build and this one is for myself. The 1st was for a business client and that was the most powerful system I have ever built. I... of coarse envy that build and wish I had one for me. So here it is and writing a review for it. For the price I got it for, and the use of this computer to me, I have no regrets. I am also glad I got this 6-core instead of 2 or 4 cores. I would be wondering if I have made the wrong choice if I got the 2 or 4 cores instead right now. So now I have no worries. I have a Cooler Master 212 for this so it's huge but to get 45-degrees C. under stress is amazing. It's also very quiet so it's no bother at all. I can't recommend intel products right now for this price. They need to learn about overpricing of their CPU must stop. I've been playing my PS2 games on this computer through emulator and yeah, you can guess. I've had intel E6400 core 2 duo for a long time and this Phenom II X6 1090T made that computer a history I've already forgotten but due to this review I had to bring it up again. If you are hesitating for a long time, then you loose all those time. This CPU should be with me for a long while since I don't think intel will lower their prices comparable to AMD for yet another decade.
B000EWBKK8|5.0|One of the most under-rated movies I've seen in years.  Nick Cage is superb, and the tongue-in-cheek humor is truly hilarious while simultaneously striking a chord with reality.  This is hands down great work.  Great film.
B00004U8JU|5.0|This is a great movie.  I can't wait to watch it again with my children once they are a little older.  I love a storyline that seems unbelievable but is presented in a way that makes you wonder, \\"What if?\\"
0385342047|1.0|This book was awful, and that's not an exaggeration. Up until 'Sister', The Shopaholic series has made me laugh til I cried, avoid sleep until I finished, and beg friends to read them. 'Sister' ended that; 'Shopaholic & Baby' was tolerable, but this 'Mini' book ended my fascination with Rebecca Bloomwood Brandon. It was SO bad. I think the only time I chuckled was****spoiler**** the parts with the priest.  That's a long way from the time when I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.    Without rehashing everything, I will say it was definitely disappointing to see Becky up to her same old tricks. I mean, come on. The character should still be 'Becky,' but not the Becky from the first novel. (Even Stephanie Plum got a little bit better at bounty hunting.) Becky's married, a mother, and a few years older. What's clear is she's not wiser. When you think about how many marriages end over secrecy and money, it's amazing that Luke is still with her. She's still so over-the-top. It was quite frustrating to read, and I definitely ended up skimming through.     And I really hated that their child was such a brat. It's not surprising given how they treat her, but it was so over-the-top.     Just like the Stephanie Plum books around books 13-16, this series is out of gas. So glad I picked it up from my library. Read at your own risk. I'm upset I read it b/c I loved this series.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|There are hundreds of reviews, so I shouldn't bother, but: this is worth the money.  Pixar doesn't dissappoint.  My son, like most children, will watch the same movie with keen interest three, four, or five times in a row.  Usually, I grab a magazine or the laptop to keep myself busy.  With Toy Story 3, I don't mind watching it.  There is humor, but the best part is truly the storyline, which I will not spoil.  Watch TS3, and you will, no doubt, be reminiscent of a favorite childhood toy.  Even more amazing, I truly believe that many parents, young and old, will feel themselves tear up as they think of their own children, who were playing with toys just yesterday, preparing to leave for college.  I have heard friends and family comment that they almost (male) or did (female) cry at the end.  When was the last time that happened on movie night?
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Wow!  I have been a fan of science fiction movies and tv shows since I was like 4 years old.  Now that i'm older and I understand all of the behind-the-sences things that going into them I love them even more.  When I first heard about BSG, I ignored it (being overly addicted to Stargate).  But after my roommates got me to watch the mini-series I had to buy the first two seasons to catch up!  Now, going back and getting to watch the whole awesome show from the beginning in Blu-ray, its like being a kid all over again.  (Ok, I admit, I wouldn't have watched a show with so much frakking going on when I was 5, but who cares.)
B00003CX95|5.0|This is an epic tale of someone who refused to accept the status quo.  The movie is long, but you never feel like it is too long.  I expect most people who watch this movie to find themselves inspired by William Wallace, and I expect most people will appreciate modern life after observing the difficulties of medieval times.  I don't plan on writing a summary of the movie--why spoil it?  I highly recommend this movie, which, 10 years later, is still my favorite movie.
B003X73QA8|3.0|I picked up this album based on other Amazon reviews and the recommendation of some folks I trust.  And I am disappointed.<br /><br />After numerous listens - at work, in the car, at home, with/without headphones - I find the album to be completely mediocre.  None of the songs stick in my head, encourage me to sing along, or generate any emotion.<br /><br />Arcade Fire definitely demonstrates good musicianship - harmonies, tempo, arrangements, etc - so it's disappointing that I keep wanting to skip to the next track in the hope that I will hear something interesting.<br /><br />I'd rate the songs at 2 stars, but an overall 3 stars due to the band's not-so-obvious-on-this-album musical skills.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|The first book I've completely read on my new Kindle and what an eye opener! The financial devices it describes, and the recent activity leading up to the recent housing and financial crash have put a lot of the recession into perspective.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />The activities and creations of bond traders, the cluelessness (or deceit? -the author sometimes leaves either version as possible) of the traders' managers, all combine for compelling nonfiction. And Mr. Lewis believes the incentives and lax regulation that brought on financial disaster may still be in place! Ready for another banking crisis and recession?<br /><br />Through sometimes annoying, but probably necessary repetition, the author describes the structure, functions, and statistics of selling short, betting on failure to make enormous profits. And how at first just a few odd personalities stumbled onto the discovery of these odd ways of creating potentially huge gains, on the one hand, or at worst, incurring rather painless losses: the ideal bet, skewed in the direction of huge profits.<br /><br />The book has inspired me, and probably many others, into exploring more about the genesis of the financial disaster; I've even recently downloaded a free copy of the \\"Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission\\" report, after reading that Michael Lewis would not put his signature on the report! Hmm...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I almost didn't purchase this book because it was listed as a \\"young adult\\" book, and those type of books are usually geared more toward 12 to 16 year olds.

B002U3CBZM|5.0|Purchased on kindle and could not put it down. The best new sci fi novel I have read in years. Morgan creates a dark yet compelling version of the world which I found riveting from start to finish.    Interesting concepts, likeable yet flawed characters and fast paced storytelling.
0316010669|4.0|Mr. Gladwell explores in detail the nuances of first impressions and the split-second decisions we make based on those first impressions. This his second book which was followed by Outliers - which focused on how those we consider excellent become excellent - this book focuses on how snap judgments can oftentimes be absolutely correct judgments. It also delves into how sometimes snap judgments can be horribly wrong and even at times deadly.      My opinion:      After reading Mr. Gladwell's third book Outliers and being extremely impressed Blink only goes on to solidify Mr. Gladwell's reputation for excellent research woven into intriguing storytelling. If you ever wondered if your \\"hunch\\" about someone was right...Gladwell shows proof that often times it is in fact correct. I enjoyed this book for the most part but at times the truth that Gladwell exposes raises concern; especially to someone whom, like Gladwell, shares ancestors from the African continent and thus is exposed to many snap judgments that are not helpful to the one being judged simply because of the color of one's skin. That being said, the book gives the reader many reasons to \\"trust their gut\\" while also giving situations when it might be a better idea to second-guess said \\"gut\\".
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I've been listening to this cd all week and love it.  I have all of Joe's music and have seen him live on a couple of occasions, but have been disappointed with the last couple of CD's.  They didn't seem to offer the type of crying blues or melodic blues (not sure how to phrase it) where you feel like getting up and playing air guitar in the dark (for all of you closet blues rock stars, of which I am one).  This CD comes out of the gate ripping.  There are about 5-6 tunes that I listen to over and over where he's just out of control (in an awesome way).  In my opinion, it's probably his best CD.  I hope he continues on this path. However, if you get a chance to see him live, it's a must for any blues/rock guitar fan.  There's a huge void for this type of music nowadays as the radio has forgotten true talent. Joe brings it all back home live.
0679731725|5.0|How many of us have traveled by plane or train on a long trip cross country and in passing the time without a cell phone, computer, or any need to do anything at all, have stared out through the window and just let our thoughts move wherever our conscious takes them?  Many little things come back to us:  things that we had done, forgot to do, purposely did not do, but now seems that we should have.  Imagine that your duties and training did not allow for such meandering thought but once in your lifetime.  How would those thoughts unfold?  This is the premise of The Remains of the Day and it is a wonderful diversion to lose oneself into.<br /><br />If I were to tell you that a most wonderful story about the societal changes in England was written by a Japanese author through a butler's eyes as he takes a seven day journey the English countryside, you might think me mad.  But that is exactly what I am going to tell you.  Ishiguro brings a classic flair to this novel that sets the reader back into the chair and then catapults him/her into an era that most of us have never entered.  The dignified butler of Darlington Hall, Mr. Stevens, relates his high and low points through a powerful story of his employ to the grand lords of Great Britain.  The story is precise, the dialogue is genuine and the atmosphere is thick with cigar smoke from the drawing room.<br /><br />The story is told present day in 1956, but quickly flashes back to the time of the Great War's treaty and then through a series of memoir-like stories, Mr. Stevens tells his life's story.  The differences between the lord of Darlington Hall and the current owner, an American, are larger than life.  And the adaptation that a great butler must make between the styles manifests the societal differences that moved through England in this same time frame.  How that butler comes to grip with a life unfulfilled is quite extraordinary.  The pain is real but it flashes only for a moment.<br /><br />The author also brings out some very subtle philosophical issues of the day through the story.  For instance in 1936 there was an exchange between Mr. Stevens and his lordship, Lord Darlington about whether the Brits were again behind the Americans in attempting to move their Democracy to a more Elitist run government.  Lord Darlington goes on to state that in today's world, the common man would have no idea how to contribute to the decisions of the world leaders and therefore they should not have any say.  Mr. Stevens, remembers this line of conversation as he stays overnight in a small town that lost many young men in the two World Wars.  They argue that dignity is the freedom of the common man to help in the decision making and direction of their country.  This of course counters the thoughts of Lord Darlington.  The conflict then sets up Mr. Stevens for some serious and not very comfortable life thoughts.  This is powerful stuff from a story about a butler on a seven day vacation.<br /><br />And of course, there is a very subtle romance story behind all of this thinking.  In this one, Ishiguro hits a home run.btle philosophical issues of the day through the story.

1400049628|2.0|I can't remember laughing once reading this book.  It is a decent horror book and the stories in the back are an okay read, but the bulk of the book is a waste of time.  I hope that people don't take the book serious.  In one chapter he describes that cooking and excercising should be done in the basement only to later tell you to hide upstairs and chop up the stairs so zombies can't get you.

B004S8NBDI|4.0|The Strokes burst onto the scene with the ultra-hip debut album \\"Is This It\\" in 2001, and it seems their punishment for being popular and cool from the start is that every album since will be overanalyzed and critically picked apart like a carcass on the savannah. Their second album, \\"Room on Fire\\", was critically underwhelming, though the years since have improved the general consensus. \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" seemed to be the straw that broke The Strokes' back, however, as it was critically panned as an album made by a band that had lost the magic. So The Strokes went on hiatus, solo and side project albums were released to generally positive reviews (Julian Casablancas' solo effort, \\"Phrazes for the Young\\", was particularly excellent), and now The Strokes are back.<br /><br />Much has been made of the recording process, where much of the album was recorded in fragmented pieces, a guitarist laying tracks down all alone, Julian Casablancas writing and recording lyrics at a different location, giving the band only vague direction from afar in an attempt to force himself out of leading the creative process. Some band members were fine with the shift, others weren't, and generally the story of the album has been more about the peculiar way they went about recording it, and the return of the band to making music together, than the music itself.<br /><br />With all of that baggage, it's easy to be pensive about this release, but there's no need. The Strokes have grown as individual musicians and songwriters, but they haven't changed much, and this album sounds like the perfect bridge between the '80s-flavored \\"Room on Fire\\" and the more turgid, swirling soundscape of \\"First Impressions of Earth\\", a sentiment made by bassist Nikolai Fraiture.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" boils down The Strokes' entire career of sounds into one punchy, adventurous song, while \\"Call Me Back\\" sounds like the distant, better cousin of \\"Ask Me Anything\\", from \\"Impressions.\\" \\"Gratisfaction\\" is The Strokes as filtered through Thin Lizzy, and \\"Machu Picchu\\" calls back the influence of bands like The Cars, who obviously made a big imprint on the quintet.<br /><br />Instead of a sprawling 14-track album that gives listeners more room to poke and prod, \\"Angles\\" offers up only ten tracks. The songs are generally in the three to four-minute range, that comfortable range for most pop music. The album doesn't take very many risks, but for fans of The Strokes, that sound, that mix of disaffection, punk, and synth-pop, married to undeniably hooky choruses, syncopated drumbeats, fractured guitars, and the occasional soar of Julian Casblancas' wounded vocals, it should be enough.<br /><br />\\"Angles\\" isn't a statement, a declaration of war or solidarity or defiance. It's just another album from The Strokes. Like the ones that came before, it's a thoroughly enjoyable album, and definitely one of the best from the still-new year. It's meant to be enjoyed for what it is, and it succeeds quite well.ions.\\" \\"Gratisfaction\\" is The Strokes as filtered through Thin Lizzy, and \\"Machu Picchu\\" calls back the influence of bands like The Cars, who obviously made a big imprint on the quintet.<br /><br />Instead of a sprawling 14-track album that gives listeners more room to poke and prod, \\"Angles\\" offers up only ten tracks.

B004A8ZWTW|4.0|I have enjoyed most movie adaptations of Jane Eyre, because the story is so stunning.  This adaptation is especially worth seeing if you've never seen the BBC Masterpiece Classic Theatre movie done for PBS.  But once you've seen the Masterpiece Classic version released in 2007, all others pale in comparison...it set a standard that will be difficult to overcome.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|I'm a big fan of Robert Plant and love his voice.  But this CD is just ok.  I enjoy it, but I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it.  Not very upbeat, feels kinda slow and sometimes monotone.  One or two songs have really caught me, but the rest just sort of fade into the background.  I felt similarly about his album with Alison Kraus . . . some parts feel like they are dragging on a bit.
0590129279|5.0|Without doubt this is (for me) the most beautiful, and perhaps the saddest book ever written. It speaks to the child in us; once this child is dead, we are dead. It is also about 'indirect communication', made so much of by Kierkegaard, long before Saint-Exupéry. No matter how knowledgeable we become, she should never lose sight that \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\"
B004LFO0FG|5.0|LOVE EVERY SONG, GREAT,, I WILL BE USING TO DANCE FOR MY MAN.. LOL. GREAT SONGS. AND THE MUSIC IS GOOD TOO..<br />VERY HAPPY I BOUGHT IT..I HOPE OTHERS WILL TOO...

6302787068|4.0|The movie was in really good condition.  My daughter has watched it numerous times and that automatically makes it worthwhile.  It came in a timely mattter, much quicker than I thought and was quite enjoyable.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Magnificent adult drama, I am waiting to own season II and will reserve it now.  My friends are thrilled about the series....
0783226845|2.0|Hard to believe they gave the Oscar to Al on this one. The lines are forced and jilty. I caught a couple spots of dialogue that are \\"setups\\"....a tactic I hate MOST in a movie, be it dialog, plot whatever. For example, Charlie says \\"I don't use it\\" when Frank asks him what he drinks. Frank responds \\"What use is it?\\". Horrible setup. You don't hear people say \\"I don't \\"use\\" alcohol\\". They made Charlie say it so Frank could deliver his line.  He sounds like (G.C. Scott's) Leach in Rescuers Down Under...which is fine!...for The Rescuers...not Al Pacino and an Oscar award. I believe Al is capable of delivering his lines in a more natural way while still retaining his challenging, bitter and eccentric attitude. He just didn't do it. O'Donnell is fine as a gullible dweeb. Frank's family visit is a bit of a mystery, they know how he is, but seemed to get easily offended.     The movie is okay...certainly will make you think a little bit. I would expect just a little bit more from Al..but maybe it's just me.

142311339X|5.0|Beware! If you have not read...SPOILERS below !!      The Lost Hero is a great book, it's about a 13 year-old boy named Jason who finds out he's a demigod, a person who has one god parent and one mortal parent, his dad is Zeus. Greek mythology is real in this book, all the events and all the people are real. This is a sequel to the Lightning Thief series, For those of you who have read the LT series and are looking for that next book to come out than this is for you. Percy Jackson has gone missing shortly after leading (and winning) the 2nd Titan War. They end The Last Olympian with Percy winning the 2nd Titan War. Then in The Lost Hero he has gone missing and the giant, Enceladus, has captured Hera, queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, women and birth. None of the other gods can save her because the force imprisoning her is stronger than them.  Jason doesn't know that the world is about to break out into war until a while into the book. It begins when he wakes up on a bus with a girl he doesn't even know holding his hand... They then get attacked viciously by venti, evil storm spirits, and from there more and more is revealed when they're rescued and put into Camp Half-Blood.     I have enjoyed this book very much as I have the last series he wrote. If you enjoyed those too, I recommend starting this book. The second one will be out soon, I canNot wait for it to see what happens.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is so much fun . I can't believe it was free. the birds make funny sounds and fly away when you save them .
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|A fine record, with an \\"album\\" feel--it's not a collection of singles.  A strong groove on \\"Discoverer\\" starts things off well, and \\"Oh My Heart\\" and \\"It Happened Today\\" are quite beautiful.  The second half has a great groove as well, though I'm not taken with the Brando song as much as some other reviewers.  The most important thing is to reserve judgment initially.  The record didn't sink in until about five listens, but now I'd rank it somewhere in the upper half of REM's records, maybe as their fifth or sixth best (Murmur will always be at the top, with Reckoning a close second).  I've listened to the band from their start in the early 80s, so I have perspective.  This record is considerably better than Accelerator, which was much less consistent, much more disjointed.
014241543X|5.0|I saw this book on NPR's list of good books to read. I read it all in two days. I felt like it was my family and that I was the one waiting in the E.R. I laughed and cried in this book and I can't wait to read the next one. Def an autor I will keep reading
B003UESJFG|5.0|There are professionals who can post better comments than 'This is a must-see!' or some other inanity. This is as good as Despicable me and comes closest to the landmark movie that raised the bar to being 'The best animated movie of the 21st century: The Incredibles.'
B004MC0FO8|2.0|I love the concept of this application and think it works great for the average music fan.  It easily identifies popular songs that I know but I began to try using it because I ripped over 1000 albums in order to put a very large collection on a hard drive for a friend so he could put it on an ipod and join the 21st century.  I was hoping that this app would help me with parts of the collection because I was completely unfamiliar with the entire Genre I was importing.  Unfortunately it was not successful identifying any music I needed to label.  I appologize to the developers if Rock was not meant to be identified but if it was none of the tracks I tried worked.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I have had this item for 4 days now.  I cannot get it to work.  I have contacted the manufacturer (NOT the seller).  When I first received the item, I placed the rechargeable battery in my Magic Mouse and placed the Magic Mouse on the charging bed.  25+ hours later it was still charging.  According to manufacturer, it should take no more than 5 hours to fully charge.  When I contacted the manufacturer, I was told to remove the battery pack from the mouse and try charging that alone.  It charged.  However, when I replace the battery pack in the mouse, the mouse does not turn on.    I seems to me there is a design flaw in the battery pack/cover that prevents proper contact with the appropriate contacts heads.  I am still trying to work this out with the manufacturer.  So far, very disappointing.  Will update when a final resolution is achieved.

0756404738|5.0|Great book, really fantastic!!   Also, the book arrived soon and in a good shape, worth to buy it from here
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I actually loved Up, but the band started losing me with Reveal and then completely lost me with Around The Sun. Then Accelerate came out and I fell in love with REM all over again. Amazingly, Collapse Into Now has eclipsed Accelerate in my opinion. I just love this album. I don't really care if they haven't charted new territory with this album; these are just great songs by a great band. Seriously, what's wrong with being who you are? I listen to music for enjoyment. If REM sounds like what we expect them to sound like, then what's the problem? The people who complained when REM started experimenting with new sounds are the same people who complain that they haven't done anything innovative on their last two albums. The band can't win with these people so I say ignore them! The thing I really like about this album is that I can actually relate to the lyrics. Michael Stipe is one of the smartest musicians out there, but often times his lyrics can be quite oblique; especially with the older albums. With Collapse Into Now, I really feel the words. I'm so glad that the older bands like REM are still making music because \\"modern music\\" just doesn't do anything for me. Thank God for REM!
B0043VCPW8|1.0|I agree with all the die hard fans(which i am have all of his cd's) that have posted. This release is the result of boredom and dollar signs. i sick of getting cd's where the artist is so bored with their beloved material that they have to re-invent it! Sorry Bryan, i love u man. just wish u did more rock n roll again like, Waking Up the Neighbors
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Bringing such extraordinary talent together for this production was magnificent. I only wish there was a companion CD. Every moment was pure bliss.
B004FQKY5Q|1.0|Ok i have been a roxette fan since \\"The look\\". i have bough every album. but at what point did they forget about there american fans. i see new cd's com out but they are all imports. whats the deal and does anyone ever remembering a tour here in north america. i just picked up the rox box which was an awsome collection of all the hits plus some other great music. plus some awsome dvd's .intresting thing is it talks alot about the joyride tour and Per says and I Qoute .\\" we have been everywhere but not  north america whats the deal with that. So after all these years i'm still a fan . and again i have to pay a an impot price to get there new cd. and from the looks of it not a tour in north america. but hey south america has got some bookings. Roxette \\"love your music but what do u have against your american fan?\\". for years i have wanted to see u guys live so whats the deal. i support u buy your cd's, is it to much to ask to see u in concert.
B004I4H8QI|4.0|this version:40th anniversary, is the way it sounded on the record (I had it on vinyl), but WAY cleaner.  This is a good remaster of the album vs. the 20th anniversary version was a remix that didn't sound like the original record.  The drum & piano and vocals sound clean while the guitars maintain their grit without it effecting the other instruments.  older versions (cds and the record) sounded like everything was squished together  and the distortion from the guitars bled into everything else.  So this version is very nice.  I can easily distinguish all the guitars separately, not squished together.    This album is Blues with lots of stratocaster guitar through Tube amps.  lots of bluesy  licks and solos done by Eric Clapton and Duane Allman playing slide.  Lyrics are heartfelt, true story about falling in love with his best friends girlfriend.  This is a \\"classic\\" rock  Album.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|funcionan perfectamente para lo que son, conectar el cable y que no quede hacia afuera o forzado, seria mejor si no costaran tanto pero en caso
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It might be simple but it's a lot of fun and that's all that matters. Plus it looks like arcade mode has been added. Works Great on Optimus S.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I haven't really enjoyed any of the movies since PoA.  I have read the books many times and I really dislike all of the changes in the Harry Potter movies.  That said, I thought Deathly Hallows pt. 1 was very well done and we enjoyed it immensely.  It's my favorite of the movies so far.  They added a lot of the emotional depth in the movie and it was well paced.  I'm glad they didn't leave too much out, though I missed the Dursley's goodbye scene.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Could be a kinda fun game, but there's so much lag between the finger swipe and ninja slice that it's more like Fruit Juggler. My droid X should be able to keep up with anything, especially fruit.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|it continuously force closes as soon as i turn it on. sucks b/c it looks cool:( if they could fix this problem i would be so happy and reinstall
B002L9N4DS|5.0|I will keep this brief, as I will presume that everyone is familiar with this classic movie and epic performance by Tom Hanks (who is a genius). If you have been living under a rock or perhaps have been cut off from civilization over the past decade or so, or just haven't gotten around to watching this wonderful movie, the synopsis provided by Amazon.com will suffice as to the films subject matter. As for the two-disc Blu-Ray, it's nothing short of awesome, after all everything is better in High Definition.
0316069485|2.0|First, I've long been a fan of Michael Connelly's writing, and specifically his earlier Harry Bosch tales; all of which were great.  And so I bought \\"The Reversal\\" since it featured Harry Bosch. But the main player was lawyer Mickey Haller.  I don't like lawyers as a rule, and I certainly don't like the character Haller that Connelly has developed.  In addition, Connelly has now taken what once was a TERRIFIC, hard case cop, Harry Bosch and turned him into a politically correct, \\"reformed anti-smoker\\" wuss!  Well guess what Mr. Connelly?  I'll not spend any more money on your books until I see you return Harry Bosch back in time to the days when he was a great cop. Keep your lawyers and stories thereof.  This title was a huge disappointment to me, a longtime Connelly fan! :(
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|This is my least favorite KR album ever. RnR Jesus was my favorite. I just don't understand why he let Rick Rubin take so much control here. The backing band on this album is sub-par in my opinion (although I'm a huge Chad Smith fan) and I think TBT would have done a way better job here. I feel like the song-writing on this album is really bad, and it is just very watered-down and over produced in general. Seems like there are way too many suits with their hands in Kid Rock's cookie jar these days.     The bottom line is, there is nothing that stands out to me about this album, other than it will probably be his least memorable and least listened to album over the years. Not that it's all bad..there are a couple good tracks here.. but like I said, those tracks could have been amped WAY up if TBT was the backing band.    Very let down. I'm all for an artist growing and trying different things, but this was just way too squeaky clean, polished, and forced.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent game, lots of fun and I love the new graphics. Works great on my myTouch 4g. I can't wait for the remaining levels.
B004R0WKNE|3.0|I love the beautiful Diane Keaton.  Her style, timing, and delivery are nearly perfect.  I'll watch her in almost anything.<br /><br />I used to think the same thing about Harrison Ford.  However, Morning Glory isn't one to keep his reputation going for me.<br /><br />Ford's attempt at the curmudgeonly 'star' wasn't interesting.  Yes, he was supposed to be irritating--and he was--but my irritation wasn't so much with his character, but with his performance.  Mostly, he appeared to have recently sucked on sour citrus to maintain the pinched angry appearance.  It's not a good look for him.<br /><br />At the end, I was left with questions about why/how Angela Lansbury was supposed to be the worst there is.
B001QWBM62|4.0|After a few unsuccessful attempts to get clean audio from my DSLR I decided to find a compact alternative that would give me high quality digital recording without breaking the bank.  I use a wireless lavaliere mic and a room mic for my interviews and being able to connect directly to the Zoom via XLR and adjust each channel individualy (which was added with the recent firmware update 1.72) is a godsend. I purchased a 8GB SD card which gives me over 11 hours of record time at 16bit 48kHz stereo. I remember the days of having to record on DAT which wasn't cheap and definately could not be stored in your pocket. The cons are cosmetic but not game changing.  The jog wheel is small as well as the tiny menu button.  It would have been nice to get a Camera Shoe included.  All in all I highly recommend for the DSLR/Video Shooter on the go.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i absolutely love this app. If my wireless is on the book syncs to the last page read. It's like a small version of Kindle. Love it!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I feel in love with this movie the first time I saw it as a teen-ager!  All-time classic love story of good girl falling for the rebel!!  The music takes me back to when I was a kid listening to my parents 45 records with my sisters too.  So glad to finally own it on DVD!!
1416583432|5.0|Excellent for experienced or novice dog owners...or ones to be. I found this in NYT Book Reviews & took their word for the value of this tome. It did not disapoint.
B0018LX9T4|1.0|this is about two people who belong in a psychiatric ward. When insanity is mistaken for love. Far from funny. Disturbing that writers come up with such a script. Maybe it's their way to deal with their own insanity. There should be a certain truth to any story. This story is not believable and far from interesting. File under garbage bin.<br />this was a total waste of time. It's amazing that most people here give it such a high ranking. Big bag of zero.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Warning: This game is very addictive.  Especially when you can fit in a game in a minute I find myself pulling this out for a quickie whenever I've got a minute to spare.  For a while that has been reserved for Doodlejump but I'm finding this to be more challenging, entertaining, and addictive.    I like the three game modes.  I play classic when I have some spare time and I want to out-do myself.  A game still only takes a couple of minutes.  Zen and arcade mode are great when I've only got a couple of minutes to spare.    The graphics are great, and I like the simple sound effects. My only complaint is that, at times, the gameplay will stagger a little bit which can throw off accuracy.  I've got an Evo 4g so it should handle this with no problems.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Application not installed is the only message I have after dowload. I can install the windows software but not the app. So, I guess I just loose 5$.
1439107955|5.0|I have a son and a dear friend who have gone through cancer treatment and I needed to know as much as I could about this frightful disease. Dr.Mukherjee admirably achieves the goal of explaining the essence of cancer in a manner that informs, amuses and,at times, horrifies.His detailed exploration of the dedication of scientists to relentlessly pursue a \\"cure\\" lifts their efforts to Elysian fields   (I'd prefer not to have you use my name)
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|Was looking forward to this, given the talented cast and reviews I had read.  What a disappointment! So much potential, but this was just silly, cliche and extremely predictable.  Looked like they had fun making this movie...glad somebody did.
B0000026UV|5.0|Anybody who knows anything about guitar will delight in every cut on this album. Knopfler declines to bury Atkins in a wave of his monster technique. But just LISTEN to the interplay, the incredibly subtle, nuanced, uber-perfect harmonics, the unmatched  virtuosity, the lyricism, and the joy these two bring to this mutual-respect tour-de-force. If this is elevator music it must be the elevator at the Guitar Hall of Fame, or maybe the elevator to heaven. This album is mellow, and charming, but it is about as lightweight as a cubic foot of plutonium. This is the all-time best album in the huh? those two made an album? category. Frankly, if you don't smile at this album you probably never will.
0060558121|5.0|Gaimen blends religions and cultures together with poignant characters and masterful story telling. This is one of the most memorable books I have read. Scenes and passages are so vivid and cutting that the are burned into the mind's eye. A luckless Everyman is thrust into a fantastic world where the gods walk among us, and work their machinations and intrigues in the against the canvas of an oblivious modern world. Gods make the rules, but they don't always play by them, after all isn't that the whole point of being a god?
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I watched this the other night, and while its not awful, I'm not sure why everyone is finding it so dramatic or great.  Yes, her acting is good, but the story itself is not; i actually found it to be very blah and wanted it to end soon after it started. I don't see how this is a psychological thriller... she's just messed up, nothing thrilling about that. Now that I have seen this, I truly believe Nicole Kidman should have won an Oscar for Rabbit Hole - much better story and very dramatic with superb acting all the way around.
140130916X|5.0|This is a great story. It is hard to read because the way the story is told you and completely enveloped in the characters and your heart breaks right along with hers. At least this also means that when she perserveres you cheer her on like you are one of her family members or best friends. Just make sure you keep the kleenex close.
0061353248|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers that the material is thought provoking and can be used in many cases to understand behavior ... but I'm not so convinced with the research.     I find the chapter on arousal somewhat dubious. Not that anyone should be at all surprised that behavior changes in an aroused state (you're more likely to have road rage when your heart is pumping because you are late than when you are just taking a leisurely drive). I actually have two issues. First, there is a difference between answering a question and actually doing something. The fact that someone said they would do something in an excited state doesn't mean they would. Has anyone ever said \\"if I catch my spouse cheating I'll kill them?\\" Sure but fortunately most people don't. Asking a teenager if they'd date a 60 year old woman doesn't get a big reaction because they would never think of it. It makes for an interesting story but it doesn't actually prove the action. If this were the case then we better be careful of people playing violent video games because isn't this likely to cause the same change in behavior? The second problem is the statistics. Again, the data is not accurate. When you have a set sample of 100 people and one answer changes from 10 to 25 (15 people = 150%) and another one changes from 55 to 70 (15 people = 27%) which number is more important? In both cases 15 people changed their minds (15% of the group). The largest increase in the group was 29% and the smallest was 6% but in terms of percent difference the numbers go from 18 to 420 which look more significant. The last table is even worse since it shows numbers in many cases going down which means if an answer goes from 70 to 55 (15 people = 21%) it will under represent the sample. I'm not sure what the purpose of showing the data in this example was since we don't get charts in others. It makes me feel that this experiment was more to get a reaction from the reader.     Besides didn't you already provethe arousal theory with the Filene's Basement story? Seemingly rational people become completely irrational when the door opens. They act in ways they would never have predicted had you tested them ahead of time.     You want to test a good behavior? How about those people who say if they won a million dollars they'd give most of it away? Easy to say until you have it. How about the people who complain about all those executives making big bucks but have no problem with athletes and actors making tens of millions a year? How about parents who rationalize buying their kids expensive cell phones?     THe book is thought provoking and I was expecting to like it more than I did. I enjoyed \\"Influence\\" far more and feel it has more valuable content.
0307276902|5.0|I wish I could say that I read this before Oprah had it on her book club but I can't. I picked up this book because I saw her introduce this book as a book club pick. That is where Oprah and I start to drift apart. She was totally right in picking this book as a club pick....she wasn't however in calling out an author on national TV and ripping his entire life apart. I am sorry but there is no reason for it. He gave us as reader an insight into a feeling. This was not a documentary type of book....it was meant to express feelings and evoke feelings and I think James Frey is a wonderful writer and a courageous person. If you have not been to a treatment center or known someone that has had an addiction problem and/or has been in a treatment center (and I have) this is a perfect description of the feelings, the type of people and the types of daily activities that go on....no, maybe not exactly or factually 100% but, is life?! People can look at the same painting and see things totally different. People can go on an adventure together and have the exact same series of events happen to them and they describe them completely different, so who are we to say if he is telling the factual truth or if he is sharing his point of view based on feelings and experiences. Also, please take into account the fact that an addict entering treatment is often so lost in their addiction that most of the time they cannot recall many of the first hours, days or even weeks of their time in treatment. Please give this book a chance...It is a gripping and blunt story of many people in our country that go though the darkness of addiction.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|I love this app on my iPod touch, and when I saw it on here, I had to have it. It works the same as the iOS version, but it's lagging on my Droid Incredible pretty good. It's hardly playable and it's suppose to have more RAM than the touch and it ran fine on there. Please, fix the lag and I'll give you five stars =)
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I don't understand why this game is popular, the game modes get old fast,  extras are pointless color changes etc,  and online top scores gotta be hacked
0061726826|5.0|this is one of those situations in which I cannot speak eloquently about a book for the life of me. This book is SO good. Amazing, actually. I loved it, loved it, LOVED IT.    Where do I start? The characters in this novel are just fantastic. What I loved about Lena is the fact that she is such a \\"normal\\" teen. She is not a revolutionary, she has not spent years plotting to overthrow the government, she is not angry about her life. She is happy with things, and although she misses her mother (who committed suicide because of the Deliria) she knows that as soon as she is cured, those feelings will disappear. It is not until she meets Alex where she begins to question everything. Now some readers might think that this makes her weak, since she changed her entire outlook for a boy, but I just thought it rang true. Most people, in any given situation that they have been in their entire lives, simply accept things. People don't think to question the system until they are confronted with evidence that the system is flawed, which is exactly what happened to Lena when she met Alex. Then she finally had a reason to think critically about her world.    The other wonderful thing about this novel is how well-thought-out the world Oliver created is. She really made everything come alive for me, and it is clear that she analyzed every single detail so that the reader would have no questions about how everything \\"worked\\". I found it so interesting to think about all the little ways that love matters in our lives and how taking it away would have huge consequences. In the novel, music is not appreciated, people don't really care about their pets, and there is no empathy for another person's plight, among other things. It was just an expertly crafted novel, overall.    I am beyond excited for the next two books in this exciting trilogy - I have very high hopes for this series, as I truly loved this novel.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|One of the really few films in some time that is worth the viewing. Spellbinding and beautifull acted by Ms. Portman. She deserves the Oscar.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I have to disagree with every one who said that this movie was not sci-fi. If you pay attention when Kaiden is using that Infomation device after he crashes, when it is describing the planet earth. It says that earth was an abandand seed colony this goes right along with the ancient alien theory, that the the human race was created by aliens thousands of years ago as a slave race. I know it's just a theory but it make for good film making and yes it was not a full on sci-fi flick but to say it wasn't sci-fi at all is false. It was a great blend of sci-fi, fantasy, action and drama. And another thing so what if it had some cheesy parts sometimes a little cheese is good for a movie, but just the right amount.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was an excellent movie!  We have enjoyed watching it more than once.  The story is exciting and uplifting.  We appreciate the good deals that we find on Amazon.
0316098337|1.0|When I read the description of this book I was so excited to read the book itself! There was so much potential for it to be interesting, compelling, juicy, creepy, scary, hopful, inspiring. It was none of it! The first few pages, I kept waiting to be \\"pulled in\\". It never happened. Because the book is told from the point of view of a 5 year old child -it quickly went from annoying to tedious to just painful. I could not wait for it to end. It would have been awesome if one chapter was written from the childs viewpoint, then the next from the mothers viewpoint, and if you want to really go there, a chapter from \\"old Nick's' viewpoint.

0525423273|5.0|Oh good heavens, this novel was amazing. I don't have adequate words to describe it. I read this book in one sitting, and even though at 1:31 AM my lips felt numb from reading out loud (as I do with really good books), my eye's were all crossy and unable to focus, and my brain felt detached from my body, I didn't want this book to end...ever. I actually thrust the book into my chest and hugged it giggling. And then I cried a little, and then I laughed again. Yes, it was very crazy personish and I was glad that no one in my house was awake to witness it.   Seriously, if you don't own this book yet, go buy it right now. I almost want to go purchase one... or three more copies for myself just to have them, that's how great this book is. My only complaint? \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" is now my standard in which to compare all other books in the future. It will be hard to measure up to this book.    Happy reading,    B

B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is amazing. The graphics are outstanding and look fantastic on my Evo 4g. My wife and I are completely addicted to it! Thanks Amazon for making this free, but I would have bought it as well.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|I love this movie... it's sexual, twisted, funny, dark and James Spader is in it! That's worth five stars right? Yes it is but the transfer to blu is not. It's not as bad as some transfers (run lola run comes to mind...) but it could've used some more work. I noticed quite a bit of jitter and a lot of grain (which I understand is sometimes intended by the cinematographer and or director... ie 'predator'). I'm talking black and white 1940's Criterion Collection grain. Also there was a bit of debris on the film that they could've cleaned up.   If you already have the dvd its about the same as the blu (i used to own it on dvd) if jitter bothers you there is none on the dvd. If you must own it on blu this review is probably not going to change your mind. I personally would've just saved a few dollars and gotten the dvd (again) knowing what I know now.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have to say I didn't know whether I would like this movie.  I was very disapointed with the princess and the frog.  This one is amazing and is one I easily add to my favorites of all time!  I never got bored and the animation is beautiful.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|i am really disppointed in the quality of the android version. It is so laggy on my Thunderbolt that it is unplayable. My iPod version has no such issues along with a ton more features, achievements, rewards AND multiplayer. I love this game, ive purschased it twice. This version needs some serious love and a fat update.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Ive seen all the Evangelion movies and the series and this is a AWESOME movie for evagelion fans, more actions and ne angels with better effects and the cg makes it look awesome... the eva fights look way better simply any Eva fan will love it
0393068382|5.0|Cordelia Fine's \\"Delusions of Gender\\" has been making the rounds among the literati and the general public interested in popular science alike, and with good reason. Her work is the much-needed answer to all the explicitly or implicitly sexist nonsense peddled in the domain of popular science nowadays and a breath of fresh air after all the pseudoscientific screeds along the lines of \\"Men are from Mars, Women from Venus\\" etc. Fine, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne, wrote this work out of frustration with the proliferation of such books, and a fine counterblast it is. With humor, insight, and a knack for making complicated issues obvious and appealing, she systematically demolishes the case for understanding gender differences in culture and society as the immediate result of 'inherent' brain functioning or hardwired evolutionary patterns.<br /><br />Fine's book discusses priming, that is how women perform worse when reminded of womanhood rather than of some other trait or none at all, as well as stereotype threat, the phenomenon when women are reminded of particular stereotypes adhering to their identity as such and this undermines their performance also. These issues are not just important for gender discrimination and exclusion, but also for racism in testing and recruitment. She discusses the way in which, often inadvertently, various cultural and subcultural elements in everything from big business to computer science recruitment are set up in a way that unnecessarily discourages and presumes against female participation. Following that, she considers in depth the many studies that have been done in social psychology on test differences between men and women as well as the meaning and nature of studies done on the basis of PET and fMRI scans of the brain, and the habitual nature of wildly overinterpreting them in favor of patriarchal conclusions on the part of both some neo-sexists like Baron Cohen and the Pinkers as well as popular science journalists. She shows how most 'innate' test differences disappear when the tests are set up differently and correct for preconceived notions and priming. Another major part of the book is concerned with gender differences in babies and young children, and the supposed confirmation of the thesis that gender differences are large and innate and have immediate social consequences following from the repeated failures by individual parents to raise their children 'gender-free'. As Fine points out, the chances of succeeding at that on your own in such a heavily genderized society as ours are virtually zero, so that's not very surprising. But as she discusses at length, the evidence actually strongly indicates that gender identification and segregation is learned behavior of young children (albeit at a very young age indeed), reinforced often unwittingly by parents and supervisors, not an innate phenomenon; this goes even for choice of toys and play partners. Finally, the book spends some - though perhaps not enough - time on discussing evolutionary psychology and its modular brain thesis and the way in which this misrepresents how the brain works in favor of an imaginary, retroactive patriarchal interpretation of human behavior. This bit has been done more in depth in the work of David Buller and Valerie Hardcastle, [[ASIN:0262524600 Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature (Bradford Books)]].<br /><br />Given the prevalence of these notions about how women and men's behavior really are innately and predeterminedly different across the board in society and the manner in which, since the 1970s, the gradual acceptance of this new 'scientific sexism' has created a counterrevolution against gender equality, it is of the utmost importance that as many people as possible read this excellently written book. Fine writes with subtlety and humor and will not turn off any reader even remotely inclined to objectivity. The next time somefalse concern is expressed by a condescending businessman or Harvard professor stating that he wished it weren't so that women are unsuited for maths and politics, but that one just can't argue with science, the reader of this book can now throw the real science right back at him. Real science always triumphs over human prejudice and naked self-interest, and the sciences of psychology and neurology are no different. All throughout the 19th century scientists attempted to find the inferiority of women, blacks, and other oppressed groups in their skull shape, facial angle, brain size, brain/pelvis ratio, and whatever else they could find to 'scientifically' ground their antiquated patriarchal nonsense. Today, it is genetics and neurology that play these roles. We must reclaim these sciences from the avatars of sexism and racism and in so doing free the way for good research and real social reform.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|Looking around I see a lot of people complaining about performance issues including a user using my exact phone. Let me just say that this isn't a guaranteed problem for your phone. A lot of my friends running android phones are enjoying this game, and it isn't just a badly done iPhone port. It is possible that it may lag on your phone if you are using an older one or if you have put your phone through its paces, but all in all it is a great app and a fun game.    Runs perfectly. Nexus One 2.3 Gingerbread    As for the game itself, it is very addicting and is perfect for a casual game to just pick up and play for a while if you are waiting in a lunch line or something similar. This game is well known for a reason and I'd say it is a worthy app.
B004L49K20|5.0|This album, \\"All You Need Is Now\\", is a return-to-roots triumph for Duran Duran; a precious gift to us fans; a quintessential revelation to casual listeners; and a major slap in the face to their former label Sony/Epic Records!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Awesome.. A serious modern rock n roll record. Hard and irreverent.. with some jagged kinda industrial guitars..the playing is seriously tight and smart. Like the cover art suggests it's also funny and quirky.. Havent stopped playing it since it arrived and believe it's prob their best.. Cool as..
B00142X56Y|4.0|I'm a fan of this opera. I have never been educated in classical music so my review might be very simple for most or you. I like this opera. I saw it for the first time about 20 years ago. I like the music and the arias, specially the queen of the night's \\"Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\\" which still amaze me every time I hear it, or Papageno and Papagena \\"Pa-, pa-, pa-\\" which is so playful and just set for a happy ending. The production itself, the singers are excellent, the costume for the Queen of the Night is the best I have seen (especially in blue ray), but the weird hair of the three ladies is just that, WEIRD. I like that the three boys are actually boys and not women. I said almost perfect because there is one part I don't understand; the magnificence of the costumes and the decor is completely ruined by the clothes that Papagena wears. It looks more like a joke to me and I wish that this was done in a different way, but if I close my eyes and listen, it helps to erase that image from your mind and still enjoy the opera.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I took this out of the box and my 7 month old baby was trying to scale me to get to it.  I had to wrestle him away just so I could put the stickers on.  Once I gave it to him, he attacked it viciously and played with it a good half an hour without pause.  When he did pause, it was only to crawl across the floor and back to it.  The only issue I have with it so far is that we have hardwood floors and he wants to stand all the time while holding on to things (though nowhere near steadily enough to use it in walker mode).  He likes to lean over it, holding himself up with one hand and standing on his feet while he plays with the toys on it with his free hand.  Because the wheels do not lock and we have hardwood floors, it tends to slide out from under him.  In that half an hour, he fell about 7 times.      HOWEVER... I'm not one of those mums who sheds a tear whenever my LO falls on his backside or gets a tiny bump on the head.  It's a good learning experience for him to fall down now and then, even if it does upset him.  It's certainly not the toy's fault that he wants to play with it in such a position but it WOULD be nice if locking the wheels was an option.  I'll probably just use something to jam them until he's old enough to walk with it.      He LOVES it.  Therefore, I'm pretty fond of it too.
B00127RAJY|3.0|First of all the work outs are fun, challenging, and effective.  I like the progression.  The banter is a bit annoying after a few days, but I'm starting to put on my own music or something else to listen to.    What sucks about this DVD is the long promotional intro videos which you cannot skip.  And also the long intro to work out #1.  That informational stuff should have been put on a separate segment so you don't have to listen to it every day or have to try to fast forward past it.  I want to just jump into my work out, and don't want to have to wait through all the junk at the beginning of the disc.    Would have given it 5 stars if the DVD had been edited and put together better.

HOPE RH ENDS W/ ROCK BALLADS-THE WAY THEY STARTED; never forget the ole rh. kol lp has nothing to do w/ rockstyles cuz its not rock. most rockstyle examples-alternative, classic, psych., progressive, new wave.

B001AQMBJG|5.0|I'm sure the quality of this blu-ray will be great, like the other Kubrick movies on Warner Bros. I appreciate that you didn't make us true Kubrick fans wait or buy the whole box set when the only ones missing were Lolita and Barry Lyndon. I'm an early adopter and had the other Kubrick titles since 2007. Thanks Warner Bros for releasing this stand alone blu-ray!
B0043RSJ8G|3.0|I've read every book Jodi Picoult has ever had published.  I love the skilled way she takes a contemporary issue and creates for her readers a tangled web of empathy and outrage, pause and reflection whilst endearing us to characters of depth and humanity.  I have no idea what went wrong with Sing You Home.  Just as we begin to engage with the two main characters we are hit with a series of \\"once in a lifetime\\" events which appear to happen within a 5 month (2 chapter) period.  I felt like Zoe's (the main character) life had been taken on the emotional equivalent of a Die Hard movie.  The chain of events was so bizzare and happened so fast with no attention to emotional detail, I wondered if perhaps Jodi was being pushed to release a book at this time and so took a worksheet of possible future storylines and quickly crammed them into one story.      This is by no means a bad book, by most reader's standards it is an interesting topic (well several of them and that, perhaps, is a part of it's problem) and is written in Jodi's usual style; so from that perspective her fans will find some worth in reading it.  I do feel however it lacks emotional depth and engaging characters (perhaps with the exception of Vanessa) and as such I was somewhat disappointed.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|This movie/story stands the test of time...I just recently re-watched it and was moved in a dozen different directions of emotions again.  It has the thought-provoking scenes about the good and evil of humans, and how we mistreat the hell out of each other; and how war always seems to be some sort of solution or compromise.  The acting was superb, and the Philippines are always a delight to see and visit. The music, the eery scenery and lighting added to the drama. I liked the reviews/comments afterwards that making the movie was kind of like the Vietnam War for real, i.e., anything that could go wrong, did. I am happy that<br />Martin Sheen recovered and survived, and we got to see him \\"as the President\\" in the TV series. Definitely a war movie worth seeing again.
0761119752|5.0|I love Sandra Boynton!  This book is particularly great at bedtime, I love how kids relate well to her books and love the rhymes!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This is an 8 disc set in four volumes, each volume containing a movie and special features, somewhat suitable for family viewing. The reason I say \\"somewhat\\" is that I would not recommend these movies for small children to view as some of the characters and scenes may frighten them because either they are a bit on the gruesome side or because the characters are dangling in the air high above the city, and things like that can play on a little one's fears.  Older children may not be so affected by them, though, and will probably enjoy them immensely.    These four movies are not nearly as dark as the newer ones, and compared to the newer Batman films, are much more light hearted and very enjoyable.  My opinion is that Keaton was the best Batman, but George Clooney is a close second - he didn't have the same Batman finesse but he made an awesome Bruce Wayne, where Keaton's Batman was awesome but his Bruce Wayne was far more easy going and laid back.  I enjoyed them both.    Val Kilmer's version wasn't bad, either, he was an alright Batman and an alright Bruce Wayne possessing the charm and integrity, but his look wasn't quite the same.    All in all, I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Batman.  I purchased these for Classic Cinema Online so that I can write my \\"Bat Review\\" based on Batman in Film - to include the movie serials from the 1940's, the tv series from the 1960's, and all of the Batman movies from 1966 to the most recent released, The Dark Knight, and am not one bit disappointed.  This particular set, of all the Batman movies, is my personal favorite.    It arrived on the day estimated and in excellent condition - I purchased mine new.  No complaints whatsoever.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I really like it. It lets me really see the signal strength changes in real time. Also it let me see what wifi channel would be better strength. I set up our home networks (3) with the help of this app and have nothing but positive things to say about it.
B002436WFI|4.0|Such a fun movie, great to spark some thought, but more fun than anything else.  It's just a great bit of entertainment.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is one of tose books that you can't stop reading and when you get to the end you wish it wasn't over. Rothfuss is an exceptional storyteller, with the ability to interweave all the aspects of a complex tale, without dropping a stitch. The only bad part is, now I have to wait months and months for the next book.
B00005ATQF|4.0|One of the most powerful war movies that I've ever seen, starting with USMC bootcamp and moving right into Vietnam and the savagery of war. Lee Ermey was at his best as the DI, and the lads fighting the war were courageous, united and fuctioned as team.  It's unfortunate that snipers know that marines do not leave their comrades wounded in the field, and as a result, a female Vietnamese sniper is able to wound and kill too many of the young warriors. You'll get to meet believeable characters like Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, Cowboy, and you'll get caught up in the black humor of war, and the nightmare of direct combat.  A strong movie - not for the faint-hearted.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The 'Inside Job' is the most comprehensive documentary I have watched on the Economic Crisis that unfolded in the US. It details the scheme that led to the systematic breakdown of the financial system. Learn about who benefited from this crisis and how they did so. The most interesting thing for me about this documentary was the political connections exposed. The film maker does a GREAT job of uncovering the relationships between the people making the policies governing Financial institutions and their 'board' gigs at the financial institutions which their laws greatly influenced. Also there are numerous interviews in here that are worth watching. I loved the look on the politicians faces when they realized that the interviewer had switched gears and were now pursuing their biases towards lax rules based on their position in benefiting companies. Despite the seriousness of the topic this documentary is quite entertaining. It's also very educational and a must watch.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The dead will walk, and boy do they ever.  A pitch-perfect adaptation of Robert Kirkman's Image Comics series, AMC's The Walking Dead is simply spectacular.  Georgia cop Rick (Andrew Lincoln) wakes up from a coma to find the world around him has gone straight to hell.  Flesh eating zombies are everywhere, but that doesn't stop Rick from searching for his missing wife Lori (Prison Break's Sarah Wayne Callies) and young son Carl (Chandler Riggs).  Unbeknownst to Rick however is that his partner Shane (Jon Bernthal) has things well in hand, with things getting hot and heavy between him and Lori in the process.  Produced by Frank Darabont (director of The Mist, The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile; and who also helms the pilot episode), The Walking Dead captures both the horror and human elements that make Kirkman's comic so good in the first place.  Deviations from the source material aside, this is the brilliant zombie epic we've been waiting years for.  It's scary, rightfully bloody, and features a wonderful cast that also includes Darabont regulars Jeffrey DeMunn and Laurie Holden as Dale and Andrea respectively, newcomer Steven Yuen who is excellent as Glenn, and memorable guest appearances from Norman Reedus, Michael Rooker, and Noah Emmerich.  While this first season's six episodes are based on the comic's first storyarc, things conclude in a very different manner than the comic, and it leaves things sitting on a powder keg for the upcoming second season.  Do yourself a favor, even if you've never checked out the comic, give The Walking Dead a try.  If the brilliant pilot and haunting season finale doesn't hook you, you need to check your pulse.

B002LL13BQ|4.0|This was my first opera, the one that really got me into opera, and I probably watched our VHS of it over 100 times during college (there was a span there where I was literally watching it every night). Anyway, I was really sad when we got rid of our VHS player, and had been looking for a DVD version of this particular production, which for me will always be the quintessential La Boheme, for a long time. It's so exciting to finally have it in my possession, however, when it came time to watch it, it would not work in my laptop, nor in the DVD player at school. It did work in my friend's laptop (we both have macs, but hers is slightly older).

B004KSQN7C|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Femme Fatale\\" I was floored.<br />Every song flowed on perfectly to the next and every song sounded like an undeniable smash.<br />Time has passed and I have my favourites and my least favourites but the general consensus is that \\"Femme Fatale\\" is Britney's greatest achievement to date.<br />I have always admired Britney's albums in one way or another and think they are all strong.<br />From the incredibly diverse \\"In The Zone\\" to the flawless coherent dark electronic journey of \\"Blackout\\" to 2008's wild candy coloured song hodge podge of \\"Circus\\" I have always thought Britney's strengths resided in her albums. Not her singles.<br />Anyone who has properly listened to her past 3 or 4 albums HAS to agree with me.<br /><br />She brings a great collection of songs together every time and \\"Femme Fatale\\" is no exception!<br />\\"Till The World Ends\\" sounds very generic upon first listen but a little more time with the song reveals a great party anthem that everyone can sing along to. Its a cool, fun track. I still stand by the fact its probably the most generic on the album but in saying that its easily one of the best and catchiest.<br /><br />\\"Hold It Against Me\\" is the #1 smash that everyone knows by now. Its a totally different sound for Britney but at the same time it sounds totally Britney. For a song that was meant for Katy Perry, Britney brings her own thing to it and makes it an amazing song and 1st single. I dont think this is the strongest track on the album but from the thumping opening beats to the amazing dubstep breakdown...this is one of Britney's most adventurous different songs and it was exactly what she needed to kick off the \\"Femme Fatale\\" era.<br /><br />\\"Inside Out\\" is easily one of my favourite tracks. The production is simply amazing and Britney really brings it to the song. Especially in the power chorus. While most mid-tempo 'sex' jams are quite the yawn in my mind (Rihanna, I'm looking at you) this song proved me wrong in every way and is easily one of the strongest cuts.<br /><br />\\"I Wanna Go\\" continues the streak of strong song after strong song. This is also easily one of the best songs. This song SCREAMS summer single and I hope they do release it that way! The chorus with the whistling is undeniably catchy and the actual chorus is one of the most addictive out there today. Most people were confused to why this wasn't the 1st or 2nd single..I think Team Britney are saving it for a later date to continue momentum for the album when this song burns up the charts. (At least I hope!)<br /><br />\\"How I Roll\\" is a really strange song. It sounds nothing like Britney would do yet it fits perfectly like a glove. The chorus is infectious and the production is also flawless (Thanks to the amazing dream team of Bloodshy & Avant + Britney!)<br />It sounds like it belongs on Robyn's album yet at the same time it fits perfectly in this sequence of songs.<br /><br />\\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\" is a catchy, fun song but this is where the albums amazing streak of songs begins to wean for me. Its undeniably catchy and Sabi's rap is cool but its something about the overly auto tuned chorus that kind of puts me off the song. However. everything else is pure perfection to my ears.<br /><br />\\"Seal It With A Kiss\\" is also a fun song. Its production is also very good and deserves kudos for the dubstep breakdown. After \\"Hold It Against Me\\" I was hoping they would dabble in the dubstep sound more. While there are hints of it throughout the album its probably most strong in this song.<br /><br />\\"Big Fat Bass\\" is a lot of peoples least favourite song on the album. I have to disagree. The production is super fun to listen to and the chorus is VERY infectious. The breakdown with will.i.am's verse is my favourite part. I can just imagine Britney dancing to it and it gets me moving too! It also sounds AMAZING on a big stereo with a sub woofer. I recommend listening to it that way!<br /><br />\\"Trouble For Me\\" ismy least favourite song on the album. I dont know why. The production is great and her vocals are spot on but this song does nothing for me.<br /><br />\\"Trip To Your Heart\\" was not a highlight for me when I first heard the album but now its one of my favourites. Its a sweet song and sounds very girly upon first listen but the hard hitting European dance beats made this song irresistible to me.<br /><br />\\"Gasoline\\" is a cool song. Not one of my favourites and this is the only song on the entire album where the lyrics had me cringing a bit. I could have done without this but its listenable when I'm in the mood.<br /><br />\\"Criminal\\" closes the album and it closes it perfectly. The production sounds like nothing Britney's ever done before and thats what makes this album her best. It sounds at home on Madonna's \\"American Life\\" album yet it also fits perfectly here.<br />Her vocals shine through on this song and I do really hope they release this as a single. I cant speak highly enough of this song! Perfect closer. Not quite up-tempo...not quite mid-tempo...not quite a ballad. It just is!<br /><br />The bonus songs are good but they seem very 'bonus' to me. Hence why they were probably selected as Bonus Tracks.<br />I'm glad none of these made the cut for the actual album because they don't fit 100% into the cohesiveness of the album. Especially the vocally stunning \\"He About to Lose Me\\" or the rock sounding \\"Dont Keep Me Waiting\\".<br />\\"Selfish\\" and \\"Up N Down\\" are a bit more in style of the album but there were much stronger dance songs that they used instead. These songs however make a nice little bonus once the albums over and they are fun to listen to.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Femme Fatale\\" is no doubt in my mind Britney's strongest album. Each song flows perfectly on to the next, its hard hitting and takes Britney to places she or her fans haven't seen her go before.<br />The production on the songs is simply put..Flawless and I have to congratulate Dr Luke and Max Martin for giving her a diverse sounding, yet cohesive album that stays in vein of today's popular music but is not the generic trash we hear on the radios every 2 minutes.<br /><br />4 ½ Stars!spot on but this song does nothing for me.    \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" was not a highlight for me when I first heard the album but now its one of my favourites.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I bought this watch new in 2008. I paid about $400 dollars then, and personally I think it's still worth that much or more. I chose this watch after considering many other brands which would cost two or three times as much as I paid for this Seiko, and have no regrets. It is of equal if not better quality than other brands which I considered. The watch has stood up very well. Because there is no paint or anything like that, you can hardly tell it has been worn. I did have to replace the spring in the clasp once, but that was a couple of months after I bought it and the new spring has stood up perfectly, so it must have been a lemon originally. Otherwise the strap is perfect.  Had to change the battery in 2013, so that was 5-6 years for the battery.  The lens is now a little bit worn, and could use to be replaced, but I abuse the watch I must say. I wear it every day, and work, hunt, swim and play with it.  I love this watch, and I know I'll be able to wear it for decades more because I know it will stand up to whatever I put it through.  Great buy!
0756665949|4.0|Great present for every \\"Lost\\" fan.  Something like an dictionary, alphabetical order with all the items, names, places, things...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am an avid angry birds player and you might call my wife an AB widow sometimes... I have 3 stars and all the golden eggs for all levels of the original (except for the very latest level pack) and seasons, so I have been itching for some more AB!  The graphics on this are quite the step up and are much appreciated.  They also introduce a new bird to the arsenal and a \\"boss\\" that you have to fight which adds a little more to gameplay.  One change that could be a plus or minus is that they replaced golden eggs with golden fruit (pineapples and bananas so far).  Its a plus since there are more to find, but a minus in that there is no bonus level associated with each one.  The levels also seem a little easier.  I was able to get 3-stars \\"unassisted\\" on all levels in a matter of a few days.  I found all the golden fruit pretty quickly too.  On the original and seasons, there were some levels that took me days to clear one level, even after looking at a \\"cheat\\" off youtube.  Maybe they are looking for a bigger fan base?  At any rate, you can't argue with free and its satisfied my AB addiction for at least another week.  DL it now!
B00005KARK|5.0|I wont go on and on like a lot of people are doing. Its very simple to just say the truth and let everyone know that DUMBO will always be the greatest movie out on dvd or vhs. My great grandaughter, age 2, will be seeing it for the first time and i am so excited. I am 68 years old and remember Dumbo and most  scenes since I seen it and that was the  first time it came out. I absolutely love this movie. Thanks for listening and hope youll see it soon and feel as i do.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|Classical movie with one of the Audrey's best performance, great history with an amazing music and romance... needs to be seen by everyone!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Chuck is in its fourth season now and it's still highly entertaining, fresh, and funny. Personally, I even prefer it to the third season of the show. Hopefully, NBC will renew the show one more time!
B004RUF9DC|1.0|Based on what the other reviewers have stated, I will not purchase this Blu-ray issue of \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\".  I did notice that no where in the description did it state that this film has been restored; whereas the simultaneous release of \\"The Ten Commandments\\" in blu-ray is restored and it is stunning.  It does appear to me that the Blu-ray release of Greatest Story is attempting to ride in on the coattails of Ten Commandments.  As there is really no excuse for issuing poor quality on blu-ray, I will wait for a restored blu-ray issue of The Greatest Story Ever Told.  The reason we purchase blu-ray is in anticipation of very high quality.
0312600844|1.0|This has to be the worst book I have read in my entire life. Please do not waste your time or money on it! 600 pages of boring nothingness.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|love this game! however it gets laggy after playing it for awhile. other than that it is so much fun to play and my cat likes the sound effects lol
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This one really surprised me, I didn't think it would be so good!  I'm more of a fan of their Mother Earth -era stuff, I think they started to slow up their songs more and more as each new album was released...but not this one!  It's really rockin' throughout the whole thing.  One of my favs for 2011 already.<br /><br />Not a fan of the cover but its the music that counts, right? :p
1439102724|2.0|I have read most all of Jodi Picoult's novels.  Some I have liked more than others, but I have remained a fan for a good number of years.  After reading Sing You Home, I have decided I need a break.  This novel left me feeling annoyed, disgruntled, and more than a bit disappointed in an author I have followed for years.  I found this work to be filled with overwrought drama and cliche ridden characterizations that did little to draw me into a story that was presented in such a heavy handed manner that I felt I had sunk into a deep hole and was unable to climb out.<br /><br />At the heart of this story of gay rights is actually a really sweet love story.  The characters of Zoe and Vanessa were the sole bright spot in this tale, and I thought the author did a marvelous job of depicting their relationship.  It made the book all the more frustrating because I thought their story was truly worth telling and could have really soared if it hadn't been weighed down by the social issues and injustices that the author was trying to expose.  As a reader, I felt that the author just kept beating me down with gay rights issues at the expense of telling a good story.  While she included a lot of important points, she failed to add any new perspective or teach me anything new.  I could easily sympathize with Zoe and Vanessa and keenly felt the injustice of what they were going through, but it wasn't long before I was shouting \\"enough already, get on with it!\\"<br /><br />I spent the first half of the book wondering what further terrible things could happen to these people, figured out exactly where it was going about half way in and spent the second half biding my time just wanting to make sure I was right  (even though it seemed terribly obvious).  This book showed none of the author's usual deft touch with characters, and instead of building emotional suspense throughout, it felt contrived and the progression of events clunky and forced.<br /><br />I will note that I did not listen to the accompanying CD.  If I had enjoyed the book more, I have no doubt it would have added a welcome dimension to the story.  As it was, I was glad to see the end of this book and regret to say that I will no doubt be taking a break from Ms. Picoult's work in the future.  Not a recommend.ying CD.

1416562605|5.0|I read this novel a couple of years ago and I still look back, savor the experience and recall this as one of the best books I have in recent years.  It has everything I am looking for in reading fiction:  strong narrative voice, gritty and realistic descriptions and characterizations, wonderful insight into a culture and place which are unknown to me.  I thought the author used a magnificiently original first person presentation.  Highly recommended, no melodrama here, witty and insightful.
B004L49K20|4.0|Duran Duran were understandably, but incorrectly labeled as a boy band. For no boy band I know has taken such artistic risks, such stylistic shifts, and has lasted 30+ years. Plus, Duran Duran do not fit the corporately manufactured mold for a boy band which is The Backstreet Boys, New Kids On The Block, N*Sync, 98 Degrees, O-Town, etc.<br /><br />That being said, Duran Duran have certainly had more ups and downs than many a band their age. Five, three, two, five, four, who can keep track of how many shifts in the number of original band members? What is Andy's problem? What label are they on now? They know all about the fickle record execs (and fans for that matter). I don't know anyone who still listens to Duran Duran. Who are these so-called fans writing reviews here? Have you always kept up with Duran Duran, or are you just dropping in to see what they sound like now?<br /><br />I was there from the beginning, back in 1981, when MTV began, and they used to play videos 24 hours a day and nothing else. MTV was great--focused, not interested in selling sex, teenage pregnancy, spring break, game shows, reality tv, and other detritus that has polluted the minds of generations beneath mine. In fact, I believe I saw the videos for \\"Planet Earth\\" and \\"Girls On Film\\" long before \\"Rio\\" was released in the U.S. I always liked Duran Duran, but I never bought an album until \\"Decade\\" in 1989, and I was reminded why I liked them in the first place. From that point forward, I kept up with Duran Duran, excepting 1990's \\"Liberty\\" which I would get years after its release.<br /><br />So here is \\"All You Need Is Now\\", 30 years after \\"Duran Duran\\" debuted in 1981. Four original band members still in the band (not bad). Using Mark Ronson as producer, who challenged the band to make a sequel to \\"Rio\\". A tall order, but one the band was up to. Now, the band has left Sony records after only procuring 2 of 4 contractual albums for the label. Now, they have moved to an independent label, and are trying more marketing tactics such as releasing the album digitally in December 2010 and physically, with additional tracks, in March 2011.<br /><br />Let's look at the 9 original tracks released in December. For that's what the band originally intended. When you listen to those 9 tracks in sequence, \\"All You Need Is Now\\", \\"Blame The Machines\\", \\"Being Followed\\", \\"Leave A Light On\\", \\"Safe (In The Heat Of The Moment)\\", \\"Girl Panic!\\", \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\", \\"Runway Runaway\\" and \\"Before The Rain\\", you have, all things being considered, a very strong album. Drawing from disparate parts of their repertoire you get the \\"Medazzaland\\" experimental fuzz of \\"All You Need Is Now\\", the New Wave energy of \\"Blame The Machines\\" and \\"Being Followed\\", \\"The Wedding Album's\\" \\"Leave A Light On\\", \\"Duran Duran's\\" 1981 funk of \\"Safe\\" and \\"Girl Panic!\\", \\"Red Carpet Massacre's\\" \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\", \\"Runway Runaway\\" and \\"Rio's\\" \\"Before The Rain\\".<br /><br />Yes, after much listening, I am certain that Duran Duran have made an underrated gem, and are an underrated band altogether. Where is the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction? Where are the Grammy's for all their hit singles? What type of respect has MTV given Duran Duran for catapulting them to stardom? (That one is easy, MTV does not play any Duran Duran videos anymore, old or new).<br /><br />I see other reviewers giving \\"All You Need Is Now\\" the royal five star treatment, which I disagree with. Five stars means classic, and \\"All You Need Is Now\\" is not classic Duran Duran. It will not touch the masses and influence on a global scale the way \\"Rio\\" or \\"The Wedding Album\\" did. So, no, it's not five stars. Neither is it one or two stars. That's ridiculous. This is not the worst album Duran Duran has produced. Four stars means this is very good, but not classic. Certainly a strong effort for a band that's been around 30+ years, one of their better albums.<br /><br />The sad part about \\"All You Need Is Now\\" is thereare several potential top 40 hits here, but Duran Duran haven't had a top 40 hit in almost 20 years in the U.S. Newer bands are indebted to Duran Duran such as The Killers, Fall Out Boy, Panic At The Disco, The Bravery, White Lies, Bloc Party, Maroon 5, Keane, Lady Gaga, etc.<br /><br />But, you know what, I'll take Duran Duran as is, a reformed New Wave pop band that has now turned out to be very underground (which is trendier anyway).<br /><br />Here is how \\"All You Need Is Now\\" compares to Duran Duran's previous works:<br /><br />1981 Duran Duran: Five Stars<br />1982 Rio: Five Stars<br />1983 Seven And The Ragged Tiger: Five Stars<br />1985 (Arcadia) So Red The Rose: Five Stars<br />1986 Notorious: Three and a Half Stars<br />1988 Big Thing: Three and a Half Stars<br />1990 Liberty: Three and a Half Stars<br />1993 (Duran Duran) The Wedding Album: Five Stars<br />1995 Thank You: Three and a Half Stars<br />1997 Medazzaland: Three Stars<br />2000 Pop Trash: Three Stars<br />2004 Astronaut: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 Red Carpet Massacre: Four Stars<br />2011 All You Need Is Now: Four Starshaven't had a top 40 hit in almost 20 years in the U.S. Newer bands are indebted to Duran Duran such as The Killers, Fall Out Boy, Panic At The Disco, The Bravery, White Lies, Bloc Party, Maroon 5, Keane, Lady Gaga, etc.    But, you know what, I'll take Duran Duran as is, a reformed New Wave pop band that has now turned out to be very underground (which is trendier anyway).

142311339X|4.0|My son is a huge fan of novels with fantasy and magic. His first and favorite series are [[ASIN:B004GXB2E0 The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches (Signature Illustrated Edition, Keeper Martin's Tales Book 1)]], [[ASIN:B004GXB1UU In the Service of Dragons (In the Service of Dragons, Book 1)]], and of course [[ASIN:1423101502 The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 5)]]. I pre-read most of my kids books just to make sure there are no surprises. As an adult reader, I really enjoyed Rick Riordan's writing style. And though this may actually be my least favorite of his, my son enjoyed it a lot.    The Lost Hero begins with Jason, Piper, and Leo as they are sent to 'wilderness camp,' which is a place for bad kids. Soon after arriving they're attacked by Venti and their camp councillor (a satyr) is abducted. Magic transports them to Camp Half-Blood, and this is where their adventure begins.     The book brings back Greek Gods, monsters and quests. Jason, Piper and Leo learn a great evil is about to be unleashed, and its up to them to save the day. My son says if you liked Percy Jackson or The Kingdoms and the Elves, you'll like this too.
0316069485|3.0|I think that the author didn't really want to write this book. It was like he didn't believe in the story - in the idea that Mickey would actually join the prosecution. There was no sense of urgency or the greasy, slimy feel that the Lincoln Lawyer had that made it so good. They didn't even get into the courtroom until halfway through the book! It was just good enough to keep me entertained but they sure as hell won't be making this one into a movie. You can honestly skip this one if unless you are a major Connelly or Haller fan. I hope the Fifth Witness is better.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I would highly recommend purchasing the Social Network DVD.  It is an excellant movie.  I saw it twice in the theatre.  When it became available on DVD, I ordered it through Amazon.com.  I used to buy my DVD's at a local department store, but for the last two years I have been ordering them from Amazon.com.  It is easy, fast, trouble free and the prices are as good or better then the department stores.  Its the only way to go.
B001CDLATE|2.0|Probably the most overrated Blu-ray on Amazon. Watched this 1 time. I also have the Planet Earth Blu-ray which I think is much better and watch frequently on my high-end home theater system.     If you want to purchase this watch for used as I will be selling my copy here.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|(Note for purposes of discussion, this review does contain some very minor information about series 1-4 of Doctor Who. I wouldn't call them spoilers, but those who absolutely want to remain completely unspoiled as to 1-4 may wish to avoid this review.)    There is a very noticeable change in tone in the fifth series of the new Doctor Who. Some might attribute this to Matt Smith, but the blame or credit (depending upon your perspective), I suspect is more due to Steven Moffat taking over from Russell Davies as the man in charge.    Lest anyone get the wrong idea, this iteration of the Doctor is still fun, but at times, I missed the passion found in series 1-4. Matt Smith is delightfully quirky as the new Doctor, but he's working with what is being written for him (and he's upstaged by Karen Gillan as Amy Pond in a number of episodes...not necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it does feel more like \\"The Amy Pond Show\\"). Aside from the episodes \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" and the series finale (season finale, in American vernacular), it's rare to see this incarnation of the Doctor express sheer joy in the workings of the universe, humanity itself, or simple happenstance.  Personally, I found Eccleston and Tennant most engaging when at the extremes of emotion. There isn't much here that compares with Eccleston nearly breaking into tears of joy and exclaiming \\"Just this once, everybody lives!\\"  or Tennant's farewell in his final episode (to name just two of many). That isn't to say that series 5 is devoid of emotion, but it does seem to play less a part on average.    The writing too, has taken something of a hit. This was a bit of a surprise to me, as I greatly enjoyed Moffat's work (writing and/or producing) on Coupling, Sherlock, and past series of Doctor Who. It's not bad by any means, but at times it seems to lack the attention to detail we've come to expect from series 1-4. Most notably, the finale has a giant gaping plothole which is never addressed. Of course, that's not a first for Doctor Who, but at least Moffat himself (or at least he was credited with it) gave a wink and nod to the paradox he wrote himself into in \\"Blink\\" with the \\"big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff\\" line in series 3.    Nonetheless, good series and recommended to fans of series 1-4. I look forward eagerly to series 6.    --Also, I might add that the soundtrack here is one of the best of any of the Doctor who series.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr do a spendid job in teaming up in this drama-comedy. The narration done by Downey is refreshing. Kilmer and Downey make a great team, the scene where they are trying to hide the dead body behind the car I laughed so hard I seen stars and couldn't breath, I haven't laughed like that in watching a movie in a long time. The spider scene is great too! What happens when you put Kilmer and Downey together in a movie, you get a great fantastic hilarous, serious movie! Nice job! Watch this DVD you will not be disapointed.[[ASIN:B000F5GNX8 Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (Widescreen Edition)]]
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Don't be fooled by the photos. This watch is more suited for a petite woman or a child. It is \\"tiny\\". The band is very narrow, and the winding mechanism sounds cheap. I bought this for myself but now I am looking for a kid in the neighborhood to give it to.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|It starts out a bit slow but then picks up, I viewed it twice and the second time around enjoyed it more than the first time. RDJ did a great job of sherlock holmes. [[ASIN:B001OQCV6A Sherlock Holmes]]
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|This album is a must for the car disc changer if you appreciate a Coldplay/John Hartford/Dave Matthews fusion.  Besides the frequently aired \\"Little Lion Man,\\" other great tunes on the album are \\"The Cave\\" and \\"Roll Away Your Stone,\\" tracks two and four respectively.  The only drawback to the album is that it focuses on a single mood and I like an album to switch it up a bit.  \\"Little Lion Man\\" is the only single that really seems to go on a different vein.
3453400607|3.0|This whole story's coolness surpasses the book.     1. The author wrote the first comic book to ever win a literary award.  2. The movie adaptation employed groundbreaking 3D technology.  3. It took 10 years to write this 160 page large font novel.    Unlike Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe which is kids adventure/life lesson. This is kids adventure/parents horror flick.  It plays on parents' worst fear, that their kids could be lured away by an amiable stranger and kidnapped.  The heroine makes a very adult call regarding materialism - little life lesson to kids slipped in - that's almost too heavy for the whimsical story but does give it meaning. Other than that it doesn't moralize much and comes across as an edgy kid's book.      First impression I'm like, come on talking cat *cough cough* Alice in Wonderland.  Ooooh wall gives way to secret passage nice rip from C.S. Lewis.  But then it totally takes off on its own and even comes into the 21st century with some spacey logic to justify this other world.  Even more so there's a graphic novel of it that looked lovely but how much do you want to spend on this story? Dying to see the movie!
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|I found this to be light, often delightful, a pleasant romp. If you scratch the surface there is a little more about what spying takes out of you...as per the norm Dreyfuss and Freeman were superb.
0061120073|5.0|Only book I've given 5 stars to.  Absolutely incredible.  400 pages, each one a joy.  The kind of book you read while walking and don't even notice the dirty looks.    I think it's the perfect novel. It's like art. Some artists can get good at all the technicals and produce great successful interesting work and some do all that but with this added gift. She's so gifted as a writer. She could literally write about a tree in Brooklyn I would read it. It's reflective of the writers personality which I don't usually like but here it adds depth. Her descriptions and storytelling struck me down and blew me away. One of my faves of all time.
B00447G2PM|1.0|I have a 54inch VT25 3d tv..I only mention that to validate the point the movie is not what is suppose to be...the 3d on vt25 is outstanding so it had to be the movie...straight to the point....plain and simple.... I was expecting to see a 3d movie and what i saw as standard blueray. I was very disappointed in that there is not a lot of 3d content out that and to be duped doesn't help the demand for more and at this price!!  3D rocks just need more real 3d content
0374531269|5.0|I felt so fortunate that this story was written and I could read it.  Possibly the most gruesome and innocent book I've ever read.  It flips your heart around what it means to be a human being and what we (any of us in the right set  of circumstances) are capable of.  And it twists your brain around our role in foreign conflicts - who do we fire against when the rebel leaders are actually civilian children.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Its a lot of fun but lags and everytime I play theres a period where it wont let me slice anything. Luckily I got it when it was free
B004RUF9DC|4.0|MGM Home Video have done a great job with this BluRay release.  The orignal 2.75:1 Aspect Ratio has been preserved, and with the added resolution of HD, you can actually now read the opening credits (which are in a very small font size).      Regarding the print....please note that the negatives for most United Artists films are long gone.  They are merely working with what materials exist today for many of these films.  Even the negative for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN no longer exists.  Still, MGM/Fox have done a good job with what they have to work with.  I actually think they have done a great job.    The film itself is high-camp at its greatest.  Director Stevens treats his subject so seriously, but the \\"stunt casting\\" with innumberable cameo roles sinks the whole picture.  As in the words of John Wayne, playing a Roman Centurion:  \\"Surely this is the son of Gawd....\\"
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Wait, did I say this movie was boring?  Granted towards<br />the end it picks up a little, but too late too little.<br /><br />The script was rather sparse, and what little of it<br />there was, it was cryptic.  Most of the movie you are<br />trying to figure out the point of it all.  It was very<br />slow going for me.<br /><br />Let me also mention that whenever they spoke in Italian<br />the subtitles were too tiny to read on the screen.<br /><br />He had some kind of relationship with the priest, but<br />really nothing came out of that.  The relationship with<br />the prostitude was more meaningful with happy future, but<br />that did not pan out either.<br /><br />Most of the movie he was busy with machine shop tools<br />filing, drilling, with little to no dialog.<br /><br />George Clooney has many other movies much more interesting<br />than this movie.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|This sequel to \\"Batman Begins\\" abandons the tight, relentless pace of \\"Begins\\" in favor of what can only be described as a loud, tedious and fragmented narrative. The fundamental problem is that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is really two films clumsily fused together: the grand social commentary of the Joker plot and the intimate descent into psychosis of the Two-Face plot. Individually, each plot could have resulted in a worthy successor to \\"Begins.\\" I say \\"could\\" because the poor acting, cinematography and pacing of \\"The Dark Knight\\" would almost certainly undermine any attempt at two distinct films.     Let's start with the acting: Bale is a mediocre Bruce Wayne and a terrible Batman. He manages to convert Bruce Wayne from endearing playboy to neurotic \\"frat boy\\" while providing an almost incomprehensible Batman voice. You anxiously hope for the Joker to silence Batman so as to provide some relief from Bale's embarrassing delivery.  Heath Ledger is horribly miscast in his role and spends the entire film overacting, lecturing and annoying the audience with bizarre mannerisms. Gary Oldman has no fewer than three *different* contrived accents in the film. Aaron Eckhart's chin frequently out acts him and you long for the overwrought lunacy of Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face to Eckhart's brooding and ponderous portrayal. Finally, Maggie Gyllenhaal makes Katie Holmes' Rachael Dawes seem elegant and nuanced.     The cinematography of this film is brutally schizophrenic: either frantic, unfocused and disorienting or slow, long and repetitive. It's as if the director couldn't decide between shooting a frenetic Jason Bourne film or a serene National Geographic documentary. Action sequences are almost indecipherable and you stop caring about the outcome and just want the broken-steadycam-operated-by-a-drunk footage to cease. As one reviewer put it: \\"I defy you to diagram the opening fight sequence in the parking garage.\\"     Finally, there's the film's truly terrible pacing. There are so many needless tangents and diversions to the core plot: the yacht, the expedition to China and the hospital sequence just to name a few. Transitions are plodding and yet disconnected. You are subjected to one lecture or expository scene after another occasionally punctuated by a throw away action sequence.  The Two-Face plot, rather than heightening tension, only serves to bog the film down. The pacing is also hurt by an annoying tendency to highlight special effects shots which are mediocre at best and poorly integrated into the live action.     In summary, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a mess; full of sound and fury yet signifying nothing. Nolan and Co. went for epic and operatic and got derivative and shrill instead.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|In May of 2001, a 47-car freight train belonging to the CSX Corporation rolled out of rail yards near Toledo. Twenty-five of the train's cars were empty. Of the 22 cars that were not, two were tank cars containing liquid phenol, a hazardous chemical (though not in itself explosive). This particular train was noteworthy because, as a spokesperson for CSX explained to the media, the engineer was \\"nearby\\" when the train departed - \\"nearby\\" being PR-speak for \\"not on board.\\"  Over the following two hours, the unmanned train traversed 66 miles of Ohio countryside, at one point reaching a speed of 47 mph (though, as simple arithmetic suggests, averaging around 33 mph). Police manned crossings to ensure the train passed without incident. A second engine managed to link to the train and, by braking, slow it to 10 mph on an upgrade, where a railroad employee was able to board the train and stop it.     From acorns mighty oak trees grow. In Hollywood, incidents like the one described above inspire movies: movies that, like mighty oak trees, belie their humble origins.  But isn't that one of Hollywood's imperatives: to spin entertaining tales from events of real life, and in doing so, transport us to magical realms? Yes! Unfortunately, the trip this film took me on is one I have taken before: the scenery and the stops were all-too familiar, as were the people I met along the way. [Spoiler!] Crucially, I found zero suspense in the fate of the train: were it to derail and precipitate the potential disaster suggested, what would you do with Denzel Washington's and Chris Pine's characters? Indeed, where would you take the story? No, the story only works (if it works at all) if it ends with cheers and high-fives all around. Competent performances, high production values, but oh so predictable.
030758660X|5.0|I originally bought this book because my best friend made me read all the Twilight books. And I liked them. Not quite as crazy in love with them as she, but they were a great read on the train and I liked the knitted items I found in the movies when she dragged me to the theatre.     Now I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. So naturally I had the Harry Potter Knitting book on pre order for nearly three months before it was released! BTW, also a great must have for knitters! So when I stumbled across this book, I thought, Hmm...... well, if I get one or two patterns I like it would be worth it, and I could knit up something for my Twilight Crazy friend!     Well not only are the patterns great, but they are highly flexible. If you changed the color scheme just a bit, it wouldn't be vampire inspired, so great for gifts for your non-vampire inspired friends. And some of the patterns are just so awesome! I can't wait to finish the Shapeshifter Shrug, which due to it's button placement you can wear different ways. There's a pattern for fingerless mitts with a wolf paw pattern on the palm, and I already have three friends lined up demanding a pair! And if you liked Bella's gray mittens in the movie and tried to buy them (EIGHTY BUCKS and DISCONTINUED by the store that carried them) have no fear, the pattern is in here to knit up your own.     So even if you don't like vampires, twilight, or werewolves, I still encourage you to add this book to your knitting arsenal. The patterns are flexible, fun, and quite trendy!
B00006CXSS|5.0|There's not much I can add that hasn't already been written or recorded about this series. Superb acting, production, storytelling, and the intermittent commentaries from Dick Winters and other soldiers are priceless, in my opinion. I've gone on to read a lot more about Dick Winters because of this series. Thank God for him and others like him in World War II. A true American hero.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|SOLID album! This is pop bliss at it's best. Britney seems to get better with each album and definitely takes advantage of sick beats and fun lyrics on 'Femme Fatale'. Britney has become the go-to-girl for awesome, substantial dance/club music. If you're expecting lyrics with depth or slow ballads, you won't find it here. She keeps the party going with this album and proves she's still got it. I applaud her direction in music and can honestly say this record proves she is the Pop Princess. I also recommend the deluxe edition of this album. The four bonus songs on the Deluxe are worth it and should have replaced some of the initial 12 songs on the standard edition.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd is the only band in my iTunes Library that sports its very own, self-entitled Genre.<br /><br />It was sometime around the 4th of July weekend, circa 1980... when Pink Floyd changed my life forever. Being an average kid, I was just riding my bike through my neighborhood when I saw something on the sidewalk. I rode up to it and discovered that it was a cassette tape. The album cover was black and it had this cool looking triangle with a rainbow coming out of it... only it wasn't a rainbow-arch... it was more like a rainbow-laser... I had never seen a spectrum before, so I had no clue what I was looking at. I only knew that I was fascinated and I couldn't wait to hear what was on this tape.<br /><br />So I stuck the cassette tape into my pocket and went straight home. I ran right into my bedroom and put the cassette tape into my cassette deck that had... wait for it... AUTO-REVERSE! Yeah I know, right? All my friends were so jealous... it was a recent hand-me-down from my Uncle. But of course I didn't have any speakers for it, which I was constantly complaining about. So much so that a neighbor had just given me an old pair of headphones he wasn't using any more. They were HUGE... and they were that old classically hideous Tupperware green. But wow, they sure sounded great.<br /><br />So anyway, there I am laying on my bed, sporting those gigantic puke-green headphones, reaching over to push play... and that was the moment that my education began. I closed my eyes as \\"Speak To Me\\" did just that, and by the time \\"Eclipse\\" had finished, I had been transformed... no less dramatically than a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. I know it sounds cheesy, but I'm being sincerely truthful. I had closed my eyes as a child who had his world completely figured out and mastered, only to open my eyes and discover that what I had been seeing as my entire world, was barely a grain of sand.<br /><br />I was no longer ignorant to the amazing power REAL Music held. And ever since, there has been Pink Floyd, and then everyone else.Floyd, and then everyone else.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I really liked this books characters and setting, but the plot was a little disjointed in parts and seemed to linger over points too long.  In several parts I felt like the ending was close but it would start over all again which was the tiniest bit irritating.  But other than that I really liked Anna and her friends and felt the her relationships.  Worth getting definetely.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. Definitely looking forward to the sequel. I am very surprised by those that say this book was boring. There were parts that slowed down a bit, but I never lost interest in these characters.
B003VQQG8K|5.0|Well written and I could not stop reading. The images included were just enough to show what the author was talking about.   I would give this book 5 stars!
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|Don't believe the boors who think if you like a Viking Metal band you have no inkling of  Euro culture. Just the opposite of those jaded head-trippers. This is just a solid blast of  great head-banging fun from some Euros who know how to not only put on a great show but have  some humor and style as well. And let's face it, if you were facing death from a dragon boat  and were the only man left to defend your village, you'd have Amon Amarth going thru your head  too. Pure fun. Thanks Amon, can't wait to catch you on tour, and thanks for the super generous  CD/DVD product, it is beautifully packaged and well worth my hard fought gold dust.
0385737955|2.0|Okay, this could have been a really good book. Interesting plot line, especially with all the hype over \\"The Hunger Games.\\" There was so many creative aspects that weren't elaborated on.<br /><br />1. The characters: This was one of the problems that the book had. Some authors can have a large main cast and you won't get confused. Unfortunately, Dashner is not one of these authors. I had a hard time keeping the characters straight in my head. I only knew who Thomas because the story was told from his point of view. I knew who Teresa was because she was the only girl in the story. The other boys were given one character trait (grumpy, chubby, annoying) that set them apart from the other characters, barely. The only character I could even muster up any feeling for was Chuck, because he had personality, flaws, a backstory, and some character development.<br /><br />2. The setting: There was tons of possibility to develop the Glade more. The Gladers could have had more of a culture, as opposed to just giving them a confusing slang (I still don't know what any of those words mean, would anyone like to clarify?) I felt like I barely knew what the Glade was like, either. Okay, the walls move at night. They know its a maze. Not much more elaboration than that.<br /><br />3. The Grievers: Okay, these could have been actually somewhat terrifying creatures. Getting stung or getting chopped to pieces by their knives, yeah, that's scary. What happens to some people after they've been stung--well, wouldn't you expect that to come from a scary creature? But no. When I read their descriptions, I envisioned large bugs with knives instead of pincers. Not some awful, horrible creature.<br /><br />4. The pacing: I don't know how exactly to phrase this, but the pacing just seemed off. It didn't follow a typical book, with the beginning, the rising action and challenges until the climax, and the solution. It was like, climax, climax, climax, with no resolution. There is a difference: Some books will leave you hanging, but most of the questions have been answered and tied-off. This one, I felt like none of my questions had been answered and that the author was using last resorts to make sure his next book did well.<br /><br />This book could have been so much better. The plot line was interesting, the Glade was an interesting place, the villains could have actually been scary. But no. This book was one wasted plotline.but most of the questions have been answered and tied-off.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I needed something on my phone to keep my 3 year old attention when say we are waiting in line or at a doctors office. he loves this game and actually request to play it. I also like the fact you can replay levels so it makes it easier for me to pull up a easy level i know he can do that will not fustrate him. As for myself i find it a great distraction and stress releaver to play
0670022411|4.0|A Discovery of Witches came highly recommended as a Twilight for adults. I enjoyed the simplicity of the Twilight series, have always had an interest in witchcraft and I love historical fiction, so this book sounded like a good fit. I must say that this book, the first book in a planned trilogy, is an absolutely stunning debut novel.    This is an outstanding novel, a sweeping story of adventure, mystery, history, mystery, intrigue, love, and self-discovery. The story is richly detailed and the characters are very likeable.    I was completely drawn into the story of the life of scholar and researcher, Diana Bishop, who is wrapped up in her work. She has turned her back on her powers and ignores the fact that she's a witch. She forms a bond with fellow professor Matthew Clairmont, who is also a vampire and conducting research of his own. Diana finds a long, lost magical manuscript while conducting some research in the Bodleon Library at Oxford. Before long, Diana can no longer ignore her powers as she is drawn into a web of intrigue in which humans unknowingly co-exist with witches, vampires, and daemons.     I enjoyed every moment I spent reading this book, I especially loved the lead characters, Diana and Matthew. A Discovery of Witches successfully incorporates several literary genres: mystery, paranormal, romance, history and science fiction. This is a marvelous book that was very well written and presented. I look for to reading the next book in this trilogy.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Probably the last thing anyone needs is yet another review of \\"The Pacific\\", but I guess that I need to write it.  As you probably know, this 10-part HBO series, produced and narrated by Tom Hanks, follows a small handful of marines through WWII in the Pacific.  The series starts with action at Guadalcanal, continues through the Battle for Iwo Jima, and follows the surviving main characters home after the war.<br /><br />War in the Pacific was a gritty, dirty, and forsaken affair.  Though US Army soldiers were certainly in the majority in that theater of operations, \\"The Pacific\\" follows the war through the eyes, ears, and lives of US Marines.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed Hanks' earlier project, [[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of Brothers]], so I was anxious to take a look at \\"The Pacific.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Pacific\\" struck me more as an overall experience than as a series of interlocking stories.  Sure there are different characters, and we see their strengths and weaknesses, but what I walked away with was an overall impression of the terrible conditions that our military personel had to live and fight in.  The fighting was desperate and the typical Japanese soldier early in the war was already a hardened veteran.  Out troops, on the other hand, were committed, but green.  Battle soon changed all of that.<br /><br />You should be aware before you watch that there are MANY gritty battle scenes, including vivid depictions of the gore, terror, and death of battle.  This is not a series for the faint of heart.  This is not viewing for the entire family.  My 17-year old son and I watched a good portion of it together, and he handled it all right, but I will not let my 12-yr old daughter watch it!<br /><br />Once again, I have to say that my overall experience with this series is that it provided me with a glimpse of what it must have been like to serve in the Marines in the Pacific during WWII.  My hat goes off and my respect and admiration goes out to all of our veterans, and to all of the men and women who continue to serve in the military to preserve our liberty.  Thank you!<br /><br />5 stars, but not a show for the whole family.<br /><br />Note: This review is based on a content-edited version of this series.inue to serve in the military to preserve our liberty.

B002Q85A1I|4.0|Our ballet company did the 2nd act of this wonderful show where music and dancers snatch us to another reality.  It is so enjoyable to just listen to.  That being said, another rendition occurred on the Muppets where Rudolph Nuryev and Miss Piggy did \\"Swine Lake.\\"  The music is grand enough where it could take such a teasing and still send me.
1595141979|5.0|I have really been enthralled by this series. I couldn't put it down and I am frustrated I didn't plan ahead and get the next book ready...now I have to be patient until I can get it! I am so impressed by Rose and the growth she has gone through in this series.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|To get the best sound imaginable with the E7 and an iPad do the following: purchase the iPad Camera Adapter (which also is a USB connector) and connect it to the iPad. Connect the E7 to the Camera Adapter using the E7's supplied USB to USB mini cable. Connect your headphones (I use Bose Quiet Comfort) and start hearing music as you never have before. I use the BASS1 and USB CHG OFF settings on the E7 and turn Equalization Off in the iPad's iPod settings. I was ready to send the E7 back after not hearing any improvement over the iPad sound using the Fiio E5 and L3 Cable. Using the USB out connection from the iPad lets the E7 use all of its sound technology on the \\"raw\\" signal from the iPad. Enjoy!

159448385X|5.0|I received this book from a client's wife who belongs to a book reading group at her place of residence. It was on her coffee table and being the book reader that I am, I picked it up and started to read the back. The cover of the book had a eye catching picture and it immediately grabbed my attention. I started reading the book at that very moment and was up to Chapter 4 by the time she arrived home and my visit was over. I could not put this book down. I have never had a book \\"swallow\\" me up as this book did. What a tremendous story. The book opened my eyes in regards to the way of life for people in Afghanistan. I highly recommend this book to everyone who has a interest in reading a wonderful book that will grab your attention and will not let go until the last page is turned.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This is a good quality cable.  Came with a drivers disk.  Loaded drivers and was up and running in 5 minutes.  Would have been quicker but USB port that I plugged into was Com 5 and not Com 1 that I setup with my serial adapter.  Switch to Com 5 and it works like a champ.  Would buy again if I ever need another USB/Serial adapter.

0307279189|5.0|NEVER in my life have I RIPPED through a book at this pace.  This is a fine example of why I HATE fiction.  REAL LIFE is stranger than fiction any day of the week and until i read every NON FICTION book on earth i will not be reading fiction..........ever!!!!!!!!!  This is an unbelievable read and it took me 2 days to digest this book.  The pace and style of this is terrrrrific. The subject matter...fantastic.    If your a runner then you have to read this book.  If your not a runner you have to read this book.  If your a winner in life you have to read this book.  If your a loser in life you have to read this book.  If you have a heartbeat you have to read this book.  I RECEIVED THIS BOOK FROM MY NEIGHBOR FOR CHRISTMAS.  WE kind of do this every year...give each other a good book at Christmas.  This year F L gave me a better book then i have him.....FOR SURE..........THANKS F~!!!!!!!!  The only other FORM of cerebral entertainment that has affected me this much in my 54 years of life is the Long Way Round/Long Way Down Deluxe Box DVD Edition of Ewan McGregor and Charlie Borman Tripping around the world on their motorcycles and bringing it into my home to change my life.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Not a typical book I would pick out to read (I'm very much into fantasy books), this trillogy is by far one of my favorite that I've read. I started reading it because it has been recommended to me by a lot of people. This first book starts off kinda slow, you keep reading (about 150 pages)and you're not really sure where the story is going. But once you get through the beggining, you're hooked. One more negative thing I found with it is the translation. As a foreigner I had a hard time understaning it sometimes and would have to re-read sections. But it wasn't so bad it would stop me from reading. Like I said, one of my favorite books ever. And absolutely need to read the rest of the trillogy.

0439023521|1.0|If you want to read a book about kids killing other kids, then this book is for you.  If you would like read about an otherwise sympathetic main character breaking the bloated fingers of a girl she has killed to pry a bow and arrow from her hands, and then to rejoice at her good fortune in obtaining the lethal weapon, then this book is for you.  In this story, 24 innocent children are plucked from their district and pitted against each other in a life and death struggle.  These hitherto innocent and peace loving children have been chosen by a starvation induced lottery system to become killers, and they do.  All the kids become killers with little to no self-reflection, even the main characters who are supposed to be 'good'.  There are profound situation ethics problems that are proposed by this story that are unsatisfactorily answered.  If you read this book, read it with your eyes open to the unethical actions of all the adults and children involved created by this author.
0811879542|5.0|When we talk about interactive picture books we're usually talking about pop-up books or tactile books with fuzzy/bumpy details. When we talk about picture books that break down the fourth wall, we're usually talking about titles that approach the reader directly with a narrative like [[ASIN:037582913X The Monster at the End of this Book]] or [[ASIN:078681988X Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!]] or [[ASIN:1416985816 Can You Make a Scary Face?]] So where do we slot the little French import Press Here by Herve Tullet? Interactive but also reliant on the paper format, this here's an entirely new breed of book. One that has its finger firmly on the pulse of what kids are used to, while at the same time finding a way to both upset and exceed their expectations.<br /><br />You know what kids love? Being told what to do. Seriously, it's a thrill for them. Take Press Here. From the title onward children are given specific directions like \\"press the yellow dot again\\" and \\"try shaking the book\\". For every action the child takes, the book seems to respond with the turn of a page. Dots flit and fly in all directions. Sometimes child readers turn out the lights. Other times the dots grow huge on the page with every clap of the reader. By the time you've reached the end all the book has to say is, \\"want to do it all over again?\\" and you can bet that every reader in the room, tall or small, will scream out an appreciative \\"YES!!!\\" in response.<br /><br />I wonder . . . is this the first picture book of the picture book app age? Could you have published a book quite this specific ten or twenty years ago? Does Press Here (called just Un Livre in its native France) in fact mark the start of a whole new genre of children's fiction? Which is to say, fiction for children that are familiar with interaction and, indeed, demand it. I say that in full knowledge of the fact that only a certain privileged segment of the current youthful population has the opportunity to play with interactive electronic toys. Still, I've enough faith in both the small techies and their non-electronic kin to believe that if you tell them to rub a circle in this book, they'll still have the wherewithal to know to turn the page afterwards. I think.<br /><br />I've heard people say that while an eBook or an app of a book may be amusing, it doesn't have the smell of a book. Smell is important, I'll grant, but I've sniffed enough picture books with nasty rotting cheapo glue in their spines to know that not being able to get an olfactory whiff of a title is sometimes a blessing in disguise. No, the real advantage any given book has over its electronic counterpart is the tactile experience. With screens all you'll ever feel will be a slick, smooth surface. Books (ironically once deplored by the gatekeepers of children's literature if they ever included interactive parts) have the distinct advantage of getting to be furry, fuzzy, softy, plushy, or downright chewable from the start. Normally such tactile books are relegated to babies. Yet every book is, in its way, a physical experience. Take Press Here. First off you've got these thick cardboard covers, clearly built to withstand some serious blows and shakes. Then you've the pages inside, which are shiny and thick enough to give you the impression that you're really accomplishing something when you turn the page. And that, right there, is yet another advantage over the electronic form. While on a screen you can turn a \\"page\\" with a mere flick of your index finger, here kids get to revel the pleasure of lifting the thick luscious pages themselves. It's a magic trick that never stops giving. The page has now become the lifting of a curtain on the world's most basic stage.<br /><br />As a children's librarian I had to consider the readaloud potential of this book. Sure, it's beautiful for one-on-one experiences. It would even work well with kids who've enough experience reading that they know what it's saying at any given moment.But what about for storytimes with big groups of kids? Since the book is constantly telling \\"you\\" what \\"you\\" should do next, the reader would have to read the text and then do the instructions themselves. That could be fun, but if I know anything about toddlers and preschoolers, you know that you had better have some pretty long arms if you're going read this aloud to them. Otherwise you might find them approaching you like small determined zombies, arms outstretched so that they might press and touch and rub and tap the book for themselves. At least you can get a big group to blow and clap their hands for the later portions of the story. That's pretty good.<br /><br />I imagine a picture book app for this book with something approaching mild horror. This is odd, particularly when you consider the debt this book owes to the mindset that accompanies that technology. Yet to make this into an app would render this book . . . ordinary. No different from any of the other downloadable games out there and, indeed, much less impressive. What sets Press Here apart from the pack is the fact that it is printed on paper. There's a magic to the book that is akin to the magic of pop-up books. In paper there is power and Press Here taps into that. It is, I hope, the start of great new things to come with one of the oldest formats on earth.<br /><br />For ages 3 and up.But what about for storytimes with big groups of kids?

B004LGPBZI|4.0|Like most die-hard Oasis fans, I hoped for the best but expected the worst with this album. While it was never going to be up there with some of the old band's efforts, Different Gear, Still Speeding has a good amount of energy and charisma and has some pretty good tunes. Highlights include The Roller, Bring the Light and Four-Letter Word, but my favorite track form the album is Kill for a Dream. Well worth buying.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Either you embrace this sort of film or abhor it.  I fall into the former category. \\"Gosford Park\\" is a slow-paced but wryly perceptive examination of British classes in the early 1930s. Think of it as \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" as viewed through a microscope. The huge cast is difficult to identify upon first encounter, just because of the sheer number of worthy characters who share screen time. So effective is the acting that each of the personae seems to have a back history. This may cause momentary confusion, as you wonder why he or she is behaving in such an inexplicable manner. But it also fleshes them out and makes them appear to be real human beings, rather than conduits of stereotypical posturing. The story line is convoluted in the extreme, perfect for such a \\"murder mystery.\\" I put that in quotes because homicide is only an excuse for screenwriter Julian Fellowes, director Robert Altman, and a brilliant contingent of actors to provide some of the most captivating dialogue and characterization that you are likely to see in any film anywhere. (Personally, I fell in love with Kelly Macdonald.) By all means, invest your money in \\"Gosford Park.\\" You will not be disappointed, unless of course mindless action is your thing. And the bonus material alone is worth the price.
030726999X|5.0|Sad to see this trilogy end. Yet all over analyzing aside, it was a solid and entertaining trilogy.<br /><br />On a side note (for anyone interested in a great new author), I found  \\"American Charm\\" by Andrea Bizderi. It is one of the best books I have read in a long time! Seriously. It is one of those great books that only come along every once and awhile. It grabs your attention, draws you in, and leaves you feeling a slightly better person for having read it. I would highly recommend this to those looking for a stimulating story with a universal theme presented in a fantastically fun and intriguing new light. Looks like possible trilogy potential too!
B00004BZ0N|4.0|When this came out other than \\"London Calling\\" and \\"Clampdown\\" I wondered if the Clash had lost the plot. I was never into \\"Police And Thieves\\" punk reggae and they went crazy here on this album with \\"Revolution Rock\\" and \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" and \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" (although the latter is more ska-ish). Throw in the mixes of sounds from what sounds like lounge hitting the pub sounds of the '80s...well, \\"we\\" (as in the collective punk us) absolutely thought the Clash had sold out.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! Years later it is my fave Clash LP because it's varied unlike the first two which are straight punk (still great LPs but come on!).
B002T9H2MO|2.0|After reading all the hype and hearing all the buzz, I was completely let down by this movie. I guess the movie hipsters and scenesters loved this flick because David Bowie's son directed it and Sam Rockwell sports a beard and long hair at the beginning of the flick.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell does give a pretty good performance, although not great and Oscar worthy like some of these reviewers cry out about. Did you notice that at times when Sam stressed a certain word(s) at the end of his sentence he sounds a little bit like Owen Wilson?<br /><br />The plot was decent but really not all that intriguing to warrant the movie a 4 or 5 star rating. And yes, I get what the story was about and understood the plot twists and what not. But there were a few plot holes and unexplained situations and/or seeings that hurt the movie and actually made me annoyed. For a slow moving and not all that visually stunning movie, you really have to have a great and intriguing storyline with little to no plot holes and also great acting. Moon was somewhat there but not quite.<br /><br />And yes, if you haven't already noticed - \\"I just don't get it\\" and my favorite movies are probably: insert here a brain-dead/popcorn-flick/run-of-the-mill/cheese-ball movie here. Obviously the previous sentence has my tongue (errr... fingers) firmly planted in cheek. Just stating this for the sci-fi geeks and pseudo intellectuals / movie critics that whine and complain when a reviewer gives his/her unfavorable opinion about their movie.<br /><br />I give Moon 2.5 moons, errrrr...stars.
B00004BZ0V|4.0|This is a five-star CD for the music but CBS blew it by not including some B sides of those same singles. Was there no room for \\"1977\\" (flipside to \\"White Riot\\")? I don't get it. Throw us longtime fans a bone, eh, as I'm tired of trying to convert my vinyl to MP3s!

B002BWP4A6|5.0|Holy moly, the creepiest movie since The Ring. Shot in black in white only adds to the barren and isolated feel to the northern German village where all sorts of horrible \\"accidents\\" happen. The movie is set on the cusp of World War I for reasons you'll have to ask the filmmakers. I didn't think the foreboding of violence to come really was all that relevant as this horror show could really have occurred in any time period.<br /><br />The Oliver Platt lookalike lead actor is the narrator for the story in case you can't figure that out. It'll help you understand why the tone is taken from this \\"now living outside the village\\" insider.<br /><br />The violence is on a scale unimaginable but it is not shown being done. The aftermath and consequences are only shown allowing us to try to be in just as much confusion and fear as the villagers themselves.<br /><br />Brilliant filmmaking as the answer is never 100% revealed so we're left to draw our own conclusions.

B00005JPSM|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought this was going to be some light rom com. Be prepared for serious tearing up in this one as, although it has its comic moments, it's a movie that knocks you for a loop. I won't spoil anything for anyone but it has both tears of joy and sadness.<br /><br />I thought the casting was terrific from Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin (who could have come across as cute yet cloying but really was terrific in this as a kid whose world changes in an instant).<br /><br />The DVD extra (there's only one) is a look at how the main actors prepared for their roles as chefs. It's an episode of \\"Unwrapped\\" from the Food Network and is really a fantastic insight into the way actors work.
B0034G4OY0|2.0|After watching the trailer, I saw this movie with high hopes, but was let down after the first scene. It became immediately apparent that they spend half their budget to recreate an unrealistic-looking tsunami just so they could grab people's attentions with the trailer, and that's not necessarily my biggest complaint. Rather, Hereafter sets a premise, but does not follow through with much character development, and has no ending. It is merely half of a movie -- one that could have been something like a Lifetime channel original, but does not even make it that far.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Why this movie was not a huge hit at the box office shows you the masses always have questionable tastes. As a war movie on its own it's a thriller with some frenetic street fighting scenes and super tense action. As a political thriller is where is really takes off as it's an expose of the whole WMD scam that led to the US invasion of Iraq under Bush the Dubya one.<br /><br />Matt Damon carries this movie with an evenly played intensity that never goes over the top. If you're wondering why the military scenes are so well done, you'll learn on the extras that the soldiers playing soldiers in the movie are soldiers. They were also culled from these same army units that were sent out to find these non-existent WMDs.<br /><br />The director is Paul Greengrass who did the last two Bourne movies with Damon so you get that same level of action but this time it's far better played. Whereas the first Bourne movie (The Bourne Identity) done by Doug Liman stands head and shoulders above the Greengrass follow-ups, Green Zone shows Greengrass knows how to scale it down to a more human level without the action impeding too much on the story.<br /><br />Kudos to the casting, especially Khalid Abdalla who becomes the translator for Damon's military unit virtually by accident.<br /><br />The DVD is definitely worth the price as you get to see the story behind hiring actual soldiers to fill the military roles and the way the filmmakers turned Morocco into the war-torn streets of Baghdad.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I have a rather unconventional interpretation of Black Swan, and it is a similar interpretation that makes Darren Aronofsky's [[ASIN:B000O7667K The Fountain [Blu-ray]]] one of my favorite movies of all time. Darren Aronofsky is the only director that I know of to date that has succeeded in depicting the internal dialogue and development of the subconscious, visually, on screen; events that straddles between imagination and reality. The audience is shown a vantage point that does not wholly exist but is rather how the mind reacts to reality. Most of the events that happen on screen are not what the protagonist sees, but how to protagonist feels. While The Fountain focuses on Hugh Jackman's mental struggle to overcome the death of his wife (i.e. he does not really travel through time), Natalie Portman's character Nina does not really go crazy, or schizophrenic, in Black Swan; rather, the audience is taken through the psychological transformation of the white swan into the black swan that takes place within Nina's subconscious. The movie is, therefore, about a brilliant ballerina and method actress and the triggers that developed her from being pure and sheltered into the jealous, maniacal, but emotionally powerful character she was by the end of the film. And in the end she exclaims that this is her best performance ever. Sort of like an actor that transforms into the role he plays, we see Nina finally arrive at the state of mind that allows her to play the black swan, unrestrained, and with flawless execution. We can say that the whole movie was Nina's mental journey during the final act, similar to how the only events that we can be sure happened in The Fountain was Rachel Weisz dying and Hugh Jackman burying the seed in front of her grave, before walking off.
044654146X|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book.  It tells a good story, but it is not a scholarly work.  Without denigrating the achievements that it highlights, the book seriously underestimates the economic and social problems within Israel, both in the present and in the past 25 years.  Although the introduction warns of Jewish chauvinism, the book winds up sounding very similar.       I have heard and read Shimon Peres's views on science and technology, and their portrait of him is accurate, I believe.  I hope that their descriptions of other major personalities are as reliable, but the tone of the book contributes to a certain amount of skepticism.         The authors' contrast with the surrounding Arab countries are correct, but I don't accept the notion that they are culture-bound.  Egypt and Iran, for example, each have an ancient, robust, intellectual history.  Iran, in particular, still has a high-quality system of education, including higher education, and still produces well-schooled scientists in many fields.  The authors get right the impact of political repression on creativity and initiative, and there are many in the Muslim world who seek to turn back the clock. In some ways, however, that is also true of the Hasidim and other religious right in Israel.  The book only mentions the facts that their exemption from military service and their lack of representation in high-tech is an economic drain.  Why then is it permitted and perpetuated?  It does not mention that they tend to have much larger families than the secular Jews, and their children are subsidized in varying degrees by the Israeli government. Nevertheless, as in India, this tends to keep them impoverished.       Israel is a much more complex story than the one portrayed in this book.
B004I11VZ0|4.0|Ip Man 2 capitalizes on the success of the Ip Man, unfortunately losing some of the raw emotion that comes through the original. One can sense that the scene direction and flow of the movie was placed predictably, as if following a formula, in the way that Michael Bay botched [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]], but not as bad. The difference is Ip Man 2 is actually entertaining, the fight scenes are still beautifully choreographed; but while the original Ip Man made you identify with the protagonist, made you feel sorrow through his revenge that led to the final scene, Ip Man 2 seems trot along only because the audience already knows that Ip Man is a hero, and it tries too hard to outdo itself to drive home that point.    This movie reminded me a lot of [[ASIN:B001HUWQEK Jet Li's Fearless [Blu-ray]]], only it feels inauthentic.    Why did I still give it 4 stars? The original Ip Man was a martial arts masterpiece and Ip Man 2 had large shoes to fill. By itself, it was an entertaining romp, although with a predictable, and somewhat cheesy plot that follows tightly to martial arts film cliches, but it does this mediocrity extremely well. This would be an excellent Friday night rental, and you might even rewatch this if you weren't looking to be emotionally engaged, but just want to watch Donnie Yen kick ass.

B004NSULHM|3.0|Honestly, I thought that Radiohead would be over after \\"Hail to the Thief\\" but when they came out with \\"In Rainbows\\" I was pleasantly surprised. That album has become one of my favorites of theirs, which is surprising for a band that has been around as long as they have. When Radiohead dropped the announcement about the King of Limbs coming out I was extremely excited to see what the band would have to offer next in the form of their 8th LP. Unfortunately it was pretty much a let down. Usually their music is really engaging, with a lot of different textures and ideas (musically) emphasized that string all the songs on the album into a whole. The only thing that I feel like is cohesive about this album is it's lack of energy. It is underwhelming, repetitive, and electronically over killed. I love Radiohead, but this is not a great album. I would call it mediocre. Not awful just not up to par with the rest of the work they have put out.
0312600844|1.0|To be fair, I can't truthfully give a review because I didn't finish this book. I couldn't. There are too many books and not enough time to force myself to read a novel that bores me as this one does.    I don't like the characters but I have read novels where I have not liked the characters but still was curious about what would happen next. The problem here is that I don't like them enough to hope they turn their lives around or hate them enough to hope they continue to wallow in their nothingness.    There have been only 2 other novels in decades of reading that I have decided enough is enough and put the book down unfinished. If I have missed something by quitting at the halfway point, too bad for me but I am on to enjoying the next book on my nightstand.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|Beethoven.  Hard to go wrong no matter what the format.  I have a number of collections of Beethoven's symphonies and find this one with the power to send chills up and down my spine. Even without understanding the words, the fourth movement of ninth can make my eyes mist.  The exhilaration of the fifth symphony as we transition from the darkness of the first movement to the uplifting light of the fourth is well represented in this collection.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|Today I saw Sucker Punch in the theater, and I must say, I am NOT disappointed. Admittedly, there were some clear weaknesses, but Sucker Punch held it's high. The cinematography was excellent, but everyone already knows that.     Zack Snyder really knows how to create an atmosphere, and I found myself cringing at the disturbing actions happening but not seen on screen. I guess it just goes to show you that one's imagination can be the greatest psychological horror tool, and too me, this movie was the most disturbing movie I've seen, even more so that A Clockwork Orange.    The twists and occurrences where excellent and extremely well done. It was brilliantly disturbing, and I could only stared wide eyed with wonder at the screen.    My major criticism would be that some of the action sequences go on for too long. Although they were entertaining, too much of a good things just makes it bland. See this movie!

0060763280|5.0|I first read the audio book version and decided to get a paper copy.  The book is not about wealth management of investment strategies, although it contains some of that.  The book is mainly about mindset: how to remove the mental blocks that prevents people from being rich.  Although one can still argue whether being rich is the ultimate goal of life.  But if you have determined that accumulate wealth is goal worth working to, this book provides valuable advices.    The tone of the book is quite provoking.  It may get people uncomfortable.  It was done in purpose, to shock people out of the common wisdom.  On the other hand, it is too absolute and one-sided.  I think one would be well advised to take it with a grain of salt and keep in mind that is is but one of the views about wealth and means to get it.

B004M6BQ9W|5.0|Although it's a little obvious at times that Christina Aguilera hasn't done much acting, the movie's musical numbers are absolutely amazing! Cher is fabulous as usual and her on-stage performance in scene 2 is worth watching over and over again. I did not know that Julianne Hough (Dancing With The Stars) was in the movie until I watched it. She does a fabulous job as well. I'm surprised this movie did not get more awards than it did, especially when it comes to the musical performances. Yes, the storyline is a little cliche and predictable, but Christina's vocals and performances more than make up for the writing. Stanley Tucci does an excellent job and I love the storyline between him and Cher. I've watched this movie at least 30 times since I bought it and it just keeps getting better. I find myself looking up some of the songs on YouTube when I'm at work because I can't get the songs out of my head! Definitely not a guy's movie so don't even try, but they do enjoy all the scantilly clad women. The soundtrack is excellent and there are no boring parts in the movie, although I do usually skip scene 1.

0618918248|2.0|Dawkins set out to write an atheist book were the reader would read being a theist and walk away being an atheist.  This book sort of reminds me of an hell fire preacher who uses the idea of hell as a means of making converts, Dawkins paints a picture of Atheists as the enlightened ones (the brights) and theists as being naive, believing in a myth and even worse by being religious they perform untold atrocities.  Same as the effective preacher, from the persuasive rhetoric there might be converts but ultimately it doesn't really address the question, is there a God.  I don't think you have to look hard to find religious people who are in fact intelligent and see all of the good that also comes from it.   (On a side note, I think its pretty apparent from human history that removing religion or God won't stop prejudices, wars, ect., sadly this seems to be part of humanity, does Dawkins not realize he's just as intolerant as the people he's complaining about being intolerant?)     At one point in this book, likely anticipating the backlash his book would cause, Dawkins discusses how he's not an atheist fundamentalist.  According to him, to be a fundamentalist you are so stuck in your beliefs that you won't change them regardless of the evidence, this sounds nice but like most of the book its just rhetoric and simply doesn't appear to be true.  He uses examples of scientists who change their views in light of new discoveries, but someone calling him a fundamental has nothing do with his views on science but his atheistic fundamentalism, which is very apparent.  Often in other negative reviews of this book you'll see complaints of how Dawkins knows nothing about Christian theology or doesn't have any understanding of the bible.  Another thing telling is almost all of his sources are atheist writers, now if you're going to claim to not be a fundamentalist and open to change if evidence is present wouldn't you at least read some theist apologists?  I'm not saying his viewpoints would be different, but it would be absurd for me as a protestant to go and only read anti-catholic literature to get a perspective on Catholicism, surely Dawkins can understand this?  Sadly that's not the case, when his lack of understanding of theology is mentioned Dawkins just replies something about not having to study about leprechauns to prove they don't exist.  This might be fine and true but if the vast majority of humanity did in fact believe in leprechauns (and had done so throughout all of known human history) then I do think you might at least try to understand why they believe.      To keep this review from getting too long, I'll just discuss a few parts of the book.  The first is the section on NOMA.   As a Christian who loves science this part of the book frustrated me, Dawkins is so concerned with his anti religious proselytizing that he doesn't really seem care about getting people to accept things like evolution (he wants them to accept evolution but only at the cost of belief in God).  I'm fully on the side of Gould where we should separate science and religion differences.  There are many Christians who accept evolution and are doing good work in getting others to accept it also, but Dawkins wants to keep pushing Darwinism as his God and make Christians think its either or, which its not.     The next is his section on the old and new testament, sadly I question if he's actually read any of the bible for himself.  The stories he mentions in the old testament seem to be only the same ones used by Julia Sweeny (someone he often mentions), and like most of the rest of the book he doesn't mention the other side of the bible showing once again a lack of knowing anything but the atheist arguments.  I'll admit firsthand that some of the stories he mentioned seem horrific now days, but some of these stories weren't meant to be used things to do but moral guides.  Take for example the horrible story of Jephthah, who promises to God to sacrifice whatever/whomever meets him first if God gives him victory, the person turns out to be his own daughter and he then sacrifices her.  This story is terrible, but its not meant to be taken as what to do, but instead of what not to do (in this case make rash promises to God), elsewhere in scripture human sacrifices are strictly prohibited (and would have been prohibited here).  I'm not going to go into most of the other examples but I think any reader of the bible would be advised also to read about hyperbole and its use in the bible.      Dawkins also makes an absurd assertion that \\"Love Thy Neighbor\\" was strictly for the Jews as neighbors, but Dawkins clearly forgets later when Jesus is asked but who is my neighbor the extremely popular story of The Good Samaritan.  The Jews at the time hated the Samaritans, and the purpose of the parable was to show just how much thy neighbor was all of humanity not just the Jewish ones.  He also must have never read Deuteronomy where the Israelites are constantly told to treat foreigners well because they themselves were once foreigners in Egypt.     Dawkins ended the book discussing just how limited our knowledge and perspective is.  How we only see and understand a small part of whats actually going on in the world.  I think the world and science are amazing things, we should pursue knowledge and understanding.  I think we (theists) shouldn't force science to fit into out religious viewpoints (such as a 6000 year old earth), but at the same time there are questions which science can't answer, we're limited by our own evolved mind and religion may or may not answer those questions, but I think its sad that a book like this is far more concerned with proselytizing (biased at that) than actually considering the question of God.

0307272702|4.0|I bought it for myself, as I have insulin resistance.  I probably would have been better off with an abridged audio book version, as I really just wanted the cliff notes.  If you really want an in depth history, science lesson, this is a book you'll want.<br /><br />I do like the handout on a basis to start low carbing, much like Atkins.<br /><br />What hit home was chapter 19, and how sugar addiction affects the brain much as cocaine and herion do.  I also liked he was real about stating everyone has different levels of carbohydrate tolerance.  I am probably one that would do best without artificial sweetners (as I am one of those who uses them and thus it keeps my sugar cravings alive, and I give in).  I like he says try, and try again. Good book, just not sure I want to live life without sugar, even after he gives compelling evidence to the benefits of life without it.

B004IH0TS4|1.0|Rick Riordan, this is one terrible book!  I don't know why your series has so much acclaim, so much publicity, and so much recommendation.   Actually, this is one of the worst books I've ever read.  It starts, very simply, with Percy Jackson, this teenager-boy, on a bus to go on a field trip.   When he gets there, after a lecture on Greek myths by his centaur teacher [Well, readers don't know he's a centaur yet during that time period in the book], he is attacked by another one of the teachers, who turns into a monster.  What kind of a book is this? Anyway, on with the story.  Bla, bla, bla, he has a terrible neighbor his mother lets run in the house, they go on a vacation [Well, just Percy and his mom], and a monster is chasing them.  His mother screams to run away, and she is killed by the monster, which turns out to be a minotaur, and then Percy stabs it to death with it's horn. [He must be very strong to take that horn off that head, and with lots of guts to plunge it into the minotaur's flesh!].  Death! Stabbing! I can't believe this book can be so revered and loved by children.   People say it teaches Greek Mythology. Well, it teaches that Ares is a motorcycle punk with a skull head and flaming eyes, Zeus is a grumpy old Grandpa with all the power, Athena is a scheming snake, and that Poseidon is touchy and gentle, sigh, sigh, sigh.   This is opposite to all Greek Mythology, a distortion, taken, really.   Rick Riordan is just taking ideas from historical mythology, after all, he hasn't made anything else on a different subject, has he?  Well, in short, don't buy this unless you like gore and sloppy language and a bad book.  Don't waste time, or money, for this stuff.

A fun read, the author challenges you to think about your life, your decisions and your goals in completely new and sometimes radical ways. Unlike so many books that give nebulous prescriptions for success, Guillebeau cuts through all that \\"quick-fix\\" nonsense in a thoughtful and meaningful way. The book is littered with useful ideas, pithy and inspiring sayings and anecdotes from his own life.  It certainly helped affirm some ideas I had been grappling with for a long time.  A great gift idea for those who talk about doing things and never do them.
B003UESJHO|5.0|It doesn't matter that this kind of formula has been done a zillion times already!  People love to see a person who comes from the fringes of society, the bottom of the   socio-economic scale, or who overcomes some seemingly insurmountable circumstance, to become victorious.  We all cheer, our hearts leap, our cynicism is momentarily vanquished, and our faith in humanity  is restored!---We leave the theatre feeling great for a week or two.     This film, in itself, was an underdog. Mark Wahlberg and the powers that be behind this film  had a very tough uphill climb trying to get this film made.   Thank goodness that they were dilligent, because they created a brilliant film.  They found a new approach to an age old format, and the end result is quite impressive.  Both Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale turn in tour-de-force performances!  It amazes me how Christian Bale will loose weight, gain weight, shave his head,   his butt (just kidding!), get muscled and buff, or whatever it takes to completely inhabit his role.  Not since the prime era of Robert DeNiro, have I seen such dedication in an actor!  He wholly deserved his oscar this year for his portrayal of the rough, tough, and grizzled  ex-fighter brother of Wahlberg's character, whose best days are far behind him and he has fallen  into a crack-hazed purgatory. He finds redemption and a new purpose for his life in his close  relationship and involvement in the fledgling boxing career of his younger brother, played with equal  intensity by Mark Wahlberg, who buffs back up ala his \\"Marky Mark\\" days, but effects a whole other   level of maturity and accomplishment as an actor, which is indicative of his incredible growth  within the entertainment industry into a modern day mogul. He's a respected actor, producer of may hit films and   television series, and was a major force in getting this film made.  The supporting cast was good as well and their are moments of levity scattered through this story  which keeps itlight and doesn't get bogged down.  All-n-All, a great movie to own or rent.
0316010669|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell seems to have made a career out of writing one-idea books and turning them into bestsellers! I liked this one better than the Tipping Point (some ideas have \\"stickiness but we don't really know why) and Outliers (It takes ten thousand hours to become expert at something- perspiration instead of inspiration)  Having said all that, Gladwell writes very well.  It's smooth ride from start to finish and there are some moments that will yield genuine surprise. These books read like some sort of dissertation, a hypothesis with supporting arguments. But you always feel that the question was decided at the outset and Gladwell doesn't present or deal with much information to contradict his hypothesis. In that sense, perhaps it is (as one reviewed remarked) one part \\"junk science\\"

031606792X|1.0|How could Stephenie Meyer think that this was a good ending?  Like some reviewers have already said, it's like somebody else wrote Breaking Dawn because it's just so off.    === Some Spoilers ===    All that talk about choice and consequences in Eclipse was wasted.  Bella makes her choice and Jacob walks out of her life to go deal with it.  She's decided to leave her family and friends behind.  Give up having children.  That was good, that made sense.  Then poof!  All ignored in Breaking Dawn.  What the heck?  Why throw away her sacrifice?    Living rock is suddenly making vampire sperm, or storing sperm or whatever?  The story left vampire babies behind a looong time ago.  I read what Meyer wrote on her website about how she never said male vampires couldn't have babies.  That's such crap!  It doesn't matter what she says, cause she sterilized every vampire she had when she went with living rock.    I read some of the 5-star reviews and can't believe how many people loooove Jacob + Renlskwkjlwe (whatever her name is).  Are you kidding me?  This book is supposed to be for teens, and you're going to put something in that says it's OK for your uncle or your brother to one day get hot for you?  Oh, but not until you're seven, then that's OK.  ZOMG, isn't somebody else besides Meyer supposed to read this stuff before it gets published?  That is seriously twisted.    And who are those people in the book?  Were they in the first three?  It felt like somebody brought in, not the understudies, but the elementary school drama class to play them.  Talk about off.    When the heck would Bella love being admired by strangers when she hates attention?  When would Edward pimp his wife out to his arch-rival?  When would Charlie cave in without a fight, not once, but twice.  First when they tell him they're getting married and then when they show him the baby and he's all \\"don't wanna know\\".      Renee should have blown a gasket.  After all that buildup of how much she hates earlymarriage and she's all 'never mind'.  What?  Why waste all that time building it up if you're just going to flush it away?    And Meyer needs to get a new science book.  Bella drinking blood from a sippy cup (besides she can't stand the smell) doesn't send blood straight to the baby.  It gets digested.  They give her an IV, it still doesn't go to the baby.  AND they were feeding the demon child regular FOOD later.  It didn't need freaking O-neg, they just needed to FEED BELLA.    But the biggest insult Meyer did to this series was she killed the romance.  That's what I read the first three for, and it was gone.  Sexin' it up all the time isn't the same thing.  They had none of that in the first three books and remember how much steam was coming off the pages?  Meyer could have done so much better.  Guess she was off doing the Host.    I say run.  Run away screaming from this book.  The first three were pretty good but this one is just...gahhk.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have been using the 405cx for over 6 months now. I was a bit apprehensive about it initially when I read the reviews especially about the touch bezel. But honestly after setting my preferred data fields and locking up the bezel I have had no issues what so ever with the bezel. Ok I must admit I do still have to test the 405cx in the rains.<br />I wish though the battery life was longer than 8 hours, I have been caught with a almost dead battery even though I charged it to 100% the night before. The software is easy to install and upload. And finally it looks every bit like a sports watch unlike a police tracking device as to the other big dial models.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|This is the first pop album I've written a review for. With the exception of Britney, Robyn and Pink, I don't listen to modern pop music. Most of it sounds the same.  Britney is one of the few artists, of any genre, who's new music I buy automatically upon release.<br /><br />I wouldn't rate FEMME FATALE as Britney's best, but it's still a very good album. Considering it follows, what in my opinion were two near perfect albums, BLACKOUT and CIRCUS, it had a high standard to uphold.<br /><br />A \\"femme fatale\\" is defined as a mysterious and seductive woman whose charms ensnare her lovers in bonds of irresistible desire, often leading them into compromising, dangerous, and deadly situations.<br /><br />The album begins with two of my favorites. Up first is the very pretty dance track \\"Till The World Ends\\", which reminds me of something on Robyn's BODY TALK series. Track two is the albums first single, \\"Hold It Against Me\\". Normally I'm not a big fan of electronic dance music but......this is Britney!!<br /><br />Britney slows it down and heats things up, on the sexy \\"Inside Out\\". This track is closer to her sound on my favorite of her albums,  BLACKOUT. This is Britney at her best.<br /><br /> \\"I Wanna Go\\" is an upbeat dance track. I like this one a lot. The whistle sound adds a nice effect to this catchy song.<br /><br />\\"How I Roll\\" was one of my least favorites on this album on first listen. The male voice seemed annoying at first, but after a few listens, it's actually a very catchy track, and if released as a single, would probably be a radio hit.<br /><br /> I didn't care much for \\"(Drop dead) Beautiful\\" at first, but after a couple of listens it grew on me. This is an infectious dance track with some fun vocals from Britney.<br /><br />Britney gets naughty and seductive on \\"Seal It With A Kiss\\", inviting a secret rendezvous \\"in the shadows, where it's hot, got the risk of getting caught.\\"  The \\"oohoo oohoo\\" backup vocals in the refrain remind me of Beach Boys style vocals, although according to the notes, the vocals are female.<br /><br />\\"Big Fat Bass\\" is my least favorite Britney song since \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\", which, for me, kept IN THE ZONE from being a perfect album, but at least this one doesn't have anything as annoying as The Ying Yang Twins. Like \\"Boom Boom\\", it's not a bad song, but the male rapper, too many electronic effects and the monotonous refrain are pretty annoying, and ruin it for me.<br /><br />\\"Trouble For Me\\" is an upbeat dance track with some nice vocals from Britney, but the song is marred by a very annoying electronic sound which make it almost unlistenable for me.<br /><br />\\"Trip To Your Heart\\" is another catch dance track. The melody is nice and  Britney's vocals are some of the prettiest on the album.<br /><br />\\"Gasoline\\" is another really good track, and one of my favorites. I love Britney's vocals on this one, and they remind me of \\"Mannequin\\", one of my favorite CIRCUS tracks.<br /><br />Next is \\"Criminal\\", another great Britney song.  She doesn't seem to use much, if any auto tune, and puts in some really good vocals that pull at my heart. Britney sounds much like she did a few years ago, and reminds me of why I'm such a big Britney fan. The sound of a flute is also very nice.<br /><br /> \\"Up and Down\\", is the first of four bonus tracks. The song is very catchy and her voice sounds really good.<br /><br /> When I first heard the next track, \\"He About To Lose Me\\", I was struck by how her vocals sound like the young Britney Spears. Britney's voice with no auto tune is very nice to hear. Contrary to what some say, Britney has a very good voice. This mid-tempo dance track, is again, Britney at her best.<br /><br />\\"Selfish\\" is another good one. Britney's southern accent comes out on this sexxy song about taking control of the situation at hand. When she sings, \\"Pick you up in my Mercedes...I'mma be a little selfish....Just lay right there and don't you move. I'm in control tonight\\", whocould resist?<br /><br />The album ends, as good as it began. \\"Don't Keep Me Waitng\\" is one of my favorite tracks. It has real guitar, bass and live drums.  Britney rocks out on this one and does what I wish she would do more of....use real musicians playing real instruments, and sing her heart out.<br /><br /> The cd comes in a double fold cardboard sleeve. I would have preferred a jewel case, but it's a nice looking album. Credit info for each track is listed in the booklet. There are some nice photos of Britney, who looks as beautiful as ever.<br /><br />I rate this album, behind BLACKOUT, CIRCUS and IN THE ZONE, in that order, with .....BABY ONE MORE TIME, coming in fifth. FEMME FATALE may not be my favorite, but Britney has set the bar so high, it beats any pop music out there today. Besides, how many perfect, or near perfect albums can one do in a row?<br /><br />Britney shows a lot of playfulness and sexuality on this album, as she has on her past three albums, but after all, she is an adult. She will be thirty in December of this year. She also shows the versatility of her voice, and I know she has the ability to sing live. I wish she would stop lip-synching and show what she's really capable of.could resist?<br /><br />The album ends, as good as it began. \\"Don't Keep Me Waitng\\" is one of my favorite tracks.

B003Y74AXO|4.0|There is only one protective sheet in this package, so you don't get a second chance if you don't clean the screen 100% free of dust or apply it right the first time.  I have had other screen protectors that came 2 to a package so you could conduct a trial run if necessary.<br /><br />That said, if you do clean the screen well enough to be 100% dust and dirt free, it is no harder to work the air bubbles out of this protector than others I have used by just using a credit card and being careful while installing.<br /><br />This protector is not matte, however.  It is shiny and it does collect finger prints at least as badly as the naked glass.  If you don't mind reflective screens, this is fine.  Personally I prefer matte screens as there is much less glare.  Overall not a bad value, but not my cup of tea.  Perhaps Amazon will come out with a matte version for folks like me soon.

B003R0MF1W|5.0|Simon Baker returns for a superb third season as Patrick Jane, former psychic and current consultant to the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI).  Jane applies his keen powers of observation and psychological manipulation as part of the investigative team led by senior agent Theresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney), whose patience with Jane's often mischevious antics barely masks an growing personal interest.<br /><br />\\"The Mentalist\\" continues to present interesting cases for the team to solve, while highlighting their interpersonal dynamics and CBI politics.  Agent Lisbon will suffer through two new bosses, each with his or her own agenda and multi-episode narrative.  Lisbon will even be sidelined for one case, pushing the deadpan Cho (Tim Kang) into a not entirely welcome leadership role.  Grace Van Pelt (Amanda Rhigetti) takes up with a handsome and smooth talking FBI agent, much to the anguish of former boyfriend agent Rigsby (Owain Yeoman), but Van Pelt's new love may not be the man of her dreams.<br /><br />Patrick Jane barely survives an encounter with infamous serial killer Red John at the beginning of the season, and the pursuit of Red John will be a recurring theme.  As the team begins to suspect an insider leak, Red John will strike back hard at the people around Jane.  Jane will also have to contend with competition in the consulting business, including an astrologer, a criminal profiler, and a medical examiner.<br /><br />\\"The Mentalist: The Complete Third Season\\" should be highly entertaining to fans of the series, and is highly recommended to that audience for its unique take on the police procedural.

B0036EH3XE|2.0|The show had some superb episodes over its run--as good as tv gets. I LOVED the series...at least until the end. Would I recommend to someone who'd never watched the series, to start watching it? Thats a tough one, given I now know how it all ends up.    After letting the ending sink in for months, I have to sadly conclude that it was a disaster, and unfortunately undermines the entire body of work. This wasnt just a show about people--a characterization oriented show. No, this was also a mystery set in a unique location that was supposed to be highly relevant-\\"The Island.\\" For years they milked this and we assumed it was headed somewhere and debated the numerous clues, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.    In the end they couldnt pull it all together. Alas. They score a home run on the \\"characterization\\" part of the show, but strike out with the bases loaded on the \\"mystery\\" part of the show. Unfortunately, the answer to almost every mystery that we debated for years was \\"didn't really matter.\\" Think about that. Think about every puzzle you agonized over. Walt? The numbers? The candidates? Jacob? Babies? MIB? Smokie? Polar bears? The statue? Exploding the bomb? Did it work? The Constant? Desmond? Time travel? Widemore? Whether Widemore's people should or should not reach the island? Ageless Alperin? Charlie's sacrifice?    In the end, none of that mattered. It was all just a bunch of handwaving.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|Windup girl is an intelligent and well written novel. If you want a novel with a internally consistent narrative and interesting premise, then this is your book. It's the kind of book we used to see from promising new authors before the publishing houses abandoned their editing responsibilities. Windup girl is staged in a future world where our modern society has contracted due to the loss of petroleum as a fuel source. It is very dark in places, but stays internally consistent with the world the author has created.     Windup girl is the kind of fiction readers should support. I hope to see more books from this promising author in the future.

B004LWZW24|3.0|The first Saw film will always be something I fondly look back on. While the film had its fair share of bad acting and ridiculousness, that final twist just made everything worthwhile. Seeing it in theaters was something special, too. The snickering and the whispering amongst friends during the sillier parts of the film were silenced as Jigsaw revealed himself and the audience collectively picked their jaw up off the floor as a wave of silence washed over everyone. The downside is that director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell haven't really been able to capture that same sense of astonishment since. Death Sentence was a nice change of pace while Dead Silence left something to be desired, but both seemed to lack that key ingredient that kicked the feet out from under audiences like Saw did. Insidious looked to have potential even though most horror films about paranormal entities seem to fall flat on their face. While Insidious probably couldn't be considered the best film to be released this year, it's certainly still one worth seeing in theaters.<br /><br />Insidious thrives on music cues and cheap scares. Fairly intricate orchestral pieces that are very string heavy are used periodically throughout the film while at other times noticing the lack of music usually leads one to expect something to jump out at them at any given moment. Nearly all of the scares are like that though with creepy ghosts and creatures jumping out at you when you least expect it. The opening felt like it took up half the film. We see an old woman holding a candle followed by the title screen with a string arrangement turned up to 25 even though the initial volume only goes to 10 and then we waltz through what feels like the longest opening credit intro in history. We're shown black and white stills while the cast and crew are listed up on screen. The film seems to keep this pace the first half of the film. It's incredibly slow moving; a creak in the floorboards here, a door moans as it opens by itself over there, and then the payoff is something silly like a ghost dancing to silly music. In addition to the first half being slow, it felt incredibly anticlimactic and was unintentionally funny most of the time. I found myself being more interested thinking about what the key Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) wore around her neck could possibly open rather than being absorbed in the events taking place on screen. Thankfully, the film picked up a bit in the second half.<br /><br />One of the main drawing points of Insidious is that it's by the same people that made both Saw and Paranormal Activity. That's an interesting note as the first half of the film is very similar to Paranormal Activity if it was shot with conventional movie cameras instead of a home video camera. The second half seems heavily influenced by both Ghost Hunters and Poltergeist. The film's creativity lies within its introduction of \\"The Further\\" concept. Once we're shown that world and the evil entities seeking a vessel to come into ours, it feels like the film can finally begin; but it's bittersweet. It doesn't take long for the film to delve into familiar territory before closing on a predictable finale. The most devastating of the evil entities introduced in the film can best be described as the love child between Darth Maul and a faun. It was also kind of ironic hearing Patrick Wilson give that superhero speech since Wilson will probably be known best for his role as Nite Owl in Watchmen. Insidious does have a few intriguing surprises up its sleeve though. The main ones being when Specs (Leigh Whannell) is trying to get Dalton (Ty Simpkins) to follow his voice while Elise (Lin Shaye) wears that crazy looking gas mask and the other one being when we're thrown into the realm of The Further. The way that's filmed along with the bizarre events that unfold there will probably make that scene the one you remember the most after you leave the theater.<br /><br />Despite the film's many flaws,it's still recommended that you see Insidious in theaters. Why, you may ask? Seeing a film like this in a packed theater is something special. That atmosphere is incredible. While the film may not make you jump, it's entertaining to watch and hear how it affects everyone else around you. The comments people make under their breath and hearing some of the guys scream like little girls is something that just won't be the same if you choose to wait to watch it in the comfort of your own living room. It's the type of film you take a date to even though you know they hate horror films because they're going to be grabbing all over you throughout the film. Also, I don't think I've laughed at anything this hard all year. So maybe Insidious is entertaining for all the wrong reasons, but at least it's still entertaining.<br /><br />Insidious is an entertaining theatrical experience, but will probably lose most of its steam once it hits DVD and Blu-ray. The way it not only relies on jump out scares, but practically uses them as a crutch during moments of building tension will probably get old really fast to most viewers familiar with the horror genre. Throw in the extremely loud music and the film probably seems a bit more clich&eacute; than it actually is. Not to mention it feels like it takes forever for the film to find its footing. While Insidious does offer a few moments of genuine originality, it doesn't take long for those moments to take that detour into predictability. James Wan and Leigh Whannell do have some talent buried down in there somewhere, but it feels like they've yet to find their stride as bona fide filmmakers.

B003A4IFGY|4.0|You have to consider that TPH has a catalog that spans 35+ years.  That 35+ years covers a lot of influences and styles that shows the depth and range of this band.  As advertised, this album focuses heavily on a blues sound but its also contains elements of classic rock that seems to pay tribute to some of the most influential bands of the 70s.  If you are expecting the sound of \\"Free Fallin\\", go pop the \\"Full Moon Fever\\" CD in your CD player.  But if you want to hear exceptional musicians perform live jams without an over-produced and over-polished sound this album has a lot to offer.<br /><br />There really is not a bad track on this album.  Although I will admit that some of the tracks had to grow on me a little.  For example, the opening track \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\" is heavily soaked in blues but I found the harmonica riff a bit over the top and distracting at first.  \\"U.S. 41\\" was another track that had to grow on me.  There were others as well but after several listens to the entire album I grew to like them and I think the tracks on this album flow together very well.<br /><br />\\"First Flash of Freedom\\" is a long jam track that seems to pay homage to the Alman Brothers Band with its dual lead guitar solo work.  \\"The Trip to Pirates Cove\\" is a fun if \\"trippy\\" tune that tells a story of some partying buddies.  \\"Candy\\" is an upbeat 1-4-5 boogie woogie blues ditty that is just plain fun.  \\"I should have known it\\" is the real rocker on this album that seems to be a nod towards Led Zeppelin with its infectious hard driven guitar riff. \\"Let Yourself Go\\" has a similar vibe to Golden Earing's \\"Radar Love\\".  \\"Don't pull me over\\" is a cool reggae tune that to my ears seems to pay tribute to Eric Clapton's guitar solo style.  Influences aside, there is a lot of originality here too.  Good examples would be the tracks \\"Something Good Coming\\" and \\"Good Enough\\".<br /><br />In summary, MOJO is great sounding album by TPH that is a departure from previous releases.  It has something for everybody whether you are into blues, rock, reggae, and even country (No Reason to Cry).  It may not conform to the radio-friendly pop song format but it provides a platform to showcase the range and musical abilities of one of the greatest rock and roll bands in history.y whether you are into blues, rock, reggae, and even country (No Reason to Cry).

You will love it!

B003EYVXXW|1.0|texascelt    This film is a slander of St. Cyril of Alexandria, a Father of the Church and acknowledged as such by Catholics, Orthodox, and Coptic Christians. In his time, the Jews were much more powerful and wealthy than the generally poor Christians and had more of an in with the civil authorities. They organized persecutions and pogroms against the Christians of Alexandria. Cyril the Bishop spoke against such behavior, but he never advocated pogroms against the Jews. He did preach against what the Jews were doing to the Christians. But this was defensive rather than offensive. Slowly the Christian faith became the faith of most of the inhabitants of Alexandria. The Jews continued to invoke the power of the state against the Christians. Finally, they were ordered to leave Alexandria by the prefect, who had himself become a convert to Christianity. I frequently attend Mass at St. Cyril of Alexandria Church in Houston and plan to continue to do so. Sorry to bring up the truth, which may offend some Jews including Ms. Weisz. Evidently the producers of this movie feel that Christians are generally ignorant of Church history and their saints may be castigated ad libidum. In Texas we have a saying, If you spit in my face, dont tell me its raining.

Unfortunately, I hadn't read the blurbs closely enough and was not aware that this was one of a planned series, so the abrupt ending really surprised me (and I definitely will read the others).  What I got tired of were the extreme and sometimes incomprehensible emotions of the characters, particularly Matthew, the vampire, who seemed to be instantly furious about Diana's comments or actions, then got over it, then got furious again, etc.  If he'd been human, I'd want to tell him that life is too short to live on the extremes, but I guess there's no point in that comment for a vampire.  All in all, a good if sometimes exasperating read.
1582701709|5.0|Rhonda Byrne didn't write that.  Henry Ford did.  If you skip everything but the quotes, you'll still get your money's worth.  I'm a skeptic, like many of the reviewers here, but I'm not angry with the book for suggesting a few thoughts that just might help me get more of what I want out of life.  I don't think my thoughts vibrate at any frequency, or attract things and events that also vibrate at that frequency.  I'm a physics guy, so the words don't work for me.  The ideas behind the words, however, do.      I think it's important to think in a way that is appropriate for what you want to be or become.  An example: Food can make people fat.  When animals like us eat the wrong things or too much of the right things without burning the energy, we store it.  If a person sits down in a restaurant and orders an appetizer, an entrée that could feed two, and a desert, they are thinking and eating like a fat person.  If that same person thinks \\"I am fit and eat like a fit person\\" they will tend to make choices congruent with that thought.  Thoughts are real, and have a real impact on our choices.  Our choices have a real impact on our lives.    Maybe it's more powerful than that.  Maybe not.  I don't know, but at least that much is true.  This little book is well worth the two hours of your time it will take to get through it.  Take the parts that work for you.  Leave the rest behind.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|This Sapphire edition comes with two discs.  The first one is the movie and the second one are the special features.<br /><br />There's nothing much to say about the film that already have been said, so I'll just put that Forrest Gump is one of my Top 5 all time favorite movies.<br /><br />The special Features disc is completely amazing.  I'm head over heels about how movies are made and the actual story of how it all came to be.<br />I was pretty surprised how different the novel and the movie are.  The special effects, acting, anecdotes, etc.<br /><br />For me this is a winning format.  I'm happy because I got it and the price I paid is more than good.<br /><br />Get this.

1936041111|4.0|We're all familiar with the movie images of a clunky, bolt-headed creature who is both repulsive and oddly likeable. Commentators and critics throw out all sorts of theories about Mary Shelley's original message, many of them centering on the creation riling against its Creator.<br /><br />At last I've read the book for myself (my first novel read on an e-reader). The story starts with a ship in the cold Arctic regions coming across a man, almost dead, upon an ice floe. This  man is Victor Frankenstein, who gives account of his life for us, telling of his youthful interest in science, of his search for the key to life, and his discovery thereof. In his pride, he unleashes a monster that wreaks havoc more upon its creator than anyone else. The story ranges from Italy and Switzerland to Germany, England, and beyond. A number of murders occur, and Frankenstein in his unwillingness to seek help or bring the truth into the light, suffers the consequences, in much the same way we see in \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than I expected, more literary and thought-provoking. It touches on the evil within each of us, and the way that is unleashed through our pride, our secrecy, and our anger. In many ways it's a metaphor for man and science, for man and arrogance, for man and sin. This story continues to reverberate because it touches on so many themes, defying easy interpretation all the while. On the other hand, \\"Frankenstein\\" is much less than I expected. The horror and violence are mostly committed out of view of the reader. The story, like \\"Dracula,\\" is told through journals and letters and remembrance so that it feels personal while also feeling detached from the original actions.<br /><br />A precursor to many of our science fiction novels of today, \\"Frankenstein\\" was the foundation for H.G. Wells and Robert Louis Stevenson to further build upon these themes, and later, writers such as Heinlein and Crichton. It's all the more remarkable for being written by an English woman in the early 1800s, a stark contrast to books such as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It loses some of its horror and excitement in today's market, but remains a classic for its language and themes.for being written by an English woman in the early 1800s, a stark contrast to books such as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It loses some of its horror and excitement in today's market, but remains a classic for its language and themes.

0399250573|5.0|I began reading the Alex Rider series two years ago, and I was shocked when I found out that Anthony Horowitz was going to release one final book, instead of a couple more novels leading up to Alex's fifteenth birthday and tales from the past about Yassen. I was also pretty excited, and immediately pre-ordered Scorpia Rising. When it arrived in the mail, I started to read. It usually takes me less than a day to finish a book I really enjoy, but this final Alex Rider novel took a couple days to finish, since there was so much to take in.    Wow. Scorpia Rising was... completely mind-blowing. Part One, labeled \\"Scorpia\\", was shocking. No appearances by Alex, only mentions of him by the people trying to bring him down. There plans were ingenious, and it was hard to watch Alex cluelessly become a pawn in the second part. Part Two, \\"Alex\\", was so deep and emotional at certain intervals that I felt like Alex was a brother or friend. I knew everything about him, and I wanted to help him make it through. And Part Two was full of action, with guns and screaming enemies as always. Anthony Horowitz delivered plenty of violence--and Horowitz, as usual, managed to shove the puzzle pieces of the plot together and make everything fall into place like magic.    Certain parts of Scorpia Rising were... strange, different from the other books in the series. There didn't seem to be enough scenes showing off Alex's brilliant skills as a teenage spy--but then again, a little bit of vulnerability is a great character development tool. I felt like crying for Alex at times. I wanted to reach out through the pages and hug him.    The beginning of Scorpia Rising made me excited and jumpy; there was so much suspense! But by the end, I felt raw and oddly sentimental, and Alex's story was tiring me out. His tale ended in such a bittersweet way that it almost felt incomplete. Half of me was loving it, but the other half was still craving and expecting more.    Scorpia Rising isn't my favorite book of the series (that spot is reserved for Scorpia, Ark Angel, and Crocodile Tears), but it was a great final installment. It could've been better, of course, but the flaws somehow feel right.    Goodbye, Alex. I'll miss you.
B001LNOOG6|4.0|Jeffrey Archer's characters are so very British - ranging from upper class to the working man and women. The main character, East-Enders (blue-collar) Danny Cartwright, his Catholic pregnant girlfriend Beth Wilson and Bernie, Beth's brother and Danny's best friend, gather at a  pub to celebrate the upcoming wedding of the happy couple. Enter uppercrust Londers - four drunken men start a fight that ends up the murder of Bernie and arrest of Danny for his murder. Ultimately after much lies by the four men (who are well connected) Danny is found guilty sentenced to twenty-two years in Belmarsh high-security prison where no one has ever escaped.  Danny will become the exception with the help of his cellmate, Nick Moncrieff, a well-educated gentleman.<br />Archer has written a good story (although a bit wordy and long at times) with a few surprises here and there.  The bad guys are wickedly mean (bah to them, they get what they deserve) and the good guys we root for!
B004LWZW2E|5.0|nsidious... wow, what can I say.<br /><br />It starts with the title... what does it mean? It rings through your head. Insidious... insidious... it's a fascinating word. It means<br />\\"Proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with harmful effects\\". One should wonder, \\"why is it called Insidious?\\"<br /><br />I was excited about this film from the moment James Wan announced it. I am a fan of him and Leigh Whannell, and have been since Saw. Dead Silence was scary as hell and Death Sentence was pure fun. When I saw the trailer, I was so excited, and anticipated opening day.<br /><br />This film will grab you right from the opening shots and its opening titles. James Wan knows how to set the mood for an experience that will fill you with fear and dread, and Insidious is proof. The cinematography is excellent and atmospheric... boasting a mostly muted and gray look, Wan's visual style sure is eye-catching and creepy.<br /><br />The film's plot revolves around a family of five- A married couple, Josh and Renai, a teacher and musician and their children. Having just moved into a new home, they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging. However, one night, the eldest child, Dalton, bumps his head after falling off the ladder and is soon in a comatose state.<br /><br />Three months later, creepy stuff begins to happen. Ghosts can be seen. Break-ins occur. They move to Josh's mother's place, but even that doesn't help. Soon, they find out it's Dalton that's haunted- not the house, as he is stuck in a realm called The Further!!!<br /><br />Insidious is creepy and good fun. If you're expecting jump scares every 5 minutes, you will be disappointed. This movie is largely tension based, and jump scares are minimal. Wan brings back what horror is about- being SCARED. To feel fear... to dread what's coming next.<br /><br />The performances are great too- Wilson is excellent, and so is Rose Byrne. Also turning in a good performance is Leigh Whannell-<br />undoubtedly the show stealer- as the geeky and hilarious Specs. He and his buddy Tucker provide the comic relief (the flashlight scene was hilarious!!!).<br /><br />In short, Insidious is a success. Wan and Whannell clearly love being scared as much as we do, and it shows. To James Wan: Touche. Thanks so much for showing what horror is about!!!vide the comic relief (the flashlight scene was hilarious!!!).    In short, Insidious is a success.

B004L49K20|5.0|Perhaps the deepest Duran album. Ever.<br />It not only channels early Duran work, it refines it, and magnifies years of experience by pulling out every weapon in their collective arsenal.<br />This is a time capsule of how far this band has come as artists.<br />Congrats guys!

B000FBHC7S|5.0|For quite a handful of years as being a heavy metal listener, I have been searching quite a while for a record that finally is able to sonically achieve the HUGE, thick and irresistible sludge doom that Sabbath laid in their groundbreaking Master of Reality forty something years ago.  After unsuccessful stints with everything from Acid Bath, to Melvins, to Kyuss, to Crowbar, to Mastodon, To High on Fire, to Sunn 0))), and Sleep, Electric Wizard is finally the band that plays the ultra heavy sludge I've been looking for.  Sure, the bands I mentioned are all great for different reasons (eve though they didn't come to the sound I was looking for), but it doesn't get better if you are looking for incredibly heavy, menacing, rumbling, and thick @$$ slabs of monster sludge/doom/ metal, which no band has been able to pull off.  Dopethrone is the real deal.<br /><br />Dopethrone is widely regarded as being a seminal album in the genre, and listening to it, it's easy to see why.  Electric Wizard hit their stride here for being the ideal blend of stoner, doom, and sludge metal.  The bands guitar riffs here are the star here.  Finely written, melodic, fuzzy, and juicy, Electric Wizard crafts the ideal sludge/doom guitar riffs, being melodic but at the same time, well being sludgy and doomy.  It's the ideal sound that you've always thought of by name alone, and that's really the best I can try to convince you of the awesome craft and sound this band has.  At the same time, they don't go the end of the likes of Sunn O))) or certain Melvin songs, and instead actually trying to write songs like Sabbath did with their classic Master of Reality.<br /><br />Oh, and it's HEAVY.  Extremely heavy.  As a matter of fact, I think this is one of the heaviest albums I've ever heard.  Those guitars they play are heavy enough to cut down buildings.  No, The Wizard isn't what I would call intense.  Despite their incredibly heavy guitar riffs, they are slightly, dare I say it, a bit laid back, or, well, stoned (which is where the stoner parts comes in, in my opinion).  So you won't find any breakneck intense tempos and rip-roaring dynamics like you would in a Demolition Hammer or Dillinger Escape Plan record.  But the sound of this album is relentlessly, massive, thick, and heavy, and it feels, when listening to it, that a hole could easily crack in the ground.  Rest assured, even my seventy dollar headphones struggles to handle all of the heaviness the album has to unleash.  Next to this, Meshuggah's Nothing and the song Clouded off of Gorguts (both pieces of work being VERY heavy as it is) sounds a bit lightweight in comparison.<br /><br />Unlike other bands such as Sunn 0))) that use minimal strong structures and, well just drone on and on, Dopethrone's song structures are very much of Master of Reality by Sabbath (probably other ones as well, but I'm using this one for comparison).  The tempos and structures are slow and doom-laden, but they still are written with song craft, that the excellent bands like the ones above listed do not use.  Many of the song structures are indeed very similar to the aforementioned Master of Reality, being very slow but having quite the interesting songwriting.  There's a lot of thought in these songs and they don't just bash out ultra heavy riffs over and over again, and it's one reason why this album is such a memorable classic.<br /><br />Picking tracks is a bit futile, for this album is very addicting all the way through.  Heck, even the little instrumental jam, The Hills Have Eyes, is melodic and sounds great, and I wish it was even longer.  If I had to pick some highlights though, I would have to pick the dynamic and smartly written Funeralpolis, the great opener Vinum Sabbathi, the roaring and catchy Barbarian, and the title track, which is the pinnacle of Electric Wizard's desire to make the ultimate sludge/doom/stoner metal song.  Good.  Really good.<br /><br />Anyway, there's not much else to say here, but thisis an essential record if you've ever wanted to finally Check out Dopethrone if you are looking for ultra heavy, stoner-sludge-doom metal.  As far as I'm concerned, if you had to pick one metal album that falls into the category of this, it would be this one.  With no weak spots, and no sub-par Black Sabbath tribute songwriting that plagues many lesser albums of the type, Dopethrone is essential, essential, essential.  Highly recommended.wanted to finally Check out Dopethrone if you are looking for ultra heavy, stoner-sludge-doom metal.

B000068QZK|3.0|Zakk Wylde's predecessors, Randy and Jake, needed no gimmick because they were simply talented players. Zakk shows up with his leather bellbottoms and pinches a godawfully distracting *squeal* *squeal* *squeal* into every frickin' riff! Sure, it's cool every so often in a SOLO, but constantly throughout a song? Not sure that he added anything truly to essential to Ozzy's growing pantheon of guitarists.  At any rate, it's all appropriate in this context because the album itself is a \\"pinch\\" of a different kind--as in \\"loaf\\". The songs do not live up to the standards set by the previous albums. Even Bob Daisley's lyrics (excepting perhaps the introspective \\"Fire in the Sky\\") are simplistic and not up to his normal quality. \\"Tattooed Dancer\\"? \\"Crazy Babies\\"? \\"Demon Alcohol\\" is just silly and a subpar sequel to Suicide Solution which did not need to be written. Everything else is just middle of the road, honestly: Cool for what it is, but nothing downright amazing.  Zakk can riff it up with the best of them, and tears out a few meaningful ones in Miracle Man, Hero, Fire in the Sky, Breaking all the rules, and Bloodbath, but overall there's nothing that buries itself into your mind like the songs on Ozzy's first three albums.   The one thing that I really like about \\"No Rest\\" is the thick wall of Daisley bass in the mix. That's METAL.
0439023513|4.0|It was a great book; however, I was disappointed in the ending.   The author wrote a very detailed story and then kind of hurried to end it.   All the loose ends were wrapped but I got a sense that the end was rushed.

B004HWR406|3.0|I thought that this movie was ok but I didn't love it thus the 3 stars.  Lead character is a jerk with basically one friend who he eventually loses because of the way he was  jerk to him.  The twin Harvard brothers were equally jerks only in a totally differnet way.  I truly hope that the people that these characters are based on are not truly the way they are portrayed. Not sure that the movie deseves all the hype but I usually don't like movies that are hyped up and get all the awards.  The actors did a great job though of portraying these characters.  They were all pretty much unlikeable.   Sorry to see what money did to a friendship.  A billion dollars is alot of money but true friendship is priceless.
0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett does it again, in a sterling historical fiction novel - the first of an intended trilogy - that covers the 20th Century from the coronation of George V of Great Britain to the advent of national socialism in Germany in the 1920s.  The fictional characters mingle grandly with actual historical characters from the USA, Britain, Germany and Russia giving the reader wonderful insight into the classes of society that differed vastly in respect of all aspects of life before WW1.  Then in 1914, in Sarajevo, a Serbian nationalist assassinated an Archduke never ever believing that the shots he fired on that fatal day would take the power nations of the era into the horror of WW1.  Notwithstanding risqu&eacute; sex scenes if high school students read books like this one it would spark an unprecedented interest in history.  It is all here, the history of society before the war,  (men that came through the public school system in Britain were automatically conscripted to the army as 2nd Lieutenants, men that did not come through that system never advanced beyond the rank of Sergeant) the hard daily lives of the poor and working classes of Russia and Britain, the fight to gain women the right to vote and serve in public office, the events that followed the assassination, WW1 itself, the downfall of the Russian Empire and the birth of communism, the draconian Treaty of Versailles which Germany was forced to sign and consequently paved the road of no return to WW2, the Prohibition - all of these historical events are brilliantly woven with those of vivid fictional characters whose lives criss-cross with those that made the history of this period. As Follett so rightly points out if a novel encompassing such research and of this magnitude is not worth $20 he is indeed in the wrong business - and the poorer we would be for it.

0525423273|5.0|Taken from my blog:<br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" by Stephanie Perkins is a-freakin-dorable so READ IT NOW. There. That's all I need to say, right? Seriously though, this book is so fun and romantic. I do not normally like contemporary young adult fiction and I absolutely adore this book. I went out and bought a couple copies of it to give to my sisters and my best friend.<br /> Anna is sent away to Paris by her nouveau riche father (who is an author a la Nicolas Sparks..mwahaha, nice touch Ms. Perkins) for her senior year of high school in an effort to broaden her horizons and make him look super fancy. As if leaving her best friend and guy friend (def boyfriend potential) behind wasn't hard enough, she's thrown into the world of upper-crust snobbery in a country where she doesn't even speak the language! Luckily, she falls into a great group of friends and meets the perfect guy, Etienne St. Clair. He's a Parisian, whose also American, but has lived extensively in London so he has a British accent. Plus, add in the fact that he's an incredibly nice guy and is slowly becoming her best friend. Perfect right? Oh yeah, there's just one little hiccup - she's maybe-sorta-kinda taken by that potential boyfriend back home and he's in a long term relationship. Yowza.<br /> To be honest, the description of the book didn't have me convinced. As I said earlier, I'm not a big fan of contemporary YA. I'm more of a fantasy/paranormal/historical gal myself. I decided to take the plunge and give \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" 50 pages... if it hooked me, great, but if not, I'd go back to my comfort zone. It had me in less than five pages. The writing is just so sharp, fresh, and charming. I instantly loved Anna and Etienne. I cared so deeply about their happiness and let's face it, I'm always a sucker for best friend romances. (Yes, Twilight fans, I was unabashedly Team Jacob and will continue to pretend that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" never happened. Ugh.) For a teen romance, it is so wonderfully realistic too. It's so very real and sweet. There is no crazy love triangle. There is no lusty instant sexual connection. It's real world love and it's beautiful.<br />This book will have you saying \\"oo la la!\\" Seriously, I know I'm being a total cornball here, but I cannot stress enough that if you like LOVE, you will ADORE Stephanie Perkins' \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\". And if you don't like love, um, please go get help.ic too. It's so very real and sweet. There is no crazy love triangle. There is no lusty instant sexual connection.

B004CIIXC8|5.0|Andrea Arnold's \\"Fish Tank\\" is as startlng as it is realistic. Winner of many BAFTA Awards in '09, we finally have it here in the US. Kids aren't much different there as here, inasmuch as they know everything and rebel against authority. The amazing Katie Jarvis has a sense of grit and independence, that belies her 15 young years. I understand this is her first film, and she succeeds brilliantly. Michael Fassbender is handsome as ever, providing a profound catalyst for the goings-on. I won't give away any plot points, but it's a story about a kid who wants to grow up before her time, who's had no real childhood, who makes some bad choices. It's bleak and often unpleasant, and the ending is left to the viewer's concept of all that's gone before. The DVD has some great extras, especially Ms Arnold's Oscar-winning short, \\"Wasp\\", which is about concerned parenting, as \\"Fish Tank\\" is about bad parenting. All involved should be commended, especially Andrea Arnold. BAFTA has a separate category for Best BRITISH film, for which this was the winner. A few years ago they also awarded \\"This is England\\", also about rebellious youth, but not nearly as compelling. Much is due to Ms Jarvis' magnificent portrayal. It's hard to say I enjoyed it, but I have great admiration for the talents involved. This is a very low-budget film, so don't expect widescreen; it's like a personal odyssey, with little flash, generous close-ups, and a very personal narrative, almost like a family video. And what a family! Oy!

It could NOT cut through it at all! It only ripped the paper, while my Cold Steel trailmaster had cut through the paper with no problem, after I had batoned and chopped with it many times. My next test was chopping, and I was a LITTLE disappointed. I had chopped through 4 inches of maple in about 12-15 minutes, and my trailmaster had cut it in 10 minutes. All in all, great knife for the money.

We all know their music is faux-artsy crap now, right?  C'mon, people, just admit it.    These guys are not gods.  Just open your eyes and see them for what they are.  Faulty humans who couldn't live up to their potential so they just decided to go the \\"we're so creative and genius-like that we dare you to follow us into our murky world of nothing-ness and mumbly, blippy, gaget-y, computer world of non-music\\" route.  They're like an indie movie that thinks it's soooooo arty and cool and you try to keep up and understand what's going on but you know that the reason it doesn't make sense to you is because it doesn't make sense at all, but you're too afraid to admit that because you don't want anyone to think you're not cool so you bob your head and agree like a lemming who might as well be a fan of the next big budget pile of crap Hollywood pumps out weekly because you are no more original in thought than the average joe who consumes whatever is force fed to him/her anyway.    Radiohead's last few albums have all had the same crappy, crunchy, lo-fi plodding drums, melancholic \\"melodies\\", same isolated post-apocalyptic lyrics which are mumbled and jumbled and meaningless.    Maybe Radiohead is saying that rock music is meaningless.  Who gives a flying...ck.    The Bends, OK Computer, some of Kid A and Amnesiac were GREAT.  Then they just started believing in their own \\"myth\\" whatever that is.  In my HUMBLE OPINION, the myth is that their music doesn't suck.  It sucks.  Simple as that.  Rock music shouldn't be this boring.  Sorry, Boring with a capital B.

I was impressed by the amount of detail provided in this book, but I did not expect anything less from Mr. Delavier As with anything though, this should not be considered a \\"catch-all.\\" While quite a bit of information is presented, other books that focus on nutrition, fitness programs, and health should be considered as companions to this work.     I have not yet reviewed the latest edition of the work (3d. Edition, I believe), but I am sure that it is similarly satisfactory.    This book would be great for beginners, intermediate, and advanced athletes, as well as healthcare and fitness professionals. I would definitely recommend this!

0307454541|5.0|I found this book hard to put down.  However, I didn't realize that these books were a trilogy.  So I was in the middle of it before I started reading \\"the girl who played with fire\\".  I find the cultural behavior to be rather fascinating.  The Swedish population drinks more coffee than I do....or maybe it just seems that way since there is so much mention of coffee; and it appears that the ritual drink is coffee.  I'm in the middle of the next book of the trilogy and am sorry that there will be no more \\"Sally\\" and \\"Kalle.\\"
0887431453|5.0|The book is very clear and well illustrated.The exercises are right on the point and fun!This book keeps my 3 year old busy for a while.Learning and having fun we love it!Thanks again

B0021L8V0M|2.0|I just finished watching Salt. I know I am behind the times. I just must comment. The commercials made the film look interesting and exciting. Sadly, I was disappointed! It reminded me of a mix of Taken and The Bourne Trilogy. I found it bland and generic. I am glad I watched the rented DVD and didn't pay the going rate at a movie theater. Hopefully someone in Hollywould (that's the way I want to spell it) can come up with a better action film starring a female lead. If there is a part 2, I hope it is way better than this!! :0(
B00005RHGL|5.0|I have seen the movie before, and knew just how good it is.  The DVD i bought here was exactly as described as far as condition, being new.  It was still factory sealed.  Amazon never fails me, and i will be a repeat customer.

B004R36QUE|2.0|colin firth was far too old to play this character, with his double chin, saggy face and poorly died hair.  I couldn't bear to look at him.  i left wondering how much artistic license was taken with this \\"docudrama\\".  Indeed, I think it to be a work of pure fiction based on a skeleton of trutn.  The only reason this movie is receiving so much acclaim is that the mature movie goer has no choices, it's all comic book heroes and horror.  Sad state of affairs.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|so after reading reviews and hearing mixed emotions about these headsets and the whole dolby 7.1 come on people you got one midgrade speaker on each ear your not gonna get that much detail and i must say (GOOD) when i put them on they are light comfy maybe just a  little too loose and dont start to sweat around the ear muff area but (BAD)i notice if i move to quickly they will shut off possible bad design with battery compartment and as far as online they are horrible. constant static and mic cutting in and out one of the trouble shooting tips given at there website was to wiggle the wire to see if it gets worse. i started off with the x11 and they were awesome it is too bad that you would charge this much money for such a low grade piece of equipment. just a reciever in the headphones and instead of infared transmiter there is now a rf transmitter which interferes with the wifi connection on the xbox slim which was the whole purpose of getting these headphones since i needed some type of wireless headset with a optical input. since i just got done playing and had to get off due excesive crackling and mic dropping i must rant.  and now you come out with a new headset P5 charging more than the originally price for the x41 (notice everything looks the same except the new dye when they casted the plastic mold) did not fix any original problems just added bluetooth looks like to me turtlebeach is just a money hungry corporation losing one customer at a time just go to the trouble shooting guide at their website to see how many problems are associated with these headphones
B003ASLJO0|4.0|Had a few more scratches than I would expect for 'like new', however the dvd played flawlessly and with this vendor's lightening fast shipping I would buy again with confidence.
B0034G4OY0|5.0|I'm not going to go into the plot or the story, as that has been done enough here already, and you can look in other places online for that as well. I will say that this is an amazing movie, both the story and cinematography. Clint Eastwood is an excellent director/producer, and with Steven Spielberg and Matt Damon thrown into the mix you have a recipe for success. I don't understand the disappointment so many felt towards this movie, but I highly recommend it. It's not a fast paced thriller or action packed movie, but a serious movie meant to be taken and slowly digested. Do yourself a favor and watch it. I watched the streaming version while I wait for the Bluray to arrive. I can't wait for it to get here so I can watch it in High Def again and see what I missed the first time.

B003HLM2QO|1.0|There's one thing worse than death for a true artist - it is to compromise his own legacy. Ozzy has done it with this album. There's no need to really go through it or explain why for everybody who has got the ears and familiar with other Ozzy albums  can easily judge/hear it for themselves. Ozzy, I'm a true fan of yours who could easily die for everything you had done with Sabbath or solo up to the \\"Ozzmosis\\". Just please don't release stuff like this again. We will always remember and admire you for \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" or \\" Ultimate Sin\\". Just a side note for the producer - I wish I could meet this Kevin Churko guy and personally clean his ears with a screwdriver.
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|Device keeps dropping the signal.

I cannot use the device.
B000002LEM|4.0|This is not my favorite Van Halen album but it's my favorite with Sammy Hagar. Doesn't have the rock edge or hipness of the early Van Halen stuff, but the songwriting, at least as far as pop music goes, is a lot better.  Musicianship is polished and production is slick.<br /><br />Every song on here is pretty good. It's the last Van Halen album that I felt this way about, which may be part of why I kind of lost interest after this one. Or maybe I'm getting old?

B004R96SPQ|5.0|I have been in a bit of a book slump. I keep starting books and setting them aside to dabble in later and then I never pick them back up again. It's not that the books I have started haven't necessarily been good, I just wasn't in the mood or I couldn't give it enough time to get into it. Well that is over!<br /><br />If I Stay has brought my inner bookworm back to life. I opened it a few times before I actually read it, looking at the first line in an unfocused sort of way and then setting it back down. I finally decided that I just needed to get a few pages into it so when I was ready for work with five minutes to spare I decided I would use that time to get past those first few pages. I set it down, left for work, and then anxiously anticipated picking it up again because with just those few pages I could tell it was going to be good. When I got home I sat myself on the couch and didn't get up until the last page (and that doesn't happen to me very often).<br /><br />There is so much I love about this book; the music, the style, the emotions. I went from tearing up one second to laughing the next. The story was so tragic and heartbreaking but at the same time I wanted to be there. I wanted to know Mia and her parents, especially her hilarious parents with their perfect quirky adorableness. I just love this family.<br /><br />  \\"I did a slinky walk as best as I could in the heels. I expected Adam to go crazy when he saw me, his jeans-and-sweater girlfriend all glammed out. But he smiled his usual greeting, chuckling a bit. `Nice costume,' was all he said.<br />  `Quid pro quo. Only fair,' I said, pointing to his Mozart ensamble.<br />  `I think you look scary, but pretty.' Teddy said. `I'd say sexy too but I'm your brother so that's gross.'<br />  `How do you even know what sexy means?' I asked. `You're six.'<br />  `Everyone knows what sexy means,' he said.\\"<br />  -page 97<br /><br />I am in love with this book and I know there will be more Gayle Forman in my future...soon...seriously I already have another one waiting for me. Don't be jealous.ave another one waiting for me. Don't be jealous.

B00004RFFI|4.0|Twister may seem like a simple movie, but it really makes for a great action film.  The movie is directed by Jan de Bont (Director of Speed).  Twister is a non-stop action film about storm chasers who are trying to use a new technology to put sensors into a tornado and obtain scientific data on how tornadoes form.  The special effects are pretty good for the late nineties.    The most memorable time I saw this movie was at the theater with my mom and towards the end of the film a tornado warning went out in the area because a funnel cloud was spotted about a mile away.  We had to leave the theater!  It definitely made for an intense experience!      I think Twister is a well made movie with a fun story, good effects, great sound, and a cast that you will cheer for!  I have lived in Tornado Alley (Nebraska to north Texas) and the movie is well made.    Hold on!
0307394549|5.0|I'm a caterer, and always provide a bag of cookies to my clients as a special treat. This book was a great find, and I'm now working my way through the most interesting recipes so as not to get bored with repetitive cooking (and with taste-testing!) The recipes I've tried so far have all been delicious, and I especially love the creative ideas for packaging the cookies that are included in the book. I've tried about 20 recipes so far, and they've all been easy to follow and fun to make. A great book for any baker, professional or not!
0439023491|4.0|I should start off by saying that I read the first book, and loved it. It had these really deep, interesting concepts, a whole new take on romance, and was filled with lots of fast-paced, action-packed sequences. A total thought provoker, but this one? Yes and... well, it's Katniss's fault, really...<br /><br />The first part of the book felt like Katniss was really just moping about, being overly angsty and indecisive (which would be understandable, if she wasn't like this ALL OF THE TIME). Miss Collins doesn't go nearly as in-depth with the dynamic of her relationships with Gale and Peeta, or even their victory tours, as she could have. To be honest, at the end of the first book, I was so excited when I found out they were going on the victory tour. In fact, I thought this was going to be pretty much the central focus of the book when I first heard about it, leading up to their discovery of District 13. It's a small let-down, however--having only one real action scene. I would give part 1 a 3ish. Only because there were some pretty interesting discoveries and plot twists that made up for the overall dullness of seeing Katniss mope about her home district.<br /><br />Part 2 was when things really started moving along. It was like, part 1 had some really cool things tossed in there, but it was kind of difficult to look past it all with Katniss. Here, it gets better. She still mopes, but here you get more of a look at the politics and some really interesting side characters come back into the picture. I won't say too much about it, but there was one scene where Katniss did a little something with her arrow. And another when Peeta was having a certain interview. I definitely started seeing some more of the things I loved back in book one. Here, it got a 4... maybe even a five for what happened at the very end of it.<br /><br />Part 3? I was in heaven. Everything that I loved about the Hunger Games? It was back. And yes, it was amazing. This part gets a 4, borderline 5. Katniss, as always, brings it down. Depth she has, somewhat. But she's just too... blah, too indecisive, too static of a character, and not enough womanly strength, independence, etc.<br /><br />So, the Pros? Peeta: he is such a sweetheart--if Katniss doesn't want him, I will totally take him. The politics (though not entirely unexpected, they were interesting and well done--bravo, Miss Collins). The arena: the entire dynamic of it is just so interesting. I don't know what I would do without the arena!<br /><br />The Cons? Katnisss. Oh, my God. Katniss? Suck it up. Be. A. Woman.<br /><br />Basically, if you can get past the irritating, indecisive nature of Katniss then you will love this book. (She does some pretty cool things in the Hunger Games that would almost redeem her--if she would actually act some ounce of the woman that I know she has the potential to be!) That and some of the duller parts where she is just hanging around in her home District. But besides that, read it. It is well worth your time. I promise. Really, I do! :). Katniss, as always, brings it down. Depth she has, somewhat. But she's just too... blah, too indecisive, too static of a character, and not enough womanly strength, independence, etc.<br /><br />So, the Pros?

0316098337|2.0|I had a hard time reviewing this book, mainly because I think the story, and the way it was written was quite imaginative, and want to rate it higher because of that. But ultimately I need to rate books based on whether I actually enjoy the reading...not that the story itself has to be light (and of course this is anything BUT light), but that I take something away from it, whether it be the beauty of the prose, the uniqueness of the themes or even just characters I fall in love with. This story really had none of those. Characters are not well fleshed out (and actually are somewhat stereotypical despite the unusual circumstances the author put them in.) The writing is clunky and uneven...and yes I realize the narrator is only five, but it seems like Donahugh is trying to force him to sound like a child, then forcing him to sound like an overly pretentious child, then forcing him to sound like an adult, all within a few pages. I just didn't believe in him as a real character.    I also thought the plot dragged on a bit, despite the fact this is not an overly long book. Perhaps if I'd enjoyed the language more I wouldn't have felt that way, but by the time I was halfway done I was ready for the book to end. Maybe also I wouldn't have been so disappointed if my expectations hadn't been raised so high by the hype. I really expected to be carried away by the story, but instead I was just waiting for it to end. I'm sorry I can't recommend this book, but obviously others feel differently, so it's definitely worth checking out at the library or borrowing from a friend. I just personally regret having spent the money on it.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|All the songs on the album is good. I am sooo glad that i decide to buy this cd at a great price. If you are a fan of Jennifer Hudson, then you have to get this cd. Keep up the good work Jennifer.
0756404738|5.0|what can I say? The prose is beautiful, the timing masterful,and the characters drawn with such fine detail that you can see the whiskers on Kvothe's face. Sure there are a few to many little coincidences and some obvious contrivances. Sex is a big part of this book, but to a 17year old boy, (who is the main protagonist in this book) sex takes up the majority of their brainspace. To those who dislike sex, and beauty, this will be a disappointment. Get a life, honestly. To those who dislike 17 year old boys, I say: ... well I can't say in this particular forum.   No the \\"plot\\" doesn't go anywhere much. But this is descriptive fiction, and there is so little of that in the fantasy genre. I understand the plot driven book and really enjoy them and crave the plot to move faster, and despise the author when the plot bogs down. But this is not that kind of book. Read the words, follow their cadence. You will quickly read that much of the conversation with the fae is a poem, written like a sentence. You need to read the songs - they are important. Normally I skip the poems and songs 'cause they do little for the plot and are often not very good. These are good.   Ride the wave that Patrick creates and your journey will be pleasant and enjoyable. Don't look too hard at the plot diversions and the coincidences they wobble a bit under close scrutiny. Buck the wave, and you'll end up wet, cold, and far from your destination.   Enjoy!  Raj
B004LFO0ME|1.0|I didnt delete this review but im gonna say this, Im not writing it over. Whoever deleted this doesnt want others to know the truth. This album is Trash, and I think Wiz smoked too much he cant even make a hit song. He got lucky with Black n Yellow because of Pittsburg. I dissapointed listening to this crap. I thought he was going to come with something other than this boring, weed riddin, bubblegum tryna sound like he's knowledgable crap. Do not buy, im serious.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I have had an FM transmitter from Radio Shack which had so much static that I threw it away. I listen to audiobooks on my Sansa Clip while driving with one earbud (can't legally use two at once.) Because of road noise, I have to raise the volume, which I am afraid will hurt my hearing. The Sound Fly plays into my FM receiver with no static, almost as good as a DVD, and I don't have to use the earbud. The one drawback is that I have the Sansa Clip plugged into a 12v power adapter, and if I have the power adapter connected, the Sound Fly will not transmit a signal. So I have to keep the battery charged on the Sansa. I can't understand why the power adapter interferes with the Stereo Fly, as it works with headphones very well.     I am ordering another one for my wife.

B001EOOQF6|5.0|Mob Rules had a tough act to follow.  People loved Heaven and Hell, which was seen as Tony Iommi's triumphant return to world-class songwriting, riffing, and soloing.  After some initial resistance, Dio was accepted by fans as the band's new frontman, paving the way for a full-fledged Sabbath comeback.  Years later, we all know they more than lived up to the expectations by writing one of the truly classic albums in heavy metal/hard rock history.<br /><br />Nothing from the versatile Sabbath repertoire is left out on this masterpiece.  If you want classic, unrivaled riffs, Voodoo, The Sign of the Southern Cross, The Mob Rules, Country Girl, and Falling off the Edge of the World offer them in abundance.  If you want epic songwriting, try The Sign of the Southern Cross and Over and Over.  Signature Iommi solos?  They're all over the place.  There really aren't any holes in this album.<br /><br />As everyone knows, Mob Rules marks Vinny Appice's beginning with Black Sabbath.  While this unavoidably gives a different feel to the songs, it doesn't detract from them.  Appice himself has stated in many interviews that he has a more straightforward, standard rock style than Bill Ward, which was a more logical fit anyway for the direction Iommi was headed with the songwriting.  That just leaves Geezer's bass, which is as essential as ever to the core Sabbath sound, and Dio, whose vocals are too good for reviewing; really, what would be the point?  If you're a Sabbath fan and don't already have this album, do yourself a favor.  Get it yesterday.
1591843790|5.0|Since reading Guy's book I've purposely been bringing the ideals from the book to almost every encounter and have tremendously enjoyed a noticeable shift in reactions from people.  I'm not saying I've been 'transformed' magically to any degree, but I will say having personal confidence in my own attitude and transparency of my intentions has not only been noticed by the people I've been talking to, but actually embraced to the point of those folks going out of their way to tell me how much they appreciated the honesty, sincerity and approach.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book.  Even better, it's something I'm glad to now know.

B002GJT4YQ|5.0|This was a much more realistic price (26.95 + 2.99 shipping) considering the time the edition has been relased.  This \\"Ultimate\\" version has a 3rd new disc and the \\"extended version\\" of the movie, which is missing in the later issues of the Ultimate Editions (3 and following....don't buy them, it's not worth it.)  However 1 and 2 are well worth it.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I saw this movie because I thought it was some sort of sci/fy adventure and it looked interesting.  Turns out it was certainly an interesting movie but not for the reasons I'd imagined.  Never Let Me Go is basically a romance cloaked in the guise of a future world/clone tale.  In some ways it reminded me of Blade Runner with its characters in search of a 'deferment' the same way those 'skin jobs' were looking for a way to add to their alloted years. But while Blade Runner characters were scary and clever, the characters in Never Let Me Go are gentle and so wanting of a future.  I found the movie heart breaking in its vulverability and hopeful in a way, too.  The acting was very understated and quiet, very gentle.  I wish some time had been spent on explanation, but then that's because those are the kind of movies I like - the ones that have explanations, even crazy ones.  Still, I was happy to have spent time with these sad, misled characters.

B000000WCA|5.0|1996 was a year I remember as not a particularly great one culturally,at least from where I stood. There'd been too many self important years where it seemed that the backstory and historical credibility of a group or soloist mattered a lot more than the music itself. Right around the same time Ginger,Posh,Sporty,Baby and Scary Spice entered my life this group seemed caught up in the same situation. So many people caught up in modern rock really liked them a lot but never wanted to admit to it publically. The result is the exact same thing that happened to The Carpenters and ABBA before them: The Spice Girls got caught in the whole \\"pop is evil\\" syndrome that sometimes afflicts many artists. Either way I don't care who did or didn't write,produce or developed this group in the first place-all that mattered and still does to me is on a personal level how this helped me enjoy new music again,at least for awhile and on a related matter how high a quality the writing and the music is on this album.<br /><br />  Take away all the karate kicks,sloganeering and such away this is for all intents and purposes a late 90's pop/R&B/funk/disco album with a lot of sleek production elements,some very distinct and unique singing and a decidedly retro flavor. The album,in true pop music form begins in the best way possible with it's three biggest hits.At it's time \\"Wannabe\\" is the more commercial of the hits off this album and the only one that might actually qualify as bubblegum. Next is the song that hooked me-the shiny funk/disco stylings of \\"Say You'll Be There\\",complete with a great harmonica solo,phat synth bass line and one of the most complex constructed melodies I'd heard in a pop record in a long time. \\"2 Become One\\" and \\"Mama\\" are two more hit's,both equally well crafted especially with their actually mildly jazzy harmonies. Aside from the kicking,faced paced retro disco of \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" this album is rounded out with some surprisingly streetwise and funky hip-hop/R&B grooves such as \\"Love Thing\\",\\"Last Time Lover\\",\\"Something Kinda Funny\\",\\"If You Can't Dance\\" and especially \\"Naked\\",which is very slinkly and seductive.<br /><br />  Looking back on what these times seemed to forcefeed us as having \\"relevence\\" and \\"integrity\\" the music The Spice Girls made has definately withstood the test of time and I will say I don't find them a guilty pleasure at all. I will always adore this album. It's completely non self conscious and basks in a playful and honest atmosphere. These are all wonderful songs that have an excellent mix of live and electronic instruments,have a human sounding production and look to the many funk and disco hybrids of the late 70's and early 80's for it's primary musical inspiration,apparently someone involved hoping that this once neglected sound would sweep the pop charts at this point if the Spices were promoted properly and in that case they were a big success. So keeping this in mind listen,dance,sing along and enjoy the music exactly for what it is as opposed to how your directed by the culture surrounding you. Good quality music of all sorts such as this will have a better effect on people if they did that a little more.with some surprisingly streetwise and funky hip-hop/R&B grooves such as \\"Love Thing\\",\\"Last Time Lover\\",\\"Something Kinda Funny\\",\\"If You Can't Dance\\" and especially \\"Naked\\",which is very slinkly and seductive.

0670022411|4.0|All in all I love this book. I loved the magic,the science,the history and the settings. This is a love story between a witch and a vampire and so much more. The main character Diana was a little much but I loved all the others and there are many. This was the first book in a LONG time that I hated to put down and could not wait to get back to the adventure. I am looking forward to the next two books in the All Souls Trilogy.
B000000WFF|5.0|I really don't know if anyone expected the Spice Girls to follow up their debut so fast and so well but they did. By this time Spicemania had hit full blast. Their videos were all over the place,their were dolls of them in Toys R Us and indeed for anyone who thought of them as \\"pure marketing\\" during this time were certainly not being proven otherwise by the heavy hype surrounding them. Either way there was a lot to be excited about for those who stuck with them. They were about to make a feature film,a goofy self deprecating comedy to which this album served as a soundtrack and shared a title. Needless to say this album would represent a good deal of creative growth for them as they decided to up every possible ante of their debut and create an album that in turn was more musically and thematically diverse than the one that came before.<br /><br />  This album is filled to the brim with show stoppers. Again the album is front loaded with hits,all excellent and that all emphasize the groups stylistic growth. The title track opens up the affair with a bang with a high octane salsa number where \\"Stop\\",one of my favorites pays homage to The Supremes with a Motown-via-Culture Club style pop/R&B tune. \\"Too Much\\" is a 60's style Southern Soul ballad with a lyric that's actually sort of touching. Again their are a series of harder funk/hip-hop style numbers but this time they are a bit more aggresive such as on \\"Saturday Night Divas\\",\\"Move Over\\",\\"Do It\\" and \\"Denying\\"-all of which showcase a more genuine showcase for their \\"girl power\\" concept. One of the best songs here is the spirited retro disco \\"Never Give Up On A Good Thing\\" with an influence of Dee Lite and Jamiroquai all over it to top off on. This time the album closes with two more popular hits-the epic ballad \\"Viva Forever\\" and the caberet jazz styled \\"The Lady Is A Vamp\\",a song likely the concoction of Geri \\"Ginger Spice\\" Halliwell  considering her future solo direction.<br /><br />  After this album the group would split up and everyone seemed to think that The Spice Girls had peaked too early and just exploded out of existence. Even though they would come back four years later things would never quite be the same. They seemed to have a great momentum going early on in their career and a full future ahead of them but they didn't seem to have as easy a go of it personally as...well the last huge British group to have this level of commercial success. Although because they never developed the same sort of musical adulation as the Fab Four was to their advantage because they didn't have to contend with having the musical pressures that came with that. Now one can speculate what might've happened if they'd kept up this momentum-who knows maybe they'd have developed the \\"credibility\\" that seemed to define even pop stars at this point in time. But things just trailed off for different personal reasons and we're left with these two albums as a reminder of when The Spice Girls ruled the world.irection.

0156029065|5.0|I picked up the audio version of this book and absolutely adored it. George Guidall does a especially fantastic job with this one.<br />This book is very accessible compared to some of Eco's books. As much as I have enjoyed Name Of The Rose and others, this book is the only one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.

B004L49K20|5.0|This IS the masterpiece the DDs have been working toward.  Thank You Mark Ronson.  This brings everything together and is quite genius.  If you have interest in Duran Duran purchase this and you wil be very pleased.  As a fan I am so very proud!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|It's just OK.  Two things it will not do:  1) will not play the audio bird songs in a kindle book and 2) the NOA dictionary does not function with the books.  Both of these functions work on the Ipad.  Zero reason to release software that is not ready to live in the real world.  This app requires a trip to the internet to look up words at Dictionary.com!  A bit lame - especially if you have wi-fi turned off.
B003ZSI9YI|4.0|I love Motown...No, I LOVE Motown. So I approached this album with deep trepidation. The charts are wonderful, there are some neat twists without moving away from the originals. I'm not a huge fan of Collins, but this is a clearly warm, loving and even important tribute to the music that literally shaped a generation.
B0000067L3|5.0|I bought this when I was a teenager in the late '60s. Loved it, of course. When it was available in the late '80's  on CD I bought it but since then it was never enhanced with outtakes or anything. Good God, think of all the (stupid) albums that have been \\"Deluxed\\" but this one isn't??????   Five stars for musical quality. Zero for attention to making it the classic it should be.  I just got the \\"Rope Ladder to the Moon\\" DVD about Jack Bruce. Fantastic!!! Cream fans: get this!   Oh well. Thought The Ramones were fantasic too, but at least their catalog is done justice.  Bye  Eddie
0316069485|1.0|I have never been disappointed by a Michael Connelly novel before (and I've read them all).  So even when I didn't think The Reversal was going anywhere, I kept reading and thinking it would improve on the next page.  By the end of the book, I felt as though I'd wasted my time.  Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller are two of my favorite characters, but combining them in one book seemed to dilute their strengths.  The plot never really never woke up.  The last page of this story felt more like the beginning of a completely different story.  A big disappointment.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|I rented this movie because I was simply bored and was not ready to watch another big name movie.  Saw this on the Amazon hand picked list and figured this will be a cheesy way to pass the time.  I figured what's he going to do bring a laser gun into Viking times and blast Aliens.  Well I was extremely pleased with the effects story line and ending of this movie.  NOTHING WAS OVER THE TOP and didn't try to be something it wasn't. (Didn't try to be \\"epic\\" and failed feeling)It didn't try to have a political message, was not some cheap cliche action movie (like Vin Diesel movies or Jason Statham) or anything like what you expect from smaller limited release movies.  It was simply a good movie, great story, and well rounded.  I like the fight scenes, the effects, the sci fi was believable and the \\"dragon\\" was something cool looking but yet still had that nasty \\"Alien\\" (Sigourney Weaver) bad ass killer effect. If your looking for a movie with action/sci fi/viking blend without having to tolerate and extreme stretching of your imagination then this is your movie. LOL    I stress that I hate over the top Sci-Fi and action if the guy is leaping 30 yards and shooting rockets from his wallet, I would not even bother writing a review.     The short version. Thoroughly enjoyed and I am sad that its not more well known. Pleasantly surprised, by the plot and action.

0670022411|5.0|I had some trepidation about reading this book as I am definitely not into vampires in any shape or form. So I started reading it very carefully and before I knew it I was hooked! I was telling my librarian friend about the book and she asked,'What did you especially like the plot, the characters, the setting?' and I answered, 'All of them!!'. As my title said Wow!!! As I was coming to the end of the book I tried to read slower and slower because I didn't want it to finish. Though as I read it I could tell that surely this was the beginning of a trilogy, if not more! But as this was the first one, I wondered how LONG would I have to wait for the next. I surely hope that Ms Harkness is a fast writer, though with her attention to detail there is probably no hope of the next one soon!  As to the reviews that compare this with Harry Potter I somewhat agree except this is a 'grownup' Harry Potter. I imagine J.K. Rowling would love to get together with Deborah Harkness. They surely must use some comparable writing techniques, as the amazing facts and background are mind boggling.  Also referring to the less than 5 star reviews, I can't imagine who these individuals are,  they must come from an alternate universe, where excellence is not appreciated.

B001CTDH76|5.0|'The Mentalist' is a rare gem in the procedural-show genre. It's not as scientific as 'CSI' or 'House' nor as realistic as 'The Wire' or even 'Law and Order'. What 'The Mentalist' lacks in realism and work-bound logic it makes up for with entertainment value, using the likeability and charm of it's characters and plot to carry each episode.  I wasn't sure what to think about this show going in, but after watching this first season DVD set I have to say 'The Mentalist' is one of the most engaging shows on TV.<br /><br />After the death of his wife and child at the hands of serial killer 'Red John' (whom he publically mocked), celebrity psychic Patrick Jane admitted to being a fraud and is now a consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (a fiction version of the real CBI). Joined by senior agent Lisbon, the dry-humored agent Cho, the spiritual newbie agent Van Pelt, and the likeably insecure agent Rigsby, Jane uses his abilities in observation and deduction (cold-reading and even hypnotism) to help the team solve homicides. Most of the plots play out episodically with Jane's vengeful search for the killer 'Red John' popping up here and there as the series goes on. Each episode is convoluted enough to be interesting and each self-contained story is resolved in a beliveable manner (with some moral ambiguity) and not always with easy solutions. This show wisely doesn't judge it's characters or situations (for the most part) allowing the audience to sometimes judge things for themselves.<br /><br />One of the best parts of 'The Mentalist' is watching how the characters interact and the cast really sells it. Simon Baker is very charismatic as Jane and his performance is so finely tuned (check out how his eyes dilate in close-ups) you'd swear you were watching a real mentalist at work. Robin Tunney has her best role in Senior Agent Lisbon, someone who's annoyed by Jane's arrogance but respects him as a colleuge and even trusts him as a friend. Tim Kang is dead-pan (and very funny) as the down-to-earth Agent Cho. Amanda Righetti is perfect as the spiritual Van Pelt, a great contrast to Jane's methodical approach to psychic-abilities. Welsh actor Owain Yeoman is fun to watch as the likeable Rigsby, especially with him trying to keep a relationship with Van Pelt. Most of these characters do fit some archetype of the procedural show, but there's enough unique (and again, believable) about each one that each episode is a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />While it might not seem like a big deal, the one thing that really sets 'The Mentalist' apart is it's filming on location all around California. We're not stuck in enclosed labs or hospital rooms, no claustrophobic office spaces to try and sell realism. Each location in the show is visually appealing like you're taking a road trip with these characters. It's nice when a show can stretch it's legs and NOT make you feel like you're just watching people work. That 'The Mentalist' still manages to keep it's believability is impressive indeed.<br /><br />I keep mentioning the 'believability' in 'The Mentalist' but I'm by no means saying it's realistic, in fact it has a lot of the same pitfalls as other procedurals: The actors are obviously way too attractive to be in this profession (especially the way the they dress), Jane gets away with breaking the rules (and being a jerk) waaaaay too much, side-characters seem too dense (especially other law-enforcement officers) and for a procedural show there's almost no PROCEDURE involved (no clear-cut laws or rules to follow). Even the idea of using a fake-psychic isn't exactly original ('Psych' anyone?).<br /><br />'The Mentalist', created by Bruno Heller (who also created HBO's excellent 'ROME' series) is far from the most realistic and original show on TV. However it's crafted much better than just about any other procedural out there (the BBC's Sherlock comes the closest in my mind) and it's clever stories, appealing locales and charming characters make it perfect escapist entertainment. A real winner and one of the best shows on TV!ainment. A real winner and one of the best shows on TV!

B004G6009U|5.0|In the tradition of animated love stories like, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" Disney strikes another successful cord in \\"Tangled.\\" Not giving too much away, a baby girl is forced to live her life in a hidden tower under the cunning rule of her selfish mother. Years later, a handsome would-be thief stumbles on the hidden nest and before long becomes smitten over the beautiful young lady with long golden magical hair. Despite warnings from her wretched mother, the golden hair beauty and the handsome thief escape the tower. Their adventure leads to young love and the discovery of a long lost hidden secret. This is a great movie for children and adults. \\"Tangled\\" is a must for a home movie library especially if you have gone 3-D. 3-D lovers will not be disappointed. Blu-ray lovers will certain enjoy the bright vivid colors and crispness of the high definition. 7.1 audio is good but seems lacking a little on 5.1. I rate this movie 7 potato more on blu-ray 3-D.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Why? get all that great music into digits, before you can't find a product this great!  Japan products remind me of the US 50 years ago, they make stuff that works and works well as well as holds up for a long time!
B004HAEGP4|2.0|I wish this 4th installment of Res Evil was better - especially considering how amazing the first 3 were.  I was more than excited for another chapter of Res Evil - but this movie is awful.  Maybe it would have been great in 3D at the theater, but I am reviewing the DVD.  I thought the plot was weird and non-existent, the zombies sucked, the storyline was boring and hard to follow and some of the acting was almost painful to watch.  I actually bought this DVD, watched it, then immediately put it up for sale.  Maybe if you were a die-hard Res Evil video game fan, or read the books, you would like it.  For the solely movie fan like myself - it was a big disappointment.  At least I have the first 3 to re-watch.

B003YOMNCM|3.0|Hilary is a genuine phenom. She is consummately talented and gracious in the video interview I have seen.  She spoke in such a way as to put Higdon (at least by implication) on equal footing with Tchaikovsky.  Gracious to a fault it seems.      Been waiting to hear this for nearly two years.  Bought the trailers from Amazon, should have stopped there.  Having heard Higdon's  percussion concerto live here in Phoenix, as far as I'm concerned Higdon's got an \\"O fer two\\" going.  Higdon is much too prominent in the piece which to me was cluttered and meanderingly pointless!!!    Then it ends, it just stops, the train jerks to a halt and we left to find our way home.  We were taken nowhere, saw little and heard almost nothing.  Sad indeed that such talent should take second place to the composer!!    Sophie Mutters Tchaikovsky is much better!! If you like Hilary's it's because you haven't heard Sophie Mutter. She was tentative in some passages, I think she was shell shocked by Higdon intrusion frankly.  I much prefer the Barber and Meyer album to this piece.  I simply don't know when she did the Tchaikovsky piece so the time line may not support my contention.     Personally I think Hilary is an American Institution, who's talent was hijacked by Jennifer Higdon.  The three star rating is in support of her overwhelming talent.

B0041KKYCY|4.0|I loved this film! It wasn't necessarily terrifying, but it was full of gory justice.  I've never seen the original film that inspired this remake, but I did enjoy it.  My attraction to this film stems from its basic idea of a victim getting their own revenge against those that brutalized them.  The story is about a woman that was raped and beaten by a group of men, somehow she survived and starts murdering them very creatively.  Each of the deaths of the men is inspired by his own actions during her rape/attack.  I would reccomend watching this, it's a great film.  I don't think I've ever watched a horror film, where I sided with the murdered.
B003LZ5B7S|4.0|Overall, I recommend Watching the whole series back to back as the continuity is great. As a review of just this episode its good but as a compliment to series as a whole its great and is a great start. If you can get through this one they get better and better as time goes on.
0385341679|5.0|Oh what a ride this has been!!! After the agony of that cliffhanger ending in DreamFever, I just knew Shadowfever had to be amazing. No author would leave her fans hanging like that unless she knew the finale was going to be magnificent. And it was. The final installment of Mac's story was everything I wanted it to be. Mac's long and winding trail to find the Sinsar Dubh was a twisting, turning, sometimes upside down and inside out journey. So many times in the previous books, Mac would pepper Barrons with questions, and he would tell her that when she didn't need to ask anymore he would like to know her then. Mac finally became that woman, and I liked her a lot.<br /><br />And Barrons, oh Barrons...we get to see Barrons like we've never seen him before, and I loved it. We learn some of his secrets (and they're doozies!), and we finally get to see what's under the garage!!! Barrons has been \\"my guy\\" from the beginning and that did not change at all in Shadowfever.<br /><br />My favorite highlander (and lie-detector), Christian MacKeltar, is one of the few unfinished story lines in the book. All I can say is \\"WTF? I did NOT see that coming.\\" (Luckily, KMM said in her Q&A that we will be seeing Christian in future books).<br /><br />I'll admit I was never \\"Team V'lane\\" and Shadowfever did not change my mind.<br /><br />And Dani - You know, Dani has been one of my least favorite characters throughout the series. She really shone in Shadowfever though - she had some of the funniest lines in the book. Her story isn't finished either and I never thought I'd say this but I'm actually looking forward to the telling of it.<br /><br />Everyone else:<br />I loved Barron's \\"Band of Merry Men\\". They were so testosterone-filled and angry. They were mad, bad men and I couldn't help but like them. I'd love to hear their story. I laughed out loud at the scene where Mac's mother talked about how she cooked for them and what they liked to eat. And when Lor propositioned Mac - wow, just...wow. The MacKeltars are back, and there's a cameo by Adam from Ms. Moning's Highlander series, which was nice. Fiona was a bitch to the very end. As far as Dreamy-Eyed Guy - I had a theory about DEG, and I was wrong. He surprised me.<br /><br />There are just enough loose ends that I'm looking forward to whatever spin-off Ms. Moning decides to write, but not so many that I'm left feeling unfulfilled.<br /><br />All told, I love Mac's growth through the series and this book in particular. She questioned herself constantly. She analyzed and made lists. She got scared. She got mad. She was epic. Ms. Moning said from the beginning that Mac's story would ultimately be a happy one, that things would be dark before they got light, and she was right.<br /><br />A tip of the hat to you, Ms. Moning.

This was a great purchase and highly recommend it.

0374290024|3.0|In this book Morris attempt to explain world's history using a few simple concepts to make a simple model of how history works. While any attempt to understand world history using simple concepts is bound to be incomplete any attempt to understand history without the use of models is bound to result in tens of thousands of pages and no theory of the workings of the world.    His thesis is that the West came to dominate the world because of geography:    1 - It has access to the best conditions in the world for the flourish of early civilization, including access to 3 continents and hence a great biological diversity of animals useful for humans, like cows, dogs, sheep, horses, etc.    2 - The mediterranean sea, right at the doorstep of the fertile crescent, is a free transport network that enabled western civilization to gain another advantage over earlier civilizations. Enabling the Roman empire to be the first civilization to reach the hard limit of agrarian development. However, he said that when one civilization reaches the limits of development, they decline and fall.    3 - The continual reaching and re-reaching of the limits of agrarian development enabled the west to accumulate knowledge, that increased the set of technologies while agriculture and settled populations advanced over the world. So Europe in the 18th century, when they returned to the same level of development that the Romans had reached 1700 years before, had accumulated much greater knowledge than the Romans had.    4 - Also being near the Americas enabled Europe to exploit the trading opportunities that Asia never had. This, combined with the closing of the steppe highway enabled European social development to surpass all the rest of the world and take off into an industrial revolution. The industrialized west was now able to attack anywhere in the world and impose their will over any country, including the once über-powerful China.    My criticism of the book is over several problems:    1- First, while I agree that geography is a major determinant of history, it fails to explain several aspects of history. The human factor is very important, for instance, Alexander III of Macedon, also called The Great, is a man that changed history alone. While he apparently thinks that the defeat of Persia was the product of historical forces greater than any single men. It also fails to explain why Britain became the first industrial country and not Spain or France. The difference is that Spanish and French monarchies were deeply entrenched and blocked entrepreneurial activity while Britain's weak monarchy produced a more favorable environment for the merchant class to gain political influence and protect their interests, which would in effect increase the rewards for entrepreneurial activity, increasing the incentives for technological innovation. While the Roman Empire, for instance, had the policy to kill any creative inventor because his inventions would destroy current industries (i.e.. destroy jobs).    2 - I think that China never had the chance of really surpassing the west. Even when the west was in their dark ages, some estimated for the year 1000 say that the Byzantine Empire's per capita income was still the highest in the world. While estimates for the rate of urbanization of China, for example, shows that in the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty, the rate of urbanization was 5%, about the same as Europe in 1200 CE and nothing spectacular for a pre-modern civilization. While Northern Italy had reached the rate of urbanization of 25% by the 15th century, hence was the most urbanized part of the world and the richest in per capita income. Roman Italy had estimated rates or urbanization of 30%, while Ancient Greece had estimated rates of urbanization of 30% also.    3 - He puts the early Roman Empire as the peak in terms of social development for the ancient west. Modern research is apparently showing that in Classical Greece living standards were even better. Perhaps even better than mid 19th century European: the Athenian could buy 13.6 kg of wheat working a single day in 430 bc (1 medimnos: 52.9 liters of wheat, price medimnos 3 wage/days, density of wheat 770 grams per liter) while the Roman Egyptian of the year 100 could buy only 4 kg. For comparison the Briton of 1825 could buy 8.6 kg. The Chinese of 1750 could buy only 2.25 kg, and the Indian of the same year, only 2.3 kg. The average Greek lived in a house of 3,000 square feet of roofed space (according to modern archaeological research), the average American house today is 2,300 feet. Still, the ancient Greeks didn't have much technology, compared to the Romans and specially compared to 19th century Europe. Living standards aren't a linear function of technology. He also says that democracy had nothing to do with western lead. Plain absurd, all advanced societies were democracies to a certain extent. Societies where the people don't affect the power of a despotic emperor are societies without developed information networks. And classical civilization started to stagnate and decline when Rome ceased to be republic and became an empire and all Greek city states were dissolved in the 4th century CE (yes, there were inside the roman empire hundreds of city states, some were democracies, at least until the empire became centralized in the 4th century CE and regional autonomy was cut off).    4 - Europeans began dominating the seas of the world around the same time they discovered America. In those years that global power projection became a reality and not in the 19th century. Europeans didn't discover America because they were nearer, as they also traveled to China in the 16th century and established a colony there, Macao. Opium wars were only the last phase of a process of colonization. They started traveling all around the world in the 16th century when their maritime technology overcame the difficulties of sea travel, the first civilization to do that.    5 -He also makes some strange comparisons and judgments. First he states that the Crusades weren't a threat to the powerful Islamic countries because the crusader states were wiped out after \\"only\\" 100 years! If some foreign country invaded the US today and managed to take some states but the US, which after 1 century of warfare, managed to reconquer the lost lands, that would be called a easy war? While stating that China was more powerful than Europe in the 16th century because they could execute some Portuguese sailor.    6 - The industrial revolution was not the consequence of the colonization of the Americas or the closing of the steppe highway. In societies ruled by despotic regimes under top down administration the quantity of information that the economic system is able to grasp is restricted to the quantity of information that the dictator's brain is capable of handling. In modern industrial societies information is dispersed over millions of independent minds that manage each part of the economy. The industrial revolution was only the application of the principle of individual liberty (that is also associated with democracy) over large territories, that enables autonomous decision making. This principle was first developed by the hellenes and that's from the west rule came from (yep, I am one of those long term lock in theorists).    7 - I don't need to comment on the part about the future.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|Once again this is a winner by Jodi Picoult.  This is my first Kindle version book to read.  I read it within two days.  As always, the author touches on controversial subject matter and includes a courtroom drama.  Although Ms. Picoults books can be predicted to be as such, she always delivers a very good story.<br /><br />In this story she tackles gay marriage and the custody battle of frozen embryoes.  The story is told from the points of view of our three main characters, Max, Zoe, and Vanessa.  Max and Zoe divorced and Zoe later fell in love with and married a woman, Vanessa.  Max and Zoe had tried to have children to no avail and were left with three frozen embryoes at the end of their marriage.  Zoe went on to fall in love with Vanessa and they were married and decided to try and have the embryoes implanted in Vanessa.  Here is where we contact the problem.<br /><br />Max, being an alcoholic, has gone to live with his brother and wife and joined their church.  He becomes devoted in his religion and it helps him through a very difficult time.  When Zoe asks for the unborn children, Max seeks guidance from his Pastor and what ensues is a court battle that becomes a political and religious form more than anything else.<br /><br />I feel the author has portrayed both sides of this issue tastefully, although the religious side was more of a way right sided view than you would find in many churches I know of.  I also came out of this with a sense of the struggle Gays deal with, yet the fundamental issue at stake here can not be ignored.  It would have been nice to have the views of some of the other caracters explored as well.<br /><br />In the end, it was a satisfying story and a very satisfying ending, although it would have been nice to tie things up for Lucy.
B004NSULHM|3.0|Radiohead's rather disappointing \\"The King of Limbs\\" is to \\"In Rainbows\\" as \\"Amnesiac\\" was to \\"Kid A\\": a subdued follow-up that seizes upon the quietest, most experimental elements of its predecessor and creates an entire album out of them. Of course, \\"entire album\\" may be something of an overstatement, given that \\"King of Limbs\\" has only eight songs -- at barely 37 minutes long, it's a brief and cryptic effort. With no true standout tracks, the album feels decapitated, as if the real album was supposed to have been 10 to 12 songs, with at least a few of them memorable. I enjoy moody, melancholy electronica as much as the next listener, but an overdose of it creates the sense of wandering into an obscure movie score, or just a library of outtakes. And there are no real breakthroughs here. The music on \\"The King of Limbs\\" isn't any more advanced or difficult than what the band has been doing since 2000; it's just less dramatic and melodically rich. These understated, pretty but low-energy tracks in the past would have supported the classic songs on a Radiohead album, not served as the entire album themselves. Imagine \\"Kid A\\" minus \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" \\"Optimistic,\\" and \\"Morning Bell.\\" If you'd love the resulting album, then you probably will enjoy \\"King of Limbs\\" quite a lot. But to me, the album feels like a Thom Yorke solo project that was released under the band's name, but on which the band as a working unit just didn't have much to do.
030726999X|5.0|I'm not sure if I'm suppose to review the book or the service but either way.. This is the third book in a series of three books. This book has such a great ending, it will ruin you for any book you read after. As for the service, the condition was as promised, the service was good and I got the book in a hurry just like I asked!
1591843790|5.0|I have been listening to Taylor Swift's great new CD Speak Now and the song Enchanted.  I bought the CD before Guy's book and I kept wondering \\"How is Guy Kawasaki going to write on the same subject?\\"  Here is the guy who calls out the bozos, tells us \\"don't make crap\\" and \\"that's bull shiitake!\\"  This enchantment word didn't seem like his thing...until I read the book. Now I get it. Enchantment is kind of a holistic roadmap to stepping up our game in the human race, to make cooler products, be better business people and make a better impression.  Guy gets people thinking that connecting goes beyond establishing rapport to something more visceral.  I guess that's why he chose the word 'enchantment.' It is a word with magical powers and people respond to enchantment.  Read this book.  Let go.  Do good.
159562015X|5.0|Every time I buy this book for someone, they are never disappointed.  There is so much to be gained for so little cost and time to be invested.  If you don't try this book yourself, you really are murdering an opportunity for real, personal growth.
B00466HN68|4.0|Imagine waking up on a train.  You don't know how you got there.  You don't know who the lady sitting across from you is, even though she seems to know you.  Your last memory is flying helicopters in Iraq.  Looking in the mirror you don't see your face...you see someone else.  Your driver's license says, \\"Sean\\" - not your name.  Then the train explodes and you are consumed in a ball of fire.  Only you don't die.  You wake up in a metallic chamber surrounded by wires, a screen on the wall.    Eventually a woman tells you that the train was real and had been bombed by terrorists who threatened to strike again.  The machine you are in is called the Source Code.  It lets you relive 8 minutes of someone's life, someone from the train, in a sort of alternate universe which mirrors our exactly.  Your mission is to discover the terrorist within the Source Code so that they can be stopped in your world before detonating a dirty bomb.  You will repeat the assignment until complete.    What do you do?        This is what happens to Coulter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall) in Source Code.  The lady across from him is Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who apparently knows Sean from the daily commute into Chicago.  Vera Farmiga plays Goodwin, the woman who gives Coulter instructions between jumps, and Jeffrey Wright plays Dr. Rutledge, the creator of the Source Code.    Duncan Jones directs this fast paced sci-fi thriller without ever losing sight of the plot or the characters.  With each jump back into the Source Code, we learn more about Coulter and about Christina.  Duncan also doesn't let supporting characters fade into the background too, as Goodwin is given plenty of opportunity for character development.    Out of all of the movies or TV shows to use the Groundhog Day effect, this is probably the best I've seen it used.  Usually this effect is random, and continues until the character makes the right choice, after which the story finally progresses outside of whatever time loop hasbeen created.  Groundhog Day is the most famous example of this, though I have seen several Star Trek episodes utilize the same technique.  It's almost a choose-your-own-adventure for the characters, especially since they soon realize death just starts the loop over again.    One of the great things Source Code does to break out of the clichés in this effect is the have an outside story.  Between loops, Coulter returns to the real world (I say real world for lack of a better word since an alternate reality could still be considered real).  His jumps happen after the actual terrorist bombing, and the terrorists promised to strike again.  This gives an excellent ticking clock in the script, and great incentive for the bomber to be found, because real lives are at risk.  Also, he is given only 8 minutes, which is an incredibly short length of time.  This helps ratchet up the tension as well.    The entire cast is excellent, giving their characters real emotion.  It is great to see the relationship between Coulter and Christina grow, even though at the beginning of each jump Christina is no longer aware of any developments.  Also, Goodwin agonizes over her ability to help Coulter.  Rutledge is her superior and seems to want Coulter more in the dark about full details surrounding the event that Goodwin thinks are necessary.    Coulter himself is just a great character.  His last memory is of being on active duty in Iraq.  Between then and waking up after his first time on the train in the Source Code there are no memories.  Since the Source Code is an identical/alternate reality he uses those 8 minutes on the train to not only try to search for the bomber, but also piece together what happened to him.    That said, there are weaker moments in the story.    The first is that after returning from his first time on the train, Coulter is almost immediately sent back and is told to find the bomb.  Goodwin and Rutledge don't want to waste time - they need to find the terrorist.  However, it isn't until a couple of jumps later that they finally tell Coulter why they need to find the bomb.  Until that point, he thinks it's just a training simulation.  While it is funny to watch Coulter treat it as a simulation, it doesn't make any sense for him not to know about the terrorist bombings.    Second, though the relationship progressed nicely between Coulter and Christina, there were a few cheesy moments.  It seems hard to do good scenes with romantic tension in a sci-fi movie.    Still, this is an excellent movie, and easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.  If you enjoy a good sci-fi or thriller, this should be an enjoyable movie.    This is Duncan Jones' 2nd film, his first being Moon, one of the best Science Fiction movies in recent years.  I deeply hope Jones continues to direct smart, engaging sci fi movies.  We need something to balance out Transformers.      4/5 stars
B004J4WQ46|4.0|This is the record their third should have been. This record is very solid and the only track that doesn't really work is Metabolism. Every track may be different, but so was First Impressions of Earth. The difference is that the songs on this album actually keep your attention and the whole album is better than First Impressions of Earth, which still fails to keep my attention past track 3. Angles: not as good as Room on Fire and Is This It, but it's still a damn great record.
B004GYY714|5.0|Easy to use. Works beautifully. Love it and highly recommend. Would be perfection if it had a widget, but I am very pleased with it even without a widget.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book just pulls you through it.  It's the typical boy (you) vs. world.  You can really picture yourself as Ender, or more aptly put, how you with you were.      Since reading this book, I've read the next two books right after.  The next two books are very different, yet still great.      Card is a great writer, and does a great job of putting the reader in the driver's seat.  You can picture yourself as Ender, savior of the world.
0756404738|5.0|I'm just about at the end and don't want it to.  It was worth the wait for sure but there have been some surprising twists in the story I wonder if it can end in the few chapters remaining.  If it doesn't I don't know if I'll be happy for the conclusion of a great story by a wonderful story teller, both Kvothe and Rothfuss, or sad that I may have to wait another long stretch for the next book.  I've seen no clues anywhere about how many books are in this series. 10 Sounds like a good number, but Kvothe would be hoarse, Bast would be old, and the Chronicler would have artheritic fingers.
B0013ND30M|3.0|Out of all the Disney classics, Sleeping Beauty isn't his best work to me. It has never completely grabbed me, and I realized why I didn't want to watch it all the time when I last saw it.   To be completely honest I have never really liked the songs, and the choir. Personal choice, but that style of choir voice has never appealed to me.  However, in saying that, there are some absolutely hilarious scenes, from the fairies arguing over the dress, right till the very end, to Prince Phillip landing in the mud, to my personal favourite is the drunk Jester in court with the two kings. It is still a classic that I will treasure for all time, even if I don't watch it every week, I will certainly value it and watch it at least every six months.    3 out of 5
B002ZG981E|5.0|i love this movie, you constantly think about it after watching it for the 1st time. recommend everyone to enjoy this masterpiece.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Like it or not Facebook and other online social medias are here for some time. Like it or not these platforms have changed the way people go about business, and daily life. If you are not a fan - you are unique and can see what draws to greater majority to these virtual technologies. You needn't agree - but may be able to catch a glimpse of what attracts others and I commend you as a non-fan as your restraint is admirable. If a fan of facebook, it will be interesting for you, I think, to learn more of some of the supposed story as to how the site had developed and evolved. It is a movie, I understand this - but gather research was done quite well.<br /><br />I think its a 21st century must see, for the status quo. It won't change your life (the movie) but Facebook will/can.
B004GYY714|5.0|Flawless on my EVO! Picked up local stations easily. No problems, whatsoever! Many stations streaming.... May say goodbye to XM! Literally, two clicks, and playing music...
0316098337|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. A beautifully written book, heart breaking and joyous at the same time. I could hardly put it down and when I did I could not stop thinking about it. Even now, days after finishing it, it's still lingering in my thoughts. Jack's 'voice' as the narrator took a few pages to get used to but it did not alter my love of this book one bit. I will read again... and probably again...
B00003CXB4|5.0|the lionking pretty much sells itself as one of the greatest animated films of all time. adventures are fun, the characters are amazing, the landscapes are beautiful, and Mufasa's untimely passing was truly heartfelt. I cried, laughed, smiled, and had the time of my life watching the lion king!!!
B002ZG974M|4.0|Great movie not just for parents, but for people interested in human development. I just wish there was a bit more commentary - some interesting facts, figures, and stories to support the \\"awhhh\\" and \\"wow\\" moments while watching this. Perhaps a directors cut, with commentary, would be interesting.<br /><br />I love the rating, and agree with it 100%, but being in the Middle East (as a teacher from Canada) would caution folks buying this for the more sensitive cultures of the world. Simply put, the breast feeding scenes and milking scenes will not go over well with the more closed cultures of the 21st Century.<br /><br />Brilliant Concept here
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I'll admit I popped Inglourious Basterds in the player expecting a completely different movie, a mind-numbing violent and bloody movie.  That didn't happen so I kept asking myself \\"what is going on here?\\"  I was too curious to stop watching because the acting was incredible, purposefully exaggerated, and at times absolutely hysterical (Brad Pitt).  About 2/3's of the way through the movie it hit me what was going on; the movie is about headgames!      I immediately started the movie over and watched it from the headgame perspective.  Inglourious Basterds is BRILLIANT in every scene from start to finish demonstrating both how to play headgames on others and how one's own headgames messes with your own behavior.  The script, pace, timing, and total commitment of every character to the headgames they are going to inflict or endure is masterful. The movie plays like a mental chess game where the characters disarm, position, or manipulate their opponents, establish their offense, then attack when the time is right.  Every chapter demonstrates something new to add to the story.      If you have to deal with headgames in your life at any level, watch Inglourious Basterds with your brain turned into the headgame frequency.  You will be entertained and educated.
0385512058|5.0|This book is a terrific road map to create strong new relationships! A how to book for doing more business!
1934429376|5.0|I love this book!! It is now one of my favorite reference books and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing the work of a fantastic illustrator who influenced so many people today. I work quite a bit in Adobe Illustrator and Mr. Harper's style is well suited for vector graphics. He could capture his subjects true essence and distill it into wonderful drawings that are so modern even today. Buy this book! You won't regret it!!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I think this movie is a great view, a must for movie goers in the 21st century due to its fame and following. People love it, but also, there are a select number that have gone the other way. To be fair - this makes the movie great as there are different camps. I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />There are many lengthy reviews here detailing the ins and outs. If you are reading this review - I simply recommend this. Even if you are let down (don't think you will be) you will be able to discuss this with many, and will be able to back your views.<br /><br />In time, this will become a classic. Get familiar with it.
B003XU7VM4|4.0|Reads like an episode of the TV show Castle only with the names changed and a bit more sex than network TV will allow.    The author's bio is, of course, Castle himself which is a bit tricky considering he's fictitious.  I can only assume that the \\"sherpas\\" referred to in the introduction are the actual ghost writers for the book.    I won't spoil plot points, but, if you like the way the characters and dialog works on TV, you'll like this go-along novel.    Now, on to read the second one...
B00005JNNZ|5.0|This is a very good movie. Everyone in our household likes this movie. Samuel L. Jackson did this movie justice when he played the lead part. I would recommend.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|Wow, I typically love movies based on Jane Austen books, but this was a *snoozer*! It moved so slowly, yet had *so* many characters, it was hard to figure out who was who till the movie was just about over. I asked my mother older mother to watch it with me, and she could barely sit through it. This on top of the fact that it was hard to believe that the great-looking and vivacious male love interest was \\"all time\\" in love with the mousie-looking and very uninteresting and quiet female primary character - I was so unimpressed with the movie that I cannot even remember their characters' names.    Luckily I rented it from NetFlix before wasting my money on a DVD. If I hadn't, that DVD would've sat in it's box for the rest of my life. I love all versions of P&P, and Emma, and S&S, I even enjoyed the little play-on-P&P mini-series \\"Lost in Austen\\", but, this movie?... was not good.    I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the acting, costuming and locations were nice.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I love Clapton on anything. This DVD has super-high video (near Blue Ray) and sound quality. Great to see the original band playing in 2005. Highly recommend to all Cream/Clapton fans.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This movie is funny enough to watch over and over and over. Personally, its one of my favorite movies. Great characters and hilarious scenes is why it has become, what people call, a cult classic.
B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|What happened?  If I could get my money back I would.  One of the Boys was a fun pop album but this one is a complete mess!  There are maybe two songs I can stand to listen to but the rest if full of terrible lyrics and does nothing for Katy's voice.   Really terrible.  End of story.
B002X9GX4S|5.0|I never liked screamo, so the first time I listened to this album I wasn't impressed. It wasn't till I heard Shawn Milke singing 'I handed you a knife and my heart, and now the dream is over' at the end of Annabel that made me realize the true beauty in what I was hearing. After falling desperately in love with the song Annabel, I began noticing how melodic all of the songs are on this album. Not only are the storyline and lyrics brilliant, the sound is heart-warming and heart-breaking and beautiful. I would definitely suggest this album to anyone who appreciates music. I credit Alesana for opening me up to a different genre of music. Keep listening and you will discover something truly special.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie is a first class production with all the right elements - excellent animation, good writing, quality actors doing the voices, an interesting storyline, etc. My kids enjoyed it and I would recommend it.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|I enjoyed laughing, there are moments you see yourself. He did things I do like rolling up your car window wanting nothing to do with the guy who looked like he just came over the Boarder with a sack of Oranges.
0307474712|2.0|I don't know about the rest of you, but books and I... we have a love/hate relationship.  Just when I think I've finally hit that \\"plateau\\" that illusive level where the books stop sucking and I can ride a wave of beautifully penned literature, I get hit with a novel that makes me want to chunk it into a sink hole.<br /><br />When I first let on that I was reading \\"One Day\\" by David Nicholls I got hit with a rash of the most entertaining tweets or emails I've ever seen. \\"One Day... as in the book written by the devil?\\" \\"Oh God, save yourself.. read the operator manual to your refrigerator instead.\\" Now, for any sane human these statements would lead to a mass exodus to the right, but for me, the girl that more often that not disagrees with popular opinion, it was like hanging a 10 pound bag of gummy bears in front of my face and then refusing to let me eat them.  I was GOING to read this freaking book, and I was hell bent on telling every last one of y'all just exactly what you were missing.<br /><br />Dear everyone, I would like to apologize for not trusting you.<br /><br />Emma and Dexter are complete opposites. Emma is a middle class, over-educated,  prude while Dexter is a handsome, rich and extremely self-absorbed playboy, but...to both of their surprises one fateful night after their college graduation has now bonded them for life. Friends at the best of times and enemies for the rest, both realize their lives are easier with each other than without, but living very different lives leaves a toll and a string of mishaps both feel reluctant to shove under the rug. Will Emma ever tell Dexter how she feels? Will Dexter's drinking lead him to an early grave, and will either of them ever realize that expectations are worse than cancer?<br /><br />I finished this book almost 2 weeks ago, and have since written 3 reviews for it.  The first was less than diplomatic, throwing out phrases like \\"WTF\\" and \\"I want to push Nicholls off of a cliff.\\" The 2nd was a little better only threatening the life of Emma and Dexter, and the 3rd...well... it was probably the worst seeing as how I wrote a 10 page rant about using British slang in nationally published (and recognized) novels. So please believe me when I say this 4th review comes with great reservations and a very tight grip on my general irritation towards this novel.  That said, let me start with the good (cause it's the shorter list) the overall concept of this novel was great. Take two characters, let them lead their lives, and then check back in on them every year on the same date. Great right? Sure... until you add in the fact that this goes on for 20 years.  That's right... we are subjected to the mundane trials of Emma and Dexter's lives for 20, mind numbing, completely obnoxious, whiny years. But wait kids... that's not that bad part. The bad part, the part that gets under your skin and makes you want to scream is the fact that the CLIMAX of the book happens around chapter 15. A climax that basically ends the books, so imagine my surprise when I had to keep reading... and reading....and reading.  Now, at this point I could keep rambling; tell you that the characters were less than impressive,  (whiny and boring) and that the language was frustrating (British slang mashed with half formed sentences) but what would be the point.  If you still want to read it after my obvious loathing then there is really nothing else I could say.<br /><br />My overall take. Save your money, and hope to high heaven the movie version is better.<br /><br />Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: sometime diplomacy is over-rated.mma and Dexter, and the 3rd...well... it was probably the worst seeing as how I wrote a 10 page rant about using British slang in nationally published (and recognized) novels.

Now, at this point I could keep rambling; tell you that the characters were less than impressive,  (whiny and boring) and that the language was frustrating (British slang mashed with half formed sentences) but what would be the point.  If you still want to read it after my obvious loathing then there is really nothing else I could say.    My overall take. Save your money, and hope to high heaven the movie version is better.    Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: sometime diplomacy is over-rated.
1400079144|5.0|The Lost Symbol was a good read. I had my interest piqued in this book not only by my friends, but also my family. This is a book for anybody who loves to read suspense novels. My grandmother even recommended this author, and even more this book. I have read other novels by Dan Brown, so this was easily a shoe-in.   If you have read any of Dan Brown's other books you understand why it is such a page turner. Brown captures the reader's interest with this small chapters and suspenseful plot. This book will have you saying, \\"just one more chapter.\\" Then once you finish that chapter, you will say, \\"okay, maybe just one more.\\"    The plot follows the same similar story as his other books which is that of a suspenseful and mysterious plot.  Robert Langdon is the main character, and he is a \\"Symbologist\\" and a professor at Harvard. He is called on as the official know-everything about symbology. In this story he uses his knowledge of the free masons to solve an intense and very unique mystery. In other books the mystery ranges from an ancient brotherhood called the Illuminati to the ever famous Da Vinci Code in which he goes through and decodes ancient art to help him solve the mystery.   Overall, if you enjoy suspense and mystery this book is a must read.  I would recommend not only The Lost Symbol but also any of Brown's other books.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Dear Ms. Picoult,    As an aging \\"vanessa-esque\\" lesbian, it's quite a treat to read a novel by an acclaimed author where, at long last, \\"the girl gets the girl.\\"    Posh. You rock.    A big thanks,  Lisa    PS Sequel? Series?
B001E45XT4|4.0|These are solid, good sounding headphones, and the mic folds up and out of the way when you are not using it.<br /><br />The ear cups are comfortable, but the material might wear after a while.<br />While it is hard to wind the cord around some phones, you won't have that problem with these.<br />The full-cup design blocks outside noise really well
B001NESPHC|2.0|Nelson Riddle-like arrangements mostly heard in the 1950's.  A sweet, but limited, vocalist. I guess this is the age of American Idol and mediocrity is King, but I really don't understand what the fuss is about this singer. I found the music to be banal.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Just strapped this onto my bike and took my 30 inch tall 20 lb 11 month old boy for a ride on my Giant Rincon and he loved it.  He was laughing at people walking their dogs and didn't have any problems with the harness.    One small problem, having this in front of my seat makes it so that I cannot lower my body in front of the seat to put my feet down on both sides of the bicycle.  This makes  stopping something that I have to pay attention to, but it's not a big problem.  I lowered my seat down to make mounting dismounting easier.    If you're a spandex clad endurance biker this might not be for you, but for a casual biker who wants to get their kid outside this is great, and it's nice having them in front of you, his head kinda balances between my upper arms as I pedal.    Wasn't all that hard to install.  Took me a little bit as I'm not very mechanical.    I've never used a trailer and I wouldn't care to really, but I think this is probably better than a similar item that sits BEHIND the seatpost (like I remember my parents using with me) because the kid can see better and you can keep an eye on him, especially for very small children.    What a fun Saturday for us both!
160059672X|3.0|The photos and projects are amazing inspiration. Her work is breathtaking. But the instructions were exactly the same for almost every project. Glue cab, back stitch around it and use your imagination from there.  I hoped for a bit more detail on everything. To me, the book mostly offered inspiration and beautiful pictures.  I could have gotten that from her website.
B001FB5634|1.0|This movie was a total waste of my money. It was very hard to watch, as it was very dark almost the entire movie.It was very hard to follow. Many parts of the movie didn't make any sense. It is foolish to even think that it would cause any ongoing or lasting results from watching it. Don't waste your money, even with Bluray!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Nice sharpener for the money. It sharpens the the serrated areas of the knife like a champ. Buy with confidence.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|The newest version does not allow you to search for an item by taking a picture - only by bar code. Most of the time that's fine, but sometimes there isn't a bar code available. Also, the earlier versions would buzz the phone when an item that you were searching for was found. This was a really useful feature because you could go on browsing through other items while Amazon was searching and bringing up the product page. How do I get back to the older version?
0670022411|3.0|I haven't read one in such a long time it was kinda of fun, but Gawd, so predictable. Head strong smart/stupid beautiful witch who supresses her natural abilities to fit in, falls for an impossibly gorgeous, romantic, protective, arrogent, understanding, sexually active, Semper Fi vampire. He's French, need I say more. What in the hell has happened to vampires anyway? They keep evolving. Where are the good old fashioned Nosferatus? The evil, scare the pants off of you blood sucking undead monsters who reak of death? These new fellows will be having manicures, going to the dentist, having coffee at Starbucks then driving to the beach to wind surf and get a tan.
B002ZE85YW|5.0|The director's cut is better than the original but did not have as much added back as I would have liked and I personally think the special features would have fitted on the movie disk. This movie could have been better if it had more scenes added back in or at the least more special features.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Excellent show. Some good historical facts too, but best is King Henry and his love of women described. He loves with great GREAT passion and hate the same way.<br />Interested in some history and great love affairs. This one is for you.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|The latest version of this application has far too many permissions. With no explanation. Exactly why does it need to read system log files? I would like to completely uninstall, but I can't. At least I can avoid the &quot;upgrade.&quot;
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm really not into \\"post-apocalyptic\\" fiction. I's hard to get me into author's new version of the world. But in this case, you keep following the characters, so human, tragic, fun, loyal and doubtful, that I fell without noticing into the arena with Katniss and Peeta. Is one of those books you just cant put down once started.<br /><br />Katniss is not my favorite character, is Peeta. Knowing him through the eyes of Katniss along the fear, the unknown world of the capitol, the Hunger Games Marketing!, the cross-romance strategy; you can't do anything but love his kindness, devotion and love - even if Katniss only identify them as part of the game.<br /><br />They are another characters that balance the cruelty of the Capitol. Katniss prep team adds a hilarious touch. Haymitch become a real mentor and friend.<br /><br />The end really makes you crave for more and more. I'm gonna devour the complete trilogy.
B00466HN68|3.0|***SPOILER ALERT!***<br /><br />Good movie, plot clicks along, lots of action--as one reviewer pointed out, a nightmare Groundhog's Day with lots of special effects. Captain Colter Stevens(Jake Gyllenhaal) is a USAF pilot whose unit was decimated in a catastrophic attack in Afghanistan. Colter regains consciousness and finds himself enmeshed in what he thinks is a training exercise. He's forced to relive an eight-minute loop where his mind/personality inhabits a passenger (an unassuming suburban schoolteacher)on a Chicago communter train that gets blown up. His job is to figure out which passenger planted the bomb so that a worse attack can be averted. Each time Captain Stevens \\"returns\\" to the train, he gets a little closer to identifying the bomber, and a little closer to realizing he's in love with a fellow passenger. At that point, he decides to change the mission: instead of just giving his handlers information about an event that already took place and cost hundreds of lives, he wants to re-shape the past so that the killer is caught before the train ever blows up.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal does a good job: he goes from befuddlement at finding himself on a train that then explodes to, on subsequent trips back, having a laser-focused plan to disarm the bomb and nail his guy within the allotted time frame. He also developes the character of the pilot who frantically tries to piece together his personal reality--going from a war zone to a \\"test pod\\"--while the people giving him orders evade his questions.<br /><br />But of course, Hollywood never misses the opportunity to miss an opportunity. Predictably, the first person Capt. Stevens suspects as the bomber is a South Asian-looking (ie., Muslim) guy who seems nervous and edgy, and who exits the train at an unusual stop. Every single person in the audience knew that this was the lesson: Stevens assumed the guy was a terrorist because he profiled him, but the profile was WRONG.<br /><br />(I don't think it's a plot-spoiler to say that the actual bomber is a banal yet psychotic American unconnected to any hate group.)<br /><br />This was dissonent and not a little manipulative. The chief scientist for the \\"source code project\\" that sends Stevens on his missions makes specific references to the War on Terror. We know that the War on Terror involves organized global groups with agenda to activate operatives who will carry out attacks to achieve their goals--9/11, Bali, London, etc. Yet we're expected to believe, according to Source Code, that the real war on terror is focused on random mass murderers who are anomolies like Tim McVeigh lone wolves leading unremarkable lives.That's because Hollywood has agreed that the only reference to Muslims, in this post-9/11 world, have to depict them as innocent, and often framed, victims of suspicion. That's just as unrealistic and unfair as viewing all Muslims as terrorists.<br /><br />This movie would have gone from \\"pretty good\\" to \\"great\\" if the writer had made two significant changes: 1) if Gyllanhaal, on his first mission, looks in the mirror and sees not a Joe Average non-Muslim history teacher but rather a young imam, and 2)if the terrorist was indeed an al-Qaeda jihadist on assignment.<br /><br />The movie would had sacrficed none of its suspense and character development,but the audience would have seen--in Gyllanhaal, who did indeed play the Prince of Persia--a Muslim who FIGHTS terrorism, underscoring the fact that Muslims and terrorists are not mutually inclusive groups. It would have shown that Muslims can risk their lives to defend the US and its values, and it would have given Muslims another narrative to embrace: neither terrorist nor victim, but patriot who is willing to recognize jihadist groups and take them down.<br /><br />It's too bad the writing/production team chickened out on this element. \\"Source Code\\" remains a decent movie, but not one that has the earmarks of a classic.<br /><br />If Gyllanhaal had been the anti-jihadi, though, this movie would have been explosive...on many levels.els.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical about this show before I started watching it. I assumed it was going to be some horrible horror show with no plot line. Man, was I wrong. This is now one of my favorite shows! I was so hooked after picking this up at Wal-Mart on Black Friday that as soon as I finished Season one I had to go out and buy Seasons 2 and 3! Then after finishing those I immediately bought seasons 4 and 5. This series is just that good where you'll be hooked until you're caught up. In fact, I'm currently caught up to where it's at on Season 6, and I almost wish I wouldn't have watched them so fast, because it's hard to wait for a new episode! This series has a perfect balance of horror, drama, suspense, comedy and action to keep you wanting more. I would go into specifics but I don't want to write any spoilers so as to ruin it. Hopefully this review was somewhat helpful. Thanks for reading and go buy Season 1 of Supernatural NOW!!!!!!!!!!
0861714911|5.0|\\"In the Buddha's Words\\", an anthology from the Nikayas, is wonderfully clear, systemic, and put together well. This book, in part, convinced me that these teachings can be verified. I had been a pretty big atheist before reading this, and I had been searching for a good philosophy that could represent me. You see, humanism is not a complete or systemic philosophical world-view, and attempts at such just seem to fail. I found Buddhism to be the end result of the humanist's endeavor, in part thanks to this book.    Now before an atheist reading this review gets annoyed, my becoming Buddhist was probably not the intent of the editor, Bhikkhu Bodhi. The western world has more of a new age view of Buddhism, an unfortunate thing, and this monk has done a wonderful job at exposing it to our culture.     My only complaint would be that it could be coupled with some graduated meditation training. I am currently working through \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" for learning Vipassana(Insight) Meditation, and purchased \\"Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English\\", which I believe covers Samatha(Calm Abiding) Meditation. There is another book on the four sumpreme abodes called \\"Loving-Kindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness\\", which aims to train Loving-Kindness, Compassion, Altruistic Joy, and Equanimity in us. I think these four books are all a westerner needs for the basics. Of course, feel free to read any book around, if the joy of learning is abound. You will find these four keyed more towards those interested in Theravada Buddhism, although most all Buddhists can find appreciation in these.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I truly loved this novel by Deborah harkness. The way the author interweaves witches, vampires, daemons, history, a love story, drama and intrigue is truly amazing and will keep the reader wanting to know what happens next. I could not put this novel down and was forced to read it at every waking moment including long stoplights! I truly hope there will soon be a book two as I HAVE to know what happens next!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|THIS is a crucial cornerstone, the story that will determine much of the fate of all young Americans and future generations. It is a great and true story that explains how a deregulated Wall St manifested into the economic and literal destruction of America.  Unfortunately, many people on main st USA would agree, this has contributed to turning America into a 3rd world country.  Hopefully he makes another documentary that elaborates on the most widespread and evil and perverted financial institution ever created in human history; The Federal Reserve.  F__K the Fed, Sue the Fed, Audit the Fed, and END THE FED!
B000YABYLA|4.0|It was weird to watch this with my daughter, who is just about the age of the girl in this film.  What is so wonderful about the film is that it truly gets to the essence of how a child would experience a pregnancy that was a mistake.  On the verge of getting an abortion, she decides to have the child and finds a local family for it.  Then she goes on with her life, muddling through like so many high school students.  It is believable, moving, funny, disturbing, and uplifting, a wonderful stimulus to dialogue between generations.  The ending is a little la-di-dah with newfound love, there are perhaps not enough emotional consequences - but that might be the point, when she and her boyfriend do not even want to see the baby - but it is genuinely beautiful in its own way.  The acting is absolutely superb, with all the pain and confusion of adolescents dealing (or not) with adult issues.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Love this movie! It has much more depth than I expected. Its emotional and dark yet beautiful and fun.  The charactors have a lot of depth and the subject matter is treated with honesty.
