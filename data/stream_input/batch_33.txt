B00CG0IXCE|2|Feels kind of flimsy,scratch,s really easy and it took along time to ship I would not recommend product or shipper do not buy
B00CU7I5AS|3|Look great!!! Great design!!! Fit very well!!! Only inconvenient so far is that it's foggy after a while !!!!
B00C1LS0YY|2|Bought these in Jan 2014.  Love them but they are a maintence item and require replacement.  I've replaced one motor 9 months ago and screws fell out of the valve of the other around the same time so it rattles a bit.  Now the other motor has failed so it's time to buy again.<br /><br />The car they are on is a daily and I open and close the cutouts at least 3 times a day.  So they have about a thousand cycle lifespan.
B001KSE4SA|5|Fast shipping. Works great.
B003STZ6EK|4|Looks nice, a little thinner than I expected.
B004XRGGG8|5|Great
B000CB6A24|5|They are the only blades that I order for my Jeep
B002R8BT1C|5|AS EXPECTED
B00RILMSD6|5|Great fit. Arrived early
B00X4UG88Q|5|Love it! Sparkly and  looks great on my new red VW Jetta.
B001KSEJBW|5|Great filter, great price, great service, fast shipping!!! I recommend any one who needs their cabin air filter changed pick this up and DYI. The procedure is extremely easy (on most modern cars), usually a couple of plastic tabs or pegs on the side of/behind the glove-box. The filter came with a printout of instructions how to access, remove, and replace for my vehicle. Install took less than 5 minutes, no tools. A+++ product!
B0002MBKD2|5|Love it!!
B00BFU9HWG|5|I installed the stable loads before I went on a 4000 mile road trip. They literally saved us in the strong winds (20-30mph) we faced on the road.
B00K53CLKE|4|Item works as described.
B0076YE4QO|4|Great product for the price. The rubber feet came off right away so I glues them back on. These are easy to install and easy to use.
B004O47U9M|5|Strong.  Well made.  Easy installation.  Quick, no-tool removal when not wanted.  I have one on my '91 Honda Nighthawk 750 and it's solid as a rock @ speeds well over 100 mph.  Have already done 500 mile days w/almost no wind fatigue.  I'm 6' tall.  Another 2 in. of height and Plexifairing would be absolutely PERFECT for me/my Nighthawk..  I highly recommend it - especially for riders 5'10&#34; and under.
B00FNUQAGU|5|Great for systems without a high output alternator. I didn't have the money for the alternator at the time and this was perfect for system downtime when I wasn't using the amplifier.
B00AU5NAC0|5|Great product, price and shipping!
B00AYI1J7G|4|A little hard to put on but it's really nice & soft. Definitely a dark gray color, not like the lighter gray in the picture.
B00CMJC2H6|5|Worked perfectly for our needs!
B00KWJ5VRG|5|Thumbs up
B00FGWUNC2|5|Gotta love OEM fits perfectly and installed less than 30 minutes.
B00HVI7426|4|I love the it fits perfectly on the key but I hate that the material that it's made from gets dirty so fast. Other than its a perfect way to protect your key.
B00FSDFKAO|5|Looks just like original!
B00IN5X2P4|5|fits the car perfectly.  Stays up when i have to tilt my seats.  no complaints
B007NVSWCM|4|Purchased this to protect my shoulder/collarbone muscles during roller derby after separating my shoulder. The brace is comfortable and the semi-hard plastic shell was able to prevent, for the most part, my shoulder from being pushed across the front of my chest- (which is what I needed).
B00B8YA66A|5|Extremely easy to install once you figure it out. Obviously you're going to do one side at a time. Locate the pins and pop them out and these should come out with relative ease. After installing just one side, my tailgate was able to open to the max. After installing both my tailgate would open without me applying any pressure to open it. I've had them in for some time now and although they have lost some strength, they still work perfectly. Would definitely buy again.
B0015PKMLQ|5|Great
B00RGZWIW0|5|I will be ordering two more for my mazda 3.
B001LA34VA|5|Made of a good vinyl and looks real great....
B00842A7F4|5|Perfect!
B00496LM4E|5|Great
B00BTLEJXI|5|Perfect for a &#34;NEW&#34; look in an old car !! Very sporty the guys loved them !!!
B00E7WEFQ2|1|It didnt come with anything to stick it to the car qith . The package said it had 3m tape , but it only came with eyelashes . I wouldnt waste my money on this ...
B00IZF2JGK|1|They look look good but they suck to install
B000W0RQ8C|3|locks great and sleek! Its a bit difficult to close when on the hitch!
B000C16XL2|5|This really worked out well. I looked at a couple of YouTube videos and had it installed within an hour. Given that I had never dug into the window before, I think I could do it in half the time now that I know the process. I did have to take a single bumper off of the old bracket to fill a hole on the new bracket, but it was simple; just don't forget to look for it.<br /><br />It was a direct replacement and I couldn't be happier with the final result.
B00OVKDS6I|5|Its the only one that had hangers for lights.great value.
B00NG96MUY|5|So cool!
B007ACZAQA|5|LOVE THIS
B00U7BMFQY|5|Great product
B000BZI8XU|5|Replacement 100% original, highly recommend
B00GRY2ZSS|5|fit my 2001 f-150 supercrew perfectly
B0057UJY7I|5|Used in 2011 WRX Limited, seems to shift smoother than factory Subaru full synthetic gear oil.
B0038DAZM4|5|Perfect for mixing epoxy
B006ZSUR5O|5|Super easy to install!!
B0002MABGE|1|I have to agree with others.  Any smart, determined medium-sized dog can foil this thing in short order.  I have tried everything, including modifying the bars with cotter pins to keep them from sliding.  Both of our dogs have figured out how to defeat the system by bending the bars which are not strong enough to do the job they are supposed to do.  We end up with both dogs in the back seat or worse any time we are away from the vehicle, and often both in the back seat while we are traveling.  Yes they are smart dogs, but even a dumb dog could pound this baby into submission.
B004UMI58I|3|Worked as advertised
B000C57V3M|2|Draglink itself is a great product.  It came missing the mounting hardware for one side.  Only received the install package for one side.
B002THX2TS|2|Product started to tear after using it for about two weeks. To return the product they charge you shipping that is almost equal to the price you paid for the item. I would not recommend buying this product, very disappointed.
B00E5VXI5E|5|Great looking lights.Quality parts.Makes my bike stand out from the crowd as it matches semi gloss finish of other blacked out trim. 10 watt bulbs are plenty bright for turn signals.
B006D9W95G|5|Awesome kit but recommend buying the front trackbar from Teraflex as well.
B000I04Z7Q|1|Very dem, the blue does not work
B00G66DP3G|1|they don't state that they are sale only one unit instade of pair so there price for pair its more expencive thane others
B00PBIEJ6M|1|DID NOT WORK AS DESCRIBED. THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK!!!!!!!!
B000C8PA50|5|Seemed to fit just like the factory filter in my 2006 Honda Pilot.
B00QQ7UQSC|5|All metal tool works great for ac valves.
B0000AY60S|5|Very easy to apply and remove, lasts a long time.
B00RH3AMIS|5|Quality tie downs.....quick delivery.
B00WZA067A|4|Seems to be good levers!! Not put on yet but, I think they'll do good.. ;)
B011JA8BVE|5|good
B00ZOKJVAG|5|I love how they just stick to the window and easy to remove
B0089ZL7S2|4|It fits my magnum x1 victory had to use the adaptors off the original stock mirrors for them to work . The mirrors are the same size as the stock mirrors.
B00M6QTO6C|2|Cover is made well and fits my ATV perfectly. Unfortunately the desert digital pattern cover faded in a couple of weeks in the sun and is now a pink color on top.
B00MUHZQJ6|5|clean lines love it
B000C9GK9O|4|Fit perfectly cleared error code once installed
B00S195ERQ|5|will purchase thru this buyer again, very happy
B000E2CVI8|4|fits
B0002MG5M8|5|Works great. Not only is my food cold but it was wonderful to have Popsicles for the family on a hot summer day.
B000EDMX8K|5|Great
B0055AW0N0|5|Works great.
B000CPI5XC|5|Excellent !, ... My Nissan truck really seems to appreciate Redline products.
B00B51X3NE|5|The previous owner of my charger took off the SRT8 spoiler that came with it (white), so I decided to buy one and reinstall it because I wanted the sportier look, and I do not regret it.<br />I decided to go with the Matte Black to compliment my all white charger, and I couldn't of picked something better in color. The instructions are vague, but the hardware worked perfectly and installed it myself (had to drill through the trunk). But I think it was well worth it, especially for the price, I was skeptical at first because of it, but I was wrong. Adds a great look on a budget, with the dual chrome cat-back exhaust it looks really nice. Came shipped with care, and on time. The only thing is that it made the low visibility in the rear view window of the charger even worse, it went from bad to terrible visibility (sits almost dead center in the rear window). And the spoiler gets REALLY hot in a short period of time in the sunlight, yes it is black but to the point where I can't touch it nor can anyone else, don't know if that will hurt the quality in the long-run, but for now it's great.
B001C4OB44|3|Felt the difference with my axcord, but with my MDX I don't feel a thing and gas still the same. I am happy that I just have to maintaine the filter and not change it.
B001NYYREC|5|Excellent fits perfectly easy to install.
B00XKJW7KY|5|It took only few minutes to replace the old damaged mirror on my car. Quality is the same as the original and the price is very good. Also I tried heating and it also works. Just be careful which one you need, left one or the right one!
B00MJV6NNG|2|As an assembly, it does not work as sold.  It looks pretty good installed (why 2 stars), but the bulbs in this fixture gets blister-hot after a short period of time literally leaving a burn blister.  The surrounding wood in the RV was very hot too.  I can't imagine what would have happened if left on for hours.  Ok, I had to cut my existing hole in my RV slide to accommodate the fixture so it was pretty much there to stay.  I fixed the situation by replacing bulbs with LED lights.
B00KTJ5H3M|1|The buttons are too soft and shell does not assemble easy.
B004I0N99C|1|This lamp assembly would not fit my 2004 Chevy Blazer as received out of the box.  It looked identical to the old one, but after an hour of turning and pushing it into place, it just would not go into position.  Eventually I got a flash light and saw that one of the plastic alignment pins on this 3rd party replacement assembly would not slide into the alignment hole on the sheet metal support of my Blazer.  I shaved a bit of plastic off the alignment pin with a Dremel Tool and the assembly slipped right in on the first try!
B005F33270|1|There is a reason why over 25% of the stars are 1 star and that this is a discontinued product.  This went on a trailer that is lived in, so it requires 24/7 service.  Right from the beginning, it did not provide the correct pressure...it was low, very noticeable on the burners on the stove.  After 3 months of constant usage, it stopped automatically switching and about a month after that, it failed completely as it would not allow any propane to get thru it, regardless of the where the switch was.<br /><br />Don't be like me and ignore the bad reviews and waste your money on this item.
B0031BPY4C|5|Very nice. Took a minor mod to fit my bike but they look so much better than the stock ones.
B0045JYUY4|4|These were easy to install.  Just be sure that, when removing the end caps from your rails, that you stand directly behind the vehicle, not to the side.<br /><br />They look great and are super robust.  My only complaint is that the exposed screws mean that someone could fairly easily steal your rack equipment.  An optional lock bolt would go a long way.
B00CZEZNGU|5|Very easy to install. You just have to remember that RV wiring is different...  i.e. The black wire is hot (not ground).  Very bright white light.<br />I wanted two more of the LEDs to put in another dome light in my trailer, but realized it was cheaper to buy the whole fixture than it was to buy two LEDs this bright, so I'll get getting another soon.
B00MFQVMZY|5|works great although fits weird but does the job
B002Q1INDM|5|Bought my ARB in Sept. 2011 (4 years ago) as a backup 12v refrigerator for a cruising boat in the Sea of Cortez. It lived on deck in the sun but performed flawlessly. Used it as a freezer at times and cooled to its minimum setting of -18 C without a problem - even in direct sun and 35C (95F) temperatures. Relegated to storage in 2013 with a few road trips once in a while. Now back in daily use as a freezer at -18C with no problems. Freezes 2.5 gallons of water in less time than my commercial freezer. The appearance inside and out  is still great. No apparent deterioration after 4 years.<br />The ARB has been a great buy for me.
B00VKX76OY|5|Excellent.
B0036VQUOA|1|I went on Youtube to see how this work and try it on my Lexus it actually make it worst then before, you will get some fine light scratches from the sanding pad and they don't come off, terrible mistake!
B001A6ZD1Y|5|Wife loves it just right not to dark so she can ride at night.
B0006SU3QW|4|Good stuff. Beats buying new wheels
B00ZI7SQR4|5|Works and fits great
B00VPIE3ZY|5|Fantastic
B005FLRBDS|5|Easy to install. Fit perfect
B0002KM5M4|5|Makes bleeding brake system so much easier and a one man operation.
B0049EHJAW|5|magnific!!! just install and foreget it
B00BITJUGW|5|Delivered on time and very good quality 😊
B00GUCJUS0|5|Exactly what we needed to replace the broken one we had; half the price from dealership or other high-end vendors. Thanks!
B00AC6XRDE|5|They are huge! I had to stop my girlfriend from packing so much stuff because we only went out for a week trip and she felt like she had unlimited room. (Maybe that's a reason not to get it?) But no really, she didn't even have to pack into my side. I only had these and the straps on top were perfect for strapping down extra sling bags on one side and riding jackets on the other.<br /><br />Very durable, but not slim at all. It's the widest part of my FZ6. I have a Corbin Seat and I run the straps underneath the seat. They work great like that. I have no doubts that the original seat would also let these bags underneath the seat.
B00IGU9S8Q|5|great.
B000C6UJVC|5|Product are exceptional, would recommend someone to buy.
B00CEJCJNG|5|Worked great, fit my grandsons John Deere Gator perfectly.
B00D2PLR0C|3|After being given a Pod X1 for Christmas I decided I would try the larger product for its added capabilities. The X1 has a metal exoskeleton which enstills quality when holding and using it. The X4 is made out of plastic and generally felt like there was much less R&D put into it than for the X1. I returned it for that reason.
B004RCR7OY|3|They really need to make the outer frame more of a one-peace so the top does not separate from the bottom if walked on.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Saved our bacon on a camping trip we took some Okinawan students on.  Thanks to this roof-top bag we didn't have to drive 5 hours with all of our camping gear spread out on people's laps.  We don't have a factory roof rack so I used our ski-rack for cross beams and then cut out some side bars using scrap cherry wood I had laying around.  The sidebars might not have been necessary but I figured it would help with stability and safety.  Holds tons of stuff, we had two tents, 3 sleeping bags, 2 heavy blankets, pillows for 5 people, an air mattress, some ground pads, and a little misc all crammed in there.  It was a little work packing it and getting it cinched down but that's the price you pay by not spending $$$ on a Yakima or Thule hard case.  It didn't rain so we can't testify as to the water proofness.  People complaining about things getting wet when driving in the rain have legitimate concerns but I don't think it's that big a deal.  If rain was anticipated I would never put anything in there that would result in a disaster if it got wet.  If there were a slight chance of rain I would simply place the things that I don't want to get wet in a plastic bag when packing.  Prepare for the worst and you'll be ready for anything ;)
B005I0IDRE|5|Thank you
B00V5J69AK|4|My truck sits amazing
B008427D88|4|good value for the price
B002QAU8MM|1|Didn't fit and it is only one side.
B009K4DKLS|4|Works quite well however, I am concerned about the longevity of the removable power cord. I think a better design would have been a cord that was permanently attached. Also, the courd seems very thick for a 12V device.
B003VUY72S|4|If you care about your engine Only OEM motorcraft / Racor filters should be used .
B00Z7KIZPA|3|My purse doesn't fit in the pocket very well but it works great for keeping my purse from falling into the back seat.  I do like it.
B000B8GAKA|5|perfect fit
B00WCDFH0G|4|fits and works as advertised
B000WJA5ZY|5|Great Product. Great Price.
B00LWS8Q96|4|This is super cute, although I didn't receive the same color that I originally ordered. I still like this a lot, I actually put it on my notebook for school instead of my laptop hehe...
B0049MVCL6|5|Easy to install, pulls our Sea Doo Challenger extremely well.
B00MATVMC4|5|Cool looking
B0053PLFYM|4|A month and 300 miles of driving [final 15 minutes each outing @ 2000 RPM] and the amount of smoke at idle is acceptable.<br />Have tried 3 brands all specify &#34;Injector Cleaner&#34; in the label. [ not just &#34;cleans injectors] All must be at least 15% cleaner in the fuel while driving around.Periodically run with normal 1/2% mix of cetane improver and fuel. I will continue until smoke is gone, which I expect will take another 300 miles
B00M8UHSX2|5|Awesome product! Nothing better than a nice breeze up your shorts while you cruise around in your Jeep!
B00CKINJ8A|5|Just what I needed.
B0009PYW3W|5|It's a bungee cord…and it's 18&#34;<br /><br />Not much more to it.
B008JYXYNY|3|They tend to come apart as you move them up and down the belt.  Though they are better than nothing.
B00267PZUK|5|Great tool! I tried the Ford special tool first, no luck, it's over engineered. The Lisle tool pulled the broken plug out on the first try.
B0000AXZKR|2|Spring broke a couple weeks after installing it.
B00KTJ0D2C|5|Cant beat the price and worked great for my 2001 Chevy Suburban
B00DE0VLO2|1|Would not recommend this product to anyone. Yes is very beautiful & nice to look at but the chemical smell overpowers the beauty and more important is my  concern. The back piece had no slits for the safety belt buckles.
B00YBMK3VE|4|Color is just as described.
B00K1HPIXQ|5|This was exactly the item I was looking for.
B00WVJPXU0|5|I have been looking for a light to see better at night, I am 65 and the older you get the more light you need.  After fitting the led headlights, you will notice a large difference in the amount of area it covers, the light is very clear. The brighter light does not bother other drivers, so no need to adjust the headlamps.  Harley wanted $500 plus dollars for their upgrade, so its a big savings.
B005FNKSMW|4|Over all its great for the price. The only complaint I have and why I rated it 4 stars is because you would expect the packaging would be better than a bubble envelope. When ir arrived and I open it the battery must have been dropped because a corner was smashed some.
B00018ZWFO|5|Exactly as promised.  Arrived quickly.  Good value.
B00OPZ9QDI|5|thought it would give my beetle a nice look back in  the pass with my beautiful perfect daisy licence plates. and just did that when placed  in the top of my rear twindow of my beetle
B0040HD0XS|5|good
B000A0CAM6|5|This was the right fit for my 2004 Santa FE. I found that the CA9798 that was called for was too large to fit.
B008ESIKCK|5|Came 4 days sooner. Perfect match. Did what the others reviews stated, and uses the old &#34;bottom&#34; half of handle so still matched my suv. Took my hubs not even an hr to do it, first time. I recommend getting replacement door clips at the same time. Big plus it came so soon, and for 85$ cheaper than the dealer and local auto stores!
B004ZKWNTM|5|Passenger side OEM rack boot.
B002P2YGEM|5|Nice add on for the RV!
B00B8ZI1DE|5|Great item. Meets my needs. Fits perfectly.
B00192JGDU|1|TERRIBLY CHEAP! total waste of money. when i opened the package the table was busted in the middle. It is very, very flimsy. waited too late to return it so its now my loss.
B000WJX4BQ|5|still works fine
B004OJRET8|1|Not as advertised.
B00GW3E7C6|3|this was difficult to<br />get hooked onto the seatrest posts.<br />The shelf is pretty flimsy - in fact, it broke off right away.<br />It is great for additional cup holders and small snacks.
B00AN5UPFW|5|Very impressive pads. Stop excellent. Very quiet and no dust. Impressed.
B00D3QWC1S|1|Crown 5012457AB didn't fit driverside for my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee w/o Vari-lok Dana 30.  Axle length and spline count were good, but CV boot is a different design from OE and rubbed against axle tube.  Tried to call East Coast Jeep, but they only communicate over email...they wouldn't pay for return shipping as they don't take any responsibility for fitment.  Part should have fit, but it didn't...my feeling, if you sell auto parts you should be willing to deal with this...it happens.
B00180FSLM|4|Works great for OEM replacement on GM 2500/3500 GMT800 trucks.  The zerk fitting relocation is kind of useless, as the sway bar bracket has a fairly good base on it that does not really line up with the bracket for the zerk fitting.  Also, if you are also installing the idler arm with this, REMEMBER TO TIGHTEN DOWN THE IDLER ARM NUT ALL THE WAY BEFORE INSTALLING THE ASSEMBLY.  I did not do this, and spinning the nut just spins the ball joint, unless you have an Allen key holding the joint, which you cannot do if the assembly is installed because the frame crossmember is in the way.
B001892VMC|5|Heavy, durable.  I've used it with a tow strap to pull many other trucks out of the mud and towed a few down the road, too.  The weakest part of using this product is definitely not in the product itself.  The connection between the hitch and the frame, or the hitch-pin itself will both fail well before this thing does.
B003CVPPFY|5|Just as I expected,great
B00APODKVC|5|MY SON REALLY LOVE IT!!!
B000C2ZK9W|5|Fits great and easily installed on a 98 sienna, over a year latter.
B00WVNMOE4|1|Was bent up bolts to short had hell time. Went a had used  them anyway should had return them but I am handcart need them now because could not get in my new truck
B001YB33TO|5|love it may need some more and soon.
B00MJ7U0FC|5|Looks like real carbon fiber
B006B28RX8|5|I installed these brake pads on my 2012 HD Ultra Limited with no problem. No squeaky brakes, great stopping power.
B00BCP93LE|4|I purchased the receiver as &#34;previously owned&#34; meaning it was a return. The thing is heavy and arrived in a pretty beat up box. The nuts and bolts were all there but the wire that allows you to pull the bolts though the frame was missing. I was very frustrated but managed to engineer my own out of an old spring and some wire. The receiver matches up perfectly to my 2008 Ford Escape and I am 100% pleased with the results.
B00P3XQI5A|5|K&N products always surpass expectations, and enhance performance. I have used these filters for many, many years, in all types of vehicles. I recommend them to everyone I meet.
B002XYZYBG|5|matched the color of the interior perfectly.
B000IYIUD2|5|great price for  this motorcraft part
B0052SF0LO|3|I have  bought a couple of these lights. I have had one in my back yard for 2 years now. It still works great. We just recently bought two more. One works fine and the other one only works when the dial is set on day time. So unless we remember to shut it off every morning it comes on during the day and the battery is dead by the time night falls. We couldn't return it, because it took my husband a while before he mounted them on the house, it was too late to return.
B004C443PS|1|Bought a small which is the right size but the gloves aren't consistent. One is smaller than the other and is uncomfortable to wear
B001W0FPDY|5|Very happy with shipping and increased brake performance
B002UC4TIK|5|Plug and play on a 2004 Coleman Taos popup camper. Took 5 minutes to install. Be careful when you put the spring under tension as it can shoot out and get lost.
B009DJWTK8|5|Perfect Fit to 2000 camry. Material is very good though it is cheaper price than orignal.
B00N58M6CO|2|unfortunately it would not hold a charge so I had to return it.  I wanted to exchange it but never received a response from the company when I emailed them.  Great idea if it worked.
B007QV0R7W|5|Works well
B00UR4O8IE|4|I ended up using the fronts only because I liked the no drill application. After purchasing, I decided I needed a bit more protection for the rear and went with the factory guards. They are simple yet effective.
B00O1QUUKY|5|I really liked this towel, it kept a nice cool & slight moist feeling with out feeling wet. Worked very well.
B00YRHHDAW|4|When I ordered this key ring in blue it wasn't available for a few days but I actually ended up receiving it earlier than the estimated delivery date which was great. The colour is quite nice and the leather is sturdy, it doesn't feel like it will start to fall apart quickly. The metal finishes are good also, even if the spring seems a bit tight.
B00062ZDAO|3|they do the job as advertised , separate wires
B0002V9IFK|4|Cleaned up an old briefcase just fine without much effort.
B00JC73BEO|5|Matches perfectly to Spicy Red
B004ZC3TFC|5|Works really well.  keep the battery charged on my antique car.
B0009IQXFO|5|good stuff
B001EYFN2Q|5|Easy to install works as advertised!!
B00SISDC5Q|5|great light
B000FGLQBG|5|Perfect for our Eurovan
B0045G6KFO|5|Good product for the price.
B000LY3PBQ|5|Quality Product! You pay for that quality for sure, but this is an excellent product.  Installed in 30-45 min.  Keep the bolts loose until install is finished, and then tighten it up.  My wife held it level during install.  Was perfectly level. Didn't have to tweet it.  Well worth the purchase!!
B0036QX4EY|5|took a chance with this product and worked great for my 02 gsxr 600
B00KWMO7V4|5|Cut to fit just how we wanted in an 06 Colorado
B006B2515A|5|Works great, looks great, great price
B007F19J68|5|instructions were clear and fit was perfect
B000CGV7UO|5|Seems to be holding up well on my SUV.
B007SCNWD0|5|Best in the business.<br />I own 6 trucks for my business and they all get WeatherTech floor mats. They stand up to worker abuse.<br />We have tried others but they don't hold up.
B00DU0UWO6|4|These were pretty good for the price. I'm using them now I have a 2008 keep patriot so the only thing was fitting the cover on the back seats. Difficult but not impossible and honestly they look pretty nice
B00QG9NXHG|5|Quick ship!  Great product.
B007772HG4|5|Great
B00CMU9E1C|2|Do NOT buy this for your ruckus unless you plan to fabricate a cover for your gas tank and wiring.  The only way to install this is to remove all of the stock plastic covering or make several fabrications to it.
B001ELVC4W|5|Ace great delivery
B00IR7DYLU|5|Very nice Blue tone
B0065T70KI|5|this rope is legit.  i was able to easily splice the rope to what i needed
B0002JMUV6|5|The best for your car!
B00MAQBPEM|5|This is the commercial style double sticky.  It is great.  CAVEAT:  Line up everything befo' you stick it on because this is hard to take back off!
B0093E8SRG|5|Not that I really LOVE it..... but it worked & fit Perfectly. It did its job.
B001I7ENN4|5|ordered these to replace my original carpeted mats (so i can keep those looking new if i ever decide to sell my car). the fit is spot on as i had expected being a Genuine Honda part. the drivers side front mat fits the factory retention clips perfectly! I love the look and feel of them and would recommend these to anyone w/ a Honda Accord. (the accord logo is a nice touch too!!!)
B00IT0AKOO|5|Just what I'd hoped it would be.  Was an excellent Confirmation gift!
B000MGWM62|1|This is probably my first ever negative review. The ties snapped immediately when tightening them up. Do not buy. They are junk.
B00R8O8JTU|5|Great quality, would come back again and again!
B0031GHBSE|5|easy to install.
B009XOTRBM|1|Very cheaply made and completely welded awful crooked.<br /><br />First off, I am intending on doing light-duty hauling with this. Just carrying a light-duty cargo rack. So for people out there, THIS IS NOT FOR TOWING, none of these 4&#34;x4&#34; bolt on's are AT ALL. Read the horror stories of stupid people actually putting too much weight on these, it's ludicrous.<br /><br />Anyyyway... Even if you're doing light duty things, this particular brand is AWFUL AWFUL. They're quality control is laughable. The hitch tubing was welded on completely crooked and even worse the bolt pattern was drilled into the plate so crooked it was mindblowing. Completely awful. Some bolt holes were drilled so close to the edge I wouldn't trust this thing to hold anything whatsoever.<br /><br />Amazon is wonderful, I returned it and they refunded me 100%. Bu this brand is awful.<br /><br />VERY CHEAPLY MADE. DO NOT BUY.
B00HTOB0NG|4|Universal for direct power from the head light circuits not for the HID kit with relay harness.
B005PBW4TO|5|Cool
B002ON0556|5|worked great on my 150cc scooter
B00ICNQ2A4|2|Shipping was fast, but packaging was not good.  Chrome on the part looked good, but the casting on the part was not very high quality.  I think this is one of those things where you get what you pay for.
B0031HALXA|1|This alternator was professionally installed in my 2006 F350 and it lasted only 2 years and 4 months!
B00DEC0LP0|5|Nice
B00R97JR4C|5|Great, fast shipping
B00S9OM0AM|2|Thier was nj o bow the rest of the plate was very nice just no bow. And for the price make it higher and give 2 plates.
B004XRTGEC|4|Very Nice
B0040CZ040|5|There's noting to say, there rivets and there is nothing to say.
B007Y5DKWY|5|Fits perfect to our '11 Subaru outback.
B002XATXRQ|3|Ben:<br /><br />I've had the Tsudo Fireball catback on my Mazda 3 for approximately 41,000 miles. It has gone through two winters. I haven't inspected its condition since it has been put on, but I replaced the OEM exhaust because it was rusting and about to be compromised.<br /><br />Installation was done by a mechanically inclined friend. It took a couple of hours. The only thing that needed to be cut was the old exhaust. For a while I rocked the exhaust with the silencer. Compared to the OE exhaust, this thing is LOUD. I was denied an inspection sticker at one facility. I've never taken my car to a dyno so I don't know if there are any HP gains but there is definitely some more pick up in the middle of the power band.<br /><br />For the past 6 or so months the exhaust has been &#34;wheezing&#34; and the tone sounds like it is full of air. I have to inspect the exhaust. From the sounds of it, a gasket has been compromised. I contacted a seller and they sell the gaskets for $10 a pop.<br /><br />Overall, I wanted to give my Mazda some power gains by adding this exhaust and a Short Ram Intake. This is easily one of the most affordable after market catback systems out there, but I'm not sure I'd buy another one.
B0036IA6JI|4|Everything I expected. Look great and works as it should. Wish I had ordered door clips at the same time
B00455L5WS|5|Glad I bought it, just what I wanted and needed.  Sturdy, compact, can be expanded so it can be used...fun color
B00AA5NU5C|4|Easy install and looks great. Would've given it five stars if it was cheaper.
B00RVFOTZY|1|i ordered these mirrors about a month ago for my 2004 Chevy Silverado..the mirrors arrived, and were in my home office for about a week or two until I found the time to put them on my truck. They were great for the first 2 days, until I noticed the mirrors shaking more and more as the days went on that I drove my truck. Yesterday I took them off because the shaking just got so bad, and that's when I found that the screws coming from the mirror had come off of them completely..i don't know if this is just a defect in the set of mirrors I got, but for right now they are by far the worst mirrors I've had and want a replacement of them immediately.
B00002N57X|5|This is the second one of these I have purchased, and both are very good and dependable.
B000XB24RI|5|battery clamps slipped on my 1991 Miata but they are old. I had to keep pushing on them to tighten.  Note: you need to modify battery hold downs to install this monster
B00B9F77RO|5|LOOKS GREAT, JUST WHAT I WANTED, DID NOT HAVE TO PAINT!!!
B00UUQHANE|5|Way bad ass
B004IZF8BY|1|Does not work on a 2003 Toyota 4Runner Sport V8
B000C9U126|5|Exact replacement for my '04 Century. SES light was on, opted for the less expensive fix first. Installed it, drove it for a day. Read and cleared code with scanner also purchased from Amazon. Issue resolved for less than $40 and no trip to the garage.
B008CE0W5Y|5|Installed them the other day and they still work after dunking them in the river a couple of times. They are nice and bright and look great. Didn't use the wiring harness because the existing works good.
B00VGHQ20S|5|Love them they look great on our truck thank you
B00M1Y3KZA|5|Fantastic transmission fluid for the price.  Fully licensed by GM as a Dexron VI product (license number is on bottle), so this is not some cheap knock-off.  You simply can't beat the price, and I prefer Chevron / Texaco / Havoline for my lubricants.  They are not as well known as other brands, but always a quality product at a decent price.  I used this to do a drain / fill & filter replacement on a 2004 Honda Odyssey, which uses Honda Z1 fluid (a Dex III clone), which has been replaced with Honda DW-1, which I believe to be a synthetic, low viscosity fluid similar to Dexron VI.  Many in the Honda community warn to stay far, far away from Dex VI and only to use Honda branded fluids as these transmissions are prone to failure-- however this product lists Honda DW-1 compatibility on the bottle (along with the Hyundai, Nissan, and a couple other Low Viscosity variants), so that's good enough for me.  Have only replaced four quarts (all that a pan drain will yield), but plan on doing another drain/fill at each of the next two oil changes, which will use up the whole case.  That should replace most of the old fluid.  So far good results and smooth shifts.  Van has 140k on original transmission.
B000GV95KE|5|Nice added touch to my Vstar
B00I176LPM|4|Looks great . Nuts already have rust
B00062YUXU|5|Nice and powerful.  Helped restore overall pickup to my 88 firebird!  I was a little worried that it might burn out my control module which is old based on other internet reviews out there since it's powerful and an old control module might over heat (probably due to dried up heat dispersing gel), but no issues and been using it for 6 mths now.  I've definitely noticed an improvement in pickup/power since adding this.
B002KSAZ78|5|Awesome for pulling interior pieces apart.
B000BGK2HE|2|Be very careful when installing this device.  It creates a disturbance in the water flow when not using a hose but more dangerous than that, the bottom hose threads are very sharp and can cut fingers during the install.  Also the product carries a lead warning which I found odd for a potable water device.
B00U6HYIGY|5|I was a alittle nervous order the rotor and pads. I'm assuming they are made in china. When I received the rotor I was impressed by the quality and finish. I have one ride so far on It so far and I am satisfied with the stopping power.<br />They remind me of tusk rotors.
B00DW6RTZ8|3|Very soft but slips down on my seatbelt
B000EQS3B8|5|Worked great to fix the loose connector on my 97 K1500 rear light.  Kept causing intermittent connections and losing the turn signal due to age and wear.  This took care of it.
B0000AXRH5|4|handy  for filling in hard too reach areas
B000C5A0OO|5|AAA+++
B00QVOCLJM|5|Product was more than I expected, excellent quality, price, service and delivery was outstanding
B001AUYN4S|5|Awesome product and easy install
B00BT76EQW|5|Came quickly and undamaged
B00MATVMC4|4|It is a fine, workable fuel caddy
B00HCTIW0W|4|easy to install if ya done it beforre!!!
B00JF5HR7K|5|Great product, very well made!  We just went cross country in a Nissan Pathfinder and this held the extra gear. Very rugged construction, easy to assemble and operate.
B000CCOL3I|5|My mechanic recommends Techron, use it twice during the year, helps prevent fuel injection problems.
B001DVY060|5|Excellent look. No power upgrade
B00GUO5D2A|5|Fit perfect easy install
B002L5DYI2|3|I was disappointed that the lights didn't have a lens on the back so I could see when the light is operating.good light but...
B002GTPEEU|4|cool product fits great although a little big
B00JJQ8VRA|5|Thank you
B006LVXRPM|5|Came fast, true to size and was easy to install.
B000BRFQLK|3|Works
B004U3NS5C|5|Great option for a step and still keep manufacturer rock rails in place.
B00EDWFX9Y|5|Installed and working on my Jeep,
B00JNHZ0QA|5|This fit perfectly on my 2016 Mazda 6 and looks great, at a bargain price as well. I live in an area where it gets hot in the summer (over 100 degrees), so I would recommend you do drill the holes to screw in the spoiler, since the tape will soften up at higher temperatures, and it could fall off eventually. I found the instructions straight forward, and I was very pleased that the screw holes matched up perfectly the first time. The only tricky part is that the two outer holes are made where there is an additional inner wall inside the trunk lid. I was able to get those bolts on with some difficulty by squeezing my hand in between them and tightening the bolts with a small ratchet wrench, but you can just drill an additional hole in the inner wall to make it easier (as suggested by the instructions).
B008TW6KPA|4|4 stars just because I was expecting more light lumens but it Does the job so far ;)<br /><br />May not be 6000k Of light
B005J6JRMM|5|This is perfect! Just what I wanted.<br /><br />The factory latch on the driver's seat is too low to reach easily when I pull the seatbelt around and I have to pull it up with my right hand while insert the latch plate with my left hand. Plus, the mechanism takes some forcing to stay in, so sometimes when I thought the latch plate was secure, it popped out while I was driving!<br /><br /> This solved BOTH of those issues! It is now much easier to reach and the belt clicks in with no issue for easy-to-reach one-hand buckling! This makes getting in the car and getting out of the driveway so much easier in the morning!
B00OFFLRY4|4|Even tho they were a better price on Amazon.. Still A Lot to pay for what they are!
B0051NNIFU|4|I can't give a 5 as I have not had long enough.  Very easy to install, looks great and appearsvery sturdy
B00VTA0KPU|3|Hoped for 15&#34; Mac. Because it's for 13&#34;, doesn't look as shown.
B0089I38MC|5|Fits perfectly and takes the glare of the dash off the windshield.
B00332GMKY|2|I returned this product because the tape came off ,tape is not too good
B0016LG0CY|4|Works.
B0075YY3SO|5|Just what i needed.  I use it on a Big Red 1986 but expect it will fit on a 1985 too.
B0009IK5US|1|Regretted almost instantly. These wipers stutter across my windshield even with heavy rainfall. Not worth the cheap price.
B00ISLA1WA|5|I love the adapter. It fits well onto my Mercury Mountaineer Class II hit and converts it to attach my cargo carrier. It is a very sturdy product. After looking ats everal options I chose this one due to the option of rising or dropping if needed, which came in very handy when traveling with the cargo carrier. I also plan to get a bike hitch carrier in the future. There was no rattling and it held very well. Bought the MasterLock 2848 Key Set to use with this and it worked like a charm. VERY VERY pleased with this product!Highly recommend!
B009VNDRZ2|1|Not fit. Went and bought one at local hardware store for cheaper price. Terminals were not the same size. Will not buy again
B005LTIU9S|5|Works great.
B00ODDKFLE|1|These are a non-standard size so they fit, but not very well.  Would not buy again.
B007VSDPCO|4|seems to work :)
B000GZQM9C|2|After only 1 month on the bike, the outer rubber pad fell off.  When I contacted Kuryakan, they gave me the part number of replacement pads that I could BUY!!!!  Seriously!
B000JZZTC0|5|Just put the pads on, so far so good!!!
B002HSCC68|5|Fit my 2014 fine
B000BQSL5E|5|My son loved it! Got it to use to decorate his Birthday Party and he loves working with that.
B00GU0OIBG|5|Looks great, fits great.
B001WX4E74|4|I will start by saying that I'm a clean car fanatic and have used several other brands of Quick Detailing products(Meguiars, Pinnacle, Local Detail Shops product).  I will start by saying that I like this product even though it takes a bit more than a few I've used to buff to a shine.  Once you've done that the shine left by this product is superior and at a lower cost.  I have used it diluted and straight as recommended and like the results of the diluted product better as it's easier to buff to a shine. I might try another CG product once I need more just to see if I like it better, but this is a good product at a great price.
B00DJ5KGRU|3|I might return these. They're described as a soft compound, but they're really not. The packaging doesn't even make a distinction between the soft and medium version, it just states that there are two versions! I even had my wife double check to see if I missed it.
B001GGJ7ZG|5|great detail and this is a tribute for a passing sibling.
B002FRUR9U|5|Works great on a 2003 Toyota 4Runner Sport V8.
B00J7RB72M|5|Great item exactly as described
B00H3CS0SC|1|The lid will not snap shut with a battery installed.
B000CODCOK|1|Item does not match picture / not sold as described. This is a nut not a hex head.
B0095D34YM|5|Perfect fit for E46 M3 2004
B002JBDH26|5|Perfect after 4 months!
B0038B1LJW|1|HIGH BEAM DOES NOT WORK! UGH! and then it just quit. Customer service is horrible. What a joke. I have read that it needs to be rewired but I have not seen any instruction on how to so. JOKE OF A PRODUCT AND COMPANY!!!!
B00NGSM0J2|5|Very happy with me decal
B00AV9EBIM|5|Awesome
B005KOZ25Y|1|Autel Maxiscan MS310 CAN no longer works.Sold by Great Neck Tools . I dont believe they will honor the return as they are no longer abel to be contacted.  I owned if for a year and used it probably 8 times.  It doesn't work now.  The machin only lights up when plugged in.  No letters or numbers in display.  I think it should have lasted longer . I did not drop it and only lightly handled it.  In the future I would be looking for a more durable device to check obd2 diagnotic codes.  This device definitely is not durable.
B000BZ6XJQ|5|AAA+++
B00NP93W4E|5|Excellent product easy to install.
B00O2XJ0PW|5|Perfect keychain! Love that the car key can be easily removed for the valet.  The color is more orange than red but I love orange so it's perfect.
B0023VFALI|5|Great product
B00QSLNJ26|1|Not as near as bright as standard bulb, Doesn't appear visible in day light, and  blinks like a strobe.<br />Led is on the left in photo I provided.
B00E4VY7VO|4|Works great and easy to install!
B003LIZ9FE|1|The look decent out of the package but are poorly designed. Jamb nuts will not stay tight & intermediate seals are too thin. Massive oil leaks due to these issues. Spring loaded push rod tubes seem to be way more reliable.
B00N6AHWCK|5|Beautiful keychain, great quality and detail.
B00DJDXL5Q|5|Bought this seat for distance riding and took a trip soon after I installed it on my bike. Very pleased with the comfort it added with a wider, deeper, better padded seat and a backrest. It was initially difficult to install on my Honda Shadow because it was such a tight fit but with some help, it was installed properly. I would recommend the seat as well as the retailer I bought it from who was very accommodating and quick with communication.
B00VE6HMH8|5|Very good fit
B0006VORDY|5|Love this stove. Easy to light, gives a lot heat. Easy set-up
B00FYZFE66|5|Excellent Quality
B001JT98IQ|3|My fault, I should have known it would still stink! But great way to put out a cigarette otherwise.
B0068M0SNI|5|OEM quality replacment for 2010-2013 Mazda3
B00ZOKJVAG|4|Good deal for the price. Doesn't quite cover the whole window (I own an Accord) but it does the job to keep the back seat shaded.
B00LWC3GDI|5|Can't beat OEM replacements. Great looking style
B000BZI4JI|5|Product fit my 98 Ford Ranger 4.0 perfectly.
B000CINV88|2|Bought this for an DIY brake job (pads and rotors). Did some research online and some people swear by this stuff, so I ordered a bottle. After reading the back label, it basically states that its not intended for use with shimmed pads. Of course, my pads came with shims are attached. I erred on the side on caution and did NOT apply any. I installed the new pads and put everything back together.<br /><br />Took it for a test drive and to bed in the brakes.... and there's NO squeal or noise. At this point, I probably have 400-500 miles on the pads and still no noise or squealing. After some more research and reading, I found that some people remove the shim from the brake pad and apply this stuff in between the 2. Just another step to prevent possible noise and squealing.<br /><br />I didn't use any and had no squeal or noise. But for $5 and based on the reviews, it's probably a good idea to use if you have non-shimmed pads.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;The sunshield works fine and is light weight and fits the windsheild very well. I am pleased to have it.&#34;
B004AQVF5O|4|worked fine
B004ZF3YD6|5|I have purchased the 8000k HID kit for my 2000 gtp and they are very bright and a very big difference compared to the halogen bulbs. It was an easy to install. Installation in less than 45 min. Lights are very bright usually don't have to turn on the brights. I will always stick to HID kit and kensun is a good company and get back to you right away with any problem. I would recommend this product to a friend
B000EQCXRI|5|with a little help from wd40 the change over went smooth.you could  not beat the price
B005493JGY|3|Works well and is very solid once cured and sanded smooth. However, you have to mix it yourself, it smells beyond horrible, it dries up and become unworkable within minutes.
B005FI5BBA|4|great license plate cover. only thing is that the plastic isn't very heavy-duty. i hope it doesn't break. other than that it's awesome
B0028SHNMU|4|Smart Wax is a division of Chemical Guys and this leather conditioner is an excellent product. I'm giving this Leather Conditioner 4-stars because its a great product but their product line is a little deceptive targeting retail consumers. Better information on how to use this product can be found under the premium line [[ASIN:B00FALVXLY Chemical Guys Leather Conditioner]] and watching their youtube videos.<br /><br />Smart Wax works great, its less expensive than the premium ChemicalGuys brand (both brands have the same address). The product smells like leather and it does a great job of conditioning vintage leather in a luxury vehicle with a matte finish (a tan color cream).
B0036L66I0|4|Like it. Have the same on the other vehicle.
B00X7DURKU|5|the relays is so good and professional,  the speed of the flashing is good.
B00QQS6O1O|5|Looks great on my wife car
B00HB9K55S|5|Very pleased with this. Almost looks like it came from the factory and it works great. Very convenient.
B00YM8JC1O|1|Piece of trash!!!!My MBZ  mechanic can't even put it in. It is fake emblem!!! The paint is so uneven, and disgusting!!!
B006GIG74S|5|Works
B005FCFE7C|5|Awesome sticker
B009NQ8L5S|1|It was the Right fit , horrible o-ring gasket , it's leaking really bad only drove 10 miles with it, took the o-ring back out to inspect it and already  was flat not round anymore .. bad gasket all together
B00DQJB7EK|5|2015 Silverado. Perfect fit, 3 minute installation!!
B00FSEU9YK|5|GREAT FINISHING LOOK FOR MY JEEP
B00192JGY4|5|At last I don't have to worry about how much is left in the tank! Very handy product!
B004AE0DAY|5|The local dealer wanted 300+ to replace this light. I ordered it for 55 basically and installed it myself in less than a minute. It looks just like the original one.
B00JL6MWIW|5|Exactly as described and installation was easy.
B001AWI054|5|Looks like it will do the trick
B000O5DUP8|5|Quality product!  Easy to use! Love it!
B00JVTWFMM|5|Works great
B005LDBU0U|5|will never ride without it should order two in order to have a backup
B00NHBYOA6|5|keeps cool a long time, and works really great.  Bought the converter, we go from car, to plug into the wall, and everything stays really cold!
B0002MSY6S|5|works great
B00SAEX67C|5|worked great. Easy install. Only needed one but went ahead and replaced the other since it came in a 2 pack.
B000COTPIM|5|Installed on 2004 Subaru Forester XS.  The previous plugs where NGK copper and went 30,000 miles, despite having oil get on them thanks to failing spark plug well seals.  These platinums now have over 50,000 miles on them and are still firing strong.
B00ZJKQR9O|5|works like a charm and not big and bulky .
B00029XBBE|5|Pretty great, I was doubting it but for the $ I said the heck with it, and I'm satisfied. It's pretty long and a lot too do with it.
B00NBNSFTQ|5|fit perfectly on my 02 Nighthawk and have been great so far
B0016LG0CY|5|worked great
B00F3J2FW4|5|Perfect fit in 2015 JKU.  Very pleased and would highly recommend.
B000TTILSK|5|Solid belt, good quality, gives your hood a nice color as well. I changed my belts whilst installing the lightweight crank pulley, so if you are considering such a thing buy these instead of the OEM's or such
B00NEL6HT0|5|Can't beat the price for what you get
B00LM5692A|5|I drive for Uber and Lyft<br /><br />A lot of passengers have complemented on the smell.<br /><br />I will buy more!!!!!
B0002KKIU0|5|Did a good job removing vinyl.
B007J8IIMI|4|it fits, but just barely. won't screw on all the way but just enough to close most of the gap between the antenna and the mount.<br /><br />also, the rubber base of the mount does not match the contour of the mount and my O.C.D. is exploding.<br /><br />have not tried the radio yet and won't test it extensively for a while... I usually play my own music. I replaced the old one for cosmetic reasons.
B00NM4GL36|5|As expected....just right for my keys
B00N4HT9Q2|3|unfortunately this mirrors did not like my truck they were very blurry at speed.
B00F91QIZ6|5|A must have for the dual sport rider. I ride at night and the guys that go with me always stay behind me so they can see the road in front of me light up like daylight. Awesome lights. Match them up with some floods like I did. You be the envy of your fellow dual sport riders.
B000SL2GNU|5|Good
B00T6JKXCG|5|Works well with the Smash bumper and gusset kit. It's a really tight fit with my Superwinch 4500# though.
B00CYGTKP4|5|good fit
B001V3131K|5|I bought a pair of purple tinted glasses when I had a concussion and it helped with light sensitivity. I bought these because the others wore out and I still enjoy wearing them. Color tinted glasses are also used in color therapy for dyslexia, autism, ADD, and slew of other things. (Look up IRLEN)
B0024NT0IY|5|good product for the price
B007WMGDXM|5|Super easy installation. Worked perfectly.
B00HWZU9HK|5|Can't even begin to tell you how much I love this!! I get so many compliments, as it's VERY unique out here - I wanted something different for my very &#34;different&#34; lime-green jeep wrangler! Searched for about 4 weeks on hundreds of sites before I started using Amazon's &#34;Other products by this vendor&#34; and then found a whole slew of them! Since I couldn't decide between 5 patterns, I am very confident this will not be the last spare-tire cover I get from this vendor! And you cannot possibly beat the PRICE for the &#34;HAPPY PEACE&#34; it conveys.
B00122EEK2|5|The Denso O2 Sensor is the same one used by dealerships when they replace your factory stock part.  They work great, zero issues with installation, it's an exact fit.<br /><br />Be careful when removing the old one that you don't tangle the wires up in your O2 socket puller and also make sure you hand thread and tighten the replacement sensor until you can't go any further - then use the socket and only use it for up to 3/4 turns at the most.  That way you can make sure your wiring that you just spent 10 minutes routing under the car doesn't get damaged!<br /><br />Lastly, be careful when installing the rubber grommet - don't rush this, make sure you have a good seal - it's the only thing stopping back splash from entering the passenger compartment in a very hard to see location!
B00N77MXNU|5|Excellent product, you know it works when people ride your bumper and then fall back about 20 ft. I find it kinda<br /> humorous
B004R35MQI|5|Very sturdy unit for my Pontiac Vibe. Switching from 2&#34; to 1 1/4&#34; is a breeze. Trailer hitch bike racks will have some wobble so for driving I ran nylon straps from the bike rack to the roof rack  which worked great. I'm much more comfortable driving with it tightened up like that. Also the hatch back will open without having to tilt the bike rack down. Cradles for bikes are sturdy and the strap system is excellent.
B001QVFD4K|5|it does appear light but does produce nice shine and you can basically spray it on anything, glass, chrome, whatever.  It smells yummy too! Update:  I love this stuff!  I have a lot of spy waxes but keep coming back to this one.
B00LU51UZ8|5|So far great! My glasses fit under them which was my biggest concern.  A little big. But when I position lower, it pinches off my nose and causes some airway flow issues. I have small features and have to buy kid size sunglasses. I'm very pleased with these so far.
B0006V2BPK|3|ill give this a B ish rating ordered 3, 1 had a bad fuse, other than that ill find a way to make a living off this stuff one of these days when the monetary and saftey standards of life crash and people go back to settling for a half-assed days work.
B00JGCDE0G|5|Work great, easy to install!
B000KID2ZC|5|great tool works great
B00DTBU6PQ|4|Saw this on my way back from Sturgis when I put in almost 5000 miles on my bike in two weeks.  It seems that it is a very good product and time will tell.  It is a lot more comfortable that the seat I had on previously.  I hope it will be as comfortable in the long run. I took away a star because it is very, very hard to mount this on the solo/rider's seat.  If you don't have a ratcheting, 7/16th combination wrench, get one before you even attempt to install it.  The directions they send are not for this seat, so you have to figure it out yourself.
B00GNG9N30|1|I purchased this product at Costco, not Amazon.  Due to Costco's generous return/exchange policy, I have gone through three of these.  They don't last much beyond one year and then it stops holding a charge.  The air compressor can only be used for very light jobs.  If you have a flat tire--the air compressor will burn out, as it will take 30 minutes to fill your tire.  I would not buy this brand, now that I have tried three times with no success.
B00E0I54FO|5|Worked like they are suppose to do. Headlights work properly with these resistors.
B00CNEQZHS|5|Came fast and easy to install
B0070Y341G|5|Excellent light for the license tag. great lights.
B009R57LBU|5|so funny. love it.
B00KNMKRU8|5|Works as advertised
B003V57NUQ|2|You get what you pay for. Quality not on par with my Thule racks.
B000BZKFZE|5|Replacement high quality, highly recommend
B001B5DCO4|1|Throw out bearing was bent and misaligned. Wasn't going to put my clutch change on hold for another week being my car half apart, so I used my old throw out bearing. The packaging is very padded. It must have been loaded with a damaged bearing.
B000C9P2W0|5|Great plug wires, ACDelco is a good brand.
B009T8LYWW|3|Just what it said.  Wife just had to have the VW insignia.  There are more rigid ones, but this will do.
B000VKXC36|4|This fit the 2001 Explorer Sport Trac perfectly. This was a warehouse deal item, so the pipe a little out of round on one end, but took less then a minute to fix and it fit perfectly.
B00KT1BH1Q|4|Works great to replace the lights on my instrument cluster! Very bright!
B000GTZD84|5|Beautiful product good construction love it! just need a left one now!
B002PNPF1E|5|Still holding on strong after being on my car for 8 months!
B000CGRR4E|5|The product was a s described and fit our 1999 corolla. The old part was kind of a pain to get out but the replacement works great.
B00KTHWT08|4|Best investment ever!!!
B0050FYZRE|5|great
B00KOEK0ES|4|This one is a little lighter pink then other pink decals I have gotten.  But it is a good size for center pice on the back window.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Very High Quality Air Gauge. Attaches easily to valve stem with minimal air loss from the tire. It makes a good seal without having to jam it down on the valve stem. The gauge is easy to read and it has high precision...you can distiguish between 32 1/4 lbs and 32 1/2 pounds, for example.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Its just as I expected it to be
B001INP9V8|4|Cute
B0014DINF6|5|It works. and shipped in good time. =]
B005FRC132|5|They even fit and Volvo XC 60 very nicely.
B00X61YA6A|5|It fits very good on elantra and looks  very nice!
B0041TNK44|3|The fan assembly installed exactly where the OEM Ford part was, perfectly.  However, the controller was DOA, and when I tried to install the original fan controller, the wiring connectors were different.  I'm not going to pull the fan assembly out to replace it, especially since I had to cut the wiring and solder the Ford wiring connector where it would fit the Ford fan controller, but it would be nice for a partial adjustment for the DOA controller.
B00J1KWNRS|5|work great good job
B001UC72UI|5|Worked great in my 08 Jeep Patriot no reset required.
B00LCFL45M|2|Disappointed won't show up on back license plate of any of my trucks. Will have to buy a plate for the frame to go around for front of the truck.
B0073MGJRG|5|Fit like factory, hope it holds up better.
B00EUN9KP4|5|My husband was so surprised with this gift and how well it was made.  Now all his golf buddies want one.
B002KO7G38|5|Nice.
B000JFL7ZS|5|Worked perfectly for a 2006 6.0 liter Ford oil filter and lower fuel filter. Its low profile and 3/8's drive makes it sweet for the filter that is tucked back inside the frame rail.
B001KSCSQU|5|Works great,  saved me atleast 20 dollars.  Fits my 2006 Silverado 4.3 Reg cab.
B00D99TQQI|1|Did not fit my 2010 odyssey. And they made me pay to ship them back. Don't buy them.
B00KWYL77Y|5|Stitched good, decent quality and durrable frabic.
B00FI7P2OY|5|Works Great!
B00K73QBKS|5|We call ours the Shadow Blocker 2000.  Shadow being one of our two dogs.  Now his brother Scout is content to look out the back window, but not Shadow.  He thinks he should be driving.  This net keeps him out of the driver's lap.  We have it hooked around the headrests and the seat belt brackets on the floor.  Works great.
B00H901KSK|5|I love them! Got a set of these beefy tie rods because the stock ones on my 2014 cam am renegade 1000 bent like a pool noodle. The AS tie rods and ends are both very stout and they also stopped the popping I had when articulating rough rocks and in sharp turns. Seem to be a great product and can't wait to put some more miles on them. I'd recommend these rods and ends to anyone that asked me.
B007KPWQ1Y|5|for quick storage it works great
B00G35GEQA|1|Junk, threads stripped out first use, tried using a bolt to finish work, then the centers broke out.  Shipping is a rip off, so even if they do refund, it will be less than half of what I spent on the dumb thing.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
B00V9HLRDC|5|Fast shipping! Excellent look and illumination, overall very satisfied
B00BJCN80M|5|I like these foam applicators. I do not use the microfiber pads anymore.
B00T70RFOS|5|Very good product, works well on my RV.
B004K23KQ0|5|Good Seller and Product
B00NQHZ0WC|5|Great LIghts! These lights are awesome, lightweight with great adhesive and very powerful and bright . Super product buy with confidence.
B00VNJ4N46|5|Great product.
B009G4D6HA|5|Love this paint
B00408H0XI|2|the exaust sounds good but i'm disapointed that it didn't fit will and i had problems installing it<br />also it's not the same as the picture your providing<br />in the pictures the tow pipes are connected together but what i got they're seperated from each other and i had problems from that<br />i got noises from the pipes cause they're not sticking to each other and they hit the under car metal and makes hitting sound
B00065L2D8|5|Worked good.
B00BQN5SUW|4|Product works like it should wiould defiantly order again
B00FFIZ9E4|1|If I could give 0 stars, I would. First off the welds are horrible, (which I could get fixed) however, I cannot fix the fact that the bars are 1) NOT centered. And 2) right side is higher than the left. This is horrible craftsmanship.  Material Quality is ok, but the way it's welded together is horrible. Not worth calling it a handlebar. It's a novelty item not for actual use.
B00O870QRS|5|perfect antenna
B0055PD1H4|5|All Meguiar's products are great!! They work!!
B007HSWQU0|5|looks great on my husband's motorcycle, he did have to trim it for it to fit the tank
B00OCYXTYY|5|A+
B000C9NAA6|5|Good quality. Perfect match to oem radiator.
B00GR3LSGO|5|Great Value! Thanks
B003VAUQFA|3|This can have some significant movement to it so think about how you mount it.  It has (2) 1/4&#34; holes drilled in the center rail for mounting.  If it had even a 4&#34; cross piece, it would stabilize this quite a bit.<br /><br />Also, most carriage bolts have a square shoulder to them and won't fit all the way down.  Having square holes would be a way of giving this a bit better finish.
B00LR4C83A|4|I have the 15 Tundra Platinum.  The interior light under the dash was a pain to put in, but got it done.  All other interior lights were great.  Also put in the reverse lights and changed the ones for the truck bed (by the third brake light).  Couldn't get the tag lights in the hole.  Square light, round hole.  Overall, these are great.  Add so much brightness.  I have yet to figure out why car manufacturers aren't using these yet.
B005NLQAHS|5|linked to my 06' GMC in just under a minute. used the torque light app. seemed to react quickly to changes. I used to have the other blue and orange box and it was hit and miss with low speed when connected.
B004RCRS9I|4|Very heavy for small car, I guess it's good for a truck
B000VKRQ7O|5|fit my daughter's Accent perfect! I replaced it in less than 5 minutes!
B0001L0DFA|5|Great nozzle
B00Q2NZ6LC|5|Item was just as described. Very easy to install and works great.
B000CIN83G|1|This came in a MOOG box but the product inside is NOT made by MOOG. MOOG marks their products directly, this item had no markings. two years later.. noisy bearing!!
B002Y2H8OS|5|not a cri-cut knock off
B003ZHGDBA|5|Very good mugen lip. I like it!!!!
B00HFK2R9K|2|They dont last<br />not sure why<br /><br />Awesome performance but would not buy again<br /><br /> second set done within six months
B001O0C4TA|5|Bought this for my '98 Tahoe towing a' 03 Colman Bayside.  Dropped my trailer to a perfect height.  Great hitch at a reasonable price.  Shipped free w Prime too....can't beat that!
B00852684M|4|These were fun. Cool colors. Make your bike kind of look like a Tron bike
B00QDWQSBO|4|The T10s are great, I am using them in my gauges.<br />The T5s are a little too directional but with no other option, They will work just fine.
B0039HD5TE|4|Well built, seems are strong zipper appears to be good quality. Word of warning, if you have a trunk enclosure this will not hook to rails properly, without the enclosure it works great.
B0057ZQJ12|5|Just what I needed!!!
B00UMQ5P8O|2|It does not sit flush on the panel. Very dissapointed
B000CIYNH6|5|good
B00HWI372G|5|excelent product fit perfet in honda civic 1999 coupe
B0009IQZPW|4|This is a great product, just a little expensive for what you're getting.
B0002JMUZC|5|The best ever!!!!!!!!!
B00TRDLYX8|5|Great value,  well made, with excellent customer service.  Thank you Boss Bearing!  Highly recommend
B0001MQ7E0|4|Wish it got a little colder but otherwise it works great!
B005271AZA|5|Nice product, well made, looks great on my Jeep Wrangler, easy to install but don't depend on the paper instructions. I found a 2-minute YouTube video that made it super easy.
B00IAB8QDO|5|Great
B00BJEZEL6|5|So glad I found em here , I recently had to replace the back bulbs on the back of the my speed cluster on my Toyota and this is the best bargain out there
B00SYOV2FG|4|good solid product
B000F7VKD4|5|Works great on getting blue jean stains off the beige seats in my Lexus.
B000C3XD90|5|Works good for me.
B00KQ1ALKC|5|Engine seemed to run better, so will probably order more.
B001HATY36|5|Works great
B0085BS8Y6|1|They were ok while they worked. I put them in the fog lights of a W210. I wanted a yellow bulbs because, they're for fog lights. It makes sense to put yellow bulbs. I had them installed for about 1 month and were utilized no more then 15 hours before one stopped working (see below). Color is a decent yellow (think of halogens bulbs, before all of the blue/white bulbs started hitting the market, but with a yellow hue), but far from the look and intensity of HID/LED yellow lights you may see in a Lexus. It may get you the deep yellow color you want if your fog light housing lens was also tinted yellow. Mine are not tinted yellow.<br /><br />One evening, it turn them on and I get a lamp malfunction notification from the car's on-dash screen. After looking into it, I noticed the fuse was blown. Replaced the fuse thinking it was just a fluke, turned on the lights again, and the fuse blown again.  After switching the bulbs into the other socket and only having one bulb in each socket, finally discovered that one of the bulbs was defective and was the cause of the issue. Went through 4 fuses (cost was less then $3). Notified the seller, they offered a refund/exchange but I have to send the bulbs back (plus they reimburse me for the cost of shipping it back). At the price point for the bulbs, it's not worth the trouble and my time to send it back and have to wait for them to send another pair. Just refund me or send me a new pair for free without needed me to return it. Good customer service is getting rare these days. 1 Star rating on the product. 2.5 star rating on the seller. They provided a quick response, but not an ideal solution.<br /><br />Unfortunately there aren't too many other options for yellow H1 bulbs. So if you really want these yellow H1 bulbs, I wish you good luck on getting ones that last or won't cause any issues.
B00O90DK68|5|Everything as promised!
B00DSD6T56|5|Great print quality and size is perfect for me.
B001EP292C|5|As advertised
B005DUNK2W|5|Great product at a great price
B000ABADXI|5|Good Quality !!!
B012X49ENY|5|[[VIDEOID:d3bc8bbe4456e8c526d7afd01db3a360]]Very interesting and novel storage organizer for the car. All black, 3 pocket pouch rest between your two seats as opposed to the traditional off the back ones.<br /><br />Easily installs by wrapping straps around the two head rests and clipping together. Basic strap clips extend and tighten for a tight fit. Has an additional bottom bunge style cord that wraps under your center console so the bottom isn't flapping around.<br /><br />If you have a dog you travel with that is supposed to remain in the back seat, this makes a great partition to keep him in the back away from the driver and passenger seats.<br /><br />I was given this product to write an unbiased review
B00IH01FRC|5|AS EXPECTED
B000VZJ6L8|5|This plug sure woke up my Yamaha! Expensive, but in a two stoke, every little bit helps, and this will do the job much better than that more expensive &#34;Bright&#34; plug sold here on Amazon.
B00E0SKBKC|5|works great
B005NLQAHS|5|For the price, you cannot beat this item.  Clears codes, views codes, and can view real time data.  You do not have to use their app, there are other apps that work with it too.
B00480J4PU|1|Very disappointed, i was expecting a white light as in ads and description. Above the Crystal Vision Ultra
B00QW3OMTY|5|Works great
B000NCOKZQ|4|Ok
B00V5005P4|5|These lights are well built. The light output is incredible. Could not wait to mount them on my truck.
B00RW2LTAY|5|Looked great on the side of the car. Instruction for installation was spot-on.
B00B27KM12|5|Great part.
B0081ST4V4|1|cheap. bends to easily.
B00OZULNES|5|THE LIGHTS ARE GREAT AND BRIGHT. I USE THEM FOR MY LOW LIGHTING IN THE YARD
B00E9FSPE0|5|perfect, just what I needed and for a fraction of the price the dealership wanted to charge me.
B00WOY33EA|5|Worked great...
B001N2O3PM|5|It's nice (:
B00BCN0B7G|5|Gives my baby the GT500 look especially with the GT500 carbon hood and wheels.
B009ZWAYJ6|1|This would've been a super nice seat cover, if I got it. Honestly, I was so excited to get it, but once I received it, very disappointing. I got the pink outline butterfly only. It said on here it was a pink zebra outline, but I received a different one. I just wish I got what I paid for.
B00H9FM8UE|5|allowed me to mount my Rigid D2s on my truck properly, I tired some other one before this was available and they did not align up correctly
B00480J4J6|4|head lights are good but not brighter as i expected but its worth.
B00ZG3T480|4|there was a lot more variety in this pack of stickers than another company i bought from. Yes there is logo stickers but not nearly as much as the other company i got from. Some of these stickers seem like legit logos but alot of them are movie refrences. Im glad i got these. I cant wait to sticker bomb my colorguard rifle. These stickers are not high gloss they are thin with a matte finish but that is perfect. Im using a high density car laquer to cover them so they stay on my rifle and can deal with drops so this is great :)
B00ZGHMSY8|5|Fit perfectly with my vehicle. Nice product for the money.
B006WPQNB2|5|Product works as advertised.  Been using it on my boat for the past four months and it is really a superior product.  Very attractive compared to all other available units.  Ease of use and ergonomic design make this unit a highly recommended development.
B005DUMX3O|5|Perfectly crafted gear!  Perfect fit, perfect function, flawless.  500 miles in 2 days, ran just like a brand new sprocket should.  Does not look like file photo, no biggie just wanted you to know.  I will upload a pic of the actual sprocket you will receive, check back soon if pic not up yet...
B00KY3YTDC|5|Perfect fit. Product is as advertised. Recommended. Note: It is not flexible and will take up cabin space. Passengers might be inconvienenced when installing or removing product.
B003TPB3ZY|5|I use this in my vw gti 1.8t with a larger turbo and full motor build works great!
B007TKGJGS|4|Magnets are much stronger than necessary. Not really suited for impact use, as one magnet came out. They are just pressed in, so no big deal. Flipping the magnet over and pressing it back in is fine, though you get maybe 20% of the magnetic strength. All in all, I'm happy.
B0051D3MP6|5|Just what I needed.  The led could be a little brighter; ... hard to see in daytime.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great sunshade. Very hot here in Dallas and this shade does the job perfectly. Excellent customer service, too.
B00JA80PEO|3|Not real loud
B00B79XIQ6|5|Got this as a joke for my Dad.... he loves it. Jokes on me. Works very well.
B000SQWVO4|4|This is a great item for your R/V. It reads well, and it tells you how much power you are receiving from your plug. Sometimes, however, I really don't want to know because other than unplugging the Whole R/V from the box there is nothing I can do about the camp's sub-par power source. That is not the product's fault though.  I would buy this again.
B004IU240M|4|Bought to take on vacation with us for me to rock my toddler to sleep in a new environment. Worked like a charm! Folds decently flat considering it's a rocking chair. My only complaint is that the caps on the end of the rocking rails fall off so I had to glue them on myself.
B00K6BDJYC|2|1 only lasted about 5 trips  i had bought a few others same seller and are working great
B00CLUYFNA|5|Once I read the instructions, they installed pretty easy.  Have not used them yet, but they appear to be able to hold most things I will tie down.
B007NGC0R0|5|my wife is quite happy with them
B00NWF73KU|5|It was the right fob we needed I would order from this site again
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is the perfect size for the windshield on my 2015 Highlander
B00ESAG3WW|5|Ordered  this to install on a customers new 2015 Nissan 370z. System arrived in a timely manner well packed. Installation was a snap requiring less then a hour using a over head automotive lift. Sporty idle with a aggressive tone at WFO. No dyno sheet to prove it but it feels faster!<br />If you want a sporty aggressive sound at a fair price, then this systems the one for you!
B00XZ9NOLU|5|Great product
B00KLCM86Q|5|Fit came in earlier than expected. It was easy to install
B000GZL16G|5|As expected.
B00YVC3W12|1|This thing is garbage and you can get the anti-slip mat at the dollar store.
B007USCM7E|4|works like advertised.
B00SH346D4|5|Super fast delivery. These are hard to find at the regular store. They worked perfectly. Now we have these vanity lights installed and provide very good lighting.
B009DK8A64|5|Worked as good as OEM part less than half the price
B001G8AIMU|5|Great backup source for batteries.
B00B9IX2SO|4|Easy to install, looks and functions great gives that little extra with out having to spend a lot more money
B00JNEBF1M|5|Great price! Great item. All one piece, chrome, very nice wheel nut. We'll see how long they last but so far they ate very nice.
B003VZI69S|4|This purchase came quickly and was just exactly what we wanted. Satisfied customer here!
B00HYHX8E2|5|They fit my 2013 Escape perfect.
B00A7W69JC|5|Great product, very pleased.
B00LSTF6SS|4|Tire cover fit as indicated.  Time will tell if the materials are durable.  But it fills it's function and I thought the price was reasonable.
B005KOZ25Y|5|still working fine
B00COTODL2|5|Fits perfectly.  Arrived as expected.  Looks great on truck.  Took less than 5 minutes to install.  Would buy again.
B002UW3A4Y|3|this item is not for 2012 mercedes benz sprinter 2500.
B00K74STWK|3|The cover kept blowing off and besides the built in center strap  there's no grommets to attach bungie cords to. It lasted about a year before it started to completely fall apart.
B0081KAW18|3|Works as intended.  Sides begin to bulge and does not keep a boxed shape when items are stored in it.
B0066TIDZS|4|Although it looked different than the Mercedes OEM part, it fit perfectly. It seems to work fine since installing a week ago.
B00069QLVC|2|I have purchased this product in the past but on this purchase the product is smaller In its dimensions and could not be used for the purpose I had intended to use it for. The quality of the product is excellent just too small for my use.
B00K5XOVFC|5|Great kit. Fits perfect on my 2014 MDX. Easy install and you save alot of money and installing this kit from Amzon, then going to the dealership.
B002UCYRZU|2|doesn't work like you would think magically removes scratches. basically noth worth the money. it should be last option if you looking to remove scratches.
B000CO93NO|5|Works great! Better than factory! Mine on my 2001 Camaro went bad and putting this on here solved a lot of my problems! I have the coldest AC I've ever had in the four years of owning the vehicle
B00HU8Z96K|5|It's held up thru my last three bike washings which is something I've never gotten any other wax to do.  Also, if you have lovebugs where you live, it makes them easier to get off.  Great stuff.
B002XLHUQG|5|Glad I made this purchase.
B005BD19M4|5|great and easy installation of this product
B001L29CFU|5|Perfect for carrying my electric wheelchair.
B0024NWX4C|5|Awesome!
B0119SS1PW|1|200 stickers and there all doubles of the same thing I got 4 bags and all doubles not worth the money
B0068M31Q4|5|Great plugs, restored smooth running.
B005NLQAHS|5|I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this item and I'm glad I did. This little gadget is amazing. It works great and if it comes up missing I would have another one on the way before the sun went down. Good Job
B00MU3R5T4|5|Very nice bulb
B00HX526CU|1|I purchased this LED light in June and used it one time.  Went to use it today and the light wouldn't turn on.  Replaced all three batteries with fresh AA batteries and the light would still not turn on.  When the light worked it was great.  Now I'm left in the dark after only one use!
B0006IX7Y2|4|Exactly as described
B00HYHZM9Q|5|They fit my 2013 Escape perfect.
B000JFHNQA|1|Not even three months later it stopped charging it self.  I did nothing wrong and followed all the instructions.  I have to send the box to kansas to have them put a new battery in it already.  I am not impressed.
B001AWD6LW|4|The material is pretty rip-able, the sewing between the fabric and the strands that tether to the car itself are pretty weak.<br />That being said, it's pretty sturdy for the price. The thing's lasted me through a month of use and its saved me from a panic assembly of my soft top in the middle of the night atleast 7 or 8 times.<br />BE CAREFUL: If you don't have a roof on at all like a bikini top or something, rainwater can slowly pool over the top of it. If that's the case, you need to wedge a broom between the floor and the roof of the tarp to prevent the weight of the water from overburdening it and turning your car into a fishtank
B00IY3YLCI|4|Good little lights just what I needed but like they say u get what u pay for cheap LEDs seem to interfere with radio frequency
B002OPLV2A|2|Broke a spoke on the umbrella already
B000ALG86E|5|Oh man, this cover fit my spyder to a &#34;T&#34;  Good job to the manufacturer and to Amazon for connecting us. Kudos.
B0066TKPNG|5|Excellent price. Fast delivery, and now, I have windshield wiper again. Haven't had it long enough to comment on durability, but so far, I'm happy.
B00VHUAVWO|5|Good quality! Nice backing, and easy to apply a perfect placement!
B00DX8AQRI|5|Item was exactly what I needed to get my scooter running again. The belt fit perfectly, not only on my bike but on my wallet too.
B009V06W98|5|Love this bag. My dog is a little heavier than the weight limit, but she seemed comfortable.  We let a family friend borrow it to try with their dog...they liked it so much, they ordered one too.  Only down side, one of the internal straps broke on the first tug.  Would recommend reinforcing all straps for pet safety.
B00GPUIZ42|5|It's America, what's not to love?!?!
B000EDOSS8|3|what can i say about gutters
B00CQ8NF7E|5|I love this lanyard. I attached mine to my wallet . Love the bottle opener on it . Works great ! Lots of compliments on it .
B007ISYE1I|5|I bought two of these to run duals on my 5.3 Silverado and I love the sound all my friends thinks I have a 6.0 under the hood well worth the price.
B001NYNFTU|4|good product
B00KTHUMJI|5|Perfect replacement for the outer shell of my 2007 Nissan 350z keyless remote. Took 5 minutes to switch it out; works great!
B0027VDRIM|5|Once you unscrew the set screw and pop out the safety button, it's a true quick release.  Love it!
B000JZCZRM|5|So far so good.  Installed these about 400 miles ago after getting the loud hum at highway speeds and around corners.  Only my driver's side hub was bad but you really should replace these things in pairs.  Hardest part was getting the old one out of the steering knuckle - took a hand sledge hammer and a ton of PB blaster!  Anyway, the plug in ABS sensor has operated flawlessly and the hub has as well.  Just have a good torque wrench on hand to properly torque the hub bolts to spec and you're all set.  Purchasing the Moog part from Advance, Autozone or another store will cost you more which is why I purchased from Amazon.
B000C16XM6|5|Worked Great!
B00EVQHYOE|3|Pretty loud but not a deep tone.
B002XF382W|5|Excellent. Works very well.
B0046BJSNE|5|I bought this product 2 years ago and it is still holding up great. I love leopard print and I was excited this print did not look cheap. It did have a smell when it arrived but it faded over time.
B002LNX8FS|4|Great price and comfortable. Well padded!
B00C30A00K|5|Look great but don't fit my Nighthawk.
B0002SQYC8|5|Very happy with this product! High quality stuff as always from Meguiar's. Left my car with a superb shine!
B004UTCXQQ|4|Just love it, thanks
B00FFC880M|2|You get what you pay for.
B00H7DT0UY|3|The battery was damaged but the factory box was not indicating that they threw a damaged battery into a good box.
B008CE06ZA|5|Great price and easy to use.
B006GJLIFK|1|Poor quality.  Worked great for a few months then started poping and banging when driving.  Very noisy.<br /><br />Ended up taking these out and putting the stock lower control arms back in.
B002724RS0|5|Love this. I use it on my motorcycle and snowmobile. I don't need to wear a lot of layers, so as the day warms up I don't need to stop and take anything off. I just turn down the heat level.
B00BTSFN54|1|Dead on arrival.  I tried to charge it using the provided cable.  I used two different power heads.  One was an iPhone power head.  The other a generic.  The red charge light would stay on for a second, 2 blue flashes, then stop and turn off.  When it was charging (red light steady) - it would stay red for about 10 minutes, go dark, then not be charged up.  I have Prime - thankfully - so I just returned it.  When I read the Sena forums - a lot of people have problems updating the firmware.  Also, the firmware is only good up to windows 8.  Mac people had trouble too.  I'm just going to get an older version I think - or another brand.
B005XRRBKC|5|Beautiful lights, very easy to install, took me only about 25 mins. They are definitely plug and play, would highly recommend!
B00KTHZVFI|5|When I went to the Dealer to get this key programmed they were saying aftermarket keys like these frequently won't program and said I was going to have to pay tor the programming whether or not it would work and wanted me to buy their $240 key.  I took a chance and it programmed just fine.  It looks and feels exactly like the original key and saved me a lot of money.  I'm very pleased
B00HQQXOPO|4|Easy to install nice fresh look on the interior but license plate lights did not work.. their polarity sensitive and when you remove them it damage them. Overall good stuff
B00KY0AQOQ|5|I installed this last weekend in my 2001 Chevy Tracker. It was a perfect fit and worked as it is supposed too. Very happy with this purchase and the price was 1/2 of other places!
B002PUTC0M|5|Outstanding.  Very professional constructed, easy to use and very effective.  I've been performing auto mechanics for thirty years, and this is an exceptional product.
B0051WVPB0|5|Fits my 17.7ft Yamaha XR1800 perfectly.
B00GXRH192|5|Great Product!
B00YZJ4BZM|5|These are pretty sweet. And look great in my car.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Really Works!  I have a small SUV, no place for the purse when I have another person in the front seat.<br />I'm carrying a light colored purse right now and noticed it was getting dirty from setting on the floor.<br />I order the Purse Pouch, installed it and Problem Solved!!
B002R38TCE|2|Nope. returned. It sheds like nuts.
B00IM39A6M|5|Worked well for my 2002 Ford Windstar. Difficulity of changing this spark plug on my vehicle was 6/10. There are about 2 spark plug that is hard to reach and change.
B001LEYEG0|4|Great Product
B00JNEAPRM|5|Arrived quickly<br />Good quality product<br />Perfect fit at the right price
B005FL5PHM|5|Stops like a dime. Looks fantastic. Keeps very cool and has improved stopping.
B000QQZ9F4|5|Same height as oem. Coils are thicker. worked great.
B008XNV8DY|3|3 stars only because it the square box gets Too hot quick
B00A4KW234|5|Perfect fit, strong and sturdy
B00A8MZ7IA|5|I am happy with these towels. High quality, I use them to buff off wax.
B0097ABRR4|3|I almost hate to only give this a 3 star, and partly it would be my fault.<br />1) It is brighter than a previous version I had purchased from another vendor, much brighter.<br />2) It is not size replacement for a halogen H3 bulb, it's considerably bigger both in length and width.<br />3) Modifications have to be made to enlarge the opening that the previous bulb fit into easily.<br /><br />With that said, this bulb is going into a Golf Cart, not a car. I don't need the brilliance of a car head light, but this is not as bright as a car headlight, just the brilliance of maybe a Fog Light.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with the lights, just that I didn't expect the modification. Carefully read the size spec!!!
B00JIIZCM6|5|This cleaner does work, It worked pretty well on my wifes car which had spilled juice and candy on the back seats.
B0012ILZAS|5|Only one word.... Damn!!!!!!
B001DKP7JA|5|Looks and feels solid, hope the internals are as good.

B000AOLUM8|5|Workes great
B00C5T04K0|5|Perfect for the little things I use everyday that can now just fit in this on the door. No more digging to find them.
B00A86NIWI|5|Longer than OEM but worker great on my 2003 bug.
B00ATEB6A0|5|Great deal
B000GU03J2|5|Fits well. Nice piece.
B005EV276A|5|No hassles
B004KIOU8G|5|Cool decals I love the design I have no idea what I'm going to do with them but I just had to have them.
B00EJFH6YA|1|The lights went out on it in the middle not even a month after being on my truck.
B00BOHYNS8|3|Product was not size specified. Size was 5&#34; x 1.75&#34;. They were 5x2.5 Overall including the bracket. Wiring kit was good excepting the tiny relay which I replaced with a good headlight relay which required cutting off the original plug. Lamp ends had both round and spade connectors so replacement of different bulbs could be done easily. Included fuse holder was nice. The touch-button switch was too easily turned on accidentally so I replaced that also. Looks like a good product for the price.
B00504TYD0|5|Like it
B000C7YRNM|5|keeps temp well
B0034ZMVKU|5|Perfect!
B00TUKY7VE|5|The boyfriend loved it
B000BQY996|4|It worked as described just don't leave it down to long or it will attach to the surface and will leave sticky residue. This is more my issue than the product.
B0068EQG50|5|Fit my bike as advertised. No leaks after 6500 miles.
B0080PBLPU|5|These are great belts, have used them in multiple Polaris RZR's. Would highly recommend them.
B000EBMLIY|1|broke after 1 day, much lighter than stock
B0052FRY1Q|4|Good value for the money
B000RXNLK6|5|Best product to use on your car
B00SH1SN6C|5|Looks nice, light is good, it is compact and light weight. However, I have not had a chance to use it for jumping a car.
B00P8H6CY8|3|No issues with the devices performance.  However I purchased NEW devices and used devices were sent from the seller.  Both (2) Devices showed clear signs of wear and previous owner's configurations were still in the devices.
B00JD6D1YY|5|Great
B00BEWZ9JU|3|The bottom grill does not fit a 2011-2014 dodge challenger . I had to sell the bottom one to someone who had a camaro and purchase the bottom grill from somewhere else
B000IZ9T4U|4|it works as expected
B007Y5GQBQ|5|Fits perfectly in my 2012 Jetta SE
B001SL9LL4|3|to big
B00SFKMRT4|3|Agree with others, the grey isn't. It's just a different shade of beige/putty. For reference, that means the beige is likely a cream/ivory.<br />Just go with black, if you need true grey, because you won't find it here.<br />Otherwise, it's a generic fit for most cars and is okay. It is half the weight of the original and more expensive Drop Stop, but still fit well in our two front Volvo seats.
B00GLI7EPY|5|Arrived in short time. Immediately replaced all fairing bolts when it arrived and now looks uniform and all are the same. Happy with this purchase.
B000YQQZCW|3|handy
B000FW7VH8|5|good stuff
B00H7R2R28|1|I bought three of these and within a few days they all broke. Didn't expect much for the price, but expected them to last longer than they did.
B00J3NPOM4|5|great
B00IFZPWXC|5|Have had these in my RAM 1500 truck for 6 months.  Very high quality and no fading (we live in Florida so sun all day)
B00HR26XZU|5|Lights up my 2005f150 way more than stock bulbs
B0007LMBVI|5|Smooth as glass. Just what I wanted with quick delivery too.
B00LO0M918|5|Good bulbs and good price and fast service
B0049EUAEY|5|Worked exactly like its suppose to
B0002JMIEK|5|I have been using Liquid Glass for years and will continue to use..  Good Product
B002OUIXU8|5|So easy to hook and unhook due to sliding collar!
B00C6B54FW|5|I bought 2 of these for the front windshield of my vehicle and I use them when storm chasing and in the middle of the storm.  Part of my windshield is tinted where they sit but they can still be seen just fine by other vehicles.  Really great price, no complaints.
B00BHK6NOO|5|Part fit correctly and was complete with new clip and hose clamp. I'm pleased
B00K73X020|5|Seems to be excellent quality. Bright and sturdy.
B011J7BQE6|4|me like, fits the V-Strom just fine, as well as the mounting bracket for the Garmin GPS. only reason for 4-stars is the fact that the bolts to keep the angle are difficult to access without removing the windscreen. not a problem for initial installation, however, when needing to adjust the angle, its a pain to get to, even with the proper tools
B0030VB6F4|5|Fit perfectly.  went right into place with no problems at all.  Will order form this supplier again.
B000EQ7A9O|5|Replaced and was same size as original.  No complaints and would buy again.
B0072UOXXQ|5|These are heavy duty bars.  I  installed them on a GMC 2500HD Diesel.  Box arrived ripped at end so missing a bag of bolts for one side.  No big deal as I used existing hardware from OEM running boards.  Steps are two inches lower than OEM which works for me.  Install on driver side easy, passenger side with DEF tank a real pain.  Probably 1 1/2 hrs install on that side.  All in all very please!
B009DK8C1C|5|fit 03 Buick Century perfect
B00CHY63FS|5|My 2007 Audi S4 (B7) sedan kicked on an airbag light from my passenger seat due to a known bad connector underneath the seat. This cleared the light up quickly and easily after I fixed the connector. I will be keeping it around in case the light reappears or my over-engineered car decides to start throwing other lights due to some bad secondary sensor on a back-up tertiary system. You can also go to your mechanic armed with information so he doesn't try to sell you a flux capacitor for 800$ plus labor.<br /><br />If your Audi is getting near 100k in miles, lights will start to come on. With this tool you can find out what the issue is and make an informed decision about repairs. Or, of course, you can always pay the dealer 100$ to scan it and trust that they are being honest with you...because mechanics never upsell unneeded equipment and repairs to uninformed Audi owners.
B004I16L0A|5|Delivered as scheduled. Looks great and was easy to install. Keep it up.
B0009H51NK|5|very good
B005HR1V3G|3|I bought a Kuryakyn LED kit (turn signals and tail light/brake light) years ago, and after about eight years, the tail light died. So, I replaced it with this model (bought on Amazon). It worked flawlessly for two months, and now I have no brake light. If it had continued to work for years, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />The good is that Amazon replaced the unit and shipped it overnight. If the new one works for years, then I will update this to give it five stars.<br /><br />From a looks and fit standpoint, this thing is great. Just wish I would have gotten more than two months out of it before it took a crap.
B00AWREHXM|3|The pros are price, lenses. The cons are straps, foam.  I'm surprised to see so many 5 star reviews, these are a far cry from a 5 star product.  I think folks are just bedazzled by the price alone which is a fair deal.  Overall not bad and certainly worth 9 bucks.  Serious problem with the strap clip (tensioner), which tends to sit right behind your ear, causing discomfort.  Helmet amplifies this, really making them useless.  I will redesign my own strap to fix this, and I don't mind because the lenses are nice and worth the effort imo.  The manufacturer could (and should) place the strap clip a couple inches back on the strap, easy remedy. They clearly did not give much thought about end user comfort.  That would have earned 4 stars.<br />  Better (more durable) foam, or even better yet, rubber surrounds would have earned 5 stars easy.  They used the cheapest, weakest foam, this stuff will be useless after a few trips.  I will also modify this by making my own rubber surround.  Still, all things considered, a 3 star product @ $9.oo shipped to my door is ok with me, and the lenses and frame are worth my mods to get it right!<br />  ***Note to manufacturer:  upgrade the straps and surrounds, charge $15.oo shipped and you'll have yourself a 5 star ringer!!  Own the market.<br />  Cheers!
B00WFHZBYQ|5|Super easy to install! I have a 2015 Tundra 4.6 liter V8.  Per the instructions, I left my battery disconnected over night after I installed the module (3 minute install). Next morning I hooked the battery up, cranked the truck and it died immediately. ?!! No worries. The new settings just needed to be read by the computer. 2nd crank right up. Pulled away from the curb and COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE!!! FROM THE START my truck now pulls very quickly off the start and shifts through the gears without that &#34;bogging down&#34; effect you get from the stock 4.6 liter. My fuel mileage went + 3 mpgs on the HWY and +4 mpgs in the CITY ( 87 octane w/10% ethanol content). Driving down the highway in D, this truck does not shift up and down all the time like it does from factory. At 55 mph I can get 21-23 mpgs. At 70-75mph I am getting a decent 17.5 mpgs. It has way more &#34;GET UP AND GO&#34; when you step on the gas. Throttle response is about 500% better. It actually makes me mad that a company like Innovative can tune your Tundra for $69 better than Toyota does from the factory for $30,000.00..???  NOTE: I previously installed a $300 K&N Cold Intake system that did NOTHING for me.  A $69 Innovative chip made my truck a completely different animal!  Can't beat it!  NO CODES FLASH, NO WARNING LIGHTS COME ON, JUST GREAT POWER AND GREAT GAS MILEAGE!!  The two wires that you want to find are the 2 wires on the MAF that are the BROWN wire, & YELLOW w/BLACK STRIPE wire. ( marked #4&5 on my MAF)
B001CLB6E0|5|excellent!!
B00AQAFAVI|5|works great
B009VZ5VA4|5|These wiper blades are exactly the same as the OEMs from my Toyota vehicles other than the name stamped on them.  They last for a long time without leaving any streaks, and they look better than some cheaper ones.  They are a lot cheaper than the identical wiper from the dealership, especially when they are on sale on Amazon.
B000EALHHG|5|good product
B00IKKS4W8|5|10 times stronger than what's on my trailer. I plane to replace all 4 with this jack!
B004HKQ35U|5|easy install, 15 mins. lots great

B00O2RRT7O|5|I love! It was super easy to put on. Definitely recommend for the price!
B003JVWK50|4|works like it should.
B00XULVDHK|5|The size is a bit small but other than that it's a great product. Does a good job of keeping the sun out.
B008ZI66NY|5|Must have, required by law!
B00T6J8SV4|4|This is a very easy to install tank bag.  Works great.  I can use my gps, and iphone through the plastic.
B000C9IIG2|5|Like glove
B00F5MUB66|5|Best RV/Marine shower head I have ever owned and I have owned quite a few. I have one in both my motorhome and my boat. Can't be equaled in a 12 volt pumped water system for both low water usage and quality of spray pattern.
B000FG9XJS|5|Exactly what I needed...just didn't enough rolls.
B00N9L989Q|2|Bit too large
B000BUOSGQ|5|perfect for grocery bags
B00ZWTWDQI|5|Very easy to use tool for me, a beginner jewelry maker.
B000BKJDKM|2|Socket is loose. Always get disconnected.
B00514C18Y|5|Very nice add on. very well maid, we are very pleased.
B001DBTVHI|1|I have a 1998 Cherokee and bought this cover because of the typical rubber plug leaking.I read the other reviews  that say this we fit basically all Chrysler 8.25&#34; rear axles.Yes the bolt pattern is the same and it lines up just fine but on my Jeep when I removed the old one and compared it to this one and  I noticed the fill plug was lower than the original and you wouldn't be able to fill it up to the proper level and therefore the oil wouldn't get out to the wheel bearings.Needless to say i did not install it.Its says its for older Chrysler and iI guess the axle is lower on the diff. carrier or something.
B000IY8ODS|5|Smoothed out my rough running motor. Looks nice under the hood. Perfect fit for !999 Civic LX.
B00X0XANKQ|1|Don't even waste your money. Letters are crooked, not in a straight line. I wish I could post an image of what it looks like. LoL. What a train wreck!
B00UKXSEWS|5|Awesome tint for the annoyingly chrome subie lights!! Came with excess so they fit with extra which is awesome. Hard to put on the side lights but still comes out looking sick!
B003VASGOS|5|Works very well
B00GHSD3O4|5|A+++, as expected, thanks.
B007Y58X8U|3|The only problem is that the width is too short leaving about 2-3 inches on both sides of a 2013 Infiniti JX 35.  Might return and buy more expensive custom fitted one from Weather Tech.
B0031HEIDY|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2004 Acura Tl fog lights. Took about 10 minutes to replace and looks great!
B00PGYS674|5|Exact fit with the same OEM construction and quality, only price is way lower than at the dealer. Easy to change with included instructions. Also check You Tube for instructions.
B0010GCAWY|5|Got it today, have yet to install, looks just like original, would have bought sooner but fitment guide said it would not work for my application, found a review that said other-wise took the chance glad I did. Shipping was way slower then I was hoping for,but if that's my only complaint then rock on. If everything works upon install then I will upgrade star rating. it was installed and window operational in under 15 minutes.
B005R27ZK4|5|Quick and easy to install. Made seats look new again. Price was very reasonable.
B002R0B9R4|5|Helped fix the problem with my brother's 01 Venture rear lights going crazy.  GM used way too small gauge wire for these lights and it causes the connector to get too hot and start melting.  Don't just replace this part though, you need to also replace the 6 way connector, PT246 part number ACDelco.  I'd also recommend adding a larger gauge ground wire to the frame near the lights, I used a 12 gauge to help prevent this from happening in the future.
B00403LNQI|2|Kind of works.  Did fit my 214 Jeep Wrangler just fine but was a pain to install the U bolts over my Rola Cargo carrier.  Needed to spread the U bolt just a tad which was no easy feat to make it fit.  Also had to tighten the heck out of the U bolts to eliminate the wobble.  It eventually worked out but not as simple for me as others have found it to be.
B00AESZ9KE|5|For my brother in-law the retired Marine's birthday.  The perfect gift.
B006G1ER7Y|5|Fit and finish was spot on will purchase from you again.
B000FFR404|5|nice
B002GU4SN2|5|Great product
B000C17G5E|4|It worked for my 97 Lesabre but be careful not to overtighten it since it is made of plastic.
B00EZ9Y33W|5|Looks good. Can't hook it up yet but hopefully it works. Fast shipping!!!! Def looks like a high quality product and included the connectors!!!
B0094JZSR8|2|Keep this in the truck and is a decent tester, worst thing about it is you have to push against the gauge for testing inside duals, this can make the case loose, which if you lose the screws on the case will make it not read accurately.  Be sure to pull off the rubber protector occasionally and keep the case screws tight!
B001G3Q3O2|5|Searched and searched online for info for my 2007 Town and Country 3.3l with this and no luck! Finally recognized a picture on a BMW parts site and got a part#. This fit the bill perfectly. Shipped fast..
B00HZOBJHM|5|These mats are nothing short of amazing. Durable easy to clean plastic will last for a long time. Perfect fit in my explorer. Installation takes about 5 minutes. Hardest one is the drivers side matching the stock carpet holders. I would love to know if there is a fifth piece that goes underneath the cargo area when the 3rd row is open. Emailed maxliner for this information but they never replied. The only down side I can see is they will take a bit of maintenance if you like a clean car. All little dirt particles are highly visible. Definitely getting a set for my other vehicle.
B00UMDXGYC|5|worked great
B00BCRMA9Y|2|Not good
B003L2XPBK|5|Solid product.
B0009SS9CY|5|Perfect replacement cord end. Super heavy duty, quality bits and pieces
B009YY3M8K|5|This item is legit!  I was pleasantly surprised at how well made it was for the price.  They are a little shorter length wise than what I expected when I put it on my bar but that's not problem as I plan on ordering another one and I should have just read the dimensions.  This is great for a collector in a mancave and makes a good add on to the bar!<br /><br />As always Go Bucks!
B001KSCEXW|5|This saved me tons of money. Had no problem fitting this on my 2002 Trailblazer
B00BGEO7DK|5|Very pleased with the thickness and quality of product!
B00EPDLIS6|5|This is by far my favorite Duke Plate! It is beautiful when the sun hits it and reflects back onto the pavement. 5 stars!
B00KSUA6HY|4|Works well, but not large enough to fit? (I'm not very technical) basically these work for some of my instrument cluster, and other parts not.
B00FXWLD88|5|just what i needed
B00SHF5Z64|3|Nice looking, but the thing is it DOES NOT fit 2006 Dodge Chargers.<br />I figured I might give it a try simply because I see some of these posted for &#34;2005 - 2014 Dodge Chargers&#34; (The charger was brought back in 06') so I thought it might of been a mistake, and it was simply a year off, and wouldn't of made a huge difference. Turns out I was wrong, the 06' chargers are threaded, these are screw type. I love the way this looked, but am not willing to superglue it to my car. Has decent weight to it and feels great, just didn't fit my car sadly. Also kind of pricey for a piece of plastic in my opinion.
B00SZ71HDY|4|If you have a Quad Cab 1500 you should select &#34;extended&#34;. There was no Quad Cab size selection when I ordered and the wrong part was shipped. Customer service was very helpful in resolving this issue. Learn from me and call if you are not sure about sizing. Theses boards look great! The only thing keeping it from a five-star review is the rear mounting bracket (bottom hole) is cut too close to the bracket brace. The bolt, washer and locking washers could not seat. I had to grind room for the bolt. Be aware, new front mud flaps may not fight correctly once the boards are in installed. This not a product defect but just a fact. There may be mud flaps design to match respective running boards but I got mine to fit with minor modification.
B00WVJR0D8|1|This product did not work on my 2014 Indian Chieftain.  If I had continued the back-and-forth with OPT7 it may have worked, but I am frustrated and giving up so we will never know.  I will be returning the product as faulty/inoperative.<br /><br />This product did not work out of the box, and came with a disclaimer that it may not.  The unit worked fine on high beam, but flickered and blew the fault circuit on low beam.  The installation instructions state this might happen, and included instructions to E-mail support to have another part &#34;rushed&#34; to you.  Putting aside annoyance that the product is not shipped with all the parts needed to function correctly, I followed the instructions _to the letter_ to request the missing part.  I received a response the next day from &#34;Steven&#34; asking me for my order number, which I provided within minutes.  Later that day I received acknowledgment from &#34;Justin&#34; that my order number had been received and that the part should fix my problem.<br /><br />5 days later I wrote OPT7 asking for an update, as I had received nothing.  Later in the day I received a confusing response from &#34;Kristen&#34; that seemed to acknowledge that the product does not work correctly with bulb-out warnings.  This is not the issue I was having... the issue I have is that the unit was not shipped with all the parts needed, and 5 days had passed with nothing being shipped to me.  Kristen then blamed the failure to ship out the parts that should have been included in the kit on a failure of my messages to &#34;merge properly&#34;.

B00FH8P1DG|5|I have it on a boat and it works great.
B0089LOCGU|4|Excellent product, good price.
B000MM2Q4E|4|Works just as manufactured.  Easy to install and does EXACTLY what it was supposed to do.  Thanks so much.  I used it on the back of my camper for a bike carrier.
B0093NAAY6|5|great product, very easy install, was disappointed with shipping placed order on Monday did not show up on tracking until Friday as shipped.
B0024NSLJ8|5|Just as described, a great product-- easy to install, and looks exactly as the OEM lights. Bulb was sealed completely, not gaps for water to leak in as others had said-- also a snit to install-- about 25 minutes for both of them. I'm over 70 and do know one end of a screwdriver from the other, but that's about the extent of my mechanical knowledge. You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B005NLQAHS|5|I have used this reader on 3 different vehicles so far. I absolutely love it. It does all the same things, and more, that the  $170 OBDII reader my friend bought will do. I would buy this again in a minute.
B009KTDSH4|5|Great mask! I wear it on my 650 ninja when I don't wanna wear a helment. Yes it had a chemical smell to it but if you do any kind of riding you get use to it or you can wash it before use. I went about 100mph and stayed in place with no problems. I wear it over my prescription raybans. It is velcro and may one day need new velcro but great for now. Got to my place quickly in a few days.
B00LQIG216|5|Nice! Much easier to read than the chrome with black lettering.
B00NH92LOO|4|It just what it appears to be, little mini badges for an acura
B004A2GOK4|5|Direct replacement for 6.7 diesel F250. Great product at a great price.
B0023VDWUY|5|Good job
B0010Z4MDK|5|Arrived earlier than expected.  Great packaging and excellent price.  Installation was simple and<br />was only a fraction of the cost the alarm company charged to replace the battery.  A real winner!
B000E2CVIS|5|K & N, need i say more? easy to use and install! motorcycle hasnt imploded yet to im assuming that a good sign!
B003U2O6YQ|5|great part.
B00757O8SQ|5|Exact color, worked like a charm! My car is a lease so I have to make sure its in great condition when I return it otherwise I will get charged.
B00PV7K0FC|5|Exactly what I expected!  Holds up well outside.  Deep enough that the cigar won't roll out.  I love the modern design.
B0074ZL832|5|I replaced my original grips that came with the bike on my 07 Suzuki GSXR 750. The grips feel great &amp; look great. A bit of a struggle to get on but take your time. Although the instruction don't say to do it I placed them in a pot of water and dish soap heated to almost bowling point for 10 min. That helped them slide on.
B00BM9JHVG|5|Wish i had got them when I first got my car, not particularly pretty and difficult to get on but really nice to rest your arm on and they don't get hot when car has been parked for a while so you can use the arm rest as soon as you are in the car.
B000TYL7KY|5|You will need the right adapter for your vehicle
B00YBFW6L6|5|Just what we needed to replace the factory one on our Motorhome.
B00519THPO|5|awesome
B0009IQXFO|5|Another great product from Meguiar's, cleans and shines very well.
B001FAO8I4|3|Gauge doesnt work so I have to use a seperate gauge but it serves its purpose
B00DMTTSIQ|5|fit perfect
B000CQDQOO|5|Very easy to install. Don't over-tighten screws. I installed these on a 2000 Chevy Tracker in addition to a 1997 front end to make the 4x4 reliable. The factory air actuated system is flawed.
B00BPHOC6A|5|Fit so good on my gmc 3500 work van! Quick fast install and looks badass ... So nice that they got stolen the very next day. But will order a set again. But defianlty made my van look nice! Great for the price cant tell there not steel
B000GOG3ME|4|As advertised and on time .
B00K72C1T4|5|Quick ship!  Great product.
B00NTOJU28|4|I ordered these for my interior dome lights on my 2012 GMC Denali.  One was defective and didn't work and the return window had expired.  However, because they're so bright and work really well, I ordered a couple more.  They work really well for reading things at night (not while driving) like a map or something.<br />As we get older we need more light to see stuff and these really helped.
B004I15N6I|5|perfect fit and great shipping
B008G22G1A|5|great product , great price, I had to swap out the metal clips from the old unit because the screw threads are a different size, I popped them off with a screwdriver. It comes with new light bulbs, but I brought Phillips Xtreme Vision bulbs which are much, much brighter them OEM.
B00397WE0A|5|Excellent Product.
B00Z7KIZPA|2|I am not sure if i ordered the wrong size because the pouch size for a purse is extremely small not like pictured. The directions say that if your bag is too big for the pouch area you are to wedge the bag between the two front seats and use the Purse Pouch to support your bag from falling backward. this works for backward motion but not for a short stop or forward motion - my purse goes flying forward! the purse pouch now makes and ok garbage collector :(
B008JHJJLM|5|Great product, and the best costumer service! Really recommend yankee fans to get themselves one of these
B00BQLZ3T0|5|Great Value
B00HRB3YPS|5|Great product to help prevent warping and fading of brakes.
B0009I5WM4|5|Easy to install, easy to locate the connector on my 2000 Isuzu Trooper.  Instructions are very good on how to connect and install. After hook up all my trailer lights worked perfectly.  They could have put a few more black zip ties in to secure the wiring to the frame and received.
B00UHDTORA|5|Excellent quality, fast shipping.  These worked perfectly on my Altima engine rebuild.  TY
B00802GIW4|4|The product was pretty easy to install and looks very nice.  My only problem was the packaging of the product inside the case.  Looks like someone just threw it in there and one of the bulb didn't have a foam sleeve around it.
B00IZ2CXPU|5|Great plugs for a great price.
B0000AXU02|4|Works
B00C43BNIO|5|We have been issuing this oil for 15+years and our Yamaha 200 motor loves it!
B001GC2LVM|5|These are AWESOME!  Great at fine tuning the level of your camper.  I used it to partially lift a flat tire on a recent camper caravan.  The Trailer Aid tire changing ramp is much more fitted for this, but this worked to get the tire up just enough.
B007GRERZO|5|I bought a King Tourpak that originally came on a pre 2009 dresser.  I had to put on another mount in order for it to fit my 2011 Road Glide Custom (FLTRX).  I had to drill new holes in the bottom of the pack, but there were already holes pre-drilled in the metal plate inside.  This made it an easy modification.  It seem sturdy and very well built.
B004J0VCL8|5|My item came to me quickly and it fir perfectly with my vehicle. Super easy to install.
B000C7XVES|5|Solved the problem where the pop-up headlights would go up but not retract. The switch on the column can fail in a manner where both the column switch & the dash pop-up/down switch will not retract the headlights. After troubleshooting the circuit it was determined that the switch on the column was at fault. The new switch fits perfect & is of good quality.
B0022XFS1Y|5|Easy to install, what a difference!
B0046KIABG|4|Light works , worth the money , just strap on and go . If mounting this light the mounting straps are little long but easily fixed with a few ties to keep from flopping around
B0076PKB4M|3|Wish they were brighter
B009XOTRBM|5|Product works as it should. I caution those who are planning to put on an RV bumper. I installed on the fully welded bumper of my RV and within 25 miles the welds were starting to pull apart. Make sure you have a heavy duty bumper you are attaching this to if you are putting any weight on it, even such as a bike rack.
B000GTU686|5|Very easy to use.
B004IARLL4|5|good quality, direct fit
B00LNOULN8|5|It was easy to assemble and quick to put on. It has held very well so far
B000C2Y3SQ|5|Just what I needed, for a 78 ford 351m
B000CQFWNM|5|does the job perfectly quite in-expensive and easy to install
B005CLMEHE|5|Perfect time!!!
B000Q0PG9E|5|The way the factory should have built it!
B00ONDM07G|5|we love it works great... I phone 5 or i hone 6 plus works side ways.. love the mount it works for our go pro too
B00J42YPFG|5|Excellent service and great price! If your looking at these for to keep you warm, no go. Really light weight material. I bought them for summer riding. Works great to keep bug suicides off your jeans.
B00YMTG69E|5|Fit and worked same as factory switch.
B00ON83CLE|5|So nice
B00E7WEFQ2|4|These are so darn cute, but they don't stay stuck on very well.  We'll figure it out though.  It's worth the effort.
B000B68V6I|4|Don't use this one for your boat. Get marine stabilizer
B000ARPVQ6|5|received quickly. Great product!
B0002UEOLO|4|I never open yet but it arrives as expected
B00NWRL9EO|1|The product is not real chrome. It arrived scratched.
B00L849CYW|1|Very pool quality. Does not fit perfect. I guess you get what you pay for
B003BZLTME|4|Good quality. Double sided tape left a lot to be desired. Fixed that with zip ties.
B0051UPBGM|5|Used along side header wrap, .... this resolved my issue which really gave me the option to pass the exhaust pipe through an area otherwise impossible. Thanks !
B00BT1GUNK|5|Great guys! Had a little issue installing (it's a pain!) but these guys were there to help me and I got it! Now my lock FINALLY works!
B0004ELKC4|5|Works as advertised.
B00EP3PY6S|5|Was very pleased with product.  It looks great and installation was easy.  Saved me a lot over the local accessories shop.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Bought this after receiving a sample during a car show and wow! Hands down the best cleaner I have ever used.  It is most successful if you apply and wait a few minutes for the chemical to react (turns red/purple) get a wheel brush and loosen up all the dirt and brake dust and lastly pressure wash it clean.
B008P0HYA6|4|This cargo cover is easy to install and works well to cover items in the back of the vehicle. It is very sensitive and snaps back sometimes but it's not a terrible inconvenience.
B00MGTS1WW|5|Love it!  Holds a<br />Lot of stuff.  Well made!  Easy to use!
B00GSAUHB8|4|When I first received it, I thought it was too big for my BMW 3 series but once I put it on the coverage was perfect. I wish it was easier to fold but otherwise it's perfect.
B000C9WLBA|1|Canister is slightly smaller than the filter cap wrench that fits this size filter
B007HQ6E6E|5|Perfect
B0057B6X1W|5|Good quality. Fits like OE.
B00B0Z1BFC|5|Perfect, direct fit replacement.
B00PJK9MQY|1|Was not a good item they don't work an I wasn't going to wast my time sending them back they wasn't expensive  lessen learned
B001DEPOLC|1|I had this product for 2 weeks. It looks really nice and some friends were considering buying it as well. As we stood talking, someone walked by me and accidentally bumped it. It fell to the ground as I was left holding the handle. Very cheap/poor construction. Needless to say my friends are no longer interested in purchasing this product. Save your money.
B00MQ5Z5F2|2|I initially liked this item.  Great for the wife to keep her out of trouble.  I charged it up and jump started by lawn mower at the beginning of the season when the battery was low.  The other day my 1984 Porsche 911 would not start.  I took this out and connected it up.  The engine turned over but the engine did not start.  I ran the starter for about 10 seconds.  I looked in the engine compartment and the micro start had blown apart.  The battery had swollen inside and broke the plastic box open.<br />This was basically un-used to this point.  $120 to start the lawn mower once.  Not economical.  The thing is trash now.
B00BPC073C|5|Worked great
B000ABB1P2|5|WORKS GOOD!
B0002L6ATC|5|Liked it very much!  Rolls up easy!
B003OXUPOQ|5|This is my 4th Fumoto I have bought and I love them. Makes it much easier to change the oil, just turn the valve and it drains, turn it back and your done.<br />Using this on my F150 that I bought with a slightly stripped drain plug. Plug does not leak at all, don't have to worry about it stripping further.
B00M12BATK|5|Love the blade and towel.  Quickly removes water from uneven areas of our RV and other veehicles.  The towel really does a great job catching any remaining water.
B00RW4MCDA|5|This was great product. Easy to use. Would buy again.
B000EDUUG2|5|great for space saving lasted a long time
B008USEP0U|5|Great and easy to install.
B000COCQPG|4|it was the right part
B004A69VSM|1|Supposed to fit my Altima 2011. Way too thick! What a waste of my time.
B00MTILNA2|5|thank you
B00VE399TK|5|Great product easy to install. Would buy again
B007T7TPE4|5|Work as advertised....easy to install....highly recommend
B008SEM724|1|easy install, decent amount of light output. First rainfall lights filled with water. I siliconed the outside where the lens met the housing prior to install per suggestions from reviewers, still didn't work. garbage product
B008032QBA|5|Fit right. Working as need
B00C4XFMO0|5|Ice cold AC after recharge
B00FW1VFAG|5|love it works great, highly recomend.
B00ARJR1PQ|5|These are great plug wires!<br />The ends are firm and secure (unlike some pre-assembled sets), the boots are of the highest quality silicone.<br />I put them on a boat with a small block Chevy motor and there was a problem with the custom set fitting my application.  The company responded immediately and within two days, I had the wires I needed and was back on the water.<br />Excellent product and excellent customer service from both Amazon and API Electronics!
B00K75UFWQ|5|I received this car cover today for my 2014 Toyota Avalon. I purchased the XL which matched the measurements of my car and was recommended to fit Avalon sedan.  I immediately opened the box and was instantly impressed with the packaging and the quality of the cover.  My car was just washed yesterday, so I went outside to test size on vehicle.  Seriously, I placed it on vehicle within 5 to 7 minutes. I was able to put cover on by myself and I'm a 68 year old female, so anyone can easily handle this cover. The cover has a sewn tag attached that marks the front. I began at front of vehicle and got the cover fully tucked around the grill then easily worked it around the entire vehicle. It fits exactly like the photo. The size fits like it's custom made for my Avalon. My vehicle is parked under a large carport. Car gets dusty and extra dirty especially when the lawn men come and blow debris around. My primary need is protection from dust and dirt. I have not yet attempted to anchor the cover to vehicle so don't know if that's going to be difficult for me. I do want to anchor especially on high windy days. Honestly, I thought when I placed the order that it might be one of those &#34;quick return no fit items.&#34;  I'm pleasantly surprised and so far absolutely love the cover. After extended use I will update this review.
B0086I9YL4|5|OKAY
B00DWKYNCG|5|The best replacement bulbs I ever bought great color fast shipping I will all ways order from OPT7 !!!
B00GYI1X3A|5|OKAY
B00B0QWXW6|5|easy to install, and very clean looking on the car!
B00CO6OLFS|5|Excelente!!
B00IYHS41I|5|works great, wife can no see out windshield as the visor does not shield her/
B004P1WNBE|1|Was excited to finally have some storage space that was secure. This does not fit if your seats tumble forward to make it easier to get in the back seats. The seat hardware interferes with where the box would sit. Don't know if this was made clear in the product details page.
B007V2DJV2|5|Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my new windshield cover!  NO light comes through the sides of this when I have it on, it fits PERFECTLY! I laugh everytime I walk by a car with that shiny aluminum foil looking cover that is all saggy and just looking sad on their windshield, : )  This is easy to put on, and easy to take off, best investment yet.  Thank you!
B00867HUMK|5|good quality.
B00DMOD8NC|2|Ehh decent kit, didn't last very long before it burned out on me...
B004AIJ0W2|1|Junk, had to replace in a year because it wouldn't hold pressure. Buy OEM
B004ZF4MW8|5|These lights worked better than I had hoped. After taking out the cheapo conversion previous owner had installed in my car, these seem to work exceptionally well.<br /><br />I am a post-production artist and have to deal with subtle color correction all of the time, not only are these a very pure white (I ordered white, obviously) with no visible tint after warming up, they are very bright. I am happy with these slim units on my 2012 Subaru Impreza, they look sharp.
B000C2S6MK|5|Quality water pump at an excellent price.  Steel impeller, nothing cheap here.  Easily as robust as the OEM Honda unit, and I expect it to last as long or longer.  Includes rubber gasket.  Used it to replace an OEM pump (which was still good) when I had the engine torn down to replace the head gaskets.  Previous owner had not opted to replace the OEM pump at the last timing belt change (@ 105k miles), but I figured since the van has 135k now, and for $35 or so, why take the chance on the old one lasting another 105k miles till the next timing belt service...?  Have taken the van ('04 Odyssey) on two cross country trips so far and have accumulated 10k miles since changing it and zero issues so far.  Glad I spent the money for the peace of mind.
B0018066HM|4|fits as expected
B000N9VIH2|5|part fit perfectly,and worked perfect
B004GCNXUM|5|The mirror worked good for my needs. However it seems like it should have come with a center bolt but it did not. No installation instructions either. I ended up finding a bowl that would work. The mechanical function does work well however.....
B00DSVMCRC|5|Super high quality vest at a great price!
B0077R38TE|5|My car is so happy now that it has a flamingo!
B00VU6TXCY|5|Perfect fit, great quality, great price, I'm a very happy customer!
B001O07VI4|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B002UTQDM8|5|I own three other trailer covers. This one's a little more durable and it's easy to put on and take off. The straps are conveniently placed and keeps standard weather and debris from touching the trailer. Simple to use, great for the price.
B00K6BRC9U|1|I bought this in jan 2015 never used it once . When it was used for the first time about a week ago it broke
B009KVGIXS|3|All the bulbs were cracked and burned out instantly, had to ship back to get refund.  Other than that, easy communication and did refund.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Easy to install & works as described.  It's very convenient to just pop the handle and let the tailgate open/lower itself.
B000COBK8A|5|Great replacement horns. Easy to install and LOUD.
B00G620ZVU|5|Very good Product!
B00KETDFYA|5|I will only buy NGK for my Toyota's and Nissans great company and great plugs!
B00MJ3AZYW|5|Came on time and appears to be perfect as expected from molar , well prepared for shipping with good insulation not a nick on it, thank you
B000C9VWQU|5|Used to replace the burned up connectors on my brother's 01 Venture for the rear lights.  GM used way too small gauge for these lights and it gets way too hot and burns up the plastic, causing a bad ground.  I also ran a 12 gauge wiring to the frame near the lights to help prevent this.
B006N94D4G|5|Perfect fit!!  Very heavy and solid.
B007CTQKVU|5|Works great
B0002U1TX0|1|Just purchased a 2016 Mazda.  Dark Gray. Metallic.  I purchased all new cleaning, waxing and polishing supplies.  After speaking with the tech at auto parts store, he recommended Mother's Brazilian Carnauba Wax.<br />Went home and thoroughly cleaned the car.  Wiped it down twice to make sure no water was on the surface.<br />I then proceeded to apply / buff the wax.  Everything was going well until I brushed up against my dark gray plastic trim.  I quickly attempted to wipe off the wax but to no avail.  It seemed the harder I wiped to remove the wax the worse it got.  In the end my dark gray plastic trim looks ruined with white blemishes.  I should have read the fine print closer.  Just didn't think in this day and age that someone would make a product that couldn't be used on most of the exterior parts.<br />But then I learned that Mother's actually makes a product that help to remove the wax.  Wow purchase one product and don't worry if it mars your trim.  Just come back and spend some more money with us and we'll give you the magic potion.  It's called great business marketing - reverse 2 for 1 -  1 sucker buying both of their products.<br /><br />After all that work and frustration I plan to switch to something that provides better quality shine results, without the possibility of marring other exterior parts or requiring me to purchase another product to fix the mistakes of the first product.<br /><br />t
B000NW8ES0|5|this part was the best one i could have ever wanted , it is well built easy to install and cut my gas useage . I  now get around 18 to 20 miles a gallon  up from 13 on another off brand pump 1999 chevy blazer 4/4
B004ZZVQ54|5|Bought these to compliment the Whiteline sway bar i bought. I love their products! Superior quality! My Legacy Gt feels amazing!
B008S8W3QA|3|Not quite as good as expected. Actually returned it for a different style.
B00D7JKKOW|5|These lights are amazing.  Inexpensive, lots of light emitted, and easy to install. Get this product!
B004P5W66M|5|good deal
B00SID3TCW|3|shift pattern needs to be bolder.
B000C9HFBQ|5|It's just the front drum NOT the back plate , it's good product just wish the description explained ONLY the front drum NOT front and back drum plate
B00CNA2BV6|5|Finally got time to use towel. Very impressed with absorbency and water capacity. Easy to use than a regular chamois and leaves no beads or streaks on second pass. Have always used towel as final touch but it was unnecessary with this product.
B003N27636|5|Works as advertised
B003110THE|5|This filter is almost identical to the stock filter only with a thicker seal. The construction and materials of this filter are of high quality and the fit was excellent. The price of this filter is also incredible, at $14.19 plus free shipping, you can't beat that! Other filters for the same model are $50 & up, or on some websites no longer available! This filter is for a 1992 Kawasaki ZX-11 C3, but check Hiflofiltro's website for model application details, air filter part #11013-1188.
B00GHDIBLE|4|Good product
B00VTWJN9W|5|This was an excellent purchase with the best service ever! This was one of the few places that had this! You won't be disappointed ....
B00KHD5MIU|5|fitted well on my AMG bumper
B0001EXPBG|3|Not a bad item but the quality leaves a something to be desired.  the plastic is a bit flimsy especially for the 79.00 price  Contact mounting tape is not of the best quality could be better  the bottom lip that attaches to the lower window molding does not adhere to the molding. Had to use short self tapping black screws to secure the lower edge to the lower rubber windows molding.  As mentioned already the extended Ventshade does block the OEM mirrors. Thankfully I had changed the mirrors to the Silverado style mirrors for boat trailer towing. The extra long arms allow the clearance of the mirror blockage area.  Update:  Allows window to be partially 2/3rds opened in the rain full opening only shifts the rain splash further back in the completely open window. Outer edge should be recurved to direct water away from the open window.
B00BQN5OX8|5|Fast and easy, works great
B00NBN1C78|5|We have both a 15 foot Lund and 15 foot Crestliner (one is for fishing, one is for waterfowl hunting) and this &#34;Jack in the Box&#34; system bolts on and fits the tongue of both trailers well. It's a handy way to store and a jack and wrench, so that even if you're switching out vehicles to tow a boat, the equipment to change a tire is always still with the boat trailer. It reminds of of the steel tool boxes you can get  mounted into the back of pickup trucks, only this is a little one and it's mounted to the tongue of trailers.<br /><br /> We have both this Jack in the Box system as well as a spare tire mount designed for trailers, bolted onto our Crestliner's trailer right now during fishing season. So should we run into a flat going to or from the lake or river, we have everything we need on hand. Won't have to leave the boat and trailer on the side of the road and go get everything (which we have had to do, long ago). And because it's easy to connect and disconnect, next month for the start of waterfowl season, both the tire mount and this Jack in the Box system will be switched out from the Crestliner trailer to the Lund trailer.<br /><br />While this is meant for boat trailers and not for large RVs and such, it would work well on small utility trailers, snowmobile trailers, ATV trailers, jet-ski trailers, etc. Just check the size of the tongue of the trailer to make sure it will bolt on, or else you lose the convenience of the trailer mounting system.
B000AUMM1A|5|Felt the retrofit I built for my car was missing something and these were the finishing touch.
B00G620ZVU|5|These are one of the brightest LEDs i've put on my motorcycle, and i've tried quite a few.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone.
B00U1OA2EY|3|Wires were cut a bit and were showing near the back of the ford symbol. Had to buy some liquid tape to fix the issue other than that it was a good item
B002UC8LZW|4|Price was competitive,quality good after silicone,tape and shrink tube for waterproofing. Works great!
B00KOHHLTW|5|Great tuner. I have V&H short shots and Screaming eagle heavy breather air cleaner on my 2015 HD forty-eight. I had a cobra Powrpro Fi2000 auto tuner on the bike and I still had decel pop and slight hesitation just off idle when taking off. Put the V&H fuelpak on and it got rid off all that. Best investment on the bike!
B000FRV6NS|5|fit and run well
B00940BR8G|1|Purchased the battery 60 days ago for additional  power for the Replay XD mini I purchased at the same time. I tried the camera first but only had a use for the battery 60 days later since its function was for in car taping of race tracking events which only occur 3 times per summer. So I charged  the unit. Would not charge, support  stated to hold down power button while plugging into wall and hard pre charging for 2 hours and start again. Unit seems to charge and cycle but after trying to turn on the unit no light. Hard charged over night same thing. Solid blue light while charging indicating fully charged, cycles once in a while stating its fully charge, but once disconnected, will not turn on. Support wanted my invoice and address and would send me a RMA. So now I have to pay for shipping,on a product that never worked in the first place.The warranty is only 180 days from purchase !. Moral of the story try out your units as soon as you purchase them. Despite the issue with the extended battery pack the Replay XD mini recorded well with quality in the car. So do I RMA or just buy another power pack at $ 45.00. Disappointed with the battery .
B001Y8NF90|4|these worked great for wind on the beach but the small rivet fell out of the strap that stops the clip from sliding down.  it still works as designed.
B000JZDJTK|5|great clamp
B007Q9VCGO|5|Good Stuff
B000OC3Q2I|5|Great price
B000S2PISE|5|excellent
B008BLKI2U|3|Colour problem
B000CR3UXA|2|These were supposed to fit 1960 corvette/chevy dual headlight. the glass tabs on the back don't line up with the headlight bucket/holders. only 2/3 fit. so it sit's cockeyed in my car.
B00PT18QAQ|5|excellent product<br />only adder i would like to see is a dimple to release pressure at the valve stem when you overinflate
B00XDAB0DK|5|This Trunk Organizer is one of the best things ever for your car. I have so many things always flying around my back seats and trunk and now they are all in one place and organized. I had umbrella's, reusable grocery bags, bottles of water, first aid kit and more. Now they are all in my organizer and my car is so much cleaner.<br /><br />This also works great after a small trip to the grocery store. Nothing is more frustrating then putting bags of your groceries in your car, only to get home and find some of them rolling around the back of your car because the bags fell over and groceries fell out. Now I can set the bags in my organizer.<br /><br />The size is nice and large measuring at approx. 23&#34; x 14&#34; x 12 1/2&#34;. Folds down flat if you don't want it open all the time too. There is a mesh pocket on the side too for bottles and such. The quality is awesome. It's nice and sturdy and very well made. There are plastic hooks to hook it closed and you can also just have 1 side open if you don't need it as large. Definitely loving this and very happy with it.<br />**I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

B000WJ9M8A|5|Fits and works
B00VSB80E8|5|These do a good job at protecting our kids from harmful UV rays while in the car.  I have tried them in our Subaru Legacy, and also our Ford Windstar Van.  They work very well in both vehicles.  The shades come in a small round zippered bag, and include 4 suction cups for each shade.  The suction cups are decent quality, and stuck to the window the first try, and the shades so far have not fallen off the window.  If you are going to remove them for any reason, they can be tricky to get back into the zippered bag.  I have found that the easiest way is to grab opposite corners, and twist them towards each other near the center of the shade.  This is a nice patriotic print, and comes with a lifetime warranty so how can you go wrong.  My kids have been very happy in the back seat, since the sun is no longer in their eyes at times.  Happy kids equals a happy parent.  DISCLOSURE: A sample was provided at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased opinion.
B00HYJYE70|5|THE PRICE WAS FANTASTIC. THEY SELL AROUND HERE FOR $5 A FOR 1 BULB. THANK YOU
B000I45Y8Q|5|Great Thank you.
B00PADDFDG|4|Was great. I wish I would have had a couple brackets but it's awesome for the money.
B00EDFM5QU|5|Replaced all of the incandescent bulbs in my camper with these!  Great light and great color.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Delivered as expected and worked fine.
B00N9O0NHY|5|perfect in racing radiator honda civic
B0036R6IT6|5|Very pleased, looks great we have not taken it out on a run yet but we did a sit test and feels great.  Storage space is nice, I use it for my first aid/survival box, ponchos, I dont store my helmets in there so not sure if they fit, some say it does not hold 2 adult helmets. So as long as you use it for storage of other things you will be happy.  I had to take the rack off to mount this so you must have some basic knowledge of doing this. I am pleased
B0012Q4IRW|5|Great Spark Plug, deserve every money!
B00EDFM6R8|3|Not as bright as I would like and one light did not work at all
B00LJ3C64K|5|A must-have if you like your chrome wheels looking their best.
B006X8BATI|5|Looks great! Screws and captive nuts that came with the grill were difficult to put in. I used zip ties and you can't tell. Much easier.....
B007R9ZZ02|4|great helmet for the price but the padding for the top of the head is to thin
B00GMY77IG|2|Nice but little blurry towards bottom of shield..can't clear it..
B003884156|5|Fit perfect
B004GDIRCK|5|A year and a half later and still going strong! These are made of a cheaper plastic and are not as strong as the factory handles, but they are a very good and inexpensive alternative. The key is to make sure that you adjust the linkage so that the latch opens as the handle reaches its maximum travel. That seemed to work the best for me, your mileage may vary.
B00XO05DS2|5|The levers work exactly what i wanted i was told they didn't fit my bike by the dealer but imma get a second opinion
B00EC2CCZ8|3|they don't release very well
B009W89EAI|5|Bolted right up , quick n easy install
B001AWU6KQ|5|easy on. very strong. looks OEM.
B003X6FUU8|5|Installation took about 3 hours for me always great to have a buddy to help a little tricky taking the stock manifold out of the passenger side but just take your time sounds great already had my exhaust done with carven exhaust these gave that extra mean sound and nice rumble at stop<br />10-24-15<br />Headers still holding up well just the donut gasket completely crumbled and destroyed itself went to go buy a felpro gasket for a couple bucks much better material might even replace the actual manifold gaskets<br />11-19-2017<br />Headers are still doing great the gaskets that came with the headers were trash I had to replace them I decided to throw the original ones back on and they sealed nicely no exhaust leaks
B002NDDN3S|5|Smells awesome!!!!👍😁
B00WXQQBTI|5|Just what I needed, but I wish it came in smaller numbers...8 to a package was an overkill, but the price was right; I ended up giving the leftovers to a tire place.
B00XXLZ5T4|4|These towels really work well detailing the car and much better than those from The Rag Company. Very soft and NO shiny streaks left on surface like others. 5 star if they were a bit thicker as they are pretty thin. Best towel so far I have found for perfectionists.
B00029XGNM|5|nice tone ,very loud ,works great on my motorcycle.
B000BGM240|5|Perfect.fits camper perfect.very quick shipping
B0097YH972|5|Perfect
B005XV0YNY|5|Replacement 100% original, fast shipping, highly recommend
B00I50B970|5|Fits great, I am happy
B002IV4ZW8|5|It's the lock I like best on my trailer....
B00077ZDWQ|5|Great product, did exactly what I needed to do :-)
B0000AXNJS|3|Like the product for silver coated type things, but doesnt work on hard water spots on brushed nickel.
B008VFAKLK|5|Good magnetic signs for a good price.  FOR SALE is very visible, and the white are has plenty of space to write in a bold marker.  Even though they were folded, they do not have a heavy crease when you put them on your car.  But, they should be shipped flat.
B000I1W8JW|5|Hard to find locally Amazon had it, you need to ALSO get the LONG bar, this set up gives you more leverage that a typical lug wrench you need on the heavy duty lugs on trucks and RVs, with the bar removable it stows away well in my RV
B006B2YI6S|5|Fits very well, does exactly what it needs to, sturdy and folds up compact. Only complaint is that for the amount of money paid, it should come with a case or cover so it doesn't unfold as I grab it to put it up (I have a single cab and store it behind my seats as I'm driving, so I don't necessarily have a good grip every time I pull it up).
B004GCKRB0|5|Perfect fit, easy to install!
B003DKT2J4|5|Every thing good
B004EQ8882|5|Looks great on the front of my 2007 F-150.
B008WXL0UQ|5|I love seeing it on my car and easy to apply. I put it on my trunk door, not on the window. I'll see how it holds up!
B002UGYMDS|5|Tough
B002SE1G9U|4|Fitment was really good. the material could be a little better though, has a brownish tint to it. But overall pretty good and worth the money.
B00EKW1NEG|5|I bought it to put on my wall and the way some reviews talked, I thought it was going to be really small, which I would've been ok with, but I was pleasantly suprised when it was almost normal sized. So excited to put it on my wall.
B003SYOJX4|5|Very Satified with your products.The<br />headlamps and parking lamp len were<br />perfect,and easy to install.Even the adj.<br />were almost the correct adjustment.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Great
B0031GVBFS|5|Worked as described.
B00FQQ75ZG|5|Fit pretty good. It's easy to put on just make sure and measure your windshield to get it even
B00HTP8N0I|5|Perfect for tying down 2 Vespa Scooters inside an enclosed trailer.  Delivery was fast and product meets all expectations.
B00029WYEY|5|I prefer the aerosol version of KN kit because you get better coverage with less waste snd mess
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Can't wait to see how it works.
B007AL4W4M|5|This worked perfectly - literally plug and play - in my 2012 Toyota Tundra Double Cab SR5 TRD, which did not have the multi-information display in the instrument cluster in below the speedometer. Apparantly the truck was already pre wired, and I could see the unlit display items when I aimed a flashlight at the Temperature/ Time display on the upper dash.   I noticed the unused plug when removing the front dash panel, researched it, ordered it through Amazon from Oremorautogroup because they are in CA instead of far-away (for me!) FL, and  had it in my mailbox 48 hours later. Total install time: 1 minute. 5 stars!
B00VKNU1PU|5|Installed easily and works great
B00008RW9V|5|A must have...not just for the car but all around the house.
B000I66JEM|5|This is much better than a magnetic key box that anyone can get to. I travel over 80,000 miles a year and this was just what I needed.
B00BOMVM32|5|Product are exceptional, would recommend someone to buy.
B006WEFFP8|5|I installed this programmer in my 2011 Avalanche and I immediately noticed an increase in horsepower and fuel efficiency. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a 5.3L that's looking to get more out of it than what it comes with from the factory.
B00MWH72IW|5|Bought this for a car I bought while visiting friends...a Buick Century Ltd...I wasn't certain of the size to begin with until I saw the fit on a Dodge Challenger and then I knew it would be perfect...and it was...<br /><br />  The quality of this cover is first class for the money and so far it's been waterproof as stated...The elasticated front and rear is useful and keeps it attached to the car...but having the extra holes either side to tie down is a boon just to make sure in high winds...so far so good...I would say that pushing in the wing mirrors will help gain those few extra inches also..So if your looking for a car cover which won't break the bank..look no further..Highly recomended..Cheers
B001AJH1HK|4|This product seems to work well on my tow vehicle.  It takes a little care to fit on the vehicle mirror correctly, but once installed it is doing the job well.  Every clip on system has some kind of drawback - this one really doesn't allow the regular mirrors to be set and can render their use as marginal.  You must be extra careful until you get some experience as objects may be closer than they appear in the mirror.  That said, this is a good solution for me.  Happy RVing.
B00MAO9UO6|5|Fit Perfectly on my 2013 etec 90
B00EDFM6R8|5|Love these bulbs.  Great quality of light, easy to install.  Best upgrade you can do.
B000NJ97C0|4|The hangers stay on the rod in our travel trailer.  Adding the non-slip covers keeps everything in place.
B00TOVZP9C|2|I had to do a new custom throttle cable because of the internal dimensions of this one it did not fit my 89 warrior
B00H47FKL6|5|Really exceeded my expectations, Couldn't ask for more .
B004W5SGBO|4|It held my battery snugly and securely.  Bam.  4 stars.  I'm easy.
B00TQ0UQ18|3|Disappointed at the price. This item only has a hook. Should come with a buckle to detach Syu least
B0009JKGHE|2|Everybody leaves great reviews so I might've gotten a bad bottle but mine left an oily uneven layer on all hard plastic and chrome-like surfaces of my car interior. It's very hard to get rid of a and to get the original shine restored. It did make leather look newer tho
B004UBCKYY|5|Very fine point I can grip my finger prints. Made in some place called USA? Handy and very easy to find when you need them. I bought four of them.
B000JWOPIC|5|I've put these in the last several vehicles I've owned. It's always neat to see how much metal dust it collects when I change the oil. It will collect a little bit of dark gray looking metallic grease on the magnet u wipe clean before reinstalling. I have used in gas & diesels. It works like an extra little oil filter. Made in USA of stainless steel, nice.
B00Z7KIZPA|1|I would not recommend this item, it only would fit a clutch purse anything bigger forget about it!! I returned this item but would buy another one if it was bigger
B000FP1QT4|5|works exactly as advertised, drilled one hole and installed in seconds.  Took longer to read the instructions than install.
B00EECM5FI|5|The product works fine, delivery on time.<br />Very satisfied.Happy to endorse this company.
B000CMDCKQ|5|Very durable and excellent addition with the anti-vibaration device.
B00G6188EM|5|Just what my son wanted, perfect!!
B00P710OAS|5|Nicer than I thought they would be.<br />The tweed is good quality.
B00Z9O31A8|5|Very well made
B00BSKYM82|1|I wanted to put this on my motorcycle saddlebags (fiberglass) because they get scuffed up when mounting the bike.  I practiced on a spare part I had, and thought I knew what I was doing.  When I put it on the saddlebag, it had an orange peel look, which was horrible.  As I added more coats, it did not change, and there were bubbles in the finish.  The finishes scratches and scuffs the same (worse) than paint, so it was not going to be a good solution.  So I have to remove it, and it is impossible to remove.  I have tried heat, and scrubbing all to no avail.  I am going to take paint remover to it and have my saddlebags repainted.  Way too hard too use and remove.  Not a consumer do it yourself product by any means.  Really glad I did not put it on my car.  Follow up note:  I did find that Isopropyl alcohol will remove the shield.  It is 8 hours of work to get it off my saddle bags, about 4 sq ft worth.
B000C496OK|5|Works as advertised.
B0077S1BBU|5|Fit great in my 2005 accord i4
B004HRO59Y|5|Shipped quickly. Wired up and worked with no issues.
B00MBFAXMC|4|I bought these for my 2009 Scion TC. I placed them on the windows and it gave the car a cooler look. The stickers look very nice and stick fairly well. I would not try to put them on the interior because they don't stick very well onto plastic material. They are a little bit reflective but for the price, it is a good product!
B007TG7ILC|5|These fit my 2013 Silverado perfectly.  Install was extremely easy and the brand is one of the best.  The price on Amazon was much better than what I could get locally.
B00480J4KA|5|Saved a ton of money by purchasing these for my 2008 Altima.  The color is ever so slightly off, but you can't tell during normal driving.  I only see it when my headlights are reflecting off of the wall in my garage.  Definitely worth the money and I will buy again the next time I have to replace my headlights.
B0027VT0I8|5|Worked right out of the box as advertized
B007KTINWQ|5|So easy to apply, and leaves a glossy super slippery coat that lasts. Applied my first coat weeks ago and still feels slippery though its covered in dust now. Bought it because its top rated by consumer reports, and glad i did.
B008RUFTJ2|2|The glue gun did not work at all
B00M4U5AM2|5|Perfect fit for 2007 corolla at a fraction of what the mechanics charge
B003EOXKRY|5|as expected. oes the job well
B003YLH942|5|Perfect fit just what I needed
B0068ERO1A|5|Fits and kept me dry on a recent motorcycle trip
B00HU3ENOY|4|fit perfectly.  took 10min to install alone.  looks good.  protects the hood edge just fine.  works OK as a bug screen for the bottom 1/3 - 1/2 of windshield.  not so much for the upper half
B0017KIZSQ|2|Bracket is shaped well. Wrong bolts sent. Not even 8 of the same type of fasteners. 7 of the 8 were the same length as stock minus the extended unthreaded portion. It took me a while to install so not sure I can return it.
B00YTTFY4A|2|Half of the lights are out. Every bulb has  five  out of 16 .... If you have any questions you can  call me at 732-904-4559
B005C5DT5G|5|Good product.
B004LGW9N0|5|Great replacement radiator for my 2007 Ram 5.7 Hemi 4x4.  Nearly perfect in every way.  I really couldn’t see any major differences between this one and my original (Except my original had a big hole in it!)  Only time will tell how long it will last, but so far I’ve got about 1000 miles on it with no issues.  Very pleased.
B000OCFIAQ|5|Usa made very robust should make light work out of u joint replacement
B007AF9RCK|5|Easy application
B00B9EVUR8|5|The product was good material, good quality, great shipping.
B00JH24Y9A|5|definitely battery acid all over the box and everything,besides that it works like it's supposed too.
B007TD1WIK|5|I bought these battery booster to have in my trunk just in case I would ever need to jump a car. These cables did it's job when I needed it. Simple and easy to use cables. The length of the cables was just enough to reach the other car battery. Overall, the cables worked.
B00KTJ1PLU|5|good
B001NYYSLY|5|Really moves the air. Nice quiet fan.
B00JXCIRX8|5|I assumed this would come by FedEx or UPS, but got a call from a trucking company that it was on the way.  Luckily I could redirect the driver to a place where he could get his semi turned around because it wouldn't have happened in my driveway.  The steps look good and were mounted in under 20 minutes.<br />I did call the manufacture because I thought one side was missing part of the mounting tab.  A live person answered the phone and was very helpful. He explained that it was built correctly, and if I had a diesel truck it would be obvious as to why the one tab is different.<br />The bed access step has a little give to it because of the leverage being applied.  Each side is bolted to the truck with five or six bolts total but in three locations, all under the cab.  It would definitely be stronger if you could bolt it to the bed also, but I'll bet theres a good reason they make it like they do.<br />These steps function very well and look good.  Several random people have commented on them and said they'd like to have a set for their truck also.
B00K53DSZ6|5|Battery arrived on time and fully charged. It's an exact fit for my Genuine Scooter Buddy 125  and starts it right up even if it has been sitting for several weeks.
B000MW91RE|5|Great value and it got the job done, will definitely buy this sandpaper on amazon again as I saved money over the auto parts stores.
B00UBNGAI2|5|The only spray I trust on my cars!!! Keeps it silky smooth and smells great
B00L4NHW7Q|5|Just as described!
B00BYH6C1E|5|This is a very good buy. Although it is a bit pricey, the extra two stuff (small flashlight and stickypad) are nice additions. I was a bit hesitant to get it at first because of reviews saying that it slid out when moving the seat but it barely does that with my car (Honda Accord). When it does move, it moves about half an inch and is easily put back into place with a slight push. Regardless of that, you will not have this problem if you would not be moving your seats and even if you did, it does its job very well and I never have to go digging into the abyss that is the space between the seat and console which makes it completely worth it. Great buy and I highly recommend. Thank you.
B00EQ26FPW|1|Very cheaply made smh at least remove the excess prices of plastic so the metal sticker can sit flush..
B0077HE8PM|5|Very satisfied with product.The east of installation.  Would recommend this product and this company to anyone.
B002WSJMPW|3|There may have been a unpublished manufactures change involving my Audi and this part. I have the exact vehicle that this part is guaranteed to fit. A 2004 Audi A4 Quattro. The holes for the two bolts that connect the pressure lines in and out are too small, I elected not to change hardware as the correct part was readily available when I was doing the work. Other than tha[[ASIN:B002WSJMPW ACM W0133-1785663-ACM Air Conditioning Receiver Drier]]t it appears identical to the one in the vehicle.
B009IK6N5O|5|Excellent fit. Look very good in my camaro!!  Thank
B002GTKAHQ|3|Didn't fit my after market bars which are the same as stock so I Jimmy rigged some stoppers from the old bar ends, otherwise pleased.
B00RM327NG|4|Works well.  The long magnetic that was provided for inside the phone with the battery occasionally slides and  messes with my sound.  I don't use the sticker magnet for the outside of my phone case bc I switch cases often.Other than that,  it gets the job done. I'm pleased.
B0092JLDIS|5|Great replacement for my 2001 Tribute
B002SIR8RU|4|Great Product
B000MK5M7E|4|The mounting instructions were a bit confusing, but once installed, worked as it was supposed to.  We have only used it once, but it does seem like it is made of quality materials.
B00U23D7S2|5|Perfect.
B00E9B0JF2|5|I liked that the seller let me choose my own color. Responded promptly. Looks as described.
B00SZK2C7Q|5|couldnt be happier!
B007SR2DZS|5|Gauge looked great and worked great! Never had any issues!
B012LPLZYQ|5|Hard and real sharp ears.  Will hurt some folks if it is used.
B008B5WVF8|5|Works great
B000AMLWH8|5|good job for me
B005J1UL0E|5|Perfect for our 5th wheel.Telling friends about it.  Will order again from this company...
B00XYXPWL2|5|Great sticker. Just tired of the uncultured swines thinking its the Illuminati
B000VL590O|5|The repair works, the colors are a little harder to mix than the instruction makes it sound, but the glue works
B0085XH58O|5|I love it
B00MB0EXGE|3|Cute but fades after couple of weeks.
B001EHSUVE|5|Good, does not have the smelling problem for me.
B000276B2C|5|Fram makes the best oil filters you can buy. You could buy more expensive filters but they don't work any better.
B00J7XYZXE|1|Buy the better led bulbs.... This vendor included many incorrectly sized bulbs,  and about 6 were missing. This was a waste of time, and these are going back.
B000UOFJTS|5|Well made and perfect fit!
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Nice bag!
