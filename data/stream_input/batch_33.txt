B004ZJZQCE|4|I've never understood why The Jackal has been cursed with poor reviews from pretty much everybody. From the day I saw it as a 17-year-old in January 1998 I always found it entertaining and exciting. This might be down to the fact that I have never seen the 1973 original.<br /><br />Brucie plays a nameless assassin, cool as ice and utterly emotionless. Richard Gere is the only man to have seen him. He's let out of prison to assist the FBI in catching the Jackal before he takes out an uncertain high-ranking official. Willis and Gere are, for the most part, leading their own movies as they never meet until the climax. It's very interesting watching them both go about their business, Willis hatching a master plan and Gere methodically picking apart his trail and hunting him down. There is great support from Sidney Poitier and cutie-pie Diane Venora as a scarred Russian cop.<br /><br />With a wide variety of brilliantly photographed locations across the US and Canada, and plot with a medium-level of complexity it's not entirely brainless viewing but not too taxing as to alienate lazy viewers. I honestly do not get why so many people hate it. Willis has done far worse films (even seen Mercury Rising?) that get off scot-free somehow, but The Jackal doesn't get off so lightly. Aside from Gere's slightly dodgy Oirish accent I have no complaints about this film. Give it a chance and you might just be entertained.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a nice-looking 2.40:1 1080p picture with DTS HD-MA sound. None of the extras from the DVD have been ported over.
B002KDUDG6|5|\\"Crazy Love\\" - Is absolutely Wonderful, Michael Buble' has a voice that will make you \\"Melt\\"!  This CD is Wonderful, don't believe those reviews that give it a bad write up, it's amazing!!!  I highly recommend it and if you are not a \\"Fan\\" of his yet, you will be after this CD!
B006MW3UZW|4|So wonderfully done! This season wasn't quite as good as the first, but it kept up well enough to keep me coming back for more...
067443000X|4|Good reference book. Solution to problem probably would not sell. Author gives ample data which is impressive and should be useful in the futere
B001TODCII|1|Do not buy this movie if you do not like violence, and sinceless killing.  I thought it would be enjoyable to watch until violence become the whole movie.
B00001P4RI|5|I was first sent a copy of this wonderous music when I was dating a man whom I deeply love. I knew nothing of Brendan Perry's solo/musical career and when I decided to finally place the tape in and listen to these  blissful/poignant melodies I was brought to tears. Brendan has a mystical  and outwordly voice which silently screams of wisdom and maturity. This  album is for anyone that feels and craves lyrics of wisdom. The melodies  are haunting and memorable. You will have this CD taunt you and you will  not rest until you purchase it. Believe me this is absolutely worth it!
B00PEJG1K0|4|Not as good as some of the earlier albums by Manson but great compared to the last 2. I just love the dark sound of this one where he seems to have gone back closer to what  made Mobscene so good.
B00BAXFJ5M|4|Good story line, page turner.  Anything David Baldacci writes is always a good read.  I like the characters he puts some depth to them.
B004HO6I4M|3|LOVE this movie. When I received it the cover said something about it being a rental, it was weird. I was expecting the cover to say \\"Rio the movie\\" like it shows on the pictures of display ...
B00DHRLK84|4|This review relates primarily to your decision to buy the 3d version or not. As loudly as I can, do not waste your money on 3d and simply savor the regular blu ray version.  Sadly, the 3d version adds nothing.  This is an incredible movie, no doubt, but the 3d really doesn't even deserve the name. The only difference between the regular and the 3d is that you have to wear the annoying glasses to watch the 3d version. Definitely rush to buy this movie, just learn from my mistake and content yourself with blu ray.
B000002AH1|5|Typically Miles Davies with that electric band feel !!
B00B0LPWU6|3|I like the movie, but Denzel Washington's acting always seems to be the same.  His character never changes from movie to movie if you get what I mean.
B00CWY76CC|5|I usually find free games boring or cheaply made, but this has nice graphics and was a fun challenge. I can't wait for more rooms!

0062082353|3|Every so often I like to read biographies. Chris Kyle's account of being a prolific sniper during four tours in Iraq is the story of his personal development as a Navy SEAL, a husband and father, and a person. While the descriptions were for the most part gripping, I had a hard time reconciling the author's claims of being a devout Christian with his chest-thumping expressions of pride each time he felled another insurgent with a single shot. He describes his love of fighting, whether bar fights, hazing of other new recruits, or carrying out his duties in the war zone. When he comes home again, he's still getting into bar fights, defending waitresses, and so on. Ultimately I was left with the feeling that this was more a case of arrested development than development.
0525952926|5|enjoyed readinf of second generation. great character development.  waiting on book three. i would recommend book two but book one should be read first.
B00BD99JMW|5|Great story beginning to end told by both Tris and Four's point of view...
1455121924|5|I will never eat wheat again!<br />This book was only ten dollars, but it was worth a whole lot more.<br />Just when you think he's given you a plate full of meat and potatoes,<br />wham, he hits you with another fact that blows your hair back.<br />Then you think you've gotten way more than your moneys worth,<br />and wham, he hits you with another fact that blows your mind.<br />He just keeps building more facts and evidence.<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite books.<br />I want all my family and loved ones to read it.
B00526ZKYS|4|I enjoyed the book Delirium.  I especially enjoyed that it was delivered wirelessly to my Kindle  and I was able to begin enjoying it right away.  The book is a good read.
1582701709|5|Love this book! It really made me a better more positive thing person! definitely I would gift it to others and I recommend it for anyone!
B000002HH2|3|I enjoy the music on this CD.  Bjrk does some amazing and outrageous things with her voice, once again.  IT's OH SO QUIET, a 1940's tune by Hanslang-Reisfeld, is a roller coaster of big band sound -- at once quiet then explosive.  Bjrk displays interesting and unique perspective in her lyrics.  HYPER-BALLAD is a complex statement of relationships.  We live on a mountain / right at the top / there's a beautiful view / from the top of the mountain / every morning I walk towards the edge / and throw little things off / like / car-parts, bottles and cutlery / or whatever I find lying around / it's become a habit / a way / to start the day / I go through all this / before you wake up / so I can feel happier / to be safe up here with you /   Not your standard girl-meets-boy pop sentiment.  THE MODERN THINGS contains a perceptive insight on the role of gadgets.  I am intriqued and challenged by the music on this CD.  If you are interested in songs sung well which are extremely unique, this CD will interest you.
B00IHMEAYK|4|Several times while reading this one I completely forgot I was reading Murakami. Very different from most of his other novels.  The character of Tsukuru Tazaki  is well-developed, though a little slow at the start (as Tsukuru himself was awi little slow/late at self-awareness) .  And his pilgrimage is completely an internal, introspective one.  No action, historical drama, intrigue or supernatural phenomena here, as in much of Murakami's work.
B000I8G5B2|5|beautiful film & cinematography, excellent execution, solid performances, the story is captivating and keeps you glued to the screen, must watch!
B004I654WQ|5|The animation was wonderful, but the story made this movie great. It looks wonderful on Blu-ray and we used the DVD to watch in the car on our way to Disney's Cars Land (totally based on this movie) at Disney's California Adventure.
B000RG1FMO|4|Well the question of whether this album was going to be better than Curtis was answered a long time ago, so I think enough time has passed to look back on it and assess it as it is; Kanye West's third studio album.  To start off, the artwork is one of the best I've ever seen on a hip hop album, and it'll catch your eye every time.  As far as the music goes, I think it could have been much better had the original version of \\"Homecoming\\" been used.  I still don't quite understand Chris Martin singing the chorus of a love song about Chicago, but who am I to question the marketing machine that is Mr. West.  I think \\"Home\\" with John Legend is a far better song and was disappointed not to see it here.  And speaking of that, where is \\"Bittersweet\\" with John Mayer???  Some of Kanye's best lyrics ever and in my opinion a far better song than \\"Big Brother\\" which should have been a b-side or a bonus track somewhere, as I believe \\"Bittersweet\\" became.  Other than that, you know most of these songs already b/c he's released about 5 or 6 singles from this record.  If you like those pick it up, if you're just starting out I'd suggest starting with College Dropout and than Late Registration (my personal favorite West album).  3 1/2 stars.
B0064X7FVE|5|I use this app all the time.  It's accurate and reliable.  I love how there are different things, like hourly vs next 10 days and it has the pollen counts on it.  I love it!!

B00881VLCE|5|I have always played jigsaw puzzles ever since my mom bought my first one when I was 5 and I've loved them ever since. I love these puzzles as they have beautiful colors and you can make them as easy or as hard as you want to . I'm addicted!!!
B007VDN1PA|1|It didn't work
B0088X7YU0|5|I was absolutely stunned by this Movie!  I m a fan of the First Movie, which was damn good! However, the Starship Troopers franchise lost me with the (two) crappy sequels. Movies 2 and 3 were terrible! But this one...Movie 4.  Wow! Stunning Animation, great script, ...a great (save) for the franchise. I HIGHLY recommend to the franchise to contract the writers and producers of this Animation sequel to also create 5, 6,  7, etc.  This Movie was so great I had to see it again and again, (3) times in a row, over a 3 day period. You have to be a(gamer)to appreciate the video CG Animation, and also be a fan of the very First Starship troopers Movie to truly understand and appreciate this latest installment. I think this movie saved this franchise, and gave it new life. So let's do a Number(5)in full CG animation and see where all goes. Buy this Movie NOW!!!  Its money well spent ...Buy it on Blue Ray only!
B004ASK9J0|5|Beautifull movie. :-) I really love this film. in spanish: es una hermosa película, realmente la amo, espero verla muchas veces más.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I have been using this to help me in math homework. It shows great results. It will even let you look at problems you did before. You really need to get this.
0062059882|2|Interesting concept, nice style of writing but it starts slow, very, very slowly.  Sure it picked up speed a while through but overall I still didn't love it. I simply didn't care about what happend to Shadow, Laura or Odin - none the characters weren't truly developed, nor did I feel that many of the plots were.  I had expected a truly brilliant ending for all those 'empty' pages but it never came.<br /><br />I think I need to stop reading highly recommended books.  My expectations are too high...
B00E9ZATKI|5|Can't wait to share this with my kids.
B004DI7HZ6|4|I loved the intellectual and historical spin the author put on the trilogy.  Made for very interesting reading.
0316067938|5|Breaking Dawn is the engrossing final chapter of the story of Bella Schwan and her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen. In this story, Edward and Bella take their relationship to a committing level and enter the world of marriage. The two couldn't be more in love as they take their honeymoon on a secluded island where, by no planning at all, Bella finds out she is pregnant with a half vampire-half human baby and becomes very ill. Saving Bella is everyone's main concern, even if it means sacrificing the life of the child she bares. But there is a way, the only way, for both of them to survive. As if this doesn't create enough for the character's to deal with, there comes some unforseen danger that threatens everyone in the story.<br /><br />Stephanie Meyer's Twilight Saga has been a life changing series for me, especially Breaking Dawn. Before Breaking Dawn, my husband and I together loved to go and see the Twilight movies because he is more into movies then he is books. The movies had him hooked, and he and I both couldn't wait to find out what happens to the characters Bella, Edward, Jacob, Charlie, the Cullens', and Jacob's family so we listened to the audio book together. The experience of listening to the audiobook together, instead of plopped down in front of the t.v., brought us closer than we have been in our 7 years of marriage. But even without my husband in the picture, the story Breaking Dawn always kept me wanting more with it's excitment and danger around every corner. The author is a genius in keeping the audience engrossed in caring about all the characters, even the not so nice ones.<br /><br />The only critique I would have for Mrs. Meyer's on this amazing tale of vampire and warewolves, would be the ending. I understand the author's goal would probably have been to let the audience decide what happens to Edward and Bella and their new life together after all that was said and done,even the rest of the characters, Jacob and Nessie, the Cullens'. I felt the very end left too many questions unanswered and not enough information to let us imagaine where the final ending went. I felt there was enough left unsaid that there could end up being a 5th book in this series, but who knows, maybe that was the point!eft too many questions unanswered and not enough information to let us imagaine where the final ending went. I felt there was enough left unsaid that there could end up being a 5th book in this series, but who knows, maybe that was the point!
B00G2GMRCU|5|One of my favorites so far. I like the short stories as i do not have time to read the novels regularly.
B000003S0P|5|. When this album came out it was a staple of my friends and myself. I lost touch with it for 25 years, loved it in my head but did not play it. I have recently gotten reaquainted with it and it still holds it's incredible power. We all thought it sounded like the devil's badass music. I still believe it was and is amazingly structured but wonderfully free improv. My drum hero will always be Bruford.
B00R3DODWI|5|If this is your type of movie you'll love it.
B0041KVZ1I|5|Classic album
0451169514|5|IT is an excellent thriller.  Children, bonded in that they are outcasts, form a group of believers that can perceive absolute evil.  Don't read it in bed, because when you fall asleep you will be afraid that Pennywise will creep into your soul and torment it nice and slow.  Don't look around, don't turn around, Pennywise will know!
B00J2PCCYQ|5|This movie is beyond what everyone takes it up to be. I definitely see why it's chart-topping across the world!
B00HBQWGXK|5|Captivating and suspenseful the entire time.<br />Would recommend thAt you take the time out to enjoy this and others by Lee Child.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I fell in love with the characters, like I was part of their love story. I laughed and cried and got angry and happy and sad. This book is phenomenal!! The best I have read in a long long time, maybe even forever.
B000KJTCOG|4|satisfied ... but the jewel case was badly broken
B009C7JS14|5|and can find my area...a definite plus! We have a hard time getting things to find us way out here..this did! :)
B005I6EVUG|4|I got this cover when I got my K.F.....What can i say... I love it ....it looks great ,it is nice and slim and feels good in my hands.
B00AL6SM0S|4|fine performances all around, but none top the performances I already had. For instance, as Isolde, Nilsson is far better than Flagstad; both had fantastic voices; Nilsson added passion. And the Bodansky cuts are deplorable
B000069AUI|3|I could listen to Parachutes (chill out music) beginning to end but I havent even been able to do that with &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. I usually just get bored and change the CD after the first five songs. Its not an awful album, just not enough to hold my attention for long.
B008PUXMP2|5|Love this set.  It's a nice overview of Amy's singing, without being encyclopedic or overwhelming.  We'll enjoy it for a long time.
B003ZJ70W4|5|I love this show on TV and in the movie threatres and now on DVD or Blue-Ray.  I like the story line, when I want to drift away from my boring everyday stuff.
0385537131|5|I fell in love with John Grisham with his first novel, &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.  I loved &#34;The Client&#34; and &#34;The Pelican Brief&#34;.  I struggled though some others and thought my love affair with Grisham novels had ended.  That was until I read Sycamore Row.  If Hollywood doesn't make this one into a movie they're missing the boat.  Absolutely loved it!
B0086700CM|5|I first heard about this from a couple of  classmates and some friends I was almost sure I would hate it but once I actually started playing it. now I am sooooooooo addicted its insane I probably play like 50 times a day. I would totally recommend this game.
B009NFHF0Q|4|I loved this book.  It held me captive -- I couldn't wait to read more every day.  I love books that take me to unknown, mystical places.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Prepare some tissues my friends! Its a sad romance you will love! Its funny, too! Thanks John Green! Love, Meeeee
B004U52VPS|4|I know the game was great because the kids ALREADY HAD IT!!!!  You know what would be great?  If somehow, Amazon could link together families just to monitor the purchases.  Like, the parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, etc....could go to this page on Amazon ...maybe call it the Family Purchases, or whatever, and register there under one family.  Then, if you should go to purchase something on Amazon and it has already been purchased, a red flag comes up saying, &#34;Another family member has already purchased this item.  Do you wish to continue?&#34;  Then, you might save some returns, etc.  Just an idea.
B00992CF6W|5|you must get the game .evan know it is $7 its awesome you can get updates and get armor and new bricks
0517642913|5|The format is perfect, the hardbound covers and gilded edges look nice. There is nothing more I could want from this book.
0312117337|1|I purchased this as an expansion of my collection after hearing such good reviews about it.  However, after opening it the cards have English titles but the book is in French.  No fair.  Waste of money.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Shah y2k hmm gm co chi biO as few requirements go :-P dad's hop Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa nO hI dad's b.s. I few/ in Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ess no
B007HC3LHS|5|Loved the book. At first I didn't get the back and forth chapters, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5|I was not going to read this book... the hype was too much and I just didn't want to read it. I thought that it couldn't really be that good, as good as everyone is saying....<br /><br />Then, once the movie came out, I secretly downloaded the book and began reading it. I think I read this book faster than any other book I have ever picked up. Wow! This was awesome. Seeing the growth and depth in the characters, the action and adventure... this book had it all. Thank you Ms. Collins for bringing this amazing book to us!
B0095JQYCU|4|PENTATONIX IS AN EXCEPTIONAL GROUP OF FIVE SINGERS WHO ARE A VERY MODERN VERSION OF WHERE ACAPELLA SINGING IS GOING IN THE NEW AGE.  LISTEN AND YOU WILL BELIEVE.
B00RL9UZGW|5|Denzel has yet to let me down. Class act!!
B007HC3LHS|5|This was a book that held your attention thoughout the whole book and could see how these things could happen. Good writer as he went back and forth to explain the past and how it effected the future.It was hard to put down.
B0045TYDNC|5|Works great!
0156012197|5|Apparently written for children, The Little Prince is packed with wisdom about love and life.  I first came across it in college French class and now I make sure all my family and good friends have a copy.
1401322425|4|I bought this book from a large-scale book store for full price (doh!) only a few days ago, and I'm eager to cook many of these recipes.  The directions are concise and clear, the photos are gorgeous, and the meals themselves seems like a dream come true.  The book even includes educational tidbits on meat cuts, asparagus nutrients, etc.  The only reason I give this cookbook 4 out of 5 stars is because the recipes aren't all that practical for every-day cooking, especially at every-day salaries.  I'll have to spend five times the money (time aside) to make homemade french onion soup instead of buying some in a jar, and my favorite recipe in this book (guinness, beef, and cheese pie) will require 3 hours and 15 minutes of oven time alone.  I would say this recipe book is much more usable than the NYT cookbook, which I find to be a little pretentious, but not as easy to implement as the Moosewood cookbook.  However, this one has amazing non-vegetarian dishes in it.  I'm definitely going to impress my boyfriend with this stuff.
B007TNS6JI|4|So I had this for a while and it was great but after a while I uninstallednit about anyear later I reinstaled it and it was a a lot different right now I'm level 16 but my person looks weird he is full of armour but his helmet never appears but it is a good game
0143034901|4|Very well written, great description of Barcelona and fantastic mystery! In the end is difficult to stop reading it fo a minute!
B00004XPP0|1|I love the Star Wars movies, and I have seen them more than a couple times, as I'm sure everyone else has. But this is outrageous. I see no need for ANOTHER repackaging and redistribution of the same Star Wars movies. I could see if it included Star Wars: Episode One, but it doesn't. It does have a featurette on the making of Episode II, but there is nothing else new here. So if you already own them, don't bother. If you do not already own these classic works of Science Fiction, and can't wait for them to come out on DVD, buy this set now, but only under those conditions.
B000W1V44I|5|I love this CD.  It's been a long wait since Never Gone, but finally I have it and can't get enough of it.  Great work Guys, you made it worth waiting for.
B00HBQWGXK|2|Not his best  by any stretch.
B008D28HYS|5|a fun game
B00HR6RE4K|4|Having a symphony background, I especially love the orchestra music on the cds.  My favorite from the Twilight movie, Bella's Lullaby, seemed incomplete.  All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.
B00CO4GO7I|5|As a retired vet of both Vietnam and Iraq I really enjoyed this book. Now I can enjoy the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5|When I started reflected in you I never imagined how much better it would be from the first one. This book exceeded my expectations! I cannot get enough of the heart gripping moments Sylvia brings us to in the journey of Eva and Gideon! Not sure how we can wait for book 3! Great job onceagain
B00BD99JMW|1|Ending of the book is extremely disappointing. The entire point of the first two books was that suffering will eventually lead to peace and forgiveness but instead the third book completely contradicts the first two by going way off track and proving that war and selfishness are the true identities of humanity. It proves that good does not win out and people always end up broken. If this were reality I'm sure 5 years later you would find out Four commits suicide. What a fopaux for Veronica Roth!
B00II399HG|3|Definitely a story worth telling. The movie and acting was fair. Not a great movie but certainly a good one with some memorable moments.
B00BQRXNKA|5|Beautiful, powerful, emotional!
B004QZ9PLU|5|dawson cole showed so much character and strenth the ending (i didn't see it coming) A truely amazing romance and thoughtful presentation by Nicholas Sparks

B00000DGUY|4|Counting their live albums, Dire Straits has only 8 albums, and they could probably fit on 4 albums, five at the most, to make a great box set. Dire Straits is an excellent and very talented group, and I bet their box set would sell. As for their greatest hits, it is missing many songs, and the editing is BS, but for a casual fan who has heard Sultans of Swing, Money for Nothing, So Far Away, and Walk of Life on the radio and knows nothing else, this is a good start. It just leaves them wanting more, like a BOX SET!
B007J4T2G8|1|Besides being horribly written, this book should not be included in the public library book list. A more appropriate place for it would be the adult book store.
0975991477|3|I enjoyed reading Bruce Lipton's \\"The Biology of Belief,\\" because it has a lot of thought-provoking and useful information about how belief affects our cells. However, I had a had time wading through the almost constant first-person narrative Dr. Lipton uses to describe each insight, idea, or moment of understanding he has experienced. The book is too focused on the author's personal journey; while I'm happy that Lipton came to his insights and experienced life change, the reason for reading the book is that I want to apply what the author has learned, to change my own life.  The inspiration of Lipton's narrative should have served the information he offers to the reader, rather than being a distraction.<br /><br />The message of the book, once you get past what seems to be a large ego, is really important and valid for readers. What we believe, the attitudes and expectations, and most of all, the environment we create in our lives, truly impacts our health and the patterns that we live by.  This principle applies to one's physical health, mental and emotional states, and spiritual health.  Joy, wisdom, and even prosperity are influenced by what we believe. So is the liver, the lungs, and the very genetic codes embedded in our cells.<br /><br />I value what Bruce Lipton has written, but would have appreciated the work much more if he had spent less time setting up each concept with long narratives about what he was doing when the \\"revelation\\" came to him.  In any book, the reader wants to be the ultimate subject, but in this book, the author is front and center.
B003ODIZL6|5|This book was really interesting but not my type.<br />And also i would reccommend it to my grandma she the best
0393061310|5|Well written and tremendously researched book of facts in the development of our society. Loved reading it.
B00BAXFECK|4|Very good - quite &#34;Russian&#34;.  The philosophy at the end is very thought-provoking.  Enjoyed it very much.  A bit long.
B0053TMP24|4|It's good I like it it makes me happy people are making me write this the book is cool 👍
B0052UZIFA|5|This game is excellent. Tons of fun and enough to keep you busy for a long time. My only complaint would be that the game doesn't save your sound settings. every time I play this game on the can I have to turn the volume off. Its a little annoying, not enough to take away a star though
B003QTSMXE|5|This is my family's favorite.
B004EPYZUI|1|This film is by far the worst film of the year. It has no plot, sloppy storytelling, lousy editing (they edit and alter the story too mantain a PG-13 rating even making the nazis have no blood), the soundtrack is like being raped (it's basicly Britney Spears covers of all theses beloved rock songs). This film gose nowere fast, it's just random inconsequential action sequences. Their is never any real peril since it's all make beleive, and they're extremley repetitive. This film relies on mindless explosions and hot chicks to get people to see it, which will satisfy most people but if your looking for an actual story this is not for you. This is basicaly Twilight for guys. The film feels like a 100 minute video game trailer, and it's unbearabley boring. With an ending that's beyond predictable.    I can't stress enough it's mindless. The special effects are great, but as Matt Stone and Trey Parker said, (special effects are not story)    You also never see what actually happend sicne 99% of the film is a make beleive pretend world. Which leaves a lot open to interpretation.    Also the subplot with her evil father never gets resolved.     Their is also the logical flaw, Since it requred Carla Gugino's signature to give a labotomy, how could labotomy's be going on in front of her that she did not sign for and she not catch on until numerous ones had bean performed.

B0055PGUYU|5|This book is very interesting and educational! I am applying the principles learned from the stories to improve the habits of my own life!  A must read!
B007R11DKQ|5|I really liked the show. My husband and 13 year old enjoyed it also. Good story, nothing too graphically scary. No bad language. We need more movies like this. Just action and fantasy.
B00CWY76CC|5|I love how the game progresses in each level. I have become a modern houdini. l just love playing it.
B005F9TQ9C|5|Have always loved all of Dylan's albums--even after he added electric guitars and various classical instruments to his work.  Now I have his works on dvd--how modern!
B009HUB40Y|4|This Is A fun match gems game that you cam play on your android tablets. It is easy and is for ages 8 to 80. Have fun game that you can play any where.Take withyou to all your appolntments.
B000MKD9P6|5|Great casting and a good story of how today's women are only truly happy when they think for themselves. Enjoy!
B00H71PBQ8|5|Fantastic show! I really love it, all of the characters and the show is really well written I am totally addicted!
B00OQWWBBE|5|Love it
B000002TQV|5|Trust me, The Bends will blow you away. Even after hearing how good OK Computer was, I wasn't prepared for the one that preceded it. The songs on 'The Bends' give you an excuse to crank your stereo up to the max. The best song on the disc is the soft 'Fake Plastic Trees.' The meaning of the song eludes me but it is truly beautiful. Other good tracks are 'The Bends' and the eerie 'Street Spirit'. Even if you didn't like OK Computer, you will love this one.
B007HACDLK|5|I have read all of Mr. Flynn's books and he continues to give me a read that I can't put down until I am finished.  I look forward to his next book!  I like all of his characters.  Clifford A. Mitts III
0345528581|5|This body looks simple, but start doing the exercises.. . I thought I was pretty strong from practicing and teaching power yoga... I recommend starting with beginners one first, my muscles are shaking, heart-rate went up and broke a sweat in under 25 mins, LOVE IT!!  Thank you, so cool not have to go to gym, I can focus way more at home!  oxox
B008133DO8|5|Rarely do I find any movie or show which compared favorably to its original source material.  This show is one of the exceptions.  In its depth and richness, it even surpasses many aspects of the original books, particularly in the depth of the characters, and the dimensions of the world, which are fleshed out here in a war Sir Doyle never attempted.
B005LAIH54|5|PART II WAS JUST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST MOVIE. I LOVE ACTION AND SUSPENSE MOVIES LIKE THIS PLUS THE ACTOR IS SUPER CUTE...SHOUT OUT TO HIM.
B0071XO8RA|5|I just finished this book.  There are many great reviews on here, but I just want to add my weight to the rating.<br /><br />This is a great (and surely new classic) science fiction story.  Ridley Scott bought the film rights:  I just hope he doesn't ruin it (Prometheus was awful!).<br /><br />Pick this one up.  You won't regret it.
B0094M4N9E|4|Keeps you laughing all the way!
B003O86FMW|5|I can't believe that this book was better than the first.  The first book was really good!  I was up until 2 a.m. reading this one because I could NOT put it down!!!
0345803485|2|I can see why some people like these kinds of books. But I need more of a plot. As soon as it got good; they were doing it again. Might give the sequel a shot but not sure.
0738702994|5|I just tore open the box and dove into this new deck and it is everything I had hoped. The artwork is luscious, the book is very, very well done and the organza bag is delightful. Can you tell I am just a little bit smitten with this deck?<br /><br />I have gone through the deck a couple of times and after this initial \\"looking over\\" I did not have any negative feelings about any of the cards. The artwork is totally mouth watering, each card is just spectacular and I am lusting for a big print of quite a few of the majors.<br /><br />The minors are more so in the RWS style and more of a watercolor with pen and ink overlay, but it works! The majors should be more lush and opulent and i can see why the artist created the deck in this way. The minors round out the majors. Any beginner could pick up this deck and learn to read with it very, very quickly. A more seasoned reader will enjoy the new tales of Welsh mythology (many of somewhat familiar) and will quickly see how the myths blend into the tarot symbolism.<br /><br />This deck is destined to capture the hearts of readers, collectors and enthusiasts alike! BIG BIG recommendation!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Once setting it up, sit down and enjoy high quality programs. The option of having your smart phone as a remote is fantastic.
B004ZMWUCU|5|I was raised catholic so, like Philomena, this book tells of the horrible interpretation the catholics have of the christian message.
B009C7ZQM4|5|I can't believe this is a free app.  It is wonderful and helped clean the garbage files off my Kindle.
B002QE3CTY|4|The concept of this story is brilliant. The first sentence introduces a mystery that drives you to turn pages all story long. The events and backstory--on a macro level--are awesome. One of the most creative concepts I've read and I read a lot.<br /><br />But the execution of these concepts was sloppy. Characters suddenly swing into rages, standing and yelling at each other. The health and fitness aspects weren't believable (some people run distances too easily and later in the story are winded by less, healing happens too quickly. The social dynamics aren't nuanced--they're pretty stereotyped. And for a long while I wasn't sure I liked the main character.<br /><br />So it's worth reading, but you'll have to be patient with immature writing. I'm hoping the author got better in the next books.
B009HUB40Y|5|This game is somewhat bejeweled game and that's why I am enjoying it so much. It is very addictive to. I haven't had any problems at all.
B00KVI76ZS|4|Well written and incredibly full of information.

0446677450|2|This is not a how-to book. <br />It has, as already mentioned by many reviewers, more of a motivational effect on its readers than an educational one. The motivational effect of the book most likely comes from Kiyosaki's salesmanship of his ideas. He writes to emotionalise, not to proove, his principles. I have found most of these tactics (like insider trading) to be illegal (thankfully not from personal experience). Following this book word for word as gospel, as a how-to-book, will get you into trouble. Jail, problems with tax authorities, the government, your family and friends, homelessness etc. I bet that Kiyosaki doesn't (/isn't naïve enough to) follow his own advice. Why am I sure that he doesn't do this? Simple; he's not in jail! <br />As an educational product, I wouldn't recommend it. Why? Most of the principles (and Kiyosaki's supposed implementation of them) are exaggerated. They are not factual, but often contradictory or self-aggrandising. And, as many people are coming to suspect, they are probably totally fictional. <br />IMHO, this is one of the most fictional books ever categorised as non-fiction. <br />For instance, he recommends one should own a corporation and write off buying a Porsche (on behalf of the corporation's owner, i.e. you) as a corporate expense. This will save you taxes. However, he does not (as all demagogues do) talk about the disadvantages of using his teachings, such as the increased suspicion of the tax authorities that audit your business and then possibly fine you severely or making you cough up the money. They will question you - Porsche or not! <br />He boasts of wealth (real millionaires don't flaunt their wealth at every opportunity) and is clearly very materialistic. He says that \\"money buys me freedom,\\" yet he is caged in his limited perception of true wealth. To underline this statement; he teaches that the reason you should have friends is to profit from them economically (like people doing insider trading for you =illegal). This is a totally mercenary attitude. I can't believe that someone who writes a best-seller harbours such limiting attitudes.<br />A lot of the book contains his and \\"Rich Dad's\\" teachings about the inferiority and weakness (= we're so great, since we're rich) of people who choose to be employees, for whom job security is a prime factor in choosing one's life path. In Cashflow Quadrant, the sequel to RDPD, he teaches that each kind of path in life has its own advantages and disadvantages. No path is better than the other; all are subjective. Clear contradiction - sadly not an exception to the rule. <br />This is a man who, supposedly following his own teachings, retired at the age of 47 and now slaves away selling his books and products. He probably works more now than he did before. Some freedom...<br />The stand that is taken towards people who aren't trying to become like the mystical Rich Dad is quite degrading. But then, Rich Dad believed in giving to charity and being generous. These are extremely amiable traits. I'm puzzled; if one is charitable and generous, then why would one act self-righteously and degrade other people?<br />Many people say \\"This book made me think about finances!\\" Doh! The tax people make you think about finances each year! Some might even quit their job because of what Kiyosaki sells them during the course of reading this book. That would be sick. Do yourself a favour and educate yourself to become a businessperson, not a Kiyosaki-cult member, before setting up shop.<br />I bought the ebook version of RDPD. I learnt how NOT to do things and how NOT to think. And then I bought Cashflow Quadrant and it reinforced what I had learned NOT to do to a great extent. However...<br />... I didn't do my homework before buying them. Now I've been taught a lesson in how to buy books about finances and wealth, I think that the twenty dollars that I spent on both ebooks was not a lot. After all, I won't be falling for this stuff in the future and will save myself a lot of unnecessary risk and wasted money. <br />I bought it because I had `heard many good things' about the book. Then I made my discovery and learnt my lesson. The lesson: <br />Study both the praise and criticism of a book before you buy it - no matter how hyped or popular it is, ALWAYS. <br />I was ignorant enough to buy it without doing my homework first. I hope that you're cleverer than I was. <br />Where should you go to find out about the science of wealth creation and success? Try the following books:<br />Think and Grow Rich<BR>The Millionaire Next Door<BR>The Millionaire Mind<BR>How to Win Friends and Influence People<BR>And any other positive, spiritual literature that will help you balance your material wealth with spiritual wealth (New Testament, Tao Te King, Baghavahd Gita etc.).<br />These books aren't badly written or edited, neither do they contain many principles which, if followed, could pose a serious risk to someone's individual freedom. In fact, the tend to liberate the open-minded reader from many limiting beliefs and attitudes<br />After all, the Master taught that the truth will set you free. Go get some. <br />Thanks for reading this review and have a great day,<br />Brian.<br />PS. Why 2 stars? Because knowing what NOT to do is also useful!
0439023521|5|My daughter loved the book.
B004FOA84A|2|This game has a few quirks where the puzzles are mechanically off.  The makers did a much better job in their 2012 jungle game.<br /><br />Overall, it's a meh game and, because o f some of the odd quirks, expect to hit up a walkthrough to get yourself through some of the clumsier puzzles.
B003162R7E|4|My collection of Hendrix is diminished so i am starting to put it back together and chose this album for the interest it generates for me.I am guessing anyone who likes what Jimi has done i believe will love this gathering. thank you.
B00BAXFECK|1|Omg finally over . This could have been written in half the pages. Way too wordy and drawn out<br /><br />  Painful together through
B008OOYALE|1|I  love this game on my iphone, but it's terrible on kindle fire. It shuts down every few seconds and won't let me visit neighbors. I'm so fed up with terrible apps that don't work on this stupid piece of garbage kindle fire!!!
B00BAXFCPO|2|Tough to get through. The science may be true but too much info for me. Just looking for the nuts and bolts.
B000F0UUT6|5|This mini-series was my introduction to Jane Austen. Seriously, I had gone my whole life not reading Jane Austen because I thought it was all girly stuff. I had no idea the political intrigue a simple courtship could produce. With all the scheming and plotting in this mini-series, it didn't feel girly at all. This book is less about love and more about humans in general.<br /><br />I love Mr. Darcy! Who knew a proud crabcake like him could be so charming!
0545586178|5|Catching Fire couldn't be written more satisfying. A great sequel to a great book. Definitely recommended for people who like distopian.
B009FZFONO|5|Love The Walking Dead! The show continues to impress with really strong characters and storyline, and surprisingly emotionally charged scenes.  Keep up the great work AMC!

B0000042MY|5|Exactly as described.  Thank you!
B000001GK9|4|This is generally regarded as the great recording of the Mahler 9th, and it is very good, beautifully played and well-recorded in concert.  It's not perfect, though.  There is a clear division between the first two movements  and the last two, which are the ones that really make this outstanding.  While the first two movements are not bad in any way, there is a sense of  detachment, as if Karajan and the musicians had not quite been absorbed  into the music.  This is especially true in the opening bars of the  symphony, which seem to make or break every performance.  There is a bit of  a rush and a feeling of inflexibility, when this part should ease into life  as naturally and spontaneously as breathing in and out.  However, once the  third movement begins the group really catches fire and bring this awesome  music to a close like no one else.  This is absolutely worth having, but if  you love the piece, you'll want another as well; Barbirolli, Walter,  Bernstein, the new Zander are several fine recordings.
B007HJ8V76|1|Disgusting
0307895475|5|I got exactly what they advertised, overall it was a great experiance and I would work with them again in the future.
B00G4U7TO0|5|LOVE IT! Great music to relax to. This album is a great gateway to folk music if you're curious but unfamiliar where to start. Always bet on T-Bone Burnett. :)
B00JJV4QZG|5|One of the best 10 books I've ever read.  Meaningful insights into life, strong character development, beautifully told story and hilarious to boot.  I laughed out loud many times and a time or two had to turn my head so my wife couldn't see the mist in my eyes.<br />I have ordered two more of this authors books after reading this one.  If they are half as good as &#34;Us&#34; it will be money well spent.
1612191290|1|Total misrepresentation. This is not a history, it's a diatribe. If you care to read about one man's opinions on economists, the International Monetary Fund, and a wild collection of topics, read on. If you're looking for an insightful and unbiased view into the history of debt, keep looking.<br /><br />The publishers should find someone to write the book they're advertising, because that I would enjoy reading.
B00HAA8URS|3|Underwhelming. I was expecting so much more. There are only three songs that I can actually listen to. I wouldn't waste you money. Buy the two songs you like on a download and move on.
1476715904|5|Love love love this series!!! One of my top favorites so far!! I would recommend it to anyone looking for just a good love story to fall in love with.
B00003CXB2|5|Lawrence of Arabia is an incredibly rich and challenging movie to watch and devour.  It has breathtaking cinematography, convincing actors, as well as a well-developed theme in story.  Filmed in some of the most exotic Middle East locations (the locations appear almost as though no one travels through them), the film is about Lawrence's effort to help the Arabs (many of whom are played by non-Arabs) obtain self-determination from the Turks.<br /><br />Although the movie is quite long -- four hours (I was unable to watch the entire movie in one sitting), it is certainly well worth watching.  You will feel as though you have gone through history, visited these incredible sites (without having to go through the pain of visiting them), and have come back with a lot of insights into human nature.  This is a high quality film.<br /><br />Michael
B00004T9UF|5|The marshall mathers LP was one of the best cds Ive ever purchased. The controversy was in fact well deserved, but Eminem is a truly good artist, to anyone who likes the rap genre.Especially, hardcore rap, even though he's now mainstream. His lyrics are dazzling, putting him right up there with many of the best rappers. The only people who dislike this album are poeple who take things too seriously or have no clue what true talent is. If you like Jay-Z,Dr dre, ja rule, nelly, Missy Elliot, scar face, D12, bubba sparxx, and other underground and mainstream rap artists eminem is a must have.
B005ZKYXZI|5|This is such a good movie. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I  was very glad that I bought it! I highly recommend this!
B001BANK32|5|Read this years ago; just as good the second time. The right balance of horror and fantasy.
B00I2TW0UO|5|Good movie, great book!
B0086700CM|3|This game is okay.  After all, it was free.  There are too many other games that are also free I'd rather play.
B004J4WKUQ|1|And that's it, really. His character is a flat line. Every other character is, too—if they seem bad, they are; if they don't, they're not. This is probably a good book for someone like Wade: self-pitying, passively misogynistic, a self-described \\"nice guy,\\" someone who needs to use pop culture references in place of personality or meaningful interaction. If that's not you, stay away.
B008EEZ64Y|4|Although I found this book fascinating and disturbing, I wanted more from the story. I know I can create the ending, but  I  wanted more  fascination. I would recommend this book for mature children, teens and adults. Good for book groups that like short reads.
B009SJ3H8Q|5|This is perfectly horrifying!
B00004TRD8|5|years passed but like this flick(except matrix)wasnt made.every scene of is splendid.i saw it over and over,still i watch this with same merriment and zest.i cant imagine a person who wont put these masterwork into best sci-fi films.
B00HCMG6LG|5|These really make me use my brain to figure them out and I love it and so will you. Great brain exercise.
B004GJDQT8|5|Speedy service!
B009UX2YAC|5|I get so hooked on this game, that I've almost missed my stop on the train many times. Love this game!!
B009OMYASS|3|This movie has been around for ages no, so on a snow day I decided to sit down and finally see what all the hype was about. Hostel is twisted, but lacks the tension necessary to draw audience in. Instead you are just an observe, safe and sound, and guaranteed a nice and tight resolution by the final scene.
0062014102|5|This is wow! I couldn't put it down. Maybe some people already read a few books about these subjects, but to me this is an eye opener. You don't have to belief all the author tell you but if you mind is open, then, please read it.
0783232039|5|The product was really good, it arrived much earlier than i was told. The disk was working and the case was not broken or anything. The only bad point was that it was a reigion 1 dvd, my player was reigian 4. But that was easily solved by playing on a different player.   Excellent value.  Thanks.
1439153663|5|I didn't want to put the book down, and yet I didn't want to finish it, as the story was so good.  The plot was somewhat similar to other basic slave books, but the character development was very good.
B008YWY0HK|5|Great, Wonderful!!  We really enjoyed it very much.  The movie was for our grandchild and we msaw it all together.  Thank you.<br />gliglu@live.com
B0086700CM|5|TEMPLE RUN ALLLLLL THE WAAAAAAAY PLAY IT EVRY DAY MY BROS HISCORE IS 19MILLION POINTS ON THE ITOUCH CANT W8 TO BEAT HIS RECORD
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|Free,this should not be free,worth well over $5!cars are great.also,graphics are great as well.love this game.I recommend this game to be played on the kindle fire HD. and/or ipad!
B008Y2FRFO|5|you will have tons of fun. plus its addictive im all ready at a level 10. I started three days ago.
B00AWTTUHI|5|Definately as good as Part 1 if not better. I am a huge Batman fan and, although I might be in the minority here, I didn't really care to much for Frank Miller Batman comics because they were hard for me to follow. After watching both movies, the comics completely make sense. Bottom line, I would recommend Parts' 1 and 2 to anyone especially if you did not like the comics. Perfect follow up to Part 1.
B00JDWJV92|5|I realize that Michael Jackson had no part in finalizing the songs and this album - but the sound, mood, feeling are spot-on... and coming from a long time MEGA fan, it's one of the best MJ albums yet. Thank you to the producers for including the original recordings!
B008Y78AO4|5|Great movie and a great ending.
B00S2T3U6C|5|Madonna is still alive and well............ lots of compilations. good ones.... too.
B006SV2LWA|4|Cute tool and handy size!
B0015AARJI|5|very good
B00BPHPYCQ|5|Being a kid of the 80s I LOVED this story. Well told story..great mix of nostalgia and sci-fi.<br />Will Wheaton knocks it out of the part on the audio book~
B004J64QSI|5|Songs are beautifully written and sung by very talented people.  It was nice to see the composers and original casts at the end.
B0090SI42Y|3|I love Rza, I really do. He is one of the best musical talents around! But he really should have learned to project, not mumble, open his mouth when he talks, or they should have put a mic right next to his mouth because I could barley understand anything he was saying! In total opposite Russell Crowe was a complete delight! I really enjoyed him in this role, funny and bad azz! I think everyone did a really good job, Rza when it came to the music but not the acting. It's just one of those really quirky movies that you'll either like or not like. Overall I liked it; it has some cool fighting scenes an even if the top billed actors sort of carried this movie, it's still really entertaining.
B00EI6E17A|5|This song is so full of energy and a good beat that it forces me to get up and dance! I can see myself listening to this song until I absolutely can't stand it anymore. (And that won't be anytime soon!)
B008ODZEQ0|5|Beautiful documentary. Maybe not the first guy you'd want to have a beer with, but it's not like he's running for president.
B00VRYCGLO|5|Fun and very challenging.
B00O3UBB1U|2|To answer the question of the title - it's a BUST!!!<br />NO Rock at all!!<br />The some old new material with no pop! Other than the &#34;pop&#34; &#34;commercial&#34; tracks they have been putting out of late.<br />Does NOT even come close to &#34;Back In Black&#34; or &#34;For Those About To Rock&#34;!
1781162646|3|I am a Stephen King fanatic so maybe Im being too harsh. It was a good story, well told, but I don't think it quite lived up to the level of  some of his previous works. I have read some of his books that kept me up at night and stayed with me for weeks. This aint that.
B00BHMF578|4|We enjoyed this movie but I think after all the hype we were a little let down.  Why does that always happen?  Anyway I enjoyed that it felt very accurate and I learned facts I had either forgotten or didn't know before.
B0002F7I9Y|4|I love Ray Charles. And while I generally believe Ray could make a commercial jungle sound great (he has!), I listened to this album feeling like there were a couple of poor musical choices that did not have to be made. Specifically, his duet with James Taylor and another with Elton John. I acknowledge these artist's contribution to music and individually I enjoy their music. However, Ray seemed to be struggling to make the songs interesting and fresh. I felt the results were mediocre at best. On the spectacular side, the CD is worth the price for the other collaborations, especially BB King, and Bonnie Raitt. Thank you for your genius Ray.
B00DR0PDNE|5|The Google Chromecast at launch, even with limited applications on day one, is a fantastic streaming device for the cost of $35.<br /><br />Today this is not the Apple TV or Roku, but after using it for a few Netflix shows, YouTube videos, and video streaming from websites in the Chrome browser I am very impressed.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who are saying this device is nothing new from what is already existing, however, aside from the form factor this device isn't aiming to be something brand new. It's a low profile and with simple cable management, can be hidden completely behind the TV.<br /><br />If you are like me and have been considering a streaming device, but couldn't settle on what to get, do yourself a favor and consider this device.<br /><br />Google already has apps in their Play Store to utilize MLB.TV, HBO Go, Hulu, etc, it's just up the developers to add Chromecast support and i don't see why they won't do that.<br /><br />Unless you are completely biased towards Apple or Roku or paranoid about Google monitoring usage there's no reason to look down on this device.<br /><br />*** UPDATE 7/26/13 ***<br /><br />Amazon wised up and made their content unavailable for Chrome casting. I don't blame them, but hope this means they are working with Google form an app rather than shut out users.<br /><br />I have connected to Skydrive to view photos and documents, works really well. Not perfect, but great way to easily show off photos to a group of people.<br /><br />Had a few issues when the nexus 7 tablet was too close to our baby monitor so I think there was some interference, moved the nexus a few feet away from the monitor and connectivity improved.<br /><br />Again, I think this is a great $35 device with a lot of potential. A lot of places are still directly comparing this to AppleTV and Roku, I think they are doing all three devices a disservice in this comparison.<br /><br />Chromecast gets five stars from me for these reasons:<br /><br />1.Small and discrete. Easy to conceal behind a larger TV, 32\\"+. USB power from TV works.<br />2. Works on multiple devices. I don't need a Google product to make it work.<br />3. It is $35. Which is fantastic.<br />4. Extremely portable, adds no weight for travel to my computer bag<br />5. Android is the mobile OS with the most users worldwide, I'm not too worried about app adoption/integration. If there is no app adoption/integration then it is $35.<br /><br />Is see the negatives as:<br /><br />1. Limited content at launch.<br /><br />I don't deduct due to content for the simple reason that it has been three days since launch, the Chromecast was a surprise announcement and not the headline product. I am confident that content apps already in the play store will adopt the feature relatively quickly and easily.

B00DHBOQMM|5|Mickey Haller rules again! I can't wait for the next thrilling instalment, but it will be very hard to beat
B006ZCWTXS|5|An album full of brilliant songs, the quality is exceptional. If you like Adele, you'll love this. Ferguson has an incredible, unique voice and a great song writing talent. Quite breathtaking in it's brilliance, this is not an album you'll wish you hadn't bought in a year, but one that will become a much lauded classic that you'll never tire of. Highly recommended.
B004GJDQT8|5|My favorite and most trusted site. 100% satisfaction
B0063IH60K|5|This game is excellent. I love solitaire, and this gives so many choices and options. As good as solitaire can get! Great free app.
B004LWZWGK|3|This is a great movie and I cannot wait to buy it.  However, this ultraviolet \\"digital copy stuff is crap\\".  I want the iTunes copy for my iPhone and iPad.<br /><br />Three stars +5 for the movie - 2 for the ultraviolet garbage therefore product gets three stars.
B00AIQP9DE|4|This is a great hidden object game.  The graphics are good and the storyline is interesting.  The hint button helps navigate you if you get stuck.  I would reccommend this game.
B000002A73|5|Let me tell ya somethin,  Roger was the talent that produced all of those Floyd albums that we all love and his solo stuff is twice as good as  Floyd's stuff without him.  Momentary Lapse Of Reason sounds like the band  Simply Red and is weak as hell when compared to Roger's solo efforts.   wtg  ol' Rog at least you haven't turned into a pathetic,   shadow of yourself  who is trying like hell to swim in the same ol' fish bowl year after year.
B00AFPVPDG|5|Got through this in less than 3 hours, but enjoyed how it synced up with my own personal process right now.  Will be using the checklists and trying to put this stuff into practice.  It's one of those books that will polarize readers into two groups.  Doers and thinkers.  Going through the reviews you will be able to easily identify one from the other, so let that help guide you in your review and decision process.  Once you can answer that for yourself, you'll be able to set your own expectations for the book.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed it, and am about to go live it.<br />Ciao.<br /><br />€
B00G0KY1UO|3|Good game
B003N0XDT4|1|It worked for about 2 months.  I sent it back to the company and never heard anything again.  Should have flushed the money.  Thanks for nothing.
B007MB5OCE|5|Full of surprises and suspense.  A story of the extraordinary life of a hundred year old man.  And sometimes it was sad and sometimes I laughed out loud, but it was a good read from beginning to end.
B000MD7OKY|5|Cary Grant is typically cool and witty.  Grace Kelly is beautiful and is always dressed amazingly. The plot is clever with twists and has clever dialogue.  This is one of my favorites!  Witty, attractive, and entertaining.
B003D0ZNM4|5|Hauntingly beautiful.  This is a new name to me; I am glad that I found this music.  Part's music is<br />creative and thought provoking.  A composer like this seems to be rare, especially in the twentieth century;<br />his style is unique and spiritual--a most welcome addition to what I have collected, and want to listen to.<br />Arvo Part's music is a must for those who desire classical music that is fresh and new.
B009ZFPQOQ|3|a little confusing at times
B003O86FMW|5|My daughter loved it. Gave up TV, etc to read it.  She can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|I enjoyed The Husbands Secret  very much.A bit hard to keep up with All the characters.<br /> Loved the couple with the Secret.
B00FRQ32N4|5|Great game with a glitch or two but way worth the trouble awesome up grades and easy control of player makes the game a class above all similar games
B000GFLKF8|5|I have to start out by saying that as an avid movie watcher I generally try to keep an open mind when approaching a movie.  With that being said there are a couple of directors that I find this to be a particularly hard task to succeed in, Quentin Tarentino is one such director and the other is Spike Lee.  I have to say that whenever either of these two critically acclaimed directors releases a movie (or a `joint' as Spike Lee prefers to label them), I find it difficult to get too excited about seeing them, and sometimes I don't end up seeing the movie at all, though I try to make an effort because you never know when one might hit you just right.  So, when I saw the trailer for the upcoming Spike Lee movie \\"Inside Man\\" starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, I was somewhat interested in it simply because I enjoy both actors' work; however, Denzel had done a Spike Lee movie before that I didn't like, so that didn't guarantee that I would enjoy him in this one.  Over time I saw more trailers for the movie and read what the film was to be about and I have to say that for the first time ever, I was actually excited to see a Spike Lee movie, but whether my anticipation was misplaced or completely justified would remain to be seen. <br /> <br />\\"Inside Man\\" presents us with the story of a brilliant criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who has devised the perfect bank robbery and subsequent escape without being caught by the law.  However, when the plan is hatched events quickly begin to spiral out of control and the police are fast on the scene led by a cunningly smart detective (Denzel Washington) who will not rest until the situation is contained.  Just when negotiations are beginning to take shape between the criminals and the police, a government power broker (Jodie Foster) interferes throwing this delicate matter into a state of uncertainty where one wrong move could spell disaster for all involved. <br /> <br />After watching this movie I quickly came to the conclusion that even though I generally dislike most Spike Lee movies, even he can surprise me sometimes.  \\"Inside Man\\" was a wonderfully constructed cat-and-mouse thriller that was completely engrossing and a genuine surprise to me, and was by far the most mainstream Spike Lee movie to date.  The story was well paced, full of twists-and-turns that you don't see coming, and the dialogue was so well-written and at times an absolute joy to listen to, especially the many exchanges between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's characters.  The acting was terrific from all actors involved, each actor was given so much to work with, which is often a rarity in an ensemble piece like this one, where there are so many A-list actors gathered in one film, generally one or two of them get shorted on development.  A lot of the fun I had in watching this movie was trying to figure out the various motives every character had or which side they were truly on, so many of the characters had hidden agendas you really didn't know what to expect from any of them, which made the experience all the more enjoyable for me. <br /> <br />As I said earlier I'm not by any means a Spike Lee fan and enjoying this movie doesn't change that fact, but for me to have been even remotely entertained by this film is a feat in and of itself.  With all that being said, I think it would be nice to see more independent-type directors, such as Spike Lee or Quentin Tarentino, make more mainstream films and maybe, just maybe, I would like their work a whole lot more than simply one movie here and there. <br /> <br />\\"Inside Man\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B005C8ENI0|5|Suspenseful, well-done plot. Unexpected plot twist make for great ending!
B008G33NFC|5|Hi ya'll Tarja fans, just wanna start off by saying I am a big Tarja fan since Tarja's beginnings with Nightwish and am still a Nightwish fan too. Got my DVD yeaterday at my local FYE store and watched Disc 1 this morning. This concert is amazing and watching Tarja perform brings back memories of her performance on the \\"End Of An Era\\" DVD. The sound and picture is perfect as you get the highest quality sound of DTS and picture perfect quality. The concert was shot perfectly as it was not made like an MTV video (camera moving everywhere, zooming in and out sporadically, ect...). So overall this is an awesome package put together. Highly recommended to everyone that loves this genre of metal!
B00N1JQ2UO|5|love it
B001O1O71C|5|This book was a great book that had left me flabbergasted and super amazing for the fact you didn't mention the gas chamber
B000059PQQ|5|I saw this movie when I was 13, many years ago and recently decided I wanted a copy so went online to find it. Amazon had the best price so I ordered it. Watching it again after all these years I still laughed at the absurdity of it! Great all star cast, great acting and filming. Shipping was fast and product was better than described and arrived in excellent condition. I have ordered online from Amazon in the past and have never been disappointed.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Nice
B00DI75SWM|4|But it's a bit.. Unnecessary.
B009ZFPQOQ|5|Practically good app!! Loved it since the first time started using it.
B000QRIGLC|5|No words can add to this book to make it any more compelling to read.  It is a story of the greatest of American Warriors as told through one of the SEAL's remarkable members!  I would like to say one of the SEAL's greatest heroes, but even in this book there are many great heroes; and we know there are many more out there keeping the peace with their stories remaining mostly untold.
B002ZG99TK|5|Enjoyable, edge of your seat, DW does an excellent job as always.  Good view-- Would purchase again.  I have watched several times and the good guys win each time.
B001AQTWF2|4|Whitney Houston's first album since 2002's [[ASIN:B00006HCUW Just Whitney]] is destined to become a hit.  It isn't because [[ASIN:B001AQTWF2 I Look to You]] is a revolutionary R&B album or Houston's strongest work, but because R&B's leading lady has finally returned after a seven-year hiatus.  And let's face it, 2002's Just Whitney didn't allure us the way that 1998's [[ASIN:B00000DFRS My Love Is Your Love]], which was a huge multi-platinum hit fueled by hit single \\"It's Not Right But It's OK\\". That album arrived after a shocking eight-year hiatus from the diva. Honestly, I Look To You turns out to be surprisingly good considering many people doubted if Whitney Houston 'still had it'.  Sure, I Look to You lacks some of the unrequited passion of Whitney's heyday, but one must remember that Whitney's last modern hit was 1998's My Love is Your Love.  I Look To You also doesn't possess a hit the likes of \\"It's Not Right, But It's OK\\", but at this point, fans are happy that one of the best R&B singers of all time has returned back to the spotlight.  'Flaws and all', I don't think anyone would deny that a purchase of Whitney Houston's comeback album would be a waste of time, money, or energy.<br /><br />The album opens up strongly with the Alicia Keys co-penned \\"Million Dollar Bill\\".  \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" benefits from sound production work with an old-school R&B feel, which was made for Houston to sing.  While it is obvious this song was written by Keys, Houston sings it extremely well and successfully exerts her own influence.  Sure, it may not be the quite the same Houston who sang the chilling \\"I Will Always Love You\\", but this Houston here still showcases a strong talent and clearly proves that drug-use, a failed marriage, and a ridiculous reality show didn't killer her prodigious vocal talents.<br /><br />\\"Nothin' But Love\\" is OK, but it is the slightest bit clunky to my ear.  I don't particularly buy the song 100% itself, but it isn't horrible by any means.  Whitney does OK with it, but I would've love to have had a slightly more energized track that may have been better tempered to Houston. The production is strong, reminiscent of numerous Whitney Houston remixes that have appeared throughout the years (\\"I'm Every Woman\\" or \\"Step By Step from [[ASIN:0793577497 The Preacher's Wife]]).  \\"Call You Tonight\\" is more well rounded and Whitney generally sounds stronger and more herself on it.  It possesses the adult-contemporary R&B sound that propelled Whitney in her heyday and even in the 1990s.  It and the exceptionally R. Kelly penned first single \\"I Look To You\\" are certainly not going to lure a new generation to Whitney Houston - particularly given the hip-hop R&B dominated market - but it should lay well at adult R&B stations.<br /><br />\\"I Look To You\\" is understated for R. Kelly, but it serves well for Whitney as it allows her to showcase her brilliant voice.  Sure, you don't get the goosebumps you got when you listened to a power-ballad like her ubiquitous \\"I Will Always Love You\\" or the touching \\"One Moment In Time\\", but \\"I Look To You\\" seems the most representative of Whitney Houston of the entire album; it features the most authenticity.<br /><br />\\"Like I Never Left\\" featuring Akon is a great concession to a more modern R&B sound, though it doesn't ever concede as it is plenty 'adult' enough in sound as it hip-enough for a younger generation.  It isn't a crossover hit by any means, but it may have the most potential to break the hip-hop barrier.  \\"A Song For You\\" is lovely, though the disco-production wasn't necessary.  It doesn't 'corrupt' the song (though many pundits will chide it), but it would've been fine if Whitney had maintained the authenticity of the original.  Either way, I personally think Houston does fine with the classic soul song.<br /><br />\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" one-ups \\"A Song For You\\", proving to be another authentic Whitney Houston performance.  One wishes more of the big ballads had beenplaced on this album as they truly showcase Houston at her best.  \\"Worth It\\" is a great contemporary R&B track, and proves to be one of the very best of I Look To You. Houston sounds fantastic here and I could truly see this making a fine single for Houston.  The production is great - among the best of the album.  \\"For The Lovers\\" proves to be another production standout.  Again placing Houston against a dance-backdrop, it falls flatter than the ballads, though it is no means bad.  However, when you consider a \\"dance-tastic\\" Houston, you think of her takes on \\"I'm Every Woman\\" or \\"Step By Step\\". Either way, \\"For The Lovers\\" is by all means enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"I Got You\\" is solid by all means and serves as a good, though not show-stealing penultimate track.  \\"I Salute\\" ends the album on a high note and proves to be one of the best tracks on I Look To You.<br /><br />I Look To You, by all means, proves to be solid.  It isn't Whitney's best nor her worst, though I would suspect that she will garner a couple of Grammy nominations.  It is, if nothing else, a good solid effort from a legendary R&B singer.  Even though \\"I Look To You\\" isn't nearly as memorable as anything from Houston's path, it shows that everyone's favorite female adult-R&B singer 'still has it'.  3.5 stars.uly showcase Houston at her best.  \\"Worth It\\" is a great contemporary R&B track, and proves to be one of the very best of I Look To You.

B001M5UDGS|5|It's the kind of music that sticks in your head and in your heart.   Funny plot, great songs and great acting...   When will there be a sequel II?
B011LBH0RC|1|It's time to wrap it up. This band has certainly run it's course. They've turned into something more akin to a Bruce Springsteen tribute act than an actual rock band. The songwriters Jon's been using the past ten years are nothing but pop writers. The only thing keeping any semblance of rock in the band was Ritchie. Not only is he gone now, but his writing has been pushed away further and further with each release. The band is done. Jon has lost the magic. I understand bands need to grow, and add to their sound, so they don't become stale, but that can certainly be done with good taste, and done without robbing the sound that so many people loved for so many years. See Def Leppard.<br />This album itself is nothing more than a handful of leftover tracks that weren't good enough to make albums from Bounce through The Circle. And what a way to close the door. Throw out the rest of the trash. It even comes in what resembles a paper garbage bag.<br />I'll break it all down like this, if you liked BJ's first 6 or 7 albums, and maybe though Crush was a nice comeback, but have been waiting since then for the next These Days or Keep the Faith, you'll be sorely disappointed with this collection.<br />As for me, I'm done waiting. I gave them enough chances to release another album full of songs that I can at least call good. But I see now I've been waiting in vain. It went from a handful of good songs on Crush, to a few good songs on Bounce and Have a Nice Day, to a couple good songs on the next two, and down to maybe one good song on the last album, an NONE here. They're done. It's over.
6305095442|5|this is not a gore feast, this is a evil dead film. don't come on here whining it was not gory enough, if you want gore go see a peter jackson film! as i said before, this is a evil dead film, its just so damn cool.  the reason everyone loves this film so much is because its just, well, its  cool! every thing is purposly made silly and dumb. its a evil dead film!
B007VUCAVO|5|A great little app, I use it frequently.  Its well priced and performs a needed service.  I liked it enough to purchase it and I don't purchase many apps.
B00GQQ75QO|5|Great copy thank you
B00005JLKN|5|now I HAVE it was a good good good good movie to see just like the 3 of collector's AND IT COME IN WIDESCREEN
B00IL0GLU4|5|I first seen this on PBS.  They wanted an arm and a leg for this set. Granted, I'm sure a lot of the money went to supporting local channels but I just couldnt fork out the 180 they were wanting for this set. So I turned to amazon. Two days later, I was watching it in surround sound in my living room. I think the cd sounds better in surround sound than the actual Blu Ray.  It's amazing sound quality regardless. This is an amazing set, and I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.com.
B00H2EQFBK|5|Absolutely love it!!!!
B008133MDK|5|Loved it! Now I have to wait so long for Season 3 to be out! Great new interpretation of a classic and amazing cast to boot.
B00794ML3Y|5|I was very interesting.It tells the story from both sides of the desk. All the plots were good. If you wonder what motivates people to do the things they do, this is for you.
B00P9J58RC|5|Awesome app. Instantly identifies peaks from self contained database. No connection required after install. Does what world peaks in layar once did, but stopped working and required camera and connection. PeakFinder is much better. Fast. Simple. Self contained. Perfect for hiking.
0439023521|5|I got this book because I watched the movie and really liked it. The book is so much better. You get a better sense of who Katniss is and why she does things. Also, I understood Peeta a lot better in the book than the movie. It's really good and I recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|1|I found it rather boring, I have not finished reading it at this time so maybe it will get better.
B00CSCJ09K|4|Looking forward to the movie with him.  He is very talented, I am sure playing a Violinist will be easy for him.
B00AESN8XY|5|Fun and addictive.  It's challenging enough to keep your attention while some of the levels are easy enough to keep you from getting frustrated.
B00005ATQM|5|I'm a huge Metallica fan and listening to this DVD was like hearing it for the first time.  The sound is incredible.  I was pretty much swallowed by all the instruments coming from all over the place.  I definetly recommend this to any Metallica fan.  You must have a complete surround sound system including a subwoofer to get the whole effect.  I think DVD-Audio is going to be the next great thing.  I can't wait until more releases!!<br />Carlos
B00DPM7TIG|5|Beautifully written, descriptive, sensitive, moving and thought-provoking book.
1571200851|5|I purchased Fantastic Fabric Folding by Rebecca Wat when I was looking for ways to use what I knew of origami in different and novel ways.  It is a lovely book, and I enjoyed it very much.  While I was not always impressed with the author's projects or with her choice of fabrics--which I thought were often rather dull--I  was very impressed with some of the designs and uses for the folded objects (usually flowers) themselves.  My favorites were Ms Wat's Inside-out (pp. 24-32) and Polygon Flowers (pp. 49-74).<br /><br />While, as I said, I'm not certain I'd use these in quite the way Ms Wat does--she appears to be a professional quilter, which I am not, with all the patience that that implies--I can definitely see myself using them for simpler projects of my own.  I have a good friend who invites me to all her family holiday dinners, and who enjoys decorating her table for the occasion.  I plan to make a table runner for her using the book for both my inspiration and my instruction.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money.
B005V2EVBQ|5|I bought this for my husband's Kindle Fire.  I wanted something tough, but lightweight and this cover really is perfect.
B000002H8F|4|This album is not my favorite &quot;album&quot; of the Pixies, because I think &quot;Doolittle&quot; and &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot; are albums you can listen straight through and savour every song. &quot;Bossanova&quot;  has some of the Pixies greatest songs on it, in my opinion, songs like -  &quot;Cecilia Ann&quot;, &quot;Rock Music&quot;, &quot;Velouria&quot;,  &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Is She Weird?&quot;, &quot;Ana&quot;, &quot;All  Over The World&quot;, &quot;Dig For Fire&quot;, and &quot;Hang Wire&quot;.  But everything else, all five songs, just aren't up to snuff, compared to,  really, the first half of the album. But even the Pixies &quot;filler&quot;  is great compared to Matchbox 20, Semisonic, Sugar Ray, Smash Mouth, blah  blah blah you know the rest. &quot;Bossanova&quot; is still one great  album.
B009KS4XRO|5|This is a very fun game time play. Sometimes it takes a long time for prizes to come up.  Should not have to be on Facebook to get some few a rewards.
006016848X|1|I've come in contact with so many people (men and women included) and I will tell you that I have yet to find the belief that men and women are inherently different in relational ways helpful to me or anyone who find new interesting ways to perpetuate these supposed differences. I find it more helpful to employ the belief that people all across the board are different. People are so varied and deep in their experiences and inherent abilities. I have found it much more liberating to think beyond the stars in terms of our differences and sameness.     The good things that I found in the book should be shared among all people, whether or not they have a penis or a vagina or both or none for that matter. As long as we can find one exception to our rules of thumb about men and women, it is more beneficial to the growth of humanity that we seek to honor the individual differences that each person brings to this world and also to respectfully encourage our capacity to improve in the ways we relate to each other. I believe there are principles of higher conduct such as kindness, patience, selflessness, maturity, perseverance, open-mindedness, overall character development, etc. Our challenge as a human race is not to get to the bottom of any relational difference between the sexes. Our challenge, I believe, is to impart with integrity and equity, principles of character development among all people, despite identified sex, nationality, ethnic affiliation, cultural background, etc. I encourage each person to get a subscription to ebscohost (if you can). Contact your local university to learn more about ebscohost. This is a wonderful database where you can access journals that print research-based articles on any subject matter. Here you will find (under the subject matter of men and women) that relationally, when we look beyond mars and venus, there are more differences among the sexes than between the sexes. Upon reviewing the literature, you will find that here on planet earth, in cultures where our ideas of gender differences do not exist, depression among women especially, is significantly less. Review the literature for yourself and see how men and women in other cultures choose to relate to each other. John Gray certainly didn't before writing his book. If anyone proves otherwise, I stand corrected on this one, but I didn't see any bibliography or footnotes and the only 3 (maybe 4) statements that were referenced as support for his entire book were improperly sited.
B00B52F278|5|My husband loves this series.
B005K0HDGE|5|One of the fastest reads for me. Hard to put down. Made me miss the 60's. Like so many people that was alive when Kennedy was shot I remember where I was and what I was doing. What drew me to the book was that I too have wondered &#34;what if.&#34;
B00JJHDX9A|3|fell asleep twice
B0054JZC6E|5|I downloaded this game and played it 1 before I started to love it. I think its the best game ever.
B006LSZECO|4|A little sadistic and far fetched and at times a bit unrealistic, especially in the ending (why would anyone with a lick of sense consent to that arrangement?), but overall a good tale that exercises a number of stereotypical behaviors.
B004SOR4H6|5|It's a nice app works nice but sometimes it laggs but it's cool
B00AZM7IQC|5|A spectacular show of amazing human acrobats, music and colors.  You should not miss this wonderful performance, full of magic.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|This is a very interesting story of interwoven lives.  People are confronted with their excuses, their belief in justice, their assumptions and needs.  What makes the story interesting is very believable roles and choices.  It's a very enjoyable read.
B00002Z88D|3|Its ok. The highlights are &quot;battery&quot; and the best song on the ablum &quot;one&quot;
B00G7QPYX4|3|I was expecting more after all the talk about Cate's performance. She was as good as advertised as was the rest of the cast. But the characters were not appealing as most were unsympathetic to some degree. I have seen and enjoyed many of Allen's films but this one was not engaging. Perhaps I was not in the right frame of mind to appreciate it.
B00FKF0F3C|3|not as good as rhe first 2
B009WO7NQO|5|The best of the series so far! All you have to do is add Star Wars to anything and it makes it better but this exceeds expectations!
1451673442|5|I absolutely love this book. It was a great read and it was nice to have daily exercises so that you can master it.
1400082773|5|Barack Obama is the junior Senator from Illinois, and only the third African American who was elected to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction.<br /><br />He bested Republican nominee Alan Keyes in a historic contest which had pitted two African American candidates against each other.<br /><br />Re-release of Obama's 1995 biography provides the additional national attention which he definitely has earned.<br /><br />Obama received national accolades for his primetime Democratic convention 2004 speech, but the thrust of his book is his life story.  Born in Hawaii to a family with high aspirations, Obama also temporarily lived in Jakarta before coming back to the United States to live with his grandparents, but his mother returned later.<br /><br />Those life experiences have provided Obama with the grounding he needed to succeed in education and the work environment. Undertaking and completing challenging tasks is routine for Obama.<br /><br />His first post-college job was organizing Altgeld Gardens's residents in Chicago.<br /><br />After graduating from Harvard Law School (where he made the prestigious review) he resumed a career in Chicago, this time helping to register voters in the 1992 election. Obama subsequently lectured at the University of Chicago until his Senate election.<br /><br />Demonstrated through his convention speech, Obama is thoughtful and articulate. Even if he's actually not intending to use this book as a presidential campaign launching pad, I can't help but admire a person who has accomplished so much---and still wants to accomplish much more. Resting on their own laurels would have been very easy for a person with his credentials, but he chose hard work.<br /><br />This book will make you believe: Obama for President.
B008JMKN4Y|4|Okay, so technically I did not READ this book. It is the first audiobook I’ve read…er, listened to. But the story is the story whether you read it yourself or someone reads it to you. I loved it, and toward the end I wished I was reading it because I could've read it faster than the narrator, Emma Galvin. She did a great job, but I was anxious to see how it would end. LOL!<br /><br />Setting aside my ambiguity regarding the audio format, I loved the book itself. The whole story is about two seriously flawed individuals trying to find their way to each other without destroying each other. There was not much to the storyline—boy wants girl; girl maybe wants boy; will they, won’t they—but the author develops the characters very well. They behave, speak, and interact exactly as you would expect young college students to do. The drama, immaturity, self-consciousness, and fear of rejection as well as the desire to belong, be accepted, be loved, and have a good time are all an integral part of transitioning from teenager to young adult. The characters and the story are chock full of all the angst of first love and establishing who you are.<br /><br />The book set me on an emotional roller coaster. First I thought Abby was a conservative young woman with a good upbringing, and Travis was the typical bad boy. I kept warning her off of him. As sexy and enticing as he was, she should run as far and as fast as she could. Then, I would change my mind and be on his side. I thought she was a tease and just messing with his head. He was really trying to change. Then his temper would flare and warning bells would go off in my head. And then she would give in and then back off because she was more worried about what people thought of her instead of how she and Travis felt about each other. And then when I found out about her past…well, let’s just say I couldn’t wait to listen to the last hour and finally find out if they ended up together or not!<br /><br />I liked the book so much, I immediately downloaded the second one, and I am several chapters into it already! I couldn’t wait to read it (um, listen to it) because Beautiful Disaster is told in the first person from Abby’s point of view, and the second book, Walking Disaster, is the same exact story, but from Travis’ point of view. Brilliant!e book so much, I immediately downloaded the second one, and I am several chapters into it already! I couldn’t wait to read it (um, listen to it) because Beautiful Disaster is told in the first person from Abby’s point of view, and the second book, Walking Disaster, is the same exact story, but from Travis’ point of view. Brilliant!
B00BGIC2J2|2|Its just depressing........ Its not a witty look into the struggles that come with life........ Its only funny in that the characters are pathetic and off-putting......... The humour seems to want to break through but it just doesnt deliver.......you just end up feeling sorry.
B00CKOQC9C|1|Worst book ever... don't read this u will want to burn the book. U will hate this book don't read it
B00QTCOJPU|1|Too complicated game.Uninstall it.Lot of ad.
B000002UDG|4|They could make this CD perfect by removing the songs \\"C Moon\\" and \\"Junior's Farm\\" and then adding the songs \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" & \\"Take It Away\\".  Then after that they should digitally remaster it in modern terms and re-release it.  If they did this it would be a perfect compilation.  So do it.  Do it now!
B00KMX5V8G|5|Love love this g and could play for hours.

0812993292|5|Newly retired Harold Fry receives a letter from an old coworker and friend Queenie Hennessy, who he hasn't seen in twenty years.  She has terminal cancer and is living at a Hospice facility in the northern most reaches of England, she doesn't have much time left.  Harold living at one of the most southern points of the country, pens a note and walks to the post box at the end of the drive to drop it in when he changes his mind and decides that maybe his note isn't enough.  Maybe he needs to see Queenie. He begins walking and thinking about his life and talking to people along the way.  He embarks on what seems like a crazy endeavor, he's going to walk to Queenie, he's going to walk six hundred miles to see his old friend and he believes that she won't die as long as he keeps walking.<br /><br />As Harold walks he remembers things he hasn't thought of in years, he remembers things he's tried very hard to forget as well.  He makes this leap of faith to walk to Queenie and realizes that if he goes back home to get a map and his cell phone or if he stops to figure out the best route to take that he will not be able to complete his journey.  As he starts off he talks to people and tells them his plan to walk.  `They believed in him.  They had looked at him in his yachting shoes, and listened to what he said and they had made a decision in their hearts and minds to ignore the evidence and to imagine something bigger and something infinitely more beautiful than the obvious.'<br /><br />He meets many people along the way that offer him assistance of one kind or another and in their offer of tangible help they also bring a piece of their lives into his.  Most seem to understand the importance of what he's trying to do despite the improbability of it.  One woman offers him a plate of bread and butter and apple slices.  She says \\"You'd think walking should be the simplest thing.  Just a question of putting one foot in front of the other.  But it never ceases to amaze me how difficult the things that are supposed to be instinctive really are.\\"  She wet her lower lip with her tongue, waiting for more words.  \\"Eating\\" she said at last.  \\"That's another one.  Some people have real difficulties with that.  Talking too.  Even loving.  They can all be difficult. \\"  She watched the garden, not Harold.  \\"Sleeping\\" he said.  She turned \\"Don't you sleep?\\"  \\"Not always.\\"  He reached for more apple.  There was another silence.  Then she said, \\"Children.\\"  \\"I beg your pardon?\\"  \\"There's another one.\\"  He glanced again at her washing line, the perfect rows flowers.  He felt the resounding absence of young life.<br /><br />I really loved this book, I loved the writing, the storytelling and the way Harold's life is revealed to us.  The course his path takes as he makes his way toward Queenie, the people he meets along the way, his recollections, reflections and regrets as well as the understanding and realizations that come to him on his journey, it all has a universal feeling to it.  I thought this story was an allegory of sorts but a contemporary and accessible version that I think most people will enjoy.  I highly recommend it.fficult the things that are supposed to be instinctive really are.\\"  She wet her lower lip with her tongue, waiting for more words.  \\"Eating\\" she said at last.  \\"That's another one.

B000BMSTMS|5|My name is Alvin, KoRn street team name is davesilvera, and i have been a KoRn fan for years and years. I have been waiting for this album to come out for a long time and was more than satisfied when i actually bought it. Here is my song - by - song review of the album.  <br /> <br />1. Twisted Transistor - A bit poppy but i can see why they chose it as a single. It is really good to listen to when just chilling. The guitaring is very unique and the beat is awesome. Also, the vocals are great on this song.  <br /> <br />2. Politics - A very odd and original song. It has heavy doom-metalish guitaring for the verses, and the chorus/pre-chorus are just straight out KoRn. This song is about how corrupt sex, organized religion, and politics have become, and it is a very powerful song.  <br /> <br />3. Hypocrites - This song starts out very very indsutrial-like, with a hint of Rage Against the Machine, but is still straight up heavy-riffed KoRn. Very loud and powerful guitars with a great beat. This song seems to be, lyrically, about how in church you are taught not to be greedy while your pastors are stealing cash from the church themselves. This song is very pleasable to the ear though, especially during the verses when munky plays an octave higher than the rest of the riff and jon starts sounding like something you would expect in a religious musical. Also, Munky screaming \\" Hypocrites \\" sounds great.  <br /> <br />4. Souvenir - Starts out with a heavy riff. Everything is mixxed just about right. Every aspect of this song is just straight-out KoRn, and this is probably the song that would fit the best on a previous KoRn album, has a very traditional KoRn feel.  <br /> <br />5. 10 or a 2-way - A fairly odd song, but very cool. Has a great drum intro. Very heavy riffage again, and great use of effects in it. One of the most unique tracks on this entire album. It even has a slight manson-esque feel to it.  <br /> <br />6. Throw Me Away - Another very unique track. after 8measures of drums jon starts out by saying \\" flesh, wound, flesh, wound, with medication it will fade \\", so right from the start you know you are stepping into a new KoRn territory. The song is fairly slow though, but it has some really heavy parts in it.  <br /> <br />7. Love Song - It starts out with a nice munky riff with some cool effects on it, has great synth work in this song rtight from the begining, again very manson-esque. The vocals are very angry, and this is a very refreshing song to listen to.  <br /> <br />8. This song starts out with some tradition KoRn slap bass and awesome drum beats. You gotta hand it to fieldy and david for this track. When munky kicks in everything just gets better though. This song sounds like it should be the next single, if hypocrites or politics are not. This one seems fairly depressing and angry, which is exactly what KoRn are famous for ( jokes ).  <br /> <br />9. Coming Undone - Starts out with a nice heavy, extremely distorted, riff. This is a fairly traditional sound song for KoRn though guitar-wise, but david's drumming sounds completely different from anything else he has ever done for the band before. The song is all-around cool, with a good mixture of new KoRn and old KoRn in it.  <br /> <br />10. Getting Off - It starts out with a heavy riff again by Munky with some cool effects in the background. The chorus sounds familiar though. Jon sings ' getting off, im getting off, keep getting off, keep getting off, im getting off, im getting off to you \\" and any hardcore KoRn fan will be remind of the song sean olson where jon screams \\" im cumming im cumming im cumming on you  \\". The vocals are superb on this track though. They are fit the song so tightly that it is a wonder about how jon does this stuff.  <br /> <br />11. Liar - Another traditional KoRn riff for the intro... Until the effects kick in. This song is obviously about... Head. The song is heavy through and through, and very angry.  <br /> <br />12. For No one- This song is very empowering but strange. It starts out heavy and fast, chills out for a few moments, and kicks back in and out again. The chorus is very heavy guitar-wise and jd dragsd the vocals on for, which does fit the song. This song also has great bass and percussion in it.  <br /> <br />Seen It All - Starts out slow, very slow, with a siren-like sound ( most likely an armonica ). This song is definitely their most unique song ever, with multiple instruments in it ranging from the armonica to bagpipes. This song doesnt have a manson-esque feel or a NIN-esque feel, but it sounds like this is a song that would inspire an industrial band. Everything from the vocals to the instruments are different from anything else KoRn has ever done. The outro is very long and instrumental, but fits the song well.  <br /> <br />14. Tearjerker - The title is self-explanatory. It is a great, slow, sad song. What else is there to say?  <br /> <br />I definitely suggest buying this album if you like KoRn, Industrial, Manson, System of a Down, or Alternative Metal at all. If i was allowed to i would give this album a 10 out of 5 stars, but sadly it doesnt let you.
B002UM5BXW|5|Lots of sex drugs and rock 'n roll. But Bourdain does admit that his way is not the only way. Very compelling character. I couldn't put it down

1402568851|5|Christopher, who has autism is the narrator of this fictionalized book. The book begins with a neighbor's dog, named Wellington, being killed. Christopher decides to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington.<br /><br />I listened to the audiotape of the book because it was a selection for our book club and all print copies were out of the library. It seemed like such a weird title and premise for a book that I did not want to waste the money if it was not good.<br /><br />The narrator for this audiobook, Jeff Woodman, was awesome. You really felt like the author (as Christopher) was telling the story. I really think hearing the story vs reading the story was beneficial in many ways. When he starts talking about colors and how they affect whether it will be a good or bad day; when he describes his rationale and views on life, school, honesty; all these things have a powerful impact when you hear \\"Christopher\\" talk about them. You realize he is a genius in \\"maths\\", trapped in a mind that is restricted in some ways and totally, perfectly clear in others. Listening to Christopher speak, you have a better understanding of his logic. The revelations he discovers when he is trying to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington also bring about chaos, distrust and disorder in his well=structured life.<br /><br />His view of the world, his honesty and naivete' all come out in the voice of the story. Mr. Woodman's voice was perfect and Christopher was magically transformed for me. I definitely finished this audiobook with a different perspective about those with high functioning autism/Asperger's affects the individual, the family and those around them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for bringing an enlightening view to a topic that is rarely discussed.
B001BTG3OQ|4|This flash work as described by the manufacturer. The Nikon Lighting system (CLS) works flawless every time. I usually build a studio on the go and this flash let me do all the work.
B008LXZFH6|5|If you don’t know by now the movie Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is “kind of a big deal.” It is one of the most iconic comedy movies of all time and is deservedly so. The movie, which debuted in 2004, is set in seventies, but it does not feel dated at all. In fact, it takes full advantage of its setting, expertly using it as a springboard for its plot and some jokes. The movie has a great cast, full with some of Hollywood’s best comedic actors, such as Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and Vince Vaughn, who all put on fantastic performances. For each character there are multiple one-liners, with each one as good as the next. This myriad of hysterical, albeit stupid, lines makes for what is in my estimation the most quotable movie ever.<br />Unlike other movies of its kind, Anchorman never seems to get stale. I have watched it countless times and find that it is hilarious every time, even though I know practically every line by heart. If you are one of the few people who have yet to see this masterpiece, I highly recommended it (as if you already couldn’t tell). This is without a doubt Ferrell’s best work and the perfectly crafted Ron Burgundy, his best character. If you see Anchorman and you don’t like it, well then I might just have to punt you off a bridge.
B00511PTWM|2|Charger worked well for a couple of days, have replaced fuse, worked one day and quit again.  Not worth buying the $2.00 fuse to keep it working for a day.  I would not recomend product, very dissapointed.
B00N1HONIO|5|Its very fun
B00MDY635W|5|The. author. combined an emotionally isolated protagonist with  intrigue, a desolate setting, and a fast-paced series of events to create a complex work of intrigue.  I challenge the reader to figure who is the  bad man..<br /><br /> author managed to combine R

B000068PQ0|5|\\"The Soft Bulletin\\" was my introduction to The Flaming Lips. So, on first listen \\"Yoshimi....\\" didn't quite do it for me. It doesn't have the sonic sweep and layered, lush feel of \\"Soft...\\" In a sonic sense, it's \\"smaller.\\" But, when I revisited it a few months later it really hooked me. There's an innocence and optimism that is rare in today's jaded musical environment. And yes, Wayne Coyne can sometimes sneak in some fairly childish rhymes, \\"She's gotta be strong to fight them/So she's taking lots of vitamins.\\" But I'll give him a pass on that one since the rest shows him and his mates at a new level of maturity.<br />Although the Robot theme is played out in the first 4 songs, for me it's the closing sequence of \\"It's Summertime/Do You Realize?/All We Have Is Now/Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon\\" that really clinched this for me. These songs carry a theme of loss, regret and hope packaged in some of the cleanest, most concise arrangements the Lips have ever done. <br />And as a final thought....if you ever get the chance to see these guys live....run to get your tickets. Saw them in LA two months ago and they are undoubtedly one of the must see live acts today. I guarantee you won't forget it. Where else will you see a large squirrel, a rabbit, Jesus and Santa Claus grooving on-stage to a whacked out tune like \\"Lightning Strikes the Postman.\\"
B000002BMV|5|All one has to do is listen to the first 3 songs on Escape (Don't Stop Believin', Stone In Love, Who's Crying Now) to know this is a VERY special record.<br /><br />These are three of the greatest songs in the bands' long and ever-changing members history. And I have to believe the addition of Jonathan Cain is the primary reason for the new creative direction of the song-writing heard here (as he & Steve Perry co-wrote 8 of the 10 songs, and Neal Schon joined in on two others).<br /><br />Who's Crying Now is one of the greatest power ballads in the entire history of rock / pop music from beginning to end of the song. Steve Perry's vocals are extraordinary. This is a true showcase of his amazing vocal range.<br /><br />Everyone knows Don't Stop Believin' by now, thanks to a resurgence in its popularity, due in large part to the finale of The Sopranos and Glee. Its one of those songs you just can't help but enjoy.<br /><br />Stone In Love is perhaps Journey's best song that never became a &#34;commercial hit&#34; (say top 10). And that is a shame, because this is such an upbeat song about the good old days of young, carefree love.<br /><br />The main title track, about rebelling against authority and finding your own way in life (that's how I interpret it, anyway) could have been used in any number of movies in the 1980s.<br /><br />Open Arms is the band's greatest commercial success, spending several weeks at #2 on the Billboard Pop charts.<br /><br />Still They Ride is one of the better songs of the remaining bunch, and is pretty well-liked by true Journey fans.<br /><br />Forget what the critics say, or anyone who may be biased against pop / &#34;arena rock&#34; bands.<br /><br />Just enjoy this exceptional album, put together by the all-too-short lived lineup of Steve Perry, Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Steve Smith and Ross Valory.<br /><br />You won't regret it!
B000ULQV0W|5|Words can not even describe the movie and the soundtrack. I definitely think you need to see the film first. The music completely goes with all the scenes (scenery and cinematography).    I'm not a huge pearl jam fan. I like them, but Eddie Vedder's solo here has really given me more respect for him as an artist. The fact that he plays every instrument on this album is amazing.    Eddie said yes to producing the score without even seeing the film. He then saw it came through with these ballads which are somewhat haunting but not in a negative way. For some reason this film and soundtrack are tugging at my heart.    Best songs are: Society, Long Nights, Guaranteed, End of The Road, No Ceiling. I like all the other tracks as well but these really stick out in my mind. You hear these melodies and you take a deep breath and reflect on life and have images in your mind about the film.    I can't stop listening to this album or thinking about the film. Call me obsessed, but you definitely need to see this movie and buy this soundtrack!
B006MW3UZW|5|All the characters are involved in this series and one can hardly wait to get into the next episode to see what happens next.
B002JVWQSW|5|Modern Family has something for everyone!  Great acting, clever, orginal scripts, and warmth and humor combine to make this a great series that can (and should) be watched over and over again.  As you will see in this Season 1 DVD, the show hits the ground running and has only gotten better as it goes along.<br /><br />It is great to see the interactions between the characters...parents-children, husbands-wives, in-laws, brothers and sisters, and so on.  We get to know them, along with their hopes and dreams, wants and needs, and yes, flaws or quirks, which only serve to endear them to us even more.  While we may not understand exactly what attracted the young, fiery Gloria to Jay, or how Cam from Missouri happened to stumble into the Pritchett clan, just be glad they did!<br /><br />Just to select a favorite episode or two...The Incident (which could more accurately be titled The Calamity) and Up all Night both keep the laughs coming.  Airport 2010 makes you wonder if the family will ever get on board the plane, but even if they are not having fun during the seemingly-endless wait, the viewers certainly are!  Finally, listen carefully during Coal Digger....is that REALLY what Claire was saying?<br /><br />Oh, that was four episodes, wasn't it?  Well, as each viewer will see, it is very difficult to narrow down!  The DVD also includes deleted and alternate scenes, gag reels, and interviews.<br /><br />We all need a laugh every now and then, and Modern Family provides them in abundance!  If you watch Season 1, you will then be hooked on Seasons 2, 3, 4, and all that follow!  Enjoy!
B008TMA1LY|5|Needs to be more player friendly by letting you earn points instead of purchasing them however the game draws you in it makes you want to keep playing this is very relaxing to play
0780622553|4|This was more of a 3.5 star movie but I rounded up.  True, it is a beautiful looking film.  The story is intriguing.  But on my 2nd viewing I did not feel it held up to my first impresssions.  I'm having trouble  pointing to what let me down this 2nd time.  I think the acting, at times,  did not emotionally engage me.  Rather I was watching the film for the  interest of the story - the events that unfold for these characters.  But  the characters themselves did not hold me.  Replace them with another group  of individuals and I would be watching an equivalent movie.
B00J2VSS0C|3|Another reviewer mentioned it would be nicer if the story line was more accessible, if I knew the meaning of the amulets, and there was more continuity in the story. It's also frustrating when you are trying to uncover an object but it remains elusive too long.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Can't beat free you know?  Lots of levels and good graphics.  And it allows a reset when the tiles are out of matches.
0060775858|5|I took care of a little boy. He brought this book to my home and my puppy ate it. I looked on line and found it's replacement very easily. It came within days. It was worth hte huge smile on his face when he saw it.
B003MC5N28|4|I wasn't sure what to expect from these books and really only started to read them because I heard about the film ( though I  have not seen it). I thought the concept and the storyline were interesting and I enjoyed the book. I went on to read the other three books in the series and was left feeling a little confused. The books don't really explain why there are different communities in different stages of development. The first book details a community that is technologically very advanced, the second book a community verging on medieval the third and fourth books on bringing the characters together in a different community but you don't really understand (or at least I didn't) why these communities existed in such varying degrees of development and why. The books were interesting and I did enjoy them but they left me feeling as though the were slightly underdeveloped. They could have been more
B00003CXHJ|3|U-571 is a new film that has been released in the USA and around the world been fairly successful.<br />In the film there are two main countries that are fighting each other (the Germans and the Americans). The Americans of course are made out to be the courageous men wearing the white suits and the finely shaved beards looking very smart to the viewer. This then made them look like the good guys in the film. The Germans are made out to be the bad guys in the film with their dress been rather scrubbed up and their beards been not shaven at all. <br />The film rather in accurate in the way it betrayed both of countries in the way that they did. An inaccuracy was that the Americans weren't even in the war yet. The Americans didn't move in to the war until a later stage.<br />Overall I thought that the film was rather inaccurate and wasn't good to be bartered on the film that was released in the cinema. I gave the film 3/5.
B00011F5DK|5|I bought this for an 8 year old for Christmas.  The evening was spent with adults taking turns playing.  So many laughs and tons of fun.  The kids helped!!  Definitely educational too!
0143038419|2|It's alright- I love love loved the movie but could not seem to get through this book- It's slow and just drags on and on. After purchasing and reading I learned from a few of my friends that they felt the same way about this book as I do- Skip the book, just watch the movie and thats advice that i've NEVER given before!
B00IKZX1ZI|1|Too hard for adults let alone children.  Thumbs down!
014242417X|5|Normally, I hate romance novels. They're mushy and romanticize the actuality of love way too much. But this was different. I wouldn't even call it a romance novel. I wouldn't even say there was a romance. There was reality, and love occurs in reality as well as all of the other things, both pleasant and unpleasant, in life. There's a honesty in this book that is refreshing, yet it always rings sincere and true as well. While the story revolves around two teen cancer patients, this definitely is not a &#34;cancer book.&#34;  The characters are so interesting and you get swept away in their thoughts and emotions - again, both pleasant and unpleasant - and it makes for an enjoyable ride.  This was also a surprisingly quick read.  I haven't added a book to my list of all-time favorites in a while, but this one definitely makes the cut.
B00IJJUIMY|5|It's hard to pinpoint what was so good about this book, but I enjoyed it and found it hard to put down.  Harry gets on the case, stays with it, and doesn't get side tracked.  Working on dead cases, he hammers away, developing new evidence, or developing it from what others didn't follow up on.  This book involves two cases, not connected, one deals with the killing of a Mariachi musician closed for 10 years, and a fire that was closed over 25 years in which 9 children died in a day care center.  I don't really like a lot of the police procedural style books I read, but I give Mr. Connelly credit by making the story interesting and not boring, as many of these type of books are.  He doesn't get, bogged down in the science, and keeps the story interesting and human, not getting drowned in the science and techniques as so many do.  Personally Harry seems not to have much going for him and he is totally involved in his work, which leaves him and the reader wondering what will happen to him on his retirement.  Which might be happening sooner than expected.  Writers control their stories, or the novel can run away from them, especially mysteries.  This story was very controlled. Witness remembering facts far after the events.  In this novel I \\"just\\" accepted it, but normally I wouldn't.  This book was full of these type of bits and pieces.  A hired assassin murdered by his client?  Why?  Especially after the case was closed.  Evidence found hidden for ten years?
B00JAC25FM|3|Great game, I give it five stars.
B00BAXFECK|4|The Goldfinch follows a motherless teenager through a druggy and alcoholic haze into a seemingly endless loop of bad decisions and heart-warming redemptions. In the opening chapters, I worried that Theo Decker would turn into yet another pathetic Holden Caulfield, stumbling through the usual misunderstood boy in private school situations. However, as the story migrates from Manhattan to New York and Holland, Theo's story transcends the cliche. Though the writing is almost sublimely brilliant, a preachy, overtly philosophical final 50 pages was like an scratch across a masterpiece.
B009LQKHIO|5|I started reading this series by Jill Sanders it totally won me right from the start!  This series is so romantic, sexy and steaming I kept reading one book after the other loving each one and more!  This series has it all and you won't be disappointed.  Jill has a way with words and actions and the couples will have you wanting for more!  So get ready and settle down you will truly love this series!  Great job Jill!
B00DONJXGM|5|It's amazing to see Joe Cocker at age 69 perform with such energy.  His voice is vintage Joe Cocker and his soul comes through on all songs here. &#34;Fire It Up&#34; is a great title and that's exactly what he does. It's a shame that the idiots who gave this one star don't know the difference between a customer service issue and what they're supposed to rate here.
B009VGJV0Y|4|entertaining movie, but wasnt cool with ending, hopefully we will se this actress in more movies in the future ya
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great way to end trilogy.<br />They movies did the book trilogys justice looking forward to the last movie coming out.
B00004Y6Q5|5|A bit like the movie - not for everyone, unfortunately. This doesn't hold the popular appeal of a &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack, but would you want it to? More contemporary fare (I could easily see either David Parson's Dance Company or Graeme Murphy's Sydney Dance Company dancing to selections from this). If you like your soundtracks more contemporary, a little bit more experimental and more atmospheric this could be for you, and I'd highly recommend it. The tracks are appropriately divided into three sections. Starting with &quot;Summer&quot;, passing through &quot;Fall&quot; and finally sinking into &quot;Winter&quot;, there is no Spring here. &quot;Summer Overture&quot; and &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; are two of the best examples of the simple tune that permeates the rest of the album (e.g., &quot;Cleaning Apartment&quot;, &quot;Marion Barfs&quot;, &amp; &quot;Winter Overture&quot;) and immediately make you think - Requiem for a Dream. It is a beautiful and thoughtful piece of work. Appropriately mournful and haunting. However the happier and more lively &quot;Party&quot; and &quot;High on Life&quot; (short and sweet at only 11 seconds long) go some way to making up for this. I can't help but think that the slightly wacky &quot;Bialy &amp; Lox Conga&quot; and &quot;Bugs Got a Devilish Grin Conga&quot; could have easily been used in scenes from Baz Luhrmanns Strictly Ballroom (e.g., reminiscing about the parents dance competitions). Clint Mansell knows his stuff: he manages to compliment and amplify the feel of the movie beautifully. Indeed, he creates the landscape of the film with his music. <BR>     Darren Aronofsky is a gifted and promising director (his 2 major movies to date put him in my Top 10 Directors list). He has managed to find in Clint Mansell a composer whose work compliments his own style so perfectly and that is important. As another famous director/producer allegedly said, the music is 50% of the movie. That can be clearly seen and heard in Requiemfor a Dream. 4 1/2 stars from me!
B00FAX6XQC|2|Everything was fine until I got to level 13.  Got my updates, screen went totally white.  Had to re install and lost  all my progress.  Not so much fun anymore.
6305120706|5|Love this movie! Am such a cat lover and can find many of those I have known in this film.
B00I629XPW|5|Viewers who enjoy very suspenseful action films will really enjoy this movie and those who want their action flicks joined with ravaging zombies will be thrilled with it. In the movie the world is infected by some bacteria or virus that turned people into zombies. Once these zombies bite anyone, they turn the others. Cities are thronged by these creatures. No one seems safe.<br /><br />Brad Pitt had once worked for the UN in dangerous places. He is asked to go to South Korea where the infection began. He does not want to get involved. Something happened to him in the past that makes him want to simply stay with his wife and kids. But when the leaders tell him that if he does not go, they will not protect his family, he goes first to South Korea, then to Israel, then to Wales. Will he figure out how to stop the plague and, if so, how?
B00MILGKPI|4|I always loved the original. I have to say that I was impressed with this version. I would watch it again.
B007MJSQ2G|5|This movie is a treasure.  One to be viewed over and over.  The story grabs you and doesn't let go until the last scene.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Highly recommend it.
B000P0J0AQ|5|I received my order in perfect shape and in no time flat. I will most definitely use this seller again.This completes my set.
B00AYHKIZ6|5|Bowie again at his best
B004GJDQT8|5|Awesome!!
B005K0HDGE|5|AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING BOOK
B0031KE9C6|5|Very entertaining!!! I'm sad that they stopped after the third season. I am stoked that the movie is coming out in March!!
B0073O0AME|4|I can't call myself a Tony Bennett &#34;fan&#34;, but over the years I have enjoyed his music.  While Tony isn't in his prime here, he is more than just &#34;good for his age&#34;.  Seeing and hearing the chemistry between him and his partners on these tracks is worth the price of admission and the respect and admiration of his companions is evident in the music and in the videos.  The bonus with the video is hearing what his partners have to say about their collaborations and their feelings about Tony.<br /><br />I can't say there are any clunkers here, even though I'm afraid I just can't relate to Amy Winehouse.  And although I am a bit of a Willie Nelson fan, I felt that track was a bit of a walk-through and, while still good, was not as inspired as other tracks.  There were a few moments when I felt Tony's voice didn't quite support the inspiration of the moment, but there were many more moments of brilliant, if sometimes subtle collaboration that are purely inspiring.  He really comes alive, both musically and visually on the track with Lady Gaga.  I'd never paid much attention to Lady Gaga, but this performance definitely got my attention.  Failure to mention the other fine artists and performances on this album should not be taken as a slight.  I don't want to over-analyze; I prefer to savor the experience.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole album and we each now have a couple new artists we would like to listen to some more.<br /><br />Thank you, Tony.
B003TSEEDY|5|When I picked up this book yesterday,I didn't have any knowledge of it whatsoever. A close friend had previously recommended it but I want even half aware of the joy, pleasure,and sorrow this book would bring to me in a few hours.<br />One thing you should know is that I am quite the picky reader. Unless I'm immediately hooked I rarely continue reading.<br />But the thing about \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is that it grabs you from the beginning. It has the unusual format of writing in a letter form, but it remains confidential for whom the letters are addressed to.<br />Advancing further into the novel, you become aware that Charlie seems to be socially awkward, to say the least. His family is mentioned but no names, which seems to give the piece a sense of mystery and personally was one of the factors that triggered me into finishing (although to my distress the facts were never answered).<br />Almost immediately I had sympathy for Charlie, which certain characters like his family lacked; eventually this lead to the disapproval of his family who were not very intimate in the book regardless. So it was around this time where I would cry uncontrollably because even if there are much worse events occurring in the world, there will always be a soft spot in my heart for the socially troubled Charlie.<br />Later in the book Charlie meets the incredible Sam and Patrick who looking back are the perfect example of the types on teenagers, and that example proves itself further when other characters, such as Bob or Brad are introduced. In my opinion, all these different types of people who are are depressed, lazy or even sexually confused join together regardless of  stereotypes, and bond. Even if it is bonding like smoking pot or kissing your gay best friend although you are straight, bonding is bonding nonetheless and out of this comes friendship.<br />So overall, this novel is spectacular. It has an interesting plot,and doesn't reveal the identities of characters andplaces. Not only was the writing phenomenal and humorous but also heartbreaking and possessing the power to make anyone emotional. So now after non-stop reading of this masterpiece I finally pour it down but strongly suggest of you reading it.<br />Mr. Chbosky, you are special.
B00AREIAI8|5|this game is so fun and the graphics are awesome!! although some of the pretqtiest horses are.qvery expensive in the game:/ but other wise it is very fun!!
B00P77ZAN8|5|The best app I've ever had.
B00CW665VI|5|Okay I don't even know where to begin. Tangled by Emma Chase is one of the best books I've read in a long time! I was laughing so hard through most of it although I still managed to get teary-eyed a couple of times (I'm sappy that way). I could not put this book down! Telling the story from Drew Evans' POV was just brilliant! So often we read these awesome books and then wish we could read them again from the guy's POV and Emma Chase provided that for us in the most entertaining, amusing and fun way possible! Drew is hilarious! I loved how he has no filter and just tells it like it is. Typical guy but you don't hate him for having his guy thoughts or guy beliefs because he owns up to them. He warns you that's who he is. And he is just lovable! And Kate is awesome in her own way too. This book is so well written! It sucks you in immediately and the characters, all of them, are amazing. I'd love to see this story continued and some of the supporting characters' stories developed more. I don't know if there is a plan for a sequel but I certainly hope so!! I highly highly recommend this book!!! loved it so much! Thank you Emma Chase for bringing us Drew's humor and allowing him to share his story while he's got the \\"flu\\".
034580404X|5|I've always heard of this book, but never felt the need to read it until I saw Fifty Shades of Grey movie. I was impressed and wanted to know more about Mr. Grey that I felt the need to read the books instead of waiting another two years to watch the sequel. I LOVED the whole trilogy. I'm so glad I purchased these books because they're worth every single cent. It was hard for me to put the books down. I would recommend these books to anyone who can keep an open mind when reading this.
B008JGSM6G|4|I really like this game.  Easy to figure out.  Easy to pick up/or leave when you need to.  Addictive - can't seem to put it down.
B00876TJ2E|5|I was on my first date when this movie originally came out.
B00756GKBA|5|The Madonna I grew up loving is back. Where to start? I'm going to list my favorites:<br /><br />1. I'm a Sinner-I love the 60's feel. The lyrics are a lot of fun also. A solid dance tune.<br />2. Gang Bang-It reminds me of Thief of Hearts, not in melody, but in fierce attitude. Love it.<br />3. Some Girls-I'm loving this one also. I hear Debbie Harry 80's on this one. Another fun track.<br />4. Love Spent-Wow. Banjo...electronica... This song has an interesting arrangement and completely changes at about the 2:08 mark. Love this song.<br />5. I'm Addicted-A solid dance hit.<br />6. Give Me All Your Luvin'-This one has grown on me now that I've heard the whole album.<br />7. Girl Gone Wild-Dance Hit!<br />8. Beautiful Killer-Another hit that sounds like it's from another decade.<br />9. Masterpiece-Gorgeous ballad. The Remix is hot also.<br /><br />I love the whole album, but I find myself repeatedly going back to the aforementioned songs. She's a living legend...the Queen of Pop...and this album leaves no doubt. It's been nice watching Madonna mature through the years, and when I see her in interviews  now she has a poise and sophistication that no other pop stars possess.
B000000WA4|5|I first heard this album years ago and it still lives on.. the soundscape and concept of this album are indescribable.  Billy Corgan may be the most talented musician alive and it shows.  These songs touch me probably more  than anything I've listened to.  It's very emotionally honest and sincere..  probably a good word to describe it would be &quot;manic-depressive&quot;  as it goes constantly from hard angry songs to soft depressing songs, or  love songs, but this is a good thing!   It is never boring and always  beautiful and incredible.  I also strongly recommend the Pumpkins' other  records, with the exclusion of Gish, which is good but not that great (and  don't believe all the garbage you've read about Adore, Pumpkins rule  forever! )
B004H6G0TI|5|Not bad, especially for a buck. It's challenging, nice to look at, smooth, and fun. You dog fight other airplanes while grabbing upgrades so you can nuke those jerks into the afterlife. It's a fun way to pass a little time now and then.
B0068853O6|5|Great show. If you liked the movie jarhead, you will love this show.
098478280X|5|Nothing to say here. Awesome book, really helpful. Amazing for practice!
B00FMQIMZ2|5|My daughter loves Olaf and she loves the decals on her wall.
B008OOYALE|4|Its fun; would have liked, to see a dragon that earns you money quick, otherwise it is pretty addictive to see what kind of eggs you get from mating 2 different dragons
B00AYB0TOW|4|Headline says it all.
B0028MBKVG|5|If you run, you need to read Born to Run. If you don't run, it's probably not a bad idea to read it anyway.
B004289ZW0|5|I've used a number of small GPS's and this is the best. I use it while flying in a small plane in combination with a navigation app on my iPad. The Bluetooth is great to reduce the number of cables in the cockpit. Once I had accidently left the unit turned on in my shirt pocket while flying and it still picked up enough satellites to provide a navigable signal.
B00BAXFECK|5|This book is amazing.
B00TEJB8JK|5|I absolutely love this band...original and heartfelt. I fell in love with them from the first note on their first album. This album is much more explorative and experimental in a comfortable way. Love the songs with more guitar parts and the vocals are tremendous. Glad to hear a band drop the gimmicks and just play.
B006O5XYWG|3|I thought it was so-so.  I'm a James Franco fan, and he is what kept me going throughout this movie.  It had some good action and drama, and overall a well developed story line.  But my enjoyment of the movie was greatly impacted by the crappy streaming via Amazon.  It seemed whenever there was a good action packed scene, it would freeze to the Amazon logo and say \\"connecting\\".  I have a fully active internet connection, so it wasn't that.  Also, the quality went up and down.  At some points it looked almost HD quality, then at other times it would get really blurry and pixelated.  It really ruined any good feelings I had about this movie and was incredibly frustrating.  This was my first Amazon movie purchase with my Prime membership, and it certainly didn't inspire me to use this feature again.
B00GINENG0|5|Best game since minecraft. It's so fun watching Tom grow up I recommend this to someone who loves animals. WARNING don't leave Tom alone for a long period of time
B005KR6NS6|3|There are movies, and then there are films. Like most guys, I prefer movies. The Tango Lesson is a film. Or at least it tries to be. It is shot mostly in black & white with a soft focus. I think it is supposed to be dream-like and slightly surreal. To me it just came off as annoying.  Likewise, the sub-plot of Ms. Potter as a script writer also comes across as rather silly. Rather than edgy or interesting, the snippets of movie scenes playing in her head are equal parts implausible and disturbing. In fact, the entire plot is weak and the script is incoherent. Ms. Potter's characters are cartoonish clichés--tiresome caricatures. And the characters aren't even likeable.  Ms. Potter behaves like a love-sick teenager, and she argues and fights like one too! Her crying jags made me cringe. At the same time, her dance & love interest Pablo Veron comes across as shallow, vain, and self-absorbed. He's a great dancer, but nothing else. The supporting actors are no better--just cardboard cutout props. But the movie does have two spectacularly good components--the dance and the music!  The dance sequences must've been shot by a dancer, because they are full body shots showing frame, lead, footwork--everything! The dance scenes are simply electrifying! I'm not kidding--I could hardly sit and watch this. I wanted to stand up and cheer. What I saw was a dazzling showcase of Argentine Tango. It left me feeling wretched that I can't dance at anything approaching that level, and determined to practice and improve my meager Tango skills. And oh my God the music!  I've always been a pop, rock, & metal kind of guy, but when I hear Osvaldo Pugliese it makes every other kind of music shrivel to insignificance. The music in this film is so intense & passionate I could feel the hairs on my neck standing up. When I heard &#34;La Yumba&#34; and watched them dance to it I thought my chest would explode. Words fail me. You have to experience this on a nice wide screen with good speakers to understand. It is beyond spectacular. So what's the verdict?  Get this film for the dancing and the music. It'll pierce your soul. Fast-forward through the rest of it.
B00FRQ32N4|1|This game is terrible. It is way too hard when you first start, you only have  five energy so you have to wait a lot, and it is way too hard to hit someone because they are always blocking on they always get counter attacks. Do not get this game.
B009UX2YAC|5|just got my kindle and started playing this briefly after and now.... I'm addicted. the game I've been playing for two hours has got me hooked to my game and kindle. thank you subway surfer game. I love you.
B008ROVTEW|5|Best sports movie in the history of mankind.
0740785508|5|This is one of the very best art books I own. Even if you're not interested in Fantasy art, there are many principles, beautifully explained, that are instructive for any type of art, especially drawing and painting. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Whatever kind of art you do, you will find something helpful, probably lots of helpful things, in this book.
0385349947|5|I loved how this book addressed women in the workforce. I am almost 50 and have seen such change in the workforce since I started working. It was great to read what Sheryl has observed and what her thoughts are on women working. Also, her suggestions on how to make it work are useful. The book also made me look at my career and how I am not &#34;Leaning In&#34; which is my choice and is okay. Many women might think Sheryl is crazy, you cannot do it all but there are many husbands willing to take a back seat for their wives to &#34;Lean In&#34; and it is an important topic to address today. Women don't have to have a more successful spouse where they are both working all the time and the kids are neglected. There are ways to make it work.
B0067Q42BY|5|I've been a fan of mahjong for a long time, and this is the best version I've ever played. G5 Entertainment also makes hidden object games which I love playing on the PC and I'm glad such games are available for Android.
B00BP3DPJY|5|Wow, this album totally caught me off guard. This album is amazingly well written and so enjoyable. Great to listen to for a relaxing day!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Great! Use this all the time.  Really think it is great. Have already told people about it.<br />Will keep using it almost everyday.
B001NHNG64|2|The basic story was good, but the details after a bit made the book boring.
0307730697|3|I have mixed feelings about Fearless, the account of real life hero and Navy SEAL, Adam Brown.  While I feel that the story of Adam's life -- his childhood, troubled young adulthood, his journey to become a SEAL and the struggles he faced due to his one time addiction -- is a triumph of God's power and provision, I am reluctant to recommend it to just anyone because of the profanity and crude language it contains.  I am not so naive to believe that the men our country trains to be our ultimate warriors are choir boys, but I am a little dismayed that Waterbrook (the publisher) chose not to edit the manuscript more closely.  I say all this because while I feel Fearless is certainly a story worth reading, you (the future reader) should be aware of some of its content.<br /><br />Fearless is the story of a real man. Adam Brown did have a lot of the characteristics of a super hero:  grit and determination, the attitude that he would rather die than quit and a love of family and country not to be paralleled. But Adam was human as well.  He hit bottom before joining the Navy -- drugs, felony charges, and the loss of respect and trust of his family and friends.  He struggled with the lure of drugs even into his Navy career.  But his steadfast faith and the love of his wife brought Adam to be the man that could be used by his country and by his God.  And the fact that he wanted his story, all of it, to be told is a testament to his trust in God and His power to change lives.<br /><br />So should you read Fearless?  If you want to know about a very courageous young man whose faith was in God and want to know a little of what our most elite warriors do to prepare and fight, then yes.  But be aware that the language may offend.<br /><br />(I received Fearless from Waterbrook in return for a review.  The opinions expressed are mine alone.)
B005LAIH2M|5|Fantastic viewing the second (or even third, fourth etc) time around! Not for kids, though, or the faint-hearted, but perfected for those who love seeing bad guys get dished out.
B007BT0RKG|5|I'm a bit of a sucker for maps but found this offline mapping great. With a GPS enabled device simply start up the app and you have a map of where you are. (presuming you have downloaded the appropriate map)
B005MMJ84K|4|The third book is set to be coming out in the month of March in the year 2013. Thank you.
B0014YVC6W|5|Woooooowww mind blowing. I love it so much on Blu-ray. Got it few weeks ago from Amazon. A must have if you are having a Blu-ray collection. Cheers.<br />Brazil D Uluwita.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Always needing a calculator and this one is so much faster than accessing one on my phone. Will be using this one often.
B00CSYRHG6|4|As a long time Ghibli fan, I was delighted to see this finally come out on blu-ray state side. The story of these high school students trying to save their club house is not as big and fanciful as some people may be looking for, but I really enjoyed it. The level of animation detail remains in all the nooks and crannies of the club house, sweeping cityscape shots, and the central characters are endearingly lovable. All in all a wonderful story told in a wonderful way.
B00BLCHYKU|5|Awesome!!!!
B007B5EDEG|5|OMG this book (and series) is one of the best reads I have had in a long time. I love a great story but love a great series too. This is well worth the read. Some very good writing and descriptive terms. I loved every page enough to find it hard to put down. Have since bought the DVD series and love love love it.
1590171993|4|Good, but not up to the fame
B00KM8TTQG|5|One of the greatest action movies of all time raid and the raid 2
B00B5AAW52|4|This is one of my all time favorite shows, so I had to buy it. The packaging is wonderful. Each season has it's own large DVD container inside the box. The box is square and easy to fit in a bookcase. My only complain is that the video quality isn't always the best. Sometimes the colors are off or dark colors look really speckly. It's a little distracting, but I'm overall pleased with the set. The new packaging does not have the problems of the old packaging, so buy away if that was your concern.
B00GTCECVG|5|I play this game every spare minute that I have of everyday. If you like strategy games you should definitely try this one out.
B003XF1XOQ|4|The only com I had with Mockingjay was it seemed like it was thrown together. The ending was amazing though and I would recommend it.
B00DA6YEKS|5|This book is too good. I continually red until my eyes burned and my head ached. The worst part about finishing it is that there isn't a sequel to immediately begin reading.
B000I5X80G|5|OK
B000EOTAM6|4|I'm not a heavy sci-fi fan, but I like a well-done futuristic film. Aeon Flux has the action, thought-provoking storyline and unique unfolding plot that kept drawing me into the film. Acting is top-notch, storyline is complex and fun to follow, and the action and special effects are superb. An excellent cast, twisting plot and even costumes will interest you until the very end. Well worth the watch.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Used to play this a long time ago. Fun learning it again. Mot as much fun as Spider Solitaire.
B0065GC0BA|5|This was a beautiful well written book. So emotive. A beautiful love story with so much depth. Gave me a new perspective on people with disability.
B000059T00|5|Once a \\"Classic\\" always a \\"Classic\\".....sure do miss those sixties.  I'm so bummed that my kids don't get to appreciate the music us babyboomers lived and breathed by!!  We're old but oh so very lucky!!
B00E8KLWB4|5|By far the best mystery game that I've found! Great puzzles and energy refill not bad; and the collections are rarely easy to get.
0062513346|5|This just may be my favorite book ever, and I read A LOT. I have read this book several times, and have given away at least 5 copies. I sold it from the shelves of my 'Angel Store' and my customers loved it too. Coelho writes with such a presence. He weaves the spritual story as the reader rides on the back of the words of the story. After writing this review, I think I will go and read it again. I think I just may be a Valkyrie. How about you?
B004EC5IUW|5|Mindblowing re boot on the original series,  defiantly worth the buy and the story telling isn't as intense as the original,  but the direction this takes is almost like going in a new direction and giving you something fresh.  must have for anime collector or fan of the anime series
0307588378|3|3 stars because I am approx. 60 pages into this story and it's borderline tedious. It's all &#34;window dressing&#34;, unimportant information for the most part. I don't care about the characters at all, the pace is very slow and nothing much is happening. I am tempted to not continue. Persuade me not to stop reading. Maybe the 3 stars is being generous, so convince me. Thanks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|My wife's coworker got her into this show just a couple weeks ago and she along with my two girls watched every episode with Prime. I've seen probably 80% of the shows and I was expecting a slow moving \\"soap opera\\". I was surprised that it is well written with many plots and sub plots that keep the story moving along. It also has plenty of antagonists and plot twists. Overall, I'd say it's no action flick and not for everyone but for me it boils down to a good story that it well acted. Finally, it is very well produced with elegant cinematography.
B00BD99JMW|5|I couldn't put it down. Each in the series gripped my attention drawing me deeper into the story, I didn't see what was coming and was surprised by ending but it makes sense, I would recommend this series for young and  old alike.
B005PDKVWY|5|Unfortunately, it is impossible for me to go see them live, this DVD is a great way to see them live
630469654X|5|This has been one of my most treasured movies, right up there with DR. Zivago, Lady & the Tramp, Dumbo.<br />I love this movie.
B000QI2ZWW|4|cute movie, makes me happy, just fun to watch.  can always use a smile, and this movie does that. verta
B005G5PPGS|4|Good book. All the calculations made baseball most interesting. There is no need to require length in my review. Done.
B000069HK2|2|I would like to say that this album is way overrated. I think its a horrible album. Something about this band, just don't sound right. There is something missing, maybe cathcy melodies. (the only song that is good is the taste of ink)<br />If you are looking to become a punk rock/emo/screamo fan, don't buy this. Buy bands like Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, Fairweather and Unwritten Law.
B00C8S9VKM|5|So many great stories about a time of change in American history. Well researched and explained. I can't recommend this book enough.
B002VECM6I|5|This movie is just incredible!  I went in with high expectations and they were exceeded....a rare feat indeed.  The story is both inspirational and funny; definately a movie for the entire family.  I was especially pleased that they kept the language relatively clean and the sexual content and violence to a minimum...a refreshing change!
B006ZAZ31U|5|One of the most inspirational books I've ever read. Adam Brown is a true American hero. Highly recommend this book.
B009RX8AQW|5|Excelente
B00TYB95I4|4|Awesome movie. Not really in to this type of movie about music, especially jazz, but this was an awesome movie.
B00FVVR2ZO|1|Finally, got two friends.  The first friend has been asleep from the start, the second friend is awake but when I click on them the game says do the update, it brings you to this page and when you click on it you get sent back to the game with no update. One star for the problems.
1439102430|3|Kathy Reichs has an impressive track record and she brings her expertise to her books. She also has an engaging cast of characters and a plot convoluted enough to keep the reader guessing...sort of. Usually it works fine. Here however I felt short-changed. There is so much technical stuff and so much information about the topography of Canada and the problems of some native Canadians that the story itself has to shrink to accomodate all these details. At a guess, 40% Temperance and her fellow characters and 60% data. It tends to get tedious at times. Also I have a problem with one detail (spoiler ahead!). How come neighbors etc never felt anything wrong when decomposition started? Not once, but twice?<br />Still I guess I shall buy the next book....
B00O0MBJPO|2|Sad as i used to be a big fan of Garths... i only like 1 song on this entire CD. Sorry to say but his singing days are probably over.
B00EJKG5M4|5|Simple to learn, easy to play and - once you get the hang of it - even most of the levels in the hardest pack should require less than a minute to solve. You get 3 stars if you can complete using the minimum number of moves, but you'll pass anyway provided you have not made more than three extra moves (each extra move deducts one star). And if you're stuck, there's a solution for each level to walk you through.<br /><br />The basic gameplay is identical to the free game Zyan Drench, but this game offers more &amp; different challenges. The graphics are simple; not particularly attractive but it'll do. The music is not exactly my cup of tea, but I could always lower its volume independent of my device's volume settings, or turn it off altogether.<br /><br />This pro version requests network access, and has an ad component in it (presumably carried over from the free version but deactivated). Given access to the internet, I only saw it connect to Amazon, and I saw no ads at all inside the game; anyway, it runs fine even with internet access denied.<br /><br />I finished the first, easiest pack (20 levels) very quickly (since I've played similar games before) and encountered no crashes or freezes but, since no two devices are the same, the only way to know whether it will be trouble-free for you too is to test it yourself. ;)
B00LG6UB9C|5|:)
B000FCKGPC|5|This book is yet another intricately woven story that adds more suspense to the series. Unsurpassed character development and detail.
B006OT03BM|5|I loved the transformer movies. This set is golden and wouldn't be around long. It is the mother of all collector editions for any transformer fan.
B009DJB8I2|5|good!
B0046B8GEQ|5|kids liked it
B00I8H6MGS|5|Even though this movie took too many liberties with the truth, it was enjoyable.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I was looking for a basic calculator for my Kindle. Calculator Plus Free more than met my requirements and expectations. A must have.
B008HTQ28K|5|Fantastic story probably his best for a long time, I have enjoyed all John Grisham's books that i have read,
B000089RVX|3|This c.d. was a great reminder of why I don't listen to or buy music that I first hear on the radio.  A couple of really powerful songs with deep emotional core, and then... boredom.  Boring guitars, melodies, drums, the piano is okay.  Really, it just boils down to her voice (I gave it three stars because it's such a great voice), but other than that, it isn't very exciting. Maybe if they had a guitarist who dared to even attempt a decent solo.  For my money, find a song by From Autumn To Ashes called Short Stories with Tragic Endings, a million times better than anything this band ever did
B00H71PBQ8|5|I like the first two seasons better.  Season four does not have the character development the previous episodes have.  The plot is somewhat contrived and sometimes weak. But I do love a history drama.
B00MBEF1G6|5|This app is so awesome because it allows you to take care of an adorable little turtle baby who you get to hatch I'm only 8 but I totally think you should get it and it's free.&eth;
B0009A40ES|5|I rented this recently on Netflix, and immediately came to Amazon to purchase it.  This is one of those movies that you should own.  It is so entertaining.  I wouldn't recommend it for kids...obviously!  But if you like a mind-bending movie, buy this.
B00E5Q1HJS|4|Predictable but good
B00OH74BXY|4|Pretty good movie. Glad to see Wolverine!
B002QE3CTY|5|Excellent book! Awesome series.
B00BETX5PS|4|Great story line...highly enjoyable!

B000002N25|5|'Golden Heart' is one of those albums that is rarely far from my stereo despite having it in my music collection for many years. It blends perfectly Knopflers voice, songwriting abilities and awesome guitar playing into one heavenly package. From the beautiful opener 'Darling Pretty' to 'Golden Heart' via the upbeat and fun 'Cannibals' and taking in the mournful melancholy of 'Rudiger' this album delivers so much emotion on one CD it almost demands repeated listening. The closing solo on 'Are We in Trouble Now' still gives me goosebumps even now and shows just how much power this album has. Knopflers later solo albums were hit and miss, but this one set the standard so high it was always going to be difficult to live up to it and this is the Knopfler album I keep coming back to. With searing beauty and lyrics that will leave you breathless, this is one CD I'll happily recommend above many others.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B008ASLK8A|1|I paid for this item and it did not download!<br />There was no way for me to get my money refunded.
B00CLD65X0|5|Phenomenal series! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to everyone watching them all.  I can't wait to catch up to the current season.
B00A6CCF0K|5|One of King's best books...great story that keeps your attention and makes you never want to put it down.  Characters are iconic complicated, full of life King characters!  Recommend even if you aren't a Stephen King fan and even if you never read the Shining...but if you did read the Shining makes it that much better!  Was not disappointed.
B00C7KXUOE|3|Decent television to watch while folding laundry
B007VUA7VO|5|It tells me how long my device will last with the power it has and it tells me how long it will take to charge at the rate it is charging.
B000ZM1FXO|1|No self respecting person could sit through this entire piece of garbage. One or two recognizable actors does not make a movie watchable.
B00881VLCE|5|I am hooked on puzzles and this one has great pictures and is very easy to use! the colors are so vibrant as well.
B0093H8HXS|5|My son purchased this item and it works great in his new computer console. We bought protections to be safe.
B0074D3CAQ|5|This is a most enjoyable story. It is well written and keeps the reader very interested in Harold's journey. I especially liked reading about his life through his travels and intertwined with his wife's story.
B00A9X9TIW|4|Pretty cool movie except I dozed off for a bit in the middle, probably just tired. But the rest kept me entertained
B00BSBR9N6|5|Very funny. Fast reading. Love the characters.
0767903854|5|This book is great!  I don't think I have ever laughed as much while reading a book.  I have had to close the book and compose myself just so I could continue!  Really, Bill Bryson writes an excellent book.  Besides all the laughter, you learn some very interesting things along the way about Australia's history, flora, fauna, people, etc. etc.  If you get a chance, grab a copy of this book and settle in for a wonderful read.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5|Takes you through the history of one of the most famous recording studios.  Full of great music.  Great soundtrack. Excellent film.
B000FQJAIW|5|Our grandkids could identify every character from Star Wars but never saw the movie.  The original release can be absurdly expensive so I was delighted to find this under &#34;used&#34;.  It came in what appeared to be the original wrapping and played perfectly.
0316055433|5|Loved the novel and although 763 plus pages, couldn't put it down.  I was happy to hear it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.
B002QE3CTY|4|The Maze runner was a book I just could not put down. It is a marvelous, thought provoking read.  James Dasher smartly created a dark and scary world with a precious bit of hope mixed in. I cant wait to begin the next book in the trilogy. These books are a must read and you can share them with a child in your life and that is the real magic!
B0012GMW0C|3|Not many of the Journey must have songs.  I prefer the Greatest Hits and the new Eclipse cd! Journey RULES!
B00HTYTQ5A|5|I had to go to PBS website to watch this program.  I would have loved to watch movies and stuff via Amazon but those are the breaks you have limited your audience.
B006XF5BTG|5|Love it. If you're looking for something to make a quick change than this is it. Follow it and stick to the eating plan.
1439181780|5|This book changed my life
B00FATEJYE|5|Fun game also awesome that each card has its own energy bar less time waiting more time playing thanks WB
B004Q7CIFI|5|Absolutely amazing book!!! I have read almost all of his books and this one ranks in the top three!!!!  Stephen King you are definitely the best!!!
B001AJVR5M|5|Fast shipping and great packaging.  My daughter loved this!  She has been a fan of the Jonas Brothers for several years and was not disappointed!
B00B23O96A|3|Eric's voice still strong.  As far as the songs, I only really liked &#34;Born to Lose&#34; and &#34;The Folks Who Live On The Hill&#34;.  I'll consider ordering one of his older CDs.
B002NN5F7A|2|Glengarry Glen Ross wasn't my cup of tea.  I still don't understand why the management was withholding those &#34;premium leads&#34;.
B00JBV28NQ|5|This was a Christmas gift for my father-in-law and he has listened to it many times since her received it and it was delivered on time!
B00DV2D0JC|1|Have a Nexus 7 FHD and it stops within seconds of the splash screen. I am on Lolipop
B003UYUP58|4|Great book.  Reads like a detective story in parts and very informative.  Sometimes gets bogged down in medical jargon that can be hard to follow.
0515153656|5|This was the first Lee Child book I had read and I loved it. I had departed from this genre for a spell and was caught up in Koontz and King (both fantastic), but I truly enjoy this genre and Child does a fantastic job with the Jack Reacher character. I want more!
B007A4SDCG|5|FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS A SWIFT KICK IN THE PANTS.... this was made for you!!!! I highly recommend this book!
B00688628M|5|Great mini series about the brave men who fought a war, and survived it. Not only survived it but made a life upon return to their homes!
B004A2V3K0|5|it's Bon Jovi! Of course it's great! Easy download, good sound. Not much else to say. . . . .
B00IJE1C1K|5|Growing up watching old westerns, I of course became a fan of the Duke. I have a collection of many of his movies. What collection would be complete without McClintock? Absolutely love this movie! I've read many different reviews on this particular one and found it disturbing that so many were negative concerning the video quality. I have an older DVD of this movie ( by Good Times Home Video )and it too would have received the same treatment. Terrible video quality! The ISBN number is 0-7662-0154-6 in case that means something to purchasers. I do not like dragging others down in their efforts but I also dislike people getting &#34;taken&#34;. Don't waste your money! This BluRay version however is of excellent quality and would not hesitate to recommend it as a great purchase. Enjoy!
1451648537|5|Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs is a fantastic read, both engaging and revealing in many details. What emerges is a portrait of a genius -- but also a quirky person with many contradictions.  On one hand, the visionary who brought us the Mac, the iPhone, the iTunes Store and many other exceptional innovations but also the taskmaster who was incredibly demanding and difficult to interact with -- someone who would get upset at the smallest details.  Of particular interest to fans of Apple products: there are many tidbits on how particular features (and bugs) got included -- from the oval on the MacIntosh dialogue boxes to the band circling the iPhone 4. There is also much revealing information on how the CEO of a huge public company concealed his cancer from so many people and about the intricate boardroom interplay deposing a leader and then his comeback.  Altogether, a great read that I would recommend to anyone.
B004RSCWZ2|5|Great
B0052UZIFA|1|Love the game on PC.  Doesn't work on my Viewsonic gTablet running TnT Lite 4.4.  I get a not responding message after about a minute of blank screen.  It doesn't even get to the popcap splash screen.<br /><br />I see on the androidtablets.com forums other people have same problem regardless of the rom that's installed.<br /><br />I should have googled for problems before download.  Maybe popcap will fix it?
B0001GOH6Q|5|This is the best movie for the last 10 years. It has a lot of meaning on each scene. I watched many times.
B005LAIHZY|4|It's well made, well written but can me scary for kids. The mom is turned into a bear and is tied up and nearly killed making her fight her father to protect her mother. This movie I wouldn't recommend to anyone under nine.
B00ATDOVNK|4|I have purchased G5 games before and loved to play but $4.99 is a little much that is why I'm giving only 4 stars instead 5 .
B00MUCX6AW|5|I loved it!  Yes, it is very similar to Goundhog Day ... same kinda theme going on.  And, it is a VERY long movie; so some editing could have been done in places to make it better.  But, the acting was great, most of the time I was on the edge of my seat and there is some great humor when needed when it is too serious.  And, the special effects are great!  I would watch it again.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Its nice ....
B00HDMMISA|5|I loved this book.  I thought it was much better than her previous book, The Husband's Secret.
0671042858|5|This is a great book, I've read it twice and found it very enjoyable. Trisha is a character whom you feel sympathy and attachment for. The experiences she goes through to survive in the wilderness for days on end is quite extraordinary, and at times, chilling. Just because of a simple mistake which brought her there. Scary thoughts and senses, which she feels (and knows) she's being watched and stalked... Whatever it is, is just waiting... Lurking. But what's out there that knows of her presence? Tom Gordon is the only man keeping Trisha feeling sane, yet is not there in person. So if you're a baseball fan, you will appriciate the layout and storyline even more. This novel is a page turner that will leave you on your heels until the very end.

B00IUBM8PQ|5|The sequel is every bit as good as the original.  Looking forward to the next installment.  Go see this movie.
B007L5KT76|5|good action.as good as the first.very entertaining.glad it had original cast.professor moriarty was a good villain in this film.must see.

B00CBKLO52|2|Just a simple program-slow
B0054R6BFM|5|So powerfull. Shows how little things can pile up to make a huge problem. Strongly recomend it. I have never read a better book. Changed my life. Please read.
B00005QZ7U|5|A movie that totally engulfs you: you laugh, you cry, the music is amazing.  It took the flu for me to finally see this movie.. i had seen clips and pieces here and there and never thought I could sit through the entire thing.. Im so glad i did.  All of the cast is wonderful.. the music is beautful, and the story is timeless.  If you love great broadway plays, you will admire this greatly.  If on broadway, this would be my new favorite.  Kidman is great, macgregor is equally great, and the supporting cast is marvelous.  This is a definate MUST SEE just due to the fact it is not your typical movie, but a journey into music and acting.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4|Upgrade your terreria so that you can put mods and other texture packs in the game. Like the computer version this can get you a lot of money
B004ECDNJU|5|A good game for the whole family because the speed is adjustable to very slow for the little ones.  A good buy if you've got several tablets in the family.
B00HT2RTU6|5|Brilliant film. Could have used some extras though.
B000002L80|5|\\"Little Creatures\\" is one of my favorite Talking Heads CD, not because it's so much better than the others, but because it is so different.  Its catchy melodies and lyrics edge the group closer to a pop sound than the punk roots that gave us \\"Psycho Killer\\" and \\"The Book I Read.\\" The hilarious inanity of earlier albums is downplayed here for a more mature, though hardly serious, take on life.  It addresses the lives of their fans as they grew older with the Heads--having children, jobs, and lives that still did not make complete sense.  \\"Creatures of Love\\" has a twang reminiscent of country western music, but with Byrne singing, it becomes mournful; the lyrics talk of having children:  \\"Little creature of love/With two arms and two legs/From a moment of passion/Now they cover the bed.\\"  The catchy \\"Stay Up Late,\\" a song about two kids who want desperately to wake up their baby sibling to \\"make him stay up all night,\\" portrays exactly the opposite of what parents would want.  \\"The Road to Nowhere\\" begins with the melodic strains of a chorus, then shifts into an electronic beat as the Heads reflect on lives that are not quite working out.  This CD is a must-have for all Talking Heads fan, even those who prefer the New Wave and African-influenced albums. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000A6CLL0|5|the best Star Trek show.
B002MQYOFW|4|having just seen the movie, decided to read the book since they are always better. this was no exception. looking forward to reading the next book on the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5|It's a fun game for kids and teenagers like myself .... and  I love despicable me it's the best movie ...
B00LXLM05I|5|Fun game bro
0446677450|5|Great book! Another good book that helped me tremendously was the one at [...] I wish amazon sold the book from there. It was called Best Financial Planning Book and was the absolute best book on financial planning that I've ever read. Hope that helps someone.
0307891372|5|I bought this guide a few weeks after buying the game, and I can tell you now that I wish I had it from the start. This guide has great references for when you start out, as well as good walkthroughs for quest without giving too much away. I already recommended this to 3 of my friends who play, and they all had the same opinions as I did.
0345525558|5|Everyone has explained the book so eloquently and all I have to say is I have never written a review for a book, but this book is just absolutely magnificent and I could hardly put it down once I started reading it. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun
B005LAIHYU|5|Talk about putting a spin on HISTORY.  I loved the way everything tied together, and the special effects were Great!
B00ES250W4|5|The book has been given negative comments due to the graphic sex. However, the story is about the psychological unraveling of a man's sexual style learned when he was a teen which has affected his understanding of love and has crippled his ability to have personal relationships.  The actual story hinges on the rebuilding of his emotional psyche to embrace  love on a personal level and later a family level. It is well written and insightful.
0425180638|4|I tend to read what other reviewers say especially when their opinions differ from my own, and I want to know why. When I went to get something 'good' to read (usually means a mystery to get my mind off of my daily grind), Cornwell's book was on the number 1 reading list for almost all of the major media. Since most of the reviews written on Amazon.com are predominantly negative...this presents a conundrum. Are the reviewers wrong or are all the people who are purchasing and reading this book wrong?<BR>Granted, Cornwell's protagonist has been getting 'stale'. As is typical with long-running series the author seems to be having problems with making her plots and characters diverse enough to please everyone. After her last book in this series, I wasn't sure I was going to read her again. But I figured all those people buying this very thick addition to her series couldn't all be wrong. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was right. Cornwell seems to have gotten a second 'literary wind' and the book makes for good reading. A lot of loose ends are tied up in this chapter of Scarpetta's life, with the truth about Benton's death finally coming to some type of conclusion. I have yet to read a mystery series where at some point, both the author and the protagonist runs out of 'gas', and where the stories do not seem to be familiar or lack the excitement of the first few books in the series. Even Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes had major problems at the end...Doyle tried without much luck to get rid of his alter ego/protagonist, but ended up having to ressurect him because of the outcry. The same thing happened when Cornwell tried writing a book considerably different from her usual. Readers and critics cannot have it both ways, and perhaps they should cut Cornwell some slack?<BR>Cornwell still has brought the genre one of its best and most interesting protagonists. Her writing and the intelligence of her plots are still way above par, and she deserves recognition for teaching the public about a field of expertise that was not well-developed prior to Scarpetta's entrance on the scene (forensic science). ....
B006GLLXXK|5|Love it from the beginning, dark love story with magic thrown in.<br />I hope the saga continues on, all the characters are so believable.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Pretty fun and again it's not fair bored but that ok cause us kids like it also it's sort fun!
B0087JTAKW|4|I don´t read a lot of novels that do not have a strong education value intertwined into the story line (for example, a story based around actual science or historical facts) but I grabbed this book for a flight from the US to Iceland and it did not disappoint. It tells the story of father time, how he came to be and how he plays out his life and in the process tries to emphasize the worth of time in a rather magical story. Short, easy read that´s good for killing time (pun intended) such as in a long flight.
B00BGZ8OLA|3|It is true this movie is a work of art.  The visuals are stunning and beautiful.  I understood the movie and enjoyed it.  I purchased the movie as a possible book and film study for my high school seniors.  Not sure they will make it through the movie without falling asleep as there are many slow sections.  That being said, many of the slow parts are complemented with thought-provoking scenary and action.  That is part of the beauty and mystery of the movie.  I do not understand the many reviews saying this was a horror movie.  Horror, in film, is a lot different than a horrific life experience.  It is not a \\"horror movie\\".  As for the animals...one of the themes of the film is survival and also living on the planet with other species which God has created (all unique in their own way).  Animals eat one another in the wild and we eat animals too.  My domestic cats sitting here on the table beside me just ate their tuna and Fancy Feast, which, I believe still has meat in it.  If you watched this with your children and they cried all the way through...I don't believe you.  None of the scenes with animals eating one another were even slightly gruesome.  There was not any blood or carnage.  Reviewers, please know what you are talking about before you review...and focus on the story.  If you do watch this with your children...there is a lot you will need to explain to them.
B006LSZECO|3|I was about to give up on the book before Go's advice for a \\"Wooden Anniversary Present\\" on page 20.<br /><br />The book is readable and enjoyable.  The plot reminded me of a Stephen King novel.  The dual voice timeline reminded me of--everything published post-Lost, or Underworld (DeLillo).  The over-abundance of ironic references were a little boorish because they reminded me of David Spade.  On the whole, I would say the book is a wee bit derivative.  Although, using derivative as a criticism (just criticism, not a criticism, I learned that from Amy) is in and of itself....
0783114222|5|The praises of this series have been sung by others, and I heartily recommend this DVD to everyone, but I would like to make a few points, some of which are negative, but which don't detract from the immense value of this series.<br />(1) Without the development of the giant Saturn V Moon rocket, man never would have gotten to the Moon, and yet its development, unlike that of the Command Module and Lunar Module is not dealt with and yet its story was just as dramatic.  The problem of \\"combustion instability\\" and its solution is very interesting and took the lives of some excellent engineers but it is not mentioned.  It is interesting that Wernher von Braun, the head of this effort is barely mentioned or shown in the series, whereas he was a very visible P.R. man for the space program in the 1950's and 1960's.  I believe the producers of this series were aware of von Braun's past as a Captain in the dreaded Nazi SS and his possible (not proven) role in the war crimes involved in the production of the V-2 rocket in World War II and they didn't want to bring up this controversy.<BR>(2)  I give great credit to the producers for the episode about the development of the Lunar Module and the other episode showing how the astronauts were trained to become proficient geologists on the Moon.  Science and engineering are usually not interesting for the television viewer, and yet these things were made quite interesting.  My only complaint is that the engineers<BR>who worked on the Lunar Module are shown to be a bunch of lovable \\"nerds\\" who view the work as recreation, but in reality many engineers gave their lives as heroes, just as did the Apollo 1 astronauts, because of the immense stress due to the time pressure.  Others survived but had the marriages and family lives ruined.  None of this is really shown.<BR>(3)  The actors who played Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first two men on the moon, played by Tony Goldwyn and Bryan Cranston, put in especially superb performances.  Aldrin, the troubled genius, was especially well portrayed by Cranston who put in a lot of time studying Aldrin before filming commenced.<BR>(4)  The episode about Alan Shepard and Apollo 14 was quite good in showing how the flight controllers and the support teams led by Don Eyles overcame the Abort Switch malfunction.  Here real-time problem-solving was shown.  I was, however, disappointed that the Apollo 16 mission was not really shown because they had a more serious problem with the back-up Service Propulsion System which<BR>also had a problem and was quite solved in a similar way.  The Apollo 16 crew's exploration of the Descartes-Cayley site would have been quite interesting too because it was quite different than expected.<BR>(5)  The episode about the end of the program in Apollo 17 was both good and bad, the bad part being the story that Tom Hanks appears in about the filming of the early 20-th century movie about a flight to the Moon.  This was just a waste of time, in addition to the slander against Thomas Edison. There were more important things to show, in my opinion.  However, the end of the episode leaves me with tears in my eyes, because of all that had been accomplished in such a short time, and was then allowed to be thrown away because of short-sightedness.  I hope that the Presidents recent decision to go back to the Moon will be carried out because Mankind needs to look to the future and to continually expand his horizons.
B000001GQP|5|Great recording.
B00FKF0F3C|3|not as good as the first two--- had a hard time &#34;connecting/relating&#34; to the characters--- perhaps because the time period is/was part of my life and I knew what happened
B002S0OBMS|5|I think I love the songs in \\"Love Never Dies\\". They are beautiful in their own way.  It's not fair if we are going to compare \\"Love Never Dies\\" with \\"The Phantom of The Opera\\". That was best of the best.  But \\"Love Never Dies\\" is also great if you seperate it from \\"The Phantom of The Opera\\". The storyline is about 10 years pass, life move on, even the Phantom.  He have changed.  From the bitter genius who was denied by the society, now he is a great and powerful American citizen (I guess).  And by the way, the location is Coney Island, not a sophisticate French society.  Also it is the island that the \\"FREAK\\" can walk among men. Have you ever go to the freak show or circus, the environment must be fun, lively, colorful not the bitter, grumpy and dark relam underneath the opera house.<br /><br />So, forget about \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Love Never Dies\\" is different. Why else the place called \\"Phantasma\\"?. I think ALW should be praise for delivery the show this great.  Especially Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess and the rest of the casts and crews, it is fantastic job that they are doing.  For example \\"Look with You Heart\\", this song bring tear to my eyes (a lot) it is a song that mother try to comfort her dearest son that his father (Raoul) also love him even he is angry all the time.  And when it is reprised at the end of the show, it's telling the audiences to \\"Look With Your Heart\\".  It has a very complex meaning in so very simple words. Just only need us to listen carefully.<br /><br />And UMMMM WOW!!! \\"Beneath A Moonless Sky\\" - WOW!!!! That's HOT! HOT! HOT!. The song is so sexual, confession, passionate and ... so much more ... you can only imagine. The love flame grew hotter and brighter in every note that The Phantom and Christhine have been duet. WOW! WOW! WOW!<br /><br />That's all for my review and please \\"Look with your heart and not with your eyes. The heart can't be fool, the heart is too wise. Forget what you think, ignore what you hear. Look with your heart, it always see clear\\"ee clear\\"
B008AWBQGW|5|Based strictly on the strength of the songs and performances, this is one of skynyrd's best-certainly of the Johnny era-but holds up respectably w/ anything they've done.  Would it be better and/or sound more authentically skynyrd w/ Leon, Billy and you name the other departed/estranged former member, most likely.  However, it is stunning and showcases a band of die hards (and hired guns)who still care enough to make the best music they can.  For all the clowns that write it off w/o giving it any shot b/c every surviving member is not a part of the current band, get real.  How many girlfriends/wives from the '70's do you still talk to?  Try being married to 6 spouses-no way it can always work; not to mention the ones that time claims.  Setting that pointless argument aside, these songs deserve to be heard and savored-they are extremely well crafted and exquisitely produced-everything is mixed w/ power and the guitars are set on stun!!  If you have ever loved the band, this is a safe bet.  If you love southern rock, it's a safe bet.  I can recommend it w/o reservation. Skynyrd may have spent the last 20+ years relying too heavily on the same classics in the live shows, but they continue to offer proof that they can write and/or allign themselves w/ excellent writers and turn out bonafide ass kicking new product. There is no reason not to support this album w/ a purchase.

B00IIUATDM|3|Good but not but great.  A bit too much raunch and nude women!
B00002MZ2C|5|Rage Against The Machine is one of the few bands around who not only create excellent music, they also send a powerful message.  On this CD they explore the danger of letting the establishment control your thoughts,  while mixing the lyrics with enough great music to keep you rocking all  night.
0307730697|5|I read this book in just over 24 hours.  Having read many of the books about the military and Navy SEALs I must say that this one truly stands out as unique.  It is a completely candid view of Adam Brown's life, both good and bad.  He was not perfect and had his demons.  This book shows the reader a truly inspirational story and in so forces the reader to examine their own life and strive to be better.
B0031KC8OC|5|Moves quickly, great one liners, lots of &#34;before they were famous&#34; stars. One of the best season finales ever. Great!
B004XJRQUQ|5|Great Trilogy, realistic apocalyptic situation, and a great lesson about how absoulute power corrupts absolutly ! Actually there are a lot of lessons in this book that are true to todays life. Most of all though it is interesting, entertaining and a great read !
B0009XNUK0|5|I always love Jacksons music. he was a great singer and performer. No he was not a child molester, just a guy who never got a normal childhood and lived through the kids.

1400052173|5|This was a real page turner.  I still am amazed that the family of Henrietta Lacks do not have free medical insurance after their mother's cells were used in research about cancer.
B00BT70J7M|2|So much talked about and all the credits to his voice, but....<br />I heard him a few years ago on the Met, sadly I can´t even remember the name of the opera (either Puccini or Verdi) but his performance went totally unnoticed. By that time I handn´t heard a lot of him. But since his reputation has steadily climbed and I believe he is considered todays most shining tenor.<br />So it was with great expectations I sat down to listen to this album.<br />But the mans voice is not at all appealing to me; he sort of chokes on the words like he was having a hot potatoe in his mouth, his voice lacks the lyrical attributes and drama that constitutes a great tenor.<br />I´m sorry but in comparison to, for example, Villazon, he is not in the same league.<br />The man is extremely good looking but that doesn´t make his voice any better.<br />Now bear in mind that these words come from an amateur with no education whatsoever in singing techniques so please don´t pay to much attention to my opinion, but this one is not for me.
B00IG2DOKM|5|This game is amazing. You can harvest crops, build houses, factories and more!! This app is amazing. People that don't have it should get it. I rated this app full stars for one reason and one reason only. I rated it full stars because it is awesome. Take it from me, you should get this app if you don't have it. You should also listen to people that also think that this app is cool!!
B00005JKN9|4|that would be a great DVD feature for this movie. to totally remove the useless characters of Leo and Diaz. much like Titanic, his lack of cinematic charisma drags down what could have been a much better movie. the sets were gorgeous. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best anti-heroes in movie history.
B001RTP3YQ|5|This CD is absolutely wonderful!  Of course is Leonard Cohen.  We'd recognize this CD to anyone looking for quality entertainment.  Also the double CDs are both quite long and provide a lot of entertainment for the money. We highly recommend this one!
B007EC27QM|5|It works great, I am very happy with it! I have been using it for a few weeks and have had no problems with it.
B008Y6TOVI|4|Brilliant!
0439023483|5|THE HUNGER GAMES, by Suzanne Collins, was a fantastic and thrilling story of survival when all odds are against you. The world that Collins created in Panem was scary but completely possible. The government in the Capitol was corrupt but extremely powerful and willing to take out anyone who rebel against them.     The characters in this book were fantastic. Even the smaller roles, such as the other tributes, were a joy to read. I almost wanted to know more about these children before their untimely and unnecessary deaths. Katniss was an amazing choice as the POV. She was selfless and strong, and all she wanted was to support her family. But she ended up with the short end of the stick when she volunteered to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games. In the beginning, Katniss would do anything but conform to the rules of the Capitol, but she quickly learned that to survive in the Hunger Games she would need to put on a facade or she would not live. She did manage to stay true and honest to herself, which ended her in a precarious situation at the end.     The men in this book were so great. Gale, as Katniss' best friend and partner, was a strong and perfect gentleman and an obvious choice for Katniss. But Peeta, being thrust into the Hunger Games with Katniss, created another piece of the triangle that was equally tempting.    I was blown away by this book. The idea of the Hunger Games was inhumane and disturbing. The fact that this government went to such great lengths to punish the children of those who rebelled stirred powerful and hateful emotion in me while reading. I do appreciate the honesty and amazing creativity that Collins put into this book, and I cannot wait to continue this series.
B001LF3YQK|3|quality and ease of use wise, it's so-so only. not that fantastic. can live without it and just go for the normal baby wipes packaging.
B00J6YBOFQ|4|Thief details the difference between merely improving on the ideas of others and creating new ideas. While its valuable to refine others work, the real value is created via innovation. Value for the creators and society.
B0063IH60K|4|Great game! I really enjoy playing it while waiting whenever the opportunity presents itself. What more could you want besides maybe some type of music soundtrack playing in the background as a mood setter. I give it two thumbs up.
B002WY64HA|5|Arcade Fire quickly became one of my favourite bands not only because of their ambition (they play over 50 instruments on stage), but because every member of the band is so involved they could not work better together.  &#34;In the Backseat&#34; on repeat all day long.
B00EE3FVSU|5|I really liked this series.  Better than most.
B00HDMMISA|4|Not literary genius but certainly a very good story. I wouldn't call it fluff exactly because it has a great plot and I really enjoyed the character development. Recommended for sure
B00OKYQZDI|1|I enjoy thus game. What I don't enjoy Is the part where I buy an extra move to win the game and it restarts the game entirely and I have to start over. This has happened 4x. Waste of money! Thieves.
B005NFJAT4|5|With out a doubt, at least on this persons opinion, the best movie on Gettysburg ever. This should not be compared to a Ken Burns documentary because it is written as a story and meant for theater or TV.  That said you won't find a movie better scripted, filmed, acted or closer to the actual events and people involved at Gettysburg than this one.<br />Sit back and go back and be at the scene in Gettysburg July 1863, sweat in heat so humid and sweltering that even southerners couldn't stand it. Be part of the smell of death that fills the battlefield when it is finished.
B000MV8ZD6|5|When a family moves from New York City to a New England town where they found the perfect place to stay, however their young child has a psychic power that enables him to see a ghost that warns him of the terrible things that happened there once. Long ago, a mad scientist named Dr. Freudstein conducted horrific experiments on people as he murdered them in the basement and used them, now a curse brings him back to life as a ravenous murderous zombie that kills as he seeks new blood and more people to kill and experiment on with ghostly events happening.<br /><br />Ghastly, unique and stylish supernatural zombie/haunted house thriller from Lucio Fulci is one of his best movies yet. Sure it lacks coherence but this movie delivers dark atmosphere, great scares, gory sequences like the skull stabbing and Bat mutilation sequences, and a chilling music score. I love how this movie combines both the zombie and haunted house movie genres especially influence by HP Lovecraft into one movie thanks to the magic of Fulci whom also makes a cameo in this motion picture, this is one of my all time favorite scary movies ever and highly recommended for fans of the genres but not for the squeamish.<br /><br />This DVD is a re-issue of the Anchor Bay edition which has a great transfer and good sound with fine extras like an easter egg, TV Spot, Trailer, Bio of Fulci and poster-and-still gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"House (1986)\\", \\"The Others\\", \\"The Shining\\", \\"Re-Animator\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\", \\"City of the Living Dead\\", \\"Demons 1 & 2\\", \\"Evil Dead 1 & 2\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead (1978)\\", \\"Making Contact (a.k.a.

0061950726|5|Orphan Train was wonderful and informative about a time in our country's history that is basically unknown.
B00IINPXLW|1|it sucks
B00HDMMISA|4|Quick and easy read. Page turner with humorous and serious topics.
B00QR7ZM8A|4|Interesting change of pace for Dylan.  Great band and generally good tune selection (one or two might have been beyond his reach); overall a pleasant, but not earth-shattering experience.
B005HSL626|5|this is honestly a very good game.its fun free and addictive!I love the background and different swords you can get. this game ks GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5|I LOVE DAIRY OF A WIMPY KID!BEST BOOK EVER!I WOULD BUY IT! WORTH THE MONEY! IF YOU LIKE TEENS BUY!
B00ECU2SGS|3|A man and a boy.......two fools for love.  Two fools ready to ruin their lives for a woman.  A disappointing romance.  A disappointing movie.........horrible ending. The actors and the area in which the movie was staged, made it mildly entertaining........the writer should be fired.
B00DRPVE3M|5|This game shared with me, the love of uno. Thank you for giving me that feeling.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I ride on the 1st night!
B001QWBM62|5|I love it. There is no more explanation needed.<br />It produces the best recording ever. It is super handy, portable so you might think the quality is down but no.<br />I sent all my universities audition tapes with this mic. It really captures your sound very well.
B000NTPDSW|5|Godfather I & II are classics - and I had never seen III. I thought I'd take advantage of a $17/set in BR. Had to send the first two sets back because III wouldn't read - and I had never seen it. The 3rd set read fine - unfortunately - what a turkey of a movie. The great copy of The Godfather (I) was worth the price - and five stars.
1491526513|5|Let me preface this by saying this is my first review ever after being an Amazon customer for many years. I never felt compelled to write a review until now. That's how much I loved this book.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for space stories, disaster stories, and characters with humor and tenacity that are super relatable. Despite Mark Watney's vast engineering and botany knowledge, despite the science and math jargon, this character was relatable and someone you rooted for from his very first profanity laden sentence. Mark was my kind of protagonist.<br /><br />The pacing of the story is perfect and I love the switch of point of view as it kept things interesting. Just as you think you would grow a bit weary of the log entries, the next chapter switches up right on time.<br /><br />Andy Weir keeps you on the &#34;edge of your seat&#34;, keeping the suspense consistent and dropping obstacles when you least expect it.<br /><br />You best believe I will be in the theater when this movie comes out. I haven't been this excited to see a film since Gravity.<br /><br />A plusses all around!
B000EMGAOY|4|This album maybe be a little too mellow, but it still has some of the fast songs that we all enjoy from the Chili Peppers. I was disappointed that many of the songs weren't very loud or in your face rock.  INstead there are alot of mellow chill out songs.  The few loud songs are very good, but the lack of the in our face rock gives this album a 4 outa 5.
B004KRVDDM|5|I looove this movie for it's delightfully quirky characters as well as its gentle, satiric take on small-time competitions and the big-time impact they have on contestants, families, and communities. The undercurrent of predictability is off-set by the deliciously bizarre characters and the interesting situations. You'll fall in love with every one of the supporting cast and the leads as well. And the dancing is phenomenal!
B00VRYCGLO|5|I like,this game.
B006MW3V6U|5|This series has an outstanding story line, incredible photography, and wonderful attention to the &#34;period&#34; details.  Don't wait to absorb the entire season!
B009UZLRJE|5|Love this show, it is very funny! The actors and writers have done a great job to make this show great. I never watch comedy because it usually isn't very well done but this show is different. Thhe characters work well together to bring out the &#34;funny&#34; the writers have laid out. I tend towards geeky so I can relate to many of the references. Do yourself a favor and enjoy!
B002UNMWAG|5|This is a very good product and I would recommend it to anyone, always shop at amazon to get the better price!
B0042KZJ5K|5|lovely cd. exactly what i hoped for and was what my husband asked for. definitely worth the wait. we are enjoying it
B00IVDXAN2|5|What a great idea! Adalyn loved them!
B00A6CCF0K|5|Excellent
B00EEL0LGY|5|To bad i need more words, graphically flawless of course i have a quad.core G2 phone i am on this with.  Excellent replayability, upgrade your ski, buy new ones and rip up the water.  Great job Vector Unit productions.
B002NZTZ8S|5|Great family film for Santa Clause
B00395ZYVS|5|Truly a well developed story.  The characters are alive and an emotional connection is readily made.  And a story that should be told...
B0054R6BFM|5|This book is very intriguing. This book made me get tears in my eyes in several different parts of the story. I loved learning the story of Hannah Baker. I felt like I was in the story, and that I experienced everything with Hannah. This book is just amazing.
0375507256|5|I think this book is a masterpiece. I don't normally care for science fiction but that isn't really what this is. It combines intellectual ideas, historical commentary, a deep grasp of literary genres and a style that is SO readable you can't put it down, even when you thought you weren't very interested in reading about how music is composed, or what missionaries were up to.  At times it was funny, at other times moving, and always enthralling. I am so grateful to my sons for getting me to read it.
B004W1GCNC|4|Despite the fact that there are only three episodes, this series is lovely. As a devotee to \\"Downton Abbey\\", I can't seem to get enough of the aristocracy and their relationship with the help. Characters don't have time to be well developed in only three episodes however, while Downton Abbey was on hiatus, it was a great way to soothe my cravings.
B0063IH60K|5|I've had Solitaire for quite awhile....and I've had other solitaire games but I always come back to this one version.  It's always a challenge and fun.  It plays fast and you can play anytime.  I keep it on my favorite list so I can bring it up for a quick game.
0736696954|1|Between the stereotyped characters, the clunky narration, the errors in technical fact, and the lack of any sense of suspense there is much not to like here. The quality of the narration does not, unfortunately, do enough to redeem the material.
B00J6YA1V4|2|Very disjointed.Almost quit reading several times.The number of characters was overwhelming.The first several chapters read like a collection of short stories.
B00FATEJYE|4|This game is so awesome I love how it has great graphics and its easy at first but it gets harder and harder as you go I recommend if you love fighting games you download this game I played it and I was hooked I can't stop playing its awesome.
B007SOQBCM|5|This is excellent cause I stream destiny and other games on the Xbox 1 so this is great to check out my streams to see what's wrong or if everything's good
B009JBZH54|1|Watch out, don´t have the movie The Dark Knight Rises, instead include two same disk of special features of the this movie.  It`s unbelievable. Because I live in Colombia can´t back the product.<br /><br />Cuidado, esta versión de cinco discos no tiene la tercera parte de la saga, en lugar trae dos discos repetidos de las características especiales, como vivo en Colombia no me es rentable devolver el producto.
B00G24KKAS|3|It's sad to say that season 4 is a bit disappointing for me.<br />But it already started in the last episodes of season 3. I guess it's because Glen Mazzara left TWD.<br />There is no tension anymore. New Characters die to early so you don't really care. e.g. The first episode of the new season would have been at least 2 or 3 episodes on the old seasons. The pace is too high. There is one event after the other. So there is no time used anymore for character development.<br />I hope they reduce the pace again, because the series is still very well done.
B007MC8YLQ|4|I'd never played Freecell before and found this game quite enjoyable. I had purchased Brainium Solitaire and thought I'd try this. The only thing I wish it did was keep the stats; mine go away every time I power down the Kindle Fire. Other than that, great game!
B000002UHG|4|The main reason I got this one is because it was by one of the members of Pink Floyd and I need to keep my collection fairly complete.  Its not a bad album but it doesn't compare to any of the Floyd works.  If you liked Wet Dream, you should like this one.
B00B2JSRAS|5|If you are a natural skeptic, like me, you may find this book a refreshing challenge to your persistent way of thinking. Using real-world actions Pam Grout had made me, not just a believer in the possibilities of thinking a NEW way, but she has caused me to move belief into immediate action. This makes ALL the difference!
B00IKZX1ZI|5|OMG... I love playing this game with my 5year old granddaughter. It's one of our favorite games to play together.
0884271536|5|The content of this book works. It is one of the best business books around. You can understand what the author is saying. It's a book you can read and use rather then put on your shelf. If you read the review below  which gives this book only one star you will see that the author of that  review is in a competative business to Dr. Goldratt and his followers. His  low rating is SELF-SERVING and a dishonest presentation. Why not tell us up  front that you are competing with TOC. There is room for everyone with out  this kind of low and nasty attack.
B000066C1N|3|the soundtrack is good and all but i want the song from the trailers. some female girl singing, i really love that song! If anyone knows where to find it, the name, singer, or anything about it please make a review about it. I really need to know!
B005DKLPF6|5|took a couple of listens to discover the depth of this latest masterpiece, and well worth it. this album and blood mountain are my top two favorite mastodon albums.
B0091REZMW|4|Seems to go on forever.. it's fun while new rooms are unlocked.. after a while, finding stuff becomes mechanical.. sometimes missing out on rewards due to time limits is annoying..
B005S9ELY4|5|This is a really good movie gives you action drama and suspense not an all time great but very good movie
B004HW7JI8|5|Good price. Good package. Cheaper here then anywhere I've seen. I like this show so I enjoyed this purchase. PLL!
B0054JZC6E|5|I love this app. its so so so so so so so so so so fun.best app orshould I say apps!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4|interesting and unique plot grappling with challemgimg concepts. i would have liked to spend a little more time with Laurie. some components were dragged out but hen carried little significance to the story such as the female teenager in the beginning and the character development of Patzs other victim and that guys mother. i think this interesting storline could have been developed and delivered more quickly. but i still enjoyed it.
B00BAXFECK|5|One of the best book I have read recently.  Has a perfect ending!
B0000B3FCX|5|Not as good as there last studio album Silver Side Up, but still good music. Someday is the standout track and Nickelback proves that they are not a one-album wonder. Good work by the Canadians.
B00CATSONE|3|It was quite short, but informative.  I assume there is not much information about him because of the efforts to silence him.
B001GUXJQA|5|This book was so well thought through with many facts and places that I recognized.  The scenic and action descriptions were well thought out and presented in a smooth and flowing read.  The ending chapters were very cleverly done.  I am sure the editors cut out too much.  They always seem to.  I had a hard time putting the book aside (as I am supposed to be working) and was just hoping it could have been much more to it.<br />Don't stop with these great books.
B000NQRE9Q|5|Perfect!!!
B00338QENI|3|Have not finish reading it I will update my review when I am done reading the book I previously made a mistake I though I finished it and it was that the loan of the book expired
B000HEWEDK|5|I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE DVD. PRICE WAS GOOD AND IT WAS SHIPPED AND DELIVERED QUICK.
B009X01ELC|3|Case is sturdy and functional.  However, the elastic closing strap shredded with normal use in under a year.  Instead of one strap, it now has multiple elastic strings around it.  Very frustrating to unhook separate strings to open/close it.  Guess large rubber bands or some sort of elastic from sewing box will work.  (Maybe cut the top off of some old shorts.)  For what it costs, some better closing system should be developed.
B002SAUCBC|3|I am a huge Stephen King fan, but this was just ok.  The long walk was a long read, but I do enjoy King's writing style and ramblings.  I plodded along with the walkers hoping for something or anything to happen.  It didn't.  There was very little back story here, so I had many questions like &#34;what kind of world is this or time in the world where these long walks are carried out?&#34; or &#34;What is the point of the walks?&#34;, &#34;What are the prize terms for the winners?&#34;, and most importantly, &#34;What the hell happened at the end?!&#34;
0399226907|5|This is the board version. It is a smaller, sturdier book with the same great story for the little ones.
B007EZJKS2|4|The Last Unicorn is a lovely marriage of the book and the movie. Its illustrations are largely based on the movie animation, though the humans are mostly \\"toned down\\" so that they are recognizable but less caricaturised. Also, it adds back in a part of the plot and some small details that the movie left out. I do prefer Amalthea's look in the movie to the book, and of course the movie has a few things that they couldn't translate so much into the book, like the songs. Gorgeous.
B000HKW7E0|5|who's ever put christmas into a better and more realistic light than the makers of this film? it is a masterpiece!
B00CL0J99K|5|The Iron Man Series is fantastic! Although I was never a fan of Robert Downey Jr., he is perfectly cast as Iron Man (and as Sherlock Holmes in his recent movies). Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle complete a superb ensemble cast. I am eagerly waiting for Iron Man IV and the next Avengers installment.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|My scor I got to is 123
B000AAF1U4|5|Thanks.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like this game a lot. Not sure what I am doing but like it. Keeps trying to figure it all out.
B008A1NKTO|5|this  movie is  awesome the true heroes that defend the country as a former marine  i salute them all  as well civilian and  Paramedic, fire dept  as well as civilian , and  military Medic who also  are heroes in fighting  disease, crime, etc in this world  we all  must unite  to make  not our country better but our own  home town neighbor .
B0011EVSGE|5|My 5 and 6 year old loved it- they were mesmerized by the wonderful inventions and even the singing and dancing! I wish more of today's movies would use this type of creativity to evoke such delight in life! Good clean fun!
B006MW3UZW|5|An excellent series and so easy to access!
B000H6SXMY|5|If you like Friends you like Friends, so whatever. The point though- this is a waaaay cheaper choice than buying the individual seasons. Really smart buy.
0385733577|5|What a great piece of fantasy escapist fiction that is steeped in mythology.  So much more intriguing and intellectually fascinating that way than the Harry Potter books.  And to think that this Flavell character actually lived--or is it lives?  Take this one to the beach, to the cabin, into the garden with you for a perfect way to spend a summer afternoon or evening reading.  And if you must, share it with your kids!
B003UESJH4|5|The life on times of British Royalty is always interesting.  This movie tells the story of Britain's King during World War II, George VI (played by Colin Firth).  \\"Bertie\\" as the King was known to his family was a conscientious member of the Royal Family who had a terrible stutter.  His speeches were a trial for himself and those listening.<br /><br />This movie tells how Bertie controls his stammering with the help of his speech therapist.  The interplay between the low-born Australian Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and the king is heartwarming and entertaining.<br /><br />This is an inspiring movie that has two interesting story-telling ways.<br /><br />First:  The story focuses on Bertie overcoming his speech impediment, not anything else.  During the lead-up to the climactic scene, the various functionaries in the British Empire, the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and others all support the plot tension that the King must make the most important speech of his career-Great Britain's declaration of war against Germany.  As the king approaches the microphone, he doesn't get any re-assurances from Churchill that the RAF will keep off German Bombers-the script is written with the focus on the fact that he must deliver a rousing speech.<br /><br />Second:  The reigning King/Dynasty in Britain seem to align with the poets and playwrights.  This script treats the coup of \\"The Establishment\\" and King George VI against his older brother King Edward VIII as a natural, by-the-right occurrence.  It is remarkable that the play Richard III treats the defeat of King Richard by Henry Tudor as the same sort of a thing.  The play Richard III is alluded to in this movie also.
B0057R5XRG|5|Although this is such an old movie, the experience about watch it again was amazing. The roar from the dinosaur, the trembling of T-Rez's footsteps gave my home theatre system a worthwhile experience.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend getting this classic movie!<br /><br />Another classic movie to recommend is &#34;Matrix: The Ultimate&#34; at the following link:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPPBEQ?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B000OPPBEQ&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&=movies-tv&qid=1402914446&sr=1-6&keywords=matrix
B0054R6BFM|4|Innocence lost...hope lost...life lost.  Such a compelling, raw and emotional read from the voice of a deeply broken girl.  It shows you that one semi harmless act can create a dangerous 'snowball effect'.  I felt completely helpless reading this book because we all know Hannah DID commit suicide, and that there would be no 'knight in shining armor' moment.  To hear her isolation and how easily 'the signs' (her cries for help were ignored) by everyone...piers...family...teachers.  I see the future that she gave up on breaks my heart to know that this happens and there were things that could have been done to stop the downward spiral if 'we' would just take our eyes off of ourselves. I like the double narrative...seeing the same moment from 2 perspectives simultaneously.  On such a serious topic I like the 'end game' message of this story.  I cannot say that I enjoyed this book, but feel enlightened and humbled by it.  Definitely worth the read.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|My granddaughter love it
0307887898|5|The Lean Startup by Eric Ries is a great book for learning how to start a company and keeping that company. It outlines all the ways for a business to continually test their product innovations and determine the corret direction to go in. Many of these environments to set up to allow for A/B testing and split testing are easy to set up and provide invaluable feedback to the changes that you make. I highly recommend this book for anyone who feels there business is plateau'ing.
1594633665|5|I loved this book....it was suspenseful, enjoyable.........
B00CT2P6VA|5|The music that plays as you work on the games reminds me of biofeedback.  Relaxing and staying that way while playing
B009MCRHH6|5|We've had World of Goo for the Wii for years. Just got a Kindle Fire and had to get the WoG app. My kids and I all love playing this game. The graphics are beautiful, the music is awesome, and the game is fun and challenging.
B001PO53IO|5|Beautiful animation!  And if you haven't seen the episode \\"Rookies\\", you need to check it out.  There are some great stories going on in this show.  It's not just for kids.
B001RTSPVY|5|It took my wife & I a number of years to become fans of Breaking  Bad. Once we ordered the 1st & 2nd seasons, we had to have the rest. Naturally watching on AMC now but I enjoyed better on the DVDs. No commercials and volume screaming when my wife scans through the commercials.

0316078913|5|For the Santaland Diaries, alone, you must buy Holidays on Ice! David Sedaris is a brilliant wit, and I'd have no problem comparing him to Mark Twain. How can I best describe the quality of this book? Well, I was sitting alone in a coffee shop, reading Holiday on Ice. I began to laugh so hard, it was at the point where strangers were staring at me, no doubt assuming I was drunk. The more I tried to stifle the laughter, the stranger the snorting noises were that I made. I was mortified, but could not stop reading! The only other thing I could compare this to is a book of essays by John Waters.<br /><br />Be warned: You may not want to read this in public!
B003UBTX6S|4|Get this one if you enjoyed the series before.  I am looking forward to finishing the whole series this one was one that was hard to put down.
B009HSVHV2|5|Was a bit surprised at how well Kiss sounded when I preveiwed the audio clips. As a former Kiss follwer from the begining, yes I was a teenager the first album came out. I quit following Kiss in the mid to late 80's. I just have gotten back into regaining intrest in them. I still prefer old Kiss, but I find this album to be a good mix of old and new. At least thats how I feel about it.

B000001ZS4|5|This album edges out its 1976 predecessor, Oxygene, with more memorable melodies and neater use of burbling, bleepy stereo effects. Jarre took full advantage of the lack of good electronic percussion in the mid-'70s, by building rhythms and soundscapes out of other synthetic sounds, molded into two seamless sides of an LP record. You've heard most of it before, even if you've never heard of Jarre. Best listened to in total darkness.
1439190275|1|After reading this book, I read T. Colin Campbell's one-star review of it, then Campbell's The China Study, then Caldwell Esselstyn's Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, then books by McDougall and Fuhrman.  I now suspect that the authors of this book, as well as Gary Taubes and other low carb fad diet gurus are just opportunists trying to cash in on the millions Robert Atkins made telling people what they wanted to hear.  Like those \\"debunkers\\" of global warming, they make seemingly credible points and cite seemingly credible studies, but when you read the responses of Campbell, Esselstyn, McDougall, Fuhrman and look at the big picture, it becomes impossible to believe in these low-carb, high fat diet myths any longer.      Try googling famous vegan athletes, then google famous low-carb or Atkins athletes.  Or just look how trim and healthy Campbell, Esselstyn and McDougall look in their old age and compare to pictures of Atkins before he died.  I've been on the whole-foods plant based diet for a month now, have lost ten pounds, and feel healthier than I have in a long time.  I know one can lose weight on the Atkins diet in the short run, but I don't think it can be sustained in good health for a lifetime.  If it could, there would be lots of famous Atkins/Low Carb athletes out there, no?
B005ZOBNOI|5|I thought this book was fantastic.  It had an amazing storyline that kept me interested all the way through. I didn't want the story to end
031606792X|4|Book four and the finale to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga is Breaking Dawn. We've learned a little bit about the Volturi, the leading Vampire coven, in each of the first three books. In Breaking Dawn, things finally come to a head with Jacob, Edward and Bella. Again, I might be a little vague to avoid giving too much away.<br /><br />As Bella and Edward take a new turn in their relationship, Jacob is left to his own self discovery until his heart is finally snatched away from him. As the three of them struggle to make the best out of the deranged circumstances they are put under, in the background the Volturi are planning a brutal take over. When your body and vengeance can live forever, a takeover can only mean one thing: death. Will Bella lose her true love? Her new family? What will Jacob risk to do what he feels is right?<br /><br />Breaking Dawn answers all of the questions that the tortured readers, waiting for the next book, asked about. Because of that, the book can at times seem rushed and out of sync with the rest of the series. I'm going to again give my personal opinion and say that I don't feel that the book was rushed at all. I think that in order to wrap up a fantastic saga, Meyer had to fit a lot of information in an infinitesimally small space between two covers. The way that she handles this in the book is absolutely fabulous!<br /><br />Fair warning - this book is different (but not out of sync) from the rest of the saga. I would have to say that Breaking Dawn pushes the Young Adult boundaries just a smidge.
B00FATEJYE|5|I think this is a great game but is very violent and intense for young children in your room
B00L47E6IA|5|This is an awesome finalé to a wonderful life career for this artist.

B005ZOBNOI|5|I honestly don't know how to review this in a way that would do the book justice.  This story was beautiful, touching, and yes, sad.  There was still a lot of beauty even in the sadness.  Not to sound corny, but it really was one of those books that touches your heart and soul.  Hazel was awesome, but it was Augustus who truly stole my heart.  I was completely surprised at how much I laughed and smiled while reading this.  Even though tears were shed and my heart hurt, I am so glad I read this.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B004DLPXAO|2|Takes longer to boot up.<br />Does nothing for the reading experience.<br />Leave well enough alone.<br />Why fix something that isn't broke?
068816689X|5|Though I consumed this book in a matter of hours, I found it so emotionally affecting that I had to stop and take a deep breath now and then, walk around the block, before I could continue reading. All the more  compelling for its simple, honest style, this is a tale of extraordinary  courage and perseverance on the part of Edith Hahn Beer. Would that more of  her Austrian and German neighbors (of the &quot;Aryan&quot; stripe)  had  had a greater share of the integrity displayed by this woman.  Her  life  irreparably fractured by events that remain utterly vivid and disturbing  50-some years after the fact, she somehow manages an astonishing degree of  objectivity in her assessment of the evil forces arrayed against her and  every other European Jew in those very dark decades.  Definitely not a  story for the fainthearted, this disturbing book and others like it need to  be read and reread  precisely to help prevent their repetition in the  future.
B00O2COBCU|5|great movie.  I will watch it few more times--love sci-fi with giant robots and giant alien creatures.
B001QTXM5Y|4|Watchmen (Zack Snyder, 2009)<br /><br />Dear Zack,<br /><br />May I still call you Zack, even after all those nasty things I said in my review of 300? I hope so, because I'm going to start out my review of Watchmen by taking them all back. I really don't hope you get eaten by wild dingoes in the middle of the night, and I have no intentions of making you into a delectable stew. Okay, 300 was still a monstrous desecration of its source material, but Watchmen is, for most of its length, as slavishly faithful as 300 was a departure. For a movie that's been in on-and-off development for almost twenty years, that was necessary, and adding in those shots that were made to look as much like the panels they were drawn from as possible was a wonderful touch. But more on this later.<br /><br />For those of you who have been in a cave for twenty years, Watchmen takes place in an alternate-universe 1985 in which superheroes exist. Well, one superhero exists, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). The rest of the Watchmen are just regular guys who dress up and fight crime with good old-fashioned brawn and technology. At least, that is, until the Keene Act, passed a few years previous, which outlawed masked vigilantes. Dr. Manhattan was appropriated by the government, of course, for as a military asset, he's incomparable--a nuclear scientist who, through a nasty accident, has become something much more than human. With him went Silk Spectre, now known as plain ol' Sally Jupiter (27 Dresses' Malin Akerman), Doc's girlfriend. The Comedian (The Accidental Husband's Jeffrey Dean Morgan) went into retirement, as did Nite Owl (Hard Candy's Patrick Wilson), who spends his weekends drinking beers with the original Nite Owl, Hollis Mason (Stephen McHattie, recently of Pontypool), the only former masked crusader to have gone public with his identity save Adrian Veidt (Brideshead Revisited's Matthew Goode), now a captain of industry). There was one other member of the Watchmen, Rorshach (Shutter Island's Jackie Earle Hailey). Rorschach ignored the ban, and still wanders at night in his mask and gloves, fighting street crime and doing voice-overs. (Rorschach is an obvious nod to Travis Bickle, but without the cab.) Now that all the players are set up, the movie opens with someone breaking into the Comedian's apartment and killing him, and Rorschach's appearance on the scene soon after. Combined with a few other events and portents, Rorschach comes to the conclusion that someone is stalking former masked vigilantes. His former colleagues initially dismiss the idea, but a few of them come around, Meanwhile, all is not well on the home front with Laurie and Dr. Manhattan; Doc's working with Veidt on an energy source that will revolutionize life as we know it (and neutralize the Soviet threat in the process), and Laurie's feeling lonely. Meanwhile, Manhattan (whose voice bears a startling resemblance to Hal's from 2001) has the charge leveled at him that his very presence may be giving those around him cancer, leading to him rethinking his remaining on Earth. It's all part of something bigger, of course, but in order to get to the bottom of it, the former friends will have to reforge old bonds, and sever even older ones, in their respective quests for truth.<br /><br />Simply put, Watchmen is one of the most dazzling visual spectacles I've ever seen, and it is so perfectly paced that it is also the fastest three hours I've ever spent watching a movie. (This is the directors' cut, natch.) I wasn't sure how much I expected from this cast, but that may have more to do with the fact that like most Watchmen fans I've been casting and recasting this thing in my head for decades. All of them do an outstanding job. Snyder's direction is the best I've seen from him, and as I said, for the most part, the adaptation is slavishly faithful to the original comic. (The bits from Hollis Mason's book are absent, as is Takes from the Black Freighter; both appeared on DVD as this hittheaters in animated form.) Of course, the big change, which involves the climax, has been the source of controversy since about ten seconds after the movie was released in theaters. Put me down with those who felt it intelligent, well-thought-out, and, if not better than the comic book's climax, as good. Simply put, I expected Watchmen to be watchable but throwaway; what I actually got surpassed my expectations in every possible way. One of the best movies I've seen in 2009. **** ½course, the big change, which involves the climax, has been the source of controversy since about ten seconds after the movie was released in theaters.

B00G2KV92U|1|Very disappointed.  Waited 11-years for that??  3-songs a barely worth listening too.  I love Boston and have seen them many times in concert, but this album is not a Boston album at all.
B000002G30|5|What more can be said about Monster Magnet? That they are one of the last orginal rock bands in existance? That their sound is a culmination of everything from punk to heavy metal? That Dave Wyndorf is a genius? All have been said before. The proof? This album: Dopes to Infinity. <br />from the very beginning Dopes to Infinity is something special. The title track is not only heavy, blusy, and smashed, it is almost anthem like to the point where the word &quot;beautiful&quot; is not over doing it. The blistering assault of Negasonic Teenage Warhead is a quintacential hook of the album. With an infinitly hummable tune and a chorus you'll find yourself singing aloud to yourself. Look to Your Orb for the Waring is is perhaps the albums best song musically with it's obvious nods to not only Sabbath and Deep Purple, but also to Pink Floyd and even Nirvana. I Control I fly is one of the heavyest tracks to ever come out of the band, burning with energy and Daves ego in full swing. Dead Christmas is the albums wild card. All it needs is Jim Morrison instead of Dave to make it a Doors song! The album as a whole is a phenomina not seen in ages. Like AC/DC's Back in Black, Magnet will more than likely never be able to top this release. Certainly almost nobody else can. My advice: By this album, you will not regret it.

Great game length, with a unique twisted story line, and beautiful graphics! I played this on my kindle fire and didn't encounter any glitches or problems. Keep up the great work G5, just wish your prices were a little lower.
1892005034|1|The book was required reading for a class I am taking. Ouch--practically unreadable, and even less useful. I have studied communication for more than a decade. Nothing here makes sense to me--suspend judgement, how do humans do that? It's instinctual for humans to draw ethical lines in the sand, and according to this author, we shouldn't. I kept reading in hopes I'd discover something new or practical to use with my clients. I never did.
B00ECU2RGY|3|Okay enough but not great.  Tom Cruise sure likes being the good guy.  Could have been better, but looks like he's the boss.

B001BZE82E|3|I received this watch floating loosely packed in a padded envelope with the watch case cleanly broken into 4+ pieces.  The watch appeared undamaged so I had it sized and am wearing it.  Seems to be loosing 2-3 minutes a day so will try to replace the battery (though I bought it new, or so it was stated).  Hope to see it correct itself once the battery is replaced.  Was a bit surprised at the condition it was received in as there are so many reviews on Amazon critical of bubble envelope packaging and breakage of watch boxes.  Seems someone would reconsider shipping strategies on Swatch watches due to the potential damage to the watch?

0316010669|1|It really does dawn on you somewhere in the middle of the book that Gladwell's intelligence is somehow borrowed, his examples redundant...He IS pushing his brand, his intellectuality, never quite making a solid point. The book is full of \\"deep\\" hmmm moments that never really amount to anything substantial. I'm glad I had the library copy (it would be a sorry waste of money). <br /> <br />The moment I read about the involuntary subconscious association with the DOMINANT race, I knew Gladwell can't be taken seriously.

B000001E8P|5|I admit it; there was a period of time in my life when I was a big fan of Britpop, but even though my taste in music has moved on, this is one of the few albums of that genre that I can still listen to today without cringeing.  &quot;Different Class&quot; was released about fifteen years into &quot;Pulp&quot;'s existence, and it is unlike any album they had released before or have released since. I don't know what spirits were conjured up in the studio to create such a great album as &quot;Different Class&quot;, but unfortunately,&quot;Pulp&quot; out did themselves. It's fair to say that this album is a masterpiece, and everything else &quot;Pulp&quot; has done does not measure up to it.  With that said, &quot;Different Class&quot; is probably one of my all time favorite albums in any genre.
0316216453|4|I bought the DVDs as well - as I watched it some 30 years ago it is still reverberates in my mind - very good as you read - the scenes come back - I love to read it again and again - good book to preserve.

B00425S1H8|5|I had been using a similar device to interface between a laptop running Windows XP and a Yaesu FT-950 transceiver for Ham Radio Deluxe.  When I upgraded the laptop to one running Windows 8 the interface no longer worked.  After trying several setup configurations in Ham Radio Deluxe I determined the interface was the problem.  When I installed the Prolific PL2303H everything started working as before the laptop upgrade.  I have not experienced any problems interfacing to the FT-950.  The interface just works, no messing around required!

B0013FBS20|2|Apparently high-dollar special effects and a heretofore unknown superhuman quality given to the infected humans is supposed to be enough to make a blockbuster.  I like Will Smith in almost anything, and while I applaud loudly the special effects, the story is lost most of the time, convoluted and disjointed all the time, and only slightly related to the original.  The modified story eliminates nearly every small ray of hope, substituting seemingly unending darkness and obscuring some of the best subtexts of the original.  Don't waste your time and money on this version; get \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston instead.

0470450266|5|This is so far the best ZBrush book, and possibly the best 3D character modeling book period. Spencer has done all the work for the reader, it couldn't be any simpler. It's easy to read and straight to the point. Spencer goes into great detail about the tools and digital sculpting. In all the years I've bought stuff online I don't think I have ever written a review, this time I had to. This book is on my desk at all times, for technical reference and artistic inspiration. If you are looking for a great cg sculpting/modeling book then right now this is the only choice. Aside from taking an actual ZBrush character sculpting class in person, I see nothing that comes even close to this book. Spencer even covers human anatomy in detail just as any artist should know and explains in detail what tool would be best for which part of the sculpting process and how to use it. During my time in college I've meet life drawing instructors that covered anatomy less than this guy.

B004SJ3BCI|5|Got started playing this when I was spending a month with family on the east coast. Boy did I ever get hooked!!! Have been playing this ever since whenever I have a little free time to spare.<br />So much fun to play with very little thinking/strategy involved. Just a nice quite time to spend relaxing with some very angry birds. Would recommend to everybody - my young grandkids are even playing it.

B000LC55F2|5|I know there have been some bad reviews about this movie already, but I just want to say that they are wrong!! The cast in this movie is amazing! Any movie with two powerful actors like Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is always amazing! This movie keeps your head turning at every minute and is definitely worth watching. I enjoyed the suspense and the suprising twists in the movie.

B008AK8FHM|5|“Proof of Heaven” is an amazing story of a man who went to heaven while in a deep coma, long enough to have caused major brain damage, and returned to earth to live a normal life once completing rehab.<br /><br />The author, Dr. Eben Alexander III, M.D., is a neurosurgeon who before his near death experience (NDE) had a scientist’s mind that did not leave much room for spiritual faith. He especially did not believe in NDEs until he experienced his own. I first heard of the book when Eben Alexander was interviewed by Katy Couric on her afternoon show.<br /><br />The book provides the scientific explanations for NDEs that Alexander relied upon before experiencing his own. He describes his time in heaven in complete detail, including the evidence which later provided absolute proof to him that he had experienced a near death experience. This is a very moving book that will be hard to put down once you are about a third of the way into the account. This is a book you will definitely want to read.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This book is not perfect, but it is beautifully written overall and an immersive experience. When I finished the last page, I smiled, looked out the window and took a moment to enjoy a beautiful morning because this book put me in such a good, appreciative mood. Although the book is long and the chronology is all jumbled up, you soon get used to it and take your time savoring the well drawn characters and the details of their lives. I am an impatient reader and usually move on if I am not intrigued by page 50. I also get tired of overly descriptive prose and writers who take too many trips to the thesaurus to insert uncommon words to make them seem literate. Here, a few passages were overly ornate, but overall the detail and carefully crafted pages were a rare confection for appreciative readers. Well done.
0375707972|4|This was the most unusual book.  Such a different viewpoint for the era in time. It was disturbing but also riveting.  It gave great insight into how the main character felt about her secret.  A fast read also.  It moved and  didn't drag on with needless descriptive passages.
0887081770|5|This book had an added surprise with the pop-ups!!! Granddaughter was a very happy girl!! Thanks
B00F7YHDWC|3|A very odd game, but entertaining.

0374105235|5|i dont normally read a lot ,but i picked up this book and ended up reading it in one day.it amazes me that in todays world that children have to go though such ordeals.
B0026IPAFO|5|Favorite movie 💚💜💙
B003XF1XOQ|4|I did get a little frustrated with the love story component of the book after a while  but, it was worth reading. I gotta admit, I'm looking forward to the movie as well.
B00IOVH8AW|5|Such a great song. It really gets you up and moving!! No matter how bad my day is going this song turns it around.
B000002UAR|1|I have always considered this a great album, mainly because everyone tells you it is and I believed the hype.<br />Finally last week I sat down and listened to it seriously for the first time. I was amazed at how poor it really was. The &quot;groundbreaking&quot; songs are nothing of the sort, certainly Hendrix was light years ahead. As for the standard songs, they represent the worst tin pan alley fluff imaginable.<br />I won't even mention taxman, as an earlier reviewer put it, hearing multi-millionaires complaining about their tax bills is appalling.<br />Thankfully I am no longer blind and can see this album for what it really is, regardless of how many critics tell you it is great, use your own ears and determine the truth.<br />One star.
B00CKOYVG8|3|lots of fun and challages
B0057A6GA6|5|Amazing amount of content for a mobile game. Well worth the price. Great to play while you are waiting on someone or need a muse.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I cant stop reading it! Cant stop dreaming about it either. Will be sad when I finish the last page
B004LWZW24|5|I liked this movie a lot. When I sent it to my son so he could evaluate it for his college film course he was delighted to get a lot of info from it.
B000ZLFALS|5|Love this movie!
B000AP04NI|5|Still fabulous after all of these years. If you love a good musical, look no further!

B00M25EALG|5|Great dvd at great price. Saved $3 over Wal-Mart price and got it at home.
B004DLPXAO|5|You can use this on an android and don't have to own a kindle reader. I would recommend this to anybody.
B0089EHWQE|5|This is definitely a must read.  Read it with my book club which resulted in some great dialogue.  Moyes does a really great job tackling a tough subject.  Thought the book was very well written and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish.
B00E8KLWB4|5|just hard enough to make you think. It's a stress buster and what better way to pass the time than searching for items.
B00EMXBDMA|5|In addition to writing a very exciting novel, the one will keep you guessing and \\"flat-out\\" surprise you at various points. Can't wait to see what he writes next.
B00G2GMRCU|3|it was ok, but not as good as his full length books, disappointing ending
B000089RVX|5|I have read some nasty reviews about this album 'Fallen', and I am here to say that this is a fresh album from a rock group. Now when a friend told me to get the album, I listen to a couple of songs, and I was hooked. What made this CD good is Amy Lee's vocals, they are fresh from the pop world, and Evanescence brings a dark and haunting album to the music industry. <BR> Now two of the songs are slow and they show Amy Lee's talent as a singer with 'My immortal' and 'hello' with the piano instead of hard rock rifts. <BR> Now this album is not for everyone because people have different taste in music, but give it a chance, and you might like it, if you dont, then that is ok too. But dont let this CD pass you by, this is so much better than any other pop albums out there that depict sex or drugs, it just brings real human emotion and how someone can relate to it (like myself). There were times where I do cry on the album, with 'My immortal' and 'hello' because these songs were heart touching to me, and I am glad that this band made a album like this.
B00BHHIWQO|5|Addictive!!! You need good eye hand coordination. Also great dexterity if using an iPhone. Can you say finger cramping?<br />Awesome!!!
B000FVBLEI|5|All That Remains is really surprising me the more I listen to them. Not only is the technical skill mad, but the melodies, hooks and brutal breakdowns are just flat amazing. Another thing that really surprises me is the lyrics, which are poignant and beautiful... Not like most metal out there. This is my second purchase from the band (\\"Overcome\\" was the first) and I definitely see myself filling in the rest of the collection.     Highly recommended for fans of:  The Devil Wears Prada  Becoming the Archetype  Underoath
B00000IQMT|1|Jeeze this is suck a stupid soundtrack. The movie is even worse! Whats so good about star wars? It's just some stupid people flying in ships. The music is for losers and it's just plain DUMB!

B00AECDDYY|4|Fun game but kind of got old quickly.  It is hard to see what is going on due to your ships going off the screen.  You have no idea what battle they are in and if they won or lost.
B00F91H666|2|I didn't like this movie!<br />It really sucks!<br /><br />I cannot believe how bad this Brad Pit mobie was!<br />It was a waste of my time!<br /><br />Sorry Brad Pit, you are extremely OVER RATED!
B000002BPS|5|This is the Best Punk-Rock album I have ever listened to, may be even THE best album ever. I recommend it to anyone who likes The Offspring's music, this has to be the best one of the lot so far. Nothing more to say about  it, it rules.
B000066I6N|5|Plant's renditions of these truely awesome classics, are given new life. I've always been a fan of his unique voice and his band is really solid. My personal favs on this album would include:<BR>Darkness Darkness (this is the highlight and definitely the best song on here, though they're all great), Morning Dew (the only version I had heard beforehand was the Jeff Beck Group - which was a bit more funkier, this is the version i like the best tho), Hey Joe (who hasn't heard the original Hendrix version? this takes the material a little more seriously and makes parts a bit more intense - with a few token Hendrix riffs), and One More Cup of Coffee (which has a very latin feel to it that's apparent from the beginning and of course the songwriting skills of Dylan!). <BR>Through the years I've been an average fan of Plant's solo work (tho one of my favorite bands of all time is Led Zeppelin). I haven't heard all of his albums, but from the ones I have heard this would probably be the best (except for maybe Fate of Nations). This album has alot of variation, I was definitely surprised.
B00DJFIMW6|5|It's so fun and it keeps me laughing with all the minions
B0094BB4TW|5|I love it because I can always find what I want.<br />It is fast and easy and leaves me time for other things.
B00003CWN3|4|I don't really know how \\"accurate\\" the film is in portraying the main character. Apparently there was some sort of controversy over this. I think it doesn't matter that much: it's a feature film, not a biography. Of course it stylizes its characters. Complaining about this just distracts from the substance of the film.    So, I don't know what Teena Brandon was really like. But, in the director's interpretation, she is a deeply confused and helpless person, the scatterbrained type who doesn't quite understand the world around her. She doesn't really know what to do with her life, she has no plan and nothing to look forward to. However, she is very imaginative, and invents a detailed biography for herself. She also calls herself Brandon Teena and attempts to pass herself off as a man, but she also fabricates other parts of her life that don't deal with her gender. For instance, she tells the other characters that she has a child, with no prompting on their part. She doesn't tell lies \\"on purpose,\\" it's more like she needs to believe them herself. Her \\"sexual identity crisis\\" (her words, and she says them like she doesn't quite know what they mean) is part of a much larger, more general \\"identity crisis.\\"    She commits theft, but she is essentially harmless to society. If she could find some kind of direction in life, she might find it easy to live normally, unlike the characters John and Tom, who really are genuine criminals, incapable of living any other way and unwilling to try. But more than anything, Brandon wants to be loved and accepted, instinctively. It doesn't really matter by whom. Consequently, she enters dangerous territory without understanding the risk to herself.    Long after the audience has realized that Brandon should leave town as soon as possible, she stays. Even after the first assault, it still seems like she doesn't understand her situation. Some critics complained about this aspect of Brandon's character, but I think it gives an air of genuine tragedy to the film. It's almost as if her fate is forcing her to stay.    The film reminded me a lot of Gus Van Sant's \\"My Own Private Idaho,\\" which is also about a lonely drifter who is stuck in a desolate region and craves love more than anything else. \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is much better, because it lacks Van Sant's Shakespearean pretensions. But like Van Sant's film, \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is best at appearances. The script is barely there. Half the film just wanders through dingy trailers, houses, bars and convenience stores, with convincingly forgettable dialogue. Most scenes are shot at night, usually indoors, so nature is totally absent. There's very little exposition. We don't really learn anything about the characters, but this is perfectly accurate. There is nothing to learn about them, and there's really nothing interesting that they could talk about.     But we can look at their faces, which are all chosen very well for the roles. Chloe Sevigny, as Lana, is immediately recognizable. Every suburb or small town has a girl like this, with a sullen face and a deliberately abrasive attitude intended to conceal her naivete. Every other face in the film is just as archetypical.    There is a moment of foreshadowing early in the film when John first encourages Brandon to drive over the speed limit, and then threatens her after they get pulled over by police. The impulsive, unreasoning way he goes from friendly to hostile is all the more frightening because it's so unexpected. When he finds out about Brandon's gender, he screams his disgust, but his anger is motivated more by \\"traditional\\" sexual jealousy. He would have assaulted a male rival also. But another man, especially one similar to John, might have been able to defend himself, whereas Brandon's gender and personality combine to make her uniquely vulnerable and defenseless, and this is the saddest thing about the story.    I do have a few problems with the film. It's very noticeable that all of the men in the film are vile and callous, not just John and Tom, but also the cops and the guys in the bar. At the same time, all of the women are basically sympathetic, not just Lana, but also her friend and even Lana's mother. Even if the women feel disgusted at Brandon's cross-dressing at first, they quickly come to support her. But the men never feel any remorse or sympathy, just rage and fear, and they blindly victimize everyone. I guess I can accept this in these particular characters, but still, I wonder about the director's intent.    The inevitable, brutal ending drags on for about half an hour, long after the conclusion becomes obvious. And the very last scene has a screaming toddler for maximum gut-wrenching effect. These lurid scenes may be manipulative (a similar scene in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is effective but occurs much more quickly), but there is also something believable in them. These men don't know anything that might inspire them to listen to reason or to feel compassion. It is hopeless to beg them for mercy.    I also don't quite believe the tender love scene between Lana and Brandon right after the first assault. The director includes it for pathos, to make the audience hope for their salvation, and to underscore how happy they might have been. But I'd suppose that right after such a terrifying experience, one would be too severely traumatized to express one's passion.    But, for most of its duration, the film is perceptive and believable, with a sympathetic and tragic heroine undone by circumstances that are too much for her to handle. The film is well in keeping with the tradition of American stories about marginal youth. If you like that subject, or if you are willing to consider watching a film about it, \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is a good choice.
B007J4T2G8|3|As this book has been so highly publicized, I finally decided to read it. Unfortunately, I found that it did not quite live up to the hype.  Although the characters were well defined, they are typical male and female characters that we have seen in many stories.  Christian is the enormously wealthy, godlike attractive male and Ana is an innocent but feisty virgin who totally captures his heart.  The sex scenes although very well done and erotic become a little too much around the middle of the book.  Oh, if only sex was this earth shattering In real life. Without the sex scenes, there is very little story to this book. It is just too predictable.  I found it really disappointing and lacking.
B00884GR0W|5|this game is awsome all it needs is better movement. like a 4 arrow control. other wise this game is awesome!!
0930289234|5|I've been told about Watchmen for years by various comic book fans in my life and I finally decided to take the plunge before the movie came out and ruined any chance I had of approaching this story fresh in its original form.<br />I'm glad I did but I really didn't need to be worried.  There is simply no way the movie is going to be able to capture all the nuance of this work.<br />Far more than just a comic book, this story incorporates fictional texts from inside the story's universe that draw you into its world in a way that I'm not sure any other medium could.  The story itself unfolds beautifully panel by panel as the notion of the superhero becomes twisted about and we follow along in the investigation of the murder of a masked crime-fighter named The Comedian (one of the few superheroes left still allowed to operate by the government).  As things progress and unravel we begin to sink into the lives of various superheroes with all their tics and problems and phobias and disorders slowly coming out into the open, learning along the way that they're not always super and they're not always heroes.<br />And then the medium itself begins to twist and take on other forms.  You'll read about a psyche evaluation that one of the heroes undergoes before finding an excerpt from that psyche evaluation \\"taped\\" to the end of one of the chapters.  Or you'll come across sections of an expose tell-all book that one of the heroes wrote neatly slipped in between the panels of the comic book form.  Police reports and transcripts and bits and pieces of this universe get piled onto the artwork and panels until it feels like you're lingering over a scrapbook from a real world instead of watching a fictional adventure unfold.<br />As a fan of bent heroes and dark drama I was very taken with this work and while the ending felt like it slipped out of my grasp a bit I still think this is one of the most original works of art I have ever encountered.

B009VSW15Y|2|I'm not at all tech savvy so I loved how easy this was to install and use.  However, the pictures are terrible--grainy, bad lighting, etc. and of course it is backwards.  So basically, all you can do is take unflattering pictures of yourself.  No thanks!
B000KQGX1Y|5|This was a gift for my Mom.  She loved the music, but especially the songs.  The voices of the girls are pure and clear - none better.
6304539282|5|You'll hear almost everyday how great and amazing and spectacular Star Wars is, and it's true. It's unavoidable; this is the best movie series ever made, at least to me. Return of the Jedi is my favorite, but I really  liked the other two; there are no boring or stupid parts of the Trilogy.  Even though it isn't included in this pack, I LOVED The Phantom Menace.  Don't listen to the &quot;so-so&quot; reviews that the critics gave it,  what do they know. Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Jake Lloyd are the best,  not to say I didn't like the other people. THIS TRILOGY ROCKS! BUY IT NOW!
B00E00P5JC|5|My grandson loves it. It is now his favorite dvd to watch it also is good grandparent  time for us.
B003O86FMW|4|Enjoyed the second book of the Games. Very action packed.<br />  Only thing is that some is to fast paced and skips a little.<br />  Ending is good but leads a bit of a cut off towards next book.
B00OALA8YS|5|I was absorbed by this version. I think is one of the most pertinent versions where non-fictional history is presented and blended with legend and myths. You can find out (finally) some actual facts about the Romanian history (son and father) + the role of Turks in those times. Although the turk characters were not well selected (they don't look like Turks) the illustration of their power and methods is pretty accurate.<br /><br />The storyline is clever, detail oriented, selling you the whole story in a very credible way.<br /><br />From second one until the end, the movie kept my attention and implication. A popular story with a serious delivery. A well earned 5 stars, in my opinion.

B00007AJF9|2|A previous reviewer referred to this film as 'not quite historically accurate' which is putting it very midly indeed.  There is hardly anything in this very odd film that is historically accurate.  I don't wish to be ageist, but Richard Attenborough is about 40 years too old for the part of Lord Burghley, he was only about 35 when Elizabeth became Queen, and what's all this rot about her dismissing him from her service/  She never did, eh stayed with her until he died.  Equally absurd is the notion that she didn't know Leicester was married, of course she did, his marriage wasn't secret.  And they keep on having sex all over the place, as if there weren't spies everywhere at court watching like hawks for any signs of immorality (the Spanish Ambassador bribed her laundresses to report on the state of her sheets).  The Duke of Anjou is shown visiting her as an adult suitor (he was bout 7 at the time).  And as for the Duke of Norfolk, he looks like something out of Lord of the Rings, a friend of mine remarked that she kept expecting to see a lot of dwarfs dancing round him saying \\"shall we kill him now master\\" or something.  Everybody acts very well, but it's all such rubbish.  Why wasn't the real story of Elizabeth considered interesting enough to make a good film?  She didn't exdactly have a dull life, after all.

B0012QE4Q2|2|For those who give high ratings to 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can only suggest that you either rent or buy the superb 1969 film, 'Anne of the Thousand Days'. Both films basically deal with the same subject but there's really no comparison. Where 'Anne' is a complex historical recreation and magisterial drama, 'The Other Boleyn...' is a ponderous soap opera, where numerous film-goers today have been taken in by the film's lavish production values (shot in High Definition), along with the three big name Hollywood stars who can't hold a candle to predecessors such as Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold who really make you feel like you're watching flesh and blood human beings who lived in the 16th century.<br /><br />I haven't read the book which the movie was based on but I question why it was necessary to tell Anne Boleyn's story through the eyes of her older sister Mary (inaccurately depicted as the younger sister here in this film). Mary's part in 'Anne of the Thousand Days' is wisely depicted as brief and her bitterness toward her father for 'pimping her out' to King Henry VIII is much more believable than Scarlett Johansson's Mary who continues to hold a soft spot for the King despite being unceremoniously dumped by him and bearing a child who was dubbed a bastard. Mary is basically depicted as a saint who we're supposed to identify with because she has a 'good heart'. Unfortunately, most saints make for boring drama and Johansson's Mary is no exception. Johansson did well in Woody Allen's well-scripted 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' but she is completely out of her element in the 16th century. Instead of a world weary traveler in the Tudor court, Johansson's Mary is more like an Amish-like simpleton whose grim and ponderous expressions suggest that she is an actor of extremely limited range. Mary has little to do in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. Her two big scenes (the love scene with King Henry and the birth of her son) are devoid of substantial dramatic conflict.<br /><br />What's worse is the suggestion that Anne and Mary were competitors for Henry's approval. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there was no competition between the two sisters. Mary's story was over when Anne comes on the scene. Genevieve Bujold defiantly states that she will never let the King do what he did to her sister and it takes a very long time in that film before Anne changes her mind. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Natalie Portman's Anne is a cold and calculating schemer from the beginning, inexplicably accusing her sister from taking the King from her. Later, she blames Mary for being responsible for the breakup of her secret union with Henry Percy. Ann's Uncle, the Duke of Northrop, orders that the two lovers separate. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', the breakup is a matter of state policy. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wolsey, threatens Ann's lover and they're forced to part due to the King's designs on Anne. In 'The Other Boleyn Girl', Anne's undoing is attributed to what appears to be something like a bi-polar episode. After Henry rejects her because she can't bear a male heir, she becomes unhinged and ends up slapping him. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Anne is both the victim of Henry's cruelty and her own ambition to see her daughter declared the first in succession to the English throne.<br /><br />Screenwriter Peter Morgan's view of Henry VIII is way off the mark. Thanks to Morgan's superficial portrait, Eric Bana, turns Henry into a GQ model rather than the petty but complex Henry of history. For those who are offended that I dare suggest that Bana isn't right for the part, I strongly urge you to watch Richard Burton in 'Anne of the Thousand Days'; afterward, come back and tell me with a straight face that you think Bana was right for this part. What's missing in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is how Henry relates to members of his Court. Who are his friends and confidants? And of course there's the whole political intrigue of the court whichis glossed over in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. The key players, Cardinal Wolsey and the King's adviser, the deadly Thomas Cromwell, are missing. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there are a myriad of characters interacting with the King and as a result of these interactions, a full portrait of Henry's personality comes through. Here, Bana's Henry is dull and witless. What's more, Morgan's view of Henry and Anne's relationship has no real grace or drama. The best Morgan can come up with is a crude rape scene which reduces Henry to a comic book villain.<br /><br />'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without a few good points. Ana Torrent is brilliant as Katherine of Aragon, depicting the quiet dignity of a woman terribly wronged. David Morrissey is credible as the steely social-climbing uncle who holds the strings in the family. Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyn mother acquits herself well but she's a bit too much of a feminist icon for 16 century England. Mark Rylance was much too ineffectual as Sir Thomas Boleyn but he looks very good as a 16th century nobleman.<br /><br />Production-wise, 'The Other Boleyn...' is filmed in sumptuous high definition and the scenes in the English countryside are a pleasure to watch. The camera work is for the most part pretty good with first-time director Justin Chardwick shooting scenes from a multiplicity of angles.<br /><br />In the end, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not the other Boleyn's Girl story. If you want the 'real McCoy', then you must see Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold together. They are master craftsmen and you will be truly moved by their performances. The remake connects the dots but can never hold a candle to the 1969 production. Sometimes it's best to leave things well enough alone!Other Boleyn Girl'.

0684833395|5|Catch-22 is a sometimes hilarious and sometimes sad book about the absurdity of war itself, and especially the running of a war machine. The protagonist suffers through one disaster after another barely keeping his life while those around him lose theirs. While it sounds like there is no room for laughter in this book what with the deaths of all his friends, the author just hints at the death scenes which are presented in full towards the end of the book. Thus the end of the book is more serious than the beginning. The description of life in war torn Italy is especially difficult to read because it is so evocative of the way life was during World War II. I highly recommend this book for both it's serious aspects and funny moments.
B007SYWFRM|4|I actually really enjoy this game. I have just a few problems with it. (1) No matter what I do, I can't seem to add friends, which makes completing a goal later in the game pretty impossible (or, at the very least, very difficult and slow going) . (2) When I was closing in on level 25, I took all my pieces and put them into my inventory to design my village better, this caused me to lose four of my more expensive families. (3) Why aren't we able to sell anything thing in this game?  If I could sell my excess decorations,  I'd be so much happier with this.<br /><br />Overall I like the game, despite the small annoyances here and there.  If I had paid for the game, I'd probably be disappointed, and maybe even angry with the minor glitches, but for a free game, I enjoy it. :)

This contributed significantly to the suspense of the story. It was an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable read.
B00DZP3KJ0|5|Scott Kelby's detailed and practical descriptions of the new Adobe LightRoom software have been invaluable to me as a first time user. I would buy it again but in paper as finding the section I want on my Kindle is difficult.
B009XIXVU6|5|Khaled Hosseini gets better with every book, if that is possible.  Masterful storytelling, gripping characters. Wonderful choice for all ages -- middle readers through adult.
B0027BOL4G|5|Stuff everyone should know
B00RXX81JY|4|Stephen King at his best. The use of previous characters and incidents was a clever way to make the reader feel more at home in the plot.  King always manages to surprise, even though the happy ending bit is predictable.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|I have been a fan of Jeffery Archer since I read Kane and Abel - this is the third book in a series - the reader should start with the first book - and travel through the years with this family. Archer is a great story teller.
B005LAIIMG|5|Arrived quickly and exactly as advertised with no issues.  Movie is fantastic too! Couldn't see the difference between the DVD and the Blu-ray.
B00KNWYDU8|5|I need help. I bought three packs and then it reloaded the game, which reset all the gems I got. If the owner of this game sees this message, I WANT MY 200 plus Gems. please. Other than that, it is AWESOME
B0000524E5|5|Very entertaining movie.  Music is so good I had to have the soundtrack (just the 1st one, not the &#34;more&#34;)
B00C8S9W0G|5|Excellent continuation of the story line with all the twists and turns one expects from Diana Gabaldon.  I recommend all her books.
B00ADQCBEY|5|Great show, free for Amazon Prime! Definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. Just make sure you have some free time cause you'll be hooked!
0789723107|5|Not much more to say.  Its a definitive introduction, that influenced my life immensely.  I have an M.A. in Multimedia (first graduating class in the world), have been in the web industry for 10 years, and manage a 20,000 page web site.
B00AEBB8YW|5|All actors as good as original.
B00KA87GCW|3|Super fun. Like it so far. Just started playing. Can't wait to see all the awesome things I can do in the game. My friends love it too.
B00R3DO58K|5|This is my fave Trilogy. I am a big Hobbit/Lord of the Rings fan.
B003JTHXOK|4|This book is much better than the movie!  I enjoyed the author's perspective as he described what the husband/policeman was going though in his mind as he justified his own actions.  It made for a more realistic and exciting (and creepy!) story.
B008FRFN7A|4|I'm doing good work so can keep up with it ,up is good stuff they help you anyway they can so enjoy everything ..
B00IG2DOKM|3|Played for a number of months on kindle when all of a sudden it stopped working. Application opens and then closes.
B003UBTX6S|3|Although, for me, it starts off slow, it gets better as it goes on.  By the end I was ready for the next book.  The characters are really being developed nicely, and this book answers questions I didn't even know I had.  Looki g forward to the next one.
B003ODIZL6|5|I choose this rating because it  deserves to be viewed that many times....<br />I do like this book because it shows my grammar when i put something in wrong....<br />I would recomend this book because it will get u ready for school and collage basically the rest of your career......
B00JP5ONY0|1|The photografy is good because Greenland is worderful in the summer. They also did a take from an airplane flying from up, very innovative. However the story is no sense at all.
B00AA0TJO8|5|Its pretty cool having to draw your own hero instead of something already made and you can even draw a cat to save your best a pizza this game gives you options on that and I find that amazing
B007T8BYWE|4|I like this game because often you dont know what the pic is going to be until after the puzzle is done.
0307949508|5|wonderful detailed oriented very put together, great author better than the first book, the girl with the dragon tatoo. thank you.
B005OK721G|5|I like the script and the film and I watch it over and over. The performance of Zoe Saldana is excellent, and I can't imagine anyone else in this role anymore. The script is close to the reality and it makes it more real. You miss too much if you haven't seen it yet.<br />It is must-see film.
B0094BB4TW|5|works
B008FVZHKO|5|Why did it take me so long to discover this band? This is how groups are supposed to jam. Outstanding-even an Alex Lifeson solo!
B000M3452Y|5|I enjoyed their 2005 release 'LCD Soundsystem' so I thought I would give them a listen for their second time around. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprized! They are making much more sense to me now and I appreciate their dance/pop routine much more. In other words, if you liked their previous effort this is much better! Buy it!
1591396190|4|\\"Blue Ocean\\" is a metaphor of uncontested market space that is reached by reconstructing market boundaries. The authors convincingly show how this impacts profit and growth, and why we should focus analysis on strategic moves as opposed to strategic companies.<br /><br />Central to the theory is the \\"strategy canvas\\", in which you rate a company on a set of industry factors. You than tweak these to find uncontested market space. This demands some creativity, but basically you decide for each factor whether it will be reduced, eliminated, created, or raised.<br /><br />There is a good set of convincing cases to support the point. By seeing how companies invented and exploited blue oceans you get an intuitive feel for  potential in a market.
068484267X|5|\\"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood\\".  This quote is from Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes.  The constant theme throughout the entire memoir is the suffering McCourt went though during his childhood. <BR> Frank McCourt was born in New York, and grew up in the slums of Limerick, Ireland.  As he takes you through the memories of his childhood, the suffering at times is hard to believe.  McCourt and his family lived with hardly any food or clothing, due to the pure laziness of McCourt's alcoholic father.  And when you believe that things can't get any worse for the family, they do.  Countless deaths, many illnesses, taunting school children, and small triumphs, all color the book and its many pages. <BR>McCourt uses descriptions that put vibrant images in your head of his keen memory of his childhood.  You can almost feel his hunger pains at times.  When the slightest happiness occurs, you are there to feel the joy.  Although the book is saddening, McCourt makes light of even the darkest of situations with his subtle humor.  <BR> His great ability to retain all of his life memories is truly remarkable; yet his childhood seems to the utmost extreme.  We formed a sense of compassion for his family's mishaps, but some scenes leave us disturbed.  With the repetitive deaths, illnesses, and poverty factors, we feel that tends to bore us.  Overall it is a descriptive and valid piece of history.  <BR> We find this memoir to be one of the best pieces of literature we have ever read.  Filled with emotion and with undying attentiveness, McCourt has caught our eye and has kept us there, by his side, throughout the book.  His story illustrates a piece of world history that we must not forget, and it leaves us more thankful for what we have.
B000YMHOUS|5|a simply lovely movie
B00G5G7K7O|5|My family loves this movie.  We saw it in the theater and new we had to own it.  We have watched it several times since receiving it and love quoting lines.  This Disney movie is truely one all ages can enjoy over and over as there are no really scarry characters in it like some other Disney movies.  Even our teans like it.  The soundtrack is execellent too.
B00DUGCLY4|4|It's a cool game
B000IZ8DZQ|4|One may wonder how a soft-spoken and seemingly quite ordinary Troy Kennedy-Martin (screenwriter) could concoct so elaborate and devious a plot as this. “Wow” serves the purpose of reacting to the intricacies of the dynamics of his scheme. And someone had gone as far as inventing a guide to the most original and bizarre alternate routes through and around the city of Turin. Michael Caine, as ever, carries off his facility to portray a lovable rogue; and who could not adore Benny Hill being Benny Hill?<br />Of course, Noel Coward adds a most British counterbalance to the visual, as well as that matchless English penchant for absurdity.<br />Perhaps the many elaborate heist stories, both earlier and later, may slightly dull the novelty of the general theme, and despite the discontinuities in the production, director Peter Collinson managed to get a great deal from his cast and to come out with what is arguably not a classic, but at least 99 minutes of G-rated fun.
B00B2V66VS|4|Game very interesting, it maintains a common  interest to continue to a higher goal. I'm trying to beat my 5 year old high score. She loves the game.
B00MNYTWMI|4|Love the game!!! Lots of fun
B002MQYOFW|5|I started this book unsure of what to expect.  But with each page, I became completely in love with the story.
B007GCY8FS|5|I love Lee Child's books, especially the Reacher books.  I liked this one too.  I don't know if it was because I was in the middle of moving, but this book read a bit slower than his others.  Still loved it though!  I would recommend this to my friends.
B00L23RZO8|3|It was ok.
B00008VGK0|3|think it's an ok track for madonna, but absolutely love the 'felix' remix and am disguisted bij missy's one. however every now and then i find myself humming and shake a litlle to missy's one; maybe it's grower,dunneu! peter's and paul's ones are great too, but love the one from peter lot's more!!! <BR>i believe this track is not representable for the rest of the album, and what's 'die' doning on it, can't believe it, it's somehow a little out of place. but the rest of the album is awesome!
B00028HBKM|5|The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better ,but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie, you might think it will be boring, so did I ,but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics, then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace, the Power, the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel.
0062409859|5|Both Ms. Lee's books are mirrors of the time they represent 1935 and 1955 and should be read with that in mind.  If Ms. Lee's editor, after reading her manuscript of Go Set A Watchman, her first novel, hadn't suggested Ms. Lee write a book about life from young Scout's viewpoint, we may have never experienced To Kill A Mockingbird.  The serendipity of the Watchman manuscript being found is a miracle. I loved Go Set A Watchman as I always wondered the rest of the story.  If you haven't read To Kill A  Mockingbird you need to read it first.  If you've read it but not recently you should re-read it before reading Go Set A Watchman.  I hadn't read it since the 60's and found I'd forgotten a lot of it and was happily reintroduced to all the characters. Both books are life in prose and I feel Go Set A Watchman will become as well loved as To Kill A Mockingbird.  I only wish Ms. Lee had written more books. For those who have mentioned Ms. Lee's writing is lot like Truman Capote's may not know they grew up together as sometime neighbors, possibly the Dill character, and she helped him do research for In Cold Blood.  They were friends and experienced the same time in the same South so it's understandable they would reflect the same insights.
B008469DGY|4|Fun Game for kids and adults. Have a blast challenging my kids and wife with this game! Probably not something you would play all the time but it's a good downtime filler.
B000J3OTSM|1|Very boring, very predictable, every cliche under the sun. The lame plot might have been bearable if there had been more dancing but there was hardly any. I hated the little brother and was very happy that he got plugged. What the heck was the big brother thinking, giving him money and telling him to take the bus? What an idiot! Everyone in this movie was an idiot.  Nora's Senior Showcase seemed to showcase everyone but her. And wasn't Tyler a senior too? I'm pretty sure you can't transfer into an art high school in the second half of your senior year -- you just don't have the background necessary to graduate. All the boys at that school were wimpy little things, weren't they? Could any of them hold up a partner in a pas de deux? Also, I couldn't tell how much time went by after Tyler quit and then asked to be taken back, but it had to be weeks. So Nora was willing to switch her Senior Showcase dance at the last minute back to one that hadn't been practiced for ages -- seems like quite a risk. Channing Tatum sure is nice to look at; that's about the only nice thing in this entire movie.
B005LAIGN2|1|The movie seems to consist of individual parts made by men in their spare time as they thought of scenes.  Then in the end the scenes were put together in the order they were completed and the whole thing was called a movie.  That is my opinion of the whole movie.  The actors were out of character and the whole thing just made very little sense to me.  I would not waste my time or money on this if I had know about the movie in advance.  That is my opinion.
B008ZOHCKE|3|I love to right story's, even when I was five, I wrote five story's a month! I don't like but it's ok, you know? I think teens might like it but me, no. I recommend it but dont, but good.
B00IJJUIMY|5|Kept you in suspense throughout. Not quite the outcome I had hoped for but all novels have an ending you might not see coming. Can't wait for the next book!
B00BD99JMW|4|I enjoyed this book. The ending was more realistic than I thought it we would be, but it was God. I definitely recommend it.
B005U9REU0|5|This movie is great!  I love the muppet like creatures, the singing, the storyline and everything else about it. Even though it is an older movie, the special effects are just amazing.
B003P2WO5E|5|Amazing! This novel is long, but well worth it. You take a journey of Kaladin as well as some of the royals. You follow them through many different trials. There's magic in this book...but it's more of a story with a little bit of magic instead of a super fantasy. There's some violence.
B005LAIGLO|5|I really like Mark Wahlberg in just about any movie. I find him very sexy and cool.Slightlly slow to start but it soon warmed up. Action ,thrills.,plot.This movie has it all.Well worth watching.
B009KWU6Q2|5|Classic!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1|Worst ever
B00AFEYUVG|5|Emma Watson comes of age in this and sheds off her &#34;Hermione&#34; image<br />and new comers Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller shine in this excellent new<br />film
0547884591|5|This book is one of the best. Tim Ferriss is an awesome author. Ive learned so much from this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to learn ANYTHING. 5stars+
B00FN2KR2G|5|I really enjoyed this book! It was one of those guilty pleasures books. I had to keep going back to it just to read another chapter.
0062059998|4|After the last book I was a little worried about this book. But I’m happy to report that I liked this book much better than the second book and I’m glad I stuck with reading it. No matter how much I disliked America in the second book.<br /><br />There is a lot happening in this book, with the selection, the rebels (north and south), families and friends, love and betrayal. This book also seems a lot darker in nature than the last two books, while we still get some humor; we also get a lot of heartbreak. And not just once, and it hits where it hurts the most. There is a lot of loss and we lose quite a few people but there is also some hope, hope of change.<br /><br />While this book has a happy ending, it takes a lot of grief to get us to there.<br /><br />America, was much better this book, now that she made up her mind she is sticking with it and fighting for what she wants. But it is not easy for her and a lot of things are against her. But she doesn’t give up. She still had her moments that nearly cost her everything and moments she was rather naïve and or careless, but for the most part she was okay and stood for what she believed in.<br /><br />Maxon, I was still one of my favorites and that didn’t change. I just adored him so much. Though he also had his moments but who doesn’t. But he always was honest and stood by his word.<br /><br />While I’m not a big fan of Aspen I didn’t dislike him that much this book. Though I thought he could have said certain things way earlier on the book or even the entire series.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and while it was sort of heartbreaking the end was also beautiful.<br /><br />There is a fourth book out but it seems more like a spin off. I will read it, I just don’t know when.<br /><br />Great book, great series even if I didn’t like the second one as much but the end was great with all it’s action and twist and turns.<br /><br />I rate it at 4 ★
B0000AFQS0|5|Who fans will not be disappointed in the great work done to convert this film to DVD.  This is rock as rock was meant to be. The extras on the second disk make it worth the cost of the total package, especially the Q&amp;A with Roger Daltrey.<br />For those who have teenage children who constantly listen to rap and other pretenders, sit them down with this movie and show them what rock really is all about.  Especially good after all these years is the closing &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; sequence, which gets my vote as Greatest Rock Song Ever Recorded. The band is ticked off, and playing as if they were ready to commit mayhem on a grand scale.  Outstanding film.
B00ARHAAZ6|5|Best book ever I recommend that you read it  because it is an amazing story almost a perfect book for everyone.
0316228583|1|.. I don't think it would have been published.  I think this author rode her name to a book people would not have purchased otherwise.  I have not read the Harry Potter series, so I had no bias even though I came to the novel with high hopes.  The title refers to a empty council seat after the holder's death, but I think Rowling is simply trying to show how vacant, or vacuous, people and humanity are generally.  Unfortunately, the 'vacancy' here can also refer to the book itself.
0060005696|2|Unfortunately, Barry Schwarz is a very smart man that isn't good with stating and backing up his ideas.  There is some interesting stuff in here but could be a lot more interesting if it was backed up with more studies and research and even surveys or things like that.  Most of the book is just the author talking about the subject and what he thinks about it and going on about it.  It makes for easy reading, but it lacks in depth.  The book could just as easily be 1/2 it's length and make itself just as useful but twice as efficient.  There are better choices out there (pardon the irony), though this book isn't a complete waste of time and as I said, at least it's easy to read.
B0094BB4TW|4|What's to like or not like about the app. It works and that's all that matters. Facebook is what it is.
045122499X|3|There are only two differences between \\"World Without End\\" and a Harlequin bodice ripper; excellent historical research, and length.  But Mr Follett has no idea how to handle the length part.  Michener keeps the reader's interest by skipping from generation to generation.  Serge & Anne Golon get bogged down in the minutiae of their characters lives.  Mr Follett, sadly falls into the same trap.  For a 1000 page novel to work, you have to give freeze-frame cameos.  You can't afford to expand endlessly on the minute by minute concerns of individuals.  That was the Golon's mistake.  By the time you get to about page three hundred, it all feels like yet another episode of \\"The Young and the Resless\\" or \\"All My Children\\", or some other endless soap opera where drama rules every scene, and political correctness oozes from every pore.   After that, you're just eager for it all to be over, the conflicts resolved, the bad guys getting their come-uppance and the good guys getting their rewards.  But that takes another 3 novels worth of reading!    Having had my rant, let me say what was good about the book.  Evidently, the portrayal of everyday life in the England of the Middle Ages was excellent.  The language was mature, the descriptive passages evocative.  The characters, at least at first, were well developed, three dimensional, and believable.  In particular, I must laud Mr Follett's careful avoidance (no doubt to his publisher's despair) of the prurient.  With so much debauchery, it must have been tempting to dwell upon details as a money spinner.  Thankfully this never happened.    If you are a thinking person, then I would say that probably this book is not for you.  Its grandiose tapestry is mainly pap for the day-time TV masses; an appeal to the lowest common denominator of historical fiction buffs.  Give it a miss unless you have a class assignment to research 14th century English life, and are too bored by the academic works on the subject.
B00000634J|5|John was on such a great path when he was killed so suddenly; his rehab/recovery, making up with Yoko, the birth of their son, and his last album, so heartfelt, so touching.  This CD encompasses a great selection of his solo music after the Fab Four, especially &#34;Woman&#34; and &#34;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night.&#34;
0061092037|4|Jeffrey Archer is a master of the short story with a twist.  This novel seems to be a number of short stories connected together in the guise of a full-length novel.  And thus it loses the elements that could have made it  a classic.  In addition, it seems that most people who have negative  comments on this book, are comparing it to &quot;Kane and Able.&quot;  I  confess to not having read that book (although I plan to soon) but have  read many other Archer stories/novels.  This entry is a good read but Mr.  Archer misses the mark when he fails to keep the reader rooting for the  main characters.  As the novel begins, we are introduced to the two main  characters and come to understand that they each have fatal flaws.  We know  from the beginning that they won't grow up to be likable characters and yet  we hope to understand their view points.  Instead I ended up hoping they  would both drop off the end of the earth.  I would refer uninitiated  readers to Archer's, &quot;As the Crow Flies,&quot; for the ultimate  &quot;good read.&quot;
B00001QGPS|5|Has there ever been a better combo?  This album is definitely worth the money.  You all know how good it is, so I dont need to go on.  Just go grab it before your boy does.  I could've lived without some of the wack Eric  Sermon beats on here.  Next time they should only have a few guest  producers, like Rockwilder and RZA.  And what is LL Cool J doing on here?   Go do another shark movie.  He brought that song down a notch.  I still  give this cd 5 stars.  None of that stuff can put a blemish on this Red and  Meth collabo. Best album I've heard in a while. The bonus tracks are an  extra gift.. the duo didnt need to give you that much. now go buy it  already.
B005EJNAK4|4|In a futuristic society a brilliant differently abled scientist creates a way for people with no or limited mobility to be able to do anything their hearts desire... from a dentist chair in their own homes through use of a synaptic uplink to a Surrogate, a Cyborg built to their specifications and based on their ability to pay for baseline models that only see, move, and talk to top of the line models able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Naturally there is a group of humans who refuse to embrace this new way of life and this is the driving force of the movie... which group is right? Unfortunately, someone has developed a weapon that shuts down the Surrogate and scrambles the brain of their owner. Who is behind it? Can Bruce Willis find out in time? I personally give the movie 4 stars because I liked it, but found the premise creepy on several different levels. My biggest problem with it was: Why pay all that money for some Cyborg if you are strapped to a chair the entire time they are at work doing your job for you running them so they can do your job? Otherwise, it is a great premise and does deliver a lot of twists and turns that make it worth the rental. I avoided going to see this at theaters because of all the bad press and reviews it got so please let me assure you that YES, I would have felt I had gotten my money's worth if I had seen it in a theater so do not let bad reviews and negative hype keep you from an enjoyable experience.

B004D7GU3C|5|is the only word I could come up with if I am asked to describe M+A+S using one word. Vuelve was a great album, but I can't say that ALL the selections were amazing. M+A+S--all selections are amazing. This CD has everything to make you dance, sing, cheer, and cry. I am sure that this has to do with the difference 6 years makes in the technology of recording, but the sound is and production is a cut above any music out there.<br /><br />Or perhaps it's the fact that I have waited so long for Ricky to put out some new work. But I think that Ricky's sound on M+A+S is really more that he is a maturing, emotionally safe, self-accepting, self-loving and honorable man whose voice seems to get better with age, fatherhood and time--not to mention that at 40 Ricky's better looking and better built than ever!<br /><br />It seems that these qualities helped to produce music that engenders a variety of emotions from one song to the next. Both of the duets on this CD are fun to sing along to. He has great duet partners in Natalie and Joss Stone. Sera Sera a fun dance song with tight beats. Shine one of only the 2 songs he sings in English, is an optimistic song of love and fun to listen to. Frio is a funky piece in both versions that makes you want to dance. Tu Y Yo cannot be accurately described in words, it has to be felt--A love song no doubt to a soul mate. It's like a poem to music, evoking the wonder of of true love and the impossibility task to describe it using human words.<br /><br />But it is Basta Ya that is the most emotionally provocative, moving of M+A+S. It seems to point to Ricky's process of coming to love himself. It might well have been written before Ricky \\"hit the send\\" button that announce to the world that he had enough of fear and self-hatred. I listen to it often--we all have fears and suffer self-hatred at many points in our lives. Basta Ya's message is for all of us.<br /><br />Thank you Ricky!

In fact I introduced my Dad and Mom to Quentin-films. I have been his DIE-HARD FAN right from RESERVOIR DOGS. In Death Proof, Quentin dons the cape of Director of Cinematography also. Kurt Russel has come a long way from his 'Snake Plisken' days. You see Death-Proof, for TOTAL & COMPLETE ENTERTAINMENT.Especially the CAR-CHASE in the second half of the movie. What's happenning guys! The girls are all GORGEOUS. And the MUSIC!!! WOW!!<br />Even 'Sin City' pales besides this movie. Even if you are not a 'fan', if you have seen KILL BILL and enjoyed the film, never ever dream of missing Death-Proof.

It contains everything that you learned in college: mass transfer, heat transfer, kinetics, etc. It also contains very practical information for the engineer involved with industry, such as steam tracing. I highly recommend this book to any chemical engineer.

B00EMXBDMA|5|Wow.  What felt like hard science fiction mixed with dark comedy and drama.  I would read this again just to enjoy it again, because I know I would.
B00006AG5N|5|This is such an amazing Elvis collection. I could listen to it all day. All of the songs that I love are on here, such as The Wonder Of You, which is such a hard song to find on an Elvis CD by the way, and Burning Love, which is an awesome song. My favorite song by far on here would have to be I Cant Help Falling In Love With You. Altogether an awesome CD

B000ZN8036|2|*alert* Filled with spoiler potential *alert*<br /><br />Portions of Into the Wild were beautiful. The natural landscapes and odd characters were often compelling. However, the end of the movie was ruinous and unappealing. Into the Wild is not a story of hope, transcendence, or overcoming. It is, instead, a story of failure.<br /><br />I'm sure many viewers will be able to relate to the main character's need to explore himself and the world around him. Emile Hirsch plays Chris McCandless very well. However, I question the logic of glorifying a life filled with what I consider bad choices. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. I will let you the viewer decide for yourself. Be aware before you decide to spend a few hours with this movie that there is no fairy tale ending.<br /><br />Nature can be cruel and Alaska is wild. McCandless saw, heard, felt and tasted things many of us will never experience. Is that admirable? Decide for yourself.
B00DJFIMW6|5|so much freaking fun and the minions are so cute. I'm having a great time and so is the kids. its a fun game for everyone.
B00AESN8XY|5|This game is awesome. I highly recommended you or anyone gets it.Even tho I beat it still love it still paying it will give you hours of fun. Worth the 1.00 if you are thinking about it just jump in and get it you'll love it
B00005JOFO|5|I must say I can't remember the last time I was affected so much by a movie. The story, acting, and visuals were superb, nearly every frame of this movie is elegant and beautiful. But the best was saved for the last. The ending is one of the most perfect put on film, subtle yet devastating in its emotional power.
B00PEVD59I|5|just leave a review and it will leave you alone so you don't feel like throwing your device across the room. the puzzled are fantastic!!! good job! =)
B00DHKKN6Q|3|It's fun. The only thing is I'm having problems with, after I finish a game, it disappears & I have to start up the whole game again. Luckily I don't loose my progress. This only happens on my kindle fire which I took in to have looked at but they couldn't find anything wrong. I have this app on my iphone, & that doesn't happen. Not sure what the deal is but it's really annoying! Otherwise, I like this game!
0375413405|5|After watching a recent movie about Julia Childs my wife was inspired to try some of the recipes featured.  It has in fact been a delight using the recipes from the cook book.  We haven't deboned a duck yet, but the Beef Bourguignon was most enjoyable.  We've learned quite a bit about culinary techniques. It's actually educational. We recommend this book.
B00G3L6KQI|4|Keeps your intrest from the start
0062082353|4|I have reviewed many books on Amazon and I've got to say this was the most difficult.  Yes, I read the entire book (although I must admit that I jumped around a little and came back to the pages unread).  What we have here is a young man who is fascinated and passionate about firearms (and he goes to great lengths talking about them).  Fortunately for you and me, Chris found a career that enabled him to make an honest living using firearms.  If it wasn't for proudly serving in the US Navy (which I am also a proud veteran), I'd hate to think of what he might have done.  American Sniper is a good read.  The input by his wife describing what it's like to live with an egomaniac (which you have to be to do what he does/did for a living) was a great touch to the book and certainly kept me reading it.  There is nothing new or revealing with regards to Navy Seal life.  Indeed there is an ample amount of killing (but that's the central theme of the book).  The story flows nicely (even though parts of it seem to get drawn out).  Now that I finished the book two days ago, I can't help but wonder that if later in Chris's life -- the psychological effects of his (justified) actions.  Like every other blue blooded American, I applaude his service and am deeply indebted to those like him because it truly takes unique individuals to keep our country free.  To those considering this book:  read it, try and understand the man who penned it but don't read to much into it because otherwise you could find yourself either enlisting in the armed forces or frustrated for even reading it.

B00EHMFC78|5|Baldacci can't be topped!  Excellent story, believable characters, superb plot!
B000Z27HLS|5|This movie is well done, even if it does seem to go a little quickly. I would have liked to have a little more depth to the whole story, but all in all it is a wonderful Jane Austen story. If you are an Austen fan then this movie is great to have for a quick fix. It is only about 1 1/2 hours long so it doesn't require a whole day to enjoy the whole thing like some of the more intricate Austen films.
1400052181|5|The book looked brand new when it got to my house. It looked as though I had gotten it from Barnes & Noble or a similar kind of store. I was very happy with my purchase.
B00KM18AP4|1|doesn't work for US Verizon version.
0307719219|4|This book explores why some nations fail and others do not. The authors lay out their thesis early on (Pages 3-4):  \\"Countries such as Great Britain and the United States  became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and created a society where political rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities.\\"<br /><br />In the process of addressing their thesis, the authors also look critically at some competing theories--geography, culture, ignorance. One comparison that serves the authors well is the fates of North Korea and South Korea, and why their well-being has diverged so widely.<br /><br />The authors provide a wide ranging analysis, including a critique of managed economies and a question about the staying power of high fliers such as China.<br /><br />One question that occurs to me, though, is how certain examples of increasing economic differences and, in the United States, Court decisions that enhance the power of economic powers might play out. Are there potential problems facing some of the democracies with increasing inequality? Only time will tell, but it is a question that arises when looking at the data.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting and important work.

B008602KQI|5|While the books are no great prose, the story is fantastic -- original and compelling. And my No. 1 criteria for a movie based on a book is that the movie not ruin the images I liked from the book.  The potential to bomb here was huge -- but this movie was quite true to the book, probably from the influence of the author but nonetheless a success.  Also, it was well-made, the acting was good, there was plenty of action, and nothing gratuitous.  I do not disapprove sex and violence in movies (in fact I rather like both in movies) -- but I downgrade where sex or violence is an obvious attempt to obscure a bad plot or is the plot.  (ok the exception is when the movie is about sex)  Anyway, here, the danger of adding gratuitous sex was high, and must have been tempting; and the plot was inherently violent.  But, the violence (including the gore) was tempered and the love scenes were true to the story and appropriate for the context.
B00TU9UFTS|5|Totally unique! 💚 Loved it.
1439175640|5|This is a great cookbook, with recipes from the famous Magnolia Bakery in New York City! I have been to NYC several times and my family and I have waited in line and hour and a half to two hours to purchase wonderful baked goods! First of all, well worth the wait!!! Secondly, those very recipes are in this book!<br /><br />OMG the \\"Peaches and Cream Pie with Sugar Cookie Crust\\" on page 171 is the best pie I have ever eaten! If you want a fabulous addition to it: reconstitute some dried apricots in apricot brandy, chop them and put them on top of this pie!!! Out of this world fabulous!!!<br /><br />All the recipes are easy to follow and wonderful to eat!!!
B003L77G2Y|5|h dear... I'm running out of superlatives to describe Fringe. You've certainly got to keep your wits about you for series three with storylines ricocheting between the `real' and `alternate' universes. The multi-layered plots twist and turn maintaining a consistent tension and intrigue while the underlying mythology is gradually developed, giving weight and depth to the whole narrative. There are a few relatively pointless stand-alone episodes which do nothing to further the ongoing story but I think these can be forgiven. The final episode is astonishingly original and more than a little confusing but with a totally unforeseen (well, by us, anyway) outcome and is peppered with references from earlier episodes (the opera house, the bridge, Peter's silver half dollar...). We even watched the last two episodes twice to make sure we'd got the right end of all of the various sticks.<br /><br />The cast are brilliant but the real star is the writing - it is equally clever if it has been fully storyboarded boarded out from the start or if it has been made up as they go a long. We're just glad that, contrary to the popular trend, this show wasn't axed early-on by short sighted and unimaginative network bean counters. Let's hope that season four, rumoured to be the last, tidies up all of the loose ends and has a satisfactory conclusion.
B000000W5L|5|And that means maybe the best ever.  A veritable journey through the American musics that created rock 'n roll, from Robert Johnson to gospel to country.  No obvious hits, unless you count &quot;Tumblin' Dice,&quot; but  a record that gets better each time you listen.

B0095P3ULC|3|Michael Bay and his Transformer movies are known more for big bangs, explosions and not really for the content.  If you are looking to have something on as a background noise, then go ahead put this movie on.  It is predictable with just an okay entertainment value.  If you need to pass the time and not really looking for an &#34;eye opening&#34; experience, then go ahead watch this movie.<br /><br />By the way, Shia LaBeouf was more than a little annoying in this movie.  What's with all the screaming?  He was throwing tantrums after tantrums in this movie.  And the love interest?  her performance was so dead-pan that I do not even remember her name.

B007J4T2G8|1|One time, a few years ago, I endeavored to read Twilight. My wife, a vampire movie fan, watched the first one and deemed it complete crap. I managed to get through about four or five chapters before I wanted to murder both Bella and Edward for being complete morons. Well, I thought, after reading the hilarious excerpts of E.L. James' Twitter Q&A fiasco, I should read through 50 Shades at least once.<br /><br />Well, not only was that about five hours I'll never get back, this book was one of the worst pieces of drivel I've ever had the misfortune to read. Poor grammar. Faulty and overblown sentence construction. Moronic overuse of e-mails as a narrative device. Padding out the book by at least two chapters by reiterating the contract Grey wanted Ana to sign THREE times. Did we really need to have the fact that Christian Grey wanted to perform anal fisting on Ana driven into our heads that many times? This book is an embarrassment to the English language.<br /><br />The memes are completely and totally correct: If Christian Grey wasn't a billionaire, this story would be about a crazed stalker in a mobile home somewhere. And like most billionaire characters, Grey isn't really a cipher - he's just a cardboard jerk. He's basically Bruce Wayne, but into spanking instead of fighting crime. And yes, I understand there are those who enjoy this sort of thing, more power to them; you have to follow your bliss. But could someone not have written it better?<br /><br />Ana's character isn't any better. The most preposterous aspect of her, besides her stupidity at getting involved in this multi-leveled abuse situation, is that we're supposed to believe that in the 21st century, she managed to get through four years of college without having her own computer (and possibly not even her own email address - it's a bit unclear on that aspect). I could understand vampires in a story like this, but there's no way I can suspend my disbelief for that.<br /><br />The characters I'd actually like to know more about, like Kate or Jose, are the ones that, of course, we'll never hear from again. Maybe if James would rewrite the book from their perspective, it's be a lot more readable.y like to know more about, like Kate or Jose, are the ones that, of course, we'll never hear from again.

B000002TPS|4|Well, if some people can say that this marvellous album was a sell out by Megadeth, a new word will have to be invented to define what Metallica did, ha, ha!<br />While RUST IN PEACE was a furious display of master technique to introduce the sheer power adn ability of the new line up, YOUTHANASIA concentrated on giving more focus, melody and great lyrics to the songs. <br />The album flows effortless from one song to another. All of them a good, there´s not a single one throwaaway or explicit filler. It´s one of the best Megadeh albums, no doubt about that. <br />The real bad turning point would come with RISK, not with YOUTHANASIA !!

B00005JN2X|5|Michael Mann's \\"Collateral\\" is as an intense, edge-of-your-seat action thriller as you'll find this summer, thanks to Mann's breathless yet elegant directorial style and the cat-and-mouse chemistry between stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Stuart Beattie's screenplay turns the screws on Max Durocher (Foxx), an amiable L.A. cabbie who suddenly finds his cab commandeered by a sociopathic hit man named Vincent (Cruise). Villainy becomes Cruise: he is gleefully charismatic in a role that is as much as possible devoid of redeeming human qualities. And Foxx really makes you feel for Max, a nice guy coasting through life who now must call on long-unused reserves of resourcefulness and cunning, simply to live through the night. There also are an unflappable L.A. cop on Vincent's trail, played by the usually very flappable Mark Ruffalo; a sexy district attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith; a malevolent drug kingpin played by Javier Bardem; and Max's disapproving mom, played by Irma P. Hall in the movie's sharpest comic relief. The photography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron makes a glittering, sprawling deathtrap of Los Angeles, adding immeasurably to the film's slick malevolence.

Okay, not all could have fit, but there were much better songs than \\"Dumb\\" and maybe even \\"Been a Son.\\" <br /> <br />The problem this seems to have is that it was just hastily put together. A lot of the great Nirvana songs were left out. All that seems here are the \\"hits\\" plus a few more that whoever made this album would think could please the fans. Only one song... ONE song, from the band's \\"Bleach\\" album is here. Two from the \\"Incesticide\\" album. Four from the \\"Nevermind\\" album. Another four from the \\"In Utero\\" album. And two more from the \\"Unplugged in New York\\" album. Then there's the unreleased track \\"You Know You're Right.\\" <br /> <br />I think people should just own all of Nirvana's albums instead of relying on this \\"greatest hits\\" album. As mentioned before, many of Nirvana's greatest songs were omitted. So... grab the band's studio albums, the live album, and seek out the other albums that contain a few Nirvana rarities (the Outcesticide series, Grunge is Dead, The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience, and more). <br /> <br />Well... it seems like the Nirvana box-set (containing 50-ish songs, I think) is about to see the light of day. Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore is gonna write some linear notes on it. Well... hopefully we finally get the Nirvana set fans have been awaiting for some time... <br /> <br />Oh yeah, like I said, skip this, wait for the box-set and buy Nirvana's other albums.

It took me a minute to get into it...maybe a few chapters, but after I didn't put it down until the end, I just had to see what was going to happen next ...Wow, what a read this turned out to be. One with a good plot that had the reader on a roller-coaster ride...with drama and fighting (omg)and the characters were simple good in that they were so believable. Overall, I was able to even saw some humor in a lots of the going on in \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\" Definitely, this title tells it all! Now, if you are in for a interesting read that is full of 'love, hate, jealous, uncertainty, denial and what ever else that comes from a new relationship' you have come to the right place for \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" will give it all to you and even more.<br /><br />Would I recommend? Yes, only be ready for some 'disaster' that will take place.

B00AJLHUA8|4|As a horror aficionado, I find that I rarely enjoy the critically acclaimed films that seem to terrify everyone else. They always have the visuals, the lighting, and the acting to get it done, but they frequently lack good writing. At the same time, most of the lower budget, under-the-radar horror flicks I enjoy are intelligently written but just don't have the visuals or the acting to back it up (and let me be clear- by \\"visuals\\" I do NOT mean CGI).<br /><br />Sinister is one of those rare horror films that combines the best qualities from both realms.<br /><br />Beginning with a chilling super-8 reel of a gruesome murder, Sinister puts the viewer on edge from the start. This is a film that does not waste its time easing anyone into the atmosphere of a horror film; it hits its viewers with a substantial amount of dark material right away, and the initial build-up is chilling. Indeed, the first hour of the film is exceptional. Rather than relying on jump-scares or gore, Sinister utilizes disturbing imagery and subtle face-in-the-background shots to create an aura of fear. Very rarely am I so impressed by the beginning of a horror film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, and for some inexplicable reason, Sinister suffers from the same problem that just about every other Hollywood horror film suffers from: a climax unworthy of the scenes leading up to it. It's difficult for me to elaborate without spoiling anything, so all I will say is that the ending is just too... Hollywood. It was abrupt, and it was way too predictable. In short, it is not how I would have chosen to end the film.<br /><br />Apart from a letdown ending, there are a few silly aspects to the rest of the movie. Ethan Hawke (who provides a superb performance in the lead role) walks around his house at night, terrified, and never once turns on a light. Moreover, the entities he encounters are unnecessarily overused. This was only mildly distracting to me but might bother others more.<br /><br />Despite my minor criticisms, I enjoyed Sinister quite a bit and still highly recommend it to horror fans. As far as \\"mainstream\\" horror films go, this is one of the better ones I have seen in recent years, and I will likely watch it again in the future. Don't be afraid to give it a try.criticisms, I enjoyed Sinister quite a bit and still highly recommend it to horror fans.

It's plodding style, avalanche of dialogue, and low production standards let the inherent magic escape. No matter how hard they try, repeating the word \\"magic\\" over and over again does not make the TV show magical.  <br /> <br />Some portions of the TV dialogue are lost in thick Yorkshire accents and unintelligible dialect, interesting only to language scholars. At the other extreme are too many wordy explanations of what we clearly saw happen and plainly heard spoken.  Just because a television script corresponds closely to a beloved book does not necessarily mean that it makes good television, or that it captures the spirit of the book.  <br /> <br />Children are capable of understanding that something special or wonderful is happening simply by watching the event take place. The 1993 movie knows this and wisely lets a picture speak a thousand words. <br /> <br />The movie version communicates a vibrant love of life. You get to know the unique, even eccentric, characters as though they were real people struggling with hardships and fears. You are drawn into the depths and heights of their emotions through the use of stunning visuals, dramatic portrayals, pithy dialogue, moments of quiet contemplation, and a serene musical soundtrack that is worth owning on its own merits.  <br /> <br />In the TV episodes, on the other hand, a lot of effort is expended but no real drama is achieved. For example, during what could be quiet, thoughtful moments of solitude, the mood is often spoiled with a voice-over or with the use of grainy film for outdoor scenes - a distracting contrast to the clear videotape used in indoor sets. I've never been made so aware of production methods and camera work. I'd rather just sit back and enjoy.  <br /> <br />The BBC actors are good and appear capable of much better performances, but the director was content with their shallow characterizations and a few instances of mumbling, garbling, and stumbling over their lines. At several points I expected to hear the director yell, \\"Cut. Try it again.\\" Unfortunately, it's not up to normally high BBC standards. <br /> <br />It's nice to have a better choice.
B000FTWB7G|3|Not many people do music like this anymore; you know the over the top heavy metal grunge hybrid that was so popular with kids in the late 90s, Live is gone, Candlebox has been snuffed out and yet Evanescence not only continues to do this type of music, they sell millions of gazillions of CDs doing it. Of course they do have the angst ridden Amy Lee to lead them, something those other bands never had.     Despite myself I really like Evanescence, the first album blew me away due to the fact that I didn't think it would ever get more than a passing glance on my CD shelf, but every now and then it ends up back on the stereo. So I figured I'd take a shot and get The Open Door. If you liked the first album, you're going to like this one. There's nothing new from the band, perhaps the songs are a tad more personal on the lyrical level, but Amy studied her Tori Amos lyric sheets and is a princess in training at lyrical ambiguity.     I can tell by her overpowering vocals and the band's rigid jumble of quiet guitars, louder and louder guitars and pounding drums that they are in pain, it's just hard to relate to what that pain is sometimes. Sometimes it's obvious, the first single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" couldn't be more direct, however that's the title, the lyrics aren't quite as simplistic, but it's still a really good songs.     In fact all the songs are really good, they're all heart wrenching and dripping with emotion, it's just that as a whole; the package can burn you out. 13 songs of bombastic woes and pain is a little too much for my little blonde head, but should I ever have a fight with my lovah, this one's going on the stereo and playing very loud.
031603441X|5|I first heard of the book in a random Rolling Stone magazine I picked up. It had excerpts of \\"Life\\" in it and I ran right out to go buy the book right then and there. No page is uninteresting. Every story is intriguing and you will marvel at Keith Richards' life from cover to cover.
B004SJ3BCI|4|I love it but I I don't play all the time
0316055433|5|.  The art descriptions and character Boris alone make the book wonderful. You may wait a while before picking up another book
B00IU5DYAA|4|I really liked this new direction Skrillex went in. Less specific emphasis on dubstep but still contains his distinct musical style. Only Coast is Clear and Dirty Vibe were overrun by the guest artists. Doompy Poomp is a hilarious and light-hearted goof-off song and people who take it seriously miss the point. Otherwise, I honestly love this album and I'm looking forward to what Skrillex does next.
B00J2PB9OU|4|Once I suspended disbelief and accepted the image of good old Walt this movie held my attention for the duration.  Both Hanks and Thompson were excellent in their roles but Giamatti's performance was the best of them all!.
B000AMJG4Y|5|I used to have this dvd before I lost it in a housefire back in 2011. I missed watching this movie so I went ahead and bought it. I'm a huge final fantasy fan and am happy to have this dvd as part of my dvd movies collection.
B000000I0J|4|There is nothing left after Bombastic Instrumental works such as \\"Incantations\\" or \\"Ommadawn\\".Mike did his first short rock album without long suites and many complicated changes.It is much more catchier but some of emotions that were in his previous albums had gone with the change of style...but it doesn't mean that the music is bad...oh no - the music here is fresh and just wonderfull....<br />The main track is \\"Platinum\\" - about 20 miuntes long suite, but divided into 4 songs...\\"Platinum suite\\" sounds a bit mechanic but is a really impressive work - especially \\"Charleston\\" part with crazy trumpets,some ghost choir and great bass line - the other parts are interesting also and Mike proves here that almost everything that he tries to play turns into gold...And also we can hear him on backing vocals here...<br />\\"Sally\\" is a nice love song, typical seventies pop style,nothing special but listenable and fun - the interesting story is that \\"sally\\"...is not the original song - Real \\"sally\\" was kind of a joke and was too silly that right after the premiere of this album Virgin records forced mike to put something more representative for the album - so he did and recorded the song \\"Into wonderland\\" that became second \\"sally\\" -The new remastered edition\\" contains \\"Into wonderland\\" instead of amusing original mix...<br />\\"I got rhythm\\" (Cover of gershwin's track) is another nice and romantic pop ballad, but features very expressive guitar solo and more interesting lyrics about how MIke is happy after finding new way and being in peace with himself...<br />The most outstanding tracks \\"Woodhenge\\" and \\"Punkadiddle\\" - first one is very dark and has a bit nervous atmosphere.strange sounds,creepy guitar and scary loud sound of Tubular bells at the end...everytime when i listen to it i have visions of some old abandoned house in a dark forest,witches and stuff like that...creeeepppyyy. While \\"Woodhenge\\" has intensive atmosphere, \\"Punkadiddle\\" is fun and fast rocker with \\"OI!!!\\" screams and catchy guitars.Also some fake audience in some moments...nice fast rocker tune...it is kind of a joke from Punk music that went high on charts and eliminated more progressive and ambitious artists like Mike off the top...<br />\\"Platinum\\" is definitly not as full of emotions and sadness as previous albums - it's much more catchier,lighter and fun to listen - very impresive music, full of positive vibrations...it sounds different too - while before in almost every moment 7 instruments and more were playing, here sometimes it is only Bass,guitar,keyboard and drums - simple but effective rock instruments...Another impressive work from Mike Oldfield....
B00CHSPB8Y|5|This game is like the best runner game never like never stop playing this game it's<br />Unbelievable you should get this game
B00A6CCF0K|5|This was one of the best King books I've read in a while. Great follow up to The Shining!!
B008Y7045C|5|sweet :)
B00IKFTOPE|4|Wasn't sure what to expect especially after reading a few of the reviews. I really liked it a lot, Since no one really knows the stories behind those that perished in Pompeii, I thought this was a very good storyline and performances by all. No Spoilers here, but the ending was different that what I had hoped for but appropriate for the story..Don't listen to the critics, watch it and judge for yourself and enjoy.
B0064X7FVE|2|I'd used this app on my Droid 2 phone for a couple of years and love it, but I downloaded it to my Android tablet and out of dozens of attempts it has actually loaded and run twice. I prefer the Weather Channel app to the other weather apps I've tried, but if it doesn't load it's useless.
B006P4FBUE|5|It is a good game it is cool and it is helpful to do my piano lessons thanks to the app it is nice thank you
B008WCP2PG|4|good
B00003ZKS1|5|This release was light years ahead of its time.  It still holds its own and is better than 99% of the music out there.  Michael Schenker is one of the all time greatest!!!
B000XUBFE2|5|Didn't want to put it down! From beginning to end it had me sucked it. A great read for anyone.
030758836X|3|\\"Gone Girl\\" was the first novel I read by Gillian Flynn. The characters are not people you root for that is for sure and they are very complex. While I do not read a lot of mystery fiction and would like to read more, this book did have suspenseful parts, but I agree with a lot of other readers in saying the ending was unsatisfying.  Ms. Flynn is a detailed writer and makes the characters very in depth. I do think some parts of the book were unrealistic, but also made the plot more interesting. I have to say most of the characters do leave a bitter taste in your mouth. I'm interested in how other people who have read this book digested the ending. Is it an amazing book? No. But it's an intense psychological read for those who enjoy that type of mystery. I'd recommend \\"Before I Go to Sleep: A Novel\\" by S.J. Watson, instead of this book, but I would not discourage anyone from reading it.
B008JGSM6G|5|The Flow Free game is very challenging and addictive. One must rely on critical thinking to form the best strategy. The more spaces used for each colored line will result in a higher score.
B00008EY9G|5|he did not have schizophrenia.  Schizophrenia is NOT split personality.
B008JGSM6G|5|This game is way too addictive.  I got my first tablet for Christmas, and its all I've been doing since then.
B0032UYFA6|5|This show just keeps getting better and better. I don't want to spoil a thing for anyone, so let me just say that this is the strongest season yet of this amazing show. Walt and Jesse get in over their heads when dealing with Gus the businessman. No idea where the show is going after the finale. Can't wait to watch Season 4!
B000002J20|1|&quot;Tales from Topographical Oceans&quot; ranks as one of the worst rock albums I've ever come across.  Two albums full of aimless noodling, pointless soloing and pretentious lyrics that will test the patience of any  listener.  Though Lou Reed's notorious in-your-face epic &quot;Metal  Machine Music&quot; receives more notoriety, this album is very similar in  that it contains no recognizable songs or any focus whatsoever.  Let the  fact that even pretensious keyboardist Rick Wakeman abandoned the band  after its release tell you all the &quot;Tales&quot; you'll ever need to  know.
B00U6SFUSS|5|Everyone should read this book.
0756405890|5|The Kingkiller Chronicles is an original and refreshing fantasy series. The prose is exceptional, the story is compelling, the plot is driven well, and the main characters complex. Rothfuss's world is amazing, and I will buy any book this man writes from now on.
B0055B7IPE|2|Not for kids.  Meaning went right by the kids, probably most adults.  Too much violence, kids were scared (4 and 7).
B00006AW2O|3|12x5: In which The Stones' U.S. record company (taking Capitol's then-current hatchet job of The Beatles' discography as some sort of twisted, greed-inspired cue) milks Mick &amp; Co. for all they were worth (striking while the iron was hot, and all that) by chopping up their UK albums into little red, white, and blue pieces for optimum profitabilty, artistic integrity be damned.  Whatever -- it was the early-sixties, after all, and no one thought these long-haired hooligans would turn into Icons.  But my question today is this:  why not release the original UK sources (&quot;Five by Five&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stones no.2&quot;) as part of the new remaster series, thereby settling a score of sorts with history?  Just a thought....
630542845X|5|I saw this movie when it first came out and my husband and I absolutely loved it.  It was one of those movies where you felt like your life had been changed when you walk out of the movie theater.  I've thought about it a couple times over the years, but figured I would probably never see it again.  Well it happened to be on a movie channel tonight and I watched it again.  It still had the same effect on me and my kids were really interested in it.  Unfortunatley, I turned it on 35 minutes after it had started and the kids still had homework to do and showers to take.  So I decided to check here to see if they sell it.  They do and I bought it immediately!  It is one movie I will LOVE to share with my kids.  It is such a powerful movie with a powerful message that is still relevent today.  I think it has a great message about how we treat people that are different.  My kids are in high school and I think that this is something that will change the way they view people that may not have the same things (i.e. looks, advantages, etc. ) that they do.
B005KELQEU|5|Though rarely used the sleeve is perfect for taking the Kindle along on trips. The Product was exactly as expected and perfectly satisfactory.
B00I1XYDUQ|5|This album is a instant classic;  love all of the songs especially the Pat Matheny  Group remake is just awesome.
B00942S4OY|5|really good
B0064TVQ5E|3|I enjoy playing it. Difficulty with changing/canceling a play. Don't like to restart.
B00TEAVEY8|5|Great game
B007ZGO7EM|5|Terrific calculator
B005LAIH54|5|A sequel to a great movie.
B007HJB6OG|3|I really enjoyed the story line.  The characters are awesome and it's as delicious as you'd expect from HBO.  But I'll be honest...the finale was a real disappointment.  I really wanted to see Ned return in the second season to destroy the Lanister empire.  To loose the most central character of the entire season (and symbol of hope) was disappointing. And I loved Khal.<br /><br />Perhaps HBO did too great of a job in the writing, because I got so enthralled.  And of course I'm writing from the female perspective.  And had the season ended the way I'd hope, maybe it would've come off a little cliched.  But I have a feeling I'm speaking for many other female audience members here. I would've eagerly purchased the second season to watch Ned and Khal kick butt.
B00GIXY4M8|4|great action, story could have been a bit more indepth. Movie moved forward fast. Watch it for fun and don't expect much more.
0439023491|5|Great Book!!!
B00F56AZK4|5|I Love these puzzles they get challenging!! The more intricate the harder they are the harder they are the better.
B00JOT3HQ2|4|Love the game friend haves it and I get it love it so so so much it is hard but fun u tap to jump and u can double jump as well
B000002OMN|5|Hmm... I don't know what to say to the people who left a negative feedback on this. I enjoy this album very much. It is hard to imagine that this  music would be a &quot;torture&quot; to anybody. Neither I am tone deaf, I  have some music education (9 years of music school). &quot;I would do  anything for love&quot; and &quot;Life is a lemon&quot; are the  masterpieces. I love the other songs too.
B005R32L66|4|have not used it much but will in the future. its a good thing
0780624890|2|The first ten minutes of this film are so visually striking that you know the climax won't outdo it so why go on watching? And thus it proves. The film starts off by risking your goodwill when a young buck is invited to a rave that uncomfortably borrows from a scene in 'Schindler's List'. Very distasteful, guys. This is an unusual rave, in any case. Ravers with a tab stuck in two fangs?  Either way, the young buck has a lucky escape as the less than friendly ravers suffer a dehydration problem rarely seen at an all-nighter.<br />Love the names in this flick. Krieger. Abraham Whistler. Dragonetti. Blade, also known as Eric *giggle*. Better than Fred, I suppose.  Is this a Phillip Ridley film?  Oh, I nearly forgot Deacon Frost. Mostly because he's hard to see without cricking your neck. He should be called Deacon Blue, he's a 'real gone kid'. In fact, he's positively dead.  Deacon Frost, who fancies himself as 'the man', has trouble stamping authority on the proceedings due to his aforementioned lack of stature. I'm sorry to hark on about it, but it's the dominating distraction in the film.  As I recall, Christopher Lee was a lot more impossing playing Dracula due to his height but Dorff reminds me of an anorexic Freddie Starr, although he won't be eating any hamsters.  They're taller than he is. His dress sense doesn't do him any favours in the world domination stakes either, his natty seventies puce velvet suit and flares invokes pity rather than terror.  Dorff's face betrays the fact that the material is beneath him and it's hard to imagine anything getting beneath this diminutive Nosferatu (I know the lingo!) Anyway, truculent and obviously suffering from an inferiority complex, he noticeably stays on his feet around a conference table of distinctly wishy-washy vampire mafiosi. Unfortunately,  when he eventually sits down in a leather chair he practically disappears altogether. He needs to get out more, which being a vampire is hard. Or is it? in a very funny scene he gets to go out in broad daylight by wearing make up.  What about his eyes and hair?  Don't their clothes usually set fire anyway? perhaps he greased them up too. Hey, slimy guy, slimly suit. But to get back to Deacon's height problem which I'm trying not to do, but can't help it. I mean,  forget Blade, they should have got Buffy the vampire slayer to tackle him, at least they'd be eyeball to eyeball. With Blade, Deacon Frost is eyeball to, well, modesty prevents me. Anyway, this means war, albeit from Lilliput.  The world's too small for both of them, and Mr Frost is too small to even audition for a remake of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (why can't they make em like they use to?) But as I said before, I'll try not to mention it. You know, THE GLARING HEIGHT THING. There are more important considerations. Such as Wesley Snipes who plays Blade with the usual nonchalance we wearily expect from him. He is aided by a doctor played by N'Buste Wright in a performance so flat you could fax her to the set.  Her indifference to the sudden knowledge of the existense of vampires could make her an early target for recruitment by the 'Utraviolet' vampire squad (based in the UK) who memorably acted as if they were working in a mundane capacity for the local council.  Ms Wright has an archetyple James Bond moment when she is tossed into a cell to face something nasty but is blessed with possibly the biggest air vent in film history to crawl out of. Kris Kristofferson fairs better as a grizzled old vampire hunter and is rather fun.<br />Since the advent of video games, Hollywood has felt an unnecessary need to compete with the former's kineticism with predictably silly and tedious results and the trend sadly shows little signs of abating.  Vampiric.
B00005LC1H|5|Great series.  John Cleese has once again made me laugh so hard!
B009JBZH54|5|This item was ordered as a Christmas present for my nephew and it arrived on time just as it was promised.
0783242808|5|LOL! this is totally halarius! I laughed a lot with this movie, dude is it funny! It's pretty sick, but funny! It's pry one of the best comedies youll see if you like the whole tom green type of comedy, its so funny!
0452289963|5|This book is must read, it is the 2nd best book I have ever read the first being \\" A Return to Love\\".  Buy this book you will not regret it.
B0071DJZZA|5|Wendy Scott, fantasy author, [[...]]. Couldn't put it down, needed to find out what was going to happen next. Well written, tightly paced and I cared about the characters. Downloaded the second book as soon as I finished the first.
1582701709|5|May daughter  happy when she had this book , she kept read al time forgot take a lunch ! Good book .
B008FPOIT6|4|I read this book as part of my book club. I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Robin Sloan writes well and kept his story enjoyable and entertaining. He truly kept a great perspective on past, present and future.<br /><br />I loved the story...a secret society that is trying to translate a five-hundred year old coded written masterpiece in order to learn the secret to immortality. The use of book stores to recruit new members to the society. And I loved the outcome.
B00FATEJYE|3|It's not letting do an online battle I try to log in and it says I have only 12 characters when I really have 30
B009ZXT4BY|5|it's awesome but it would've been better if you could play as long as you like it's awesome though I taught a horse class and the game ended in the middle of class anyway my class is a class of chaos!
B007D2XSW0|5|this app is an easy app to use.... quick and easy. but if the kindle fire had a camera on it it would probably be alot funner! ya i said funner!
B00CSR2J9I|4|I think that hill climb racing but you always got to die easy.But it is not as fun as happy.weeks.
B0042VJ1PI|5|It's a GREAT read & I was hooked from page 1! Highly recommend this book to anybody who loves mystery books that keep you guessing to the last page!
B00VFTD43A|5|This was based upon a true story. Benedict Cumberbatch once again was brilliant in his performance. Ms Knightly also help round the story out in many areas and was crucial to the story. The telling of how the first computer was designed and successfully worked for a major project is a interesting and exciting show.  I would give this  motion picture a five star rating.
B0091REZMW|3|Very repetitive.  Unless you pay money you have to keep looking for the same stuff in each room.  It gets boring after awhile.
B00E8B1358|4|But it wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion.<br /><br />I much prefer a more action based movie to the cloak and<br />dagger situations.
B008Z9YLV2|5|Great movie!  Great action and acting. I found it to be very entertaining and recommend  it!
B00000I5Y6|5|This is good low cost start for someone getting into Kansas for the first time. It has all the hits even play the game tonight. The pinnacle and devil game were great additions to this cd.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Excellent acting!
B000NY12CI|4|If you want to understand current geo-politics and how did we get to this point, then read this biographical account of awakening and redemption
B00AB7HESI|5|i really like the app and the game its self is awsome i really recommend this app it is good for adults and children
B007SYWFRM|4|Its alright.  The little games in the big game are fun.  The kids like it.  The movie was great.  try it.  best of luck.
B008AK8FHM|5|This book was a great read with wonderful imagery of his journey into the afterlife.  Some points got too technical regarding the medical jargon, but it did play a vital part in the book.
B003JTHXOK|5|I love all of Nicholas Sparks books!  I have read Safe Haven twice! His books draw you in and you don't want to put the book down.
B00RNRD7Y4|3|Not as good as expected.  Just rented it to see what all the hype was about.
B004XJRQUQ|5|A plot that grabs you and never lets go.  I haven't cared so much about the characters in I don't remember when.  The world we see is presented in absorbing detail, and what we don't see (what we get hints of) I'm longing to see.  Highest marks for the story.  Low marks for the Kindle formatting: type size changes at various points, and I have to change preferences to compensate (always possible so far, but a pain).
B005LAII80|4|This disc gets a 1 STAR rating from me due to the LACK of 3D! NO DEPTH! You could watch this in the 3D mode without the glasses, and the image is, for the most part, normal (not blurry)?!! Another disc that fails to make it in my 3D collection!!! Oh Dredd... almost leaves you wanting the Stallone/Schneider version instead?<br /><br />UPDATE...<br />Changed the rating to a 4 star.<br />Seems I must have had one of those defective disc?? Due to some people saying the 3D was great, I figured I'd chance buying Dredd again... this time from the UK site, in hope of a better result?! Turns out the UK version worked great. Noticed it right from the begining with the opening credits of red text on black background. There was definatley depth in the text, which isn't seen on my previous US purchase!<br />It just gets better from there!!
1401201911|5|Mark Millar is a genius. His deconstruction of the DC universe is fascinating and brilliant. His depictions of Superman, Lex, Batman, and Wonder Woman show the depth's of Millar's understanding of the comic world.
B00004ZAV3|5|The Beatles were more than &quot;4 lads from Liverpool&quot; they are part of our culture and history.  For those of you that didn't grow up with the Beatles you missed out !  I remember calling record stores to see when new albums were in stock and listening to the radio for the next Beatle song.  You never get tired listening to these tunes.  The genius of the Beatles was the magic they created together !  These songs are great to listen to in the car and sing to...
B00280LYIM|5|This book truly kept my attention and I just wanted to read more and more. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a suspenseful adventure that leaves you wanting more.
B005CRQ4GU|4|This book was very funny and then the book was loosing the excitement.so I didn't like it much at all
B000001FKY|5|Can't get any better.
B000KX0IOK|4|Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) doesn't have his act together.  He takes his junior high history class through an impromptu exercise in history.  There are some methods to his madness, but not all the synapses are firing.  Mainly his.  He's also the girls' basketball coach.  And it is after one of their many losses that he enters the abandoned girls' locker room and lights up crack cocaine in the bathroom stall.  One of the friendlier students, Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him strung out on the floor.  To save face, he takes her home, for her honest earning mom can't shuttle her daughter around.  She's not a soccer mom like in the suburbs.  On the sidelines, Dan parties with acquainances, including Drey's brother (Anthony Mackie) who is a drug dealer.  Drey keeps all things under her hat, and both coach and pupil develop a chummy relationship while Dan tries futilely to keep it professional.  At school, Dan makes connections in history about opposites conflicting with one another as a key component of history.  In the movie we make connections with the full cycle of the drug market from dealer to consumer.  (Even though the focus is more of a tight-knit drama and an examination of the characters than the subject matter, unlike an expose' like 'Traffic'.)    Gosling gives a worthy Oscar nominee performance showing the subtlety of drug addiction like few others.  Mostly, other movies present it as more dramatic and less pedestrian.  We see his life slowly unravel as he becomes irritible about every interruption in the everyday chain.  At one point he throws a ball at the referee who seemed to be asleep at the wheel.  It is to their credit that filmmakers Ryan Fleck and Anna Borden, et al, provide a movie where he slowly loses footing in most major foundations of his life.  Once he spirals, colleagues begin to see that his life is amiss, but faithful Drey keeps her concern to the end.  Shattering but subtle, 'Half Nelson' creeps up on the viewer as well as the protagonist with a sincere presentation.
B00FZM8Z7I|5|For Granddaughter birthday. Way too pricy but that is what she wanted.
B001FAZYOQ|5|In my opinion, this is a must for any David Bowie fan.  David Bowie fans, you know who you are.  You will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5|I think it is a good app for kids if they like to have fun on apps and I would recommend plants vs zombies or stupid zombies.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Best game! It is so much fun to play!
0061950726|5|I am thrilled that Christina Baker Kline decided to write about this topic because it was unknown to me.  It kept my interest throughout the entire read and I found it fascinating that this topic was never really brought out to the public.  I read plenty of books, but this was the fist I have come across on this topic.  Although it saddened me much, I thought the writing was superb.  Thank you for writing such a great book…..
B009EEQL6A|4|This has Denzel: four stars right there.  It's not his best though.  Still the supporting actors do a good job and I just love the train stuff.
0385732554|5|I read the Giver because it was my kids were assigned to read it in school.  I am so happy I did.  While it was written in 1994, it's message that becomes more true by the day.  Sixteen years later we have more people on anti-depressants than ever, as if we can't handle our emotions.  Will we reach a point where we'll do anything to keep from feeling bad?  Trouble is, if we reach that point, we also won't feel anything good.<br /><br />Jonas, the twelve year old hero of the story is shown all the memories that his society has buried in able to bring peace to his world.  He also discovers what happens to the less than perfect children.  Armed with the truth, Jonas can make his own decision about his society and he does.<br /><br />I believe this book is as important as 1984, Brave New World, and any other book that shows us where the road we're currently on is going to take us.  Thank goodness for brilliant authors like Lois Lowry who have the talent, skills and courage to bring these things to our attention.  I hope this book remains on the must-read list for students for many years go come.<br /><br />[...]
