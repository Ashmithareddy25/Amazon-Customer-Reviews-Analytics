B00005KFUM|5.0|I got this cd because I was impressed with Muse's debut album 'Showbiz.' I expected more of the same, but got something so, SO much better. and the production of the cd is spectacular.<BR>These guys know how to blend electronica with rock, creating beautiful songs such as New Born, Micro Cuts, and Bliss. Matthew Bellamy still uses his voice with as much feeling as he did in Muse's first cd. After the first two tracks (New Born and Bliss) there is a transitional song called Space Dementia. The piano and vocals make the song beautiful while also rocking, which prepares the audience for the next three totally rocking songs, Hyper Music, Plug In Baby, and Citizen Erased. Plug In Baby features my favorite guitar riff of all time, it has no beginning and no end. <br />The second half of the cd is not as strong as the first half, but it is still superb. Micro Cuts takes the volume down a notch to set up the next song, a soft melody called Screenager. The enxt two songs, Dark Shines and Feeling Good, are the weakest, I feel, although still good. The cd closes with a smooth song featuring an actual organ, this song is called Megalomania and it is the perfect song to close the cd.
0316666343|3.0|A very captivating and charming book, at least for the first half.  It began to drag towards the middle.  I felt as though the author had been pressed by editor/critics to lengthen the story, but she was unable to make the most of it in the end.<br />There should have been more development of the murdered girl's hunt for the killer.  Sebold hints at this, but seems to reject that side of the story for fear of appealing to sensationalism.  The conclusion of the story does nothing to bring about the girl's conception of heaven, which I thought was the main part of the story.  Her heaven doesn't get much different at all.  The victim is told to shake off the burden of her murder; in fact negativity seems to pervade her heaven all the more in the end, until she's surrounded by dead people!  This is heaven?<br />Still, an involving and interesting read.

B00000DGUG|5.0|Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is perhaps one of the greatest albums ever recorded. It portrays the feelings and emotions of many individuals including myself that inspires us to make some kind of change in this world.<BR>&quot;Front Row&quot; Would have to be the best track of the album, along with &quot;The Couch,&quot; &quot;I was hoping,&quot; and &quot;Would Not Come&quot;<BR>I would definitely encourage people to buy this excellent album.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After reading few negative reviews prior to the release of Hail to the Thief, I had braced myself for disappointment in the album despite my year-long anticipation of its release.  I was worried that Yorke et. al. would retreat too far from their more experimental, dare I say avant garde KID A and Amnesiac.  Startled by negative reviews from squeamish critics they might have retreated from their invention and homogenized to a more commercially viable product at the expense of their art.  But Radiohead's Hail to the Thief successfully &quot;drifts&quot; backward-- drawing from the best aspects of their past music while innovating in concept and form.  The album is brilliant-- at least as accessible as OK Computer and The Bends, but lyrically and musically cutting and startling, despite. The chord progressions, in my estimation the most cliche-vulnerable component of pop music, are consistently innovative and jazz-like (melodic yet not entirely predictable);<BR>the electronica/sound collage is gracefully and evocatively employed throughout (see track 2's ending in particular.) The lyrics deserve close study, offering at times a nursery-rhyme-like political critique that is ambiguous enough to intrigue repeatedly and differently with each examination. The effect is vivid and avoids the obvious. Hail to the Thief is a complete, compact, polished work of art.     --CJC
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is definatly worth buying!!! I unfortuantly downloaded this cd at one time but i liked it so much i went straight out and bought it. They have a similar sound to New Found Glory, and Starting Line. Any fan of pop punk will enjoy this cd. THe best tracks are \\"One Day\\", \\"Perfect\\", and \\"I'd Do Anyhting\\" Go Out and buy this cd as soon as possible. This is a group of guys we dont have to BLAME CANADA for, because they really rock!!!
B00005JM1D|3.0|Old School (2003) Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jeremy Piven, Ellen Pompeo, Juliette Lewis, Leah Remini, Perrey Reeves, Sean William Scott, Andy Dick, D: Todd Phillips. Average comedy about three buddies in their early 30s reliving their college years when one of them suggests forming their own fraternity-by bringing together middle-aged guys, university misfits, and an 89-year-old retiree-but an old foe, now the Dean of Students holds a grudge against them. Good casting, some very funny lines and situations, and the crudity is more restrained than usual, but without telling, it's simultaneously nave and covers no new ground as the ANIMAL HOUSE school. This movie definitely separates the men from the boys. Fact: Ferrell doesn't do well with nudity, in his streaking scene. Snoop Dog, Warren G., The Bishop Don Magic Juan, and Phillips all give cameos. Available in unrated version, which runs 2 minutes longer. Running Time: 90 minutes and rated R for strong sexual content, nudity, and language.
B000002ILG|5.0|Ok, so the singer looked like Fabio. I don't care what anyone says about the 1980's or this band. This is pound for pound one of the 5 great pop-metal (I hate labels) albums of the late-1980's. Vito Bratta's guitar playing is incredibly tasteful throughout and always goes hand-in-hand with his terrific acoustic guitar parts and passages. In fact, one might even make the assumption that Vito was in fact the most tasteful guitarist of the genre (I dare you to find anyone else who would've restrained themselves during the solo to &quot;When the Children Cry&quot;). Interestingly, this album has NO negativity to it whatsoever-it's overall themes and messages are unrelentingly positive and encouraging. The real crime here is that Vito and co. were rewarded for their superb songwriting by being tossed aside so that Kurt Cobain could write about deoderant and incest. If you want to get a disc that never lets you down and boasts both chops and songwriting, pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.
B00008K7AM|2.0|Hot Chick, The (2002) Rob Schneider, Rachel McAdams, Anna Faris, Matthew Lawrence, Eric Christian Olsen, Robert Davi, Melora Hardin, Alexandra Holden, Sam Doumit, Tia Mowry, Tamera Mowry, Adam Sandler, D: Tom Brady. Low-humored duplicate of FREAKY FRIDAY-a Happy Madison production, about a thirty-something bandit waking up in the bed of a popular, cold fish cheerleader due to a pair of magical earrings from Abyssinia that has the power to switch bodies. You've seen it done many times before and many times better than this. Lackadaisical comedy can be amiable and tepid . . . but tries too hard to be funny with dopey and offensive jokes. And Brady wrote and directed films at Harvard? Schneider co-wrote and Sandler co-produced. Running Time: 101 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language, and drug references.
B000000OPZ|5.0|My friend gave me a hard time when he saw that I own this disc, so I kicked him in the nuts. Rightfully so. There's nothing funny about this [booty] kicker. John Sykes could shred the pants off of anyone in 1987 and yet, he could write a great tune or two as well. \\"Still of the Night\\" is a powerful tune that has a great breakdown complete with strings and a guitar solo that is so fast, it would undoubtedly [stun] that kid Mikey on the Life cereal box. The #1 hit \\"Here I Go Again\\" and the #2 hit \\"Is This Love\\" are also both here, providing the album with sincere pop songs and ultimately pushing it over the top. Fans of early Whitesnake immediately complained about how this album was a sellout when it was relased in 1987. However, anyone who heard \\"Slide It In\\" in 1984 would've known that this was the direction that Coverdale was heading, so stop whining. I won't review this album song by song, I will simply tell you that this disc is full of slick pop ditties that feature outrageous chops and some heartfelt guitar playing from Sykes (Is This Love?) It's a shame that Coverdale canned this lineup following it's completion because Dave really had a thoroughbred here. Great album. Great guitar playing. Great songwriting. Get it and see what you think.
B00005JLYU|3.0|Charlie's Angels: Full Trottle (2003) Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Demi Moore, Bernie Mac, Justin Theroux, Robert Patrick, Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, Crispin Glover, John Cleese, Tommy Flanagan, John Forsythe (voice), Shia LaBeouf, Rodrigo Santoro, D: McG. Second go-round of summer popcorn to the first empty-header has the trio of sexy angels, again, disguising themselves this time, as motor cross bikers from forensic scientists to sailor strippers down to nuns, and square off with their voluptuous and idolized \\"fallen angel\\" (Moore). Bill Murray as their operative assistant, Bosley is missing in action, but Mac cleans up the spot nicely as his brother. Still with nothing at its core or even not many brain cells, this is typically noisy, fun eye-candy (and the cast seems to be having fun) that works well to showcase the three-cough-four hot things, with a lot more sexual innuendos mixed in with the one-liners and references to various movies. Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, Bruce Willis, Pink, Carrie Fisher, Jaclyn Smith, and others give cameos. Barrymore produces again. Running Time: 108 minutes and rated PG-13 for action violence, sensuality, and language/innuendo.
B00006M183|5.0|Quite possibly the most underrated album of the millenium.  This album captures music of today at it's best.  Personally, I don't want to hear about some dude at a party, or about going to the mall, or about doing drugs or any of that crap you hear on the radio.  I want to hear about relevent topics in music.  SO...<br />When listening to music, I don't like an album that just completly grabs me in with a catchy chorus.  I want something that I have to really listen to carefully to pick up what's really going on.  Why? Because songs with the catchy chouruses that you hear on the radio get very old very quick.  Music that you have to listen to several times doesn't...music like \\"Riot Act\\"<br />But anyway, it's a great album and you should pick it up.  But if you don't want to, I don't really care.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|Blade II (2002) Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlman, Luke Goss, Leonor Varela, Norman Reedus, Thomas Kretschmann, D: Guillermo del Toro. Loud, bloody, slice-and-dice retread to the loud, bloody, slice-and-dice predecessor again has Marvel Comics' wisecracking night warrior, The Day Walker defeating vampires. This time, he sides with a band of his hard-hitting enemies to take on something they both have never encountered:  a vicious super-vampire that is making its own type of vampires. Spectacular special effects and style, which are more confident this time, get in the way of the mythology of vampires and crucially the story; the movie also turns mind numbing and grotesque. Running Time: 117 minutes and rated R for strong persuasive violence, language, some drug use, and sexual content.
0385509456|5.0|Many readers have discussed this novel and its use of a young autistic's voice in unraveling a murder, and other mysteries. While the book is a very absorbing read on that level (and I highly recommend it), the reader may discover fresh insights after the book is finished.<br />What I have not yet seen discussed is the way the young narrator examines the nature of Truth and its relationship to Time, and how the he realizes that Time is nothing but a frame in which to view Truth. Accordingly, Christopher's understandings of numerous Truths in the book change with Time. Past events which Christopher has understood as True are not necessarily so, and in his mind future events are simply Truths that have yet to happen. This realization is masterfully and somewhat unexpectedly (at least to this reviewer) revealed as the book unfolds. As someone whose entire life (past and future) revolves around absolute Truths, the effect of any introduced uncertainty to Christopher's world is shattering.<br />Though I have worked with communication-challenged young people, this book made me aware of a unique perspective on how such individuals may come to understand what is Real and True and reach an understanding of the world which is vastly different from the world that most of us filter, but no less True. It has changed my understanding of perception forever.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Austin Powers In Goldmember (2002) Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles, Michael Caine, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green, Verne Taylor, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Fred Savage (and his mole), D: Jay Roach. Hilarious retread, overfull with both fresh and routine gags, rejoices Austin Powers in his third movie, where this time a Dutch roller-skater/lover of gold/criminal mastermind named Goldmember (Myers) kidnaps Power's father Caine and takes him to Dr. Evil's lair. Austin's new flame and partner is Foxxy Cleopatra (Knowles) and she's a whole lot of woman! Opens with a strong and unforgettable introductory laugh, and includes a fountain joke, some with subtitles, more off-the-wall shadow gags, and a surprising finale twist put in for fans. On the contrary, has the shagadelic hero himself lost his mojo? Danny DeVito, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Katie Couric, Britney Spears, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, John Travolta, and the Osbournes all give cameos. Running Time: 94 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude humor and language.
0393057658|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said the book is enlightening and troubling. <br />One thing I would add is that although the book is well-written (Lewis tells a great STORY), the author seems unable to distance himself from his subject, and I found that slobbering annoying at times. Lewis's tone implies that Beane and DePodesta can do no wrong, and everyone else is stupid, ignorant or both. That is inaccurate, but I guess if one is admitted to the inside circle and has access to the major powerbrokers in order to write a book on this subject, perhaps one's judgement might be co-opted. <br />I'm a hardcore A's fan, and believe me I appreciate Beane and DePodesta's work, but it might have helped to do more interviews outside the organization to get another perspective on team-building. Lewis paints a convenient picture of 'Us' vs. 'Them', which I doubt is completely accurate.<br />On the positive side, I can't wait to read Lewis's next book in which he follows up on the 2002 draft class.
0345448898|5.0|I hate it when people compare these books to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, because they are something completely original.  I love this books.  The ideas are kind of complex for kids, but anybody could enjoy these.  There's not exactly much to say except that these books are incredible, and recommended to anyone with a little imagination.
B00006RJHG|3.0|I just watched this film for the first time after buying a used video from Amazon.com. I have never heard of the film before, so I came to it w/o bias or expectation. Black Christmas is a mixed horror film. It succeeds in certain areas, but fails miserably in others. It's success rest soley in the creepy phone caller and the phone calls themselves. They are genuinely creepy. It's other success rests in the performance of Olivia Hussey. The main failures come from the other characters, actors, the production values, and the writing. Margo Kidder, although a very capable actor, plays a very annoying character that is so overbearing and stupid that it detracts from the suspense of the film. Also, the house mom, although played well, is too comedic, and breaks the mood, and she's feautured too much in the film. Also, even though it's Christmas, you'd really never know it from the movie, except for the caroling scene.  I'm sure this film had a limited budget, but it could have been a much better film with better production and better writing. But having said that, I would still recommend the film. Unlike most reviews, I'm a tough critic. This film clearly isn't worthy of 5 stars, but it is worth a look.
B00009TB5G|5.0|So get over it and enjoy true epic cinema.  Be grateful Miramax passed, or all three books would have been crammed into ONE movie!! Watch the extras and you understand why changes were made from the original text, and you might find yourself approving more often than not.  The brilliance is in the details, as nothing was done half-heartedly.  Achieving character depth in a movie is no simple task, and this is where LOTR stands out.  This movie has easily jumped passed some of my all-time favorites, and I look forward to ROTK like no other movie in recent memory.<br />p.s. There is nothing wrong with liking the book over the movie, OR VICE VERSA.  What matters most is that you are immersed in Tolkien's vision and appreciate that after 60+ years, this story still has meaning in our everyday lives.
0380789035|3.0|Hard to believe that the Hugo Award is going to such a mediocre book.
B000006E4C|5.0|... even my son (7 years old ) likes it!<br />I wonder how much pop culture has actually flown into this piece of otherwise 'classical' music. Amazing, how 'electronic' the pieces sometimes sound; I had to read the liner notes several times, to find only pianos, marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, maracas, violins, celli, bass clarinets, clarinets, altos, sopranos... It reminds me at at times of Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells\\" or Jean-Michel Jarre's \\"Equinoxe\\" or \\"Oxygene\\"...<br />Nevertheless: Wonderful music, many colors and timbres riding on a smart and original minimalistic (may SR forgive me!) backbone of rhythm and pulse. At the end of the day of course: Hands down, five stars, for both, composition and performance (with composer!).
B00005JLU1|5.0|This is an amazing movie!!!!!!!!! it's crazy and wild and just plain fun to watch.  It never gets old and I notice something new every time i see it (which has been quite a few times).  If you love Johnny Depp (how could you not?!?!?!)  YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!
B00005J4HH|5.0|....matt bellamy has an incredible amount of emotion in his voice, but god bless him for not whining.  the lyrics don't revolve around having your heart boken, but they seem to mean something all the same.  and as for the music - the composition is amazing.  within the first minute of \\"citizen erased\\" (the first song i heard) i was hooked.  i think you will be too.
0786867973|5.0|When I buy a cookbook the first thing I do when I get home is sit down and read it word for word, just like a regular book. This book kept me entertained for hours on end and it still does when I decide to read it again. Nigella is very gifted and really knows how to write. Luckily, not only is it a good read, but it contains fantastic recipes as well. It is a large book, and I haven't tried near all the ones I've wanted to, but I've tried 5 and they have all turned out beautifully.
0312305060|5.0|It may be true that not much &quot;happens&quot; in this book (as some have criticized) if what you are looking for are numerous plot twists or cliffhangers.  This is not that type of novel.  It traces a day in the life of three women in different time periods; each story is told separately and it is not clear at the outset how or if their stories are connected.  Yet gradually it all comes together in Cunningham's elegant, beautifully crafted work.  This is the type of book that creeps up on you.  The observations are subtle yet deeply poignant.  When I finished it, I wanted to read it again.  I had been on a journey without knowing it; when I finally reached the destination, I wanted to take it again.  This was clearly a labor of love for Cunningham.  Few books in recent memory have moved me as The Hours did.
B000092ZYX|5.0|At first listen you might be thinking, hmm, this sounds a bit average.  But like OK and Kid A, this one just needs 5-10 listens and it begins to take off.  Song 5 is out of this world. They are the best around and have proved it again.  Spending the time to get into Radiohead's somewhat esoteric sounds is so worthwhile as the album keeps on giving and giving after that.<br />Just my opinon....
B000099T2L|2.0|I've been a fan of Destiny's Child since Writing's in the Wall, when girl power and wit ruled over image.  Beyonce alone was the driving force behind this trio's ubersuccessful career spanning the late 90s and early 00s.  However, the group decided to split momentarily to pursue their own artistic endeavors.  Beyonce failed to impact radio listeners with her first solo single WORK IT OUT, whereas her Destiny's Child counterpart, Kelly Rowland, had a number one hit and grammy nomination at hand.  Beyonce thankfully cooks up one of the best singles of her career, Crazy in Love.  However, the album's quality greatly suffers from one far too many ballads.  She offers undeniable funk and mystique in the first four tracks, most notably in her Sean Paul duet in Baby Boy, bound to be a commercial radio hit.  These home run impressions fail to outweigh its most obvious shortfall: her tendency to sing about love, endlessly.  Perhaps I had my hopes set too high.  Maybe I'm trying too hard finding a worthy successor to Aaliyah, my generations most prolific RnB artist.  Nevertheless, Beyonce has a long way to go before she can consider herself a true artist.
6301886143|5.0|Third time proves lucky in this go-round, which manages to pack in an excellent story similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, the fun humor of Temple of Doom, and manages to top both in excitement and thrills, as well as being the first Indy film to deliver genuine characterizations.  <br />There are a lot of great setpieces in this installment, making it hard to pick out which is best.  Personally, my favorite is the ten-minute tank chase, which packs in so many dilemmas, it's exhilarating how Steven Spielberg tightly directs this sequence without a hitch.
B000092ZYX|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how some music fans want, even expect, a band to keep making the same album over and over again.  They claim to be huge fans of a band/artist because of one stellar release, and then can't handle it when the band evolves.  How a true music fan can stand to see an artist run in place like this has always puzzled me, and the mixed reviews of everything released by Radiohead since OK Computer are one of the best examples of this.  Radiohead is one of the few bands with the ambition, and more importantly the guts, to boldly expiriment with new sounds and song structures while taking the chance of possibly (although they sometimes seem to do it purposely) alienate their fan base.  Kid A and Amnesiac had their moments (ie. &quot;How to Dissappear Completely&quot;, &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, &quot;Idioteque&quot;, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, Knives Out&quot;, &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, and &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; to name a few), but nothing that could touch OK Computer as a whole.  But the experiments were a natural evolution towards Hail to the Thief, and now that we have finally seen where the path lead to, the boring/annoying moments of Kid A and Amnesiac are easily forgiven.  Make no mistakes, this is Radiohead's best album to date.  It took a few listens to learn the song structures, but once you put in the time it is more than rewarding.  This is truly a band that has finally found its groove.  This is a perfect blend of all thats come before.  The most obvious is the electronic stuff, but it is used to better effect than on eithere Kid A or Amnesiac.  Theres the denseness and intelligence of OK Computer.  Theres the strong melodies and beautiful singing of The Bends, and if you really listen hard you can hear Thom's return to the bitterness of Pablo Honey (remember &quot;Thinking About You&quot;?).  Headphones are a big help for this album because there are so many idiosyncracies that each song demands, and deserves, your full attention.<BR>Each song has its great moments, and once you start to learn the album, you can't wait to hear them.  And there are some standout tracks here (ie. &quot;A Punchup at A Wedding&quot;, &quot;Backdrifts&quot;, &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;, and the INCREDIBLE closing track &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;) that are some of the bands best songs.  If you have bought the album and weren't crazy about it the first few times around, keep at it, you won't be sorry.  And if you are looking or hoping that the band would step backwards to The Bends and OK Computer(remember this is Progressive Rock, Progress means FORWARD), then forget about Radiohead, because they have moved on from that time in thier career.  Instead, check out the band Palo Alto's self titled debut because thats closer to &quot;Old&quot; Radiohead than Thom, Colin, Ed, Johnny, and Phil will ever be again.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Although the movie itself only has one song added into it which is rather out of place, the digital mastering and added crispness of the sound and animation make this DVD great.  Having only seen a few of the special features they were rather intriguing.  Lots of previews in here for a failing Disney, but this is Disney back in top form with a DVD definitely worth grabbing.  They even went back and took out the ah, \\"dirty words\\" that had made their way into the original movie and VHS.  Great quality in picture and sound for one of the best animated films to date.
B000002N2P|4.0|Me being a huge Green Day fan enjoy this CD very Much but if someone who never heard Green Day and asked me to recomend them a CD for them to listen to I definently would recomend them this one(I'd recomend Dookie or Kerplunk)<br />This is green Day trying to be a punk as they can even though they were never hugely punk sounding. On Dookie the sound was More melodic and better written I think while in this CD its Darker, Heavier, and very Brooding. <br />My favourite tracks are Armatage Shanks(Most melodic), Brain Stew(Coolest Riff on the CD), Panic song (Best Lyrics), and Stuck with me.<br />So to rap it up a really good CD But also their worst.
B000089RVX|3.0|When I first heard &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, I was hooked with the voice of the wonderful singer, Amy Lee.  Like all &quot;good&quot; singles, they start being overplayed around the country and soon dies out [in my opinion, anyhow].  Don't get me wrong, I still like the song, but not opposed to the first time I heard it.  <br />The album begins with &quot;Going Under&quot;, which is a song bound to get stuck in your head.  &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is still a classic, I see it is still in the top ten at Launch.com.  My favourite songs would have to be &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Tourniquet&quot;.  <br />&quot;Haunted&quot; brings a unique, eerie sound to the whole album, proposed to as &quot;Imaginary&quot; which is sung about candy, colours, flowers.<br />&quot;Taking Over Me&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;My Last Breath&quot;, and &quot;Whisper&quot; are the only songs on this album I give thumbs down.  Why?  The lyrics and tunes sound redundant (they are definately overdoing it, I understand that they're a &quot;dark&quot; band).<br />If you're the kind of person who gets tired of the same music easily, I recommend getting something else.
B00008WT49|5.0|To WHC4: The CD layer on the hybrid SACD is 100% identical to the CD only version, so if you are hearing differences, it's psychological.
6305280762|5.0|You should know the story, and have probably seen this movie at least once, so I'll spare the synopsis.<br />This was a movie made with big names, great actors, and actually very believable and realistic special effects, and sets - long before the days of computer enhancement.<br />Even if you know how it will all end, you'll be drawn in again and again. A truly great movie, now available on DVD at an exceptional price. This movie is actually good to share with a whole new generation (small children may find the subject matter a little frightening), and holds it's own very well against more modern movies of the genre. One of the biggest and best disaster movies EVER made. Enjoy!!!
B00009V7RF|3.0|As a fan since their first album, I was a bit worried after seeing some early criticism of the new Elephunk album.  Turns out, some of it was justified, as the sound is more mainstream and Justin Timberlake does, in fact, appear on the album (in mercifully small amounts).  The overall sound and production of the album is very impressive and new addition Fergie has an incredible voice and, if anything, is underused in her debut effort.  Main problem with this album is the lack of lyrical originality and sophistication that was more evident in Bridging The Gap.  Starts out with mostly dance anthems, notable one is Let's Get Retarded, which despite being repetitive is pretty tight and moves to, in my opinion the best track by far, Shut Up, and then on to some Latin tracks.  The album sort of loses cohesion after that with some funk and rap-rock followed up by the pleasant, but nearly vapid Where Is The Love.  Despite what another reviewer may have written, it is not nearly the best song in the world, let alone the best on the album.  So to sum up, this album may be great by mainstream hip-hop standards, but by BEP standards I'd rate it a 3.  Check out Bridging The Gap, which was phenomenal, and if you're up for top flight stuff check out the latest from other rap artists like Talib Kweli and The Roots.
B00006LPES|2.0|I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these \\"critically acclaimed\\" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying \\"What?\\"
0142004235|5.0|This book has been a joy to read and it is one book that is certainly worth reading again.  East of Eden will have a permanent spot on my bookshelf - a book that I plan to keep for my young daughter, so she can read it when she's older.  It is a timeless classic.
B00008DDSC|3.0|The trailer, cover, and sleeve all hint unashamedly at an adult theme - sexually charged, and almost bordering on fetishism. What we actually have is a tardy allegory of the proclivities of two individuals who get thrown together in very unlikely fashion. The opening five minutes pulls you in and then annoyingly proceeds (like so many movies today) in retrospective fashion, outlining it's tale. A damaged, disturbed young woman finds solace in the employ of a compulsive and manipulative (if reluctant) lawyer and embarks on a series of ever more daring, and often bizarre role playing encounters. I would love to give more praise for actually outstanding performances, but the script is weak, and does not explore fully enough the story behind the story. A very good idea, handled very badly. Give it a miss.
B00005JLEX|5.0|It is about time that Seinfeld is being made into a DVD.  I can not wait for the release date to come out.  Seinfeld is one of my favorite shows of all time.  I have seen every episode and absolutly love this show.  I can't wait for this to come out on DVD.  Then you also get to see the bonus footage, deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.  It is going to be great.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I've been a die-hard fan of Madonna's since the very beginning. So it hurts me to say that this album, \\"American Life\\", is the worst of her career.<BR>The album starts out with the title track,\\"American Life\\", where the lyrics sound like something her daughter wrote. The rap is embarrassing. Madonna should have left rapping behind with 'Vogue'. <BR>The only song where I feel sincerity is \\" Love Profusion\\" where I am sure she is singing to her husband, Guy Ritchie. Very sweet. <BR>The rest of the album is self centered and preachy. I also found the electronical bleeps and burps annoying. <BR>The problem with this album is that Madonna is trying to tell us that she has (after twenty years of being a superstar) had it all wrong. She's tried to recreate herself over and over, yet she hadn't found true happiness until now. She complains about the media,the excess, etc, all of which she created herself. I found that extremely phony. She is living quite well off of an image she has created with the help of the very medium she is now trashing. <BR>All in all, I think Madonna needs to get rid of the electronica, take some songwriting lessons and get off of her high horse. <BR>Save your money. This is coming from a Madonna Fan.
B00005JL7Q|1.0|I cannot really remember when I watched that movie and that's actually good. I even don't remember anything that happened in it, because i left the room after about 10 minutes to have a wait outside. That was much more fun. :-)<BR>But it always seemed to be a great movie --- I once heard something like that...<BR>Okay,... so... well... the first 10 minutes were nearly amazing, charming and so on.<br />And now, the end is near 'coz there is nothing more to say !<br />To take it serious, I must say, that this movie is very common. It deals with every-day life and its problems. There was nothing new to experience in it.  <BR>The main characters are very well interpreted by their actors, but they also cannot make it an above-average movie.
B000089CJI|3.0|Listening to Postal Service's &quot;Give Up&quot; is a bit like swimming in a pool in which the depth is constantly shifting from shallow to abyssal. At times songs like &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; and &quot;Nothing Better&quot; make the album feel sonorous, original and satisfying, but the electronic beeps and blips, as well as the purposely abstract lyrics, fade away as a gimmick on many of the other songs. As a result, the album is interesting to listen to, but generally shallow. A few of the songs are catchy or worthwhile, but overall the album has little replayability over time. Like the beeps and blips, the album itself is, in the end, a gimmick.
0425156842|4.0|Jostein Gaarder, intending his novel of the history of philosophy to be unorthodox and out of the ordinary, blended application of philosophical theorem to real life and delightfully fanciful plot twists and occurrences that make the story a flight into the imagination of the philospher, or as the case may be, into the imagination of the author.<br />Sophie is a girl who has a seemingly normal life until things that are not to say the least paranormal begin to happen to her. Suddenly she is tossed into a maelstrom of fantasy in which she rides on gooseback, watches ancient Greek ruins renew themselves from the dust, shrinks to the size of a thumb, talks to dogs, and meets some interesting people. These include Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse, Noah, and Ebenezer Scrooge, to name a few.<br />But what strikes me as the most surprising are not the fantastic surprises within the book, but the practical surprises of everyday life. More than talking animals and escapes from reality, what bugs me is how<br />-Sophie doesn't get freaked out during a correspondence with a mysterious philosopher and call the whole thing off<BR>-Her mother lets her walk off into the woods to meet a middle-aged man without punishing her or showing more than minimal signs of suspicion<BR>-Sophie can sit through lessons with Alberto without getting bored at his long philosophical lectures. (not that they are not well-written, but that's if you're reading them, not listening to them)<BR>-Alberto has memorized entire novels on philosophy and philosophical theorem<BR>-Joanna's parents and Sophie's mother don't freak out during Joanna's and Jeremy's ... er... encounter at the garden party<br />Gaarder definitely paints a picture of a kind of super-reality in this novel, and remarkably keeps our attention down to the last page, while educating us. The six concluding chapters to the book are especially superbly written, and I can only imagine that this novel in its original Norwegian is all the more beautiful.
B00005JLYU|4.0|I went to see this movie on opening weekend and expected to be packed in with hundreds of other people.  When I walked in (during previews) the theater was less than half full.  Anyway, about the movie.  I must say that the movie was funny.  With all of the inside jokes and endless physical humor going on, what else would it be.  I must say that casting Demi Moore as the Angel gone bad was a bit of a stretch. I do disagree with one reviewer of this film, who stated that replacing the Bosley character was a mistake.  If the Charlie's Angels films stayed with the same format as the television series then the Angels would carry guns, instead of using their intelligence to reason through a situation.  In this way, I applaud what Drew Barrymore has tried to do in remaking the \\"Angels\\".  There are a lot of movies out there which use guns endlessly.  I prefer to go to a movie that allows you to watch a hero or heroine reason their way out of a situation, instead of falling back on bang, bang, shoot 'em dead.  I am very glad that they brought back Jacqueline Smith in a cameo.  This is a great way of continuing the tradition and passing on the wisdom of one Angel to another.  I guess you could say that aside from a few points in the movie that didn't quite make sense (i.e. The Thin Man turning good and no explanation why) I enjoyed this movie a great deal and will purchase it when it comes out on videotape.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code really made me think.  I couldn't put the book down.  I'm an art teacher and I found myself looking up historical concepts on the computer as well as pulling out my art history books.  This book was really exciting because it had a great secret that had to be solved.  I was compelled to try and figure out the code.  I kept thinking about what was going to happen next.  There were many twists and turns and I can't wait to read another book by Dan Brown.  He is clever, entertaining and thought provoking with a dash of mischievousness.  This was a great way to start my summer vacation.  I'm telling all my friends about it because I want to talk with them after they read it!  If you like mystery, history, conspiracy and puzzles you will love this book and appreciate the author's unique style of writing.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is a fantastic R&amp;B/hip hop/ dance artist! This album is fantastic and features a wide range of artists from rap star Jay Z to Reggae star Sean Paul, from hip hop star Missy Elliot to classic R&amp;B stars. Her songs would attract a wide range of fans. For instance, &quot;Baby Boy&quot; sounds like 50 cent's &quot;In Da Club&quot; and &quot;Hip Hop star&quot; sounds like Outkast's &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot;. In between her songs she has interludes and themes just like TLC's all-time great &quot;Crazysexycool&quot; LP. Her album is true to the Destiny's child type of music (like the naughty girl song-it's like Jumpin Jumpin) and at the same time it's a totally different kind of masterpiece. One of the album's highlights is the album's first track, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;-a great, fun, catchy single with a great video and it really starts to grow on you. All the other songs are great too-in their own way.<br />In short I highly recommend this album to all Beyonce fans, Destiny's child fans, TLC fans, etc. It's a new side of Beyonce-it's a new side of R&amp;B that mixes dance and pop with hip hop and vocal tracks.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Nice job.<br />Only Norah's earlier unreleased work sounds better.
B000008LOV|5.0|This album brings back many memories of my early childhood, one that simply cannot be beat.  A versatile group of honorable musicians in Petty, Orbison, Dylan, Harrison, and produced by Lynn all added their signature touches to each track ranging from upbeat tracks to heartbreakers.  I wore the tape out when I was 3 when it came out, and there was a good reason for that!  A great album by great musicians.

B000092ZYX|1.0|Radiohead used to be one of my favorite bands. Pablo Honey is my absolute favorite release of theirs. The last few releases, however, have been poor showcases of their vocal and musical talents. They have really gone downhill. It's too bad because they are capable of such great stuff. I hated the last few releases and I'm not liking this latest one any better. I wish I had borrowed it from a friend and burned it, or downloaded the MP3 instead of wasting my money on a CD that is going in the trash can.

B00008DDSC|5.0|Believe it or not the word that kept coming to mind as I watched &quot;Secretary&quot; was &quot;cute.&quot;  This might strike you as strange given that it is a movie about sadomasochism, but this was the word my wife kept using during the last half of this 2002 film from director Steven Shainberg.  I checked out &quot;Secretary&quot; because I heard it was &quot;quirky,&quot; which is usually not synonymous with &quot;cute.&quot;  &quot;Secretary&quot; benefits from perfect casting, with James Spader as Mr. Grey, the paralegal, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Miss Holloway, the titular character.  Obviously, when the word &quot;cute&quot; arises it is intended primarily to describe Gyllenhaal, which is important because her character could be written off as a pathetic soul instead of someone who provokes our sympathy (and perhaps our admiration as well).<br />Miss Holloway has just been released from a mental institution; she likes to cut herself and the last time she went a bit too far.  Now her mother (Lesley Ann Warren) locks up all the knives and the young woman goes off into the world to find her first job.  She has excellent typing scores but there is something else that makes Mr. Grey hire her when she goes to her first interview, and several weeks later when she makes an error on a letter we discover what it is: these two were made for each other and soon Miss Holloway is making mistakes on purpose so that Mr. Grey can discipline her.<br />There are three things that make this movie work at this point.  The first is that Mr. Grey orders her to stop cutting herself.  Now her pain is going to be administered primarily in terms of spanking, which is nowhere nearly as dangerous as piercing her flesh with sharp objects.  She is, by objective standards, better off under his control.  The second is that Miss Holloway never expresses fear over what she is being asked to do.  Her complete acceptance, combined with the previous point, aid in our acceptance of the situation.  The third is that underneath it all &quot;Secretary&quot; is a standard love story.  Two people looking for love find each other and struggle to make a complete connection that will allow them to build a life together.  There are other characters in this film, but they are all minor players in the main drama between Mr. Grey and Miss Holloway.<br />Long ago we discovered that in a romance film the &quot;I love you&quot; line is almost never those three particular worlds.  It is &quot;Here's looking at you kid,&quot; &quot;Where are my slippers,&quot; or something equally memorable.  &quot;Secretary&quot; is no different in that regard, although it is obviously a film where actions speak louder than words.  This is the story of two people who have a love that they are able to make work.  That is nothing to laugh at, and, indeed, the film saves its funniest moments for a time when the relationship has been resolved.  This is, despite expectations to the contrary and the utter surprise of a large portion of the audience, a cute film.<br />Final note: Make a point of considering how nudity is used in this film.  I think the point in &quot;Secretary&quot; in which the nudity becomes more that brief is rather surprising and it made me think about why it was at that particular point it was used.  There is significance to this choice that needs to be appreciated.tion.  The third is that underneath it all &quot;Secretary&quot; is a standard love story.

B00005JLYU|1.0|Comedy is hard. If there is any film that proves this over and over it's CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE. A film that operates not unlike a home movie: It looks like a lot of fun to shoot, but not worth the time watch for anyone not involved. To its audience it offers a few laughs, some neat action sequences, sexy girls and not much more.<br />`Now wait a minute' you say, `that exactly what a movie like Charlie's Angels is all about.' `You're absolutely correct!' I retort, `But maybe I want more out of my bad movies.'<br />CA:FT has a paper-thin plot. There are these rings and they store a lot of information on them about the witness protection program. Somebody stole them and it's up to Angels, Natalie (Cameron Diaz, The Sweetest Thing), Dylan (Drew Barrymore, Never Been Kissed), and Alex (Lucy Liu, Kill Bill), to find out who.<br />The plot is all set-up for some really neat if over-rated action sequences, that for the most part hold your attention. In fact there is this really cool dirt bike scene. Every action scene is shot with confidence. Director McG (Charlie's Angels) has a really keen eye for what looks good. He could direct those skateboard DVDs that you find all over Best Buy. It's just too bad he can't tell a coherent story.<br />Every scene in CA:FT feels like a short film. A music video if you will, and while McG is okay with action; any attempt at comedy falls like a lead balloon. One or two jokes work only because Bernie Mac (Life) is generally very funny. But without a decent director the Angels themselves just fall flat. Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu are enchanting, apart in other films. Even together they have nice chemistry, but without a director who has firmly marked out each comedic beat, every funny moment between the angels is destroyed.<br />I did like Crispin Glover's small role in the film. He's always been a favorite character actor of mine. You can't help but look at him and feel sorry for him. I wished we had seen more of him, and less some of the other weird cameos and bit parts that clutter this film. Let me just tell you Pink has no career in acting; she may have a great music career ahead of her. But the Camera hates you. Give Up!<br />As for Demi Moore (Passion of Mind) her role is too small and inconsequential to be worth discussing except to say. Wow women you still look pretty fine. I hope she makes another more substantial film cause watching her on screen, I realized how much I missed her. Hey maybe she could star in a romantic comedy with Stallone, revive two careers at once. Hmm.....I've got box office gold.<br />I didn't walk into CA:FT with any high expectations. It's a bad movie, but it's not bad enough to hate. It's not campy, funny, or even silly enough to recommend as a rental for some laughs either.

B0000025T6|4.0|I am a looooooong-time Bruce fan, and like another reviewer said, it took me a while to even remotely like this album. All due to my \\"shallow\\" expectations, I suppose. Years later, I realize how powerful the lyrics are on this album. Especially the song Reason to Believe. What an amazing snapshot of the human (not american but human) experience. Everyday someone is getting left, defrauded, beaten, or in the vernacular \\"dissed\\". The writer sits and marvels at how with all the \\"lies, BS and pain\\" people dish out to each other - the victims merely get up brush themselves off and go on as if nothing happened. Is it due to resiliancy or mass self-dillusion? He leaves it up to you to decide. Now that's some serious writing! It made me realize why I\\"ll always be a fan.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I went to see this movie and into it for the first 20 min or so then i kept seeing somthing at the top of the screen that had we wondering. and then again i saw it. it was the michophone boom droping into the shot. now i was a little suprised to see that . i thought it would only be in those two scenes but again  it kept comminh back. in the coutroom  it looksed like richard wwas about to get hit on the head with it. and it was not hidden at all. the shots should have been reshot. i find it funny that not mony other proplr want to admit that it was in the shots.  just watch the dvd when it comes out you will agree it shoul not be getting all the press it has been getting. it was like watching a high school  film class movie with big names.
0553278398|5.0|This story to answer my nagging questions as to how Hari Seldon came to be is a welcome addition to my favorite science-fiction trilogy.<br /><br />I would love to see the series put on the big screen. If so, I hope the director will refrain from too great a dependence on special effects or big name movie stars. The key to this series is the story and character development.<br />Give this book and the next three in the series your attention. Stop reading the series there, for that is how it should have ended.<br /><br />But do go on to read other Asimov works - I especially recommend his Guide to Earth and Space! Then find his history of Europe and read it. Then, mail it to me as the last person I lent it to failed to return it to me before he left Egypt! Yikes...careful who you loan your Asimov books to!
B00005JM09|5.0|I went to an advance screening last night. My expectations were pretty low, given the lack of James Cameron at the helm and the span of years that have passed since T2. My biggest concern going in was that it would just be a Terminator vs. Terminator rehash with no real contribution to the story arc of Cameron's universe. My fears were unfounded, however. Jonathan Mostow has done an admirable job of capturing the audacious action and dark humor of the first two movies, while still managing to provide enough new twists to keep this third incarnation fresh. Yes, there's a lot of T-101 vs. T-X insanity, but these sequences are so well-executed and so over the top you can't help but laugh with glee. Kristanna Loken is every bit as scary as Robert Patrick was in the second installment, to the point where during one scene the girl next to me actually screamed in terror. The script, while a bit light on character development, offers plenty of great moments, both frightening and humorous. There are also many smart and unexpected references to the earlier films to tie everything together. Best of all, without giving anything away, important things happen. Things you'll want to see and know about if you are a fan of the first two films. My only gripe is that certain elements of the plot (which I can't reveal) aren't adequately explained. Perhaps those explanations wound up on the cutting room floor and we'll get them on the DVD. However, by the time that classic Terminator theme faded in and the credits rolled, I was very happy with the experience and my doubts about this third chapter in the series were put to rest. This film is about more than cashing in on a successful franchise. They've tried to do justice to the series' legacy and, in my opinion, they've succeeded.
B000002IST|5.0|This was the final album of Genesis with Phil Collins and it was one of the best and I'm finding out that with time it just seems to get even better. A great selection of songs from fast to slow and everything in between. I really wish they would have kept it together for a few more albums.
B00008DDXC|4.0|The Harry Potter books are at an all-time popularity status, as illustrated by the intense, gigantic crowds...But, without the video games, merchandise, and these movies, that would be a signifigant less number of people.<br />These movies are enertaining, but they lack a certain something that is vital to book-to-movie films - difference. A good book adaption should be different than the book. Perhaps look at it from a different way, express it in a different light. Steve Kloves, the screenwriter, has, as far as I can tell, merely put the book into screenplay format and takes a lot of credit for it. _I_ could do that.<br />However, enertainment of this calibre (look at the books, after all, and how clever and fun they are) will invariably win you over. For Chamber of Secrets, the cast is top notch. Some names that came out on top for me, here, was Kenneth Branaugh as the pompous and egotistical Gilderoy Lockhart; Alan Rickman as the enigmatic and ill-tempered Severus Snape; Christian Coulson as the energetic and ambitious Tom Riddle; Jason Isaacs as the cruel and scene-chewing Lucius Malfoy; Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, a character who I was distressed to see sink to the level of mere comic relief; and, of course, Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.<br />The special effects have improved this time around. Though Aragog, like the troll in the first film, looks terribly fake. The Basilisk appears more as a dragon-snake than the King of Serpents, but it works, and is a very winning villain. Of course, I'm biased, as I love snakes, but...<br />All in all - this is a charming little addition to any DVD collection.<br />--Crow Skyler...
B00004U8P9|5.0|i have to admit that the first time i was offerred to see this movie i balked at it and said it was groos and dumb.  boy was i wrong.  the movie is hilarious and one of my favorite movies of all time.  i love the music and i am a new obsessive about musicals and this ranks up there with any musical out there.  reason being that the songs are so unique and quirky that you cannot help but like them.  when i heard that there was an anniversary edition coming out i was there the first day to buy it.  the discs are loaded with extras and they are all really cool.  the characters are unforgettable and tim curry give his best performance ever in this movie.  he has the character nailed down to an art and his performance of sweet transvestite is worth watching over and over again.  anyone who does not like this movie needs to get a sense of humor because this movie makes things funny in ways never imagined.  this whole movie is dedicated to the extreme and that is what makes it special.  when a movie goes to the limits of imagination the movie takes on a whole new meaning.  this movie is a total experience and needs to be seen at least once and if you ever have the chance go to a midnight showing with audience interaction it only makes the movie that much more special.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I've listened many times, and it's still good.  Okay, Dawn is irritating, but isn't that the point of her character?  I had enjoyed Tony Head singing on the show, so of course I like his song and his duet with Amber Benson (Tara).  Amber and James Marsters are really good as well.  That group makes up four must listen to songs.  <br />Buffy has a decent voice, certainly without the subtleties and training one finds in ASH's voice, or Amber's.  Nevertheless, there is a vulnerability and hesitation in her voice that is appropriate given the context of the songs.  She hits and misses, but generally she is pretty much on.
B000001EUL|4.0|It isn't as hard rocking as all the other Scorpions album, but it is still a great album. The best songs in there would be &quot;Loving you Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, and &quot;Always Somewhere.&quot; Those songs wouldn't be the most hard rocking songs of the Scorpions, but they are one of the best soft rock classics of the Scorpions besides the song &quot;Still Loving You&quot; from the album Love at First Sting. I recommend this album if you are big fan of the Scorpion's songs, hard of soft.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie and all of them were absolutly amazing. Funny, action, sadness, happiness. Great for whole family. Great graphics, everything looks so real. The makers were smart to do it all at once.
0790740443|3.0|...<br />Anyway, I would call this movie mediocre. Okay plot, but nothing to expansive. The acting is okay, but over emotional and predictable. The plotline in particular is very predictable. From the moment Kurt Russell falls off the rope wall fight event, with his opponent, whom he scars, you know that you will see his scarred opponent again elsewhere in the movie. The movie's main villain, a westpoint snob, is like a Snidley Whiplash ripoff, with a weapon wielding Dudley Do-right ... <br />The action is decent, but the usual predictable implications of honor, and veiled morals are evident.<br />In short nothing special. Seen a million others just like it.

B00009V7T2|5.0|I'd have to say this is one of the most amazing albums I've ever heard, by far, very far. In this world of pseudo-punk hell, it is SUCH a relief to have the beautiful music that is The Mars Volta. The pure genius of it will bring tears to your eyes and such a great appreciation for what these guys have done for the world of music. It is simply captivating, I'm absolutely in awe.
B000001EUP|4.0|It is a more hard rocking album of the Scorpions. It has more of a hevy metal sound than in the Scorpions other album Animal Magnetism and Lovedrive. It even has the song &quot;When the Smoke is going down&quot; in it. It has an eerie sound in it, it's not too soft of a song nor too hard. That song would be an authentic Scorpions classic. Dynamite, Now and Blackout shows the heavy metal side of the Scorpions. The song &quot;You give me all I need&quot; shows more of the band's emotional side. I recommend this album if you are a hard rocking Scorpions fan.
0792844882|2.0|It's worth watching if you're a grown-up with a perverse sense of humor.  And have a fridge full of beer.<br />Where to start?  This movie is an abortion all the way through.  Elizabeth Berkeley pretty much ruined her career by starring in this junk.  Even accomplished actors like Robert Davi and Kyle McLachlan are still living it down.  The only person who seemed to be enjoying herself is Gina Gershon; one suspects that she realized how trashy this was, and decided to have fun and give a campy performance as a wink to the audience.<br />One problem some viewers might have is the script's rampant misogyny.  Women are shown as either innocent victims or drug-addled, backstabbing, borderline homicidal whores.  Supposedly Paul Verhoeven will have nothing to do with Joe Ester-whatever anymore because of this movie's misogyny.<br />Of course, when a movie is as badly written as this is, the misogyny is less offensive and more a sign of the limited psyche of those involved, and something to laugh at.<br />The rampant nudity becomes numbing after a while, and even though there's also a generous amount of male flesh on view, in typical Hollywood sexism, you never get full frontal male nudity in this.  Boo.<br />I'd give this one star for being so bad, but at the same time it's so amusingly trashy and unintentionally campy that I find it fun for a few drunken laughs.  I just saw it this past weekend, at a midnight show in a Washington, DC theater.  They provided a keg of beer and we were encouraged to yell at the screen.  It was a blast giving this movie the derision it deserves.
B000021XS0|5.0|This truely is Dream Theater's masterpiece and one of the best Prog Rock albums of all time (even if it does have some embarrasing lyrics and cheesy radio-play style narration and sound effects).
B00005JLWN|4.0|Equilibrium is a movie that is unexpected from all directions. To the Brillian Action Sequences, Performances and Art Direction.<br />The story is set in the near future where people are left to live in the world with no feelings whatsoever, by injecting a new found formula called Prozium. The government belives that feeling such as anger, rage, jealousy etc. are the main causes of people's intolerance to Humanity.<br />Christian Bale is outstanding in this movie. He is very still and rigid which is great, because that's what his character is all about. His best emotions show through when he is at a time in the movie where his feelings and his passion for wanting to live life with feelings are emerging from inside of him. The supporting cast of Taye Diggs and Emily Watson is also great, they both add a feeling of completeness to the whole movie which was great to see.<br />Props goes to the director Kurt Wimmer who wrote and directed the movie with such passion that he also made up a new technique of fighting called 'Gun-Kata'. This method of fighting with guns is brilliant. The action sequences are choreographed prestinely and right on the money. The art of 'Gun-Kata' is all over the place, which isn't bad, because the Photography of the film is shot in a pace that makes you see the Beauty in the Danger. Well Done.<br />The Art Direction of the sets are great. I see lots of symettry and lot's of dark colours of Grey. Lot's of Dark Grey which is great because it hightens the sense of flatness in the charaters' emotionless lives.<br />Equilibrium is something that I've been wanting to see for a while. It left the theatres quickly, but for sure this movie is something worth watching.
0767817478|2.0|Well, I admit I was interested in this movie when it came out.  I actually saw it in the IMAX--what a waste of money!  First, the two main characters seem like mindless airheads.  I expected more from Matthew Broderick.  Still, it is GODZILLA after all and part of the old school Godzilla was the whole campiness of it all.  I was disappointed more than anything else...
B000002MP2|4.0|Green Day, one of the greatest bands around and Dookie, by far their best album ever, which is saying a lot.  Green Day is a cross between light fluffy bubble-gummy rock and hard forceful rock, with very clever lyrics and a great drummer.  Here is a review of all the songs on this CD.<br />1. Burnout -  (8/10) This is a good song, but it's nothing special.  Good guitar and I like the drums.<br />2. Having A Blast - (7.5/10) This is also a good song, it's more angry than most of their songs, and there is no real catchy chorus or great guitar part, so it's only okay.<br />3. Chump - (8/10) The guitar is catchy and stands out right away.  It's a pleasant song but I really don't like the instrumental part at the end.  They need a better way to end the song.<br />4. Longview - (8.5/10) This song really was speaking the truth about boring life.  Great song but not super.  It's a song that really spells Green Day once you hear it.  It defines them as a band.<br />5. Welcome to Paradise - (8.8/10) This one is better than Longview, but doesn't deserve a 9.  It has a catchy chorus and guitar part the tune is kind of annoying and so is the whole song.<br />6. Pulling Teeth - (9/10) This is my second favorite song on the whole album.  Great guitar, vocal, bass, and drums.  Pretty much the whole song is great, but it could be longer.  Also very pleasant to listen to.<br />7. Basket Case - (8.9/10) I love this song.  The first time I got the CD and heard this song I played maybe 12 times in a row and I would have listened longer but I had to be somewhere.  Very catchy and very true.<br />8. She - (9.5/10) This song is so awesome.  The best on the CD and the best Green Day has ever written.  Great vocals guitar and bass.  I don't know why but I just love this song.<br />9. Sassafras Roots - (8/10) I hope I spelled that right.  Anyway, this song has good vocals, but there's just a little something that sounds strange. It's still a good song but could be better.<br />10. When I ComeAround - (8.8/10) It seems they stuck all their great songs in the back.  This song is so great once I heard it I was singing it my head everywhere for 2 weeks.  It was so good I didn't even want it to get unstuck from my mind.<br />11. Coming Clean - (6/10) I'm not really a big fan of this song.  It's not 'bad', but I wouldn't go so far as to say 'good.'  But compared to the great songs on this CD, I guess I had to give it this rating.<br />12. Eminus Sleepus - (7.5/10) Good guitar and lyrics, but lacks meaning and could be longer.  It's a good song, one of my favorits, but there are definitly better on the CD.<br />13. In The End - (7/10) So now I know where Linkin Park got it from.  It starts strong right away but the tune of the lyrics kinda ...  But it's definitly not bad.<br />14. F.O.D. - (8/10) It deserves better but since everything on here is so good, I gave it this.  It's good guitar and I just like it.  Although the first time I heard it, I hated it, but it definitly grew on me.<br />And that's my review on what I think as one of the 15 Greatest Albums of all time.  And when you listen to Green Day, it makes your day a little greener.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I honestly don't know how to describe Donnie Darko.  After I got finished watching it I wasn't quite sure what it was that I just saw.  This movie defies classification. It is set in the late 80's during the Bush-Dukakis presidential race.  This fact is not so important other than it gives the movie a concrete sense of time.  This is the when.<br />The film follows teenaged Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Donnie is in therapy for his schizophrenia and the movie switches between what we see as the reality of the movie and his visions of some creature that looks like it has a mask of a disturbing rabbit.  This rabbit is man sized and it instructs Donnie to act and to do things.  Exactly what these things are would spoil some of the wonder of the movie.  In the reality, the film opens with the engine from a plane falling from the sky and crashing through Donnie's bedroom.<br />Donnie's family is fairly normal.  He argues with his sister (played by Jake's real life sister Maggie).  His parents try their best to provide for the family and to help Donnie with his therapy.  He is somewhat of an outcast at school but has his group of friends.  He meets a new girl at school (Jena Malone) and they begin a relationship that feels real despite the strangeness of their meeting.<br />The strength of this movie comes from Donnie's belief in his visions.  It provides motivation as well as tension throughout the movie.  As an added bonus this movie is so original that we don't quite know where the movie is going.  There is discussion of time travel and hints of what might really be going on.<br />As a whole, this is a fascinating movie.  It requires multiple viewings and since I have only seen it once, I'm not entirely sure of everything that happened in the movie.  It is a  little confusing, but definitely worth watching.
B00008G9JM|5.0|This is the best progressive rock album ever released!<BR>Absolutely flawless.
6305508550|5.0|this movie is great. I love it, my friends love it, its a cult classic. About the only people who dont like it are women, im not sure why, however, some women like it, but if you a guy, this is the movie for you.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail To The Thief, Radiohead's 6th full-length album, returns somewhat to their traditional rock roots.  But if you're expecting a full return to The Bends, or even OK Computer, think again.  This album sees the band culling out the largest strengths of both their rock era and their more recent experimental ouvre to create a creative, diverse, yet natural-sounding album.  The album opens up with the rocker '2+2=5', and the first political potshot is aimed not at our world leaders, but at the public's fickle ears; Thom Yorke works the soft-loud dynamic to perfection, repeatedly drilling into our heads, \\"you are not even paying attention.\\"  And although the album sees many more rock elements than Amnesiac and Kid A, this is just as moody and dark as any post-Bends CD.  'Sit Down, Stand Up' uses a minimalist piano line to create a chilling tune, whereas the plodding, creepy 'We Suck Young Blood' puts a gothic spin to their political agenda.  Near the end of the song, the slow dirge is replaced with disorganized noise for a few bars until returning back to its Castlevanian roots.  The overall effect is breathtakingly haunting.  The closing track 'A Wolf At The Door' revisits OK Computer's themes of paranoia, while borrowing Bob Dylan's insistent vocal flow to create one of Radiohead's finest moments.  Other standouts include the tradmark downbeat ballad 'Sail To The Moon', the first single 'There There', and the syncopated 'Myxomatosis', which is the best song about diseased rabbits that I know.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of tunes that don't really appeal to me.  One is 'Backdrifts', whose crisp, ambient backdrop and inspired lyrics are dulled by an ill-fitting vocal melody.  Another is the ultimately forgettable 'Scatterbrain'.  Otherwise, it's business as usual for Radiohead, another quality album that should appeal to all fans.  I personally would have loved to hear more of the jazz influences included in Kid-A, but Radiohead's mission has always been to offer something different with each subsequent album, without compromising musical merit.  I believe they have succeeded again.
B00000099Y|5.0|to everyone who has posted and said that this band is non musical, and one person who even said that it had sloppy drumming, are you freakin retarted? i mean have you ever in your life tried to count music? if so try counting tool songs, there are some that are almost uncountable. as for the album itself i like this the most out of all tool's work, it's quite talented with the hard edge that i like.
0064471837|5.0|This book was so great. It had every element you'd want to find in a story. tragedy, comedy, romance, adventure, magic and sarcasim. Sabriel finds out that her father has been trapped in the world of the dead and sets out to find him meeting a \\"cat\\" with an adittude, a boy her age who just happens to be a prince with a very interesting story and past, and several handfulls of dead things. read the book, it's good, trust me.
6303913903|4.0|Showgirls is a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it because it gives you a much better idea of what life would be like as a showgirl. I first saw it on VH1 and it grew on me. A good movie overall. Could've been better, probably. But of course, it could've been worse. <br />The whole boss affair was a bit shocking and so was the part with James. And was I the only one that noticed that James's lead dancer in that private dance was one of the girls who worked at the Cheetah?
0783225857|5.0|I rented this movie after the passing of Gregory Peck (whose daughter named her child Harper) and I'm sooo glad that I did. I had no idea that one of my favorite directors Robert Mulligan (Summer of '42, Man in the moon) directed it . He seems to be one of the only directors whose films never fail to make me cry. The opening credits were absolutley touching with the child humming and the rest of the film did not dissapoint either. Mary Badham reeks with realness in her role of Scout. Mulligan went out of his way to hire child actors from the South . He wanted children who knew the context of the film and had real Southern accents. Thank you Robert, Southerner's notice the accent and appreciate this. However, I did miss Aunt Alexandra and the storyline behind Mrs. Dubois but then again movies never quite meet the standards set by books.
B00007GZR0|4.0|Feeling in the mood for an over-the-top 60s classic?  Check out Doris Day, Rock Hudson, and Tony Randall in Send Me No Flowers.  <br />Hudson plays George Kimball, a hypochondriac who, on one of his regular visits to the doctor, overhears a conversation that makes him think that he's about to die.  He tells his friend and neighbor, Arnold (Randall), his secret, and the two of them begin to plan George's funeral.  George decides to shelter his wife, Judy (Day), from the horrible truth, but he also realizes that she won't be able to manage life on her own.  So George takes matters into his own hands and begins searching for her second husband.  Meanwhile, Judy becomes suspicious of George's actions and starts to suspect him of having an affair. <br />This movie was filmed in true 60s style.  It's bright and colorful -- and silly.  It's full of over-exaggerated slapstick comedy.  And it's got all kinds of eccentric characters -- like the gossipy milkman, the swinging bachelor, and the over-enthusiastic cemetery plot salesman.  It's a simple movie, but the simplicity makes it just that much funnier.
B000003TBP|5.0|Whoa, what a disc. This cd is just great all around. Every track is very, very unique, and several are remarkable. The hits (New Pollution, Devil's Haircut, Where It's At) are all good, but the real treasures are some of the lesser known songs on here. Hotwax is a weird, funk-inflected groove that will really catch your attention. Minus is a quick rocker that is also eye-widening, and Ramshackle is a long, bizarre ballad that is equally interesting. Beck's ingenuity was displayed on a minor scale before Odelay, and after this critically acclaimed award-winner, he's been a household name. Beck's fame is condign, and he is a good example of an artist that hasn't sold out. He sticks to what he does best. And that is writing outlandish songs that coalesce all genres into one fun, blurring album. Odelay could be an album for a party, for reading, for crying, for screaming, for laughing, you name it. It's so flexible and at the same time rigid enough to evoke passion and meaning each time you listen to it. I could go on and on about Beck and his masterful song-writing, but if you kept reading, it would detract from the most valuable time that would be better spent listening to the album. So do yourself a favor and pick this up if you don't have it. It will be a treat and a half.
0871137380|5.0|Read this book for the riveting story or for the lessons it presents: in either case it will be delicious.  The story moves fast and furious and reveals important lessons that are powerful and engaging.  It is significant that Black Hawk Down has gained acceptance by the US Army Command and General Staff College as a graduate level resource.  Mr. Bowden's description of the Mogadishu battle, his treatment of the paticipants, and his general conclusions are thorough, balanced and surprisingly discerning.  Too bad all journalists aren't as objective.  He reveals some of the new complexities of modern urban warfare.  Newly developed sensors, weapons, and elite forces and tactics are now part of the American arsenal. Their employment in densely populated cities is a challenging frontier of both military art and science.  Engagements in Mogadishu revealed a number of tactical, operational, and cultural challenges confronting American commanders and troops in the urban battlespace. The Somali side of the conflict is also explored, with detailed accounts of Somali participants, their adaptive tactics and their motivations.  Mr. Bowden's journalistic objectivity cannot, however, fully conceal his contempt for Clinton/Albright geopolitical incompetence -- a perspective which remains a powerful undercurrent in the American military.
B00005JJXU|2.0|I agree with the viewer from Florida. Hepburn just isn't Holly Go Lightly. This film is 60's fluff and does not do Truman Capote's novel justice at all. If you want to read a true masterpiece get the book!
B00005YTFG|5.0|I loved this movie! I have watched it at least a dozen times, and I am still not tired of it!  Note: this movie is definitely a chick flick! I don't know a single guy who actually enjoys this movie thoroughly as most women who watch it do!  However, I have known a few guys to sit through the movie.  It is a great piece of work by Baz Luhrman (i'm not sure if that is spelled right).
B00005TQ5E|5.0|This album has a very unique sound just like the band.  Full of great songs such as the four singles: &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, and &quot;Running&quot;.  When listening to this album, you won't want to skip any tracks.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I love all the songs in this CD. Keep it up BEP. And great job to Apl for singing a Filipino song on this CD. It's all about Filipino pride baby.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Churchhill said,\\"We will fight them on the beaches, in the air, and on the land.\\" After this incident, it's like we were saying we'll fight them, but if they kill some of us we'll go home. Political views aside this film was the closest anyone has come to depicting war from the modern and, more importantly, from the soldiers perspective. For Jerry Bruckheimer, this film more than makes up for Pearl Harbor!<br />The performances in this film are what they should have been, nothing more. What I mean by that is that they are not as operatic as they are in some war films. Eric Bana and Josh Hartnett carry the film perfectly, William Fichtner's growing admiration for Ewan McGregor was well played, and Sam Shepard's face shows everything about his growing pain, regret, and disgust at what's happening during the mission. The other parts are as well done as I hoped they would be.<br />This set is why DVD's were created in the first place. Excellent documentaries covering every aspect of the film. Even two historical documentaries that cover the real story as well. The Pentagon's support of this film was REALLY without prescedent. Those were REAL Blackhawks in the insertion scene as well as real rangers!<br />An excellent buy, well worth whatever price you pay!
0385504209|5.0|I try to read as many books as I can, and honestly, I have found few books written in the past decade that I can truly call \\"page turners\\" - books you just can't put down.  I had heard about this book through some friends who praised it profusely.  I bought a copy and haven't been able to put it down.  I read the first 150 pages or so without stopping.  This book is a masterpiece of suspense and intrigue.  Mr. Brown has shot to the top of my list of outstanding authors, and if he writes another book like this one, you can bet I'll be the first in line to buy it.  A VERY important novel, destined to be a classic.
B00004T6V4|4.0|I saw the movie on a local cable channel and I couldn't get the songs out of my head. The next day I went all over the mall looking for the CD and just when I was about to lose hope, I found it! Worth my trouble. Love the smooth electric guitars and haunting vocals ( the flame still burns, what might have been). This CD is still in rotation in my CD changer. ;-)
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown seems to have a way of writing a clif-hanger into every chapter of this book.  It has been a long time since a book so intellectually challenged me...what a great change of pace.<br />You must be strong in your faith to read this and appreciate the different points of view...but anyone who needs to be challenged and stimulated will find the DaVinci Code a very refreshing and exciting journey through art, religion, history, secret societies, religion, cryptogrophy, religion...<br />Seriously though, The DaVinci Code takes you on a wild ride...you will learn about art, people, and maybe even something of yourself.  Enjoy the ride!
B00006JKON|5.0|This album is pretty good, and is actually some people's favorite tull album. I am reviewing it and giving it five stars because some jerk reviewed it half a dozen times, giving it one star each time, and tried to make it appear that each review was from a different poster, though the writing style and phrasology are the same in each review.<br />Suffice to say that if you like jethro tull, you will like this album.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Reviewers who state that they have not heard the sacd version, and on a system that is capable of fairly reproducing music, yet offer a review anyway are irresponsible, no different than if they had commented on widescreen cinematography as mediated by a 13 inch tv, or even reviewing a book by its blurb.  The fact is that on a good sacd system, this disk sounds better than it has ever sounded. Period.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Last Flight of the Osiris is well enough written, and fairly well CGed. A Detective Story is probably the best drawn and written piece, brought to you by the team behind Cowboy Bebop. <br />Second Renisance is not as well drawn in my opinion, but the story is the point of that tale. Powerful and disturbing, it starts to explain the past of the Matrix. It packs in more thought provoking material than the two movies do in a tenth the time. <br />Other peices, such as Beyond or Program, suffer from mediocre art and writing, that while acceptable, is simply forgetable. The same goes for Kid's Story. <br />World Record is just bad, with a lousy story and horid art. Skip it, you will be thankful for saving the 15 minutes. The last peice, Matriculated, has too many \\"huh\\" things in it to be enjoyable, IF you can get past the art. Matriculated is produced by the team who inflicted Aeon Flux and Reign on the anime community, and they are getting better. But it still is too much about people with funny body angles, battling the forces of evil in armoured skivvies. Too weird, too dull, and too out of continuity with the rest of the story line. <br />In short, a third of it is good, very good, even if it is hard to watch. Another third is watchable. And trust me, don't even watch Matriculated or World Record- your mind will be happier with you.
B0000942LT|5.0|This album has been in my cd non stop since it came out .This album will rock you  and the lyrics will take you to the next leval. The song  Yesterday is by far Stainds best. The drumming is awsome and Aaron Lewis is pouring his heart out to a wall of loud kick buttocks guitars.The song Layne is about the late great Layne Staley who is also one of my idols brought tears to my eyes as it blared from my system the first time i herd it. This album isnt for someone who isnt looking for good lyrics or music you can all buy Stinkin Farts new album (Linkin Park) and all of those who want emotion depth and kick buttocks music can buy 14 shades of grey you wont be disapointed
B00009V7T2|5.0|In listening to this album, I have concluded that it can be quickly summarized with one song: &quot;Cicatriz Esp&quot;.  I still cannot imagine how anyone could write a song with such melody, aggression, innovation, and creativity, all combined together perfectly.  This 12 minute song alone has changed the ways I will think of music in general forever...and the entire album does the same.  I dont care who you are or what music you like, buy this album, analyze it carefully, and I hope you will discover what I and many others have already discovered.
0739301985|5.0|We listened to this while driving across country at Christmastime and it was hysterically funny. I highly recommend it!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Em rips it on this album. His lyrics are at their best, and his flow is awesome. There are songs to make you laugh like [ironically] \\"Kill you\\" and songs that are for thought \\"The way I am\\". Anyone that take Em's lyrics seriously might just want to think twice about the things they've thought about once in their lifetime. Em's just able to put these in a song. This album is an adult album i stress, and anyone that cops this album should be aware of its content. And those that are faint of heart, or who can't be open minded need leave it on the shelf.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a new one for me. I thought all the great bands died off in the late 90's. Then along comes Evanescence with Fallen, which I would dare say is an album as close to perfection as one can get. (the other album to almost achieve that landmark is Nine Inch Nails' the Fragile).<br />Let's start off with the the most important of all... The vocals. Amy Lee has a voice that can and does rival Bjork's. Her voice can be soothing one minute and piercing the next, and the chemistry between her voice and the hard metal background works so perfectly together, that I would say that they created a new genre, classical metal. <BR>From the opening track to the very end, I must have played the CD at least five times in a row. I listen to this CD at least twice a day. It is an inspiration to me in the work I do. The Opening track, Going Under, starts everything off with a bang. We notice the powerful vocals of the lead singer and the background music that plays with as much fury as Lee sings with passion. Bring Me to Life of course got me into liking the band from the repeated playings on the radio. and from there on, the whole album takes off like rocket. Every song is dramatic, provocative and beautiful. I don't recall ever skipping through any of the songs.<BR> Evanescence is proof that there is good music out there. Their popularity is well earned and what better way to earn it than with a perfect album.
B00008NRI8|2.0|When I first saw this movie, I was looking for a funny, romantic, movie full of laughter and romance. What I got - a few funny lines, and absolutly NO onscreen chemistry between Grant and Bullock. The plot was good, but it kind of dragged on a bit. The ending didn't hit home, and overall, the film wasn't very good. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, don't bet all your money on this one.
B00005QIPH|4.0|There are two different perspectives on Is This It.  Either, firstly, \\"I hate it I hate it I hate it\\", or secondly, \\"Omigod Omigod Omigod\\".  Seriously, has anybody ever seen a \\"just fair\\" or \\"decent\\" critique for the Strokes?  Well, I'm not giving you one, because I happened to enjoy Is This It.  It is a bunch of tight, almost perfectly played tunes cohesively compiled into half-an-hour of fast rock that isn't punk.  The writing is fresh, though not new, and the melodies are hook-laden.  Fab, the drummer with an adjective for a name, provides quick enjoyable beats while the other members follow suit to form a nice rhythm band.  And get this, sometimes they even solo!! RIGHT ON!!  But Is This It, while not really \\"flawed\\" is just a little er... redundant.  The chords are repetetive, the verses are the same, no one song is radically different from the others, and nothing ever extends to a point of true complexity.  I really expect something more on the bands next album or I will be very disappointed.  So, I recommend the strokes not as background music, nor a sintense listening music; rather, humming and tapping your foot music.
0688163173|4.0|Dennis Lehane's latest is a can't-put-it-down fast read.  It digs below the surface even moreso than the author's other books.  You may end up spending more time thinking about the story than reading it.<br />Parts have a surreal or impressionistic (on the ferry taking them to Shutter Island) feel to them. I can't put my finger on it, but, to my mind, this aspect of the book is not as strong as it could've been; I sense (maybe incorrectly) that the author pulled back some. I like what he was going for and wanted more!<br />The last part of the story gets into heavy-duty paranoia, delusion, dangerous drug experimentation on unsuspecting victims, betrayal and all kinds of fun 1950s stuff.<br />Apparently, Mr. Lehane was inspired by Lord Byron's THE PRISONER OF CHILLON, of which a line is quoted.  Motifs and concepts in SHUTTER ISLAND are found in or perhaps mushroomed from Byron's poem:  Where do you draw the line between the imprisoned and the free; how much of freedom and imprisonment is a state of mind; how much do dreams blend into 'reality'; can the dead warn us of danger; is freedom any less important to animals (the rats! the rats!); can you be free to roam an island -- as, say, an orderly or nurse -- and still be imprisoned?<br />If you like to have every detail spelled out and every question clearly answered, this book might not be for you.  If you don't mind an author leaving his readers mysteries to ponder and puzzle over, grab it!<br />After you've read the book, re-read the first section; it'll take on a whole new meaning.  I believe it also gives a clue to the ending (which, by the way, is a total zinger!).
B000002OX7|5.0|I'm not daring enough to give Who's Next anything less than five stars for fear of rabid fans who may kill me, but if I could, this album would only get four-and-a-half from me.  \\"No!!\\"you say, \\"It has Baba' O Riley, Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled again! This kid's a moron!\\" Yes, I am aware that Who's Next showcases a trio of fantastically epic and popular songs.  But unlike the undisputable classics of rock, say for example, Rubber Soul, Who's Next has little \\"superb\\" material beyond the threesome.  There are three other songs I enjoy, but they are each flawed in some respect.  Bargain is the \\"raunchy rocker\\" of the album, though in many cases, very cheesy and overblown as well.  Love Ain't For Keeping is a nice little piece, but it could never be a \\"classic\\" due to it only being a nice LITTLE piece.  I really do like My Wife, in fact, Entwistle has my favorite voice of the Who, but it is slowed by boring chord progressions  (good thing there is a synth on this album).  Then there are the three middle songs, which range from mediocre to stupid.  Song Is Over is far to overthought, and does not compell me an any way.  In fact, the latter could be said as well for Going Mobile and Getting In Tune.  \\"Hey\\" you shout, \\"This kid sounds like he hates this album! And it has Baba' O Reilly, Behind BLue Eyes, and wOn't Get Fooled Again!!\\"  No, I do not hate this album at all.  I love it.  But when you give something enough hype, the product tends to let you down in the end.  Luckily, there are several \\"Bonus Tracks\\" added to the oirignal LP version to spice it up a little.  It really helps.  Water, Baby Don't You Do It, and Naked Eye are very good tracks.  It also boosts the replay value of the CD.  So, while WHos NExt is most certainly not the most consistent album of our time, it features, yes Baba O' Reilly, Behind Blue Eyes, and Won't Get fooled Again, as well as some other diamonds in the the rough to give enough satisfaction for the purchase.
0375414053|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry.  I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Bridget Jones's Diary (movie or book).  Very clever dialogue (especially the emails).  There was a lot for working moms and women in general to relate to.  Kind of like a chick flick in book form.  I couldn't put it down!
0767819462|3.0|Rated P.G,this ultimate chick flick for all ages, is one movie which will definitley make the most cold hearted person reach for the tissue box,if not at the start,then definitley by the end.<BR>   This is also one movie you wouldn't want to drag your boyfriend,(any typical male,etc),to as they will either find it to low on action,or they will fall asleep.But with that aside,this is an excellent movie to watch with your mum,sister,or friends for a fun girls night.<br />set mainly in the city of New York,this is one of the first films to show the pain and jealousy involved when you divorce,and your ex finds someone else,especially when children are involved and expected to treat their father's new girlfriend as if she were their mum,(which happens all the time in real-life).<BR>  The only bad thing I can say about this movie is the complete lack of suspence,and action.There is virtually no action,mostly sad,hurtful scenes with lots of realistic looking tension between the leads.whilst I say there isn't much action and suspence,the suprises and shocks all through this movie,more than make up for it.Great performances all round from both the leads,Susan Sharadon,and Julia Roberts,and excellent directing by Chris Columbus.<BR>    this ultimate tear-jerker of a movie is a must see,and perfect for a rainy day!
B00004WGAI|5.0|I have seen them all, from Joan Fontaine as the far too pretty Jane, to some of the newer made for A&amp;E versions.  Even the George C. Scott one has some value if only for the scenery.<BR>Zelah Clark is Jane Eyre, she starts out as homely as Charlotte describes her, but as she falls in love with Rochester, and he with her, she blossoms, and becomes beautiful...but she always was.   Timothy Dalton is the BEST Rochester, he IS dark and brooding, he is imperious and mysterious, he fits Bronte's Rochester description to a T.   I think that this version makes the underlying story come to light.  Two broken betrayed people find each other, understand each other's pain and make the other beautiful if only to each other.  They are willing to defy the expectations of society, and follow love, a sincere and wholesome, deep love.  He doesnt marry the &quot;beautiful&quot; Blanche Ingram, he marries the deeply beautiful Jane...she does not care about his money as a matter of fact it makes her uncomfortable.<BR>Jane does not follow StJohn Rivers, He is played well as a priggish young Brocklehurst, something about him resonates with Jane as well as repels her, she is striving to do the right thing, and pay a penance for falling in love with a married man.<BR>Dont forget to watch Timothy Dalton beg Jane not to go after the failed wedding...still gives me the shivers...boy did she have will power!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is a beautiful and talented woman. I praise her for showing the world its more to her than a pretty face.I'm so proud of her accomplishments and I wish her and her album much success. Her recognition is well deserved and this album was long awaited!
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I think every reviewers here somehow lost an idea itself.<BR>Looks like people only care about effects and logic of the story.<BR>I think there is a little bit more to it.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Arguably the most talked about movie of its era or any other era.  Put Speielberg on the map 3 years before his buddy George Lucas joined him in the history books with a little flick called Star Wars.<br />All these years later, we still watch this master piece.
1582432678|4.0|A beautifully crafted, well-honed novel using a current topic. Think you've read it before? - well you haven't. This is an amazing novel using the nurture/nature argument for evil. Eve's letters are poignant, painful, honest, and loving. Her look into her family's life is sharp and focused; even when she's questioning. I couldn't put it down and asked a friend to read it so we could talk about it.
B000062XGG|5.0|Hey.  How can anyone give this 1 star?  This movie is so much fun you have to count the smiles whiles its on.  Sometimes the smile is because they just said something stupid, like alien abduction or Rosewell.  Sure this has more amazing coincidences than a James Bond movie.  <br />There is no nudity and I recall only one foul expletive.<br />I thought Jeff Goldbloom was great in this movie and if there was any doubt about Wil Smiths shotting star, this movie ended that.
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you have listened to this album only a couple times and aren't quite sure what to think about, do yourself a favor and listen again. And when you listen, pay attention until you finally \\"get it.\\" Because when you finally \\"get it,\\" like The Bends and OK Computer, you WILL become completely addicted to it.<br />There are only two songs I could take or leave. 12 songs out of 14 tracks is well worth the money. Can't wait to see what comes next now.
6305364648|4.0|Tom arnold is actually funny in this movie, but his foul mouth keeps this to a 4 star movie, and keeps it away from the kids.  And I don't see why the foulness was necessary.  Don't we include nudity and foul language when we have a bad script or bad director?
B00008O0WN|5.0|Very good conclusion to the movies. I have seen them all. The battle scene is excellent, although I still don't understand why they make the Enterprise so weak in all the films! For Drama I guess :-)
B00000ILDF|3.0|This is a movie some did not like.  It was different.  But the tension is there.  Yes, i rounded down, because i didn't like that that Newt and the Lt were killed after we thought they had been saved.  Ripley looked pretty good for a dead babe... ya, i know, she gets that a lot.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I don't know about the best but this is the first release of the year that really makes you stand up and notice. Being a huge At The Drive In fan I was worrying that this was wouldn't be half the band that ATDI was and I'll be damned if this band isn't two times the band the AtDI was. The Mars Volta is slightly progressive slightly hardcore slightly early Santana and all original. And you have to give credit to the band remaining tight and making everything flow where a lesser band would get lost in the vast amount of riffs that are featured in each song. Along with the two members of At The Drive In there are also two members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Flea plays bass on the whole album and John Frusciante helps out on the guitar solo fest that is &quot;Cicatriz&quot;. The best moments come in from &quot;Civatriz&quot; the mellow ballad &quot;Televators&quot; and the crazy Latin percussion driven &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot; although every song is memorable. I can't wait to hear what they do in the future.
B00004U8JV|3.0|This movie is truly a fall off and had to be.  Lost is the wonder we experienced when we say those dinos alive for the time.  But there is enough heart pounding excitement here to make this movie worthwhile.  It was a close call, but ultimately i did purchase the DVD.<br />A word about Jeff goldblum.  For me he was just an actors face in the crowd.  That spider movie was to creepy and not very much fun to watch.  But when you put his performance in the first 2 jurarassic parks, with Independence Day, which i liked a lot and i think very differently (positively) of Jeff then i see him in the credits now.
B000002JSN|5.0|This album is really good expect for three tracks. (in my time of dying, down on the seaside, and in the light). But don't let that discourage you from buying it. The rest of the tracks are so good it overpowers the bad songs on it.  This is when Led Zeppelin were still writing really good songs and this is them at some of their best. SO GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!
B00005V9IL|4.0|The first time i saw this I walked out thinking, &quot;what a stupid ending!&quot;  But I saw it again, and remember that i was loving this movie right up to the end.  I just didn't like the end.  So, we'll say here that for the first 80% it is a 5 star movie, giving it 4 stars.  <br />Hey, maybe you'll like the ending better than we did in the household far far away.
B00001IVOF|4.0|this cd is the best of the mobb because the slow scary like beats. there the best the mobb made. the infamous and j-hell are also good CDs. but this is the best.
B00000ILDE|5.0|It was the summer of 1979.  The weather was low humidity and no rain.  We popped the corn, packed up the kids and headed for the drive in on route 64 to a movie the kids wanted to see.  We always waited till the second feature started before leaving, letting traffic clear out.  <br />The second feature was a movie we never heard of ALIEN.  Little did we know that we had stumbled into a great movie.  This is one of the great SciFi-Horror movies of all times.  Only its sequel ALIENS is better.  This was even better on a big screen TV that watching it in a drivein theatre.<br />I never got to see ALIEN in a movie theatre a mistake I did not make when ALIENS came out.<br />Favorite line:  \\"I don't know if you been keeping up with current events, but we just got our asses kicked.\\"
0312263120|3.0|I could repeat what many have already said about how interesting and thrilling this novel is, but that would be repetative. I will simply say that I gave it less than a perfect review because Brown did the same thing so many authors do..made the female beautiful like that is a prerequisite for being brilliant. Just Once I wish an author would trust his/her audience to judge a character on their depth and not have to make then &quot;Eye turning&quot; beautiful. It is such a cliche and hurts every book that contains this stock female character. How many booms ahve you read where the female co-star walks into a restaurant and all eyes turn to gawk at her beauty. Enough already!
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is the almost perfect scarey movie.  everyone loves dinos.  Seeing them come back to life was wonderous.  Then the movie turns into a scary triller as good as any i have seen.

B00005221L|5.0|I saw this at the theatre knowing nothing about it.  I didn't see the trailers.  So for me I was thinking that it really was a story about the rescue of some soldiers and the mystery surrounding their disappearance.<br />Believe me, when the movie turned, that turn made it all the more enjoyable in a way that can't be repeated.  Even so, this is a movie that passed the &quot;Repeat Viewing&quot; test.
B00008AY3L|4.0|Ben Harper shows off his stylistic range on Diamonds on the Inside, and I think it works out for him.  I have only one complaint: whereas albums like Fight For Your Mind or Welcome To The Cruel World maintain a mood throughout the entire disc, Diamonds... changes it up.  This isn't bad though, it's just different.<br />Harper remains one of the few songwriters that can write openly christian lyrics and not annoy me (I like having to figure out what the song means to me, rather than having it told to me).<br />While not my favorite Ben Harper disc, this is still quite a good one.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Ridley Scott is one of the most visually prolific directors ever.  His films \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" alone are testaments to his talents, though the Roman epic \\"Gladiator\\" is one of his best, resurrecting Rome but at the same time delivering a classic Shakesperian story ripe with feeling and authenticity.  He employs an extraordinary cast, which include Russel Crowe who won an Academy Award for his portrayal as the fallen general Maximus.  Not to mention Joaquoin Phoenix is creepy and sullen as the coniving Commadus and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are wonderfully animated in their respective roles as Proximo and Marcus Aruelius.  And Connie Nielson is effective as Commadus' sister, who is terrified of mourning her slain father for her fear of her unstable brother.  <br />\\"Gladiator\\" starts off with a bang as the Roman Legions battle Germanic hoardes in the forests of Southern Germany.  It is spectacularily staged, with the stoic Russel Crowe (Maximus) leading the charge and hacking away at opposing fighters.  After the fight,  Maximus learns from the ailing Emperor Marcus Aruelius (Harris) that he is be the Emperors' heir, and not the Emperor's son, Commadus (Phoenix).  Commadus goes berserk and Maximus is forced to flee and he finds his family back home dead.  In despair, he wanders aimlessly collasping in an open plain and picked up by a group of Gladiator recruiters, led by a former Gladiator named Proximo (Reed).  From there, Maximus is a Gladiator fighting in pest-infested arenas, waiting for his chance to return to Rome and Commadus.<br />Even though big-budgets are routinely given out these days, \\"Gladiator\\" lives up to its epic title by being granted a $100 million-plus budget, and it shows.  The special effects are mega-sized, resurrecting the landmark Roman Coliseium  in all its glory.  When the gladiators enter to 50,000 screaming Romans, one cannot help but be in awe.  The visuals are not limited to computers though.  The costume and set designs are exquisitely detailed, down to the last thread of silk on Connie Nielsons' gowns.  \\"Gladiator\\" looks, smells and feels like ancient Rome.<br />Some people say that this movie is no more than overblown spectacle, devoid of a story worth following and empty acting all-around.  Now, everyone is entitled to their own opinion (with the internet you can just about read everyone's anyway) but I see \\"Gladiator\\" as a triumph as a modern-day epic.  It brims with equal parts visual splendor and genuine emotion, carried by restrained but stylistic direction and wondrous acting.  It succeeds at being both a feast for the eyes and as grand storytelling.  When Maximus bellows \\"Are you not entertained?!,\\" I will respond with a resounding \\"Yes.\\"
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones is going somewhere and my statement about that has nothing to do with grammy nominations.  All you have to do is listen to this album and you'll realize this is a voice and expression in modern jazz that we've been waiting for.  It's also, wonder of all wonders, the voice bringing jazz to the forefront in other musical genres, teaching those who would, not to box themselves in so tight they can't get out.  The only qualm I have with Ms. Jones is her tendency to lower her voice almost to a whisper at certain points, thus disallowing the listener to hear what she is saying and to glean from that understanding and meaning of the song's lyrics.  For this reason, the first time I heard the album I thought it was too flat, her voice too unemotional.  Then I played it again and was astounded by the expression to be found in her voice when one has gotten past the surface listen and is digging deeper.  &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; and &quot;Turn Me On&quot; are my favorite songs.
B000089RVX|4.0|Well, my sister had recently bought \\"Evanescence Fallen\\", and for once in a lifetime, there is actually something she likes that I like. Unlike her favorite Linkin Park, there is actually some talent that lies within this new uprising band. It represents rock and melodic in such a way that it basically copies over \\"Ambeon - Fate of a Dreamer\\" (which I highly suggest getting from Amazon.com, worth every penny!). The single \\"Bring to Life\\" kind of sucks. And unlike some bands, the single isn't what got me to \\"burn\\" this CD. The single represents the band's trial of being as different as possible while trying to blend the rappish Linkin Park tone, which made me disregard the band. So don't think the CD has that Rap in the background, it's just that one decent single (would be so much better if it wasn't like that!) Bottom line: the uniqueness of female vocals, heavy/hard background and the abnormal band title has proven at least to me, the music industry still has hope. One rant other then the single is that the CD is quite short. What is up with these bands and short CD's...and you wonder why people download music!
B000002H2H|5.0|The last of Metallica's independent releases, Ride the Lightning is notable not only for its outstanding lyrical and musical quality, but also for being the album that got Metallica its start.<br />Previously being published through local publisher Megaforce, Metallica was picked up by Elektra after this release, and with good reason.  From the acoustic beginning to the instrumental end, Ride the Lightning is one of the most unconventional albums ever released and, at the time, truly groundbreaking.  Mainstream-friendly classics like \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\" are side-by-side with hard hitting tunes like the title track, \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\", and \\"Creeping Death\\".  The album is finished off with a powerful instrumental called \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" which won Metallica a Grammy when it was redone on \\"S&M\\".<br />Overall this is a superb album and easily one of Metallica's finest.  I recommended both for metal enthusiasts and for anyone interested in checking out the best the genre has to offer.
B000002KDO|5.0|THIS &quot;Master Of Reality&quot; in Heavy Rock Dedication says: &quot;Lord of this World&quot; and &quot;Into the Void&quot; easily reach the level of POWER seen earlier (1970 for the debut year of LP's  &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;) in &quot;Hand of Doom&quot;, &quot;Electic Funeral&quot;, &quot;Rat Salad&quot; (a fierce instrumental), &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, &quot;Wicked World&quot;, &quot;The Wizard&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot; (though this anthem has been shamefully overplayed by alleged Classic Rock stations that fail to ACCEPT the depth of Black Sabbath through its first 7 LP's). The intro to &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; forever CHANGED this rocker back in 1982 -- when I finally realized the OFFICIAL roots of heavy rock at age 18. Several reasons for the late discovery, though I had well over 100 diverse LP's -- from Aerosmith to Kansas to AC/DC to Queen to Led Zepplin to RUSH to Steely Dan. I offer ZERO apologies to ANY Sabbath fans offended by the bands just mentioned BECAUSE (to re-assure) of the TEAM work of John (Ossie/Ozzy), Anthony (Tony), Terry (Geezer) AND William (Bill) a.k.a. Osborne-Iommi-Butler-Ward ARE the REAL &quot;Fab Four&quot; to come out of England (though OZZY and Ronnie James Dio credits &quot;The Beatles&quot; for shaping their careers). BACK to &quot;MASTER&quot; -- Every single track rates &quot;A&quot; (in the mid to high 90's percentile). Many THANKS to the producers, who listed the lyrics on the back album thus PROVING (without a shadow of a doubt) with &quot;After Forever&quot; that all of the SATANic accusations of Black Sabbath shall ALWAYS remain unbased and FALSE! Any fans who follow/worship Ozzy and Sabbath for such reasons are LOST Souls. Just take the music for what IT is -- Story Telling! Or like Howard Cosell says, the fathers of &quot;Heavy Rock&quot; were &quot;telling it like it WAS&quot; back in the torrid 1960's and '70's. &quot;Orchid&quot; is a solid 2-minute prelude to &quot;Lord of this World&quot;. Likewise for &quot;Embryo's&quot; piercing chords (in just 30 straight forward seconds) prepare loyal listeners for one of the greatest Sabbath anthems: &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;. This LP is NO Less THAN tied for the finest Sabbath LP effort AND is obviously my favorite because unlike &quot;Vol. 4&quot; (a great but very depressive collection in the light of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;) -- every single track is near perfection. Oh by the way -- finest track would actually appear on LP #5 in 1973 == &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot;...Look forward to meeting more great Sabbath listeners through the internet.. Take Care and (as Ozzy loves to declare) &quot;GOD Bless You ALL!&quot; .... &quot;the Coach --- #70 ---
0790729628|4.0|I bought this DVD expecting the original, but unfortunately this film has been edited. The DVD isn't even widescreen. Please, do yourself a favor and buy the VHS version, which is widescreen and isn't edited (as much). I don't know why people ruin a perfectly good film, because it was perfect as it was. No art form is ever 'perfect' per say, but it's more like c'est la vie. With so much editing, you lose the flavor of the spontaneity of the moment, which created so much of the great fireworks/special effects. The emotional impact is gone.<br />But at least the message is still clear. As a viewer, you will be enthralled with this. Just make sure you don't get the DVD, it sucks. Get the VHS with widescreen.
B00006F7S4|5.0|this album is truly a complete turn around for beck. going from this distortion based blend of hip-hop and country and about everything else, to this simple stream of melodic 'rainy day' music. but do not confuse my words with the phrase 'sell out', he's changed nothing more nothing less. i will also add that in order to truly enjoy this album you must LISTEN, it is very subtle in its tempo and chord changes, so one might think that it sounds rather repetative, but make no mistake this album is subtle genious.
B00009EIQE|4.0|On this disc Buddy pays tribute to Skip James, Willie Dixon, John lee Hooker and others in this 12 track acoustic cover CD.  It is a noble effort for Buddy and his vocals and guitar playing are in top form with guest appearances by Eric Clapton and BB King on a couple of tracks helping out on the guitar duties.  There is nothing new here but what is here is certainly worthwhile listening. Personally, I think Buddy's acoustic release, &quot;Alone and Acoustic&quot; with Junior Wells is better but that is another review.
B00005JKN9|2.0|This is a review of the DVD, not the film itself which was my favorite film of the year. In the months leading up to its release, news of the battles Scorsese had with the studios in editing it down to a sub-3 hour length acceptable to the studios were well published. Naturally I assumed that the DVD version would include the numerous scenes Scorsese was forced to cut out of the theatrical release. This is supposedly one of the advantages of DVD.<br />Nope.<br />Instead they included some nice documentary extras but none of the extra scenes. I strongly suspect the studio did this deliberately so that people would wind up buying two copies of the film. Don't be surprised if a few months from now they release a \\"Special Edition\\" including the cut scenes. They did this with \\"Blackhawk Down\\" and I'm sure they'll do it with \\"Gangs of New York\\". It's one thing for the studios to chop the film for a theatrical release but they should give us what the director originally wanted us to see on the DVD version.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown<br />To state the obvious, this book is a great page-turner, full of puzzles, foreshadowing, suspense, mystery, character surprises, humor and even a happy ending. To some, it will disturb the foundation of their faith and others may be launched into a study of the alternative theories of the history of Christianity. Although written as fiction, this author bases his novel on historical religious facts and controversial issues.<br />Not so obvious is the name the author gives to one of the leading characters, the curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, unless one has read \\"The Tomb of God\\" and \\"The Hiram Key,\\" both of which are not mentioned in this novel.  It may be that the author picked this particular surname because it is tied into those similar religious mysteries found in the other books. Abbe Berenger Sauniere (1852-1917) was the parish priest of the church of St. Mary Magdalene at Rennes-le-Chateau, France where he discovered certain parchments buried in a wall and allegedly turned the Abbe into a very wealthy person. It is also alleged that this was the church where one of the kings of the Merovingians, Dagobert II married Visigoth princess, Gizelle de Razes. Why the connection? It is about the Priory of Sion and Mary Magdalene's connection to this town. For more on that mystery, read the \\"Tomb of God.\\"<br />The first name of Jacques is also the historical name of Jacques De Molay. In 1292 he was the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. In 1307 after the infamous Friday the thirteenth round up of the Knights, he was crucified, but not killed until seven years later. For more on that mystery and the Rosslyn Chapel, read \\"The Hiram Key.\\"<br />Brown toys with names, such as Bishop Aringarosa, the character who goes around in circles, perhaps suggesting the song, A ring around the rosie...We all fall down. Further, could it suggest sub-rosa, a ring for the Rosa? Still other names and places point out character traits and connections to the mystery.<br />From Fibonacci's numbers, Lewis Carroll's mirror code, Da Vinci's work, the Priory of Sion and other religious, controversial issues, this author knows where Newton's apple falls and has come up with this fast paced plot twister and best seller. \\"How dark the con of Man.\\" ...smiling all the way to the bank.<br />Jack Mellone 6/29/03nnections to the mystery.<br />From Fibonacci's numbers, Lewis Carroll's mirror code, Da Vinci's work, the Priory of Sion and other religious, controversial issues, this author knows where Newton's apple falls and has come up with this fast paced plot twister and best seller. \\"How dark the con of Man.\\" ...smiling all the way to the bank.<br />Jack Mellone 6/29/03
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard Coldplay's Clocks as a tribute to former SF Giant manager, Dusty Baker at Pac Bell Park.  I had to find out who this group was and emailed the baseball team directly.  The entire album is AMAZING.  In particular, I enjoyed the piano heavy ballads:  The Scientist, Clocks and Amsterdam.  I'm not usually a big CD buyer of alternative rock but this was a MUST HAVE.
B00008O31H|4.0|These guys are very original. They sound nothing, absolutely nothing like the White Stripes. <br />Yes, they are on a blues label. So what? They are good. Beyond tracing a lineage, at a certain point, you just have to listen to the music by itself.<br />Listen to the music, folks. Don't be so affected by what magazines focus on. Don't be afraid to form an opinion based on your reaction to the music, not who you think they sound like.
B00004SGNM|5.0|This review refers to the SACD version of this classic album. From reading other reviews of the SACD of CYNDI LAUPER, SHE'S SO UNUSUAL, one gets the feeling that the SACD version has a different mix than the black vinal or the standard CD of the same title. This just is not so! The SACD version of this excellent CYNDI LAUPER album has the same exact mix as all of the previous versions, but the SACD really rocks. Confusion might arise regarding an engineers sound mastering and an engineers sound mixing of music, and that is understandable.When an artist goes to the studio to record a song, they do so on a multi-channel tape machine. These original mixdown tapes, which often contain 8, 16 or even 32 tracks of information, contain the information which correlates to individual instruments and vocal takes. These original mixdown tapes are then mixed together to create a final version of the song that contains all of the different elements from the various instuments and vocals. This original master tape of an artists product usually contain just two channels, a right and a left channel, and it is this version that we, the consumer, listen to on the radio and from CDs. It is important to note, that a remastered disc does not mean remixed, it means that an engineer went back to the original master tape and tweaked the sound of the two channel information to clean up the distortion, or to otherwise make some minor adjustments to the sound quality.That is exactly what this SACD version of SHE'S SO UNUSUAL contains, a remastered edition of this classic album, not a remixed version. You can rest assured that when you play this SACD you will hear the same mix of vocals and instruments that you are familar with, but with a new vibrancy and clearness that will blow you away. As a very huge fan of this classic album, I can tell you that this SACD version blows away every other version for sound quality. Once you listen to the SACD of SHE'S SO UNUSUAL, you will be CYNDI LAUPER fanforever.
B000092ZYY|5.0|This cd is good from the beginning to end and not only does Thom Yorke showcase some of the finest singing of his career but they also smartly and dramatically switch between more electronic pieces and more traditional sounding selections. I've only listened to this cd a few times but I have a feeling it's going to become my favorite Radiohead cd ever. It's greatest power is that it manages to be more human than Kid A and Amnesiac but still experiments with some very unusual musical elements. A must have.
0385504209|5.0|I read this book in one sitting! Whether or not you agree with some of the author's presuppositions, it is a masterfully written suspense thriller.  Definitely a must read and would make a great movie.  However, I am afraid that most people will accept his theological assumptions on face value.  You must read it to know what I am talking about.
B000089RVX|4.0|I haven't bought a CD for a &quot;New&quot; band in a long time, but the song Bring Me to Life really just brought tears to my eyes the first time I heard it on the radio and I thought, who the hell is this?<BR>I almost bought the Daredevil soundtrack instead of this but I am extremely happy they didn't have a copy of it in the store. This band is amazing, I haven't heard music that caused this much emotional reaction from me since the early 1990's.<BR>The vocals of Amy Lee are just beautiful and the tracks of Bring Me to Life, My Immortal and Imaginary are nothing short of phenominal. A couple of the songs sound similar to each other but this is definitly a band to keep listening too and I look forward to future CDs from this group. They are so refreshing and new, I don't think I've ever heard music like this before. The beauty of Amy's voice and the strong drum and Guitars also mixed at times with a delicate piano melody are a great combination.
B000099T2L|1.0|This C.D. is not worth the purchase. First of all the music is decent, but Beyonce's voice becomes rather annoying with her constantly screaming in the background. Another thing- the cd case does not include the lyrics. It just shows all the people who worked on the c.d. NO LYRICS. Any decent song-writer would know enough to put their proud lyrics, but not beyonce. AHH this cd is so frusterating.. I wish i didn't buy the c.d. I'll try to give it away as a gift. Doubt anyone would want it.                                                                      Take Michelle Branch's &quot;Hotel Paper&quot;, which was released the same date as Beyonce's. Michelle Branch added her lyrics, pictures of herself, and as a little joke &quot;Thank you to whwatever high power is out there. 'cause i know you read album sleeves all the time.&quot;. Beyonce on the other hand does't have any of that.                                                                                                                                      As i looked at the recommendations, I was surprised to see so many people recommend michelle branch as opoosed to beyonce. I grabbed a copy of michelle's cd too when i bought this (same release date) and i am def. listening to michelle branch more.                                                                                                                                        I am a very big r&amp;b fan, and hip hop, and rap and i'm eagerly anticipating Destiny's Child's new album. I'll give Beyonce another chance, despite this horrible c.d. cause she has so many better other ones. SHE SHOULD NOT GO SOLO. don't buy this album, it's just amazing how stupid i felt when i bought, listened, and looked at this album. AHH.
B00005JKN9|5.0|While a huge, grandiose film like \\"Gangs....\\" belongs on the big screen, the transfer to DVD is quite satisfying. I purchased this at midnight and have only had the chance to watch it 3 times, but my admiration for this film has only deepened since I last saw it. Scorsese outdoes himself on this one. The attention to detail, period costumes and richly hued tones make this one the most convincing period pieces since Kubrick's \\"Barry Lyndon\\". Naturally, Daniel Day-Lewis owns this movie from scene one and the screenplay fairly crackles with hate, bile, humor and violence everytime he opens his mouth. Cameron Diaz is entirely unnecassary in her role as Jenny and merely serves as a distraction from the real story of revenge. Leonardo DiCaprio wisely plays it low key in a role that may have been an embarrassment, but he gives Amsterdam a slow-burning, quiet rage that manages to keep everyone around him wondering what his true intentions are. The extras on this 2 disc set are outstanding, including a great commentary from the director and a historical featurette about the real gangs that inspired this brilliant film. All in all, \\"Gangs....\\" is a well packaged, concise and complete DVD package that will not dissapoint fans and may even win some new devotee's and inspire a new generation of film fanatics.<br />A great movie and even better DVD. Well worth the wait!
6305297207|5.0|I'm sure I don't really need to add my review to the pile, but here I go.  The first of three (too bad there's not more) is awesome!  I saw it at the drive-in movies a long time ago with some stoner friends and we all went crazy over it.  Sam Raimi is a movie genius and did so many really cool effects on such a low budget.  This is the type of movie that makes a cult classic a cult classic.  I am a lifetime Evil Dead fan!  Bruce rules!!
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought this album for my 14-year-old daughter, and she brought it along on a recent road trip.  I already liked the four releases from the CD, and when I listened to the complete CD, I was amazed to hear that every single song was a winner.  Very talented little gal.
B00004U2A1|5.0|You can see that Bruce started coming into his style as a smart alec hero in this movie.  The Evil Dead tilogy is the king of all B movies hands down!  If you like the movies, check out Bruce's book \\"If Chins Could Kill, The Confessions of a B Movie Actor\\".  It has plenty of Evil Dead facts and trivia.

0783227434|5.0|Sam is a bada$$. In this third chapter of the Evil Dead trilogy, he sets up Bruce fully into his wise-a$$ Ash character.  You can see the Three Stooges influences in the graveyard scene.  Chock full of puppet skeletons, and fire-hose blood gushing, this movie lands right on top of the B movie pile.  Hail to the King, baby.

B00004XOWM|1.0|That title is a good summary.  This entire CD, as well as the rest of Limp Bizkit's albums are.  Rap and metal DON'T MIX, and I really wish that many of the nu-metal bands could realize this.  It's been done, and it clearly shouldn't be done again.  While the bass lines on this album are relatively good and fun to play, the guitar, drums, and vocals ruin it.  ... I feel sorry for Puddle of Mudd, who were signed and discovered by [Fred Durst].  Unlike LB, Puddle of Mudd has talent, and it's just a shame that they fell in the shadow of their ... benefactor.  DJ Lethal is just... there.  He barely does anything to make the \\"music\\" better, and it just makes his prescense more annoying.  Guitarist Wes Boreland (the only member with any hint of talent) left the band about a year after the release of this album... I can't believe he took so long.  This music is PURE $ELL OUT POP ROCK!!  I mean... even Limp's guitarist left because he knew the band was sold out.  That's just sad.  The music is terrible, and the band is awful.  Save yourself the pain on the ears and don't get this.  It is just sad that this band got a record deal.  Excruciating.
B00006LLNU|4.0|They almost pull it off, but they come up a bit short.<BR>Still worth a listen, just keep your expectations in line.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce's album proves her talent and ability to write amazing music. When I purchased the album I was expecting a lot of club hits, however, most of the album is slow jams- which is a suprise. Although, slow, the songs are intricate and are great to &quot;chill&quot; to. I definitly recommend it to anyone who likes artists such as Kelly Price, Floetry or Whitney. There are a number of Jazzy/blusey tunes. Great solo Beyonce!
B000002MQ9|5.0|This album takes everything you know and completely devastates you with what you'll never know.<BR>This Band makes you yearn for a soft place with a lover you'll never have.<BR>This music enters your soul and burns it to a crisp.
0446608955|5.0|This book was amazing!  it really taught you that even if you don't plan on falling in love, it will happen and you will be glad that you did.  This book really makes you go on a rollercoaster of emotions.  I don't usually cry unless the book is extremely heart touching. Mr. Sparks outdid himself when he wrote this book.  All the different characters were perfectly put together in such a way that it was heart-wrenching.  I HIGHLY reccommend this book if you enjoy romance and if you like to feel different emotions.
B000088E6D|5.0|It's so rare when a new talent comes along that totally captivates. It happened to us in the 1980s when Miami Sound Machine gained national exposure and again in the 1990s when LeAnn Rimes burst into the music world with &quot;Blue.&quot; Now, here comes a young Canadian whose singing brilliance is nothing shy of startling. He's Michael Bubl (pronounce that boo-BLAY) and he's on a rocket ride to vocal fame. This initial, self-titled CD was released February 21 and has already hit GOLD in Canada. He is heard as part of the soundtrack in a new Renee Zellwegger film released in May. This guy's career is on fire -- deservedly so. If you're a fan of big band music or love to dance or just appreciate great singing, add this CD to your music collection right away. It's in ours! While a  scant few of the tempos among the 13 selections are suitable only for gentle swaying (a nice pastime, nevertheless), Bubl delivers a variety of song interpretations that range from soft ballads (&quot;That's All&quot;) to Elvis-like rock and roll (&quot;Crazy Thing Called Love&quot;) to Sinatra-style swinging (&quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;) to a brisk cha-cha (&quot;Sway&quot;) and subtle rumba/bolero (&quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;) that are beyond outstanding. Listen to his music and see if you don't find yourself thinking about the Bee Gees, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Jack Jones, Lou Rawls, Mel Torm, Stevie Wonder, Vic Damone and more. The quality of Michael's voice and his phrasing seems like the reincarnation of  them all -- only better! He is fortunate, too, that so many talented musicians were involved in arranging and playing the  sparkling instrumental backings. They're just, plainly, superb. With much enthusiasm, we look forward to hearing more of this beautiful voice for a long, long time. This musical marvel is only 25 years old!

B00005JM1F|4.0|Old School was very interesting. The movie starts out with a lame beginning.The beginning was unoriginal, thus, making it not funny. The middle section has some good cameos. The last thirty minutes are a huge disappointment. There are no humorous scenes, and I lost my interest from there. Also, the movie doesn't explain a.) what \\"Frank the Tank\\" does for a living, because he never seems to be at work b.) how Mitch could afford a house across the street from a college c.) why Mitch would buy a house he obviously could not afford to lease. If you liked Road Trip, you will most likely like Old School.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This is just one great movie. It'll make you laugh with it's querky sense of humor, and will awe you with it's wonderful story. A note-perfect cinematic event whose immortality was assured from its opening night, Amadeus is an unlikely candidate for the director's-cut treatment. The last thing you would expect a high school junior to go ga-ga over is a movie about long-dead classical composers. Screenwriter Peter Shaffer adapted the work from his own play, a fictional history meditating on the lives of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and musical rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). All is told in flashback through the eyes of Salieri, who sees Mozart as a vulgar creature with divine gifts. Eventually, Salieri views Mozart's music as an insult from God, and he tries to undermine the young composer at every opportunity. During this time you just can't help but laugh, because everytime he thinks he's got something Mozart shows him up. It's a great film, and must be seen by everyone. It's to good to be kept to one's self.
B000089RVX|4.0|Normally, I wait until after a few songs have been released before I buy a CD to see if I like it, baring it being from a group I already know or like.  Rarely do I buy a CD where I've heard just one song.  However, when I heard the song &quot;Bring me to life&quot; on the radio and found myself waiting with baited breath for it to come back over the waves (my station didn't play it often enough), I knew over my better judgment that I had to get this disc.  For a freshman album, it's not bad.  The vocals are mostly pleasing and the instruments are right on.  Most of the songs on the album have turned out good enough to warrant buying the disc.  I have to admit that I enjoyed the lyrics in themselves.  They are hauntingly spiritual and may betray a religious dimension to the lyricist.  However, some of the lyrics are slightly disturbing in their conception.  For example, the song tourniquet seems to exist to have only the word tourniquet somewhere in the lyrics, which is certainly sad for its lack of creativity.  All in all, however, the good outweighs the bad and I'm not dissatisfied with my purchase.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was great. I have also read the books. Although there were differences I feel that they don't really matter. Stop complaining about minor details and enjoy the movie! I'm sure there are some things that you would have changed, but that doesn't matter. If you're really that disappointed make your own version and stop complaining.
0385504209|5.0|I just finished this whirlwind of a book last night, and I am completely speechless.  I'm not even sure what to say here except that The Da Vinci Code has to be the best, most intellectually written and fascinating thriller I've read...ever!  Kudos to Dan Brown for creating this exceptional, brilliant tale.<br />The Da Vinci Code is a richly layered mystery involving codes, symbolism, historical theories, and secret societies.  The curator of the Louvre museum in Paris, Jacques Sauniere, is found murdered inside, but before his final moments, he was able to leave a hidden message behind.  Authorities call in reknowned American symbologist, Robert Langdon, to help decipher the code.  But Sauniere, a master code writer himself, did not make this an easy task, even for an expert.  Langdon thus embarks on a roller coaster ride, sending him on a feverish chase throughout Europe, into churches and chateaus, in a desperate search for answers.<br />I loved this book and couldn't wait to see how it would end.  I was glued to my seat for hours on end because I absolutely couldn't make myself stop reading.  I learned a lot about Da Vinci, as well, and now my interest in him and his paintings have been piqued.  A lush, vivid landscape and an eerie tone throughout, The Da Vinci Code wins hands-down as my favorite book of the year.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love this album. Beyonce shows just how talented she is on this  album . Her writing and vocal skills are so superb. I love the sevinties soul music vibe in this album. This music is really wonderful  and I belive we've only yet begun to  see all of Beyonce talent.
6305181772|5.0|First of all, there is a reason why this film is so great. Brian De Palma directed it! De Palma is a master visualist and this movie looks like none other. De Palma makes complete use of depth within the frame and his visual style is unmatched by any director working today (Scorsese being the exception) so this film (unlike MI2) holds up and is still interesting &amp; riveting after repeated viewings. MI2 is a stupid, cliched plot with lotsa action and explosions I have already seen. This one really makes you think when you watch it and the way the spy/action/suspense scenes are directed &amp; handled are wonderful. Also, a great script from David Koepp &amp; the legendary Robert Towne
0385504209|4.0|It keeps your interest 3/4 of the way through the book. Unfortunately, it appears all the author's research and clever storytelling falls victim to a rather loose-ended, 'I wrote the ending in one afternoon' finale. It would have been hard to write a believable ending anyway. Still a good read. Two obvious blunders in a highly detailed and researched book (they aren't pivotal to the plot). Adam was offered a 'fruit' in the bible not an 'apple' and Sir Isaac Newton was a virgin his whole life.
B00006X06U|1.0|Listening to your own press releases can be a disastrous hobby. Too many performers believe they can walk on water, and not even get their shoes wet.

019431510X|4.0|I will not repeat what other reviewers have said about this classic learner's dictionary. It has been a valuable reference for ESL students for many decades. I own several learner's dictionaries published recently (Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 4th Edition, Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, and Collins Cobuild 3rd edition) and some of them have features this one does not have. But I still use this dictionary a lot and will continue to use it. I hope a new edition of it will come out soon.
B000002NIW|5.0|If the Deftones know how to do one thing, they know how to ROCK. I think pretty much any fan of the 'Tones would agree that this album is their heaviest. For those of you who only know the band from their last two albums, you might be a little surprised at this one. Now, yes, there is melody, and lots of it. &quot;Mascara&quot; is probably the best example of that. Most of the songs do have melody, but are quite LOUD. The hardest song on the album (and arguably the best) is &quot;Lotion&quot;. It kicks in with Chino with his infamous scream, then he starts kind of talk-rapping over a powerful guitar riff, and then for the chorus he sings like an angel. The most severe moment of the album? Hmmm....it's between the end of &quot;Lotion&quot; and the end of &quot;Headup&quot;. Another interesting factoid: if you listen to &quot;Headup&quot;, (which features former Sepulatura frontman Max Cavalera) you will learn how Max got the name for his current band, Soulfly.<br />Is this the hardest album in the world? No. But it will not only keep your ears ringing, but it will have you singing along as well. Recommended.<br />Well, go on. Click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button.
0800177975|4.0|LAH is a lot of fun if you're willing to keep two mindsets at hand and switch between them on demand -- because LAH suffers from having multiple screenwriters with wildly divergent attitudes toward the concept: fluffy parody (seen mainly in Slater's world) and fairly dark satire (in \\"ours\\").  It's two halves of two good films edited together, and they don't blend _at all_.  In one half, the comedy sidekick bounces across housetops on his bicycle with no harm done and all the bullets miss our heroes; in the other, the hero, angst-ridden since the death (debatably, murder) of his son, ends up in a traffic-stuck ambulance dying graphically in blood and agony.<br />Oil and water would look positively emulsified by comparison.<br />But it's an _interesting_ film, especially for the type of people who like to argue over issues like creators' moral responsibility toward their characters.  (\\"...I don't really like you.  You've brought me nothing but pain.\\"  -- J Slater to A Schwarzenegger)<br />I grant that the animated cat does not belong in the picture at all.
B00003CXCW|5.0|What can one say about \\"Sunset Boulevard\\"?  If you haven't seen it, see it!  If you've seen it, watch it again!<br />This is one of those films that illustrates how stunningly beautiful black and white can be.  The mood, the atmosphere that Wilder creates is unlike any other film.  Others have tried, but none have succeeded.<br />Norma Desmond is one of the most unforgettable characters captured on film.  As portrayed by Gloria Swanson, she's funny, tragic, scary, sad, manipulative, vulnerable, and every inch the star, however faded she may be.<br />No matter what your area of interest, be it as a film maker, writer, actor, cinematographer, or film buff, \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is required viewing.  Any one remotely involved with or interested in film can learn volumes from this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|this is one of the best albums of the year 2002. and probably will figure in the years 2000-2010 top ten rock albums. just how many albums could you find these days with 10 out of eleven songs that actually ROCK? traumatizing voice, efficient riffs, amazing keyboard playing and intelligent songwriting make this a must. the slightly gothic tint adds even more charm to the whole opus. i love evanescence and i can hardly wait for their next album.
B000002OX5|4.0|This was certainly a unique idea at the time.  Put fake commercials between the songs and have it be like a radio broadcast.  It is mostly successful, but not completely.  It includes my personal favorite Who number, \\"I Can See For Miles\\", which was also the group's only Top Ten hit in the U.S. The thing that dissapointed me most about this CD is the bonus tracks.  For the most part, they aren't as good as the songs that were included on the original album.  Of course, that's probably why they were left off of the album in the first place.
B000005HLV|5.0|if the word black metal would be existing in dictionaries, this album's picture would be appearing right next to it. too much has been said about this release and i dont know what is it i ought to be adding. just one of those rare albums that have an intense visual quality as well as musical, and which stay engraved in your head forever after, whether you hated or loved it.
B00008DDXB|3.0|I have not read any of the Harry Potter books, so you can be assured that my views have not been polluted by comparison with the books.<BR>Harry Potter and The Chamber Of secrets (the movie) is hardly a match for the first of its kind. It is perhaps, the element of novelty, that was lost in the 2nd movie.<BR>The first movie was NEW. The very concept was entirely fascinating and unexpected. It was the first time Harry ever heard of Hogwarts or discovered his 'powers', as most people of today love to put it. His life, too, changed from the ordinary to the extaordinary- which was, if I may say so, shown very well. The surprise of the viewer was shared by Harry Potter, as neither the viewer nor Harry had ever come across any of all that before. <BR>The second movie suffers in comparison with its predecessor. It, for some odd reason, has an air of staleness...of decadance.  For the 2nd movie, newness was just not an option (afterall, it was the SECOND one), so it had to have that something extra- that extra attraction. THIS extra attraction is what it lacked.<BR>Nevertheless, it is very imaginative, has good effects, and is almost very good, (if not compared with the first one).<BR>But, what can one do, one just has to get out of this monotonous world, and enter that of fantasy; and for that, watching any Harry Potter movie seems a plausible method!
B00005IC2H|5.0|After the first listen to this album by a quartet of Iclandic lads you don't know what you've just heard. There's nothing like Afaetis Byrjun. There's nothing as mystical, calming, elegant, ect. It's a combination of thick, soft bass, haunting drums, a guitar played with a violin bow, soothing piano riffs, and a falsetto lead voice that feels like just another instrument. It's flawless. If it doesn't relax you into a state of unconcisousness it will blow your mind. The second track, &quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot; has one of the most digestable and capturing melodies in music. The moment in &quot;Ny Batteri&quot; when the drums kick in is overwhelming. The split seconds of silence in the middle of &quot;Staraflur&quot; leading back into the song will put goosebumps on your arms. The most diffinative track on the album is &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; with it's infectious chorus melody that will hum you to sleep. 10/10 Highlights: &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; &quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot; &quot;Staraflur&quot; &quot;Ny Batteri&quot; &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;

B00007KQA3|4.0|1984 is an exceptionally successful adaptation of a well known novel, which is perhaps the best way of understanding its qualities. Brilliantly designed, directed, shot and edited, the film brings Orwell's nightmare vision of a decaying Oceania to tangible life. It is difficult to decide which to praise more, the film's technical achievements, the concisely condensed script that economically dramatizes most of Orwell's themes, or the superb performances. John Hurt manages the difficult task of taking Everyman Winston Smith beyond a literary abstraction into a fully rounded human being. Outstanding as his achievement is, however, the real kudos should go to Richard Burton's utterly soulless O'Brien, the embodiment of velvety, degenerate power hunger. Burton's last performance, it is also probably his best on film.<br />1984 certainly is not a movie for everyone, however. Its relentlessly downbeat tone, understated horror and slow, quiet pace are likely to turn off most viewers. The film's extreme success in conveying a sense of dank and disintegration are likely to make you want to take a shower afterwards. The torture scenes are harrowingly affective, and forget the possibility of being spared any of it. (Readers of Orwell's novel can at least get some satisfaction from reading the postscript about Newspeak, written in a reassuring past tense that establishes some distance between the story's events and the present. The film offers no such relief.)<br />The American theatrical release of 1984 included a score by the Eurythmics. This edition uses the original orchestral score of strings and English horn, which is considerably more understated and moody. While the orchestral score is almost *too* perfect for the film's hushed mood, the Eurythimcs track has always struck me as a little inappropriate. (Viewers interested in seeing the film with the Eurythmics score should track down a copy of the laserdisc issued a few years back.) Forced to choose, I'd opt for the orchestral score, if for no other reason than it was what was originally intended. Both scores bring different pluses and minuses, however.<br />If you haven't read Orwell's novel in a while, you might want to watch this film, then go back to the book to see just how much of its mood, texture and thematic sophistication the film makers have captured. 1984 is literary cinema at its best.
B000069AUI|5.0|yeah, I heard yellow, like everyone else, but at the time i didn't really like it, i guess i thought it was ok. but then i heard In My Place and i was really impressed. I really like the melody of this song, and the vocals are a good match for it. this song sorta helped me get thru the first semester of school. then i heard clocks, and i immediately rushed out to get this cd, cuz in my opinion clocks was probably coldplays best song, certainly one of the most beautiful i've ever heard. then i listened to the cd, and i thought the best tracks (beside the first two singles) were God Put a Smile On Your Face, Daylight, Warning, and A Rush Of Blood To The Head. and Amsterdam was good too, then again this whole cd was good, so i suggest you buy it if you already haven't.
B00008AWOD|3.0|Annyone who happen to have seen \\" Teenage Angst \\" , one of the first Placebo video-clips back in the mid 90's will probably remember that those three guys dressed in red,jumping on the rubber walls of an also red box in which they were locked in were sending out that same something they so seem to lack today : freshness .      Their latest offering \\" Sleeping with Ghosts \\" displays once more that Molko and his buddies are talented musicians . From a generally good tracklist at least four songs ( This Picture , Bitter End , the tittle track and Special Needs ) have what it takes to be released as cd singles . They are powerful gripping melodies all well perfomed by the so unusual voice of singer Brian Molko . People who will be introduced to Placebo with this album will surely be satisfied if nothing more . Yet a person who once cherished the energy and nerve of their 1995 debut and the emotional storm of \\" Withought You Im Nothing \\" will probably demand more than just a slightly lo-fi mix of these two albums since that was the role their third Lp \\" Black Market Music \\" played .     Placebo were a band which , despite it's somehow eccentric image , had won a special place in the heart of their fans for offering them so much excitment with their music. That's not to say that they still don't rock nowadays cause they do . Yet it's easy to tell that they've run out of ideas . There's nothing new or original in \\" Sleeping With Ghosts \\" to imply that they're aiming to win a wider audience nor is there a change of direction to a more experimental sound . A rap and rock combination track on \\" Black Market Music \\" implied changes coming . Saddly they didn't . The band seems to feel fine about where they stand now yet the trick in the whole case is that fans change and what was great listening for a certain period of one's life doesn't mean that it will be great forever . To be able to capture the interest of people , a group needs not to be static .      Although still a respectable piece of music , \\" Sleeping With Ghosts \\" shows a band in serious need of reinveting itself . 4 stars if you're new to Placebo , 2 stars if you're not .
B000002AZ8|2.0|Vitalogy alienated Pearl jam from the mainstream and most of thier original fans, including myself. They have been adrift ever since, trying desperately to avoid thier grunge roots. When a band has no purpose or direction it's time to stop. Pearl Jam havent showed any direction since Vs. On Vitalogy it seems like Pearl Jam began to make music just because they can. The album is very disjointed and the melodies sound repetitive and offkey. &quot;Betterman&quot; is the only memorable good song. 'Corduroy' could have been a classic if it had been performed with the energy of thier previous albums. I now look at Pearl Jam like a 20 something year old who wants to get serious with thier life but doesn't know what to do or where to go.
6305907145|1.0|This movie is not worthy of being called a Jane Austen classic! The characters are not true to the book and the story has been monkeyed with as well. The social statements made are ones we may find pivitol for today, but were not primary issues of the 18th century and certainly not issues in this particular book. Buy any of the other recent J.A. movies - they're all worth your time and money - but leave this one on the shelf.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Is this it is a tremendous debut album and is definately worth checking out. I could not find a single weak track on the album. It's simple but very addictive and enjoyable, like all the greatest rock n roll albums are. Gorgeous melodies, not at all cheesey. The vocals sound like they're coming out of an old PA system from the 50s. The music is just so fresh and charming. People waiting for the next Linkin Park album will probably not 'get' this. The rest of you with taste, you know what to do.
0066214122|4.0|Once again, Michael Crichton issues a foreboding caveat of our damnable future in his latest offering, Prey.  This time around, his premonition originates from the burgeoning science of nanotechnology.  Of course, as in all of Crichton's books, man's selfish pursuit for power, money, and fame consume his antagonists into an all-encompassing quest of self-indulgence.  This undoubtedly leads to chaos and man's loss of control of this powerful, yet arcane, technology.<br />Crichton being one of the few modern authors that I enjoy reading, I have enjoyed virtually all of his books.  Prey, although a little less substantive than some of his other books, nonetheless proves to be a fun, entertaining, and thought-provoking book worth a look.  Prey, if nothing else, is a page-turner that you will fly through enjoyably in a couple of days.

B000099T2L|1.0|Sex seems to be the only thing on her mind now, like 75% of her mind. I was hoping to learn more about her as an artist but I was left hanging.  Well I guess she has to be nasty to compete.  I was expecting her to give more vocally and more creatively. I wasn't impressed and to use a song off of the survivor cd was just plain tacky, she should have saved that song for CD in the first place.  The Daddy song was sweet though!!!
B000068TPN|4.0|This is an intense, pull-no-punches film dealing with an Air Calvary battalion in combat in South Vietnam in 1965.  Mel Gibson, as Lt. Col Hal Moore, commanding, puts in an outstanding performance.  Gibson is intense and true-to-life without overdoing the role (which would have been easy to do given the nature of the film).  This film does not glorify war, but does recognize the bravery (and flaws/weaknesses) of the soldiers who fought a hard, tough, thankless war because, in the end, it was their duty.<br />One thing the film does that most war films do not is focus on the home front, both before and during the battle.  Despite this, this is neither a pro-war or an anti-war story.  I thought that it did a pretty good job of recognizing both the skill and heroism of the soldiers on the one hand, and the tragedies that war inevitably entails on the other.  Unlike some other movies that have dealt with the Vietnam war, this film does not portray the American Army in a negative light, which is frankly refreshing, and perhaps reflective of the high esteem in which most Americans hold the military in the present day.<br />Too intense for children, but a very fine and powerful war story that will hold the interest of most viewers.
B0000640VO|5.0|I usually don't write reviews about movies because of my lack of time but this one really moved me.  Amelie is an excellent work, a story full of sensibility and fantasy.  All its components; the crew, the story, the cinematography compound a perfect armony.  I bought it and I enjoyed from beginning to end.  Really enchanting!!!!
B00005JLYU|3.0|As with many films of this genre, the viewer is forced to dispense with some sense of reality to really get into the film... this movie ups the ante by having the angels perform stunts that defy the laws of physics and common sense. The sequences are so clever and well choreographed, however, you just find yourself with a smile on your face as your jaw drops just a little - followed by a chuckle as you realize how impossible such a scenario would be.<br />If the angels were pitched against James Bond, 007 would be beaten - badly. These girls kick butt. The film has a lot to offer - men see sexy women wearing revealing clothes, while driving incredible cars and using secret agent gadgets. Women see three best friends who are strong, powerful, multi-talented and intelligent.<br />There is no end to the amount of talent these girls possess. They can ride or drive just about any vehicle ever created, they are fluent in many languages, they are more limber than most house cats, they are fearless and they work great under pressure.<br />Bernie Mac is a welcome addition to the team. He can be funny just by breathing - and he has a few scenes where he is able to showcase his talent.<br />The hype over Demi Moore's appearance in the film isn't very over-rated. She must do Pilates 2 hours a day, every day of her life... she really looks like she was chiseled out of marble. There has been some criticism about her acting, which I think is unfounded. The whole story is very tongue-in-cheek... at no time are you really worried that someone is going to die and at no time is the viewer overly moved by even the tender scenes.  Demi Moore's character wasn't fully developed enough for her to really build on. You learn that she is a loner and a troubled soul, but you are never told what exactly made her that way.<br />The strength of this movie is in the non-stop action and the humor and friendship of the 3 angels. The rest of the movie is just fluff. It is obvious that Lucy, Drew and Cameron really are close friends - there is no way to fake that type of rapport. Theater goers should stay through the entire credits to the end to see out-takes and funny moments experienced by the actors.<br />After the action is over and the lights come on, you begin to realize what a stupid premise the entire film revolves around. The situation that begins at the beginning of the film and is (of course) resolved in the end, is just ridiculous - but does anyone go to see a Charlie's Angels movie expecting great intellectual stimulation?<br />Fast cars, explosions, motorcycles, acrobatics and major butt-kicking abound in this film - the opening action scene is like no other action scene anyone has ever seen - perposterous, but inventive enought to make you think, &quot;wow!&quot;<br />In our troubled world, we all need a little escape once in a while and despite the violence (gun play, butt kicking, etc.), a viewer really can escape while watching this film. It's highly enjoyable, but probably not a film most  would want to see over and over again.Cameron really are close friends - there is no way to fake that type of rapport.

B00005JLXE|1.0|This has to be the worst Marvel movie ever. The movie is not true to the comic at all. First of all, Daredevil's origin is completely changed (he became blind when he saved a man from crossing the street!). The movie also has terrible casting. Sure, Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell did great as their characters, but Jennifer Garner as Elektra?!? Pleaase...Elektra is supposed to be a deadly assassin with looks to die for. And oh yeah, Greek also. Casting for the Kingpin was terrible as well. Michael Clarke Duncan might be a very big person, but he is not Wilson Fisk. Way too many characters were introduced at once, completely ruining the movie. Directors need to stop trying to make movies based on comics for non-comic readers; they should be made for fans who read the comics and stay true to the original stories. Marvel and Avi Arad: Stop ruining good comics like Daredevil and the Hulk with movies with weak story lines!
B00005M91K|5.0|i saw baraka for the first time about a month ago and was hooked. i drove to cape town to watch the new movie by godfrey reggio called naquoiqatsi at the cinema nouveao. well, i am now a true fan and i would love to own and see powaqqatsi and koyaanisqatsi.
B00005NWLO|3.0|First off, I'm an accomplished guitar player.  Not some 1st year guitarist who listens to the Freebird solo and thinks he's found the Gods of rock and roll.  Second, I was a HUGE Skynyrd fan during the seventies and eighties.  I learned ALL their songs.  That said, this is NOT the album to buy if you are either just getting started as a Skynyrd fan or want to buy a collection of hits.  As a live concert recording, it's sloppy in both recording and musicianship. Don't get me wrong.  I loved seeing Skynyrd in concert and they could jam with the best of them.  This was not their best performance.  The songs themselves are not the best choices you could have on a collections CD.  I recommend you instead buy Second Helping, Pron Lynyrd Skynyrd, or one of the complete collections CD's which contains the many fine works from this great southern rock and roll jam band.
B000001FMC|5.0|This album never ceases to entertain me. SOS here is Basia, Berlin, and the Pet Shop Boys all mixed together to create their cool unique sound. It has that 80s synth sound to it, but on the other hand, it has a jazzy sound as well.  Corinne's young British accent is also really pronounced on this album that one can't help but sing along in the same manner :D<BR>Classic songs such as &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Twilight World&quot; will take you back to some of your good old days. But the best ones are &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;Blue Mood&quot;, and &quot;It's Not Enough&quot; (she really sounds like Basia on this one). You might want to skip the remixes at the end. Some of them do the original songs no justice. But for a debut album, I think they did a real nice job.
0385507755|4.0|Although I did not especially like Frey's writing style, I suspect it reflected his frame of mind during his treatment at Hazelden. The content, as harrowing as it was, kept me interested enough to read the entire book in about 36 hours. Others have mentioned Junky, Naked Lunch, and other drug memoirs as being better; I always felt that those were, for all of their explicitness, glamourizing the junkie lifestyle. There is no glamour in Frey's addiction, he hit rock bottom and was fortunate enough to have had family and friends who had not given up on him. Reading this gave me a perspective into the life of the addict I had never known before. Frey made no excuses for his behavior, although those around him attempted to come up with reasons why he was an Addict (genetics, suspected history of abuse). AA isn't for everyone, and this is an excellent memoir of someone who succeeded without the major tenets of the group.
B00005JM09|5.0|Terminator 3 follows in its predecessor T2 in terms of being faithful to plot and awe-inspiring special effects. T3 mixes a bit of comedy, drama, and action into one shining performance that will leave you breathless. The new female TX Terminator, designed to terminate other terminators (Kristanna Loken) fits the perfect roll as a sexy, juggernaut, near unstoppable killing machine; her mission: terminate John Connor (Nick Stahl) his future wife (Claire Danes) and his Lieutenants. Arnold, like always flawlessly portrays the terminator, looks great, and is well built (considering he is now 55). If you want an epic action film, that has a perfect cast, with an evolving suspenseful plot- T3 is a must see film of the summer!
B00006J3WH|5.0|It's almost as good as watching the show again.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Everyone is gonna try and throw together about 7 or so bands to describe this band but the bottom line is that this is The Mars Volta and it is extremely creative intense emotional rock. They combine a thousand elements when other bands are just trying to [imitate] the popular guy for a hit single. I would love to hear these guys on the radio just to see the looks on people's faces... \\"wait, what is this, good music?\\". But seriously the only thing better than this album is thier live show. They react to thier music how everyone should be reacting to thier music instead of just standing there and throwing down a few heavy riffs, with some soft parts to spice it up. This is the most incredible genre breaking album i've heard and i hope that it sets an example for all hard rock bands to come.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I don't buy to many CD's but this one I gladly purchased after seeing the film. It has to be the best music I have heard in many years. You will be definitly satisfied.
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" is simply breathtaking.  I was NOT a fan of \\"virginal\\" Christina, and i was DEFINATELY not a fan of \\"Dirrty\\" Christina.  My friend bought me the CD the day it came out ad made me listen to it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  From the female power anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" to the positive and fun \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\" the entire record is fantastic.<br />Personally, some of my favorites are<br />Infatuation<BR>Cruz<BR>Soar<BR>The Voice Within<br />I highly recommend purchasing this cd.
B000002J1S|5.0|First picked up this Album in the early 80's; I was disappointed by the two-album set.  I found only the title track and THE CARPET CRAWLERS of any interest. I always loved \\"SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND\\" and was mad I never got to see Genesis with Peter Gabriel. My mistake I didn't sit down and really listen to this CD, it is there best. I take the story line with a grain of salt, at times you seem to understand what's going on, other times its makes no sense. The Music is on this album is such a high level, few musical groups will ever achieve. Collins drumming is the engine of the whole thing; the music changes time, and from ballads to hard rocking he never misses a beat. Gabriel's voice just sucks you in; he sings every note like he means it. The rest of the group plays equally as well; we have Genesis on top of their game. Don't be discouraged if it takes 20 years to digest, if you give it some time this will be one of you favorite cd's.
B000099T2L|5.0|...  Being a huge fan of Destiny's Child, and Kelly & Michelle's solo albums.  I bought it!  I had downloaded a few songs, and was extremely impressed.  But, WOW!  This CD is filled with 15 (one hidden track, \\"Daddy\\") incredible songs that range from flat out pop (\\"That's How You Like It\\" featuring Jay-Z) to sultry and sexy R&B/Soul (\\"Signs\\" featuring Missy Elliott, \\"Speechless,\\" and the ultra irresistable \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" featuring Luther Vandross.)  This album is purely a work of art.  ...  If you're still undecided after readin multiple reviews, ....  I might get in trouble for saying that, but oh well.  It really is an amazing album and I highly suggest you buy it.  BYE!
B00007JVBI|2.0|I was fortunate enough to see Cat Power in Florence, Italy, this year, in an abandoned train station-turned-installation art space. Let me just say that the high point of the concert was the location, followed by the onstage insanity displayed by the lead singer, distantly followed by the music. The music on You are Free is pretty enough, if not particularly innovative or even interesting, but if you take two second to listen to the lyrics (or read the liner notes) the banality is just nauseating.
B00005JL96|5.0|First off, i'd like to dismiss all the people on here who worry about there kids, yes lilo does jump and hit a girl, but the girl disrespected her, there is a little bit of violence, but this is a PG film, it isn't G \\"Thank God\\" the violence is al taken with a grain of salt, I for one am glad it isn't PC , Disney everything is magic, because the real world is not magic, it is real, yes lilo could be taking from the Department of Child Services, without giving away to much she has lost her parents, her sister takes care of her, and no one understands her, she doesn't clique with anybody, she is a very talented, very intresting young girl, but no one cares, so yes, she's a little bitter, realistic, who hassn't dealt with that? there is a great story arc, about \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" This is without a doubt, a movie about finding yourself, about family, and about alienation(lol.) <BR>pun intended. I took this as a joke at first, never rented it, never bought it, someone was right when they said dont judge a book by it's cover, a girlfriend lent it to me, by the way I am 24 Years old, I LOVE animation, and the colors, the atmosphere, the enviroments, the music, the hawaii setting, the realism, the family and personal messages, this movie is a GEM, this'll be rare someday, because alot of..i'd like to call RIDICOLOUS parents, think there kids should nevr see anything aside from smiles, lollipops, and talking horses..I for one HATED spirit..this film is for anyone, kids, adults, teens, young adults, I challange you to rent this movie, with an open mind, and get sucked into the story it is NOT a comedy, it is a CREATIVE DISNEY DRAMA, there is humor yes, but it's all very realistic, although there is no proof of aliens, there is also no proof of god, or ghosts, people fear that which they do not understand, and fear causes anger, anger causes hate, and hate leads to the dark side ;) hah, always wanted to use that..i'll be honest, i'm not a very large fan of regular films, I love animation, the way it shows emotion, and enviroments, it's amazing, Spirited away, is godlike, as is miyazaki, I guarantee he would love this film, CUDOS to Disney, for taking risks, the voice work is exceptional, and chihiro from spirited away, is the voice of LiLo, Truly, I cannot recomend this Masterpiece of Animation, Enough, This is one of my top favorite \\"FILMS\\" of all time, forget about it's animated..This is beautifull animation, Buy this movie, and enjoy it, and if you feel it is a lil, harsh, remember life is to, and your kids should learn that, that's the best lesson in life, reality.
B000001Y42|3.0|This album, now a rap-rock classic in the sense that it really was a milestone for the style and period, proves to be a somewhat rocky ride six years after its release.  While persistant anti-anything-that's-popular underground elitists will never stop insulting and putting down this record, the careful and attentive listener will clear their mind of preconceived expectations and in doing so, will discover that the instrumentalists present here not only are quite competent both technically and compositionally, but the wear their influences well.  Check out &quot;Stalemate&quot; for some subtle yet tricky drum licks played against a flowingly melodic guitar line.  The previous track, &quot;Sour,&quot; boasts a few not-so-simple licks that aren't immediately obvious to the ear as well.  &quot;Indigo Flow&quot; does what the title says and in fact is a rather soothing tune up until the loud, brash guitar kicks in.  <br />Despites its up points, many of the louder guitar-driven sections never become more than just noise.  &quot;Pollution&quot; harnesses the anger in its lyrics pretty well but the dirty distortion in the guitars does drag it down.  One of the few spots on the album where the grating guitars do work favorably is the track &quot;Nobody Loves Me.&quot;  <br />The rhythm section of Limp Bizkit is its saving grace; as Wes, Sam and company pound away with hidden skill while Fred Durst whines, screams, rhymes and ninnies his way around the beats and basically takes his backup band for granted.  Who knows what could have happened had Limp Bizkit continued moving in the direction they display here?
B00008J2DQ|5.0|For those who already like/love the band,this is a must,just stop reading and buy it.For those who don't know the group or didn't like them.This cd will change you mind.The drums are heavy and sulley is better.So check them out,it is not a waste of time.
0767827791|5.0|Wonderful. Not because of the fun it was watching it. Or the romance on screen. But because of it's supporting of the fabulous 50's era. Classic movie making at its best!
B000002UAR|5.0|Simply stated...Revolver is the Beatles greatest accomplishment.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce did her thang on this CD..from beginning to end. I can't stop listening to it. I would like to see her REMAIN a solo artist.. I NEVER purchased a Destiny's Child CD. It wasn't that I didn't like the music--it was catchy w/nice beats and hooks, but I always feared I wouldn't enjoy the rest of the music (too teen boppy like).. But it was different with B's joint.. Once I heard Crazy in Love.. I knew the rest HAD TO CRANK (not to mention she teamed up with the greatest--HOVA. Anything he touches turns to platinum). I'm impressed. If you ain't got it...GET IT!
0784011176|5.0|I never cry at movies, and in general, I nearly ever cry at all, but this movie set of a set of emotions that had me in tears at one point and angry at one character or another enough to rip my television apart with my bear hands. This movie is sad, enraging, happy, and yet in the end, dispite my expelling of emotion, I still felt although I could've gotten more out of the film. This movie was amazing and I would recommend this to anyone who would enjoy something that has drama, a bit of romance (in the sexual sense- not something to show the children...), and one of those 'overcomming odds' qualities.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Just when i was about to tie the noose around my neck i was informed that The Mars Volta's cd was coming out.  That information not only saved my life it also saved the lives of everybody who listens to Music.  TMV newest release is fresh and leaves an impression in your mind.  I don't know if its Omar's guitar or Cedric's voice.........or just the whole damn band.  They seem to be destined to meet.  The sounds complement each other so well.  The eriee <<<<(spelling) wails of Cedric Bixler Zavala with the ambience of the rest of the band weaves a blanket of emotion.  If you don't believe me listen to \\"Eriatarka\\" or track 6 on Deloused in the Comatorium.  Its by far the best cd i have ever owned.  I Would recommend it to everyone.  If you are a language person, no worries.....i have yet to hear a curse word in the cd.  Its just music that way it should be done.  Bravo to THE MARS VOLTA.  And a great live show as well.  As i said before the cd is catchy.  not in a pop way.  It just sticks with you all day.  I would just like to thank the guys for challenging themselves and promoting the rational self-interest of the whole music community.  Its people like you that give me something to look forward to in life. THE MARS VOLTA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|It's an excellent mixture of hard undertones, light melodies, and a beatiful voice.  This is not the type of music I normally listen to.  I have learned though, to embrace this album because of its varied themes and musical elements.  Amy's strong, and at times haunting voice will send chills down the spine of anyone who listens to this album.  Tracks such as &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; and &quot;Haunted,&quot; show the true versatility this band has, in regards to story telling.  Their album will take anyone who listens to it to places in their minds they have yet to visit.  I highly recommend it.
B000000WA4|5.0|this is a wonderful album by my favourite band, the Pumpkins. it's probably the most famous one, too. even if you aren't a huge fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, this is a great addition to your collection of true rock and roll. it's got your hard rock, soft rock, and the occasional slow songs that are really pretty. plus, it's 2 disks long, so you can enjoy it even more! :D :D great album. buy it!!
B000002BHE|5.0|In 1993, Celine Dion hit the big time with her album The Colour Of My Love. The album featured the massive breakthrough No.1 hit The Power Of Love, and the huge UK No.1 single Think Twice, which sold more than 1 million copies and spent a staggering 31 weeks on the chart. Expectations were high for Celine's follow-up album. Released in the spring of 1996, Falling Into You did not disappoint. The album has sold near to 30 million copies worldwide, and features some of the biggest songs of that particular decade. Celine Dion was now an international superstar, whose incredible vocal talents stunned the world. In comparison to her previous album, Falling Into You is somewhat more uptempo and joyous. The songs have more of a melody, and this works well for Celine.<br /><br />Falling Into You opens with the fabulous hit single, \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now.\\". The song peaked at No.3 in the UK in October 1996, and is one of Celine's most memorable compositions. The song runs for almost eight minutes, but it doesn't seem that long because once this powerful ballad gets going, you just fall back and enjoy every moment of it. \\"Because You Loved Me\\" was another big US No.1 for Celine in June 1996, while it peaked at No.5 in the UK. The song is the theme from the film Up Close And Personal, and it is literally perfect. The lyrical arrangements are beautifully crafted, and Celine's vocals are gorgeous - truly the voice of an angel. \\"Falling Into You,\\" the album's title track, is another superb song. This mid-tempo classic has a soft touch to it, and a feeling of ambiguity and mysticism as it opens with African drums. The song simply sways with simplicity, and Celine's vocals are awesome once more. The song rises and falls in the middle when Celine sings, \\"Catch me, don't let me drop. Love me, don't ever stop.\\" We are then treated to a sensual saxophone which really spices things up. Excellent. \\"Make You Happy\\" is perhaps the best up-tempo song on the album. Celine sings about making her lover happy in this happy pop number. All these silly pop bands that crave attention in today's music terms should take a listen to this - it's truly pop perfection.<br /><br />\\"Seduces Me\\" is a staggering love ballad. Celine performs this classy song to her optimum best with vocal supremacy when she sings, \\"And if I should die tomorrow, I'd go down with a smile on my face.\\" Great lyrics, even if she doesn't write them herself. \\"All By Myself\\" is...well, wow. This cover-version really does need no introduction. Celine sings for three minutes in a rather subdued tone about how she hates being all alone. Then the song rises, and Celine belts the song out from the bottom of her heart, practically smashing your CD speakers. Her voice is absolutely amazing, and I don't think I've ever heard anything so god-damn wonderful before in my life! Classic ballad. \\"Declaration Of Love\\" is another great pop song. This has a sort of old pop sound to it. It sounds very vintage with its (rather) corny vocal arrangements, but this is Celine Dion we're talking about and she can pull anything off. Celine's cover of \\"(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman\\" is not quite as good as the original, but her vocals rival even those of Aretha, not quite pulling it off, but very close. \\"Dreamin' Of You\\" is definitely an album highlight. This is pure pop personified, but Celine does it so well. The music is so relaxing and chilled out, and the backing singers highlight this. The verses are co-ordinated well, and Celine's vocals are rather average. This isn't a bad thing, however, as this is the kind of song that one desires to relax to - not to be distracted by epic vocals.<br /><br />\\"I Love You\\" is a great mid-tempo song. The song is more of a ballad, but it contains so many different musical styles that it makes it hard to decipher. Whatever it is, you're sure to love this wonderful love song. \\"If That's What It Takes\\" is not a very good song. This is basically a filler, but Celine's vocals save it from being terrible. \\"I Don't Know\\" is a spine-tingling chiller of a rock ballad. Celine's vocals echo, and you get the impression that she's singing it as she stands on the top of a mountain with the world at her feet. A saxophone and an electric guitar enhance the epic feel of this song. Definite highlight. \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" is a good cover-version of Tina Turner's classic. This version is not as good, and Celine seems to try desperately to beat Tina in the vocal stakes. Besides this, the song has a modern feel to it, which is rather interesting. \\"Your Light\\" is a great pop song. This song is sung in a sort of country style, in which Celine's vocals seem forced to sounds traditionally American. Not bad, but not an album highlight. This album closes with \\"Call The Man\\" and \\"Fly.\\" The former was the fifth and final single to  released from the album in the UK, and it's not really one of my favourites. A bit too slow and moody. The latter is a short and sweet diamond in which Celine's vocals stay low and in a whispering tone. The song is about Celine's close relative, Karine, who died of Cystic Fibrosis.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Falling Into You is a definite highlight album of the 1990's, and one of the biggest selling! There are only a few female albums of the 1990's that top Falling Into You in terms of sales, and these are Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill,\\" Whitney Houston's \\"The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack,\\" Celine's own \\"Let's Talk About Love\\" and Shania Twain's mammoth \\"Come On Over.\\" It's quite an achievement when thinking of what Celine Dion has achieved in the past decade. She is a 150-million-selling, Grammy-award winning international superstar, with the talent, the family, the wealth and the looks to add to this. She is truly one in a million, and Falling Into You is essential for all fans of ballads, and even just for those who are interested in very good music.being terrible. \\"I Don't Know\\" is a spine-tingling chiller of a rock ballad.

0736041850|5.0|If a picture is worth a thousand words this book is worth dozens of other books. The graphics are amazing both in detail and clarity. It details all the muscle groups (colour coded)then for each routine it highlights those muscles targetted as well as the surrounding tissue. Joints and bones are not neglected either. Sidebars give details as to how different muscles work. The instructions that accompany the exercises are clear and precise. They offer alternatives and warnings where appropriate.<br />Have a guess at how many different sections there are to the pecs that can be worked individually....this book will show you about a dozen and the ways to specifically target them. It is a book that you will constantly refer to. For example, I was doing front raises for shoulder work. These only work the 2/3 of the deltoids. From this excellent book I discovered that by doing one-dumbell front raises I could work all the deltoids as well as the upper pecs.<br />This is a book for beginners as well as experienced weight trainers. It won't give you a training programme but it will compliment your existing programme and allow you to make it more specific, efficient and interesting.<br />I've shown my copy to many friends. Invariably they quickly get their own.
B00008PRR9|5.0|If you share my love for The Who--but also my skeptical nature, you're likely growing a bit leery with the continuous re-repackaging and re-reissuing of the band's catalog, particularly after the deluxe &quot;My Generation&quot; came up so agonizingly shy of its potential.  Please allow me, then, to calm any misgivings you have about this issue of The Who's wonderful sophomore album, by assuring you that THIS is the one we've been waiting for.  Outside of Roger's &quot;See My Way' all the album tracks are in true, crisp stereo--and as many are also remixed, the sound quality far exceeds that of any past editions.  The wide, crystal stereo mix of the mini-opera &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; knocks me out, completely disgracing the old US stereo mix.  &quot;Run, Run, Run&quot; goes on about ten seconds longer at the end than we'd before heard, and there's a vocal on the closing chord of &quot;So Sad About Us&quot; which never appeared on any previous mix of the track.  Also, &quot;Heatwave,&quot; &quot;Don't Look Away&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; (John's flirtation with insanity), previously only available in true stereo on German and Japanese vinyl, are all here.  Standouts amongst the bonus tracks are fresh remixes of &quot;Bucket T&quot; and &quot;Barbara Ann,&quot; which bring the vocals to greater prominence (and a degree of stereo) than did the old EP mono mixes.  Of course, perfection is perpetually elusive--and keeping with that time-honored tradition, there are two minor flaws you should beware of.  The inferior old stereo mix of &quot;Disguises&quot; appears here, which succeeds in badly muffling many of the sounds which made this such a progressive recording for its time.  Also, John's &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; appears in a pretty poor electronically-reprocessed form--for whatever reason.  Both these cuts can be found in their superior mono forms on the 1995 version of this album, as well as the now out-of-print, collectible Polydor &quot;Back To Back Rarities&quot; cd (no, mine is NOT for sale!)  I do agree with the previous reviewer's assertion that the single version of &quot;Happy Jack&quot; could have been included here--after all, its UK B-side, John's &quot;I've Been Away,&quot; is here.  (A similar case could be made for including &quot;I'm A Boy&quot; and &quot;Pictures Of Lily.&quot;)  All of this aside, however: Even for the import price, I believe you'll find it well worth your while to purchase this 2003 version of &quot;A Quick One.&quot;  Particularly concerning the original LP's material, these tracks has never, ever sounded better--and likely never will.  Highly recommended!
055357342X|5.0|It's all been said in other reviews here, but I'll just repeat from my own experience: No fantasy has gripped me by the gut, surprised me, left me crying or shouting aloud in triumph like this series, and especially this book. The best characters ever created live in Martin's mind, and come to life on his pages. Could Tyrion's story possibly be better? <br />Tired of reading about the details of carpet patterns, silk blouse descriptions which take 2 pages, and hearing about whose eyes are more fierce looking for the 2185984th time from RJ? Grab a game of thrones and get ready to be immersed by a REAL writer who gives a damn about his work.  This series is so obviously a labor of love, enjoy what he has created!
0156027321|2.0|After reading this book, I just shook my head. What is all the fuss about?  How did this get a Booker Award? What are these reviewers so impressed with?  The main character of the novel? Absolutely uninteresting and uninvolving; nothing really human about him. Is it the 150 pages of seagoing adventures with Richard Parker (or did it just seem that long)?  Who cares? Do I really need the details about making a zebra your lunch?   After awhile, I just got tired of it; Richard Parker should have made a Pi sandwich and ended it all right there, as far as I'm concerned.  Is it the spiritual insights that supposedly flow from this story?  Give me a break--if this is a profound statement about faith, then I'm Moses.  It's strictly PBS pop philosophy.  Am I supposed to be impressed with Martel's &quot;fantasy island&quot;?  About as fascinating as a million meerkats. Some readers think this book is hilarious--all Martel does is throw out flashy but insubstantial wisecracks and one-liners.  This was chosen as the &quot;campus book&quot; where I teach. It just goes to show how desolate the literary landscape has become.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'm not gonna sit here and punk on India Arie.  She has way more going for her than 90% of her competition: beautiful voice, sensitive delivery, and mad skills as a songwriter.  She crafts complex and mysterious melodies that are often quite intentionally reminiscent of Stevie Wonder.  Nor can I really rip on her lyricism - really.  It's not that there's anything wrong with it; it's just occasionally a little...trite.  There, I said it, now go ahead and vote my review \\"unhelpful.\\"  But I mean, \\"Strength, Courage, & Wisdom, it's inside of me, oh yeah.\\"  Oh yeah, it's also on my T-shirt and coffee mug.  Not even Lauryn Hill was this Oprah-Book-Club.  Also, Erykah Badu called - something about wanting her wardrobe back, I didn't catch it all.  Now I'm just being a jerk, but it's actually instructive to compare India lyrically with Lauryn or Erykah or Me'Shell or that genius among poets, Jill; it emphasizes what I'm talking about.  Lauryn's edge was hip-hop, and she was a master wordsmith before she decided she needed to do pennance for being famous.  Erykah has always been a little lyrically quirky and quaint and qabalistic.  Me'Shell has the socially conscious bisexual silver tongue, and Jill - what do I need to say about Jill.  India by comparison writes greeting cards.  Beautiful, complex, mysterious greeting cards, I'll grant you.  <br />I DID give her 5 stars.  My complaint is not a significant one.  I just like my artists a little messed up and off-center and gritty, and India is as clean as the airbrushing on her album cover.  Nonetheless - an amazing effort, worth a listen even if you get the urge to have flavored coffee with your mom.

0142004235|4.0|Of all his novels, Steinbeck seems to pour the power of his immense skills into this one. It's as if he needs to prove to himself that he is worthy of all the accolades heaped upon him. Yet there is an ingredient that seems to be missing in this work when laid beside his many other achievements. In Grapes Of Wrath and Of Mice And Men, Steinbeck never labored, never faltered as the characters and story lines developed into crescendoes of drama and excitement. In East Of Eden, the characters are developed slowly, deliberately; the pace is tempered to accomodate the author's labored struggle to go beyond his talent and yet, the reader is treated to a third demension, beyond character, beyond story, to that of the author who seems to be saying...&quot;I will not rest until I have given you my best.&quot; Steinbeck proves to us he is afterall, only human; but only after he gives us this super human effort. While East Of Eden may not have been his best novel, it was by far his best work.
B00005JM09|3.0|No Linda Hamilton nor any direction from James Cameron, a different actor playing a grown-up John Connor and very little of the classic Terminator 2 music.  Still Terminator 3 has its fair share of funny Arnold one-liners, high-adrenaline action scenes, and lethal kills.  This movie though didn't discuss the aspects of machines trying to understand humans like the second, nor a new character- Kathy Brewster, trying to fathom a merciless killing machine, as in the first one.  I didn't like how the characters didn't get developed enough.  The whole crisis with Skynet taking over wasn't covered enough in detail.  I thought their could have been more explanation about how the government found out about Cyberdine Systems revolutionary technology after Dysler (I think that was his name) died in T2.  Still, nothing is better than watching thousands of bullets hit Schwartzenegger as if they were paper clips, and those multi-million $$ truck chase scenes are worth the price.  The TX was a dumb blonde killing machine, not impressive for something more sophisticated than the intelligent T-1000.  Still, I couldnt stop laughing during the two terminators battle in the bathroom or the end double helicopter crash scene.  Also, look for an outrageous cameo by the never-getting it Dr. Silberman.  <BR>And a definite sequel in a few years.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|The best part about Say You Will is that it is completely different than what you would have expected it to be.  The cd starts out with &quot;What's The World Coming To&quot; and you think that this is a nice little pop song and then bam... you are hit with &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; and it just gets better from there.  You have to give credit to Buckingham for doing a great job producing this one.    He knows just what to do with Stevie's songs and therefore created a wonderfully different CD.  Highlights are Illume, Thrown Down, Miranda, Say You Will, Come, Smile At You, Everybody Finds Out, Destiny Rules, Say Goodbye and Goodbye Baby. The Mac is back and they ROCK!!

B000001GXB|4.0|As a seventeen-year old piano student, I have always enjoyed Pollini's playing and thoroughly admired his technical and intellectual prowess. However, when one approaches the late Beethoven Sonatas, limiting an interpretation to these two factors will often leave the listener unsatisfied; one must also tap into the emotional realm. For example, the opening of Op. 110 is headed \\"cantabile\\" and \\"expressivo\\". Pollini plays the opening themes in such a straight-forward manner that if the listener weren't familiar with the piece, he would never suspect these markings. For me, Pollini is much more suited to the standard virtuoso repertoire (he plays pieces such as Stravinksy's Petrouchka or Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata phenomenally). For this reason, the Hammerklavier stands out as the highlight of this CD. Listening to him play the last movement of Op. 111 or either Arioso in the third movement of Op. 110 leaves me unmoved. Still, these recordings are legends in their own right, deservedly so. I do recommend them to any lover of the late Sonatas, but for a more enthralling experience, try Barenboim or Arrau. It simply isn't enough to just play the notes...
1400034779|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, The Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency, and couldn't wait to see what Precious Ramotswe was going to become involved in next!  I loved her direct approach to solving the &quot;mysteries&quot;.  She comes up with an idea, executes it, and solves the mystery with her innate sense of wisdom and common sense.<br />My question to others who have read this book, or to people who may be familiar with Botswana has to do with the titles used in the book.  Precious Ramotswe is referred to as Mma or Mme Mma, and later one of the male characters is referred to as Rra.  Does anyone know what those titles stand for?  The closest I can guess is Mme stands for Madame or Madamoiselle, but I can't figure out Mma, or Rra.  Please offer help it you are able.<br />Other than that, I recommend this book for light summer reading for those who enjoy mysteries or for those who don't.  The situations that Mma Ramotswe finds herself in are light enough for even the most squeamish.  Thoroughly enjoyable!
6305364648|5.0|...I recently reviewed this film looking for misogyny and possible ways out of it, as presented in the film. There's more reasons to think that Cameron is trying to argue with sexism than endorse it. If you accept the logic of this film, you WILL love women.<br />First the sexist reasoning. Almost all of Tom Arnold's jokes come at the expense of women. The commonest one being that screwing a woman is to screw her over. Jamie-Lee Curtis, Arnold's wife, spends much of the film being a damselle in distress. And when she fights out of her predicament it's in a cat-fight with Tia Carrere. She's also interested in an affair with an ambiguously sexed love interest. The guy she wants to have an affair with is a used car dealer who listens to the Bee Gees and likes boys' behinds. And then there's the minor footnote of the time Arnold rides a horse into an elevator with an elderly couple. The little old lady is disgusted, frumpish and silly, as even the horse is smart enough to see when it smacks her face with its tail. The little old man husband meanwhile thinks Arnold's horse is swell. Moral: men have longer adolescences than women.<br />The anti-sexist stuff is there too in direct response to the misogyny. JLC really does fight her way out of her trap. And when Arnold saves her, she grasps his arm as vigorously as he does her's. Arnold's daughter becomes the damselle in disress in the end. (SPOILER WARNING: SEE THE FILM BEFORE YOU READ FURTHER.) But she singlehandedly prevents Miami from being nuked. And at the close of the film Arnold has a great time clowning around with his wife and daughter.<br />Cameron is offering a thought experiment: What if all the utterly sexist thoughts which flit through young men's minds are true? What if women really are confused at best and silly at worst? What if their beauty is only skin deep? And what if their devotion can easily fray? Say all that is true. Can you still love them? The answer is one that any good New Age guru is going toaccept: you can because women are FUN.<br />(There's also a hint that the film is really a personal piece of art when the Arab terrorist directs himself in a video warning to the US.)<br />Please, Jim! Come back to action! No one else does it as good as you! Just treat us worker ants like we're the alpha males and we'll follow you every time!

B000002H70|5.0|PICTURES OF YOU is the most romantic song ever.<BR>FASCINATION STREET is the closest sensation to be drunk or to a trip.<BR>SAME DEEP WATER ... is one of the best transcriptions to music of loneliness ever done.<br />This album is full of sensations and colours. <BR>This music brings you to another world with a careful listen.<br />RS at a highlight of expression, not only of himself and his band but of modern music history so far.
B00006G8G1|4.0|The concert is excellent, the sound is superb.  The extras are a little frustating.<br />Maiden deserves a better production than this DVD ended up having, but still is one of the best Live DVDs around.<br />thumbs up!
B00009P1O2|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see Queen during \\"THE GAME\\" tour in 1980 and it was a show I'll never forget.  This Live at Wembley '86 reminded me of their legacy and it's one I've yet to remove from the tray. <br />The setlist is amazing and to think they could have performed  back-to-back shows as so many great songs DIDN'T make it to the stage for this tour.  Somebody To Love, You're My Best Friend, It's Late, Killer Queen, Brighton Rock, Keep Yourself Alive, Fat Bottom Girls, and so many others.  Still, it's a great show and the best music DVD I've purchased to date. Freddie and the boys put on a production that was unseen it's day.<br />My only negative comment (and the reason for only 4 stars****) is targeted toward the editing department and not the band.  Too many non-stop angle changes rather than allowing the viewer to focus on either the band or the individual performer.  That said, it still kicks. I also remind myself that this was recorded pre-DVD technology and the picture and sound are phenomenol.  I have a feeling the band may have had final say on this release.<br />Bonus DVD is well worth it.  Great interviews, unseen footage, slideshow and more.  It gives you the feeling the remaining members are sincere, true gentlemen who were and still are passionate about QUEEN.  There will never be another like it. BUY THIS DVD!!
B00005RYLE|5.0|What is cool about this special edition is that besides this great movie, you have cool extras, like the documentary by Bruce Campbell.<br />BCs commentaries during the movie are excellent too.
B00005JM09|5.0|I went and seen the sneak preview at the theatre tonight and I was totally amazed by what I saw. There was so much action and the sequences were astonishing! Arnold has never looked better! None stop action til the end, edge of your seat suspense, this was an awesome addition, no doubt a T4 is coming up next. Go and watch this sequel you will NOT be dissapointed.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I would highly recommend seeing the movie beforehand as the soundtrack reflects many of the events and emotions experienced in the film, which is a unique and beautiful blending of three  stories. I am first a fan of films, and secondly to the actual score. One may have a good film with incredible performances on the part of its actors, a killer script, but without a magnificent score to back it up, it may not live up to its full potential. This score not only allowed, but made The Hours become what it is (a theatrical success.) I am by no means familiar with Philip Glass, but having viewed the movie, I had to have the soundtrack. His music swells with emotion, includes crescendos and decrescendos in all the right places, and blends the string quartet with the piano so eloqiuntly, making one of the most beautiful soundtracks out there. The main theme stings throughout the 14 tracks, sewing it all together. Philip Glass is most certainly one of the best composers, and with this gorgeous collaboration, you can't go wrong.
B000002KHF|5.0|Even though there is a &quot;best of&quot; CD for Van, this one is my favorite. Crazy Love... Into the Mystic... wonderful. Can't get enough of listening to these songs.
B00005JLSE|5.0|First off, I've been one of this show's biggest fans since the '70's, but am not a huge fan of the \\"concert version\\" currently on Broadway. For years I've thought that this would be fun to see, but doubted that it could work since the only director that I've thought made this style of show translate was the late great Bob Fosse (CABARET). He, of course, was the driving force behind the original production. I just didn't think, even when they were talking the likes of Madonna, Rosie O'Donell (both would have been good, probably) that this theatrical style would work on film.<br />Imagine my surprise when Rob Marshall did the most shocking thing possible for a film director of a stage musical...he trusted the damn material!!! ***Gasp!!!** He didn't od the \\"let's open it up\\" or \\"lets simplify it like the revival\\" thing, but put the show onstage and it worked like gangbusters.<br />The cast is perfect. With all the compliments (deserved) that the 4 leads get, don't forget some of the other terrific performers John C. Reilley, Taye Diggs, and Christine Baransky (although I did miss having that great bit of having Mary Sunshine being exposed as a drag queen, but that wouldn't have translated. Plus that great cameo...VIVA CHITA RIVERA! What a great tip-o'-the hat to the original. <br />After the whetting of the appetite for musicals that this and MOULON ROUGE gave us, how about some more of the B'way greats undiscovered for some reason or another by the rest of the country...where's CITY OF ANGELS and ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY?

B0000039QA|5.0|This CD really makes you miss the ol' days when Biggie was king of the rap and hip hop world.  Every track makes you move and think about what BIG is really sayin.  My Fav. tracks are Notorious Thugs with Bone, Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, Hypnotize, and the 10 crack commandments.  If you miss BIG and is fire spittin lyrical style, I suggest you pick this up.

0688163173|3.0|The first 3/4 or more of this book were very good.  I was quite engrossed.  The ending is exceedingly weak -- to the point that I feel cheated.  Without revealing the nature of the ending, let's just say that it made the entire novel up that point completely meaningless.  I think Lehane took the easy way out.
B000069AUI|5.0|I didn't know Coldplay very well,before.Just one day,I heard the song&quot;In My Place&quot;in a CD shop,and I bought the Album&quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot;.That night,I played this CD again and again,and I almost listened to it all night.And now,it's still one of my favorite album.I also love their debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot;
B000059TEP|4.0|I first saw this movie when I was 14. It was very romantic and an interesting concept.  At that age, I couldn't really associate what &quot;true love&quot; was, so I wasn't very teary.  I watched it again later on, and I couldn't stop the water works.  It is truly a mixed-emotion movie -- full of sadness, happiness, and a bit of anger.  Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore really pull it off as acting &quot;in-love&quot;.  Whoopi Goldberg allowed some comic relief to enter the movie without spoiling the mood.  Good romance, just don't forget the tissues!
B000006NPY|5.0|If I could listen to only one Pumpkins' song ever again, I would choose crestfallen.  If only one album, than it would be this achingly dark, baking-choclate piece of composition.  Admittedly, it was my first Pumpkins album, but still, I name it my favorite.
B00005JKDR|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!  Monsters need to scare children and harness their screams to provide electricity for their town. Little &quot;Boo&quot; isn't scared and follows them into the monster world -- but children are not allowed in the world; they are contaminated!  When Sully and Mike learn that it's not really true, they make some good changes to the factory.  I'm not telling what they are though!<br />This film is full of adventure and humor and is great for adults and children alike!
B000005RXF|5.0|Please, my friends, don't heed the hype and don't listen to the band.  POP is brilliant, painful, powerful, angry, angsty, and more heartbreakingly human than any U2 album since Boy.  They've come down off their pillar of just-short-of-godly genius to roll in the mire with us mere mortals.  It hurts, but in a good way.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Not radioheads best but who cares.  Like the last two it's not imeadiately accesible but after a few listenings I love it.
0684808323|4.0|I had to read the book after seeing the movie by the same name.  It's interesting and well-written.  Being a recreational gambler, I most enjoyed a statement from the author that went something like:  &quot;a casino is a financial institution specifically designed to separate a gambler from his money.&quot;  So true.
B00005K9LN|5.0|BRITISH STEEL was the first Priest album I ever bought (back in '80). I was hooked! I had never heard songs like these! The glass-shattering vocals of Rob Halford! The twin guitar savagery of Tipton & Downing! The cool bass intro on THE RAGE! I listened to it daily, over and over. It drove my girlfriend absolutely nuts! She hated every song, especially GRINDER and RAPID FIRE. She called them \\"retarded\\", and me \\"immature\\" for listening to them. I ignored her, of course. I loved BRITISH STEEL! Still do! Every tune is a classic. There are no duds. After memorizing the whole bloody album, I went out and bought Priest's entire catalog! The rest is history. My girlfriend is long gone, but Priest lives on...
B000009MF7|2.0|While Gramophone did award this CD, the performance of the G major concerto (heralded as one of the great accomplishments on this album) is a great disappointment. The first movement is a good example: many of the woodwind solos following the introduction are simply out of tune, and Zimmerman's sudden increase in tempo in the recap begs for slowing--- it pains to hear such speed for the orchestra. Thankfully, the infamous bassoon and horns solos are beautifully played and bear none of the same problems. The second movement is wonderfully executed, (though a little lifeless in the strings) but the ending is oddly out of rhythm, probably the result of a strange ritardando. It is the third movement, however, that really disappoints. For starters, if one listens to the beginning and ending of the track (noting the last and first few measures are nearly identical music), an exponential increase in tempo occurs. Although this movement has been referred to as \\"the chase,\\" it is taken to an uncontrollable extreme here. The French horn duet early in the movement is too brash and forward (as are many brass entrances throughout), and there is a clarinet run that fails rhythmically, giving some hint of how Cleveland struggled under Zimmerman's wild tempi. The duet bassoon runs (a famous orchestral audition excerpt) take on a tempo all their own when they start (much slower). The piano playing throughout is flawless, but one wonders if Zimmerman could not heed more to the orchestra in order to make controlled, flowing music. The fluctuating tempi are hard to miss, and lead to a disappointingly fast and sometimes unmusical rendition of benchmark 20th century music. As for the Left Hand and the Valses, they are in much better shape and worth the purchase, especially the former. More control, musicality, and an orchestra with an unbeatable sound (in the case of the G Major Concerto) can be found in Alicia de Larrocha and St. Louis under Leonard Slatkin, with the piano version of the Valses being a special (and more musical) treat.
0446608955|5.0|Having known Jamie Sullivan his whole life, Landon never saw her as anything more than the Reverend's daughter and a devout Christian who never left home without her Bible.  Her father, always fun to joke about-practiclly asked for it, he was always preaching about 'the fornicators' in his sermons... Such was the way of things until Landon finds himself stuck in the postion of needing a favor from Jamie, and in the end returning one to her. The more he gets to know her, the more he grows up and realizes that despite his mostly good intentions, the only half-decent person he was just wasn't enough.  Not only does Jamie teach Landon about sincerity and truth, she opens his eyes to the the many sides of love and the miracles that occur because of them.    <BR>In A WALK TO REMEMBER, Nicholas Sparks writes a pretty confident statement about his story: first it will make you laugh, and then cry.  He couldn't have been more on the money. You have to admit a novel that can do both is quite a powerful one.
B0000256VK|5.0|As most everyone else, I had only heard &quot;Avalon&quot; and &quot;More Than This&quot; previously, when I bought the album. However, putting on my headphones and doing things around the house, I ended up just stopping in my tracks and really listening. Perhaps I am a romantic at heart...just one more thing I have in common with our crooning hero of Roxy Music.<BR>Personally, &quot;More Than This&quot; isn't a fave song of mine on here. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it though. Then &quot;The Space Between&quot;, a funky departure consisting of Bryan begging his love to &quot;close up the space between us&quot;. After that, is the song we all love, &quot;Avalon&quot;. Sensual, and the background vocals from Yanick Etienne are amazing (I know I can't hit those notes!) &quot;India&quot; is an interesting instrumental, soaring synths, and some guitar work partly made by Ferry. &quot;While my Heart is Still Beating&quot; is a dreamy observation of the world, and somewhat hard to describe. &quot;The Main Thing&quot; is one of my fave songs on here. Seeming sort of like a march at first, that's only the drums marking out the driving rhythm. Bryan, in the meantime, is talking to his partner and what she does to him...&quot;everybody knows when a good thing's gone/you can really turn me on&quot;. &quot;Take a Chance with Me&quot; is a gorgeous statement of what a love song really should be, especially potent in today's world of high school dances where a &quot;boy band&quot; tune is the class song (which was my case this year.) Next up is &quot;To Turn You On&quot; (which seems to be a much-used phrase on this entire album). Both a declaration of devotion and dreaminess, Bryan Ferry seems to have momentarily dropped the usually-bored pose and opted for the always-willing-to-please lover persona. Then &quot;True to Life&quot;. Quite an amazing song, guitars and synths seem to be the main ingredients instrumentally, and once again, somewhat hard to describe. Lastly, the pretty instrumental &quot;Tara&quot; (which too seems to be a recurring name...i.e. the ending of &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;). A long oboe solo from Andy Mackay, and ocean waves washing up, as well as the beautiful keyboard music. A gorgeous ending to a fantastic album. <BR>I do agree, that this album alone was majorly responsible for the synth bands and a lot of the new romanticism of the '80s. ESPECIALLY Duran Duran (and I should know, I have all THEIR albums). Many songs on here remind me of songs on Duran's &quot;Rio&quot; (which, coincidentally though, came out the same year.) Though you can never beat the originals, and Avalon is proof.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|Ok, I know I'm picky, you'd think a cd of 27 number one beatles songs would make me run out and buy it. I did eventually buy it but I found that for a real true beatles fan this cd really wasn't what I was looking for. I think that with the beatles we all have our favorite songs, and for me they were the ones that weren't the number one hits. I happen to have all their albums now. I've discovered songs that I haven't heard for years and I wouldn't have heard them if I bought this cd. These are great songs here, but I think a larger selection is definately needed to do the Beatles justice. I've downloaded all my beatles cd's. There are very few songs I don't like. If you want a more comprehensive general overview cd series i would choose the red and blue greatest hit albums, one is up to 1966 and the other is up to their breakup. And go and download these albums if you can or get some used copies. To anyone just starting to listen to the Beatles, go out and buy revolver, Hard Days night and Abbey road. There you go, something to get people started. I think anyone making a Beatles greatest hits album is going to have problems with me because I'm so hard to please. I just don't think a #1 hits album is what's needed. I think maybe a four disc or five disc set would work but you might as well get all the albums anyways, you'll find 5-6 songs on each one you want to be your favorite.
B00006HBUC|1.0|I'm a huge SD fan,and I love the new series(What's New Scooby Doo?).But this...is just trash.\\"Did you see Scooby Doo it is great and the part when yak yak yak yak yak see it it's funny hahahahahah\\"....i've heard that from everyone at my school.So I decided to see it.Ok,let me explain it to you.Scooby and the Mystery Inc,after solving a mystery,all leave the group.A few years later they all go to a theme park to see what's wrong with a group of kids.You know what's wrong?They're souls have been stolen..... by Scrappy Doo.Why did he suddenly become evil?How come he tried to kill \\"Uncle Scooby\\"?It's confusing and just plain horrible.<br />My Opinion:The actors were horrible(Freddie Prinze Jr?Come on!),Scooby was some sort of animated piece of poo,and the humour was not funny.\\"Ohmygosh did you see when this person did that oh that was hillarious hahahahhaah!\\".Unless you think farting is funny,you wouldn't like it.The songs were annoying and repetitive(Scooby Doo where are you scooby doo scooby doo where are you)and I don't have the soundtrack(or movie,for that matter).The only good thing about this is Matthew Lillard,who did a great job of doing Shaggy.Other then that,if you didn't see this in thearters,don't buy it.Or even rent this disgrace to the cartoon.
0385504209|2.0|It GREATLY disappoints me that the &quot;facts&quot; in this book are conjecture since that seems to be the only thing that is interesting about DaVinci's Code. Now I have no idea if I have truly learned anything new or if it is all fiction. The characters are thinly drawn and &quot;grinning&quot; in all the most inappropriate places.  The plot is fairly predictable.  If this is considered to be a GREAT read by mystery readers, I had better stick to literature.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I loved this movie, mostly because i am an irish catholic. I thought that Leo had a great irish accent and that the acting was incredible! My all time favorite movie.
B00005JM09|4.0|Just got back from the first showing and I am very happy I ignored all the people who said it was going to be horrible. The story isn't quite as good or as deep as the first two, but the ending was depressing in a cool way. Arnold delivers some of his funniest one-liners yet. Watch the \\"talk to the hand\\" scene towards the middle of the film and you will see what I mean. The TX played by Kristanna Loken is extremely hot and has a bunch of cool weapons to boot. The special effects are great and the crane chase scene is worth the ticket price alone. While not as revolutionary as the first two, T3: Rise of the Machines will surely entertain, and you will leave the theater thinking you watched an action film with a little more thinking envolved than your average summer blockbuster.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is one of those movies that really makes you think. After watching this my life didn't seem so bad after all. \\"Requiem for a dream\\" is one of the most moving and touching movies I have ever seen in my life, but I don't think I will be watching it again for a while. It's defenetley disturbing and I cried a lot during this movie, but I do think eveyone needs to see this. If I ever had any thoughts about doing drugs they quickly vanished after this movie.
0800177177|1.0|One of the worst movies on the subject ever made. A shocking script and terrible performances all round make this a laughable installation to the Dracula legend. Gary Oldman is at his usual over-acting worst, and Keanu Reeves is shocking as Jonathan Harker, effecting the worst English accent in the history of cinema. Winona Ryder bored my packet off; the exchanges between her and Reeves were sickening along with the rest of the script, Harker: We can be married when I return.<BR>Mina: Oh Jonathan.....Jonathan....Oh Jonathan.....<br />I'm sorry if I seem harsh, but please try and avoid this movie lest you like it. And of course we had to have a big American, with a big moustache and a big knife because obviously Mr Coppola thought our interest could not be aroused without an American charater. Balls, pure balls.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This is from tvguide.com:   \\"CHEERS to yet another opportunity to revisit the gang of Seinfeld. As if the ubiquitous reruns weren't enough - and they aren't - the sitcom is finally going to DVD. No word yet on a release date, but Jerry Seinfeld has said that he's working on such DVD extras as outtake reels and cast interviews. We'll be waiting. \\"<br />I can't wait for 9 different colored boxed sets (hopefully released back to back within a reasonable time frame).  And as for price? Simpsons are [less then the sopranos], ...  Cross our fingers for a 2003 release!!! My reruns on VHS are deteriorating fast from repeated viewing.<br />Best Seinfeld lines:<br />\\"Yama Hama, it's fright night\\"<BR>\\"I can't stop now\\" (George choking from a ciggarette)<BR>\\"Go to hell\\" - \\"Heard that one already\\"<BR>\\"If he needs me, tell him I'm IN MY OFFICE!\\"<BR>\\"Poor Lilly\\"<BR>\\"Someone's going home in a bodybag\\"
B00000099Y|5.0|I can't say much about this album other than it kicks bum and it's totally amazing. The songs (Like almost all of Tool's songs)are more like an audio experience/story being told as opposed to a cut and dry verse/chorus/verse formula. Maynard James Keenan is hands down my fav vocalist (Next to Mr. Robert Plant and Cedric Bixler, of course) and the overall instrumental work and effort is very good for heavy rock. Bottom line: Buy this album!
B00008OWZC|5.0|What else would you expect from the greatest band in the history of the known universe?<br />Pagey has done us proud with this stunning live 3 disc album which finally does justice to the mighty Zep. The track list is impressive and the versions are second to none.<br />Perhaps the strongest impression to come from listening to this masterwork is that Led Zeppelin were a true BAND. Not just one or two guys out front ego-tripping, but a cohesive four piece unit in which every member was totally essential to the overall output. Just as the Beatles could never have carried on if Ringo or George had passed away, the Zep boys knew that the loss of any one of them should mean the end of the band. That is to be respected.<br />If Led Zeppelin has a successor, it would have to be U2, in that there is nobody to touch them at this time (although on a creative level, I love The Mission UK.) Just as there was literally nobody to come even close to the magic that was Led Zeppelin.<br />Yes, this is as good as it gets.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is a really great movie, totally engrossing and entertaining. I can't recommend it enough. I will, however, acknowledge that it is probably not for all tastes; I just don't understand why people who didn't like it can't do the same. But no, the criticizers can almost never be content with trashing the movie/book/music that they are ostensibly reviewing. Instead they turn their wrath immediately from the subject at hand to those morons, like me, who actually enjoyed the work in question. It's strange....<br />But anyway, I think anyone who criticizes the MOVIE based on the depth of the philosophical content has missed the point entirely and has maybe taken the whole thing a little too seriously. I'm pretty sure Linklater didn't regard this project as his own personal effort to displace Aristotle in the western canon (heck, during the discussion of free will he has a character explicitly acknowledge that much of what is being discussed could be called sophomoric). <br />Waking Life is anything but didactic. It is, like Lynch's Mulholland Drive, a DREAM. And just as Mulholland Drive is a dream of and by (so to speak) Hollywood, Waking Life is a dream of and by ideas. And you can't (or at least in my opinion you shouldn't) judge a representation of a dream against what you think would be a proper representation of something else altogether.<br />One thing I would like to say in Linklater's defense: To suggest that NONE of the philosophical riffs in the film have any sort or academic merit is just plain obstinate. Many of the actors in the film are, in fact, academics, and 3 that I can think of off the top of my head are philosophy professors, who helped craft their monologues and presumably know at least a little (though, I grant you, by no means nearly as much) about the topics as our friendly Amazon critics.<br />In the criticizer's defense: It's true, Waking Life does not reveal the meaning of life or confirm the existence of God. Sorry if that ruins it for you....<BR> <BR>Well, I've said my peace, and in doing so I realize that I'm diving headlong into hypocrisy when I urge reviewers to, please, talk all you want about the movie/book/music in question, but leave us poor total strangers alone.
B000053VAZ|5.0|i love this movie. it's an classic to every extent of greatness.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Has there ever been a band in rock music with a name that's better than AUDIOSLAVE?  I don't think so.  I looove the name of this band!  <br />More importantly, I love the music on this album.  I bought Audioslave's debut after hearing only the hit, &quot;Like a Stone,&quot; which led me to believe this was a band with potential.  I did not know until later that this so-called &quot;supergroup&quot; consists of former members of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine - neither of which are bands I followed before.  The collaboration of Chris Cornell with the other members of RATM, however, has produced one of the better hard rock albums in recent memory.<br />This album reveals traces of early 70's hard rock, early 80's heavy metal, and early 90's grunge.  I enjoy the combination of these influences because it demonstrates the multi-faceted talents of the band.  This album includes several songs that are intelligent, both lyrically and musically, which is enticing to a listener like me who likes the music to MEAN something.  <br />Chris Cornell's expressive voice moves adeptly through the scope of mellow to intense bars of music.  Tom Morello and the rest of the band capably deliver through moments of explosive energy to tempered reflection.  I wasn't surprised to discover these guys were experienced performers in previously well-known bands because they have confidence and perform like veteran musicians.  <br />Beware of Led Zeppelin flashbacks as you hear the opening track, &quot;Cochise.&quot;  After that, you'll have an intense ride through powerhouse pieces such as &quot;Show Me How to Live,&quot; the fiery &quot;Gasoline,&quot; &quot;What You Are,&quot; and the explosive &quot;Set It Off.&quot;  For grunge fans, &quot;Shadow of the Sun&quot; starts soft and over the course of nearly six minutes builds into a climactic, screaming finale.  &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; is a thoughtful if not existential tune with potential to be a hit single.  One of my very favorite tracks is &quot;Exploder,&quot; with its funky groove, captivating lyrics, and dynamic performance.  Another standout is the bluesy, rhythmic &quot;Getaway Car,&quot; proven to be a pleaser.  Of course I can't forget &quot;Like A Stone,&quot; an enormously popular song (with good reason) that speaks for itself.  <br />All things considered, I'd give this album a five-star rating and recommend it to anyone who's looking for an injection of purely post-grunge hard rock.  Audioslave's heavy-hitting debut is about as good as it gets in this genre of today's music.
B00005YW4H|5.0|You probably heard \\"Don't Know Why\\". Well, be aware that the<br />whole cd is that tempo. Very good cd though!\\"One Flight Down\\" is<br />my favorite. Great cd! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!

B000084T18|5.0|One of the best cds that have been out since tupac in his prime. anyone disagree i doubt it
0553573403|5.0|I found myself getting drawn into this story more than any other fantasy saga yet.  The characters are not cookie cutter good and bad but of various shades in between.  Characters live and die with seemingly little fairness.<br />It is a story of various kingdoms under uneasy allegience to one king.  At his death, the kingdoms begin feuding for both control and freedom and the war begins.  There is also danger lurking in the wilderlands behind the wall that borders the kingdom and not enough protectors to fight.<br />This is a stunning beginning to a tale that draws you in and makes you want wish that you could guide them through their follies.  I highly recommend it to fastasy lovers.
B000099T2L|2.0|I was not impressed with Beyonce's c.d. I purchased her and Monica's at the same time, and Monica's c.d. gets alot more play in my car.  Lyrically, it is a sad c.d. A 5 year old could've written most of the songs.  She's a great performer, and the ballads are great, but overall, it's too \\"britney spears\\" for me.  Nice effort Beyonce.....Maybe the follow up will be better.
B000092ZYX|3.0|This is no OK Computer by far! I tend to skip more songs than I listen to. Maybe I need more structure in my music, but find this album a bit annoying. When they write a great song it is a great song, but when they go out there they are out there. Listen to it before you buy it.
0062502182|5.0|I absolutely love this book- I have read it at least seven times, and every time I get some new insight. After I'm done, I get this kind of 'spiritual high' and I feel centered and ready to confront the obstacles of my life. I've given this book to everyone I know, and they tell me the same thing- this book is amazing. Don't let those other reviews fool you. Pick it up- it will take you a handful of hours, and it will stay with you for the rest of your life.
B00008K78M|5.0|Laura is fantastic.Her voice really soars high.This is my favorite music dvd,I've watched it over and over just can't get enough of it.Even if you dont understand italian you will enjoy this great concert.
B000002HEM|4.0|Since we never got that &quot;Best of&quot; from them, I guess this will have to due. Of course, this is basically an unplugged greatest hits album. And as good as the studio albums are, this actually seems, and sounds, more natural for them. It includes the classics &quot;Like the Weather&quot;, &quot;Trouble Me&quot;, and &quot;These are Days&quot;. Other wonderful songs are &quot;What's the Matter Here?&quot; and &quot;Noah's Dove&quot;. The only songs that I really miss, are &quot;Dust Bowl&quot;, and &quot;Circle Dream&quot;. But you can't have it all. Though &quot;In My Tribe&quot;, &quot;Blind Man's Zoo&quot;, and &quot;Our Time In Eden&quot; are excellent studio albums, I would still suggest this to the person looking for just one &quot;10,000 Maniacs&quot; disc. It's 14 unplugged tracks that sound as good as &quot;Natalie Merchant&quot; looks.
0375414932|5.0|Gee the reviewers of this book are sparing in their praise. &quot;Quite affecting...&quot; and &quot;All is not wonderful...&quot; What's a poor novelist got to do to please these guys? This book is flat out perfect. I got lost in the story almost from page one and by the time I reached the end I really KNEW Logan Mountstuart. I cried at the end because I didn't want him to leave. His story gave so much and had so much more to give. See! I'm doing it to myself again... What really comes through in this brilliant novel is the courage of the author to have Mountstuart make some dramatically bad life decisions, yet he is still guided by a strong sense of integrity and truth. It makes you want to follow those same guiding principles in your own life. Only the greatest books make you think about how you live your life. This is such a book.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I'm more likely to listen to &quot;Henry Rollins&quot; than &quot;Phil Collins&quot;, but since I was in high school in the 80's, I can't help liking him. Yes, sometimes he's a little too pop and mushy, but his better songs make up for it. The hits &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, &quot;Easy Lover&quot;, and &quot;Seperate Lives&quot; are all here. Plus the great &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, and my favorite &quot;One More Night&quot;. His cover of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;True Colors&quot; isn't as good as hers, but still enjoyable. The only thing missing to me is &quot;Don't Forget My Number&quot;, (good thing I have that on vinyl). This should complement your &quot;Elton John&quot; and &quot;Sting&quot; cd's well.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All is in my opinion Metallica's peak which holds steady through the Black Album. I like all the songs on this album. This is a must have album if you remotely enjoy metal. The only complaint I have is there isn't much bass, or production quality isn't great. Hopefully, this CD will get remastered with more bass.
B000001EAQ|4.0|One thing is for certain, this is not &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. If you can get past that, you should come to love this as much as the rest. This and &quot;Zooropa&quot; were absolutely neccessary in &quot;U2's&quot; evolution, and I personnally wouldn't want to hear &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; repeated 4 times. A huge Lemon at the concerts, and Bono with a shaved head take a back-seat to the excellent music within. It does have more of a techno/disco vibe to it than their other albums, but not overwhelmingly so. And those who say this sounds rushed and unfinished, I think they say that because they hear other people say it. The songs &quot;Do you feel loved&quot; and &quot;If you wear that velvet dress&quot; are awesome, and &quot;Please&quot; really should have been on the &quot;Best of 1990-2000&quot;. Bottom line, is put this in your stereo, and let your speakers snap, crackle, and &quot;Pop&quot;.
B000002HMH|3.0|Metallica was trying new things in this Load/Reload era. Their booklet has some very strange pictures. but i did enjoy these songs: Until It Sleeps, King Nothing (very good song),Bleeding Me, Cure, Poor Twisted Me, Wasting My Hate, Mama Said (cool country Metallica song, one of my favorites on the CD), Thorn Within, and Ronnie.
B00000634J|5.0|It's just what it says it is, &quot;The Very Best of John Lennon&quot;. This is almost identical to &quot;The John Lennon Collection&quot; that came out in 1982, but tops it because it's one track longer, and includes the song &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot;. I can't think of anything missing besides &quot;Dear Yoko&quot;. No biggy. Anything on here you may not recognize is most likely as good as the rest. This includes the classics &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;, &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;, &quot;Instant Karma&quot;, and of course &quot;Imagine&quot;. One of my favorites is &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;. It has one of the all-time best lyrics, &quot;Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans&quot;. I have been a fan of his ever since my mother played his records while cutting my hair as a child. You might also want to check out his old band. They were pretty good too.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is one of my favorite Metallica albums. I like all the songs on the record to a degree. My favorites are: Master of Puppets, The Thing That Should Not Be, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Leper Messiah (good car accident song), and Orion. This is an essential Metallica CD.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the best pure war movie ever made. In terms of bringing combat to its viewers, Band of Brothers has little or no competition. The dirt, death and despair of real fighting are vividly portrayed in an aggressive but accurate manner. It covers the actions of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from their beginnings at Camp Toccoa, through western Europe and finally to victory over the Nazi regime. Historical detail was a key interest in the making of this ten part series. Many first hand accounts were used to support the on-screen drama. Some complained that the section involving E Company's seizure of Hitler's Aldershorst was inaccurate. It is true that E Company was not the first allied unit to occupy the Eagle's Nest. But this small discrepancy is one of a very few that I found in the film. So overall I rate its accuracy highly. If you want an engrossing, heroic and epic story about the allied triumph in World War Two, then Band of Brothers is your film.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's Black Album balances the best of Metallica musically and lyrically. This album seems too good to be true when you play it. Once you pick up this album you'll beat yourself over the head because you didn't discover it earlier. A+ Metallica! Songs to listen to: Enter Sandman (very fun to play and hear, one of the best songs of Metallica), Sad But True (one of my favorite Metallica songs for being very heavy with perfect lyrics and alot of soul), The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam (most interesting intro, into a song that blew my mind), Don't Tread On Me(should be a national anthem against terroism), Nothing Else Matters (great slow song, shows a unique side to Metallica), The God That Failed (Great bass intro), My Friend Of Misery (great songs to learn and play), The Struggle Within.
B00005JM09|5.0|Lots of Intense Action, Great Effects, Cool Story and Arnold looks as Great as Ever. Yes, this movie was not quite as good as The Terminator and T2 but it did not disappoint me at all. I have to admit, I did not think they could pull this off without Cameron but they did. The ending surprised me a bit but left the door open for T4, which I would love to see happen.
B00000FCBC|4.0|This is a great cover CD that shows us what Metallica liked before there was Metallica. Disc I best songs are: Free Speech For The Dumb, Turn The Page (better than the Bob Seger's original version), Die, Die My Darling (great song, at the beginning, it sounds like James burps its very funny you have to have it somewhat loud to hear it, but its worth it), Loverman (because its very funny), Mercyful Fate, Whiskey In The Jar, Tuesday's Gone and The More I See. Disc II: Helpless (sounds like it should have been a Kill 'Em All song), The Small Hours ( very cool inro and song as a whole), The Wait, Crash Course In Brain Surgery, Blitzkrieg, Breadfan, Stone Dead Forever, and Too Late Too Late.
067942850X|2.0|Okay- so I'm only half way through the book, but I still don't get that feeling that you get when a book just captures your imagination. Mabey thats cause it's nonfiction, but still, it's almost as borring as heck. I mean, wheres the mystery in it? Sure, this guy leaves life as we know it out to rot and instead takes the dangerous road of life, but how many other people have done the same? Look at the hippy era for instance. Everyone suddenly deciced that they wanted to live a life on the road. My parents are from that time. So this guy went more than overboard in deciding that he wanted to live off the wilderness, but alot of other people have done the same, as the book reveals. If Krakauer knew how to write a book, he wouldn't have done that. It ruins the whole story when he begins to tell how other people have died doing the same thing- searching for some meaning to life. But I do have to admit, that guy who educated hiself for fun, then decided to live in the stone age was pretty cool. If the book was about him, well, it would of been something different cause no one has ever done that before, or even considered it. And thats probably my point here- you can tell what will happen in the book cause its something that hear about in everyday life. It's nothing new. And thats what a good book is- something new that stimulates the imagination.
B00005JM09|5.0|Let me say that first, do not watch this and expect a James Cameron flick. If you do, you are going to be let down. While the movie is good, its not as strong of a movie like T2. T1? I dont know. <br />First off, when I heard about the plot, I thought it was going to be uber-lame. I didnt think it was going to work. I didnt know how in the WORLD they were going to have a good plot when t2 pretty much wrapped things up. I was maybe expecting a half ass sequel, thats typical from Hollywood. I was wrong. <br />T-850 (Arnold)- It was great seeing Arnold back in his signature role. He was born for this role. He did a fantastic job, as usual, as the T-850. <br />Terminatrix (Kristinna Loken) - This villian is awesome. The most powerful Terminator yet. She makes the T1000 look like a puppy. She has so many new gadgets and tricks in her cyborg body, that she is completely unpredicable as a villian. Not too mention she has a mighty good look to her men should enjoy .  <br />John Conner (Nick Stahl) - I thought this guy did pretty good. i missed the original John, but oh well. He did good. I usually hate it when in sequels, they bring back characters but put new actors in their shoes (Clarice Starling of SOTL, Batman, etc), but this guy is great. He's a much older John (23 if I remember correct?). <br />Kate (Claire Danes)- I really liked her character. She was strong...she was smart....she was also kinda funny in some scenes. She is really entertaining in the film, and it seems a lot of attention is on her, just as much as it is on John Conner. I loved her. If T4 is made, which by the end of this movie that is a possibility, then I hope they bring her back. <br />PROS <br />-The comedy relief was at the right place at the right time. Not too much. <BR>-Fast paced. It keeps you glued from beginning to end. <BR>-Some of the best action scenes I have seen in a movie. The first half of the movie is some of the best action I have seen in a while. <BR>-Arnold returning as the T-850. <br />-The plot. I love how they fit everything in. Its great. I thought it would be lame,but it isn't. Just see the movie. <BR>-The TX. She is the bad of the bad my friend. <BR>-Awesome Special F/X. Stan out did himself here. <br />CONS <br />-No Terminator themes from T1 or T2 is in T3. <br />-\\"She'll be back\\" and \\"I'm back\\" in the film. I would have just stuck with \\"I'll be back\\" and put it in one scene. They kinda cheesed it up using it twice. <br />- \\"You remind me of my mother\\"....Like I said, while Kate is a great character, I didnt really see her as a Sarah Conner. <br />Overall, I loved this film. I went in, not knowing what would come my way. Would it [not be good]? Would it be a disgrace? Would it mess up the storyline that T1 and T2 formed? Answer is NO. My only complaints are minor ones (besides the original theme missing....thats kinda a big one....but I lived without it). <br />If your a real big fan of the Terminator (like me ) go see it. Don't expect a T2. Youll be let down. I promise. <br />If your just someone that has seen both T1 and T2, go see it. You'll enjoy it with the fast paced plot and cool action scenes. <br />My Grade: A-
0385504209|5.0|This novel uses a conventional thriller/murder mystery as a backdrop to explore the roots of Gnosticism that evolved into modern Christianity. But you don't have to be interested in religion to enjoy this book. As the story unfolds, the reader is invited to solve several riddles that on the surface may appear impenetrable. Yet once explained, the answers seem almost obvious. Mr. Brown uses several traditional methods, including letter transpositions and mathematical series. But even the most seasoned code-breaker will not be disappointed. Each riddle links perfectly to the next and carries the plot to a surprising but logical conclusion. No Hitchcock MacGuffin here. Underneath the mystery and conundrum lies an intriguing commentary on the emergence of one of the world's dominant religions. True believers will consider this book to be more heresy. Feminists will see an ally. The truth is that it can be read on several different levels and interpreted in a number of ways, all of them enagaging even if you disagree with the author's views. Read this book if you like murder mysteries, word or math puzzles, have an open mind about the roots of religious beliefs and like strong female protagonists.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Paul Greengrass has delivered the seminal cinematic essay on the origins of Ireland's troubled history. There are precious few heroes in the course of this film, and while many start out with noble intentions, the road to hell is quickly tarmacadamed.<br />This is a gripping film shot in cinema-verite style. My Viet Namese companion was uncertain whether the film was actually a real time documentary. The film aims to lay out what happened that created such a monumental disaster and it leaves you emotionally and horrifically exhausted. This is the dropping of the gauntlet and the levels of betrayal, prejudice, manipulation, ulterior motives undercut and destroy the human fabric. What was begun as a bi-partisan civil rights march ignited a six-county corner of the Irish island into a bonfire that still has not burned out. This was arson of the soul. In the murder of this day bitter enemies would find the justificatiion for more than 30 years of murder, mayhem, gun and drug-running, brutality, rape and desecration. Pandorra's box was opened, and all manner of evil was let loose in a society that could just have easily adopted a peaceful resolution. In the aftermath of the death and destruction of this day, modern terrorism from the IRA through the UVF to the PLO and Osama Bin Laden was born and found its legs to launch attack upon attack on the dignity of life. Governments learned to collude with gangsters. Noble human values were bought, sold , subjugated to one side's polemics or another.<BR>To Greengrass's tremendous credit, he takes no sides. He allows the tragedy to unfold objectively. This film puts the lie to the Irish American sentimentality over the IRA and sets the stage for the rapacious and vicious assault suureptitiously promulgated by Margaret Thatcher. For the purposes of this film, this is the people on the street who by little decisions, squeezes of a trigger and bewilderment at the hell let loose, open floodgates to violence here to fore unimagined. This was the singular event that brought all the snakes back to Ireland, and Greengrass films them in an unblinking fashion. Perhaps no other film, save maybe HARRISON'S FLOWERS, so effectively captures just how horribly man is capable of betraying everything that is good about him. Had we not been thrown out of Eden before this horrible day, then we'd surely have been sent packing after this. Jim Nesbitt leads a remarkable cast. At no point do you ever have the sense that these are actors.<br />If you are sick to death of the green or orange sweater brigades who sloganize terror and murder, this is the film for you. If you are given to marching for one side or another, this film states quite clearly, God forgive you.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is one of the strongest Iron Maiden albums overrall. Although most fans and critics seems to disagree with me, I think it surpasses 'The Number of the Beast' in terms of creativity, originality and plain old heavy metal thunder. Although the album doesnt have any tracks as eponymous or memorable as 'Hallowed be thy Name' or 'Run to the Hills',it does push the boundaries of Maidens sound and vision. 'Revelations' is a standout track: moments of delicate, almost acoustic harmony give way to massive riffs and vivid lyrics. Quality is consistent througout however: 'Where eagles dare' is a raucous, hyper-kinetic opener, 'Die With your boots on' is almost punk in its simplicity and speed, while 'The  Trooper' contains one of the best riffs from the Maiden repetoire, encapsulating ferocity and melody perfectly. 'Flight of Icarus' tackles mythological themes in trademark Maiden style, while 'To Tame a Land' is the closing epic which was fast becoming obligatory for Maiden- as ever it is spectacular, with Frank Herberts 'Dune' used as a template for one of the most destinctive Maiden songs-the lengthy instrumental conclusion is impressive in its ambitiousness. There is a dash of filler here ('Quest for Fire') but the overall quality and diversity of material here makes for a fantastic record. In a very worthy follow up to 'The Number of the beast' Maiden prove the extent of their talents, and foreshadow the uniform greatness that was to follow, for some years at least.
B000006TG7|5.0|This is the Aussie version of LET THERE BE ROCK, and I think that this is one of the best albums the boys ever made. It has a different cover than the international release and we also have the track CRABSODY IN BLUE which is a killer slow blues song which was replaced by PROBLEM CHILD,another good song, on the international release. CRABSODY is reason enough to give this album 5 stars, but we also have the killer classic songs LET THERE BE ROCK, and WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE. Besides those 3 tracks you wont be dissapointed with GO DOWN, OVERDOSE, BAD BOY BOOGIE, HELL AINT A BAD PLACE TO BE. If you like AC/DC, then I recommend that you buy this version anywhere you can find it. I found mine on ebay, and I love this album. Only album the boys made that is better is HIGHWAY TO HELL.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the best (if not THE best) book I have ever read. Talk about a thought provoking book..this is it. Those who are of the Pagan/Wicca/Catholic beliefs will TOTALLY enjoy the read. I don't think the Catholic church will see it that way, but with all the true facts in this book, they may be upset. BEST READ EVER.
0312932081|5.0|For anyone who has not experienced the saga of Ender Wiggin I cannot recommend this book enough.  Following the early life of Andrew (Ender) Wiggin, the book captures the interest right off.  It quickly moves to the battle school where children are forged into the military leaders of the future.  One cannot help but pity Ender as he is forged into one of the greatest military leaders in human histoy.  The story line is well conceived, the plot moves quickly and the characters are interesting.  I would easily place this book in my top five SF novels of all time.  If you have never read this novel, read it.  If you have read it, read it again...it's worth it!
B000084T18|3.0|why is this dude being touted as the future of hip hop? He is an average rapper with backing from eminem and dre. I keep waiting to be enlightened or something. i just dont get it. Another thing...it's like this dude sold out before he was even popular with that (frighteningly ja rule'ish) 21 questions. Let's act gangsta but throw in some lame tracks for the pop masses. let's welcome the latest \\"pop\\" sensation...50 cent!
B00001QEE7|5.0|This movie is all around a wonderful movie.  The songs, the animation all of it is great. It is truly a classic that people of all ages will enjoy. All I have to do is put this in the DVD player and both of my children are quiet from beginning to end, they are 3 and 1 we know how hard it is to keep the attention of children this age. I will admit, I personally enjoy is as well. No doubt, this is a must have for any DVD collection, especially if you have small children.
B000092ZYY|5.0|HTTT is brilliant. I know because I can feel it. Usually, in any album, the 1st track is always important. Thats why OK was such a great album. It seemed radiohead never had to do any persuasion. &quot;In an interstellar burst, i am back to save the universe.&quot; Thom's voice is just filled with honesty and sends a shiver down your spine. And what about the 1st track in HTTT?<BR>The song starts out innocent enough, but when it reaches the 2nd minute, the song justs...wow. When Thom yells &quot;because&quot;, the song just unleashes all its fury. I knew I had a brilliant album there and then. Kid A and Amnesiac never hit me like this.<br />The rest of the album is powerful as well. I Will, Sail To The Moon, A Wolf At The Door, etc just hit you. I believe the radiohead hype. They are indeed the best. To all fans, its time to plug in the headphones and shut your eyes. There can be no excuse.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Flight of the Osiris, made by same group that produced Final Fantasy, is the compelling reason to get this DVD. The other works found along with it simply pale in comparison... indeed I already have forgotten most of them.
B000002HH2|4.0|One thing about Bjork, she'll either miss you completely with one of her songs or nail you right between the eyes. A few songs on Post miss me completely (the slower ones in My Headphones, Cover Me and You've Been Flirting Again don't do a lot for me).<BR>But the rest... wow...<BR>Isobel, I Miss You and The Modern Things are all irresistably catchy. You'll find them in your head hours after you've listened to them.<BR>But the highlight here is Hyperballad, a song many electronica artists rate as a classic. Its chorus lifts you so high that you'll want to keep playing it over just for the rush you get listening to it.<BR>There may be a couple of dud songs on Post, but the rest will keep you coming back, time and time again.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Gangs of New York was probably my favorite movie of 2002, I ended up seeing it in the theater 4 times. I love the way this movie turned out, even Leonardo DiCaprio was decent. But the one thing that set this movie apart from any other I have seen in memory, is the acting job done by Daniel Day-Lewis. Incredible, I was so into his role I was convinced that he was actually Bill the Butcher in real life. Just plain menacing. His way of speaking was just so fresh and uncommon for a historical film, and I loved every minute of it. On to the DVD. I have been counting down the days for this to be released on DVD, and yesterday I flew out to the store on my lunch break to pick it up. Ok, the cover art was changed from what I had seen earlier on movie theater posters, which in my opinion, was much better. On the cover there is that big huge stone gray box proclaiming \\"10 ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS\\", yet the film was robbed completely of awards it so much deserved. Opening the 2-Disc keep case, I was COMPLETELY shocked to find there was no booklet inside. What happened here folks??? Just a plain case with mediocre layout, no booklet, and two discs. A little disappointed, but I bought the movie for the movie, not for the case. On to the First disc. Because of the length of the film, and the full length audio commentary track by Martin Scorsese, the film has been split into two parts on two discs. Special features are located on both. The menus are not bad, but could have been better, with parts of the film score playing quietly in the background. Watching the movie, the colors are very vibrant, and have deep blacks. Some scenes however, make the colors TOO vibrant, and almost burned out looking,(Example: When Bill comes riding in on the fire wagon, the light on the front is almost fluorescent magenta! Same with the fireworks scenes.) Audio is ok as well, but not what I expected. Shouts in the main square scenes echo almost unrealistically, and some shouts were almost too quietto be a shout. Special features are great, with the one major disappointment being the \\"Sneak Peeks\\" option. Basically what we have is about 8 full previews for different Miramax titles. Couldn't that have been left out? A little shameless marketing can't hurt I guess. All in all, for a movie I rated 9 out of 5 stars, I have to give a rating of 3 stars for the DVD. For such an epic, I feel it deserved a much more refined treatment in all areas.<BR>God Bless DVD.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|This album contains the magical title track, the darn good Money For Nothing and several other songs that become comfortingly brilliant after a few listens. Unfortunately, for me, the quality of this album is compromised by the high quotient of cheap and cheerful songs (written purely to profit from the advertising buisness? maybe) Don't get me wrong, it's a brilliant album but I think that as greatest albums go, it loses out to ones that have more a theme, or more consistantly entertaining tracks. Walk Of Life either makes you grit your teeth or dance round like a loon, and unfortunately on the day of writing I wasn't feeling too charitable. <br />Brothers in Arms is a brilliant song, (swansong for the last hundred years? if swan song means what I think it means, then yes)It's just a pity that the greater part of the rest of the album isn't in the same league.
B00003CXCS|5.0|In general, I hate musicals. But there's always been something about The Sound of Music that I cherish. Perhaps it's because it's based on a true story, or perhaps it's because the musical numbers are so well written that I actually enjoyed them. Either way, it's one of the very few musicals that I appreciate.<br />The 5 Star edition DVD, while somewhat hard to track down, is definately worth the hunt. Don't sissy out and buy that crummy never-should-have-been-released single disc edition. This is the one to get. You get hours of in-depth history about the real-life Von-Trapp family, as well as alot of in-depth information about the Sound of Music musical, from it's birth as a broadway musical to it's silver screen debute. It's definately worth all the trouble it takes to find a copy.
B00005JKN9|5.0|It's easy to be a snob about Scorsese's work and think you know every second of every movie and exactly why Scorsese made the cinematic choices he has during his career.  It's easy to talk about the actors you've never liked and never given a chance in the context of a new picture.  But it's also just as easy to sit and enjoy a film regardless of all of these characteristics.  Who cares if you have seen every Scorsese film?  Why does that mean you have to start rating this in terms of every other film the second you start watching?  Doesn't that take the joy out of enjoying a film?  I understand that the more you watch you will naturally select a film you find more valuable or more entertaining on repeat viewing, but when you force it from the beginning and you hack away at a film because it's not your concept of Irish pride (and as someone of Irish heritage, I don't think that Scorsese's idea was for you to worship the Dead Rabbits as one reviewer nearly put it...the cannons shot off and broke up everything at the end for a reason) or your ideal of New York during this time period.  It's a fictitious film based on a nonfiction text.  If you watched and didn't enjoy because it failed to keep your interest or for some other valid reason, fine.  That's a truly helpful negative review, but stroking your own ego with your knowledge of Raging Bull or Herbert Asbury's source material or whatever is just a waste of your time and the time of the readers on amazon.com.  But what do I know?  I'm just a film snob anyway.
B00005JL95|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite disney movies. I laugh myself silly everytime I watch it. Not only is it funny but also shows the importance of family. The story line is a realistic situation. It shows that sometimes outsiders have the best ideas and can become your best friend. Also has a great soundtrack.
B00005JM09|5.0|...<br />OK, I HAVE seen it. In my opinion it is a very worthy sequel to the series. It continues the storyline in an excellent way. The special effects are great, and work as part of the storyline. And the (intentional) humor, especially a running gag involving sunglasses, is well used.<br />It is obvious the intention is not to stop here, and I would welcome future contunuations. I especially like the fact that this is a tragedy, not a \\"triumph\\" movie. They have even hinted at where the story is going, ala we now know (sort of) how John Conner dies! But that will need to be given more detail in the next sequel.<br />I'd really probably only give this movie 4 stars, since it does not exist on its own, but requires the previous movies (I have no problem with this, but it is not as strong as if it did hold up entirely on its own, like the original movie did). I have given it a 5 star rating to combat those stupid people who have brought down the average based on what they THINK it will be like. Good thing nobody is rating their intelligence... :)
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I love this movie. It's a great kids as well as grown ups movie. It makes monsters look cute and cuddly. It is also good for helping children get over there fear of monsters and the dark by creating a great story line that monsters don't scare because they want to, but because they are dependant on screams for life.
B0000028M7|5.0|That's right, you heard me.  There has never been a band with the dynamic sound and musical genius of Alice In Chains.  Their sound transcends so many different genres, and yet sounds as if they could make a classic album by playing any one of those styles the whole time.  This album helped usher them into national stardom, they should have already been there with Facelift.  The sad death of lead singer Layne Staley brings this band's legacy to a close.  To see their influence, listen to this CD, then listen to Taproot, Godsmack (who named themselves after a song on this album), and a slew of other modern hard rockers.  They all know what you should, this band deserves to have their albums and their style played to the bone.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This movie is a little darker than it's predessor but then Harry is a little older too. A wonderful movie that my daughter enjoys watching too. The effects are amazing and the story line is superb.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I remember listening to this album fo the first time.  When the first haunting notes of the opening track sounded, I could already tell this was quite a departure from Agaetis Byrjun, the last Sigur Ros album.  While dramatic  songwriting and grand orchestras dominated that album, () is much more dow to earth.  Thats not to say its ordinary--not at all.  The music here is still etheral, beautiful stuff,  its just something a four piece band could pull off live without additional musicians.  While I'm sure some would disagree with me, I found this to be a welcome change.  This change suits the music here perfectly.  The minimal approach to some of these songs adds a chilling effect to their already wintry, nocturnal sound.  The first four songs on this album are incredible.  Its one of the best continuous stretches of music I can recall.  From there, Things get a bit more subdued until the albums' cathartic closer, which is my favorite track here.  All in all, () is a great album, even though it is a bit of a departure from earlier Sigur Ros stuff.  Anyone who enjoys innovative, beautiful music will apprecite this album.
B00005A1PR|5.0|The lyrics of &quot;Video&quot; is a preview of the &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;.  She shares that her entertainment is only about the music rather than the image.  Her songwriting and soulful singing prove her sincerity.  She has mastered the soulful guitar sound that few others have.  &quot;Brown Skin&quot; showcases this at the highest.  If you listen to this CD, I will guarantee that you will feel beautiful inside and out.
B00005NGAL|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD. THis is the best edition to buy. I highly reccomend it.
076780421X|5.0|This is a delightful and funny movie, Matthew and Selma are both great, there was a real chemistry with their character's. The Parents were just as great, Perry's real dad played Alex' dad. This is one of my favorite movies. It is funny, warm and romantic. Just adorable.

B00005T7I1|3.0|Back in 1931,an Oklahoma born comic strip writer/artist named Chester Gould moved to Chicago.While trying to ply his trade,he became fascinated by the gang wars that were fast becoming apart of city life.After all,this was the city Al Capone ruled like King Arthur in Camelot.At the time,Capone's empire was under fire from the G-Men.Specifically,a young,head-strong G-Man named Eliot Ness(Maybe you've heard of him?).It was from this legendary rivalry that inspired Gould to create crimebuster Dick Tracy.Gould used real life gangsters like Capone,Dillinger,\\"Pretty Boy\\" Floyd,and \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly as inspiration for a grotesque band of outlaws like \\"Big Boy\\" Caprice,Flattop,Pruneface,Mumbles,and hundreds of others.Gould's gripping crime dramas,colorful villians,and unique gadgets made it one of the era's most popular comics.Rivaling Superman and Batman.However,this did not transalate to big screen success(with the exception of a bunch of RKO serials).Then actor/director Warren Beatty,who grew up reading the Dick Tracy comics,decided that the time was right for the \\"squared jawed detective\\" to get the big budget blockbuster treatment.As a fan of the Tracy comics(I became a fan because of the movie),I thought he did a good job with the movie.It's rich and lively and Al Pacino's \\"Big Boy\\" is a terrific send-up of his larger than life baddies like Michael Corleone and \\"Scarface\\" (Which is what Al said he was doing).Madonna also sizzles as songstess \\"Breathless\\" Mahoney.Don't laugh,but she does a good acting job.After all,she's playing a singing,sex siren....Oh....I forgot....she does that anyway!Although a variety of Hollywood legends like Dick Van Dyke,Dustin Hoffman,James Caan,and R.G. Armstrong make memoralbe appearnces(\\"Bonnie & Clyde\\" alumnists Estelle Parsons and Michael J. Pollard also appear),it's William Forsythe who joins Madonna and Al Pacino in the scene stealing as trigger-happy madman Flattop.All in all,the film is a good bit of nostalga for comic book fans who may wonder what comics were like before the flood of super-heroes.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|I love FM.  I'm not an avid fan, but a casual one.  After purchasing this, I have to say that the original 1988 GH set is the far superior one.  At least with that release, one has a single disc and can sequence the songs into a chronological order if one wishes.  Many folks like to see an artist develop over time with a GH set, not sequence the tracks scatter-shot, as if it's a concert set-list.<br />The live tracks are totally unnecessary here as they have already been released on a live album, where they belong.<br />The non-hit tracks here are good, but could easily be heard on an additional disc-\\"Fan Favorites\\" or some such title.  Put the hits on one disc, hopefully sequenced chronologically and the fan faves on another for a double disc treat.  Then, everyone's happy.  :)<br />Tony
B00005JM09|2.0|Overall, Jonathon Mostow's directing is good. But this movie fails from the script more than anything else. It lacks everything that James Cameron would have included: the heart, the humanity, etc.  James could not have written a script this bad if you sawed his head in two. Also, the acting is mediocre at best and there are a number of plot holes. And the over-use of cheesey comedy is often noticeable -- at times I felt like I was watching a MadTV spoof on the Terminator films. <br />I am very let down by this movie -- you you should be too.
B00005JM09|5.0|What can I say, I wasn't let down coming out of the movie.  Where to begin, well there's really only a couple of things I can say about the movie.  This movie has tons of action sequences in it.  I never thought a film could have so much.  Take Jerry Bruckhemier and John Woo and put them together, this is what kind of actions in this movie.  My friends and I were amazed.  But with the action comes a price.  One part, and the only thing i can think of(and i'm stretching a bit)is the character development, don't get me wrong the characters are developed, but not just as much in the last 2 terminators.  With all the action, something had to suffer.  But it did not suffer that much.  If you saw the last 2 terminators, you understand there character and why they need to survive for.  So for me, it wasn't that big of a deal.  <br />The chase scene in the movie is the best action scene I have ever scene.  The movie does not look fake either, the CG is very well blended and does look over done.<BR>Arnold looks great I must say for being 55+ years old.  I would say he has another 10 years of action films by the way he looks.  <br />Again, i recommend this movie for Terminator fans and anyone who likes good action films.  <BR>Great movie I must say!
037542217X|5.0|In the latest book in THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY series, Precious Ramotswe, the first female private detective in Botswana, has issues:  (1) a strutting, cocky new detective has opened shop in Gaborone and is threatening her business; (2) one of the children in her care has taken up a bad habit; (3) her secretary/assistant, Mma Makutsi is involved with a suspicious man; (4) Mma Makutsi has opened a sideline business, teaching men to type and (5) a client has given her an urgent, delicate assignment.<br />Like Jan Karon's gentle fiction, I never tire of stories about Precious, her finance, her employee, and their lives in Africa.  True, there is no thrilling action (unless you count the miracle in the garage....or the death of a water pump), but there is plenty of heart and some wonderful soul in Alexander McCall Smith's stories about the first female detective in Botswana.<br />Read the books in order.  THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENY.  TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE.  MORALITY LESSONS FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.  THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.<br />Enjoy!!!
6304366078|2.0|&quot;Grand Prix&quot; attempts to be soap opera &amp; race movie, &amp; manages neither well. <br />As a race movie, it details Monaco &amp; Monza with the high banked curves. In between the first &amp; last race of the season, everything else is brushed off. Spa gets some spots because of many shunts; many tracks are not even shown on screen, only mentioned in passing. <br />While the cinematography may have pioneered, it gets self-indulgent, where the multiple split screen is used without serving any purpose of story-telling or tension. While at some points they work (the last race, to show internal flashbacks of the driver on one side &amp; that driver at the race on the other; to show the major drivers &amp; then zoom in on one), far too often they simply distract from the story &amp; bore the viewer. These happen mostly during the &quot;many races pass&quot; section, when we might have seen some racing, instead.<br />On the level of story &amp; character, this film fails even more miserably. James Garner is stuck playing a cipher: as another one says, &quot;All anyone knows about you is that you're a driver.&quot; His reply: &quot;That's right.&quot; Other than being desperate to race, he has absolutely no character traits, past, emotions, or motivation.<br />The ones who have those attributes have such hokey inconsistent ones that they are thoroughly unbelievable. 4ex: a woman leaves the driver she's married to because she can't stand the stress of waiting for him to rack up. At that point she takes up with -- another driver. Supposedly this is because she doesn't love him, so she won't be bothered. We are supposed to believe that she just didn't get completely out of the race world? When she leaves her husband is immediately after a terrible accident that might end his driving career, too. She comes back to him later, even though she still hates the whole business, because he has shown true guts, not &quot;just stubborness,&quot; about getting back into competition. All the characters are so phony, or so stiffly acted, we could never really identify with one.<br />The end is an especially fizzle. A main character dies, but because he has reached no resolutions, it is not a tragedy, it is not a climax, it's just an accident. Garner is finally left standing on the empty track, hearing the motors roar, but because we have no sense of any conflict or interior life for this character, it is all just empty sound -- rather like the whole movie.<br />As the final insult, in the VHS transfer the sound levels are extremely irregular.<br />On the whole, we got the impression, not of a racing movie, but of an anti-racing movie. We won't waste time on it again. We'll watch Le Mans for the 30th time, instead.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I grew up with Daredevil. It was my favorite comic book since I read my very first issue which featured Bullseye, coincidently.  I cannot tell you how excited I was for this movie to come out.<br />But I was really disappointed.  There were a lot of good thing.  For instance, the movie did a very good job of showing you what Matt Murdock \\"sees\\".  It was also good to have the three main characters from the comic book in the storyline.  The Kingpin was portrayed faily well, Bullseye was WONDERFULLY done (he really hit the mark...), and Electra was okay (she didn't really seem to catch the spirit that the Electra from the comic book had).<br />But what killed me was how wrong they got the story.  When I saw how Matt went blind, all I could think was, \\"Oh, no.  They couldn't have been more wrong!\\"  What, did they think that the original story was just too unbelievable or something?  I can see them discussing it now, \\"You know, we've got Ben Affleck running around in rubber supposedly blind as a bat but able to do backflips and jump roof to roof with the greatest of ease.  But, come on, is anybody really going to believe that THIS is how he went blind?\\"  COME ON!!  If you are going to adapt a great story, how about sticking with what made it great.  More can be said on this, but they didn't take too many liberties with Spider-man, and look how well they did.<br />The story and plot didn't keep me too interested.  The emotion between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner didn't leave me convinced.  All in all, I wasn't that impressed with the movie.  They had sooooo much potential and it seems to me that they really blew it.  If they are going to trash such a good comic book, I really hope they don't make a sequel.
B000006UNG|5.0|To the reviewer who said this album was mostly unknown outside the circle of Talk Talk aficionados, you're in luck!  I hadn't even HEARD of the band until I saw this album mentioned in an interview of Rick Wright, Pink Floyd's keyboardist.  On a lark I decided to give it a try--and sure enough, his taste proved extraordinary.<br />&quot;The simplicity of the songs and Mark Hollis's voice make this album just incredible,&quot; Mr. Wright had explained to Record Collector magazine.  &quot;The first tune, 'Happiness Is Easy', says it all--nothing but a bass, a snare and a weird chord. That's Talk Talk all over, great songs and simplicity with a twist ... Why does it touch me? Hard to say, but it's got the feelgood factor, which all my favourite records have...&quot;<br />From the second I heard the opening to &quot;Happiness is Easy&quot;, I knew every word of Mr. Wright's was dead-on accurate.  &quot;Colour of Spring&quot; is indeed a most appropriate title--I immediately felt a sense of gentle, uplifting power coming from the music.  Although pensive, sometimes even sad in the lyrics at times, he does not go overboard with it.  Mr. Hollis' voice becomes like a musical instrument in its own right, mingling perfectly with the open, never overpowering musical arrangements.<br />Particularly striking about this album are the Hammond organ played by Steve Winwood, which floats gently in the background and provides each track is atmosphere.  The acoustic guitar and piano seem to dance gracefully in and out of the songs.  Overall, Colour of Spring is incredibly soothing, but without putting the listener to sleep.  This is the perfect album to unwind from a stressful day, and definitely a recommendation worth listening to!
B00005QDW1|1.0|People. I have few words to say :)  Just this..do not let the agglomeration of pop culture fool you into buying this cd.  The band has lost whatever it had...or its been stolen from then.  Avoid this cd like the plague if you are a No Doubt fan.
B000002N1E|5.0|I bought this album when it came out, and to this day it still remains an all time favourite of mine. The best song is of course &quot;Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot;, an all-time Prince classic. Other favourites songs are &quot;P Control&quot; and &quot;I Hate U&quot;. His best of the 90's, and one of his all-time best! If you've never heard Prince, you don't know what you're missing.
B000056NX5|5.0|I have been a &quot;Superstar&quot; fan for over 30 years, and have seen many versions.  This one should be the definitive production for posterity.  It is near perfect.  Musically, technically, dramatically, and theatrically, it is simply superb.  As a former singer myself, I was especially impressed by the voices and particularly the diction.  Technically, the sound picks up the perfect diction of the singers so that no words are missed at all.  Glenn Carter as Jesus has a beautiful voice and brings out Jesus's humanity.  Jerome Pradon as Judas, while maybe not perfect visually, is musically right on and exhibits Judas's agony.  His voice is the best Judas I've heard.  Renee Castle, although no Yvonne Elliman, brings her own persona as Mary Magdalene.  Fred Johanson as Pilate is powerful and dramatic, with a gorgeous voice especially in &quot;Pilate and Christ.&quot;  Two minor imperfections in my view:  in &quot;Pilate's Dream,&quot; Johanson overacts a bit; and I would have preferred more singing and less speaking in rhythm for Rik Mayall's Herod.  With those two minor exceptions, this is a magnificent production in all respects and should replace almost everyone's library of CDs and videos trying to achieve the ultimate &quot;Superstar.&quot;
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore's exceptional work on The Fellowship of the Ring is continued to an even more grandiose effect in The Two Towers. My favourite track, &quot;Foundations Of Stone&quot; is a strident track that is both exciting and inspiring. The felloship theme used in the previous score is again heard in &quot;The Taming Of Smeagol&quot; and &quot;The Riders Of Rohan&quot; is a moving piece that plays very softly without being sentimental. &quot;Passage Of The Marshes&quot; is a somewhat unsettling but well-crafted track that plays the themes of that traverse throughout the film. &quot;The Uruk-hai&quot; is a familiar theme, with the low percussions and strong resonant tones which are as memorable as they are intimidating. &quot;The King Of The Golden Hall&quot; is a very strong piece with the Rohan theme played quietly. Other highlights include &quot;Treebeard&quot;, &quot;Helm's Deep&quot;, &quot;The Hornburg&quot; and &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;. Emiliana Torrini's haunting, beautiful &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; and Farewell To Lorien finish the CD off nicely. Like the great composers (Williams, Fellini.[fill in) Shore's music works well outside the film. The foldout sleeve with notes is nice too. I can't wait for the soundtrack for Return of the King.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I always feared having to write a review of this album, but I guess I can accept it as a challenge, and attempt the impossible. For truly, how could one review something like a part of their lives, a place where they lived, or a transitioning period? To me the album brings on smells, tastes, and visions from all three of those stages.<br />Objectively, American Beauty has its flaws. The songs were done in the studio, something the band never looked forward to, and a little bittle of evolution, well, took some of these songs a long way. Look at Sugar Magnolia and Truckin' for instance, two of the bands most famous works, they never became great songs until they played them live, let them evolve, unfold, and bloom. Any experienced listener would take a live Truckin' or Sugar Magnolia over the studio versions anyday. But that doesn't really matter, because what the rest of the album has to offer is probably the best of what folk and rock music have to offer....<br />Box of Rain, Ripple, Brokedown Palace, Candyman, Friend of the Devil, and Attics of My Life.<br />Of all the jazz, classical music, folk & roots music, and world & ethnic music I have ever listened to, I still have not found songs which parallel these in their strength and grandeur. These are'nt merely songs, these are moments, these are Zen watercolor paintings, and they are the most sincere, and human pieces of art that I have ever come to know. <br />Coming to know these songs was like developing a new sense for me. It was like seeing, or smelling, or hearing for the first time, when the buddha sprang from beneath the bodhi tree he must have felt similar. I truly envy you if you have never listened to these songs, I would pay astronomical amounts of money to hear these songs again for the first time.<br />But then again, that was another time, another world....
B00003CXXP|3.0|The movie confuses not only itself, but also the viewer in terms of what it is trying to achieve, where it actually wants to go, and how to go about it. Initially, it starts off as a typical sci-fi movie, which exemplifies what would be one of the zeniths of the future-man's creation: the creation of custom-made robots, which not only look and feel like humans, but are also designed to exhibit a certain types of behaviors, and feel certain kinds of emotions. Then, the movie tries to answer the question, \\"can humans offer the same kind of unconditional love, as offered by the custom-made `mecha'?\\" by taking the example of David, and how he tries to get himself accepted by a `human'-family. The movie goes on fine through the course, which shows the various problems faced by the `mecha', and the `human' family, in trying to accept each other.<br />After the point at which David is deserted by his family, the movie, then goes through a labyrinth, trying to give a totally different meaning to it, and deviating from what it had actually started off with, until the end, which again tries to continue from where it had left off, about an hour ago. Though the movie ends well, (conceptually, though again, the execution is flawed by the introduction of aliens, (or futuristic robots of the ice-age, whichever it might be) who exhume David, and try to fulfill his wish) by the time the movie arrives at this point, it has passed through so many confusing and supererogatory paths in-between, that the charm of this otherwise `touching' ending, and the movie, as a whole is completely lost.<br />The beginning and the ending of the movie are coherent with the punch line, \\"can humans respond equally to the unconditional love, the `mecha' bestows upon them?\\" However, in the middle, it tries to depict that the human is, and always will be evil, by showing that the future-man will not only create the `perfect' robot, (or make his `best creation ever') he will also mercilessly destroy his owncreation, regardless of their feelings, and the viewers are supposed to feel sorry about this. In the midst of all this, the story takes the shape of a fairy-tale, in which the protagonist, (in this case David) is in a search for the `blue-fairy', who he believes, will make him a `real' boy, so that his `mommy' will love him. These links, which try to build up the ending, are not only muddled and fatuous, but also are seriously ill directed, especially the parts concerning the merciless destruction of `mechas', at the `flesh-fair'. <br />Spielberg is one of the best movie-directors of all time; not half as good as Kubrik, though (since this movie is supposed to be conceptually similar to \\"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY\\") and the best, when it comes to creating fantasy-flicks. In this fantasy-movie, however, he has tried to introduce too many ideas, which not only make the movie too long and over-sentimental, but also out-of-focus, from what it actually wants to achieve.
B000069HK2|5.0|this debut album is easily one of the best i've heard in a while.  enough with the labeling what kind of music &amp; which genre it fits into all you need to know is that its a great cd.  every song is unique in its own way.  the songs are so good that each one at some point has been my favorite.  i've had the cd for a long time and i still find myself listening to it.  buy the cd support the band you won't be disappointed.  other good singles not found on the cd are &quot;just a little&quot;, &quot;zero mechanism&quot;, and &quot;alone this holiday&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|Once I started reading...I honestly couldn't put this book down. Dan Brown has done an incredible job researching even the smallest of details for his story. If you like a great story mixed with incredible facts, you will love this book.

B000001G5H|5.0|Pollini's performance of the Etudes achieves what all artists strive for--a vivid representation of all the drama of human existence.<br />For variation, clarity, force, vigor, precision, execution, depth, virtuosity, repeat listening value, and sheer intellectual joy, this recording cannot be beat.  It is better than Gould because it is more human.  You must hear it immediately.  Especially Op. 10 No. 12, the &quot;Revolutionary&quot; Etude.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I think that this film was lacking....a lot. There was little depth to the characters even after the first 90 minutes.  Who are these people? The quick flash of introductions of gangs left no time for absorption.  The romantic aspect with the female was boring to say the least and I didn't see any reason for that character to be in the film. It just dragged the film out about an extra half hour..maybe longer. I wish Speilberg had directed this film or Kevin Costner even (with a better script).  Like Shindlers List or Dances With Wolves, I think it would have given me a more dead-on feel of the times. Maybe I could have cared about the characters instead of just watching them run around punching and cutting each other. Then there was the awkward flash to the rich folks...where they talked about what was going on - as if they were narraters.  Sorry, it was just too hollywood and I learned next to nothing.
B000069AUI|5.0|Bought it for Clocks and I already liked Yellow well enough. Some repetition yes, not always alot of melodic augmentation; they just pull it off. These guys did what they wanted; did what they felt and jammed though. Must have duped company execs completely - 8 of the 11 tunes around 5 minutes length. Through the length of each, they work it out. Not slick. Not over engineered. Every tune tells a picture. CM's voice is an instrument. The sound is London to me. Puts me walking through there lost in the crowd. Smelling double deckers and the rush of wind through the Tube. And its a lifetime of sounds. Pink Floyd, Beatles, STP, ELO, Zepplin, U2. What else, hmmmm, can't put my fanga' on it cause I'm no freakin' Rolling Stone writer. Just love this album for where it takes me.
B00004R99F|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a junior in high school 7 years ago.  I watched this movie at least once a weekend the rest of my high school career. My VHS copy is about to wear out.  This is my all-time favorite (recent)Disney movie.  It has great songs. I have every one memorized.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves animated movies and/or Goofy.
B000099T2L|4.0|This CD is Beyonc's efforts to make a timeless CD. There are awesome uptempo songs on here that make u wanna dance like 'crazy in love', 'naughty girl', 'baby boy', and a lot of other songs...The ballads on this CD are real good too. The remake of Dangerously in Love is good as it showcases Beyonc's vocals and has a new sound to it. My favorite song by far, is 'Yes'. That is what I call timeless. 'The closer I get to you' is one of the best duets I have EVER heard. The way that their voices sound next to each other makes the duet a highlight on 'Dangerously in Love'.Speechless in another song that is approx 6 mins long....although unlike Ashanti's songs it is something that you would like. Ashanti's songs repeat and and just over and over Beyonc's on the other hand is a smooth, slow, relaxing ballad. Another one of the highlights is 'That's how You Like It' that is a mid-tempo song that has Jay-Z on it. I really like that song just for the tune and the way Beyonc sings on it. In addition to a large range of tunes, tempos and collabs, are the writing skills. She [Beyonc] has really showcased her writing skills on her debut. It is, a very different sound to the Destiny's Child sound but all the debuts have been different. The only song that I despise and cannot bear to listen to is...'Gift from Virgo'. I just do not like it. It has hardly any percussion and I simply do not like it. PERIOD. With the Exception of that abomination song, Gift from Virgo, this album is amazing. Everyone has had high hopes for it as the other two did not do as well as anticipated. Kelly's CD sold a bit over 500,000, and Michelle's sold a bit over 100,000. High hopes for a good quality CD. This is a MUST for any Destiny's Child fan.
B00008K7AM|5.0|I had my doubts about this movie at first but I really enjoyed it and have recommended it to several people.  I thought it was very funny and Rob Schneider played a very convincing teenage girl.  The bar scene was one of my favorites and sure, it's predictable and, well, stupid...but it's a comedy!  *laugh  If you've enjoyed films by Rob Schneider and/or Adam Sandler in the past - this one is definitely worth checking out.  Best comedy I've seen in awhile...
B00005JM09|3.0|I went into this movie with diminished expectations. T1 was a classic, T2 was polished perfection...no where to go but down?<br />Nope, I had a ton of fun. Definitely a better experience than the pretentious Matrix Reloaded. The dialogue was funny. Sometimes cheesy, but good cheese..c'mon, you can't say you don't secretly want Arni to say \\"She'll be back\\"? <br />The actors do their job's well. The terminatrix is a very cool villain. She does an incredible job of coming off like a prototype machine getting used to things. Notice the quirky head movements, the \\"self-augmentation\\". Some very nice touches. Arni is Arni...nuff said. He is, and always will be, what makes the Terminator work.<br />I'll put the crane chase toe to toe with the Matrix Freeway scene any day of the week. The effects in this movie are so good they disappear...seriously. They spent a lot on the effects, but there is no \\"in your face\\" feel to them. They blend well into the story and enhance the experience, rather than trying to be an experience themself.
0316666343|2.0|While this book was entertaining through the first half, I found that the author seemed to lose sight of where the book was going, how it was going to end, and why it was even written.  I was pulled into the story immediately with the crime that the story revolves around.  Then, about halfway through the novel I lost interest as nothing was really happening.  The ending, which I struggled to get through, was silly and disappointing.  I pushed through to the last pages hoping the ending would at least be a bang, but unfortunately it was a barely a whimper.  With all the incredible fiction out there, I would not recommend this novel.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I felt this movie picked up where the first x-men left off. Following the x-men comics that I grew up with, they depiceted what the real consiquences where releasing the web of radiation up on all the x-men trying to mutate all the world leaders.  Jean Gray perhaps suffered the most in that her powers were now at peak level. This movie didn't have the fake looking wolverine fighting sabertooth this time which I loved. I also really liked the way they handled wolverine finding out what really happend to him. Over all this movie rocks.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Amazing album by Radiohead, great singles and an overall concept, i personally prefer The Bends, but that it's just me.  I think that any MUSIC fan would love this album, if you like Cristina, Britney or any of the boys bands, you may have to wait until you grow up, and then you may enjoy this piece of art.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the kind of cd that all bands should strive to make.   Every song is a good one, not just the first single.   Linkin Park did it again with this cd collection must have.   Buy it, it is totaly worth the 15 bucks.
0316666343|5.0|The characters in Lovely Bones are people I have met, people I have made my own and through whom I could feel the pain they felt at Susie's death. I knew how her mother felt at needing to escape tragedy and her father's need to dwell in it.  Buckley, the innocent four year old, needed to talk to her, while Lindsey needed to grow up for her.  Susie watched them all miss her, and she yearned for them, and yet growing with them with their every step.  <BR>As I read the book, I realized that everyone could identify with loss, if nothing else in life.  Everyone knows someone they wish they could say one last word to, or touch one last time, and yet they are gone forever.  Since death touches us all, as well as the very thought of the afterlife, Sebold provides a suspended belief in the afterlife and someone watching over us.  As Susie watches her family and friends struggle and move on in each their own way, she too, although 14, becomes the woman she was never allowed to be. <BR>Susie's last encounter with Ray, was just one of the many moments my book became overwhelmed in tears.  It was the moment she had chosen to be her last, to be his. (tears welling at I write)  <BR>I HIGHLY recommend this book.  The novel is based on a simple concept that we have all imagined: someone watching us from heaven, and yet, it sparked thoughts that have kept me reeling since.  <BR>It is quite the emotional roller-coaster though; I felt the innocence of childhood being swallowed by rape and the injustice that followed.  I heard the emotional anecdotes that her family and friends remembered and sometimes shared.  By the end of the novel, I felt Susie was an acquaintance of mine, that perhaps I too had stood in the cornfield singing..........remembering Susie.
B00005QEO1|5.0|PUMP was an even bigger success than Aerosmith's predecessor,PERMANENT VACATION. There are a lot of BIG ONES on this album. LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR became a Top 20 hit as did JANIE'S GOT A GUN,THE OTHER SIDE and WHAT IT TAKES. FINE is an acronym for the following adjectives:F---ED UP,INSECURE,NEUROTIC,EMOTIONAL. Steven Tyler spells the acronym in WHAT IT TAKES. This was one of the best-selling albums in 1990 although it was released in fall 1989. For some reason,the band decided to leave DEUCES ARE WILD off the PUMP album which they would release on the various artists album,THE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD EXPERIENCE in 1993. You can see videos for some of the PUMP tracks on the video,&quot;Things That Go PUMP In the Night&quot;.

B000092T6M|4.0|Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has long been one of my favorite movies.  As a child there was something about the story and the movie that just sucked me right in.  Watching it ten years later, it still holds up and I still love the movie.  This is yet another retelling of the Robin Hood legend, and in many ways, it stays true to the legend of an outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, fights the evil sheriff of Nottingham and tries to save the Maid Marian.  This version feels more realistic.  There is no prancing and the men do not wear tights (naturally, this spawned a wonderful spoof by Mel Brooks, but that is another point all together).<br />The movie opens in a Jerusalem prison.  Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) is a prisoner, along with his friend Peter DuBois.  To protect Peter, Robin tries to take Peter's place at being punished.  Robin also uses this as an opportunity for escape.  He is able to overpower the guards and escape with Peter.  Robin attempts to free other countrymen but is only able to free a moor, Azeem (Morgan Freeman).  They make it out, but Peter is killed during the escape.  Peter makes Robin promise to protect his sister, Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).<br />Arriving in England, Robin meets Guy of Gisborne (Michael Wincott), the Sheriff's cousin.  Robin defends a young boy who is being assaulted for poaching deer.  It is because of his actions here that Robin will come to the attention of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman).  Robin returns home to find that his father has been murdered and his home destroyed.  He vows to avenge his father.  Robin and Azeem now travel to the house of DuBois to meet Marian.  After Robin proves his identity and talks with Marian he is chased to Sherwood Forest by Guy and his men.<br />It is when Robin arrives in Sherwood and joins up with John Little (Nick Brimble) and the other outlaws that the heart of the movie begins.  Seeing the conditions that the outlaws were living in, Robin decides to start fighting back.  He steals some food (and the sheriff's horse) as well as cutting the Sheriff across the cheek with his knife.  This begins the mini-war between Robin and the Sheriff.  He organizes the woodsmen into a community and trains them.  The sheriff is continuing to raise the reward for Robin's capture, but the peasants love Robin more and more for all that he does for them.  Robin is also robbing the rich noblemen who are passing through Sherwood.  These noblemen are carrying bribes from the Sheriff to lead a revolt against the absent King Richard (he is off fighting the crusades).<br />The movie eventually ends with a showdown between Robin and the Sheriff and finally ends with one of the greatest cameos of all time when King Richard returns.  Mixed into this movie is quite a bit of action, and a well done love story between Robin and Marian.  The acting of Costner is not the best you'll ever see, but the movie rises above this (and Costner's lack of an English accent).  Kevin Costner is a serviceable Robin Hood and he comes across as believable and likable.  The rest of the cast is probably what makes the movie work, though.  Everyone is spot on.  Alan Rickman plays a perfectly evil Sheriff and he is the highlight of the movie, stealing every scene he is in.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful and warm as Marian and it is easy to see why Robin would have fallen in love with her.  The only reason this movie did not propel her into being a huge movie star was simply that she didn't want to be one.  The rest of the cast is perfect (Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater being the other two \\"name\\" actors) and really help to set the mood and feel of the movie.  This may have been a summertime epic fantasy, but the movie is a lot of fun and holds up surprisingly well over the years and it remains one of my favorite movies.<br />I should also mention the spectacular soundtrack/score for this movie.  The Robin Hood theme is one of the most memorable themes i've heard and it remains one of my favorites.  The music helps to make the movie.<br />This review was of the special edition DVD.  There are additional and extended scenes that were put back into the movie.  Most of the scenes expand the relationship of the Sheriff and his witch Mortianna.  Several other scenes help explain certain other small things going on in the movie.e most memorable themes i've heard and it remains one of my favorites.

B00005JL9B|5.0|This is possibly the best movie ever made.  it deals with many deep subjects and will keep you on the edge of your seat from scene to scene.  Each character has apeal and one can grow rather fond of many of the kids.<br />In other words?  Get.  This.  Movie.  Now.
B0000640VO|5.0|...But this delightfull French film totally turned me around on the possiblities of the romantic comedy genre.<br />The story of Amelie concerns the title character as she sets out to bring happiness to those around her by very subtle and inventive means rather than trying to repair her own solitary life. The film is surprising and creative from start to finish, so I won't spoil the rest of the story as when I first saw the film I had no idea what to expect and don't want to ruin that first time veiwing experience for anyone else. You just don't know what to expect from one scene to the next in this film, as opposed to Hollywood romantic comedies where the stories are cliched and predictable.<br />Besides the genuinely refreshing originality of Amelie, the film contains an amazing visual style which blends cgi effects into the picture flawlessly and with much great effect and purpose than any of the big budget Hollywood flicks. The music is also great with a main theme which has that really French feel about it. Audrey Tautou is amazing in this film as well, she makes Amelie beleivable and endears her character to the audience in every screen moment. Subtitles work great with this film too as even though I can only speak some basic phrases in French, Audrey Tautou gives Amelie an charming soft impish type voice that would be lost if it was dubbed and but can still be appreciated by anyone who doesn't speak the language. People who refuse to watch subtitled films are losers anway. <br />...P>The only negative thing I could say about Amelie is that theres a real danger that the geniuses in Hollywood might try to remake it much the same way they remade the brilliant and highly origingal Japanse horror masterpiece 'Ringu' into the silly shallow 'Ring'. Other than that Amelie is a wonderous one of a kind film that doesn't come by very often.

B000006ED1|5.0|What can I say about this album!?Im still lost for words!Its truly a masterpiece! Its by far Guardians best and most ambitious album, without being spoiled by overproduction (something I felt was a downside to 'A Night at The Opera')<BR>  Every track, even the shorter ones such as 'face the truth' and 'the minstrel' are carefully thought out and are effective shorter breaks between the longer tracks, such as 'thorn' and 'the eldar.' <BR>  Every time I listen to 'mirror mirror,' the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end!It must be Guardians best song to date and the album is just flawless. There isnt a bad track on it and there are countless epic moments to be found on the album.<BR>  If you are a fan of Guardians 'Battalions of Fear' then you may find the slight lack of 'thrashiness' a small disappointment, but this will soon be overcome by the sheer awesomeness that is this record.<BR>  You MUST buy it! If you only buy one album in your life, IT MUST BE THIS ONE!<BR>  The greatest power metal album by the greatest power metal band of all time. <BR>Hail Blind Guardian!<BR> Long they shall live!
0142004235|5.0|There may be no greater threat to good fiction than high-school literature reading lists, unless it is a critic who believes that having possibly read a book in high school he remembers the book, or understood it if he did read it.<br />I have heard it said that no one should be allowed to read Twain until he has passed his fiftieth birthday.  I think you will find the same is true of most good literature, in this case \\"East of Eden.\\"<br />You have not read the book recently?  You only remember the movie (based on only the last quarter of the book)?  Maybe it was assigned by a teacher.  At that age it was probably very easy to read the sordid parts, giggle at the whores, wonder at Cal, who probably morphs into James Dean as you think about it, put the book down and forget it.  Many of us have done it, many will continue to do it.<br />What high school student can possibly understand Samuel's statement \\"You know, Lee, I think of my life as a kind of music, not always good music but still having form and melody.  And my life has not been a full orchestra for a long time now.  A single note only - and that note unchanging sorrow.  I'm not alone in my attitude, Lee.  It seems to me that too many of us conceive of a life as ending in defeat.\\"  As far as that goes, is it possible for a high school student to conceive of the end of life for either them or their friends?  How many funerals do you have to go to before you understand Adam's knowledge that it would be unthinkable not to go to Samuel's funeral, but at the same time have to maintain his knowledge that Samuel was not dead?  Sure it's easy to wonder why Adam can't see through Cathy, but it takes only one failed marriage to come to the beginning of an understanding.  How many people do you have to know to comprehend the sorrow that drives Tom to suicide when his sister dies?<br />As the author says \\"Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full.  Pain and excitement are in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts - the pleasure of design and some despair and the indescribable joy of creation.\\"  Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem most people who attempt to review this book have is that it has been too long since they read it.  This book has been around for over fifty years.  Many of us read (or were supposed to have read) it in high school.  Many who did think they remember it, or that they understood it.<br />It is an adult book.  It has characters developed over a lifetime.  I have read this book at least 15 times.  It still surprises, depresses, enlightens, engrosses, and thrills me each time I read it.
B000096FUD|4.0|The Windmills of Reality Fight Back.....' -Terry Gilliam<br />In the theater there is an old superstition. Your not supposed to say Macbeth, it's bad luck and sure to destroy your production. I sometimes wished someone would have walked into CATS in 1984 and done that but hey you can't win them all. In film you probably shouldn't say Don Quixote. It could spell disaster as well, just ask Terry Gilliam.<br />If ever there was a story that needed to be filmed it's Cervantes classic novel of a man near the end of his life that reads romantic stories and sets out on an adventure of a life time. Terry Gilliam is very much like Quixote himself. Every film he touches is full of the same whimsy and adventure that Quixote was famous for. You'd think a project entitled THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE would be the perfect Gilliam film and I think it would have. That's what makes Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's documentary LOST IN LA MANCHA so tragic.<br />Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe probably have the greatest job in Hollywood. They follow Terry Gilliam around with a camera. Their earlier film THE HAMSTER FACTOR is an insightful look into Terry Gilliam's visionary science fiction film 12 Monkeys. SO this is probably why they were hired to follow Gilliam around again. To make a short documentary for a future DVD release of THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE. It's lucky they were there or this story would have never been told.<br />LA MANCHA begins very straightforward. Sure there are problems with the pre-production of QUIXOTE, but nothing that is hindering progress. We learn that the budget for the film is much less than it probably should be, but Gilliam as a director has been there before. So he's not worried. The actors begin to show up for costume fittings, schedules are finalized and everything is set to go.<br />Then all hell breaks loose.<br />LOST IN LA MANCHA is a film scholar's dream. Fulton and Pepe have unlimited access to the crew in this movie and each person becomes a character. Not only that, but they also they get mostly unfettered access to Gilliam. I wonder if any other major director would put himself out on a line like this. Gilliam has guts,<br />There is so much to love in LAMANCHA; I especially loved of the completed footage that was shot for the movie. Just seconds of the film are shown and they are breath taking. It makes me sad to think I will never get to see this movie. But alas such is life.<br />The documentary does run about 15 minutes longer than it has to. I found some moments dragged on much further than they needed to. But the film is so captivating I can forgive it this one small fault.<br />I just realized how hard it is to try to review a documentary film like this. There are so many great little moments; Gilliam's eyes sparkling as he gets that first shot. His anger at NATO planes flying over head. His little laugh that I'm not quite sure was genuine after Johnny Depp (On of his actors) makes a silly observation about his character. It's so hard to paint a picture of just how interesting this movie is.character. Not only that, but they also they get mostly unfettered access to Gilliam.

B00008PX8P|5.0|In my opinion, Led Zeppelin is the greatest band of all time. John Bonham was the best rock drummer ever. No arguements. If you have any doubts, you haven't seen this dvd. I myself am a musician (electric bass) and I was thoroughly impressed by every aspect of this collection of live footage. Jimmy Page is second only to Jimi Hendrix when it comes to guitar playing, and I don't think there is or ever was a more all-around talented professional musician than the often unappreciated John Paul Jones (Bass, Keyboard, Mandolin). Also, Robert Plant (Vocals, Harmonica)does a great job live. There's this indescribable energy to them, especially in the Royal Albert Hall show. There's no band that has ever existed that can match Led Zeppelin, past or present, and anyone (especially a rock or blues musician) would enjoy these spectacular concerts.
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah Carey's 1995 disc \\"Daydream\\" marked the beginning of her peak. Fresh off the biggest record of her career, 1993's \\"Music Box\\", Carey was a certified hit-maker. It became instinctive that her singles would shoot up the charts (with good reason, for since her 1990 debut she had over ten chart-toppers to her name) and her albums would sell in bucket-loads. \\"Daydream\\" seems to capture that essence of Mariah magic. Lead-off single \\"Fantasy\\" became the first song ever by a female artist to debut at No. 1, and the follow-up \\"One Sweet Day\\", recorded with Boyz II Men, was the longest-running No. 1 hit of the '90s with sixteen consecutive weeks at the top. \\"Daydream\\" flourishes with feel-good '90s pop and bombastic ballads featuring her signature swoops, squeals, and belts befitting of her astonishing five-octave range. Sometimes it all blends together with slight moments of filler (\\"I Am Free\\", \\"When I Saw You\\") but for the most part, \\"Daydream\\" is loaded with smashes and tracks that SHOULD have been smashes. The Tom Tom Club-sampled \\"Fantasy\\" is a pleasant opener and one of the most enjoyable pop hits of the decade, while \\"Underneath The Stars\\" and \\"Always Be My Baby\\" reflect Carey's cooler, smoother side with great success. The project is held by more ballads than her previous outings, but \\"Daydream\\" is still as bright and sunny as any other great pop record of the mid-90s.
B000002PC6|5.0|Having strutted her stuff to an adoring public in Grease and survived the horror that was the film Xanadu, Olivia Newton-John released Physical and basically took over the world of music for a period of many months in 1981.  The title track was simply huge, to a degree I have seen no other song come close to equaling in the 20+ years since its release; if my memory serves me correctly, the song was number one at least ten consecutive weeks, which is really quite mind-boggling.  To some degree, the other many merits of this album are overshadowed by the title song's accomplishments.  Not only is this Olivia's best-selling album ever, though, it is also arguably her very best from top to bottom.  Make a Move on Me was a pretty big hit in and of itself, with its energy and the kind of lustful innocence only Olivia could deliver.  Another great song many listeners may remember is Landslide, the energy and catchiness of which set the tone for the entire album.  Of course, no Olivia album would be complete without a touching ballad or two.  Fallen is a slow and moving song, but the truly special and vintage Olivia love song on this album is Carried Away.  This Olivia is strong and sure of herself, though, as she more than proves in the very next track Recovery.  Actually, Love Make Me Strong, with its strong beat and passionate delivery, proves to be an even more forceful song than Recovery.  My favorite song on the album, though, is Strangers Touch due to its sizzling delivery brimming with even more passion and sultriness than the suggestive mega-hit Physical.<br />Olivia's earnest environmentalist feelings are expressed well in a couple of tracks.  Silvery Rain, an unusual but impressive track which is basically an anti-crop dusting song at heart, features an unusual sound and style which creates a strong and lasting impression on the ears of the listener.  Its somewhat subdued verses floating above assorted mystical synthesizer sounds are transformed on a dime to energetic choruses full of emotion.  Finally, there is The Promise (The Dolphin Song).  Olivia wrote this song herself in an effort to inform people about the plight of dolphins at the hands of man, and it truly is a beautiful song, especially with its background sounds of real dolphins at work and play.<br />In my opinion, there's not a bad song to be found on this album, and strangely enough the title track now seems to be overshadowed a bit by all of the impressive music surrounding it.  If you are an Olivia fan, this is definitely the album to own.ergetic choruses full of emotion.  Finally, there is The Promise (The Dolphin Song).

B00005JM09|5.0|John and Sarah Connor destroyed Cyberdyne Systems, accidentally got Myles Dyson, the man responsible for Skynet, killed, and destroyed all remaining evidence of the Terminators, all while preaching that, \\"there's no fate but what we make for ourselves\\".  Therefore, there shouldn't be a T3... or should there?  The Connors may have postponed Judgment Day, but it is inevitable.  Afterall, you can't stop progress.  The story begins with a monologue from John Connor, who reveals that, even though he should feel safe, he doesn't, so he lives completely \\"off the grid\\".  He has no credit cards, no address, no phone, and no steady job.  At the same time, Arnold's        T-800 and Kristanna Lokken's T-X appear and begin their search for John.  However, the T-X has extra files that tell her the names and locations of all of Connor's most trusted lieutenatnts, and she starts going after them when she can't find John.  Meanwhile, after getting into a motorcycle accident, John ends up in an animal clinic trying to find some some medicine.  Kate Brewster, a former fling from grade school, works at the clinic, and she, John, and the T-800 are forced to flee from the T-X.  The T-800 goes on to tell the pair about their future together, and that the new Judgment Day will occur three hours from then.  The trio sets up a mission to prevent the war, but the T-X is ready for them.  I must say that I was very pleased by this movie; it far exceeded my expectations, which were actually somewhat low.  I loved the first two movies, and I was afraid that the new director would screw everything up, but Jonathon Mostow faithfully took up the mantle that Cameron set down.  The effects are worthy of a Terminator movie, the story is great, though it is much darker than the hopeful T2: Judgment Day.  Finally, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, Lokken, and Arnold's performances are very believable.  I must commend Arnold for being able to do the things that he does at his age.  This film is wonderful, and isdefinitely worthy of the name \\"The Terminator\\".
0670451495|5.0|This is a loving tribute to Robert McCloskey, the author and illustrator of the best loved children's books, 'Make Way for Ducklings,' 'Homer Price' and 'Blueberries for Sal.' McCloskey passed away June 30, 2003 at the age of 88 at his home in Deer Isle near Portland, Maine. His books focused on family experiences, small-town life, his island home in Maine and Boston. Boston was the setting for his 1941 book, 'Make Way for Ducklings.' It's about a father and mother duck who leads their eight ducklings thorugh the busy streets of the big city. McCloskey a native of Hamilton, Ohio went to Boston in 1932 to study art when he watched some ducklings waddling through traffic. The book won a Caldecott Medal for best American children's picture book. There is also a bronze sculpture of the mother duck and her eight ducklings as a popular tourist attraction in Boston. McCloskey and his family spent summers on Scott Island in Maine, where he wrote 'Blueberries for Sal,' 'One Morning in Maine' and 'Time of Wonder.' 'Time of Wonder' won a second Caldecott Medal. McCloskey has left behind a rich legacy of stories that woven around American living and families,  like those of E.B. White and A.A. Milne. This is one of the best children's classics I'd recommend to any parent.
B000006NPY|3.0|The Pumpkins took an electronic, sometimes acoustic path when making their fourth album, Adore.  Jimmy Chamberlin, fired from the band for drug use, has been replaced by a drum machine, and the results are some beautiful songs.  To Sheila, For Martha, Ballad of Dusty and Pistol Pete, and Blank Page are some of the quiet, acoustic and piano-driven numbers; Appels+Oranjes, Pug, and Crestfallen are good examples of the album's driving, electronic songs.  Adore is definitely quite different from the rest of the Smashing Pumpkins catalog, but when one is in the mood for it, it provides more than a welcome diversion.
B000002MZ6|5.0|This is the most amazing album ever created. While it's not really indicatave of Mike's talent, you do get to hear his Guitar sing. Plus, you get to hear loops by Michael Cretu (Enigma). I've bought over 40 copies of this CD as gifts for those I love, and no one has ever had a bad word to say.
B00005JM09|4.0|I was seriously expecting this to [not be good]. No Sarah Conner, no James Cameron, no Brad Fidel (Composer). Well, the score wasn't the best, but the flick itself continues the story of the Terminator Saga. Yeah, comedy has it's own place, but the action in T3 is great. The TX? She's brutal. Whenever she appears you wonder what type of bone-crunching she's gonna pull next.  T3 isn't perfect, but it sure is a worthy flick for the money. I saw it last night, and I'd be willing to see it again!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about!  This was a MOVIE NOT THE BOOK!  There is no way in the world that the book could have been put to screen as it was written.  This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC!  Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the books too.  However, this second installment was difficult to read because of the way it was split up.  I'm sure it was difficult to put onto the screen, as there is really no beginning or ending to it.  I think Peter Jackson and his gang did a really great and inventive job of keeping the journey going, while touching on all the highlights and making us care for the characters even more.  <br />And I have to say that I'm glad they cut the adventure a little short.  I think it would have been too upsetting to end the movie with that last bit Tolkein had in the book (Shelob's lair).  <br />The first movie was supposed to introduce you to the world of Middle Earth and the characters and what it was like during this particular time in \\"history\\".  <br />This second movie is meant to let you get to know the main characters more and to make you feel more strongly for them in their horrible and desperate situation.  According to an interview I read with Peter Jackson, we were meant to feel dispair and to think that they would never accomplish their task.  That's it all hopeless.  That they are all going to perish and that evil will rule all of Middle Earth.<br />The third movie will be a joy to see.  Peter said that the third movie is a real tear jerker.  Man!  I don't see how it's possible to make it more emotional than the past two!  <br />Even though I've read the books, I don't know how Peter will show it to me.  It is so difficult to wait a whole year to see what happens next!  It will be a great day indeed when I can sit down at home and watch all 3 DVD's consecutively.  <br />Simple pleasures people!  Simple pleasures!  :^)
B00005U122|5.0|I had the good fortune of seeing this live concert twice and this DVD is as good as it gets! Great song list, great camera work and superb sound quality. Roger and band take us on a  journey through time to the very genesis of Floydian mystique, capturing the essence and soul of an extraordinary musical vision. Highly recommended.
B00005OWEG|3.0|We all know that whether or not you like it, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a landmark film.  At times I think its been slightly overrated, but it's one I would show to a film class.<br />I would not show \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" unless it were for comparison.  Except for a few new beautifully lit frames by Storaro and the French plantation scene, this version really doesn't add anything to the the film.  I liked the way Kilgore's character exited the film the first time.  We don't need to see him screaming through a megaphone to know that he's got a screw loose.  <br />The Playboy bunnies scene seemed like just a sex scene to take our attention away from what lies up the river.  There is no real meaning to it.  <br />There are added scenes in Kurtz's compound which feel quite unnecessary.<br />When are directors going to learn to leave well-enough alone?

0312305060|3.0|This book tells in alternate chapters the story of a day in the lives of three women at different times: writer Virginia Woolf struggling with her novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" in 1923, unhappy wife Laura Brown clinging to sanity by reading that same novel around 1949, and Clarissa Vaughan, a New York book editor in the present who's throwing a party just like the fictional Mrs. Dalloway. <br />Enough rave reviews have been written about this novel so that the whole world and its mother thinks it's magnificent.  I think that the author's undeniable feel for significant, character-defining details may be here mistaken for profundity.  The novel's main characters are all unhappy and dissatisfied with their lives but don't know why (except Woolf, who has a legitimate reason - she's gradually going mad).   <br />Clarissa is rich, as she tells you.  She lives in an enviable apartment in a fashionable Manhattan neighborhood.  She doesn't have a worry greater than the right choice of clothes or flowers.  Laura and her husband own a new house and a convertible; she gets to stay home and bake cakes.  Not bad for 1949.  Virginia and her husband own a small printing company so she can publish her own books.  Maybe a couple of weeks in a third world country would enlighten these women as to how privileged they are.  They are not only self-important, self-absorbed and pathologically self-preoccupied but view the people outside their charmed circle with condescension and disdain.  Clarissa walks the streets of New York noticing the ugliness and vulgarity of everyone, especially \\"foreign drivers who believe women should walk three paces behind their husbands.\\"  How sad that such lesser creatures must share the city with Clarissa and her elite crowd, people who buy $400 shirts without thinking twice and whose earth-shaking views and decisions deal mainly with where to dine and what party to attend.<br />Woolf comes across as a snobbish prig, eyeing her servants with barely controlled disgust at their stupidity and commonness.  She delights sadistically in giving them overly difficult, unnecessary tasks that are as humiliating as they are trivial.  She sees her sister as insensitive and shallow.  You feel that this Virginia is an insufferable snob, trapped in the suburbs (horror!), away from glamorous, intellectual London (where she rightfully belongs), lamenting that no one is clever or worthy enough to appreciate or understand her, the literary genius.<br />What I find most distracting and indeed insufferably irritating about this book is the author's need to make practically every character in the story gay.  Clarissa is gay and lives with Sally who is gay.  So are all the people in New York, at least those whom Clarissa knows: Richard, the AIDS-afflicted former lover for whom she's throwing the party, is gay.  Julia, her daughter by artificial insemination, is gay.  Julia's older friend Mary, is gay.  Louis, who was briefly Clarissa's lover (and then Richard's), is gay.  Walter Hardy, a writer of homosexual potboilers, is gay. He takes care of Evan, who's gay. Oliver St. Ives, famous movie star, is gay. You get the idea...<br />Those few characters who are not overtly gay have gay tendencies.  That includes Virginia (whose entire gay reputation hinges on the fact that she slept twice with Vita Sackville-West and didn't like it).  Laura has gay tendencies and her son Ritchie will grow up to be gay.  Only her husband Dan is straight and that's because he has to be shown as everything Laura wants to get away from (although he's a good person).  Eventually we expect homosexuality to be conferred on everything in the novel, including pets and inanimate objects.<br />It's as if Victor Hugo had decided that every character in \\"Notre Dame de Paris\\" had to be a hunchback or if Tolstoy had made every person in \\"Anna Karenina\\" have a scandalous extramarital affair.  Eventually it just gets too tedious.<br />Mr. Cunningham (who I'm told is gay) appears to believe that the way to validate a character's lifestyle is to make everyone else in a story share the same inclinations.  Strength does not lie in numbers but in the certainty and integrity of one's convictions.  If you're a vegetarian you don't need to fantasize that everyone else is one in order to feel that you're doing the right thing.  Furthermore, whereas the real Virginia Woolf wrote about affluent society whilst keeping a distance that allowed her to acutely question and criticize such a world (one of the things that make her a great writer), Mr. Cunningham is unable to keep any distance whatsoever from this insulated and privileged milieu because he thoroughly belongs to it and thus identifies with it.  A glossy but ultimately shallow novel, and a narcissistic work for a narcissistic time.

B00004XONN|5.0|There seems to be a mixture of 5 and 1 star ratings here, Lets put it this way, those reviews with the single star ratings prove that there is nothing wrong with the album but a lot of problems with themselves .<br />Without being insulting, this album is widely regarded as one of the most clever and therefore one of the best of all time and so it shows really who should be listening to Britney Spears and who should be listening to more talented bands such as Radiohead.<br />I can understand maybe some of the three star reviews, with some appreciation of the album. It may not be everybodies cup of tea. However almost all the professional reviewer's opinions have rated this very highly and so the people rating this low are just embarrasing themselves, showing how shallow their music tastes are and trying to take it out on this website.

0451457994|4.0|After 30 plus years this book says more in its 200 pages than much of the 600 page TOR opuses that pass as current sci-fi and which are grossly in vogue today. Unlike much of current sci-fi it speculates on mans past as well as his future. It also has something intelligent to say within the action as opposed to the hack and slash of some of the contemporary sci-fi dreck being shilled out these days. Many people are more familiar with the classic movie than the equally classic book. \\"2001\\" the book is just as great as the movie and certainly less ambiguous. It is not just a movie adaptation. <br />I think Hal is remembered too much. Maybe it's the movie's fault. He isn't the first threatening machine in sci-fi there was Robby the Robot from \\"Forbidden Planet\\" and that giant robot from \\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\". And like those movies we remember the machine more. This is unfortunate for HAL has become this ingrained pop icon for malfunctioning computers that he overshadows the hero, Bowman. Bowman is one of the classic sci-fi heroes. He is on par with Rand's Roark, Heinlein's Valentine Michael Smith and Tolkien's Aragorn. He is Clarke's Ideal Man and an inspiration for our real lives. He has a lust for life that is unafraid, committed and with a thirst for knowledge. He takes control of his own destiny despite the deepening circumstances that surround him. He literally descends into the unknown without blinking. Like Bowman don't sit idly by depending on computers to do you're thinking take control of your own destiny. Hmm...sounds like something out of the \\"Matrix\\". Some people think Clarke wrote uninteresting and underdeveloped characters, I disagree, at least with Bowman. If you think sci-fi is for teenage boys this book will change your mind.
0156027321|5.0|With greater mass appeal a rumor would probably develop that this book, when read backwards, would read \\"Paul is dead\\".  It is the type of text that evokes much passion, analysis and soul searching yet leaves one pondering the embarrassing possibility that Yann Martel is sniggering as we search for unintended depth in his brilliance as a storyteller.  <br />The life of Pi, ostensibly, tells the story of a religiously bewildered Indian boy who is named after, of all things, a swimming pool.  He ends up in a life raft with a strange and dwindling collection of animals courtesy of his zoo-keeper parent's abortive attempt to transfer the family business, via cargo ship, to the new world.   The bulk of the book dwells significantly on the relationship between Pi and a Bengall Tiger who bears the unlikely yet charming name \\"Richard Parker\\".<br />Even superficially it is a fascinating read and I became convinced that I was appraising some brilliant piece of religious satire that would become cunningly transparent at an appropriate stage.  As the pages wore on I became concerned that my rather sketchy knowledge of Indian religions would leave me hanging intellectually and I resolved, should the situation continue, to deny firmly that I had read the book.   <br />Then that ending hits you.  One sentence which sends your whole mind into a spin.  All at once the aim of the story is clarified as simultaneously its true message is lost in a jumble of conjecture and possibilities.  Even my intuitive discovery (of which I am endlessly proud) that Richard Parker was, apparently, the name of an English cabin boy cannibalized after a ship wreck, only served to fuel my bewilderment.<br />All in all a great read which I would recommend to anybody with a slight tendency to inflicting mental abuse on themselves.  Like me you can take solace in the fact that the title will attract gullible mathematicians who, courtesy of that arrogant logic they sneered at us with at school, will surely be reaching for the Tylenol.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|... Taty started out as an independent project, actually a folk project. The girls were selected from a casting four years ago, by their producer Ivan, a psychologist etc. who had nothing to do with Russian showbusiness! (not some large multinational record company). They worked for a while until they changed direction towards a pop project with lesbian tendencies. <br />They had two huge hits THEN they signed to a record company, but Ivan's own company Neformat (means something like against format) is in control of everything. Now if they were so commercial and desperate for attention, how come Taty is managed in a disasterous way from a commercial point of view? Lots of cancelled promotion; no official merchandise; it's hard to get interviews with the girls; the girls don't suck up to the media etc. Now why not have a look and read their interviews.. do these girls give you the slightest impression of being manipulated? Smart, mischiveous, excentric and very funny girls. Both girls have an 8-year classical education, and they are talented musicians. With regards to the lesbian question and their private lives in general, the girls have always been *deliberately* ambigious and vague. They are not fake lesbians - their so called lesbian image wasn't even a big issue until Western media put the label lesbian on them, and later fake-lesbian (if you don't believe me, take a look at the Russian album booklet or their video for 30 Minutes). This group is more their producer's than their own group. Since Ivan Shapovalov is an extrememely interesting and intelligent individual who loves to act against format and norms, I'm sure we can expect great things in the future too. All in all, it's hard to imagine a group that breaks so many rules of showbiz. How many of these pathetic indie bands nowadays who claim to be so independent are as uncompromising as Taty, and would dare to stand up for themselves half as much?<br />As for me, I'm not fond of commercial music and pop music in general. I prefer industrial, black/death metal, alternative, goth etc. - yet I see something different in Taty. They have something like a punk spirit; not that I'm sure many of you are able to get that. Your loss. Their album is a gem, but I much prefer the Russian version. If you want to listen to it, the whole album + a bunch of remixes can be found on their OFFICIAL Russian web site in 128kbps quality (not that many groups offer this eh?). The Russian lyrics also have a lot more depth to them than their English equivalents. It's a great thing that they kept the Russian rap in \\"Stars\\". This song isn't your average pop lyrics, and it deals with love, suicide and drugs.<br />Tatu has created themselves a universe, and it addresses, to quote NME: \\"alienation, oppression, betrayal, rejection, inhibition\\". And no, Tatu isn't for dirty old men, take a look at their audience and you'll be surprised how many young women you will find there.

B00001NFCY|2.0|Now don't get me wrong, I think that Creed is a very talented band.  They are extremely capable of putting out high quality music that can touch the innermost parts of your soul...but it comes in two very different forms.  The 2-star rating that I gave to this album doesn't come from a lack of quality, but more from a position of shock and disappointment.  After hearing the first album &quot;My Own Prison&quot; I was instantly hooked.  Scott Stapp has one of the most powerful and melodic voices in music history, and Mark Tremonti puts down some pulsing, mesmorizing guitar riffs to create an awe-inspiring masterpiece.  &quot;My Own Prison&quot; is a very heavy album, with almost all of the songs being very emotionally intense.  So when I went out to buy &quot;Human Clay&quot;, I was expecting more of the same.  But when I popped it into my CD player, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Scott's voice was coming out of the speakers, but the music was nothing like their first album at all.  It had, at most, 1/10 of the intensity and nowhere near the same raw emotion that the first CD established.  &quot;Human Clay&quot; was nowhere near what I had expected, except for the song &quot;What If&quot;, which had a few similarities to the music from &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, but the rest is much softer and toned down.  The transition from &quot;My Own Prison&quot; to &quot;Human Clay&quot; is like going from hard rock to pop rock.  Once again, let me emphasize that my 2-star rating does not represent the quality of the music, but more of the confusion I felt after realizing that Creed was going in a very different direction with their music.  Consider this review more of a warning to those of you out there who think that &quot;Human Clay&quot; (and their newest CD for that matter) is going to be just as hard hitting as the first...you're in for a rude awakening.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I had never even heard a song of John Mayers but just from looking at the cd and the song titles I could tell I'd like it. Sure enough I did, very much. They are songs you can relate to and ones to listen to all the time to clam you down or to make you really think. The only songs to complain about are City Love, and Neon. They are hard to understand and I've only listened to them about twice because of that. The rest are absolutley wonderful and I'd say it reminds of the music they play in starbucks but John Mayer is a million times too talented for that. His voice is relaxing and his guitar playing is too.
B00005JM09|5.0|I just came back from watching T3 in the theater, First let me start by telling you I was very scared to see the movie. I am A huge Terminator movie fan and after hearing that James Cameron was not the director and there is no Linda Hamilton as well as a different actor playing John Conner I was worried to say the leased. But when I saw the early previews of a female terminator I lost almost all hope of a good sequel in the trilogy. Now after seeing the movie I can tell you how it was in one clear sentence.\\"WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS THE BEST TERMINATOR MOVIE IN THE TRILOGY, PERIOD!\\" I was absolutely \\"blown away\\" by this movie or should I say ride or maybe action epic. It is one of the Best Action Movies I have ever seen. It starts big and only gets better till you get to the most satisfying ending I have ever seen. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The director and cast should be very proud of this film. Jonathan Mostow made a move that not even James Cameron could top, I love Cameron but Mostow has clamed the action thrown(if there was one). Kristanna Loken was perfect in the role' she had me totally convinced she was the TX, a flawless performance. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes also gave \\"GREAT\\" performances not to mention having great chemistry. If you like Action Movies you will love this one and if you love Action Movies you will hold this \\"Action Masterpiece\\" in your heart for years to come.  -Jason

B00000GAIW|5.0|This album is classic.  One of my favorites of all-time.  Whether it is to be considered a two-part concept album or not, the music and lyrical content is extremely rich.  Consider the brilliant title track: it starts with a powerful, driving sound with lyrics introducing Aqualung (formed by man by the \\"dust of the ground\\" and \\"cast into the void\\") as a dirty, menacing pedophile which is society's view and then, in slower, acoustical parts, Anderson's lyrics sympathize with the homeless man (\\"Do you remember December's foggy freeze\\") and takes stabs at society's treatment of men such as Aqualung.  The rest of the album is just as rich and wonderful.  The free spirited acoustical \\"Mother Goose\\" and the soothing but introspective acoustical \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" are two of my favorites.  Hard rocking numbers in the same vein as \\"Aqulaung\\" include the disturbing enjoyment of \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" (Iron Maiden did a cover of this one) and \\"Locomotive Breath\\" which, like the title track, is always included in Tull concerts.<br />Whereas the first side (or half) of the album may be seen as a criticism of society, the second side is a stab at organized religion with the heaviest tracks on the album \\"My God\\" and, especially, \\"Hymn 43.\\"  \\"Locomotive Breath\\" uses a train to symbolize the unstoppable influence of Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory on the church (\\"Old Charlie stole the handle\\").  The remarkable album ends with the acoustic \\"Wind Up\\" which sports some of the best lyrics on record (\\"He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays\\").  If you just know the two big hits and have not heard this album in its entirety, you are really missing out on something truly special.  What I do not understand about this release, however, are the choice of bonus tracks.  \\"Song for Jeffrey\\" through \\"Bouree\\" do not fit well and are, of course, available elsewhere.  I read where Glenn Cornick (former bass player) talks about playing on several original takes of Aqualung including an unreleased version of \\"My God\\" before he had to leave the band.  Where are these tracks?  Now they would be what I would consider a \\"bonus\\" on an album such as this which is almost too perfect to add something from outside.  I almost considered shaving off a star, but could not give this classic less than 5.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This cd is so much fun to listen to!  Every time I listen to it, I end up with a new favorite song!!

Give it a try!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I admit I've never really thought highly of Pink, though I never actually heard her music. Now that I have, I have immense respect for her as an artist. &quot;Family Portrait&quot; is painfully honest. It captures the feeling of someone going through a family splitting apart. It alone makes this album worthy, not to mention the other quality songs. It's not really a pleasant song to hear, but true art isn't supposed to be. (That's why we have Britney Spears.)
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is a comical genius! His books of essasys `Me Talk Pretty One Day' is one of the funniest things I've ever read. And not only is it funny, but it is also very witty. His text is so good that you don't want to put it down, because you know that in the next page there will be more laughing coming for you. Moreover, his comments about life, family and being a foreigner are very pertinent and never silly.<br />There `characters' --real life people who are related to Sedaris-- are so good that you may believe they were made up, but on the other hand, we know that there are every kind of people around, so the people in the book they do exist. My favorites are his sister Amy, Bonnie(this woman deserves a whole book about her!!), his brother Paul, aka The Rooster (and believe me You Can't Kill the Rooster!). I believe that all these people should be flatered on being in Sedaris's book, because he writes about them with such a passion, that even when he is making fun of them it is impossible to be angry with him.<br />It is hard to choose one favorite essay because they are all so good, but there are a couple of them that can be pointed out as even better. My favorites are `Picka Pocketoni' (you have to read to find out what it is!), Go Carolina, The Learning Curve, The City of Light in the Dark and Jesus Shaves. But above all, the essay title Me Talk Pretty One Day is close to perfection. Anyone who has taken a single class of a foreigner language will easily identify him/herself to the story. Everything is there: the student who can understand everything but the most important word in the sentence and is afraid of having to talk, the native teacher to whom everything is obvious, the student who knows `everything' and is only taking classes to polish his/her language --but, as a matter of fact he/she wants to snob the other ones who know less than him/her-- etc.<br />My suggestion is: after a hard day, find a confortable armchair, open this book, and have non-stop laughs. And if you read this book and don't laugh, please, go to the doctor, you must have serious problems. Enjoy it! And Congratulations, Sedaris. I'm looking forward to reading more of his writings.-stop laughs. And if you read this book and don't laugh, please, go to the doctor, you must have serious problems. Enjoy it! And Congratulations, Sedaris. I'm looking forward to reading more of his writings.
B00005JMC6|5.0|I walked in the theater with no presumptions. I didn't have much of any idea what this movie was about. I was, quite simply, amazed. This film lives almost outside the realm of movies. It's more like an emotional life-milestone. I will always remember it.

0142004235|5.0|John Steinbeck, despite past controversy, is one of America's finest novelists, fully deserving the resurgence in interest caused by The Oprah Phenomenon. It reflects the current cultural mania for 'names' that it takes such publicity to attract readers to someone who should be read anyway. Steinbeck is so much better than so many highly touted writers of today that the 'name' mania seems bizarre, inexplicable.<br />East of Eden is beautifully written in every sense--story, plot and characters. It draws the reader in from the start and demands to be read, to savor the magnificent prose and wonder at the skills of observation and exposition Steinbeck demonstrates. Some critics have suggested, over the decades since the book was first published, that the author pushed his biblical allegories too far, that Kathy was outrageous and improbable in her behavior, that the depictions of time and place were harsh and unrealistic. Those critics had clearly led simple lives and had never been exposed to actual people who behaved far worse--yes, they truly exist--or actual places where the cultural landscape was equally complex and often agony to experience.<br />It is perhaps difficult for a modern reader to adopt the attitude that would permit the comfortable assimilation of East of Eden. It is not a modern book, but this novel proves that great writing transcends time and fad, that Steinbeck was a hugely talented, powerful and fearless writer who could tackle difficult material and convey it with searing intensity.<br />I have re-read this book many times and remain in awe at how powerful and memorable it is. Having read, perhaps, 25,000 or more books in my life, I rate this among the top 10 and find it magnificent in every way.
B00005JM09|4.0|There was little doubt that the movie was not going to live up to excellence of the second one.  When I went in I hoped that it could at least live up to the first film.  In that manner it did, in other ways I was a little let down.<br />The plot of Terminator 3 is that John Connor (Nick Stahl) has been on the run since after the events of the second film.  In the ten years that have passed Sarah Connor has died of Lukemia and the construction of Sky Net was post poned.  Insted of 1997 when the Nuclear war started it was delayed to 2003.<br />Once again a Terminator was sent back in time to assassinate John Connor, but this time the Terminatrix (the new model) has other objectives as well.  Since John Connor has been clever enough to basically erase himself Skynet programed the T-X to also assassinate his leutenants.  Arnold returns as the way outdated T100 to stop the new menace and save John Connor and one of his leutenants Kathryn (Claire Danes).  The end result is that there is a lot of action explosions and car chases, and we even get to see the T1, the man made Terminator and first model.<br />The weird thing about this movie is that it will leave one of three impressions on the audience.  When I left everyone was silent as if deep in thought, because like the previouse two there was not the happy ending, but still one that inspired hope.  The impressions this will leave on the audience is as followed.<br />1: Total Disgust<br />2: Squeeling teenage boy who thinks it's the coolest thing<br />3: Deep in thought and intrigued as to where they can take this.<br />It's worth seeing, but if you expect it to be like #2 than you will end up being like person 1.  However The movie is good, not excellent like it should be.
0739302043|5.0|Just the type of book I like.  Action, interspersed with little known bits of  information that makes the book flow.  In fact, it is probably the best book I have read this year.  A real, hard-to-put-down winner.<br />I would guess the author's exposure of the secret Catholic Church cult, Opus Dei, among whose prominent members include FBI traitor Robert Hanssen and ex-director Luis Freeh will bring on the wrath of some Cathholic readers.  His approach to the super-secret church Canon Laws is both intriguing and fascinating.  A warning, however.  Once you start, it is impossible to put down.

Comedy of errors ensues, we're walking<br />in NYC on the coldest day of 2000, I have pneumonia, she's<br />mad at me... and yet, pianist Christopher Barrett plays the<br />music, I sing it at Churrascaria Plantation, and get down on<br />one knee to say, &quot;Eu gostaria de pedir a sua mao em casamento.&quot;<br />To which she replies, &quot;You've got to be kidding me.&quot;<br />We're still happily married to this day.

B000092ZYY|5.0|As I sat listening to Hail To The Thief with my one day old baby sleeping peacefully on my lap I realized how impossible it is for an album to get an A+ grade from me--but it only ever has to do it once. It has to peak early on and never let up for the duration, with only the narrowest leeway for each second of sound. Knowing this in the middle of \\"Sit Down, Stand Up,\\" by the time Thom got lost in the raindrops I was convinced I needed to put this album under a magnifying glass. And you know what, it held up. With songs like \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" as the bookends, you're going to need a pretty magnificent library in between to keep the listener from feeling cheated a bit. So each song is crafted from pure emotion to perfectly compliment it's neighbors and at the same time be it's own unique and distinct self--the sequencing is perfect. Tracks 1-4 drift slowly from Ok Computer to Amnesiac and just before you're let loose into infinite space \\"Go To Sleep\\" grounds you The Bends style with guitars going full boar. Then you swiftly transition to a beautiful mix of computer and instrumental sounds through the A-Side until on \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" some of the guitar notes begin to sound like bleeps and blips.<br />You are then given a couple of second pause before \\"The Gloaming\\" completely changes the pace for the B-Side. The most difficult transition on the album, it can also be the most rewarding as the measured precision of these tracks only adds to their beauty. It's everything from this point on that sounds more like a new direction than the compactly compiled greatest moments of the first seven. From Thom seemingly singing a duet with himself on \\"I Will\\" to the amazing structure and clarity of \\"A Wolf At The Door\\"--and, of course, everything punched up in between--the heart monitor rides the roof here at the albums close. You're so alive now it's dangerous. If this is the only time Hail To The Thief sounds this good to me, it's the only one it needs to. There's something about an album you and your newborn can find equally soothing at the same time. you've got to admit that. Forget about the press and what they say about your titles Mr. York, we love your *music* and EPs don't give you the proper amount of space to craft the masterpieces we desire. But on the other hand, an album balanced like this could perfectly mark the end of one era and the beginning of a new.

B0000027G6|5.0|The title above refers to Barry's other award-winner, the score to &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. In this, the soundtrack to Costner's epic, Barry chose to forego the typical melodies/themes associated with a &quot;sagebrush saga&quot; and focused instead on the romantic feel of the Old West. His music is alternately panoramic and subtle, blaring and subdued, all when it is needed.<br />Those familiar with his work will, undoubtedly, hear some similarities with his work on the Bond films.  But, that is to be expected.<br />Bond, like the American West, is &quot;bigger than life&quot; and this soundtrack is the perfect tribute.
1400031346|2.0|The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency was a classic weekend read. Both the prose and the plot are quite simple. The several cases she solves are also simple and very predictable. This is the kind of book you take to the beach and finish it in no time. This is definitely not the kind of book you ponder and re-read. The good things about this book are the characters and the exotic setting of Botswana. It made me aware of how little I know about Africa and made me want to educate myself about Africa. The main character, Precious Ramotswe is pleasant and resourceful (large and warm like Africa). The other characters are also straightforward and somewhat memorable. However, I struggle the fact that this book is on the New York Times Best Seller list. I recommend Helen Fielding's (Yes, the author of Bridget Jones' Diary)Cause Celeb.
B000099T2L|5.0|Wassup Yall, I am always on CDNOW.com (amazon) to see the latest music and stuff, and i felt COMPELLED to tell yall about this beautiful work of art also known as \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" Beyonce's first Solo effort. I took the time to read all 109 reviews to see what yall thought...and now here is my take on things, track by track. I can't wait, yall.. You probably don't understand how monumental this is! I actually purchased this cd. Aight:<br />1. Crazy In Love - 4/5 ft. Ya Boy, HOV... this song, well I like it- It is played too much on the radio, nonetheless its classic. I like the Retro beat, and i like the vocals. Great to dance to.<br />2. Naughty Girl - 3/5 Not my favorite song, but I guess its cool... I like the beginning and the chorus, but it feels like something is missing.<br />3. Baby Boy - 5/5 One of my JAMZ sean paul makes it that much titghter... I love the chorus and the first verse especially..I just wish I could understand SP. Othawise this joint is off the hook and I think it will be released as a single. \\"Oh na na na\\"<br />4. Hop Hop Star - 2/5 I'll just give this song time to grow on me. More rapping than Beyonce... Beat can b tight at times, and she sings in such a sexy way, the chorus is OK. moving along<br />5. Rather Be with You - 5/5 This is THE slow jam perfect for you and Your BOO. I like this song, I know ive heard it somewhere..but its jus so hot!! Its like she is singing to you. I'm not usually one for slow songs but this one..<br />6. Me, Myself & I - 4/5 - As another reviewer mentioned, this does remind one of a DC song. It is still great though, somewhat slower song (but that is this albums' pace) and the lyrics...keep it real.<br />7. Yes - 6/5 Beautiful..ovbiously the song's subject is stressful..otherwise this song is the best on the album in my opinion. I could listen to it over and over. Its also to see a positive role model for abstinence! Haha.<br />8. Signs ft. Missy Elliott 4/5 - Missy Is myu girl and her beats are always tight, but this one doesnt stand out in particular as one of Missy's beats. I love the reverse talking, its off the hook.. songs about Astrology are becoming the norm and its kind of repetitive, but its still aight. Coulda had a longer shout out to the Geminis ;) Anybody else notice that JAY Z is a saggitarius?<br />9. Speechless - 2/5 - I see a lot of the reviewers like this song a lot, but I'm not necessarily feeling it<br />10. That's How You Like It (Feat. Jay-Z) -3/5 - again, It will grow on me, but It feels too pop=ish to me... Its still a great infatuation (Didnt want to say love; souunds more like an obsession ha) song!<br />11. The Closer I get to you - 4/5 - Beyonce can even hold it down and make older classics hype, working with Luther Im sure was a blast...shoulds how versatile Beyonce can be. I mean, can you imagine britney Spears attemtping this? Nice Slow Jam. <br />12. Dangerously In Love - 5/5 - I love this song. I loved it the first time they did it too...? I dont udnerstand, I could have sworn she'd pretty much sung the whole song on the DC album but its still tight.<br />13. ~ Interlude ~...\\"Yesterday, I tried to paint you, but the colors werent beautiful enough...\\"<br />14. Gift from Virgo- 2/5. I like the CD's slow pace but it went from slow to ssssssssssssslow...this song, has a jas effect but I dont knwo if I can sit through it every time from beginning to end. I like the old - old school beats though.<br />15. Work it out - 4/5 - From the Austin Power's soundtrack. Reminds me of Crazy in Love because of the jazzy/Horns beat...<br />16. Bonnie & Clyde '03 - 5/5 - This was my jam when it first came out. Wow, HOV sure does has made his imprint on this album...<br />17. I can't Take no More - bonus Internet track - 4/5 - Haters beware! She lets yall know she is better than all that immature mess! Nice way to finish the album.<br />Well, this album is def off the hook. I guess tahts why it went to number one selling 300,000 copies right?
006016848X|5.0|As all married people know.. there are times when your spouse just completely makes NO sense.  That's why I really love this book.. it reminds me that men and women ARE different.. and that's ok!  It provides insight into why your spouse comforts you differently than you do for them.. listens differently.. interacts with your friends differently.  We're different.  This actually was my second purchase of the book.. lent the first to a friend who was having problems in her marriage.  I like to underline the parts that mean the most to me and sit down with my husband and read them to him.  That way he can get the benefits of the book without having to read the whole thing, and it gives us the opportunity to discuss the parts that I find important.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love this CD. I bought it about three months ago. I love Latin music and Shakira delivers. My favorite song is &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;. It has an addictive, pulsating Middle Eastern beat that will get you dancing in no time. You have to get this one, people.
B00000K3D4|5.0|According to my parents, this is the only movie I would sit and watch when I was a baby. Now I'm 13, and I'm still loving it. I have the VHS, but I think it's as good as it needs to be. David Bowie wasn't even their first choice for the part he played, but seeing anyone else trying to take up the role now would seem highly unnecessary. As a kid, I enjoyed seeing the creatures. As a pre-teen, I enjoyed the creatures and the songs. As a teen, I enjoyed the creatures, the songs, and the special effects (OK, so we've improved over the years, but honestly, for the time, that's great!). If you don't own this, you need to get in touch with your inner-wallet or something. Buy it. Go. Now.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|This is one of the best albums to be released over the past few years. Ryan really struck gold(excuse the pun) with this album, the album he was always capable of making. There is a constant fresh and timeless sound to this album and will be looked back on in years to come as a classic- it will never lose its freshness.<BR>          Ryan brilliantly combines his amazing talents as both a country and rock(NOT 'country rock') singer songwriter. Of the mellow acoustic tracks, 'La cienage smile' is amazing, moody and sad, firecracker is nothing short of genius with Ryan showing brilliant flexibility in his vocals. 'Somehow Someday' is lovely and original. <BR>                       Of the Rock Tracks, 'Enemy Fire' stands out with Ryan using his Kurt Cobain scratched vocals to brilliant effect. 'Nobody Girl' is an emotional nine minute epic and is hard to come down after. 'Tino Toledo's street walkin blues' has a brilliant electric riff and smells of US street life- incredible. <BR>                        In conclusion this is as a fine album you are going to hear in your life with its honesty, heartbreak, Lou Reed style street commentary, Springsteen styled rockin and patriotism and mysterious Adams' own recipes. Buy now and enjoy.
0385504209|5.0|I read 2 good books recently; I couldn't put either down. One fiction, one non-fiction. This, obviously, is the great work of fiction; the great work of non-fiction is Make Every Girl Want You by John Fate and Steve Reil. Dan Brown's book had me mesmerized. I love the way art, another passion of mine, is intertwined in this novel. Mr. Brown is a genius the way he developed \\"hidden\\" clues in the work of Mr. Da Vinci! Clues that anyone could hypothetically see, but hidden by Da Vinci. I also am a religious man, and love how Brown weaved Jesus, Mary, and the holy grail throughout the book. The book was a fast read, and I couldn't put it down. Excellent combination of religion, suspense, &amp; mystery! Kudos to Dan Brown!
B000084T18|3.0|This album grabs your attention right away with hard, fresh lyrics and amazing beats by Dre and Eminem.  It isnt one that you will play forever such as Illmatic (which still resides in my CD player) as the overall content is repetitive and the lyrics are weak compared to alot of stuff thats coming out today. If you want something to bounce to in your car and keep your head spinning for about a month, this is definitely a good CD. I would recommend for real hip-hop fans to go and find some of his early G-Unit stuff (Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks are better than their group-leader, 50). Buy this.<br />And for anyone who isnt a fan of rap music, STOP REVEIWING RAP CD's. you just sound stupid. Who cares what an Evanescence fan thinks about 50 cent? you dont hear me though...

Personally, I like all of their material, this album being no exception. There are no bad songs on this CD. Anthony Kiedis' voice is richer than ever before and the lyrics are wonderfully cryptic as always ..Combined with the uber-talented John Frusciante, Chad Smith and Flea... Anthony and his Peppers can do no wrong. <BR>By The Way is well worth a listen and then some.

0788812408|5.0|This was an excellent movie. Not only for kids but for adults as well. Ariel captures your heart in this film. From romance forbidden by her father to breathtaking thrills, this movie is for the young and the young at heart. A mermaid princess called Ariel falls in love with a human when she saves him from a sinking ship but is forbidden to see him. As a result of not obeying her father, she gets trapped in the tricky deal of the sea witch. She will turn Ariel into a human for 3 days but she has to get the prince to kiss her. If not, she will become the property of the sea witch herself! There's another catch, she will do it without her voice. When she agrees and is human, she finds the prince and is invited to his castle. She stays there and is this close from kissing him but the sea witch intrudes and it doesn't happen. Although the sea witch has put off the kissing, she is worried he'll still kiss her by the sunset of the third day so she disguises herself as the Prince's rescuer that he's been looking for. He falls into a trance of the sea witch and is planning to marry her on a boat cruise. But Ariel's animal friends come to the rescue and stall the wedding. Mean while Ariel is swimming her hardest to get to the wedding in time. She gets their and gets back her voice. The Prince then comes out of his trance and kisses Ariel. But it was too late. It was sunset. So the sea witch takes her back to the sea. But the prince is not giving up that easily. He fights the sea witch and finally stabs her with his boat. But there's one problem. Ariel is still a mermaid. So her father finally realizes that she is in love and turns her into a human. They have a beautiful wedding and live happily ever after. It's a wonderful film and I recommend it to everyone, young and old.
0393057658|5.0|While Lewis may be at times guilty of, hmm, polishing Beane's buttocks, this book is superb.  Those who have stared at collumns of statistics for hours on end will appreciate the approach taken by the A's front office in evaluating the efficiency of baseball offense. The problem, for fans like me, is that the approach taken diminishes--and actually eschews--some really exiting aspects of run production: stolen bases and aggressive baserunning.  OH, and defense, too.  Contemporary baseball is full of too many guys continually swinging for the fences, and if too many more GM's adopt the approach Beane has taken, all we'll see is walks and three-run homers.  <br />But, all in all, the text is superb and Lewis really makes the subject matter interesting.  Of course, I love baseball so perhaps I'm biased on that point.<br />However, the really interesting thing is that the book isn't really about baseball: it is about exploiting market inefficiencies to gain a comparative advantage at minimal risk/costs.  Still, it makes for a great read for anyone confused as to why the A's can keep losing great talent and still keep putting a pretty competitive team out on the field.  <br />Big market owners, beware!
B00005JL5S|4.0|I know it hasn't opened here yet but I've had the priveledge to see it on dvd(import). It is very funny. The moves are so outrages you can't help laugh.

B00005JLT5|5.0|When Adrien Brody received the Academy Award for best actor in a leading role earlier this year, I was at first surprised. (I had expected Daniel Day-Lewis to be elected because of his incandescent portrayal of William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Cutting in Gangs of New York.) Then I began to think again about The Pianist and realized that Brody's character -- Wladyslaw Szpilman --  was the focal point of that film from beginning to end...and that most of his portrayal was non-verbal. (Some may assert that the Warsaw Ghetto, not Szpilman, is the main character. They have a point.) Directed by Roman Polanski who also won an Academy Award -- as best director -- and deservedly so, this film examines a five-year period during World War Two when Warsaw was invaded and occupied by German and then Allied forces.<br />For me, the defining moment in this film occurs when a bomb exploding in the studio drives Szpilman from the piano and ends the broadcast of his performance. His obsession with creating art seems to exclude from his consciousness any deep concern about his family (parents, two sisters, and a brother) or about the brutalities amidst German occupation, especially in response to Jewish resistance. I have not read Szpilman's memoirs, first published as Death of a City (1946) and then as The Pianist (1998). All I know about him is based entirely on Brody's portrayal in the film. This detachment from the world around him is evident again later, as when Szpilman, in hiding, silently moves his fingers across a piano keyboard, lost in the creation of music only he can hear in that situation but which the film's soundtrack effectively provides.<br />Polanksi's film obviously celebrates human survival during one of history's worst periods. I realize that comparisons and contrasts of Szpilman with other characters in other films is probably a fool's errand. However, at the conclusion of the The Pianist, I thought about Sol Nazerman (played by Rod Steiger) in The Pawnbroker (1964) who, at that film's conclusion, unleashes a silent scream of unspeakable pain. For whatever reasons, there is no such indication that what Szpilman has observed (if not experienced) has similarly affected him. The war ends. Life continues. Szpilman's career resumes. Perhaps, just perhaps Szpilman's own emotions can only be expressed through the creation of great art. It remains for others to express theirs in other ways, perhaps with a silent scream.who, at that film's conclusion, unleashes a silent scream of unspeakable pain.

B00005JM03|3.0|Urbanites who spend half their waking hours stuck in non-stop traffic jams may get a kick out of \\"The Italian Job,\\" in which one of the characters finds a way to bring almost the entire metropolitan LA area to a gridlocked standstill.<br />The film, a remake of a 1969 vehicle starring Michael Caine, is an entertaining caper tale that provides all the elements we expect to find in a film of this sort: the elaborate heists, the high tech gadgetry, the inevitable double crosses and the benevolent thieves who would give Mother Teresa a run for her money in the pure-of-heart sweepstakes.  The story begins in Venice, Italy, where a cadre of thieving buddies, under the tutelage of one Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), pulls off an amazing heist of some gold bars valued at $35 million.  But before any of the guys have had a chance to even cash in and enjoy their stake, they are betrayed by one of their own - Steve, played by Edward Norton - who kills their mentor, the beloved John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and leaves the rest of the gang for dead in a near-frozen river in the snowy Alps.  A year later, thawed out and not a little peeved at the turn of events, Charlie and the rest of the crew discover Steve's whereabouts in Los Angeles and plot out an enormously complicated scheme to exact their revenge - more for their slain buddy, of course, than for the gold itself.<br />The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, but \\"The Italian Job\\" boasts enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time.  The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict inherent in the narrative setup.  We want to see more confrontation scenes between the \\"good\\" thieves and the one \\"bad\\" one, but Steve rarely spends any screen time confronting his pursuers.  That's why the best scene by far is one that occurs in a restaurant when the antagonists DO actually square off against each other fact to face.  The overall lack of interaction between these two forces might have been less noticeable and detrimental had the filmmakers come up with any internecine conflicts among Charlie and the other members of his brigade.  Instead, these guys all get along so swimmingly with one another that all we are really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they play themselves out.  The men have no disagreements, no differences of opinion and no conflicts of interest within their happy little group, a defect in the screenplay which robs the film of some of the tension it might otherwise have had.<br />Still, \\"The Italian Job\\" is a smooth, fairly standard, fairly enjoyable little time waster with a few good chases both on land and sea, some deft acting and a smattering of amusing one-liners to keep us from walking out of the theater.  That one forgets the movie the minute one leaves the theatre is pretty much par for the course for this genre anyway.ct to face.

B00006RCPM|4.0|Expectations can shape one's approach to a movie.  Previews and the vhs cover gave the impression viewers were in for an action Sci-Fi adventure.  Instead, a tense tapestry of intrigue, emotions and--dare I say it--philosopy unfolded.  <br />The acting was subtle, yet crisp and often poignant.  The plot, though not complicated, was not obvious either.  Some guessed correctly &quot;who done it&quot; prior to the end, but the story's end was not a foregone conclusion.<br />The technical effects and atmosphere balanced well.  It was not difficult to believe that 50 years into the future might look as Spielberg painted it.  Likewise, while a tense and somewhat dark ambience pervaded the film, the effect was neither oppressive nor distracting.<br />Bottom line:  Minority Report offers drama, intrigue, great acting, and much to ponder.  A little more action would have pushed this production up to five stars.

B00005M91K|5.0|Set to the music of ethnic chants and indigenous instruments from around the world, this film will compel you to see the world in a new light. You'll see beautiful vistas of terraced paddy fields, deserts, and city scapes. You'll see the dances of the aboriginees, african tribes, and amazon Indians. You'll see the faithful praying in places of worship that range from the Vatican to the shores of Ganges. In short you'll see how similar we all are beneath our different wardrobes and languages and faiths.   <br />The score to the movie complements the scenes and intensifies the emotions one feels watching the movie. Particularly haunting are the scenes of burning oil fields in Kuwait set to the music of Scottish bagpipes, Tibetan water music, and Japanese drumming.<br />The movie explores love, faith, joy, war, death, rebirth and circle of life by showing scenes from around the world for each of these topics. Each time I have watched this movie I find myself discovering more of its hidden meanings. I think each viewer will come out with his own feelings and interpretations. But even if one isn't inclined to be philosophical, the music and cinematography alone is worth getting the DVD.
B00005JM09|5.0|Well, since i was a sprite 19 years old when the last Terminator movie came out (And i was 12 when the first one came out), it seems that these terminator movies coincide with different phases of my life!  I'm now 30 and I left my son at home with his mom to see this sequel.  <br />And guess what?  This movie ROCKS.  I went into it with no expectations (I mean, I thought that the Ride at Universal Studios was the \\"Sequel\\" to T2... talk about profiteering!) and, voila, came out ENTHUSED at what a great movie this was.  Sure, the franchise was dead and buried.... but what a great resurrection.<br />I won't give away any important plot points, but i will say that the ending is anything BUT the ending I expected when I walked in.  I hope you all enjoy the movie!
B00006879E|5.0|I bought Maroon 5's CD &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; after seeing them co-headline a show with Jason Mraz, my favorite artist, and I was blown away with them. From the first song in their set, you could tell they were a truly original band. Their CD starts with their latest single, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, which has an addictive hook and an a great bass line. It then goes into &quot;This Love&quot;, their first single off the CD, which features great vocals from lead singer Adam Levine. The rest of the CD features a mix of musical styles that are brought together with the band's original and poignant lyrics. I love this CD and have yet to take it out of my CD player since I bought it. A great album and I reccomend it to everyone.

B0000009TK|5.0|The 1988 Zappa band doing a lot of what they did best - instrumentals that allow for a lot of unusual improvisation.<BR>What is there to say that other reviewers haven't said already? <BR>A few useful facts - &quot;When Yuppies Go To Hell&quot; is a medley (of sorts) combining the tune also known as `The Dessicated Number' with improvisatory moments from at least five different shows. &quot;Big Swifty&quot; incorporates the infamous `Readers Digest' Medley of well-known classical themes. &quot;Star Wars Won't Work&quot; is an odd guitar solo originally bolted onto a rendition of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. &quot;Dupree's Paradise&quot; is the one and only version on this tour where Zappa &quot;took the tune outside&quot; (excuse me, that's jazz-speak for &quot;added some far-out collective improvisation&quot;). The Stravinsky/Bartok medley doesn't appear on all pressings of the album - make sure your copy has it. <BR>And at last, some opinions. &quot;Black Napkins&quot; benefits from having no guitar solo, there's no way Zappa could follow Walt Fowler and Albert Wing's contributions. &quot;The Black Page&quot; gets the most imaginative arrangement since '76. &quot;Sinister Footwear 2&quot; is arguably the definitive version - no synthesizer arpeggio, no inappropriate guitar solo, just the horns in all their glory. &quot;Cruising for Burgers&quot; is also a best-ever arrangement, and &quot;Strictly Genteel&quot; is nearly the best (there's the vocal version to consider).

The messages in the songs are mostly derived from the eastern Religions (Hinduism), and are just so well written and profound that it simply innihilates everything else.<br />This is the only album I can think of that actually changed my life. The lyrics are just so meaningful and beautiful and the musicianship of the brilliant band members takes you to levels other bands haven't even touched. It's that kind of album where you can listen to over and over again and still find something new, and even though it might take a while to completely sink in, if you wait it out, the loving emrace will see you through.
B000000H5K|4.0|Sepultura did it again..Roots is an awesome CD with gut renching songs mixed with metal,tribal,and a style only  few bands have accomplished. Max Cavalera's(Soulfly)vocals in the album are amazing the song 'Roots Bloody Roots&quot; and &quot;Rtamahatta&quot;are very good songs, also on the song &quot;LookAway&quot; Jonathan Davis from Korn and DJ Leathal from Limp Bizkit appear on this track.
B000002UKS|5.0|Let me start off by saying that all of the parts of this album added together do not equal up to the whole. This is definately worth buying, because every song is good, and they all supplement each other. Rarely is an album released that is innovative, professional, and commercially succussful all at once. It seems that a different approach is made at writing every song, which shows the maturity of the group. There are too many bands nowadays whose songs all sound the same. This was a true album effort on the part of the Foo Fighters and Gil Norton, the producer. It is safe to say that Dave Grohl was the mastermind behind it all, taking a big part in writing most of the songs and three of them alone. This album is filled with emotion!!! YOu have probably heard the radio hits Everlong, Monkey Wrench, and My Hero - At least one of which has probably motivated you to think about buying it at first. <br />for the musically informed:<BR>Songwriters will appreciate this more than i could express. Dave Grohl puts so much ingenuity and creativity into The Colour and the Shape, and still manages to make it explosive and full of emotion. As a friend of mine says, no songs are better than the ones in which you can feel the emotion of the singer (like there is more to the music than just the music). Grohl basically scraps the hard-rock formula and \\"rules\\" of songwriting. As I stated before, a different approach is taken to every song. If you're not bored of traditional songs then this album is great, btu if you want to hear something different, it will BLOW YOU RIGHT OUT OF YOUR SHOES! For example, the bridge of \\"February Stars\\" doesnt come in until far into the song, and the song ends on it. But get this: the hook to the song, and the name of the song, are in the bridge! It may not even be considered the bridge, but perhaps on outro. Then, the song \\"New Way Home\\" has almost no recognizable structure. \\"Doll\\" is pretty much an intro to the album. It is slow-tempoed song with exotic chords and chord changes. It is not a full song in the sense that it doesnt have a bridge, just simply a couple verses and choruses. Monkey Wrench is a hard song and probably the biggest single off this album. One thing that impressed me about the songs on this album is that not only do the verse and choruses of the songs make sense, but so do the bridges. Keys, chord progressions, tempo, etcetera are all played with by the Foo Fighters. Every song has something that breaks \\"rules\\" and tests limits, but I won't feel liek covering it all like a lot of people do on this website --- I could go on for hours disecting and evaluating the songs of this album. If you are intested, do it yourself. (highly suggested)
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I saw a portion of this concert tour on TV and decided to buy this CD.  This is the best album I have heard in a long time, including Norah Jones' Come Away With Me. <BR> <BR>Sade plays her voice like a saxophone and in fact on several songs there is a very exciting interplay between her vocals and the saxophone.  The instrumentals are so good they could even stand alone, but working tightly with Sade they are great.  I liked this CD much better than her studio albums.  In fact, I'm going to buy a DVD player so I can get the DVD of the concert.<br />The only criticism is the abrupt transition of audience reaction between songs.  It would have been better is this was smoothed out.
B00006LWSF|3.0|The Best Tracks:<BR>Lose Yourself (Eminem) - 9/10<BR>Love Me (Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice) - 7/10<BR>8 Mile (Eminem) - 9/10<BR>Rap Game (D12) - 9/10<BR>8 Miles And Runnin (Jay Z, Freeway) - 8/10<BR>Wanksta (50 Cent) - 9/10<BR>Rabbit Run (Eminem) - 10/10<br />An alright soundtrack, buy it for just the artists above.<BR>Overall - 8.9/10
B00003CXAT|5.0|This movie is awsome!!!!, defenetly among my five favorites movies of all time, and what is not to like?, suspense, action, humor and most important of all reallistyc dinosaurs.<BR>When I saw the trailer I thought that the movie was not going to be good, and man was I wrong?, its entretaining, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.<BR>The special effects are the best, thats why they got the Academy Award on that category.<BR>Dr. Allan Grant is an unusuall hero, since he doesnt have big muscles or guns, just intellect and good intentions.<BR>Dr. Ellie Saddler is an outgoing lady, very sure of herself.<BR>John Hammond looks like Santa Claus with a cane, he has good intentions, but never takes into consideration the cosecuenses of his actions.<BR>Ian Malcom is a funny geek that no one understands or likes, but as crazy as he looks, its not strange to find out that hes right most of the time.<BR>Gennaro, maybe not the best portrait of a lawyer, but you will laugh every time you see him.<BR>Dennis Nerdi, there is someone like him in every office, not ecxactly the kind of villian that you expect in a movie, thats what makes him originall and fresh.<BR>The Kids, trouble always seems to fallow them, and Vecoliraptors too.<BR>Mr. Arnold, he smokes to much. <BR>So intresting caracters, a lost island and dinosaurs out of controll made this movie a must see.
0151008116|5.0|This book has been sitting on my my desk for three months.   I was busy reading other books.  Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.   A very imaginative and enthralling read.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is back and better than ever. She shows us the real her and I like it a lot.The songs are great and her voice still rocks. I don't like the intro to the album but after that everything is great. She trade her r&amp;b style for more of a rock sound and I like it. I have been waiting for this album and it was worth the waite. She is just one of the rare artist kinda like Pink I think. She even has a spirtral song called Soar which is my favorite song off the album. Go get the album everyone is raving about now!
B000002KB8|5.0|I first heard this when my dad played it for me on vinyl when i was about 8. I thought it sounded sort of cool. Then as i got older i started reall getting into sabbath, and this is where you should start. If you occasionally enjoy the consumption of cannabis, try listening to N.I.B. while you're messed up. You'll never be the same.
B00005JLT5|5.0|It was so strong with love and human goodness. It leaves one filled with optimism in the light of the one of the worst tradgedies of all time.
B00005JM09|4.0|I just saw Terminator 3 last night.  Like most others, I din't have the highest hopes for this movie.  I saw it anyway, and all I said after the movie ended was, \\"wow\\".  This movie is great in every way.  In fact, it is nearly as good as T2.  Definately see this movie.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is it's kind of short.  Spanning only 100-110 minutes, this movie just seems like it could had been longer.  Otherwise, this movie is great, and I cannot imagine the terminator series without it.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This DVD comes with an incredible amount of extras for a long movie.  I especially enjoyed the interview with Ben Kingsley and the newsreel footage of Ghandi's travels.  The audio and video quality is top notch.  The package is worthy of such a great film.<br />I can't praise this DVD enough!
B00005JKN9|3.0|This movie fell short for me. I think Leonardo is horribly miscast in the film. Lewis is incredible though. what an amazing performance. It may be worth watching just to see his talented and emotional creation. I think diaz and Dicaprio were both bad choices. And many of the scenes were over-done and pointless, and what was up with the costumes? were the outfits really that corny back then? I was reminded of when Marty Mcfly went back to the old west in a pink outfit. In the end, rent this movie to see \\"The Butcher\\": an amazing character.
B000069AUI|4.0|I was born in the good old days, listening to the old Pink Floyd, the old Alan Parsons, all the good old stuff from the late '60s to late '70s (including The Who, The Doors, Lynard Skynard, Velvet Underground, etc). Yes, from a tender age my brain circuit was already modeled with that music, probably even since I was a fetus (as I recall now). At that time there was little electronics, no MTV, pretty faces didn't matter, lyrics was important, music was important,...it was the real stuff. There was no band in the entire 80s and 90s able to get even close to the golden age. With two exceptions: Nick Cave (and his great band that includes musicians of the caliber of Harvey and Bargeld, for example) and now Coldplay. Enough said. Worth listening and exploring, but I only give 3.1415 starts to this album. It contains one of the best songs of the last years (A Rush of Blood to the Head) but, unfortunately, it is not a conceptual album. Each song is an independent entity, disjointed and without a common motive; three minutes and move on (that is pretty simple-minded and in the spirit of the Backstreet Boys). However I REALLY think this band is in the good track, but not quiet there yet. They are young guys in an age where marketing is everything and I really hope they will not feel the pressure to sell. I think that they will arrive at the land of the masters, a matter of time if they don't get corrupted.
B000002H97|1.0|The Early 90's were a horrible time for music, we saw the death of so many bands that once had something to say, but decided that money was more important.  I couldn't believe this piece of garbage when I first heard it.  Childrens nursery rhymes: Great.  Metal died in 1991.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I think that Harry Potter is a great book and or movie for kids to read. It really lets them imagine what happens. Harry potter is also based on an Irish folk tale. I enjoy reading Harry Potter. Theres always somthing new to find out about his life and his school.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. This album has everything from pounding beats to smooth acoustic guitars. Jack White's songwriting is brilliant and Meg's drum is the kind of simple beat most bands dont have. So go out and buy this album damn it!
B00005JKN9|2.0|The rave reviews of THE GANGS OF NEW YORK make me feel as though I missed something. But in electing to wait until this noisy mess of a film came out on DVD I was able to watch it without the star-influenced clutter of a movie house screening.  Martin Scorsese has made some fine films, but this overstuffed, empty attempt at producing an epic in the form of Grand Old Hollywood days is so full of errors, fake fighting, overblown and overstated scenic clutter, and just plain phoniness that it is hard to stay with it. The constant background music of Irish tunes is distracting, the acting is stagey and, with the exception of Danien Day-Lewis, is miscast.  Perhaps someone thought that putting big names like DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz might help this treacly plot, but it only shows their relative lack of resources.  This is an overlong, tired movie, recommended only for those in need of a somnolent.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Yes, I am a Zep fan, and, yes, I DO like the incredible How the West Was Won CD set an awful lot. This deserves far more than ten stars, but that number isn't available. I DO, however, have a word or two to say about the negative reviews!! LISTEN FOR YOURSELF! Don't depend on others to form YOUR opinions!!<br />... <br />This is one of the finest examples of Jimmy Page, at his very, very most clean, fast, innovative, brilliant, and the band at the top of their form. The entire band is very tight, there is very little audience noise, the stereo is very well defined, and, in fact, I found much of the claims of the above to be  without merit, if not totally fictitious. Page literally SCORCHES the fretboard on Since I Been Lovin' You. He is devastatingly great. How anyone in good conscience, can say THIS is out of tune, sloppy guitar work, or dull, strikes me as sheer mean-ness and vituperative jealousy. <br />HOW do I know this? I used to be a guitarist. A fairly good one, too. Two of my bands toured. My whole family is musically inclined. I KNOW music. Inside and outside. I KNOW guitar, and how difficult it is to play, especially when you're not watching every note you play. It's REAL EASY to get every note perfect when you watch. Heck, I can STILL do that. It's how much incredible stuff you can do when you AREN'T watching your frets that really matters, if you're a pro. Page doesn't bother to look 3/4 of the time. And he still hits 98% of his licks. THAT is incredible.<br />My favorites? How The West's Highlights are MANY. Besides the whole work, I highly recommend Immigrant Song, a blisteringly good version of it too, combined with Sir Robert's amazing voice at the top of his form. Dancin' Days is just plain great. A WAY- reworked version from the album song. You get the impression it was just thrown together for fun, and is it fun. <br />Black Dog is great, as usual, as is Dazed and Confused, and The Ocean. But, my overwhelming favorites are the absolutely genius level - brilliant S.I.B.L.You, perhaps the cleanest version of Moby Dick in existence, a great acoustic set, and the piec' de resistanc', Whole Lotta Love, with Jimmy playing an exotic, very, very wierd, but wonderful guitar chord-lead, while he exits to another dimension on the theremin. Meanwhile, magician mixer/engineer/recordist Eddie Kramer (Jimi Hendrix ... Are You Experienced, Electric Ladyland, Led Zep II, etc.) is doing some extraordinary mixing, throwing Pagey's theremin into 3D stereo, knocking it around the sound palette like a frizbee, then kicking one particular sequence into an echoplex, and bouncing it around like a celestial laser fest, the likes of which no one has heard before, or since. Absolutely the best version of W.L.Love I ever heard anywhere, live or otherwise.<br />A real rocker will NOT take naysayers advice about this album. Nonsense. This is the closest many of you will come to BEING at a classic Zep concert in your lifetimes!! Don't pass it up, because some wisecracks have to heap their negative derision on someone this week!! Give this dazzling work a listen. You WILL be rewarded greatly for your effort. Believe me!<br />This album would be memorable for having just ONE OR TWO of these phenomenal jewels exhibiting the execution of unbelievable talent. But to have this many superlatives, in just two shows in little over a week, on ONE CD set. Well, that's amazing, even for Zeppelin! <BR>...
B000002UAX|5.0|Track where these songs take you . . .<br />Picture this setting if you will: 10-12 university freshmen and sophomore friends sitting and lying around Gail and Debbie's room in Alice Lloyd dorm listening to this for the very first time, and then again, and again, and again. I don't remember if we went all night; I do know the volume wasn't up very high and no one was under the influence of anything other than the Beatles music. It was one of those more magical moments of our young lives.<br />Oddly enough, none of these new songs seemed foreign or odd - we'd already been exposed to so much back in those days. The overall flow was just beautiful and very compelling. Altogether, it was a most glorious night of warmth and quiet sharing.<br />So now when I attempt to review this or that song from that collection, I feel constrained not to be critical of this and that. Instead I would rather travel back in my mind's eye and my heart of hearts - to the memory of what had been and what in another sense always is.<br />So many of us were possibly more infatuated with the Beatles at that time than maybe any other performers then or since. I've always hesitated reviewing their work, fearing that I might sound too glib. That's why I'm resisting (for once) the tendency to be analytical, or to search my psyche for the nearest hovering sound bite or clever spin. Come what may, I'm going to leave the thrust of discourse to arise from the Beatles' songs themselves.
630280082X|5.0|I have purchased the VHS version of the movie CrossRoads, however, it would be a much better value if it were released in DVD.  After the music is placed into the digital format, the sound track would make this movie invaluable for any music lover.  Forget about the actors and their acting and concentrate on the storyline and the music.  You will be totally satisfied.
B000022TSW|4.0|I really love South park, but this movie just wasn't as good as I expected. Although, the show didn't become it's funniest until 2000, so that explains a little about it. I really thought this movie was good, It's just not my fave. It is worth buying though.
B000089RVX|4.0|I've seen some harsh critic reviews comparing the band to Tori Amos (huh?) and others (though, in what I've read nothing comparing them to Garbage with a similar gothic/tech rock sensibility). All I've got to say is AT LEAST IT IS DIFFERENT! For those of us (and I'm old enough to have a wide range of musical tastes) not into screaming boys (Incubus, Glassjaw, The Used) or pop (Justin Timberlake, Christina, Kelly Clarkson, etc) the choices are dismal. The writing on this album is a tad weak, the songs a little similar, but it is still good and a change from the usual. Worth the purchase!
B00000IP3S|5.0|Well, you could listen to some Blind Guardian for a start. This is the first taste I've had of this band, and I must say I'm very impressed. The lyrics are beautiful and the music is powerful. Hansi Kursch's voice takes a little getting used to, but after I listened to this a few times I grew accustomed to it. Some people love it and some hate it. If you've never heard them before, I'd check the samples to see if you like the singer's voice, otherwise go for it. This is my friend's favorite band and he says this is their best CD. Get it.
B00001NFCY|1.0|I will confess that I TRIED to like Creed. I heard \\"Higher\\" on the radio many times, and TRIED to understand the lyrics and not grind me teeth as the guitar player tried to remove his fingers from between the strings. The material on this album is horrible and I would strongly discourage anyone from buying it. All the guitars riffs are nothing more then noise. Religious lyrics?  You can't even understand them! Does Scott Stapp have something stuck in his mouth?
B000092ZYX|5.0|Let's see. Pablo Honey was ok. The Bends was way better. Ok Computer was great. Kid A was good. Amnesiac was great. Now there's Hail To The Thief. It's Radiohead's darkest album of their 6. People keep saying it goes back to their Bends era music which is partially true. They do bring nack their guitars on some songs but a lot of it is beat driven backed with effects like Kid A's \\"Idioteque.\\" I can't quite say that it's Radiohead's best because there is no such thing, but i can say this; it's a masterpiece. From start to end it's a refreshing new turn for Radiohead. Sure Thom Yorke swears it's not about the recent choices of the U.S. Government but after listening to the intuitive lyrics of the opener \\"2+2=5\\" (\\"Are you such a dreamer to put the wolrd at rights?\\" \\"Don't question my authority or put me in the dock\\") you can't help but doubt his ashurances. There's no one song to this album that sticks out like \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"Exit Music\\" or \\"I Might Be Wrong.\\" This album works as an album. As a collection. If the album only contained from \\"There There\\" to \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" it would still be a phenominal album. This may be Radiohead's darkest album but it has their most bright and cheerful mealodies. If Thom mumbled through all of \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" you'd walk a way with a cheerful smile on your face and want to go hug someeone, but when you listen to his lyrics you feel a little weirded out and worried. And if that track weirds you out, just listen to \\"Myxomatosis.\\" If you're not too dazzled by the intense fuzz bass lead then you might have time to think long and hard about what the hell Yorke is singing about, which happens to be mind control. The funny thing is the disease Myxomatosis (which killed rabbits in England) has nothing to do with mind control. The biggest factor of the album is Ed O'Brien's choiresque back-up vocals like in \\"There There\\" or the chilling three part harmonious, two minute ballad \\"I Will.\\" So forget Hailing to the Thief, Hail toRadiohead. 9/10 Highlights: \\"Wolf at the Door\\" \\"There There\\" \\"2+2=5\\" \\"Where I End And You Begin\\" \\"Myxamatosis\\" \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\"
B000002LCU|4.0|After 5 years off, George Harrison surprised everyone with his October, 1987 release, CLOUD NINE. With the help of his friends Gary Wright, Elton John, among others, he produced his first solid effort in 6 years. This is his best release after ALL THINGS MUST PASS. The title track is good, with a serious flavor that lets you know that he is back to his roots. \\"That's What It Takes\\" is my favorite song on the album, and it fills me with confidence every time I listen to it. \\"Fish On The Sand\\" is a catchy light rocker, and \\"Just For Today\\" is a nice piano ballad that shows off George's soft side. \\"When We Was Fab\\" is an excellant tribute to the Beatles. The Video won an award back in 1988 for BEST MUSIC VIDEO OF THE YEAR. \\"Devil's Radio\\" is a fast, upbeat rocker that gets you pumped up. \\"Wreck Of The Hesperus\\" is another catchy track, and \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" was a #1 hit that put George back on the map. <br />The only track I really don't like on this album is \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\" It's a dreamy, clunky number that really doesn't go anywhere. I remember buying the album on vinyl at Music Recyclery store back in my sophmore year in high school. I liked it so much that I went out and bought the CD. I was only 6 years old when it was originally released, so I really don't remember it. Regardless, this was George's return to fame, and is a highlight of his musical career. Long Live George Harrison.
0671027344|5.0|Alright, Being a high school student and reading this novel has made me realize a few different things. One, it made me look at my relationships with certain people and see the wonderfulness in them, it made me see how hard some people's lives can be, how silly and hipocritical teenagers are at times, and it made me realize, that if i wrote a novel like this one, i would worship myself. <BR>Reading the thoughts comming out of charlie's head, i found myself sympothizing with him a lot, which i don't normally do when i read. When he was excited and happy, i was too, when he was feeling weird and sad, i was too. the book kinda has that effect. <BR>This book is put together fabulously, and it is the type of story that gets passed around from friend to friend, something you want everyone to read and know about. and you will read it more than once. gaurenteed. <BR>I havn't met a person who dislikes this book. the worst reveiw i got was \\"i enjoyed it for the most part, but charlie cried a lot and it kinda made me wanna punch him, and then when i found out why he was crying. i felt bad for wanting to punch him and i wanted to give him a hug\\"<BR>not bad. <BR>Somthing i thought that was really neat about the book, was that the author chose to include the names of books and music and movies that have been popular over the years. <BR>i don't really know what to say other than, i highly recomend this book to any kind of person and that it was truely a treat to read. and i normally hate reading.
B00005JM09|1.0|I loved the first Terminator film and T2 (seen both multiple time), but T3 - what a disappointment! Aside from a single good chase - there's really nothing interesting at all about the movie. The story and plot were very weak. And only a handful semi-humorous jokes and one-liners, really makes the movie forgetable. The \\"terminatrix\\" ,although gorgeous, was about as intriguing as Natasha Henstridge (the hot alien character) in the movie \\"Species\\". I wanted to like the movie but was really let down. If you really have to see it, don't expect much.
B000088DSQ|5.0|These performances are very musical, intimate, joyous, sometimes aggressive, and thankfully well recorded. They are well thought-out and entirely washed clean of all preconceived notions of how these works should sound -- a refreshing and engaging result. Much care is given to clarity, subtlety, shading and phrasing... When I want to hear these works I always return to Pollini with Bohm and Jochum and Abbado, Michelangeli with Freccia and Giulini, Rudolf Serkin with Bernstein and Ormandy, and now I am very glad to welcome these wonderful performances into my collection... I would also love to hear their interpretations of the Rondo WoO 6 and the Choral Fantasy!
B000002UR7|5.0|I remember when my brother showed this to me, I was 13 and I loved it. It had so much power and depth and in places almost had a punk feel.  It definately captures the energy that you feel sometimes but keep bottled in as a kid and I think that is why I listened to it so much when I was still a teenager. It was like a release.  After hearing it I really started getting into music and a lot of the things I like now stem from the hearing of this album. &quot;Thinking About You&quot; and &quot;Prove Yourself&quot; always are good.  I don't know why there are so many Radiohead fans that don't listen to this album. It sounds like them except a bit more of a garage feel (not really a sound)is there. It did for Radiohead what &quot;3 Imagiary Boys&quot; did for The Cure in that it set their image and you knew that they might get big but they would always seem little. Its one of those bands that you think speaks to you more than anyone else and nobody could quite understand what you understand about it.
B00005JM09|5.0|It is the most exiting and action packed movie in 2003. Lord of the rings watch out or you might be terminated. Intense, suspenseful, this movie packes a punch that not even Rocky Balboa could handle. 'WOW MOVIES' gives it ***** stars.
0060537639|5.0|The main argument of this book, that the Chinese drew the charts the Europeans used to colonize the world in the age of exploration, makes a lot of sense. This book's thesis lives and dies by the fact that the medieval &quot;charts of the world&quot; held accurate information long before Europeans got that far. Information that only the Chinese could possibly have gathered.<br />I appreciate the mariner's viewpoint and experience Menzies brings to this issue. He lays out how the voyages could have happened given ship designs, wind, and currents. His research into languages and physical evidence is impressive. Obviously, he has been thinking about this for many years.<br />In the end, I want to believe there is something to all this. This theory of the Bimini road &amp; the idea that the Columbus brothers were the greatest forgers of all time appeal to me. In the end, truth really is stranger than fiction.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This was the best movie I've seen for ages and the best one in 2002!<BR>The actors play well but Daniel Day Lewis and Cameron Diaz are simply amazing!!!!<BR>The set is wonderfully made, everything is perfectly reconstructed as it was at the time. <BR>I was really interested to discover more about NYC history and I wasn't disappointed.<BR>The movie is just a little too violent, but it really was like that in the 19th century.<BR>I simply loved it, I saw it twice and I'm going to buy the DVD.
0609610570|3.0|I guess I had high hopes for this book. And don't get me wrong, its a good strong book with great ideas. But I have already read this book. Just with different names. I guess its like when someone tells you a movie is great, it can't help but be a let down. I had a few people tell me how wonderful this book was. I can only guess that people told them the book was going to be bad. Still, worth reading if you don't know the points the book covers.<br />...
B00005JLSE|1.0|I can't believe the masterpiece \\"Gangs of New York\\", or the kinda-classic \\"The Two Towers\\" got passed over for this load of filth.  I mean, the songs aren't catchy, and if I hear \\"All That Jazz\\" (playing it ONCE at the Oscars is enough, not EVERY SINGLE TIME this movie was brought up...not to mention when it shows up in the film) one more time, I'll kill the man that came up with it.  These actors (they're actors, not singers) cannot sing to save their lives, and the lyrics sure don't help.  Add in direction by someone who can't direct, writing by someone who should have his pen taken away, and snapshot, confusing editing, and you have a witch's brew the weird sisters in \\"Macbeth\\" wouldn't touch.  Junk.
0316666343|5.0|It's a wonderful story unlike any other I've read before.<BR>It's just beautiful, it's my favorite book. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00005JKN9|5.0|A masterpiece, plain and simple.  Deserving 10, if not 20 Oscars which it didn't win.  A classic.  Now that that is out of the way, let me go on a little rant.<br />To the reviewer that said \\"Science Fiction\\" as the title of their review, films are NOT documentaries.  They are meant as a form of entertainment, not too educate, get that through your skull.  As for the fight in the beginning, that happened all the time in this period in this city - cops were there solely to keep the poor from assaulting the rich.  As for the most sophisticated city, research the history of New York.  It is gory, blood soaked, corrupt, and violent in this period.  Scorsese (a person worthy of Kubrick-like praise if there ever was one) captured this very well.  Research before you make stupid claims.<br />As for the people that say DiCaprio can't act...what is wrong with you?  The man can act, and act well.  I mean, jealousy must be behind these claims.  That, or you still believe it's \\"cool\\" to hate anything involved with Titanic (a very good film once you get past the cheesy love story), which it isn't.  Open your eyes and your mind for once and enjoy the film.  As for Day-Lewis, he does an amazing job, worthy of Marlon Brando in \\"On the Waterfront\\".  Him being passed up for the uninspired performance of Adrien Brody, just goes too show the Academy Awards aren't based on the best in each category, but most publicly accepted.<br />So, just see this film, avoiding the nay-sayers.  I'm almost positive you'll at least enjoy, if not love it.
B000002LPH|5.0|Of the albums George Harrison released in between All Things Must Pass and Cloud Nine, this is my favorite.  Despite the uncharacteristically boring packaging, his self-titled album finds George more in his element than he had been in the past six years (though the subject of God is conspicuously absent, or maybe I'm just not looking hard enough).<BR>The optimistic &quot;Love Comes To Everyone&quot; sets the mood for the album.  Although it's a great song, the best is yet to come.  &quot;Not Guilty&quot; is a great song that George had since the Beatles' White Album sessions (why the Beatles never used it is unknown--they recorded over 100 takes!).  &quot;Here Comes The Moon&quot; (a &quot;little brother&quot; to &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;) was written in Hawaii after George witnessed the sun setting as the moon came up...beautiful song, very visual.  I don't particularly care for &quot;Soft-Hearted Hana,&quot; as it seems somewhat out of place on this album.  It's quirky, though it doesn't spoil the album's mood.  &quot;Blow Away&quot; &amp; &quot;Faster&quot; (my two favorites) prove that, although his music wasn't the most commercial, George could still write an A1 pop song.  &quot;Dark Sweet Lady&quot; &amp; &quot;Your Love Is Forever&quot; (two of my other personal favorites) are both soft &amp; warm.  &quot;Dark Sweet Lady&quot; has a spanish feel to it.  &quot;Soft Touch&quot; was written about George's newly-born son and is another warm, sweet song.  &quot;If You Believe&quot; kicks up the tempo slightly and finishes the album on a happy, hopeful note--full circle.
B000002MP2|5.0|Everybody knows how popular this CD is and most people who I've talked to about this CD always say they like the melody and the catchyness but not everybody realizes how good the lyrics are and that sometimes anoys me. Also not everybody gives enough credit to the less popular songs on the album. A lot of people usually just talk about longview, basket case, welcome to paradise, and She. I think the best written songs on the CD are Pulling teeth and Coming Clean and are my favorites. Despite all that this CD is still an Alternative, Post-grunge album that bands today constantly copy it(sum 41, Blink 182, Simple plan) and can't get it nearly as good as Green Day...
0312983867|4.0|I've read all of the Stephanie Plum novels and this one left me feeling empty somehow.  I don't think it had as many &quot;laugh out loud&quot; parts as some of Evanovich's previous novels.
0790731940|5.0|A great modern made western with a lot of comedy.  But it doesn't stop at the comedy.. there's plenty of action and realistic settings.
B00005JLYU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it the day it came out. The action was much bigger, the dancing was much cooler, and it was sillier than the first. Bernie Mac and Demi Moore made great additions to the sequel. The whole thing about Dylan's name in the past (Helen Zaas) was very funny. The cameos were cool( the Olsen Twins and Eve). As soon as this movie comes out on DVD, I'm going to go get it. Go see this movie. It's really good and you won't have fun at any other movie.
B000092Q7O|5.0|Roman Polanski's \\"The Pianist\\" is a brilliantly produced tale based on the true story of a Polish Jew whose strong will to survive carried him through the darkest days of Nazi occupation of Poland.  The acting is superlative in all the roles, from Adrian Brody's lead to lesser roles, like the well-dressed lady in the Warsaw ghetto who obsessively asks everyone, \\"Have you seen my husband?\\" A notable acting performance is also given in the role of the German captain who, as the Russians approach Poland, gives his overcoat to the pianist, partly out of kindness and partly to try to enlist his aid as the Germans are defeated and captured.<br />  The photography is superb, the attention to detail is excellent.  This is Polanski's master work.<br />  Although the movie is bleak throughout, with much suffering and no light relief or moments of humor, it is also suffused with hope, with endurance, with the will to survive.  One of the most moving scenes is when the pianist lifts the lid of a piano in the apartment where he hides.  He cannot play it, for the sound might alert others, but he holds his hands over the keys, fingers the air, and mentally hears the piece his hands are playing.<br />  Although the theme is bleak, \\"The Pianist\\" will lift your heart.  Thumbs up and the highest recommendation!
1400034779|4.0|This is a character I wish I knew in real life.  Warm, wise, witty -- have just ordered the three sequels because I just can't get enough of Mma.Ramotswe, the main character of this series.  I also appreciated the African experience; it whets my appetite for more.  If you need a lift, read this novel.  You'll come away richer for the experience.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I can't really consider myself a Beck fan. I just couldn't really get into his music over the years however I was intrigued by his latest album \\"Sea Change\\" after hearing \\"Lost Cause\\" several times on the radio, not to mention reading all the critical praises it garnered from critics. I recently found a copy of \\"Sea Change\\" at my favorite record store and of course bought it. After listening to it a few times, I can't really see what the hoopla was over this cd. I enjoyed it immensely but I certainly don't agree with a lot of critics when they put this album as one of the best of 2002. Overall the sense of melancholy in the lyrics does make this cd great to listen to on a rainy day. I wasn't wild about \\"Paper Tiger\\" but Beck's deep, rich vocals made the song interesting. \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" is certainly one of my favorite songs on the cd. There is a slight country tinge to the music. No matter how many times I have heard \\"Lost Cause\\" on the radio, I can never tire of hearing that song. Definitely one of my favorite Beck songs on \\"Sea Change\\". Although I still am not a converted Beck fan, I must say that \\"Sea Change\\" is a charming album that was well worth the money. I might have to check out \\"Mutations\\" in the near future. I like the folksier Beck than the more experimental Beck.
B00005JM1F|4.0|What I particularly liked about this movie and thought it did so well was appeal to a more expansive demographic than its recent new-age-real-comedy cousins like American Pie and Road Trip.  It offers a vicarious escape from a mundane, suburban reality for those individuals looking to recapture the days of their elder-adolescence.  It encourages the recently thirty-somethings to embrace their residual immaturity and not abandon their proclivity to party.  It also has obvious value with those still living their elder and younger adolescence.  Story line goes a little something like this:  Dude breaks up with girlfriend and realizes his life has become a cesspool of barbeques and picnics, completely devoid of the reckless abandon he used to thrive off of.  His friends begin marrying off and as a way of reclaiming his more carefree days he moves to a college campus and becomes the founding father of a faux fraternity which doesn't discriminate on age, academic standing, class status, or even being a student.  As their popularity swells they battle for recognition from the university which they find themselves loosely affiliated, while the sinister dean plots to ka bash their senseless shenanigans.  Through out their plight there's a continual stream of comedic antics that carry an otherwise sluggish plot.  Its success and popularity are a direct result of combining and expanding upon the recent comedic successes of movies like American Pie, Van Wilder, and Office Space.  Come next Academy season it may not warrant an Oscar nod, but it's is a laugh a minute and worth the rent.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I love the music of the 80's, and Madonna's first album is a club record all about pop, punk and falling in love? Yup, cheesy compared to 'American Life' (another great CD) Anyway, this CD rates as follows:<br />Number 1: Lucky star-4.9/5<br />Number 2: Borderline-5/5<br />Number 3: Burning up-4.8/5<br />Number 4: I know it-4.8/5<br />Number 5: Holiday-5/5<br />Number 6: Think of me-4.9/5<br />Number 7: Physical attraction-4.9/5<br />Number 8: Everybody-4.9/5<br />Every song gets an A, SOME GET 4.8/5 which is basically a 97 to 98% &amp; some get 4.9 or 5 which is an A+<br />Great 80's CD....Along with 1983's thriller!
B000066NW0|3.0|I have listened to this album i do like some songs cause  i can relate to one losing grip cause of my break up. But she is a poser. IF she was a rock girl she would be growling her freakin brains out like kittie. Yes she does have guitar skills....she says she a punk girl well how can you be punk and rock at the same time. She ticks me off so bad sometimes. But its her life
B00008OWZC|5.0|I'm pushing 50 and have been a Zep fan as long as I can remember. I was expecting the same old songs again but bought it anyway.The songs and the audio quality sounds so much better that any of the past recordings. Thanks Jimmy for putting this together for us!!!
0142004235|2.0|It's a shame that Oprah chose this of all Steinbeck's novels to resuscitate her book club. 'East of Eden' is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's worst.<br />This was Steinbeck's bid to enter the lofty realms of the 'serious' author. So it is predictably bleak and angst-ridden, its characters constantly mired in futility and frustration.<br />How different from the far sunnier (and more distinctive) novels, 'Tortilla Flat' and 'Cannery Row' and 'Sweet Thursday' -- any of which would have been a more agreeable choice.<br />....<br />This is as close as Steinbeck comes to one of those potboiler sagas that just seem to go on and on and on, grinding through decade upon decade, and generation upon generation.<br />Pick anything else by Steinbeck.<br />Anything.
B00009TB5G|5.0|My review is based upon the theatrical release of the movie since obviously the DVD is not out yet.  I will wait for the Extended edition to come out in November.  From the sounds of things, this set will be every bit as good as FOTR Extended edition which may be the all-time best DVD package.<br />A Whopping 40 minutes have been restored back into the movie, making it check in now at just under 4 hours.  I cannot wait to see what was put back in.  Also, the additional disks seem to promise the same mountain of additional material that FOTR did.  I congratulate Peter Jackson for really taking care of the fans of these movies.<br />AS to the movie itself, the Fellowship has now been scattered.  Frodo and Sam are on their way to Mordor where they meet and forge an uneasy alliance with Gollum.  Pippin and Merry have been kidnapped by Orcs, and Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn are tracking the kidnappers.<br />Lots has to happen in a very short period of time...And even given three hours things have to be condensed or outright eliminated.  This may be the most popular complaing among Tolkein fans but the fact is that there is no choice.  You'd have to do a trilogy for EACH book if you really wanted to cover everything.<br />Among the main happenings in Two Towers is the meeting of Gollum, the Return of Gandalf, the introduction of the Ents, and the Battle of Helms Deep.  The Battle of Helms Deep is one of the great battle sequences ever filmed, no matter what the time period.<br />It will be great to sit down and watch the extended edition a few times before the release of Return of the King in December.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I've always loved Japanese Anime and this movie is just AMAZING. It is one of the best movie's I have ever seen. It follows the story of Chihiro when she moves to a new town. When driving into the town her parents get lost and find themselves in trouble in the spirit world and it is Chihiro's job to save them. This has many strange characters where all you can think of when you look at them is WOW. The animation is simply beautiful. Miyazaki had really out done himself here. This is a must buy. Also check out other Miyazaki films, this man is a genius.
B000092ZYX|5.0|First things first,Radiohead was not made for the mainstream listening audience.  There songs will not be played on top 40 radio and MTV will rarely play any of their videos.  Yet with all of this taken into account it is great to see how Radiohead have grown into one of the biggest bands of our times.  <BR>Their latest album, &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot; fallows the growth path that radiohead has been traveling on since their release of Pablo Honey in the early 90's. <BR>The albums starts with a great track, &quot;2+2=5&quot; which brings radiohead back to their guitar and amp roots which have been missing in their last 2 albums.  <BR>The course of the albums is dark, sulky and moody.  But overall you will need to listen to this album more than once to fully understand the lyrics and chord progression.  <BR>This is not their greastest album but definatley a great album to own and absorb.
0380018179|2.0|I'll admit it, I buy into hype a lot, which is why I read this book.  The way people talked about it as well as its TV movie version, I expected a masterpiece along the lines of Gone With The Wind, which I read and loved.  I can't say the same for The Thorn Birds.<br />First off, I can not see how a thorn bird (a bird that endures pain on a thorn to sing a few minutes of a beautiful song) fit into the story.  It is supposed to explain the forbidden love between a young girl, Meggie, and a priest named Ralph.  However, it is touched on so lightly that it seems more like the two have crushes on each other than anything.  The only part that I thought came even close to interesting was when Meggie married a man because of his stature (Luke) and ended up in an extremely unhappy marriage.  The rest of the text is more or less a complete bore.<br />Overall, though, the concept was interesting and some of the writing was just beautiful.  However, I still cannot say that those two make this a worthy read.  In fact, the whole time I managed to read this I kept thinking that this book tried way too hard to be the next Gone With The Wind.  Read that one, but not this one.  Meggie is no Scarlett O'Hara.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Should a film be faulted for being the all-time most commercially successful production ever? Should we begrudge the fact that millions of teenagers watch it to see Leonardo DiCaprio, and perhaps Kate Winslett? Or that the movie's theme is a sappy love song sung by pop diva Celine Dion?<br />From where I'm sitting, no. Titanic just happens to be immensely popular, and those who have difficulty swallowing that and consistently bash this film are likely the same snobs who hate DiCaprio and refuse to be identified with the swooning teenagers and all others who comprise the unsophisticated \\"pop\\" crowd.<br />I wouldn't want to be either (ok, I'm a snob too), but the sheer spectacle of this movie simply cannot be ignored. Consider: James Cameron virtually recreated the Titanic, constructing sets that duplicated the ill-fated ship's interiors down to the last detail. In the early part of the film, he actually takes us to the site of the disaster and explores the innermost chambers of the real Titanic. The costuming, too, was flawless, and as if that weren't enough, Cameron picked actors who actually looked like the real people who went on that maiden voyage. How can anybody deny Cameron the credit he deserves, with all the hard work he put into this film?<br />But beyond production design and casting, and even beyond being a disaster flick and a love story, this film is a very insightful social commentary. The arrogance, snobbishness, and frivolity of the upper class are so effectively put into perspective here, never more so than when Ruth Dewitt Bukater asks, even as the ship is sinking, \\"Will the lifeboats be seated according to class?\\" After her rebellious daughter Rose berates her, saying \\"Half the people on this ship are going to die,\\" Cal Hockley retorts, \\"Not the better half.\\" <br />Particularly noteworthy is the noveau riche Molly Brown, who proves to be the kindhearted member of the upper class. Not surprisingly, she is the one who, in the eyes of her fellow-first class passengers, does not belong.<br />Those who regard this social commentary aspect as a mere footnote to the entire film have missed a very important point. Without this element, the love story that takes place between Jack Dawson and Rose would be ultimately meaningless. The role that social class played in determining who would be saved and who would not would likewise go unnoticed. <br />And that would have been the real disaster.<br />If Titanic is popular for all the wrong reasons, there is really nothing we can do about that. But please, let's give credit where credit is due. It may not be a great film, but it is a very good film. For all the right reasons.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I just heard Johnny Cash's CD American IV.  AMAZING!  You cannot find an example of someone singing from the heart as you can on this album.  With every word and note, I felt emotional throughout the CD.  I heard his love for his wife, painful memories of his life, and I think maybe even an apology?  <br />This is the first review that I have ever written.  I was so compelled because of a review that I read about this CD by a music fan from MADISON WISCONSIN that was extremely negative.  I know that most musically inclined people will dismiss his/her immaturity and obvious disrespect for a person whom they know nothing about.  MUSIC IS EMOTION.  I feel that through music, we can express our emotions better than any other way.  <br />I've been a Johnny Cash fan since I can remember listening to music.  He was an idol of mine growing up, and still remains one today.  I have been teaching music in the public schools for 15 years now.  I only wish that I could tell everyone how important it is to always \\"feel\\" the music.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this CD!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is an understatement to say the least. Let me start by saying thank you CD-Now for taking that horrible review of this CD that stated Sparta as being more talented: Sparta is a good band: not as good as ATDI, or TMV: this shows me very much if the listener is an ameteure. If you can't handle this stuff you're never going to be a TALENTED musician. You'll be in a manufactured rock boy band like Trapt with a bunch of preps. So anybody that has something to say about this band can take it up with my fist. Anyway; this cd is THE album of the year. It's an instant classic and I never doubted them from the start. WHO CARES ABOUT CEDRIC'S HIGH PITCHED SCREAM?! That's what makes him one of the most talented singers ever! This music is spastic fusion jazz: that's the best term for me to put it into; yeah it's got some emo or whatever you wanna call it but it's just an orchestrated orgasm of sound. Other albums I reccommend are the Deftones new album, Poison the Well's, Cave-In's, Radiohead's, and Fairweather's. THIS ALBUM IS STILL ONE OF THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENTS IN MUSIC!
6303212379|4.0|This movie was pretty good just way to freakin' boring!
B000099T2L|3.0|It's not as bad as I expected, and I like some of the tracks. &quot;Dangerouls in love&quot; is fresh, different and roar. The song, not the album. &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, is what made me purchase the album. Great Job on this track Beyonce. (OH NA NA NA). Otherwise all the other traks can still make you dance. Good effort coming from the Destiny Child's name. You wanna hear a great album. Pop Blu Cantrell's Bittersweet in your CD player. Now that's music.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie really surprised me...and that says a lot. I'm a veteran action movie junkie-I bet I've seen thousands of action scenes,my sentimental favorites being the Hong Kong variety. As in John Woo,pre-Hollywood. You know,the stuff that makes your jaw drop,your adrenaline rush,etc. The original \\"Matrix\\" was incredible,while \\"Reloaded\\" was still pretty cool.Wanna know why it wasn't incredible,and \\"Equilibrium\\" is? Because now that the \\"Hong Kong influence\\" is part of our American film lexicon,we've sort of seen it all before. It takes some mighty doings nowadays to make our jaws drop. But \\"Equilibrium\\" isn't just about the original,unforgettable action scenes (that you will replay again & again.)It has a solid story,maybe not wholly original,but the approach to the action (and the thought behind it)was REAL original.Kung Fu? Seen it-slow motion,bone breaking,physics defying,wire flying,yadda yadda. Gunplay? Who can top the master...Woo & Yun-Fat said it & did it all in Hong Kong. Or so you thought...howzabout \\"Gun Fu\\"? With scenes so utterly cool,you may forget you love martial arts fights! Oh,and throw in some katana-style swordplay,along with Christian Bale,the most unflappable gunfighter since a certain \\"man with no name\\".Then add a solid storyline,great editing,terrific acting and a restrained directorial hand (no \\"bullet time\\" or slow-mo O.D. here),and you have probably what will be the greatest futuristic actioneer that no one has heard of (in this or any other year). BUY IT!!! You won't regret it...
B00009EIQE|5.0|I really don't understand the bad reviews for this album. I realize everybody's taste is different but I love this album! Sure, it had the potential to blow. Buddy has made some blatant attempts to break into the mainstream which fell flat. Even those albums had many things to admire on them. This country blues tribute is awesome from start to finish. If you didn't know that Buddy was one of the all time greats before, you know now. It's like you're sitting right next to him on a hot summer evening waiting on the first cool breeze. The picking is restrained but still smoking and Buddy's vocals have never sounded more soulful. Check out &quot;Crawling Kingsnake&quot;, &quot;Moanin and Groanin&quot; and &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor&quot;. If you're not hooked by then, there's something wrong with you!
B000089RVX|4.0|When I first heard Bring Me To Life on the radio, I knew this wasn't your typical Britney Spears. Eventually I got the CD, and I am very glad I did. Along with Bring Me To Life, there are 10 other songs on the CD. I love every single one of them. Some say all the songs sound the same, but I couldn't disagree more. The ballad My Immortal is very diverse from the rest of the CD and in my opinion is the best song. I hope my opinion helps you.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Froget the hype. For anyone who has had a spiritual experience, the title song and rest of the album truly reflect a desire for a spiritual concsiouness in a material world. \\"Like a Prayer, I'll Take You There, It's like A Dream to Me.\\"  What person in this world full of selfishness and ego, doesn't wish to go there, where prayers go. The beauty and truth in the song is the path of the singer. At first she says yes, than no, no more, \\"I have no choice,\\" Than of course, I feel like dancing, where the seeker  and sought are one. The dance after a successful journey is truly a moment of joy, as beautifully expressed by the choir.<br />  As for the name, Madonna's name is surely a connection to a heavenly entity. None less than the Buddha, before he adopted his life of ascetism, enjoyed every pleasure of the physical world, including sex(See Siddharrtha). He came to see their emptiness. While our songstress may not exactly rise to the greatness of her namesake, (or that of the Buddha), she surely has a spark of her soul. What we are witnessing is the journey of mankind form a low, mundane, physical conscious, to a place where the Light of the world will be revealed. (Ray of Light) We will see how for she goes with her spiritual desires, but based on her last three albums, she seems to be on the right track.
B000002TLX|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I once contemplated legally changing my name to Richard Marx.  From the moment I heard the opening riff of &quot;Don't Mean Nuthin'&quot; I was hooked.  But then came a string of sappy tunes, such as &quot;Right Here Waiting For You.&quot;  This left me confused...kinda like walking into the men's room and passing a guy walking out with a big grin on his face.  I didn't know what to think.  Fortunately, he got rid of his mullet.  I always liked &quot;Endless Summer Nights.&quot;  Great tune.<BR>To summarize, this album is great because it's almost as if he put all his best songs and biggest hits onto one album and released it.  Everything seems to be here!  Pick this one up!
B00000IL1K|5.0|a lovely album that coalesces sounds of symphony, pop, folk and even a little synth in a manner proving endlessly entertaining.<br />Her voice is a heavenly tool that gently but powerfully lifts you into other realms. She so deftly moves between genres and re-invents certain songs while giving them fresh life.<br />With all the other female vocalists who sell their souls to corporations or behave like imbeciles in the press, it is wonderful that we have such a graceful and talented presence as MS. Brightman.<br />This collection of songs is a soothing and well-produced work that comes highly recommended.
B000002UWE|5.0|Talk Talk were a large part of my formative years at college in the UK and are an all time favourite. Their melancholic and ethereal compositions were in stark contrast to clubbing to the equally excellent but wholly different ABC, Pigbag and Heaven 17. Often I had (and still have to a certain extent) no idea what the lyrics are but the haunting and plaintive chord structure just tugs at something deep inside. 'Dum Dum Girl' and 'Such a Shame' stand out. This album is a fantastic introduction/nostagia trip to the beauty of Talk Talk and will undoubtedly lead the unsuspecting listener to buying their whole back catalogue. Just don't play it if you're 22, inebriated at a terrible party in Birmingham and you're relationship's just gone pear-shaped!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Seven, The Game, Panic Room and Fight Club are each David Fincher's films. Fight Club and Seven stand out the most, The Game was fantastic, and Panic Room was certainly suspenseful. Fight Club was such a great role for Edward Norton. There was not a single scene that he was in where he didn't just draw me into his character completely. Brad Pitt's role was just plain fun, and Helena Bonham Carter was mysterious. Fight Club was an unforgettable film with unforgettable elements. This is certainly not something that kids should see, for its R rating reflects strong graphic brutal violence, language and some sexuality including prolonged sequences where moaning is heard throughout a house. As a whole, Fight Club is one of the most amazing films that I have ever seen and I strongly recommend it, especially for fans of anyone in the cast or of David Fincher.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I loved Daredevil.  I loved the comic too, and even with some of the controversial decisions involved, such as hiring a black actor to play the Kingpin, I think this is the most faithful adaptation of a comic book to film so far.  Daredevil has always been a darker more interesting character, and the filmmakers have really captured his spirit in this film.  Ben Affleck actually does an admirable job and Jennifer Garner is spot on as elektra.
B00006LWSF|3.0|Many people have already said it wasn't what they expected or that you shouldn't buy it just 4 Eminem, and I have 2 agree, it couldn't b truer. I was quite disapointed, it wasn't at ALL what I had hoped it 2 b. I love \\"8 Mile\\" and a few other songs, but that's about it. Save your money or burn it!
0609610570|2.0|I bought this book because some managers with whom I was working were reading it - their CEO had pushed it at them.  I was very disappointed.  Great title but... there didn't seem to be anything about the discipline of doing anything in it.  I did force myself to read it from cover-to-cover, underlined and made notes in the margins, and at the end flipped back through it to see if somehow I'd missed somehting. Lots of verbal arm-waving and self-evident maxims for anyone who is halfway thinking.  Execution?  No. Might be good fodder for a CEO who is struggling with putting together a good speech or rallying cry to the troops.  And... I'll give the author credit for at least tackling a topic that IS important.  This is a book that I would have wanted to be very good.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I strongly recommend this DVD, but not for any reason the average slacker nitwit might understand or appreciate.<br />\\"Old School\\" is execrable. (And that's being nice.) The director, who's also the co-writer, has absolutely no idea how to create interesting characters, get them to interact in an amusing manner appropriate the the plot, or \\"build\\" the story to a comic catharsis. It's like listening to an early Dvorak symphony -- good ideas, poor development. Todd Phillips is a \\"talent\\" on the level of John Hughes.<br />If you were hoping the unrated version included NC-17 material, forget it. There's nothing that goes beyond the R rating of the theatrical release. And the end credits include a gratuitous scene in which two of the \\"bad\\" characters die in a gruesome freak accident.<br />If you want a genuinely funny movie about college life, try \\"Animal House,\\" \\"Back to School,\\" or \\"Real Genius.\\" Heck, \\"Amadeus\\" is a _lot_ funnier, and it isn't even _billed_ as a comedy.<br />So, why is this DVD is a \\"must-buy\\"? Have you seen \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\" on Bravo? The host, James Lipton, is one of the most pompous, nauseatingly fawning intellectual jerks ever to walk the planet -- even worse than Dick Cavett. One of the DVD extras is a devastatingly nasty send-up of the show, with \\"Old School\\"'s director and the three principal actors a Lipton look-alike's guests. This alone justifies the price.<br />But I will admit that Patrick Cranshaw rules!
B000001FA4|5.0|This album is the quintessential must have for any U2 fan! The songs eb and flow in a poetic ballet to bring out emotion and instant loyalty to the listener. This album is very powerful in lyrics and music all wrapped together in huge beautiful package by the masterful production talent of the great Brian Eno. A MASTERPIECE!
0451167716|1.0|The Godfather was a great movie.  The first sequel is the second greatest American movie after Citizen Kane.  But the novel is [bad].  The sex and violence are the point, whereas in the films family and honor and corruption were just a few of the points.  The novel is written amateurishly and comes off as just sleazy.  I was curious after having seen the films so many times without reading the book, and I couldn't believe that such good adaptations could come from such junk!
0792146670|5.0|This two-parter was a terrific season-ending ST-TNG episode, featuring a duel with the Cardassians, Captain Picard in jeopardy and a new commander for the Star Ship Enterprise.<br />And the Enterprise crew really let us down.  Rather than exhibiting military professionalism and backing to the hilt their new commander -- Capt. Jellico, magnificently portrayed by Ronny Cox -- they fought him every step of the way.  The story had a strong emotional pull on the viewers, thus the obvious course was to sympathize with the crew's irritation at their new boss, whose personality was far different from that of Capt. Picard.  However, that crew was placed on that ship to carry out orders issued by their captain, to the letter and spirit of his or her desires.  Possibly their long association with Capt. Picard had made them too buddy-buddy with him, somewhat slack in their militarism, and weak in adapting to a personnel/command change.<br />Here's a new (though experienced) commander placed in charge of a crew whose former commander had been drafted for a special mission.  Capt. Jellico too had a special mission, a head-to-head negotiation with hostile Cardassians.  Rather than being completely free to concentrate on that mission, Capt. Jellico had to deal with the distractions of crew sensitivity and grudging cooperation, which extended to Executive Officer Riker's outright insubordination (for which he was quite properly relieved!).  And Jellico was eminently appropriate in ordering Deanna to dress more professionally, rather than prancing around in her skin-tight slack-suit.<br />At first glance, combined with the history of being emotionally connected to the Enterprise crew, it could have been perceived that Capt. Jellico was being harsh and/or unfair -- but further thought, coupled with an understanding of how a military chain of command functions, illuminates only the fact that Riker, Deanna and the others truly reflected poorly upon Capt. Picard, who should have nurtured in them the ability to conform professionally to whatever martial situations they encountered.  Instead, they acted like a bunch of whiny teenagers.<br />Capt. Jellico, upon his departure, told the crew it had been a privilege to serve with them.  Later, however, I bet he subtly, quietly passed the word in his professional circle that the Enterprise command crew was a gaggle of spoiled brats, and working with any of them on a future assignment should probably be avoided.  I believe that is what I would have done.ured in them the ability to conform professionally to whatever martial situations they encountered.

0688163173|5.0|If you start Shutter Island, be prepared to spend sleepless nights until you are finished. Once I reached the halfway mark, I couldn't devour the pages fast enough. And the ending is absolutely mind-blowing. A great, fun summer read.
B000003N7K|5.0|Very simply the greatest album of recorded music in the history of mankind.There has to be one right?Well this is it.
B00005JM09|5.0|When I came out of viewing, \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\\" I knew it was the greatest movie I've seen in a very long time. I also asked myself and a couple other friends the question we've all been asking ourselves after watching it, \\"Is it better than the first and second ones?\\"... it was different and more fast-paced. Everything seemed to be happening at the heat of the moment more in this one. It was brilliantly done!
B00005JLYU|5.0|Three women detectives with super duper kung fu skills work as a team to counter a former associate and mentor who has gone astray. This movie is funny, action packed with unbelievable stunts, glamour and glitz. The message of the story is, \\"There is no 'I' in team.\\"<br />The fallen angel, played by Demi Moore (If I do 500 sit ups each day, eat right, and find a good plastic surgeon, I may look half as good as she does for a 40 yr old). She manipulates Charlie, the angels, the government, and criminals (foreign and domestic) to get what she wants. The fallen angel struggles with her desire to prove that she was and will always be the best angel. She wants to be in control. Unfortunately, she ends up a bitter loner who gets her a** kicked in the end. She was really a tough byatch. It took three angels to take her out. <br />Bernie Mac, the replacement Bosley added a colorful dimension to the movie.  He played the substitute role well. It was through his character that the angels discover that their client was the bad guy.<br />The movie explores the personal relationships of the angels. What if an angel decides to marry? How long will the team be together? Why is Drew Barrymore's character attracted to evil men? Should their true profession be kept secret from their families? What if a parent is mistakenly lead to believe that his daughter is a prostitute?<br />These questions are answered in the movie. It is an entertaining feature of action and adventure. There is eye candy for males and females. Humor is interjected throughout. It's amazing how the angels escape death time after time to glamorously defeat the ultimate foe. That's the magic this movie.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I was pleased with the song selection and quality of songs. At first, had some doubts that the intros were a bit too long (comon, get to the music!) but it all sounds right now. The intros help build the mood for the sudden crash of each song. The live versions of For Whom the Bell Tolls and One are among the best I've heard...James has that certain anger in his voice and hits each pause and note quite well.
B000003N8R|5.0|Several of the 21 reviewers who got to this CD before me see &quot;Crescent&quot; as dark, heavy, brooding, somber. I think those words have a negative feel which is inaccurate. I like this 40-minute release from 1964 more than &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; which followed it a year later. These five Coltrane originals may not have the &quot;force&quot; of the later disc, but they are more enjoyable as a casual listening experience, by far. While the four ballads and one blues are on the mellow side, there is nothing dull here. Beauty is created at Rudy Van Gelder's NJ studio once again by John, McCoy, Jimmy and Elvin and producer Bob Thiele. If you like Coltrane at all, don't be afraid of &quot;Crescent&quot;---while there is an edge to it that John didn't show in his 1950's albums, it is a gentle surface, harmless and harmonic.
B00008NG5V|5.0|\\"Chill, bluesy, mellow, California Surfer acoustic rock\\"  I think that basically sums this album up. it's awsome.<BR>Jack Johnson's first cd is in my opinion, one of the greatest albums ever. And i think it was refreshing to hear acoustic guitars and creativity, because nowadays, everyone plays fast, pop-punk with distorted guitars that just never shut up. Jack's acoustic guitar and mellow voice are relaxing, and it's obvious that he's from hawaii.   When i first heard his new cd, i thought to myself, \\"he did it again\\". it's a good cd to listen to while cruising down PCH after a good day at the beach. <BR>anyway, this cd isn't really that different from Brushfire Fairytales.  It has the same style, but at the same time, the songs are creatively different and aren't just copies of his earlier songs. \\"taylor\\", \\"mediocre bad guys\\" and \\"cookie jar\\" are the best songs on this album. <BR>anyway, i only hope that jack stays true to his style, and doesn't change much, because he's awsome. if you liked Brushfire Fairytales, then buy this album!!!
B000000YBQ|5.0|I had just finished 11th grade, about 50  miles south of the Village Vanguard, and probably went to Presbyterian Youth Group that morning and hung around the house reading or watching TV in the afternoon and evening. Meanwhile, up at the famous club, this trio was making jazz history, recording enough tunes to end up with two LP's and 30 years later, two CD's which had room for alternate takes. Nobody knew that bass player Scott Lafaro had only ten days to live due to a traffic accident. What a shame. Bill Evans released the tunes in which Scott was featured on \\"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\\" record a few months later, and then the rest of the performances on \\"Waltz for Debbie\\" still months afterward. So these songs have a bit more Bill and a bit less bass, yet still plenty of both. It's all good, too. Mostly mellow, subtle, graceful, totally likeable stuff. The alternate takes do not seem repetitious, either. A bit of crowd noise and clanging highball glasses brings the listener right into the club. Imagine yourself sitting there with your date, a starlet in from the other coast, talking about the movie she'll start shooting in NYC soon. You look at her lips,  you perhaps undress her with your eyes, but you don't really hear what she's saying because your ears, your educated ears, will NOT be diverted from the complex and wonderful improvisations coming from the bandstand. Finally, she notices, gets mad, and says \\"Hey, it's the trio or me, pick one.\\" You make the smart and moral choice, and give her cab fare back to her hotel, telling her you're staying for the second set. And now, 42 years later, you're glad you did. You don't even recall the beauty's name, but you have the music of that day with you always, and many more Evans recordings as well. (Maybe nobody behaved that way...maybe some guys left with their dates halfway through a song...but their choice was undoubtedly regretted when the affair ended badly, while the music they failed to witness lingers on.)

074322454X|4.0|Mr. Ambrose is a great writer, and has a very good knowledge of WWII. I saw the minseries for this on TV and it is the greatest war program you will ever watch. This book just sounds like a 8th grader wrote it.  <BR>He has to talk in a third person view because he wasn't a solider, but it's boring. When he's talking about being engaged in combat, it's just dull. <BR>The book also moves quick quick quick. I suggest you read this book and watch the minseries along with it. The story of Easy Company in World War II is a brave, heartbreaking story. The men that gave up their life for World War II is greatly honored in having a story written after them. The author could have done better, but the story is aboustly amazing. You have to tell yourself &quot;this really happened&quot; every once in a while.<br />From the struggle of the training, to the suspense and a look at true war in the cold forest of Bastonge, these men did it all. This is truely a great book.
B000002B1M|5.0|This is by far one of Nas' greater albums. On albums intro you can hear words of introspect from Nas and rhyme partner, AZ, and then the party starts on the track \\"The Message\\" where Nas spits fire all over the classic N.Y. beat. Songs like \\"Affirmative Action\\", \\"Live Nigga Rap\\", \\"If I Was a Gun\\", and \\"Black Girl Lost\\" are all certified bangers. Featuring artists and producers such as Havoc and Prodigy (Mobb Deep), Foxy Brown, Dr. Dre, Cormega, AZ, and Trackmasters, this is an album you'll be bumping for a long time.
B000099T2L|1.0|I am thoroughly disappointed by Beyonce's debut album.  The songs tend to give me a headache, as she is screaming through them all.  Some of the songs have a great beat to them, but there seems to be too much going on i.e. too many sounds and beats mixed together.  I would have preferred for her to simplify the songs a bit.  I think she has great potential, but this album is not worth the purchase.
0385504209|5.0|The DaVinci Code was one I couldn't put down - a true rarity for me.  Brown has blended a wonderful array of topics into a truely suspensful story.  Stories of code breaking, religon, art history, secret societies and more are all woven together to form a fantastic story.  Highly recommended!
B000099T2L|4.0|I have been a Destiny's Child fan for years, so when Kelly Rowland's &quot;Simply Deep&quot; came out, I bought it (another EXCELLENT album, highly recommended) and so when Beyonce had this album out, of course I bought it too. <BR>Let me just say that Beyonce is SO talented and SO beautiful and that I love her and this album. It's a little too heavy on the ballads, but whatever. &quot;Baby Boy&quot; the song featuring Sean Paul is really hot, &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; is beautiful, &quot;That's How You Like It&quot;, feat. Jay Z, has a good beat, the song she collaborates on with Luther Vandross, I forget the name, is great, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; also feat. Jay Z, is really catchy, my favorite song, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot; are also some nice tracks and &quot;Signs&quot; is good but only because Missy Elliot does her thing on it. Overall it's a great album and it's worth the money.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Okay Lets Start Off By Saying This I'm A Major Fan Of Linkin Park. I Can Listen To Their Music And Relate To It.

Even though Somewhere I Belong Is The Best On This CD I Love All Their Music And Always Will Because They Never Get Old.
B00005JM09|1.0|Terminator 1 and 2 were the brainchild of James Cameron, and Terminator 3 is the invention of someone out to score a buck with the name of a great franchise. I was hoping they would let Cameron conclude this series with a sequel that would make the Terminator trilogy one that is like the first Star Wars trilogy (unsurpassable). But NOOOO. They ruin a great story with over-the-top action, a plot that is now boring and stupid, and they continually insult the true fans of the series with dumb gags (hence, a scene where Arnold takes the clothes of some erotic dancer at a male strip club...and that's not even the half of it). That theme Brad Fiedel originally created for the series has been made into something that reminded me of the Jaws sequels... its utterly forgettable now. They didn't build any suspense for this new \\"advanced\\" TX model. Everything she did was actually like watching a bad episode of Ally McBeal (where she's imagining herself doing the most outrageous stuff)....the T-1000 was so much more threatening and dangerous, and realistic. <br />Don't get me wrong, I went to this film with an open mind, even if I heard the major film studio execs screwed him out of doing this his way and that Eddie Furlong and Linda Hamilton.... (I'm a big big big fan of Cameron's work)....And when I came out of this movie, I was telling myself, \\"I knew it\\"... I knew they screwed up what they could've had with Cameron in the director's seat.<br />Lukemitch20@aol.com
0027164403|5.0|We all love this book.  It's about the only one that I have to read again and again and don't get bored with it.... Our baby loves lifting the flaps (and she's only 13 months), and smiles when we make animal noises that go along with the picture (the monkey page is the funniest!)  A great buy.
B000096I9G|4.0|I'm one of the the above 35 fans that still follows the Cure. To be honest, they started getting spotty after The Head on the Door album, to me. So,  this DVD is totally worth the price of admission if you're into the Pornography album. This group plays it with just the right mix of tension, emotion and musicianship. The light show for this set is perfect, too. The other two highlights are the two encore tracks from the Kiss Me album.<br />Both Disentegration and Bloodflowers drag a bit in spots to me. They could probably both be paired down to 8 songs each, like Pornography, and be better off for it. That's been the biggest problem of the CD age....albums are too long and bloated just because the space is available. Anyway, these are also undoubtedly fine live versions of both of those records.
0446608955|2.0|This is one of those rare cases where the movie is better than the book. I don't think Sparks did a good job of writing this one. The main character doesn't sound authentic. He sounds like an old guy trying to talk young. I don't think Sparks remembers his high school days very well. I like the story concept, but Sparks did not execute well. I recommend the movie, but not the book.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This is my favorite Wong Kar Wai film.  Slow, meditative and to some, repetitive, it is not a work that will appeal to a large audience.  Then again, very few if any of Wong's films do.  The title \\"In the mood for love\\" is somewhat misleading as it belies the nuances of the film while implying a certain sensual or carnal intimacy between the characters.  More fitting is the original Chinese tilte of the movie - loosely translated \\"years like flowers\\" - which captures what Wong is trying to convey here - the transitory nature of youth and, implicitly, the melancholy and regret from not taking advantage of the few chances one has in life for happiness.  The plot, in brief, concerns the chance encounter of a man (Leung Chiu War)and a woman (the great Maggie Cheung) who fall in love with each other in the course of discovering that their spouses have been carrying on an affair of their own.  The story unfolds in a deliberately slow pace, with wonderful use of color, slow motion, music (Nat King Cole featured prominently as well as the Chinese title song, beautifully sung and full of yearning and regret) and minimal dialogue; all of which contribute to the film's dreamy quality.  The coda, set in the twilights of Angkor Wat, is as powerful a moment in film as I have ever felt - the sense of loss felt Leung Chiu War's character is palpable and quietly heartbreaking.      The shooting of the film supposedly took quite a long time, well over one year and a lot of footages shot ended up unused.  The bonus disk gives a hint of the work in progress nature of WKW's directing style.  Some of the outtakes were actually quite different in feel than the eventual film and it is a credit to WKW's vision that he is able to fashion a beautiful work of art from disparate materials.    A film for the ages.
B000099T2L|4.0|When I first bought and listened to the album..I was kind of disappointed, but it has grown on me and I really appreciate Beyonce's talent. I was a bit surprised with the sensual lyrics, but I guess it shows who she is as an artist away from Destiny's Child. I think that Speechless, Naughty girl, Rock Star, and Be With You are the best! I think her voice sounds so wonderful.
B00005JM93|4.0|The review lostjhony wrote shows me and alot of other film lovers how singal minded people can be.<br />I agree, the opening scene is extreamly explicit and one hell of an eye opener. But the purpose of this is to show the real life destruction of beuty, which is exactly why this film is told in reverse.<br />Although the director has choosen to  destruct  beuty in such a shocking way, he has also choosen to make up for it by telling the story backwards. He is mourning the tragedy of a girl being raped and beaten by showing the audience the way it was befor the first scene, tranquil and peacefull, and at the same time showing how \\"time destroys everything\\"
B00005JM09|4.0|While I found this movie to be very enjoyable, it was as BAD as I thought it would be.  Not BAD, but as BAD as I expected.  It just did not feel very connected to the first two.  This is due mainly to a different actor playing John Connor, as well as the absence of Linda Hamilton (how I miss her!) & James Cameron.  And with a different director and studio, the special effects aren't quite the same.   <br />As for the good things: A female terminator for a change (played very well by Kristanna Doken), Arnold Schwarzenegger still being able to perform such a role despite being 56 years of age and his recent health problems, and the excitement of the movie itself.  This has a lot more action (guns, car crashes, explosions) than the first two.<br />As for the bad things: Too much comic relief by Mr. Schwarzenegger (just as I expected).  The first two were taken a lot more seriously, but there are moments when this one went too far.  I thought I was watching a self-parody.  Also, it felt a bit too short for a TERMINATOR flick.  The original was a bit shorter, but was structured better so to feel longer.  The second was way over two hours and, again, was carried out better.  A movie like this should have been a little longer.  <br />But despite its flaws, TERMINATOR 3 still passes.  Definitely go see it!
B000094A6A|2.0|There are some fine performances in this movie, just don't count Luke Wilson amoung them.  Does this guy act or just sit with an absolutely vacant expression while the movie rolls past him?  Any scene with Frank the Tank is good enough reason to buy this movie, but on the whole it's a big disapointment just because of what it could have been.  Not very funny but on occassion entertaining.  Then again, once you watch Old School, I think you'll appreciate Animal House with a quasi-religious feeling.  Old School is Old Hat, no...it's an old shoe!  My advice...wait until it comes out on USA Network, which should be soon.
B00003CXD5|5.0|As the reviewer from Melbourne notes, this superb film met with a frosty box-office reception upon its initial 1948 release. At once a grand adventure tale and a dark meditation on the less wholesome elements of human nature, TREASURE... stands as one of John Huston's (and Bogart's) finest hours. Great performances from the three leads, gorgeous scenery, a rousing (if occasionally intrusive) Max Steiner score, and a story that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining add up to state-of-the art midcentury Hollywood cinema.<br />This film has been conspicuous in its absence from the DVD shelves, but Warner is due to rectify that at the end of September with a two-disc Special Edition boasting a lovingly restored print and--I can't resist--a goldmine of supplementary material.
0553274503|5.0|With Flowers for Algernon, Daniel Keyes has created a story that has touched the hearts of millions.  In this classic novel he tells the story of Charlie, a retarded man who undergoes an experimental proceedure to make him more intelligent.  Surprisingly the process works amazingly well.  Charlie gradually gets smarter.  Eventually he would qualify as one of the most intelligent human beings in history.  There is only one problem, the process is flawed.  This flaw is emphasized when Algernon, a mouse test subject that has received the same treatment begins to regress.  The mouse eventually dies as Charlie peaks and begins to regress himself.  Unfortunately the only person smart enough to find out what is wrong is Charlie himself.  The race is on for Charlie to find a cure before his regression leaves him once more retarded, or dead.  This book is a tender, sad, and brilliant mirror on the light and darkness of the human spirit.  There is also the underlying message of 'becareful what you wish for...you may get it.'  I cannot recommend this book more highly.  You will enjoy watching Charlie realize that being intelligent doesn't mean you don't have problems.
B000002UDD|4.0|I love Megadeth. I'm a MegaFan. I've heard (and own) &quot;Rust in Peace,&quot; &quot;Hidden Treasures,&quot; &quot;Countdown to Extinction,&quot; &quot;Youthanasia,&quot; and &quot;Capitol Punishment&quot; in addition to this CD. I must say that SFSGSW is certainly another CD to add to a Megadeth fan's growing collection, but it is definitely the weakest Megadeth CD so far. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just the weakest out of all their other CDs. <br />The music is superb with amazing guitar riffs and solos, but the lyrics were lacking that special &quot;oomph.&quot; <br />A must-have for Megadeth fans, but not for the casual metalhead.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Wish I would have grabbed this one sooner!<br />Wonderfully restored footage.  Superbly remixed DTS audio. Excellent package.  This one is worth every cent.<br />A keeper that I will watch over-and-over.  Tons of features and extras to explore.<br />GET IT!
B000002MY3|5.0|I know the Net is filled with gratuitous and ubiquitous praise for this album, and we shouldn't be subjected to more. I'll still indulge because Pill is justifiably one of the best albums released in the last 10 years. Morrisette goes for the artistic sublime and reaches it convincingly with edgy guitar riffs, an amazing vocal range, and, gasp, songwriting talent that is evident as it blazes through even the weaker tracks of the album.<br />Many critics consider the cornerstone track on the album to be &quot;You Oughta know.&quot; And it is; the album gels to the 4 minute brillance. However, you've got to check out the other songs on the disc, especially &quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane.&quot; Most of the tracks demonstrate songwriting excellence, with varied chords and structures, witty lyrics, and a knack for matching music and lyrics to create songs that induce emotions and express artistic intent. A few songs fall short of this (most notably &quot;Wake Up,&quot; but most are done extremely well. Oh yes, it is also performed and produced impeccably, with Morrisette singing all over the rock map and Glen Ballard producing with ultimate precision. <br />If you want to hear something of worth from the 1990's, you'd better go and buy this album. It has everything and more. You won't be sorry.
B00009P1O2|2.0|...<br />Watched 3-4 songs.  The video is mediocre.  The audio (DTS believe it or not) is bland and flat.  The vocals are extremely hot in the mix, and the instruments are nowhere to be found.  No bottom end.  Poor dynamics... <br />Once again, don't trust every review here.  Some people get too attached to a particular musician or group and overlook the poor presentation of the DVD.  As much as I like the music, I can't overlook the lackluster and half-baked audio and video.<br />SKIP THIS ONE...
B00005JLWN|5.0|It is easy to see that this movie is low budget and that many of the ideas were borrowed.  However, the message put forth and the quality of action are astounding.  Personally I think the action sequences are a step up from the Matrix Reloaded because I'm not one for CGI.  This is the real deal.  The gun kata is an amazing concept.  For anyone who has taken martial arts, they know a kata is an organized series of forms that could be used in a multiple attacker situation.  The fact that guns are used in this type of form and you still remaining in a stationary position, you just have to see it.  Then with the story, well, its a bit slow.  The message is there though right in your face.  This is definately a movie that will make you think and due to the low budget, a cult classic for this genre.
B0000041LA|1.0|Well, may be I can give one more star for his technique...After all he did learn all the 5 concertos. But what is the point? I have to admit that his first recording of complete Chopin etudes, when he recorded all of them on one breath, is amazing. But lately I feel like he's lost passion for music. Only technique, only fingers and NO heart whatsoever. Oh well...But if you want to remember the performance, listen to Vladimir Krainev! Trust me on this one!!! I know what I am talking about. Sometimes quantity does not make the quality better.
B000066NW0|4.0|If you just want to find trite, simplistic music, there is plenty of it available, from Britney to Madonna.  Just because the genre is alternative does not mean the lyrics have to be Dylan-esque to qualify.  I first heard &quot;I'm With You&quot; not too long after a divorce and it lifted me out of my car seat, and I am not generally considered &quot;shallow,&quot; and it sure wasn't &quot;puppy love.&quot;  With a huge alternative hit, she is crying all of the way to the bank with all of this sharp criticism, I am sure.  Also, when critiquing alternative female artists, especially Canadians, everyone feels the need to evoke the name Alanis as the height to which to aspire.  Sure, I love Alanis and admire her as someone who made it on sheer originality and emotional outreach, not to mention some great songs, but I am willing to bet that when Alanis hears Avril, she is at least a little bit envious of her voice.  That brings me to the next point, Avril has a helluva set of pipes, and the recording sounds magnificent.  That still counts for something with me, at least.  Get used to it guys, this kid is going to be around for quite a while!
0385507755|1.0|Let me admit, at the outset, that I haven't read James Frey's A Million Little Pieces in its entirety.  I feel that when one reads a book, you enter into a sort of contract with the author to read it in its entirety, if that is how it's meant to be read, as novels are.  However, I found this book to be unreadable.  It's not that it was boring or that the plot didn't move forward or that the characters were unbelievable, although all these things are true.  Every time I sat down to read this book, I found myself actually feeling embarrased for the author.  <br />This is a book about addiction.  I began reading it because I recently read Infinite Jest, another book about addiciton and one of the most fascinating and poignant books I've ever read.  However, in A Million Little Pieces, James Frey's major failing is his inability to convey the complexity and subtleties of addicts' personalities and behaviours.  All the addicts I encountered in this book were cliches.  The dialogue was trite.  And frankly, I don't give a damn how it ends.
B000002HRE|4.0|This is a very good album. Even though it is a step down from their older stuff, it is still great. My favorites are: Fuel, The Memory Remains, Devils Dance (cool bass intro), The Unforgiven II (instant classic), Better Than You, Slither, Carpe Diem Baby (catchy lyrics), Bad Seed (souinds like old school stuff).
0783225857|5.0|The Book is usually always better than the movie.  In this case the movie does the book justice. The little girl who plays scout is so beleivable and Gregory Peck is such a wonderful actor.  The book is one of the best ever written.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I GUESS WHEN YOU ARE Spielberg OR KUBRICK YOU CAN MAKE ANY PIECE OF GARBAGE YOU WANT.<br />NOT A GOOD STORY. SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE NOTHING NEW. A LONG TEAR JERKER BASED ON A POOR UNDERSTANDING TECHNOLOGY. THE KID PLAYING THE LEAD NEEDS ACTING LESSONS.<br />TOO LONG, TOO BORING. THIS IS MADE FOR TV MOVIE STUFF.
B000067CPX|5.0|I have been a RHCP fan since 1991.  It's torture waiting each time for them to relese a new album, but the wait for &quot;By the Way&quot; was so worth it.  I didn't think it was possible to match the amazing sounds of Californication, but they've done it.  I love this cd; it has not left my cd player since its release last year.  I agree that you must have this cd!
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a great album.  Every single song is great.  It's not profound or musically challenging but appreciate it for what it is: great catchy pop songs.  If you like the Avril songs you've heard on the radio (Complicated, Skater Boy), you'll definitely love this.<br />Also check out the following songs by her which are not available on the album:  &quot;I Don't Give&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;.<br />Other artists and albums in a similar style I would recommend:<BR>Michelle Branch - Spirit Room<BR>Michelle Branch - Hotel Paper<BR>Liz Phair - Liz Phair
0395951054|4.0|I have just spent some time reading this book for the first time, and I can only come to the conclusion that most of the reviews of this book are written by people who have not read the book.  <br />Hitler makes profoundly accurate indictments of modern internationalism and anti-culture.  For anyone who has some understanding of how empty our modern culture is, this book will have a great deal of meaning.<br />The Jewish Question is a rather minor point in this book, and contrary to popular belief you will find no evidence for the Holocaust in Mein Kampf.  <br />Overall, this book is not about Racism, but cultural unity.  Race is perhaps a part of cultural unity but Hitler does not argue such a point in the way most would think. In this modern era of anti-internationalism known as anti-globalization, you will find in this work the first thorough criticism of the obliteration of group culture both in economics and art.  <br />I find Hitler's writing style to be very personal, and genuine. Despite whatever one may think of his conclusions, he writes with a passion that is rare.  In the future, this book will be much more appreciated as it was the first articulated reaction to our modern times.  One thing is absolutely certain, the path humanity is currently following will ultimately fail.  This book is an early attempt to explain why human existence is much more than having food, clothing, and shelter.
B0000640VO|4.0|You dont even have to pay attention to what's going on to enjoy this movie.  The color in Amelie is gorgeous.  In the second DVD the director comments on how he wanted to imitate an particular artist by using reds and greens throughout the whole movie.  Every so often you can find glowing blue accents, which make this movie a pleasure to just surrendur your eyes to.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've had this album for quite a while now, and it's only recently that I'm really coming to appreciate its brilliance.  I mean, I always enjoyed it, from the very first listen, but I never really fully appreciated it for what it is.  I always simply saw it as a good album, not a great one.<br />So, a short while after buying this album, the new release, \\"Lateralus\\", came out.  This is an album that quite simply floored me.  It is such a meticulous and well-played album, and it just gets better and better with every spin.  I had never been a huge Tool fan prior to owning this disc, but this one album completely changed the way I looked at this band.  Well, maybe I shouldn't say changed it, but rather, it enhanced it.  Yeah, that works.<br />So anyway, after buying and loving \\"Lateralus\\", I couldn't help but notice the exponential margin by which I preferred that album to this one.  This band put out such a phenomenal album, I thought to myself.  Why don't I enjoy the others this much?  So, I decided that this needed yet another spin.  I can't describe it, but after hearing \\"Lateralus\\", and realizing the full scope of what Tool is capable of, listening to this album was a completely different experience. I'm noticing every texture, every subtle nuance, and I can't describe what I'm hearing as anything short of incredible.  The weird segues in between songs that served as such a distraction before suddenly feel like they should actually be there.  Ok, so \\"Ions\\" is still WAY longer than it needs to be, but it's really not that big of a setback. And, it sounds really cool when listened to in headphones.<br />I also attained a greater appreciation for the musicianship. I'd never been largely impressed by Adam Jones's playing, now I see that he is a very creative and talented guitarist. Not really mind-blowing technically, but the dense, gritty atmospheres he creates on this album are a large part of what makes this such a cool and unique experience to listen to.  And, of course, Danny Carey rules.  I always knew that, but hey, who says you can't enjoy a good thing just a little bit more, huh?  His drumming is insanely complex, yet at the same time very unique and diverse.  From the tribal-like beats of \\"Eulogy\\", to the furious double-bass of \\"Forty Six and Two\\", he never gets boring, and never fails to impress.<br />And hey, we can't forget Maynard, can we?  He's an excellent singer, and he just gets better and better.  His melodic tone is nearly hypnotizing in its beauty, and the emotional power is overwhelming.  Aside from that, he's an insanely talented composer.  Some of these songs, such as \\"Eulogy\\" and \\"Third Eye\\", may seem a bit long-winded and drawn out at first, but after a while, you come to appreciate the subtleties, and the songs sort of \\"take form\\", so to speak. This writing style has only gotten even more fantastic on \\"Lateralus\\", which is an even more epic, and even more brilliant album.<br />One thing you've gotta remember about Tool is that all of their albums are vastly different from each other.  If you go in expecting one to sound like the other, you'll be disappointed.  Maynard once said somewhere that beliefs will only corrupt you and hold you down, therefore it is wiser to believe in nothing (sorry if I butchered that quote, I'm really just paraphrasing there), and listening to their albums seems to reflect this standpoint.  They seem to like to keep everyone on their toes, and let everyone know that they are far from a predictable band.  This is just my opinion, but I really think there should be more bands like this.<br />I could go into greater specifics, about how great \\"Stinkfist\\", the title track, and \\"Forty Six and Two\\" are, but hopefully these songs are well-known enough to where they don't need to be discussed further.  But, the goodness doesn't stop there. There are lots of great songs here, such as \\"Eulogy\\", \\"H\\", \\"Third Eye\\", \\"Jimmy\\"...well, pretty much the whole thing.  The album may seem a bit uniform at first, but like I said, the songs sort of take form, and assume their own identity with time.<br />I think it goes without saying that this album (or for that mater, this band in general) is not for everyone, but listening to Tool is like a strange and perplexing journey, and I think everyone should take this journey once, just to see where it takes you.  You never know, it could enrich your life in ways you never thought possible.  With every album, Tool just gets more and more amazing, and I can't wait to hear what they'll come up with next.form at first, but like I said, the songs sort of take form, and assume their own identity with time.  <br />I think it goes without saying that this album (or for that mater, this band in general) is not for everyone, but listening to Tool is like a strange and perplexing journey, and I think everyone should take this journey once, just to see where it takes you.

B00000IL1K|5.0|A friend of mine had recommended this CD. At the time, I had never heard of Sarah Brightman but when I got her CD, I was amazed. She has the voice of an angel and I have never heard a voice with that sense of clarity. The tracks Eden and Deliver Me are some of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I am under the spell of Sarah Brightman.<br />Thanks Bernie!
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell is amazing.<br />Being a 16-year old girl swamped by emotionless top-40 music and the pressure to be like the \\"role models\\" that sing it, Joni proves to be a refreshing escape TO reality. Listening to Blue for the first time through completely, I was awestruck by her ability to twist generally quiet instruments and concepts into such complex music with loud presence. I shivered with her lonely, aching piano on soulful \\"Blue\\", I danced to the upbeat and springy \\"Carey\\" \\"California\\" and \\"All I Want\\", I cried with her desperate wails on \\"River\\"--and so much more.<br />The lyrics alone paint watercolors in the mind of the listener, the melodies draw them in. Joni Mitchell created a masterpiece of beautiful, poignant music that will never go out of style.
B00006F7S4|5.0|It's realy sad and also you will get addicted to it.<BR>I didn't use to believe these things when I read them in the reviews,but when I bought the album I foun it truely depressing or better to say good for you when you'r depressed or need a few tears.<BR> It's realy good.
B000002UAR|1.0|To me it's this simple - this recording is almost 40 years old.  It's supposed to sound dated, out of style, orchestral - and it delivers. <br />Even the better songs like Taxman, although having a good beat, are simple.  The awful Eleanor Rigby, Here There and Everywhere, Love You To, and I'm Only Sleeping barely fit into the category of rock music, and are more likely categorized as Easy Listening.<br />Those that are just discovering the Beatles and claim they are &quot;blown away&quot; by the likes of this, or Sgt. Pepper, are either exaggerating or haven't listened to much of the great music of today.  There's no need to dredge up the past.
B000002KKS|5.0|While I am a purist and I believe that Ozzy, as well as Tony Iommi, was the heart of Black Sabbath, one cannot be a rock fan and deny that this album is good in its own right.  This incarnation of Sabbath is good in its own right.  One cannot deny the power of Ronnie James Dio's Voice.  He sings with a passion.  Iommi also did some of his better guitar work on Neon Knights, Children of the Sea and Heaven and Hell.  This is not<br />Black Sabbath of the Paranoid era.  This is an entirely different animal.  While this is not the original Black Sabbath, Dio Sabbath still rocks
B00005JM09|4.0|I was expecting a LOT MORE machine vs human combat sequences, like the promo teasers lead you to believe, but didn't get that.  The battle scenes were pretty good though and the chase scenes, especially the one when she is driving that crain was AWESOME!  I don't even want to think about all the preparations they went through for that shoot - it was spectacular.<br />The storyline was excellent too.  The two hours passed VERY QUICKLY and there was a nice mix of character development, action, suspense and humor!  Yes, the whole audience was laughing out loud at Arnold's Terminator humor - hilarious.  I think the strongest element of this movie was it's ability to CLEARLY point to part 4.  An excellent job of paving the way for a sequel.  One of the best I've seen since Star Wars in 1977.<br />I did have to dock the movie one star though.  The previews falsly lead me to believe there was going to be some MAJOR robotic combat scenes (metal terminators, space ships, explosions, etc - not just the normal human forms vs human forms) but it lacked.<br />Overall, it's well worth your dollar to see it in the theatres.  Just be prepared for a good action/drama movie and not so much a sci-fi thriller with robots/robotic images taking the center stage.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Every once in a while there is an outlet from &quot;mainstream&quot; music, and this is one of them.  The same type of outlet that Nirvana provided in the 90's.  Their music didn't change much stylistically through each album.  For those of you who say that this is just more of the same from the first album release, consider that when you are an artist, if you have been playing for a while, you have more material than you could publish at one time.  Most of the songs that appear on this album probably could have shown up on Brushfire.  Look at 10,000 Maniacs...first album was polished and over-produced (to them), but people ate it up.  Ms. Merchant hated it.  As she branched out, her music became her own, but not too far from center.  I think that Jack might be in the same instance although I think that the music and the prodcution are his influence, so while the first cd (I think I dated myself later with my album reference) was more polished to get radio buy-in, I think that it is safe to say this is a transition cd for him and the band. They have a lot of talent, and many different things that they can try in the future. The album grows on you over time. You'll notice centrally themed songs, but once you let it go it becomes like an early Beatles album..just good listening.  Anyway, it is a nice break if you like to mix up your musical styles.  And if you get the chance, see him live...you'll appriciate it more.  The last two songs on the cd seal the deal for me.  I think that it is a great piece of work!
B00006JIAF|5.0|The Strokes are just fun is that so wrong, what it's not cool to have fun anymore. Well if is pick up this album it's great. Is this it is kinda slow but good. The Modern Age is a sheer visceral thrill. Soma is probably the best song on the album, the ending is great. Barely Legal is a song that is great in the car. Someday should be played at every graduation instead of that stupid green day song. the next is a great filled with great solos. Hard to Explain is kind of an 80's flasback at first. The next is a very good jumpy song. The next is a heartfelt song that is amazing. And finally Take it Or Leave it is a fast paced roller coaster. And the DVD is icing on the cake.
0688163173|5.0|I read Prayers for Rain and really enjoyed it; this book is even better! LeHane is a master at writing dialogue. This book has so much punch and is a very gripping, compelling read. LeHane plays head games with you up until the end where you feel as crazy as the patients at Shutter Island! I had a great time reading it, hopefully it will be made into a movie. For some reason I see Tom Cruise in the role of Teddy Daniels....
B00009L1TA|5.0|This movie is very suspenseful and very well made.  Keeps you wondering throughout the movie and has an unpredictable plot and ending.  Best movie I've seen in a while.
B000002J09|5.0|While many would debate which Led Zeppelin was the best, I can tell you that this is it.  Every track is a classic.  This belongs in every music collector's library. This is not just worthwhile for Stairway alone. It shifts from crunching numbers like Black Dog and When the Levee Breaks to acoustic numbers like The Battle of Evermore and Going to California.  Yet it all fits together so seemlessly.  While everybody is entitled to their own opinions on music, if you do not appreciate this, there is something seriously wrong with you.  Jimmy Page and the gang turned their music into an art form on this one and yet it was also a very unpretentious effort.
B00005JM09|5.0|Arnold returns and he's pulling out all the stops! Another assasin is out to get Conner and one of his long-time \\"friends\\" and it's up to the new Terminator to keep him alive and well through Judgement Day. This presents a challenge seeing as how the evil android is about 100X stronger than him and the long-awaited Judgement Day comes in 3 hours! Will he suceed or fail his mission? And can Conner stop Judgement Day and save the Earth? Believe me, you'll be suprised at how it turns out! <br />This movie is totally action-packed! There isn't one dull moment. One minute a car chase, an explosion, a cool line, someone dies, and the next minute the same thing! And Arnold's serious attitude makes him funny in some situations! For instance, he steals all the food out of a shop and- well I won't spoil it, but he's one cool G- for a robot. <br />The fight scenes are really spectacular. Lot's of crashing and explosions. It comes as close to the Matrix Reloaded without using too much 3D as any movie can get! Same thing with the car chases, except a lot more fire. <br />This has got to be one of the best continuing plot lines out there, along with The Matrix and Star Wars. There are many twists and turns in the plot, making this movie all the more fun to enjoy. I might go see it again! This is one adventure you'll want to go see again and again!
B00005YW4H|4.0|This album is so romantic and soothing.  My only problem with it is that I kind of burnt myself out on it pretty fast.  The simplicity of the lyrics and musical composition are part of it's appeal but also make it less interesting after it's played a while.
0788812807|5.0|The girl from the right side of the tracks and the guy from the wrong side of the tracks. This movie is about Lady, a pampered pure bred Cocker Spanial, who is the love of her owner's lives. Then a baby comes along. While this doesn't change her owner's feelings about her, they leave her with mean ole Aunt Sarah while they go on vacation. Aunt Sarah's two siamese cats get Lady into trouble and Sarah puts a muzzle on her. Lady runs away and meets Tramp, a streetwise and kindhearted mutt who always evades the dog catcher. Tramp teaches Lady there is more to life than a leash and collar.<br />When Lady is captured by the dog catcher, she finds out that Tramp is a ladies man, so to speak. After she goes back home, she is stuck outside in a doghouse. She tells off Tramp and right after she does, she sees a rat go into the baby's room. Tramp saves the baby from the rat and ultimatly is saved from death by Lady's owners. Shows that you can't always judge a book by it's cover.
B00005JM09|4.0|I told many people that this new Terminator movie would have no gray area, it will either be great or it will be a disaster.  This was judging by the trailers.  I just saw the first showing matinee today and I will say that this is a great action film marred by a bad trailer.  The film has some big lapses in logic at times yes and a few scenes make you wonder how far it will go, but the film doesn't fail on two counts.  1 - it is absolutely fun and 2 - if there is a fourth one, they found the perfect way to end this film as it has one of the best endings to a movie you'll see and you won't see it coming.<br />T3 also has some great moments of humor as well.  Arnold in one scene trying on some new eyewear and in another, his responce to a gas station attendant who tries to stop him from stealing.  The latter scene shows a little in the way of how we learned that Terminators can learn from watching other people.  Another humorous scene comes from the re introduction of Dr. Silberman, who was the psych doctor in the first two movies.<br />The villian is the TX an advanced prototype who is designed as an assassin of not only her targets, but of other Terminators.  Arnolds T800 character even admits that he's no match for it.  In the form of a blonde woman the TX is two steps forward and one step back from the T1000 from T2.  She can change shape like the T1000, but can form more advanced weapons like laser guns instead of just knives and hooks and is able to tap into and controll other machines.  However, during the course of the movie, she actually can get hurt which is a big contrast from T1000 who still remains one of the most unbeatable villians ever.  Some of the action scenes between Arnie and TX are spectacular and are not drawn out.  The fight in the bathroom is particularly amuseing (urinals make handy weapons).<br />The plot sadly is nothing new.  Arnolds mission is to protect John Conner who is now a drifter to avoid possible detection from any other Terminator.  A woman named Kate gets cut in the action and needs protection also because she will also paly an important part in the future and her dad is the creator of Skynet, the future computer network that starts the nuclear war.  TX is after John, Kate, her dad and others who are to be future leaders as well.<br />T3 could've been a little better and it misses on some of the emotional strings and messages about our future.  It doesn't let up on action nor is it boring and as I said above it is even quite amusing with some rather not so subtle actions on Arnolds part that his character would take as common place.  Bottom line is that if this is the last movie Arnold makes, he'll go out on a high note since he certainly could go out on a lower one.  I plan on being back to watch this one again.  P.S.  * To anyone who says that there shouldn't even be a third Terminator film due to the lack of evidance of Terminators at the end of the second movie, Arnolds missing arm that he pryed off in the gears in the steel mill in T2 should be all the evidance there needs to be.ator.

B000092ZYX|5.0|What's interesting is that the album doesn't have that one song that smites as number one on the Billboard charts but Amnesiac and Kid A where exactly the same except that as you listened to the entire album, some parts naturally rise to the top, which demonstrates that you can't really skip around at first, from beginning to end, the radiohead narrative is in effect and evokes the listener, pulling him along this crawling, gradual path of swells and sandbars. There's traces of British rock and roll history or roots as you might call them, more so than on any other radiohead album, but the traces are just that, minute quantities of glimmer and technique as oppose to right out plagerism, there's the Sex Pistols, the The Clash and streams of The Cure a la Faulkner. Grade A stuff, and extremely pleasurable to hear and hardly any of it sounds fit for radio, which is a good thing. Thank goodness God invented satellite radio.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is the true Black Sabbath album.  It has the cuts that made them famous (i.e. Paranoid, War Pigs, Iron Man).  It also helped define what heavy metal was by being the first true heavy metal album.   This was the first album that truly assulted the ears from beginning to end.  They took it up a notch or two from their debut.  They also showed how scary music could be. Electric Funeral is one of the scariest songs that I have ever heard.  Nothing before this album came close to being as in your face, loud, ominous and menacing as Paranoid.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Yes. Listen to this album, then listen to it again. Once you are done, turn it over, then over again (as you should always do with CDs) and listen to it. Following this, proceed to hit the back-track button as many times as you feel necessary (though twelve should suffice) to get back to the first track, at which point you should listen to this album again.<br />This is not because I feel it is the greatest album of all time, amongst those for the 90's, or certainly that of 97. It is because once done correctly, you start to hear the album not as a grouping of 12 well constructed songs, but as a single album. Nothing here is going to make you tap your toes in an urge to get up and dance, and nothing here is going to make you scream and pump your fists. Instead, you're listening to the most eye-narrowing, painful squelch of melancholy introspection you could have conceived.<br />The album runs from the creatively inspired \\"Airbag\\" to the almost wistful \\"The Tourist\\", and in between adds nine additional songs (ten if you include the rather direct voice-emulated drone of Fitter Happier), all of which in their unique way give off the ideas of a cold, linear world spiraling down to a fearful nazir, though instead of demanding change, cower in the corner and cry helplessly. It's a tough emotion to catch the first seventeen times or so through the album (aha! my opening paragraph starts to make sense now ;) but it slowly grows on you, then kicks your arse into the corner and demands you loathe what's happening to people around you.<br />By listen seventy-three or so, you should be at the point where you disdain the culminated dumbing-down of the social media and the strange parade of sheep-like followings that seem to come from each new release. You should be scared and mad at your government for making itself too weak, or too strong perhaps, to do anything about the problems around you. You should most certainly have memorized every crooned lyric, harmonic fuzz, and guitar lick on it. Additionally, consider changing your license plate to OK COMP.<br />Listen one-hundred-six is noteworthy, as you pick up the small bip you forgot was there after listen twelve, right there in the middle of Subterranean Homesick Alien. Good you recalled it - the fact you thought of it reminds you to listen to it twice more today.<br />The most important thing about this album isn't that it bridges the later, less accessible work in Kid A and Amnesiac from earlier works The Bends and Pablo Honey - because it doesn't do that at all - but that it is a complete album much in the way \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Zaireeka\\", and such other albums were. There's a distinct quality to the entirety of its design, and the band itself deserved every ounce of praise from the music industry for what was essentially hailed as an attempt to revitalize the rock music scene from a slow death.<br />...P>And so it's left at this - OK Computer is the best album of 1997 and probably #3 for the 90's behind two nameless albums (it would not be fair to force the makers of an album to have to carry the burden of being better than OK Computer, which is almost impossible) and in my, if not most, top 20 albums of all time. Let's be fair - you'd put them there too if you hated pop...which isn't dead after all. The rotting stench of it must have confused the poor lads from Oxford. Either that, or my sarcasm-ometer is broken again.
0788812408|5.0|This movie is excellent all the way around. The animation is breathtaking, the music is wonderful and the story line is great. Ariel, the little mermaid, disobeying her father, King Triton's, orders to stay away from the surface, rescues Prince Eric from drowning and falls in love with him. Ursela,the sea witch, uses this to her advantage to gain control of the sea. Overall, this movie shows that love conquers all. A great movie for all ages.
B00008LDPU|3.0|I was really psyched to get this DVD, and would spend all night downloading the previews from the website before it's release.  Unfortunately, the best clips are the ones that are available for free download off of the site, and the extras really didn't add much to me.  The only exception is the short entitled &quot;Beyond&quot; which is an incredible story about a glitch in the Matrix.  Here's the play-by-play:<br />1.  Final Flight of the Osiris:  CGI short by Square (Final Fantasy) which is the setup for the invasion of Zion.  It's okay, but I'm not a big fan of Square's CGI work (the characters look too artificial and creepy for me).<br />2.  The Second Renaissance (2 parts):  Supposedly, this was the first idea for the Matrix &quot;prequel&quot; but now redone as a short anime.  Essential viewing for those who want to know how the whole Matrix got started, and tells the tale of the AI revolution, and how the sky was scorched.  #3 in rank for me.<br />3.  Kid's Story:  Uh...that annoying twerp that bothers Neo when he returns to Zion in Reloaded?  This is his story.  Doesn't make him any more sympathetic in my opinion.<br />4.  Program:  Predictable story, but great great great samurai action!<br />5.  World Record:  An athelete's record breaking run violates the parameters of the Matrix.  Just weird.  <br />6.  Beyond:  The best in the bunch, sweet tale about some kids who find a glitch in the Matrix.  Incredible animation, and the voice acting here is the best on the whole disc.<br />7.  A Detective Story:  From the maker of the popular Cowboy Bebop.  A private investigator searches for Trinity.  Outstanding story and an anime version of Trinity!  The #2 tale on the disc.<br />8.  Matriculated:  From the maker of Aeon Flux.  Human commandos capture and retrain machines.  If you saw that, you've seen this.  Makes little sense, and ends badly.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Other reviews express far more eloquently what I would have...<BR>Great album..Terrific intro to Iron Maiden for newcomers.<BR>But one slight thing - anyone notice that the intro to Blood Brothers sounds awfully like the riff from Orion..??
6304479689|5.0|I have seen some interesting reviews so far about horrible video taping and even some 'Elvis is decline' comments.  This movie is a documentary, basically cameras following Elvis around on tour.  This is not taped in Las Vegas. In Vegas, Elvis did 2 shows a day with no travel.  When on tour, it was night after night of traveling from City to City, show after show.  There are not 2,000 fans in the audience, more like 12,000-21,000 depending upon the city.  He attitude between shows in Vegas and shows on the road are understandably different.  A little less polished, a little more raw, and on ocassion a lot more powerful.  I love the Vegas shows, but if you want to see Elvis 'on tour' this is the ONLY way to get close.  I doubt I'll ever experience anything quite like it again, but I'll always have this video.  The video does not portray very well what a concert is like, the highs and lows that happen from beginning to end.  Again, it is the closest thing we have to remember by. As for Elvis going down hill, this was not long after Thats the way it is and just before Aloha in January of 1973.  Had I named this movie, it would have been 'Elvis Unleashed'.  Its a shame we don't have one those tour shows available from end to end.
B00005JLRT|1.0|Nemesis, what can I say or do that would brighten the sad and disappointing thoughts that go through my mind when I think of this movie?<BR>Living in a country where the movie theaters are not so up to date as the ones in North America, I had to wait for the DVD version. The first thing that you would notice is how marginal all the characters are in the movie , as marginal as the plot itself. The whole movie revolves around captain Pickard and his romulan  raised clone (who by the way happens to own a powerful weapon), and how the captain battles with himself to finally decide to ram over his \\"nemesis\\" with the Enterprise (destroying yet another ship in the process)  to save the federation, and kill data in the process . I sat there and wondered, if the romulans had this wonder weapon to destroy practically anything and a spaceship to match, why did they need to replicate Pickard and then drag him half way cross the galaxy to tell him that?? They could have just shown up uninvited and destroyed earth, that would have solved their problem for ever wouldn't it?! I still wonder! The story is so unworthy of the history and effort that was put into the next generation for the past 15 years or so! <BR>Most of the characters had only a few lines and hardly had a role. You would have to depend on your knowledge of the characters to imagine what they could be doing through out the movie. And even Troy who had more to say than the rest put together (except data and the captain) changed from this compassionate forgiving person to a vindictive character seeking revenge from some Romulan who invaded her mind! So unlike her!  Nothing in this movie reminds me of  Gene Roddenberry's STNG! Nothing of the spirit or the morality of STGN! Nothing at all!<BR>I had to go back and watch several of my favorite STGN episodes and all 3 previous movies to wash out the bad taste this movie left behind.<BR>In my opinion There are several star trek books already published that would have made wonderful movies, Nemesis is not one of them. <BR>This is not the way I want to remember what could be the last of  Star Trek: the Next Generation, the Enterprise and all of it's wonderful crew. Star Trek was always about hope and how humanity should seek to better itself. always gave me something to look forward to and something to hope for. This movie killed all that. If you are a serious Star Trek fan you will be disappointed to tears.
B00003CXQX|5.0|First of all, the voice cast of this movie is amazing. Eartha Kitt is the heart of the movie, at least for me. The spoiled selfish emporer Kuzkoh gets what was coming to him. Yzma's left hand man of the moment Kronk is hilarious and kept me laughing the whole time.
B000060MWU|2.0|Just thought I'd warn all the connoisseurs that, yes, this is in fact the pan and scan version.  My advice:  wait for the new U.S. release.  As for the movie itself:  standard David Lynch fare:  entertaining and incomprehensible--good stuff.
B00004XOWM|3.0|O.k,Ill admit this right now:Yes,i do own this record.Yes,i used to love this record and YES,i used to think they were the coolest thing around!Now im getting sick of them,but i dont understand why do you people hate them so much,i mean,sure,there are a lot of bands out there much better than Limp Bizkit(Nirvana,Led Zepellin,Rammstein just to name a few),but there also a lot of joke bands out there that make Limp Bizkit look like Queen Elizabeth (Alien Ant Farm,Anyone?????????)<BR>Ihonestly dont understand why there are so many &quot;good&quot; reviews!
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium is a new film starring many people I never even heard of, and a few familiar face character actors from European cinema. All in all this movie was a shade better than the &quot;Brave New World&quot; miniseries that aired on the major networks a few years ago. That is to say it wasn't that good, but neither was it bad. It is a highly derivative work of past films, tv shows, literatute, and video games.  The acting was a tad cheesy, although I think it was meant to be given the SF premise that &quot;Emotion is Illegal&quot;. The wooden actor (Christian Bale) came across as fairly genuine in the parts he played &quot;emotional&quot;.  Kudos to him for playing it like Keanu in the Matrix. The movie wanted to be The Matrix (I picked it up as it was advertised to &quot;blow away the Matrix&quot;) so bad that it kind of stunk up the place with its more strained efforts. However, there were some really phenomenally great action scenes, and it's always good to see Sean Bean in another movie, even if he got killed off rather sharpish. As a major theatrical release? It stinks. As a B-movie or just a rental it comes off as amazingly well done (especially for fans of sci-fi television and classic authors like Orwell). So, with that in mind, I shall give Equilibrium a solid B rating, with kudos to Christian Bale and the director for creating a 2 hour version of an Outer Limits episode.
B0000025YL|3.0|After Restless and Wild was released, the dam broke and Accept started getting much more attention. Contains the song \\"Fast as a Shark\\", perhaps one of the first speed metal songs ever featuring drummer Stefan Kaufmann using double bass drums. Wolf Hoffman's guitar playing is awsome. Udo's shriek is annoying sometimes, but grows on you. Some of Accept's songs have a classical influence to them which I enjoy. Only downer about this particular CD is there are a few production flaws; some of the guitar and drum tracks on a couple of songs are too dry, i.e. they sound kinda like demos...which is odd because not all of the songs on the CD are like that. Also the ending of the song Princess of the Dawn is chopped off. Maybe they were rushed to get this album out. They wouldn't make the same mistake on the next one though (Balls to the Wall).
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie is about Simba, a young lion prince, and shows his life as he grows up. The hardships of his father being killed, his uncle making him believe it was his fault, and trying to run away from his past. In the end, he challenges his uncle to the throne and the truth about his father's death comes out. A great movie explaining the circle of life, coming of age and coming to terms with death as well as facing the past.
0375823360|5.0|These books were amazing. Phillip Pullman has a great imagination and has written these books wonderfully. They are full of adventure, creatures that are only seen in your imagination, and well written, I would recommend these books. If you love Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, try these out. They are super and really good!
B00005JKZT|4.0|I truly loved the movie however it does not follow the storyline very well. The book was here first. And it seems as if they created a remotely different story instead. I have been reading this book over and over since I was ten. This movie could have and should have been better. However I am hoping that the third and final movie will make up for it.  (And quite a few of the male actors are hot)
B00008DDXC|4.0|For lovers of the book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; is yet another wonderful adaptation true to Rowling's text. While some elements (such as the Deathday Party) must be cut for time limits, the most charming elements are still present -- the annoying self-pushing Gilderoy Lockhart, the fantastic climax in the Chamber, the encounter with the Whomping Willow, and our introduction to the sinister Lucius Malfoy, who makes his son Draco look like a kitten in contrast.<br />The story hinges around a premise of prejudice which is slowly seeping into Hogwarts. Harry and his friends must solve the mystery of why some of their fellow students are winding up Petrified by an unknown &quot;monster&quot; said to be controlled by the Heir of Slytherin. In the meantime, Harry must deal with a new adversary on the Quidditch field, a bothersome house-elf, an annoying new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and his own fears that he might partially be responsible.<br />The children have really grown into their roles. Daniel Radcliffe seems right at home portraying everyone's favorite little wizard. Emma Watson's Hermione is beautiful, intelligent, and a joy to watch. But it's Rupert Grint who will have you laughing into the night with his charming, utterly predictable Ron Weasley, who has an aversion to spiders and a newly broken wand that likes to backfire. The film builds to an intense climax with a shocking conclusion and leaves you breathless for the next movie adaptation and the joys it will behold for the faithful fan.<br />The DVD is of the highest quality with good sound, excellent transition to widescreen, and some nice features. There are several cast interviews, an interesting documentary on how the films are made, and a great interview with the screenwriter and J.K. Rowling herself. The only thing missing is the director's commentary. Perhaps by the time &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; hits rental stores, Warner Bros will have understood thatthe grownups in the audience would appreciate a good commentary or two. Overall it's a great disk of an even better story.
0688163173|4.0|Having read the majority of D. L's books, this one did not seem to fit into any of his previous categories.  It was excellent, albiet, stupefying.  Upon finishing the novel, it still isn't clear what has actually happened.  It's rather Kafkaesque.  Bless good old Teddy.  He's the only one who does his best to make sense of an extemely contrived and impossible situation.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to a Leaf--<BR>If you like music too easily; chances are great that it is nothing more than ear candy, and that rots your mind. You should like it, but there should be an aspect of something missing in a very present manner; something that makes you uncomfortable in a comforting way. It's complex, and it has to try to give you one. Radiohead has once again succeded in making music in a musical manner.  Nature is found electronically, and Alexander Pope might be proud. It's the absence of relief, Hail to the Thief, so, in this way, there is always HOPE.<BR>(Radiohead won't ever rot your mind; no matter how hard it tries.)
B000002LOE|3.0|REM has always and will always keep in time with their music. This smash album has the number one hit LOSING MY RELIGION. SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE and ME IN HONEY has the band's employed guest Kate Pierson of the B-52's. Like any other band,REM needed to vocally cool down with ENDGAME. There are no sung words on BELONG. The words heard are spoken. One of the top-selling albums in 1991.
B00005JM09|3.0|The good news: T3 is a lot better than most of the Mostow-bashing folks (Like me) were expecting. The bad news: It's still not that great.<br />Watching \\"Terminator 3\\" was a lot like watching an imitation of \\"Terminator 2\\" and wishing that I could watch the real thing instead. And, in many respects, that's exactly what T3 is; an imitation.<br />For really great fans of the first two films, there are a lot of subtle details that really make a difference in the atmosphere. Brad Fiedel has been replaced as a composer - this actually is a noticeable difference, especially since virtually no music in T3 is synthesized (Or at least, it didn't SOUND like the Terminator style). Mostow's direction is somehow less interesting than Cameron's, and much less mysterious - part of the thrill of the first two Terminators for me was the suspense. Kyle wasn't really necessary, so he could easily die, Sarah Connor versus the T-1000 could end in any way without really affecting the fate of the world... Sure, you expected the good guys to win, but there was still a feeling that maybe - just maybe - something bad was going to happen.<br />That mood is really smashed to pieces in T3. It is easily one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen, from poorly executed plot twists to stupid one-liners.<br />The first two Terminator movies were dark and relatively serious, at times heavy-handed. This one is much breezier, despite the supposedly darker subject material. It's packed so full of camp and jokes that it could make your head spin.<br />For those of you worried about it, the T-X was handled relatively well; there are several dumb scenes involving her (Including one where she enlarges her breasts) but Mostow handled the idea of a female Terminator relatively well. She isn't exploited the way I would have thought, and the T-X is a rather modest creation. Somehow, though, she is much less menacing than the T-1000 was; I blame poor direction and Kristanna Loken (Who hasn't learned thatrobots aren't supposed to show emotion - come to think of it, Arnie must've forgot that, too).<br />All in all, the movie has some fun action scenes and there's some okay jokes, but it doesn't seem like a Terminator movie. It seems more like just an average action movie that - by coincidence - has Terminators in it.<br />VIOLENT CONTENT - There isn't a lot of gore, really. Most of the violence is in the form of explosions, punches, kicks, and of course, gunplay. There are a couple of somewhat graphic gunshot wounds. There is a scene where the T-X punches through a person's chest. There is a beheading scene, but since the person beheaded is a robot, it isn't gory.<br />LANGUAGE CONTENT - There's plenty of four-letter words to expect. I doubt that comes as a surprise to anybody.<br />SEXUAL / NUDITY CONTENT - Surprisingly, there is practically none of this. Neither Arnie nor Loken are fully exposed in the beginning; they are nude, but shrouded in darkness, so it isn't very revealing. And that's it... I hate to disappoint you hormone-driven teenage boys for whom the T-X was created, but she is not the jiggling giggly girl you were hoping for.
B0000042MY|4.0|(I still think they should've let Randy Edelman compose the whole movie!) Although I do admit Trevor Jones has some good melodies.  This is a very well composed soundtrack with some well writen native american themes.  Pick this one up quick!
0800128052|5.0|Who can go long without another dose of Rudy.  No matter what you aspire to be in life (short, slow football player???), the lessons learned in this video and true story can inspire you to keep on the path of obtaining your goals.<br />The story is great and keeps you rooting for Rudy.  The acting is superb.  The message and theme is fantastic.  One of the best movies ever made.
B000002MG1|3.0|The sales records for 1991's OUT OF TIME,has prompted REM to record and release AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE in 1992. This was not a big hit like OUT OF TIME but it brought the smash single MAN ON THE MOON,a tribute to the late Andy Kaufman. Again,REM cooled down with NEW ORLEANS INSTRUMENTAL NO. 1. The only other track that I know of that was a hit was NIGHTSWIMMING. Since this album wasn't a big hit,REM would wait until 1994 to release the follow-up,MONSTER.
B00006RCPM|5.0|Minority report is the best science fiction film. The story is never boring and surprises. The actors act  very well ! It's one of the best movie I ever seen !<BR>So I highly recommended it !
B00005J9M0|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys have an impressive catalogue of material to buy and listen to and in my opinion &quot;Introspective&quot; especially this version which is remastered and has an additional disc chock full of gems included is truly an amazing feat in sound. If you like new wave / dance music this is an essential recording for your collection at least I think so.
B000002BBY|5.0|This is an Oasis album which I would recommend to people who are hearing Oasis for the first time. This is the album which made people recognize them. The songs which really rock on this album are &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Don't look back in anger&quot;, &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;, &quot;Roll with it&quot; and &quot;Morning Glory&quot;. The other songs are pretty good too. &quot;Cast no shadow&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;She's electric&quot; are very good too.<BR>This album is definitely one of Oasis's best albums to date. If you want to check out Oasis, start with this album. If you don't like this album, then don't bother checking out any other Oasis album. If you do like this album, then check out the other albums and welcome to the Oasis fan-club! A bit of trivia for you: Oasis will never perform &quot;Wonderwall&quot; ever again in any of their live-concerts, so unfortunately for all of us, we can only hear it on tape and watch its video on TV. Anycase, all said and done, this album is definitely a worthy buy.
B000002LFU|4.0|This album is great,but GREEN is not an appropriate title due to the cover conception. This is REM's first album for Warner Bros. This album is kind of strange because track 4,STAND,has the letter R preceding the title in the track listings. The eleventh track is untitled,leaving us to guess the title. STAND would become the theme to Fox's minor hit series,&quot;Get A Life&quot;. Also &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic would use the music for his parody,SPAM. The album spawned a few other hits,POP SONG 89 and ORANGE CRUSH.
B00003CXI0|5.0|The story is exciting and there are  a lot of action and suspense. There are a few mistakes, but at all it's very good. The actors act very well, particularly Tom Felton and Rupert Grint.  <BR>I suggest it to all Potter's fans.
B000099T2L|2.0|Boring, dull, put me to sleep. Only bright spot is the duet with Luther Vandross, &quot;The Closer I Get To You.&quot;  Nothing really grabs the listener's attention, and definitely doesn't have the power to hold it. (ZZZzzzzzz!) Do yourself a favor and just by the single of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; because that is the best it gets on this cd.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora could have been GREAT; but alas! It was fated not to be! I mean come on, the album is just 37 minutes long. Does anybody feel tempted to spend 15 bucks on an album which is just 37 minutes long? But there is no denying that the album is good. Some numbers like &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Lying to you&quot; are really great! The other songs are pretty good too but you are bound to get disappointed with the duration of the album. It's simply too short! &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was a much better album. <BR>It's almost as though they were in a rush to get things out. They could have stuck in there and composed some more songs on the album. That's the only ill-feeling I have about this album: it's too short! Were it bigger, it would have felt a lot more satisfying. Quality-wise, it rules. But quantity-wise, the lesser said, the better. This album should have been titled as &quot;Evanescent&quot; as that describes it better.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Black Eyed Peas new joint is all that!!  Has something for all tastes - from Hot and Steamy to Political - Must have for any serious funk lover
B00008DDXB|5.0|The story is exciting and there are a lot of action and suspense. But there are  a few mistakes. The actors act very well particularly Rupert Grint. Daniel Radcliffe act very badly I think.<br />The movie is better than the one.<br />I very enjoyed it!
B00004RHZU|4.0|This CD keeps me focused on my tasks at work.  I keep it on to keep an upbeat feeling in the air.
B000002JS8|4.0|Scott made Highway to Hell one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. However, not many other songs are great. None are bad, but it's definately Highway to Hell that makes this album what it is.<br />HIGHWAY TO HELL- If you've never heard this song... You are crazy. Although people say this song was written for the devil, it has the best beat and guitar solos.<BR>IF YOU WANT BLOOD- Crazy, insane even, but still a great song.<BR>NIGHT PROWLER- Slow and haunting, you'll find it to be one of the better tracks on this record.<br />Though this isn't the best AC/DC album out there, it is worth getting
B000021XS0|5.0|Stunning music. Literally will pull you away from reality if you're not familiar with Dream Theater. If you are familiar with DT, you have no reason not to own this album. The drummer, Mike Portnoy, pulls off incredible feats of percussion, changing between VERY complex beats seamlesly, and yes, that is all manual. Nobody here has machines playing their instruments, and if you don't believe me, get the DVD. The bass, John Myung, while under-heard in this album, is absolutly amazing, and plays as naturally as can be (on a six-string fretless bass, no less). Lead guitar, John Petrucci, plays dizzying progressions at great speed and with perfect precision. To round out the instruments, Jordan Rudess plays keyboard on this album, hitting the spot perfectly with creative and (like the others) thechnically flawless musicianship (check out track 9:&quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot; for a perfect example). On top of this, James Labrie belts out clear, dramatic vocals (though he gets carried away sometimes).  Overall, I feel safe in calling this one of the masterpieces of modern music. Need further proof? Read one of the literaly hundreds of other breatheless reviews for this album. You'll find few who don't like this album. I simply can't say enough.
B00005JM09|5.0|This movie blew me away. Best action sequences ever, great story line, incredible special effects and one hot Terminatrix. This is an absolute must-have flick! I have no complaints about this movie, zero! Great show.
B000002JS6|5.0|Each song is great on this cd. We know how the band did this for the late Bon Scott. Brian Johnson really did his job as the new vocalist in Back in Black. The Young brothers also did great(As they always do). Here are the best four songs on the album.<br />HELLS BELLS- haunting but great. Makes you really think.<BR>SHOOT TO THRILL- Great opening. Lyrics are a bit strange, but the lead guitar is unbelievably good.<BR>BACK IN BLACK- One of the most famous rock songs ever. Perfect beat, perfect lyrics, perfect guitar, all in all, a perfect song. This one goes in the history books.<BR>YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG- My God, these guys are crazy, but that's why they're great. This song is so wraunchy its not even funny.<br />There you have it, the four greatest songs on this album. Every AC/DC fan(or rock fan, for that matter) must have this cd.
1573300403|5.0|HIStory II is fantastic, from the beginning to the end.  The King of Pop, Rock and Soul brings us an exciting international flavor in his mixture of unique and upbeat songs and dances.  Earth Song shines brighter than the rest, with the truth about the earth and what we humans are doing to it.  Grab the tissues, preparing for your tears to flow.  Then go out and do something positive to help heal the world.
B000002JNN|5.0|&quot;The Razors Edge&quot; is definately my favorite AC/DC album. They finally got back on track after a few years of mediocre recordings. &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; was a huge hit and still is today. Not only is the this song great in every aspect, the title itself makes the song sound good. Here are the best hits on this cd.<br />THUNDERSTRUCK- I'm just gonna say it, BEST ROCK SONG WRITTEN IN THE HISTORY OF TIME.<BR>MONEYTALKS- Of course it's not as good as Thunderstruck, but is another great hit.<BR>THE RAZORS EDGE- Deserved more recognition, but what can you do? Still a great addition to this album.<br />Although &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; was released in 1990, I don't think America can ever forget this record. It slammed rock n roll back into the world. Buy this album, it is impossible to regret it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A totally fantastic album from start to finish.I have listened to this album over and over and i love it more and more.So pull up a comfy chair and a good bottle of red and treat yourself.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I've loved Green Day since I first heard &quot;Basketcase&quot; when I was only 10 years old.  They are definetly a great punk band with great songs and catchy tunes. Besides Dookie, Warning: is by far one of my favorite Green Day albums.  The songs on this album are amazing.  Among all of them my favorites are Warning, Waiting and Minority.  Billie Joe really knows how to write amazing songs with very good lyrics and he and the rest of his band has amazing talent.  Even though the sound is little bit different I still think this album is very Green Day.  Very up-beat sound and great guitar riffs. Once again, Green Day has not let me down and I expect many more great albums from them.
0060523794|4.0|In a simple, almost primitive language Gerstner describes how he orchestrated historic turnaround at IBM. The book combines history with tips and observation and paints a picture of IBM from outside and inside. Gerstner is a genius of simple, but powerful actions. His insights are valuable for every manager<BR>on all scales; his passion for excellence and winning is admirable.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is one of the best works ever to come out of Jim Henson's imagination and not to be missed by fans of his work.<br />Sarah (played by Jennifer Connelly), a young woman who longs for an imaginary fairy tale world free of her crybaby younger brother must solve the labyrinth to rescue him from the Goblin King (David Bowie).  The labyrinth of course is populated largely by the whacky puppet creations of Henson's imagination, from the detachable-head Fire Gang to ogre-like Ludo to the goblins themselves.<br />Bowie performs most of the soundtrack, pairing his glam-rock 80's music well with the lighthearted antics of the film.  Overall, Labyrinth is a movie easily enjoyed not just by children but by those young at heart of all ages.

0385504209|5.0|This book was entertaining, and I enjoyed for just that, the entertainment.  If I want a lesson in art history or religion I will read a book about that.  Too many people are critical of the details.  This is a novel, it's FICTION.  If you want fact then read an art history book.  IF you want a good book that will keep you turning the pages then read this one.
B00005JL9B|5.0|This movie is so funny.  I especially like the crazy guy and girl and also the scene where the girl stabs the perverted dude in a place.  HAHA me and my friends were jokin that this is a romantic comedy instead of an action.  i urge u to watch this movie ull have a great time.  this is a wonderful party movie haha
B00003CXA2|5.0|A: 5/5 Stars<br />  This movie was an excellent blend of tears, laughter, and music.  Tom Hanks gives an Academy-Award winning performance as Forrest Gump, a man with an I.Q. of 75.  Forrest makes up for his low I.Q. with a good spirit, a big heart, and a \\"moral compass that never wavers\\".<BR>  Forrest goes from football star to Vietnam war hero, international ping-pong champion to shrimp boat captain.  In the midst of all of this, we also see the change of American society over the three decades the movie covers.<BR>    This movie is very moving and inspiring. The story doesn't explore much into the lives of the other characters, but it's not supposed to.  The movie \\"Forrest Gump\\" is about Forrest Gump and what even a simple and mentally challenged man can accomplish. What if we unchallenged and blessed people tried?  What could we accomplish?  <BR>  Winner of six Academy Awards, this movie is definitely one of the best movies ever.  <br />J: 5/5 Stars<BR>  <BR>  <BR>     What a passionately magical movie. it is the kindof movie that you want to hug yourself while your watching it.and when your finished the overall essence and feeling is so profound that you know you will remember it for a long time.forrest gump was one of the best movies of 1994.<BR>    it is the story, or legend, of a man who manages inadvertenty, to land in every major event from the 50's through the 80's. He may not be the smartest of people( his IQ is 75 but he is honest and innocent. kind of a memory of the time when we were all ignorant but still pure. over those years he meets the president no less than three times, becomes a ping-pong champion, receives the medal of honor, and even \\" gets stocks in a new fruit company\\"(apple). And he walks out of it all as a kind, uncynical person.it is also ultimately about his relationship with his childhood girlfriend, and how all their experiences lead them to a conclusion both heart-rending and sweet.their experiences trough each decade might differ in many volumes but together they are a symbol and reminder of that time.<BR>     Tom hanks shows again that he is one of the greatest actors of our time and generation. He is able to evoke th essence of forrest gump and not over sentimentalize his being. As for the rest of the movie, each scene shines with the love and care of the people who created it. Forrest gump is a landmark for the years passed and to come and it will remain in the hearts of viewers forever.
B000088E6M|5.0|The songs on this CD put 50 on the top.

B00005JLRT|5.0|Finally a Star Trek film with a bit of ooomph!<BR>Ok its not the only good one, but Nemesis is a great one.  The space combat is great, the story has a couple predictable but interesting plot twists one sort of resembling ST 2 and 3.<BR>There are a few areas where the plot seems to not make sense, or that the characters make or dont make logical decisions or reactions, but if you can suspend your disbelief enough to over look them, the story will grab you and suck you in.
B000067CPX|5.0|One of their best CDs.  By The Way and The Zephyr Song are brilliant!  This CD got my respect back for RHCP.  Californication was really bad...
B000002U82|2.0|Sadly, The Pink Floyd everyone knows is not as adventurous and exciting as the one in 1967-1971. This is Pink Floyd's last decent album.(Actually, Obscured by Clouds is.) While some songs rank as their best, the rest are fodder for guitar solos.<br />I must say, however, that \\"Breathe\\" and \\"On The Run\\" start the album out nicely. Breathe has that early 70's feel to it, and On The Run sounds a tad like mid 90's Radiohead (A great band, by the way!)And \\"Money,\\" despite it being overplayed, is still quite a classic, despite the annoying sax solo.<br />However, the rest of the album is very (and I mean VERY) [weak]. \\"Time\\" has some \\"lost innocence\\" lyrics to it with a stereotypical epic guitar solo. And will someone shut up that female choir? There's one thing I CANNOT stand on this album:the choir. It's just...no. \\"Great Gig In The Sky,\\" not only having a horrible title that sounds like something from Toby Keith, has EVEN MORE of that annoying soul singing with giant keyboards. It's very tiresome. \\"Us And Them,\\" is very good with NO keyboard and sax solo. It would be good as a mood piece, NOT smooth jazz! \\"Any Coulor You Like,\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" almost destroy the duds, but then the stupid ender \\"Eclipse\\" comes in, with, yes, the dreaded choir! UGH! <br />I know i'm gonna get some negative feedback, but this is my opinion. DSOTM is not a fantastic record. For those of you who enjoy The Wall and WYWH and female choirs, go ahead. However, the old-school Floyd fans who loved everything from Piper To Meddle, stay away. End review.
B000007MVX|5.0|This album was initially reviled by many critics when it first appeared in 1973, though Tull fans loved it so much that it went to number one on the charts.  With time the music has been better explained, and music has evolved to the point where \\"A Passion Play\\" can be put into better perspective.  However, the music and the composition, confusing as it may initially appear, allows you to recognize that this was an attempt to create an epic and phenomenal work.  In some ways the work is unfinished, because the original studio sessions were cut short before the original concept was completed, and thus three albums sides of material had to be cut back to two.  Some of the music originally intended for this album appeared on later albums; one example is \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day.\\"<br />The album was intended to tell the story of a recently-deceased man seeing his own funeral, and his journey in the afterlife, including purgatory and hell, and eventual reincarnation.  In addition to this primary story was the inclusion of \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,\\" a story likened to stories from Winnie the Pooh to Peter and the Wolf.<br />\\"A Passion Play\\" combines ten tracks into a single work (according to the official Jethro Tull web site).  As in \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" there is an occasional uneven spot in the transition from one track to the next.  However, as in the former album, the transitions and concept works nearly as well.  The music is certainly well refined, with hard-driving rock riffs, drums and synthesizers keeping Jethro Tull at the more experimental, progressive edge of rock.  I warn you, though, that the music requires a good sound system to be able to listen to music that extends from very quiet to very loud.  I compare this music to classical music, which similarly has sounds that extend from soft to loud, and also requires a good sound system.  I also warn you to attempt to understand the lyrics at your own peril.  The lyrics verge on the incomprehensible, even for those who have studied them at length.  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic, and attempt to describe events and concepts barely attainable by the human mind, much less by a human language.<br />Music such as this does not attempt to pander to a \\"style\\" or to commercial success.  This music is art.  Thus, its meaning, significance and relevance are to be interpreted by each listener.  I will not pretend to tell you that I understand this work in its entirety.  Perhaps it was never meant to be understood, in the manner of Yes' \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\"  However, while I may not be able to define or understand progressive rock, I know it when I hear it, and this music is definitely progressive rock.  Listen to this music only if you are prepared to be open-minded and to accept it for what it attempted to do, and not for the misguided interpretations of those who think they have been given the divine ability to judge the work of an artist as trash.rge on the incomprehensible, even for those who have studied them at length.

B0000508U6|4.0|I don't really think of this album as smashing as some other fans might say. Really, this is nice moody music for a rainy day. I used to talk walks out in the country listening to this. It's a really nice cd with some beatiful songs. Personally, my favorites are &quot;Sparks,&quot; &quot;Spies&quot; and &quot;Trouble.&quot; I plan to get Rush Of Blood To The Head. I've heard 6 of the 11 songs live.
0062502182|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone who wishes to pursue their dreams till the very end. It explains as a simple fable, a great moral. Never give up on your dreams, no matter what problems you may face. What i liked very much was the excellent analogies the author derives from the fable to everyday life!
B000002UR7|1.0|UGH, this is bad for any band. Why on Earth would you want to play post-grunge a few years after it died? &quot;Creep&quot; is just awful. One of the worst songs ever recorded. Radiohead said themself that they hated it. DOn't even bother downloading songs from this, people. It just..It's really bad, OK? Get The Bends for a good start.
B00008X5J1|3.0|This DVD is interesting from a historical point of view, and the scenery and costumes were fabulous.  As all non-native Americans came from immigrant families at one point in time, it was informative and even heart-wrenching to see what life was like for the immigrants in this movie.  However, there is too much senseless violence-even beyond the point of recognizing that daily violence for survival was a way of life in many large cities at that time.
B000002U9W|5.0|With this being the Floyd's first No.1, it's easy to see why. People had good taste back in 1970. This is Pink Floyd's best album, period. 5 songs of sheer brillance. Let's start with the Atom Mother Suite. This song is just brilliant from start to finish. Part western classical, part avant-garde, part blues, and mostly psychadelic, rolled into one big 23 minute suite. Incredible playing by everyone. If is a very dark song with some of the prettiest singing by Waters. I like the overdubbed electric guitar in the background. Summer 68, despite the corny intro, is a very nice beatiful song about a girlfriend and a man hating her, but also loving her too. Fat Old Sun, even though this formula was getting old in the 80's albums (which sucked), it was still good with this song. There's a nice long guitar solos for all you guitar geeks. Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast is another long song, this one being more humorous and less self-indulgent. I love the 2nd part, Rise and Shine. I'd love to have Corn Flakes to it. (God, I am such a nerd!) All in All, (no stupid Pink Floyd joke here, please!) the best Floyd album, period.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I watched this the other night, and I was impressed, partly.  It wasn't an astounding movie, one that I believed deserved any oscars, but it was good.  One thing I couldn't get over was how fake-looking the opening fight scene was.  And if something looks fake in the beginning, it's hard to get a feel for it.  The acting was OK.  Daniel Day-Lewis was ok, but Leo and Cameron were much better.  You could actually feel their roles---a little.  All around, it's good to watch for historical value, and I now know why Roman Polanski won the oscar.
B00009MGR6|5.0|Once more, AC/DC makes another fine album. Great tunes here,<BR>in tradition of preceeding AC/DC albums.<BR>With &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; you get a good example of how AC/DC kept it all real. They didn't go with what was current, they didn't buy into the hype of fashion and publicity.<BR>They just had a will to rock, and the will, and geuis to do so.<BR>Although not as good as other 80's albums, (Black...For Those...Switch...) it is better than &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; (although that's a pretty good album.) Out of all 10 songs, the best would be &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, &quot;That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll&quot;, <BR>&quot;Some Sin For Nuthin'&quot;, &quot;Ruff Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Meanstreak&quot;.<BR>&quot;Meanstreak&quot; has an undeniable funk, and you can't help but get something either bobbing or tapping in time to it's beat.<BR>&quot;Some Sin...&quot; is a slower, burning number, with a good hook, and classic rock feel, plus a dash of R&amp;B.<BR>&quot;Heatseeker&quot;, one of the live show staples, just plain rocks out.<BR>With the twelve-bar blues structure, and good...everything.<BR>&quot;That's The Way...&quot; is yet again, a fast paced rocker, with kick and bite to it, paying tribute to the good old days of rock.<BR>(An add for Chevy cars used a clip of this song which mentions a Chevy in a magazine, once.)<BR>&quot;Ruff Stuff&quot; is a pure, all-out hook-fest.(as described in the booklet). With a good melodic tint to it, and an equally melodic hooky riff, this song is one of their best, and has a somewhat &quot;different&quot; sound for AC/DC.<BR>And the others are good, too. If you can only buy two albums from the new set of re-masters, get this, and my personal favorite, &quot;Flick Of The Switch&quot;. You'll go home happy, and have these songs stuck in your head for quite a while (but that's a good thing, isn't it...)
B00005JLSE|5.0|After watching Moulin Rouge, I was a bit hesitant about Chicago.  But from the first time I saw the preview until I watched the movie, I was obsessed.  With better acting, singing and directing (I hated the eratic direction of the Moulin Rouge director), it's understandable why this movie won 6 Oscars and Moulin Rouge a couple.  This is THE best picture in years.  Watch it, or you'll regret it.
B000060P79|1.0|Many analogies fly, comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians.  Bands like this, although obviously imitating better bands like Green Day, shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence let alone \\"compared\\".  Every time the music making department at Atlantic releases something like this, they may sell oodles of records, but they kill music a little more.  I agree with that other guy.  Go buy Nevermind. Music is an art, not a product. But that's just my opinion.
B000002MG1|5.0|After they finished recording &quot;Out of Time&quot;, R.E.M. announced that they would do almost no touring for the album because they felt they were &quot;at a creative peak&quot; and wanted to get back into the studio right away and write and record two albums.  The three albums -- &quot;Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; -- represent the output of this creative peak and while &quot;Out of Time&quot; remains the most popular, I would suggest that &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; is the best of three.  <br />The album opens up with the ominous &quot;Drive&quot;: electric guitars make their first and almost last appearance, as do vocal effects.  Once this rain shower of a song passes, REM keeps almost entirely to acoustic and orchestral instruments.  The balance of &quot;Automatic&quot; has a lush organic sound punctuated and accented by lead singer Michael Stipe's soaring and sinking vocals.  The effect is the aural equilivant of walking through the grass barefoot on a sunny day.<br />The album goes through a lot of mood changes, from the upbeat &quot;Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight&quot; to ecclesiastical &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, but everything is united by John Paul Jones' excellent orchestrations, great session work, and virtuoso performances by Berry, Buck and Mills make this more than just a great REM album, it is a complete work that has more in common with a symphony than a pop album.
B00005JM09|5.0|I had to see this the day it came out, and it was a fast ride! The chases, the machines, weapons, and number of casualties, wrecked cars, and torn sidewalks is high! <BR>Arnold looks great, all pumped up and ready, Kristanna Loken is the perfect TX, cold and beautiful.<BR>This rides you up on a wave to the much anticipated Termiantor4...<BR>The special effects are mind blowing, and don't looks like CG at all, it nice to see that again.<BR>I love this movie!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This Radiohead cd, like all the others, took me more than a couple listens to really appreciate.  It starts out with the song 2+2=5, which is sort of The Bends meet Amnesiac. <br />Man, I can honestly say I only skip one or two songs when I listen to this album-it's truly fantastic!<br />If you've read the other reviews, you know about Sit Down. Stand Up, I Will, There There, ect, sct.  BUT WHAT ABOUT A WOLF AT THE DOOR?  That song waited awhile before I discovered it, since it's the last song on the CD.  It's a weird but good mix of an innocent tune with deep words.  <BR>Hard to get sick of these songs-you notice new things every time you listen.  The songs have so many layers and I'm barely halfway through digging into them!<BR>This is great song and Thom sings it with so much emotion it almost brings tears to my eyes at the end.  I can't listen to that song enough times, or most of the songs on Hail to the Thief.<br />For those of you new to Radiohead, give this at least 4 or 5 listens before you push it away-anyone who appreciates good music will at least acknowlege that Radiohead has some raw talent and emotion.
B000099T2L|3.0|I will spare people of a long review with ratings and details of each song because I don't get paid as a reviewer! However, I do have this cd and do not regret buying it. I am giving it a 3 star rating because there is nothing groundbreaking on this album that will distinguish Beyonce from any other &quot;pop star&quot; out there today. Despite that, for a first-time solo effort this cd is not bad at all. I personally think Beyonce is at her best with the more mid-tempo songs. If you are a fan of Destiny's Child and like their albums this album would be a must purchase. And if you are person who is on the borderline of liking Destiny's Child or Beyonce don't hesitate at purchasing this cd at all, you won't be disappointed.
B00008PC2O|5.0|If you already own the Ultimate Edition DVD, I don't recommend cashing out the extra money for this version because it isn't really xtreme with the exception of the new telecine master and the kick... 5.1 sound. The features are bleak with the exception of the New audio commentary with James Cameron and a couple of DVD-Rom features. If you have the UE, rent this version and watch the new master because it is the best the movie has ever looked. If you don't own any copies of T2, I suggest you buy this version but don't expect alot of features because there are like 2-3 documentaries and DVD-ROM material that is about it! But if you really want to get in depth behind the scenes material find a copy of the Ultimate Edition if it is still available. The movie looks and sounds good on there but it isn't as good as on the Xtreme. If you have a widescreen TV and want to see how good the new master is, go out and check it out because there isn't a single scratch on the screen not even dust or anything other than the crystal clear video. The sound is pretty dynamic but you have to have a really good system to hear it. I had to turn mine up to 35 to get the real effect. Well anyway, see the new master!
078322737X|4.0|Before the vietnam war gave us a generation of leaders who hate and distrust America there was a different America.  Lucas captures the essence of that time.  More importantly its success gave George the money to make the greatest movie of all times, and I don't mean Apocalypse Now.
B000001E18|3.0|First have to say that lemon is one of the best tracks I've ever heard from U2 and it is a shame it was only released as a single in Japan and Australia. It is the highlight of this album I think.<br />The rest of the experimentalish tracks are either good or average I think but there's only ten unfortunatley. I often found, with songs such as Numb, that they soung good at first but then fade a bit on the third listening.<br />I would rate this and Pop 7/10 but choosing between 3 or 4 stars, would give them three. They are both good experiments but are not much in comparison with some of their best albums.
0790729628|4.0|I own both versions.  I originally saw this at a drivein as the second feature that we didn't intend to see at all, but it sucked us in before we had a chance to pack up and go.<br />The way that Ford did the narration worked for me and I was glad he got what he needed in the ending of the original.<br />This is still a dark semi-depressing movie and you have to watch it in darkness to fully apprciate the environment created.  The director cut removes some humanity from the film so I like it less than the original.  Perfect would be adding the extra stuff, keeping the narration and the original ending.
B000001EAQ|3.0|This album without a doubt has some great tracks.  However I find that some of those in the second half of the album are poor and thus this ain't a consistent album. Also, some of the better songs get boring quite quickly weakening the album a bit. Despite all this, it is a catchy and quite a clever experimental album and still has a place in my collection.
B00005ATZT|4.0|It all started with Sam sheperd, the accused murderer of his wife who was convicted and exonerated.  The book of the case was actually assigned reading in a course at Elmhurst College.  knowing the background i was an avid watcher of the TV show that was lossely based on the Sheperd case.<br />I love the moment when Kimball says &quot;I'm innocent&quot; and Tommie Lee Jones says, &quot;I don't care.&quot;
B00005V6OD|4.0|An excellent soundtract to an excellent movie. Haunting suspensful ad compelling. Very imaginative and avoids the repetition of some movie soundratcks. One of the greats i'd say If you love the moive and the book your gonna love the music. Helps to bring the imagery of the movie back. Worth buying
6304708491|3.0|Yes, I was there in the 6th row when this one opened in Wheaton.  The excitement was hugh.  Not really a very good movie except that gee its fun to see those moptops before they they became psychodelic druggies.  If john and Paul were not the best song writing team of the twentieth century, I don't know was.  The power of this movie was proven by how often it was imitated
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is perfect. Can't get enought of this CD! It is so beautiful and powerful. I am absolutly in love with it. This imagery of the music transports the listener to a different realm. Even if your not a LOTR fan I think you'll enjoy this one.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I was very surprised by this album. It is an excellent effort to bring rawk back to life.<BR>Great influences are so clear here. Although many here have pointed Led Zep, Santana and such, I have to disagree... the most clear influences here are those from 70's german krautrock. Can, Faust, Amon Duull and even Neu. The songs on this album are not at all mtv-friendly, which is a positive point. Cicatriz, with over 12 minutes, is a perfect example of their krautrock influences.<BR>The sound may seem a bit messy at a first hear, but there are so many layers of guitars and everything else here that it is impossible to fully comprehend the music with just 2 or 3 listenings.<BR>I have to give it a five stars. It isn't all that new, as many may think. Like Radiohead did, Mars Volta is just reviving what is worth reviving and what many doesn't even know exist. Krautrock, baby.
B0000524CY|5.0|I [wet] my pants when I saw this. Never ever ever have I ever seen a scarier flick. Forget that [not good shining and] silence of the lambs, for they all [were not good] compared to this. No question about it. This is the scariest flick ever made PERIOD!!!! If you said this wasn't scary you must have seen the wrong movie.
0066214122|1.0|Couldn't the whole &quot;problem&quot; have been solved if the people had worn HazMat body suits? <br />It seems totally improbable even to the layman that you would work with potentially dangerous organisms without protection!<br />Maybe the characters in the novel should have read Crichton's ANDROMEDA STRAIN for tips.
B00009V7T2|3.0|'De-Loused in the Comatorium' actually has a latin flavour to it's sound, eg, a more heavier Santana. The accompanying long 6 or 7 minute rock jams is nothing new. I hear alot of the same exact thing in 70's progressive rock bands like Hawkwind, etc, with the same type of Pink Floyd spacey/prog effects in the background. Since I wasn't a big fan of At The Drive In I only have Mars Volta's music to go on, so I really don't know what I'm missing. But what I haven't heard means that I'm starting from scratch, and this is basically a hybrid of old sounds come back again...a combination of a harder-edged Santana, Led Zeppelin, progressive-rock, with shorter intense bursts of drumming.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I was looking to buy the film, having seen it many times before, and was stunned by the release date, 1999.  Although the film's prescience is perhaps better attributed to Chuck Palahniuk, it is still remarkable for the insights it provides into the psychology of the terrorists we face today. While the obvious parallel is to antiglobalization hooligans, the film more acutely explains the attractiveness of the bankrupt nihilism of Al Queda and similar groups.  The rage that fuels Fight Club is a product not of disenfranchisement but of disaffection.  So too the brain trust of Al Queda are not the downtrodden but rather aimless thrill seekers unable to find their place in a modern world consumed with consumption.  Even the jarring schizophrenic split that seems almost gratuitous on first viewing of the film makes sense, seems true, given the real world fight club of Sept 11 wherein men ostensibly of the modern world, educated and capable of productive lives, resort to acts of suicidal mass murder. Despite its brilliant psychological insights, I must leave off one star for its failure to provide a more tangible resolution.  Or perhaps George Bush is right, and the only way to bridge the divide is by means of the barrel of a gun.
B00009ATKS|1.0|I'm a mogwai fan and was waiting for this album to really floor me... this album only put me to sleep.  Their style has gotten a bit schizophrenic recently, the problem is that they jump from one style and one mood to the other too quickly and in an un-natural way.  The second track also mimics Labradford too much.  A lot of these songs aren't that memorable either, most of the melodies just aren't that strong, un-comparable to some of their older gems (Summer, 2 Rights, Helicon 1 etc).  The songs just drag without ever really grabbing the listener.  I'd take the recent albums by Labradford, Sigur Ros and gybe! over this any day of the week...
B000002HFU|5.0|In a time when comercial rap is predominant, [50 cent, Nelly, Jay Z, etc...] is good to know that there still is some classic stuff around, enter ODB aka Russel Jones, whom might not be the most lirycally gifted MC around, but he sure is uneek, i dont know how many times i've found myself saying \\"ooh baby i like it raw\\"...., you should take a brake from that trash BET and MTV has on rotation and listen to the real deal here.  Be sure to check out the GZA/Genious too.  Awesome
0385509456|5.0|This short book is incredible and I give it my highest recommendation, especially to those who love Lemony Snicket books. This book isn't like Snicket books, but it reminds me of them.    The narrator is 15-year, 3-month, and 2-day old Christopher Boone, who is afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome and is very high functioning. Haddon captures perfectly the speech patterns of children with this disability and creates a believable and touching character.    Christopher and his father live together in a house in Swindon, a tiny town in England with no university. His mother died of a heart attack two years prior. Christopher is very independent, though he has a tendency to walk away in the middle of conversations when they confuse him, punch people who touch him,  and brandish his Swiss Army knife when strangers approach him.    The story opens with Christopher discovering his neighbor's murdered poodle, punching a cop, and deciding to solve the mystery.    What unfolds in just over 200 pages is worthy of major accolades. I'm wonderfully amazed at this great little story of Christopher learning that he is a man.

B000093BDX|4.0|First came &quot;Beatles - 1&quot;, then &quot;Elvis - 30 #1 Hits&quot;, and now (my personal favorite) &quot;The Very Best of the Beach Boys - Sounds of Summer&quot;.  A single CD with 30 great tracks from one of the greatest bands of all time.  <br />I agree with the reviewer below who mentioned that there are many mono tracks on here that don't need to be in mono.  There is a fine stereo remix of &quot;California Girls&quot; from 2002 and this song has never sounded better!  But, if you don't care about stereo vs. mono, you'll love this CD!<br />Besides the aforementioned details, this is a really nice CD.  There are some great liner notes and pics inside, and the CD looks like the old yellow/orange swirl that used to be on Capitol 45s.<br />Personally, I would have liked everything to be in stereo, but this CD is well worth it.  From the bouncy &quot;Surfin' U.S.A.&quot; to the lovely &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; to the group's last big one &quot;Kokomo&quot;, this is a CD that should be in everyone's collection!
0316666343|2.0|I was so excited to read this book because of all the media-hype surrounding it- it was the first book I've seen in a long time that actually got a commercial promo.  But once I started reading it, I had to force myself to get to the end.  In theory, this is a great premise for a story- something fresh and new- but I thought that Sebold could have executed this story so much better, with a little more character development and a better demise for the murderer, which I found very disappointing.  I think that there are many books worthy of publicity that never receive it- this was not one of them.
B000099T2L|3.0|When I first heard Crazy In Love, I was very much anticipating Ms. Knowles' first solo record.  However, I was somewhat disappointed with what I received.  Although, I still do believe that Beyonce is a very talented singer, songwriter, and producer, I think she works best with her fellow bandmates.<br />Crazy In Love is very good.<BR>Dangerously is Love 2 is an excellent ballad, (which I should note was on the Survivor CD) but I was hoping that it would have been more remixed on this CD.  <br />I love Signs with Missy Elliot and also Me, Myself and I.<br />If you are a die hard Beyonce fan, then you should get this album.  However, I was disappointed and I recommend \\" The Writings On The Wall\\" instead of this album.
B000099T2L|5.0|This year I have bought many albums (justified, Ashanti Ch2 etc , but Beyonce's album tops every one of them . I just can not get enough of it. Each and every song has something about it which makes the album mind blowing to listen to. I have been a Destiny's child fan for a long time, but I was a bit apprehensive when the trio decided to do solo work, but after listening to all to three's work my worry went. Beyonce album is by far the best of the trio's work.<BR>Beyonce, currently has the No. 1 single, and the No.1 Album in both the USA and the UK, which is a very big achievement. <br />\\"We do not see Michelle Branch's \\"Hotel Paper at No.1\\" Which makes me think, is her album really better than Beyonce's, obviously not!!!!!\\"<br />Over all I rate Beyonces album 10/10 <br />Crazy in Love, You all know about this one, if not wake up and turn on your radio 10/10<br />Naughty Girl - The first time I herd this song I loved it something about the tune 10/10<br />Baby boy- Mind blowing song although I like the remix version better 10/10<br />Hip Hop Star- ok song but not all that 8/10<br />Be with you- This song is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo very good 9/10<br />Me, myself and I - Deep lyrics with a mid blowing beat, wot more would you want 10/10<br />Yes- Beyonce has out done her self. This song is the best that I have herd all year \\" yes even better the cry me a river\\" There is something about this song which will send a chill down your spine. Beyonce is defiantly in her element. It's like a good Mariah Carey song. 100/10<br />Signs- this song is also very good, Missy Elliot has done a good job. People if you like this song then get Missy Album under construction. Missy has done another duet with B, which is also hot. 10/10 for both<br />Speechless this were B reminds me of Mariah Carey, deep lyrics deep beat deep song 10/10<br />Thats How You Like It- fast song but once again the paring of B with Jay-z will give them yet another hit 10/10<br /> The Closer I Get To You Is such a wonderful track, both Beyonce and Luther Vandross have done a breathtaking job 10/10<br />Dangerously In Love - I loved the first version and I love this one Beyonce has done a superb job in changing it 10/10<br />Beyonce Interlude- Even this is good10/10<br />Gift From Virgo- When I bought this album before listen to it I thought that this song would not be very good, but after hearing it I was amazed. It slow song but don't let this put you of it still a very deep song. Listen to lyrics they are profound.10/10<br />BONUS: Daddy- I enjoyed this song, she has done a good job, I is grate reflection of how much she loves her dad
B00005JM09|5.0|People this is a PREQUEL NOT A SEQUEL it takes part 10 years after the events of the first Terminator that's why Arnold is back as the Terminator. Remember Terminator 2 when Miss. Connor dreams of the NUCLEAR BOMB destroying the world, now remember the T3 trailer that there is a NUCLEAR EXPLOSION, T3 explains what happens when the NUCLEAR BOMB IS SET. The kid John Connor in T3 most of you don't like it because he looks sissy well he is not in the whole movie another actor will play the older version of John Connor and he looks like a bad bum. So now that it makes sense QUIT saying is a sequel, and how is the Terminator back when he got destroy in T2? Now go and see the movie =)
B00005JM09|4.0|All I can say is \\"good job.\\"  I was amazed by how good the script actually turned out.  Excellent action sequences with an oddly huge sense of humor.  Some of my friends didnt like how light-hearted (heh, and I use that term cautiously) the film seems to be, as it never really has any dark, brooding moments of introspection like T2. Its just a really fun action romp that was done in such a way that keeps it from crossing over to the \\"cheesy\\" side. I'm a huge fan of the original films, and even though this is not James Cameron's Terminator, this is still one of the best films of the summer.  Hehe, definitely better than Hulk *gag*.
B000003RCY|5.0|Being a heavy metal to death metal listner I was a little leary of this album due to its \\"Industrial\\" label. Gotta say I loved it! This album is amazing. It reminds me a lot of \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" as a debut album. Raw and heavy, Dime bag Darryl could be ripping out the riffs on this one. Listen to Der Meister & Weisses Fleish and just try to keep from banging your head, I just wish I spoke German so I could tell what they are so angry about. For you metal heads out there your neck will hurt from the grinding riffs of the guitar and bass, and dare I admit it I even liked the keyboard. For you clubbers, its a little heavier then most techno but its repetative beats will keep you going. I can't recommend it enough!
0151008116|5.0|Despite its ecstatic reviews, I was leery of this novel given the aura of magic realism that was imparted by those same reviews, and by the whimsical cover that depicts a boy and a tiger in a rowboat built for three or four.  Clearly this was going to be a parable of some sort, in which the tiger learns to speak or some such nonsense.  Compounding matters was the fact that the boy is Indian, since the Subcontinent seems to have supplanted Latin America as a locus of enchantment for Westerners.  (And who can blame them?  What's more interesting, currency devaluations and narcotrafficers, or elephant-headed gods and corpse-devouring vultures?)<br />Spurred by the recommendation of a trusted friend, though, I took the plunge on this novel, and was absolutely blown away.  The most important thing to know is that the story is not fabulistic in any way; the only magic here is in Martel's story-telling, as he renders an extraordinarily plausible account of how a boy and a tiger *really could* co-exist on a lifeboat for six months.<br />Pi is no ordinary boy, of course, but the son of a zookeeper with an encyclopedic knowledge of animals and their behavior, which is one key to his survival.  The other is his religious faith; Martel manages to move effortlessly between detailed descriptions of the natural world and moving renditions of spiritual longing, often combining the two in striking ways.  In spite of its many disasters, even through the novel's stunning coda, Martel also manages to make the novel hilariously funny; it's not every shipwreck novel, involving the death of the narrator's entire family, that makes one laugh out loud every twenty pages or so.
B00009V7RF|5.0|For as long as I can remember I have loved hip-hop and for most of my life it was the only genre of music I listened to. Unfortunatly, for the last few years, hip-hop and rap has been in my opinion pretty awful, save for a few artists here and there. Elephunk is one of the top five best hip-hop album I've ever heard period. I just bought it today and instantly fell in love with it, unusual considering it normally takes me about a week before I really like any album. When I heard &quot;Where is the Love&quot; on the radio a month or so ago, I knew this album would be special. Will.i.am's production is what sets Elephunk apart from everything else. If you are like me, you are sick of just about all the producers out there. These beats were designed with music in mind and sound like they took a lot of time on each and every one.  The album doesn't stop at outstanding production though. The lyrical content is intellegent and delivered in a way that is both interesting and pleasing to the ear. The album features a wide range of lyrical topics including discrimination, love and the rockin' party tracks. Sometimes I think the goal of hip-hop these days is to try and master what someone else's work. BEP could care less what everyone else in rap is doing, that I think is the secret to their success. Most people will probably sleep on this album because record companies will probably continue to shove other rappers down their throats. But like a fine wine i suppose, only a select few can experience quality like Elephunk. This album has renewed my faith in hip-hop.
0783225881|5.0|Two of the most underrated (or underdiscussed) performances in 1980s cinema was James Earl Jones' and Burt Lancaster's bravura supporting roles in &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot;  The entire cast was wonderful (my only favorite Kevin Costner role), and Ray Liotta and Amy Madigan were especially terrific.  But Jones &amp; Lancaster showed a truth and honesty in their performances that were unequaled, except to each other.  Jones was so natural as to have actually BEEN Terrence Mann.  The idiosyncracies of his movements and his speech were infectious and completely believable.  Lancaster, as &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham, gave one his finest performances ever and, to me, BECAME one of the most lovable screen characters I've ever seen.<br />See this movie for James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster but, as some others have written here, also see it because it will not only warm your heart, it will inspire you.  This movie really isn't about baseball -- it's about what you dream for yourself in life, whatever it might be, and it will lift you spiritually in ways you cannot know.  I watch this film at least every 6 months to revive my creativity and spirituality.<br />And it's just a plain good old-fashioned cinema experience!
B00005RHGL|5.0|This is seriously one of the best movies ever made, as a kid I used to hate watching westerns with my dad but this movie totally changed all of that based on the actors in the movie. They all did a great job especially Val Kilmer who absolutely stole the movie! My dad and I actually made a trip to Tombstone, AZ and its represented well. A great movie!
0316666343|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've read in long time. The plot  and the writing are dull. The main character is a teenager but she sounds like an adult so I never believed in the plot line.  There are a lot of good books out there to read. Don't waste your precious time on this one!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|As a native of Russia, I thought t.A.T.u was going to be a band with no talent, who want to show the world that they are proud to be lesbian. But after my English friend gave me this cd in English, it has grown on me alot. So what if they don't write their own songs? Britney Spears doesn't, but that doesn't stop people from liking her. So judging them by not writing their own songs is narrow-minded.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is a true story about a Jewish pianist in Poland during World War II who manages to survive the horrors of the Nazis.  The Jews are forced from their home and into a cramped Ghetto where there is starvation, few jobs, and horrors.  Nazis take delight in bullying the Jews.  Then, millions are Jews are forced into cramped wooden cars to go to concentration camps.<br />The pianist doesn't go to concentration camps, however.  He manages to stay behind, but his tortures don't end there.  He is forced to help the other Jews build the wall seperating the Jews from the Germans.  At night, the Jews take long marches, following the Nazis orders.  The Nazis may randomly take Jews from the march and shoot them in the head, killing them.  The pianish manages to escape this, but then he is on the run from Nazis.  Good friends help them, but then he is alone when the city is bombed.<br />I will not go on with the story (I left enough detail out anyway).  I will, say, however, that the story is brilliant.  The movie does an excellent job portraying the horrors, sadness, and torture the Jews had to face.  The actors do a wonderful job of making the movie seem extremely real; it is as if you are actually at the scene, back during World War II, and watching this happen.  I found each and every part of this movie horrifying, but at the same time, very moving and interesting.  This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I missed this film when it hit theaters earlier this year, so I've been looking forward to renting this. I finally saw it last night and I've got to say this is a HUGE disappointment. There were a few laugh out loud scenes...like the rendition of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; at the wedding, Will Ferrell being naked and then another scene when he almost drowns in a pool, but for the most part this movie was BORING. Like another reviewer said, L.Wilson does act the same way as he does in all of his movies. I really think he'd make a better dramatic actor. As for Will, I really expected Ferrell to make us laugh, but considering the &quot;serious&quot; personalities of the actors he had to work with, I think it affected his comedic ability. I say pass on this movie. You're not missing anything. Catch it if its on HBO or something...
B00005JM09|3.0|Anyone who saw the first movies and saw the trailer for T3 had to be thinking that this would be the same movie as T2, except with some hot babe replacing Robert Patrick. I entered the theater hoping against hope that it wasn't true, but since the theme of this movie is that some things are inevitable, perhaps it's appropriate that the owners of this franchise inevitably chose to cash in with this unoriginal sequel.<br />I'd cover the plot, but there are so many similarities and blatant knockoffs of the first two movies that it's almost glorious in its shamelessness. We get both Terminators beaming into the present in giant balls of energy, naked (for some reason the female Terminator can regenerate her leather jacket after explosions and collisions with walls and vehicles, yet when she teleports into the present she's naked, not that any of the male audience was complaining). We get the requisite scene where Arnie walks into a trashy bar naked, gets ogled by women, scans the crowd and finds someone with his same clothing dimensions wearing black leather. We get Arnie searching for dark sunglasses, because this robot with the funny German accent has a sense of humor. There's a scene where our hero is injured and the legless torso of a Terminator is crawling after him. And of course, we get numerous one-liners from Arnie, even more so than in the past, including one embarrassing moment when he holds someone off at arm's length and quips, \\"Talk to the hand.\\"<br />Nick Stahl as John Connor and Claire Danes as his female sidekick are passable but have nothing of the emotional angst or range of Linda Hamilton. They are props in a series of long and actually quite well executed chase scenes. Hollywood has gotten to the point where a technically well-executed action sequence for a big budget film is required. Whereas T2 was a visual miracle in its time, the morphing of this female Terminator is now just ho-hum. That's either a good or bad thing depending on what kind of movie fan you are.<br />The only truly surprising thing to me was the ending. The movie avoids a pat Hollywood ending, which is nice. The general theme of the ending, though, is one which was set forth in the first two movies: if you send robots into the past to change the future, those robots merely set in motion a chain of events that creates that future (i.e. Linda Hamilton's guardian in the first movie becomes John Connor's father, and the chip in Arnie's arm becomes the key to actually building Skynet). If you create a series of two huge blockbuster movies starring Arnie, some Hollywood studio will be unable to resist the urge to create a mediocre, unoriginal cash-in sequel, even if the director of the first two (James Cameron) refuses to participate. <br />As an ardent fan of Terminator and a visual admirer of T2, I was hoping they'd leave the series alone, but that was human emotion talking. Arnie, a Terminator, divorced from human emotion, saw the inevitable. \\"I'll be back,\\" he promised. He was right.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I doubt these guys are the saviors of rock and roll.  However, the Strokes have been a breath of fresh air amid the TRL Britney/50 Cent/Justin music.  Yes, it's all been done before...but if you are going to copy the style of a former band, why NOT sound like the Ramones, VU or the Clash?  It's fun, it's energetic, and it beats the hell out of 98% of the crap you hear on the radio.  So just enjoy it!  It's a good CD.
B00009EIQE|5.0|I counted the days for this CD to arrive and I was not disappointed. BG follows up with more acoustic work after \\"Done Got Old\\" on Sweat Tea. I just recently read and interview with Buddy and he said at his concerts if he plays too much acoustic people want more electic, if he plays too much electric people want more acoustic.  In my book, he can play whatever guitar he wants and it all sounds great.  BG gives you his all no matter what he plays and a history lesson in blues while he's at it. My advice...buy whatever BG CDs you can. There's always at least a couple of amazing songs on each one. And if you don't like it you may be introduced to the blues of Junior Kimbrough or Son House or who knows??? <BR>Blues Singer was worth the wait. I love Lucy Mae Blues, Louis McGhee, Sally Mae, Lonesome Home Blues...hell I love them all!!!!<BR>If you can't buy all of BG's CDs, a good starter course is Slippin' In, Sweat Tea, and at least one with Junior Wells CD(Alone and Acoustic is a great compliment to Blues Singer). I would also recommend Muddy Waters Folk Singer that Buddy played on when he was just a kid.<BR>And if BG is in your town, go see him live. You will not be disappointed! He's 66 years old and can still kick bum on his polka dot strat!!!!<br />What more can I say, but thanks Buddy Guy and keep 'em coming!!!!

B0000931OG|2.0|Blur was one of my favorite bands of the 90s.  I particularly liked their Britpop phase but also enjoyed Blur and 13.  (Leisure never really did it for me, though it had a couple of catchy songs on it).  This new album is far from Blur's best.  It's mushy, buzzy, and  dull.  I've listened to it twice now and none of the songs stick with me.  Some of them already positively annoy me.  If you are a real Blur fan, you will probably want to check it out yourself anyway, but if you are looking to start somewhere with this band, start elsewhere.
B00005JMC6|5.0|New Zealand has produced a movie of proportions that will stand the test of time. A tale that is close to the heart of the Maori people, but one that can easily get audiences all over the world hypnotized by its beauty. Director Niki Caro brings to the screen the story of Pai (played by young actress, Keisha Castle-Hughes -watch for the next Anna Paquin), a Maori girl that descends from a mythical lineage, and is determined to challenge some traditions that are deeply rooted by her tough grandpa, who is frustrated at the lack of a prophet to help his people out of their situation.<br />In the process of telling the story of Pai and her indomitable spirit, the movie presents some of the most beautiful underwater and coastal landscapes, accompanied by the incredible music of Lisa Gerrard (ex-Dead Can Dance, and singer behind the music of Michael Mann's \\"The Insider\\" and \\"Gladiator\\"). All in all, I haven't seen a movie that has touched me in so many different ways in a very long time. I think the best movie I could compared it with would be \\"Big Blue\\" by Luc Besson, but not even that one has the mythical and cultural strength this one has. Enjoy...
B00005JM09|4.0|It's pretty silly that so many people gave this film low ratings before it even came out on this site. I just saw the film today and I think it's actually good. The action is great fun and it's entertaining even if it's not the best Terminator movie. Everyone is complaining that James Cameron isn't back noir is Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong....well get over it. I'm serious, get over the fact that this is fresh new start to the franchise and maybe you'll enjoy it. Jonathan Mostow did a pretty good job I think of taking over. <br />            Terminator 3 isn't the best of the series but it still has what can be expected from a Terminator movie. It has an unstopable villain, a lot of car chases and explosions and of course....it has Arnold at least. If Arnold wasn't in it then I'd say the film shouldn't have been made without him but ....He's Back!. Wouldn't have been a Terminator movie without him. The fact that there's a female terminator is getting knocked a lot but I think Kristanna Loken is actually pretty good. She's about as menacing as Robert Patrick was in T-2 anyway. She kicks Arnold's [butt] a lot and he's tosses her around a lot too. Their fight in a bathroom is pretty fun as he smashes her in the head with Urinals and she throws him threw bathroom stalls. <br />            I think Nick Stahl (In the Bedroom) is very good as John Connor. He sorta reminds me a lot of Michael Biehn who played his dad in  the original. They sorta make John more like him than he's like Sarah Connor or even anything like the John Connor from T-2. Anyway he pulls off the part good, he gives us a different and more mature John Connor than the Edward Furlong one. I only had a problem with Claire Danes. I like her as an actress but she doesn't really belong in an action movie. It's silly when she coinvenently knows how to use a machine gun or knows how to fly a plane. So her character is basically the only weak one. <br />              Terminator 3 is nothing compared to T-2 originality rise and brain wise but it still packs a punch. Fans wanted another Terminator movie and they got one and it's a not a bad one either. The end is surprisingly gloomy but hopefully it's the set up for a 4th one. They need to just go ahead and have the war of men against machines in the 4th though as the plot is getting old. I mean 3 movies in a row you have someone sent from the future to protect the future of John Connor. Hopefully since the machines actually rised we'll get a different plot structure now that's not just recycled from the first one. Anyway obviously I want more so Jonathan Mostow didn't ruin the franchise....he left me wanting another Terminator movie! I just hope I don't have to wait too long.
B00004Y62T|5.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley offered many enticements--beautiful people, beautiful scenery and atmospher--and the fantasy of lives that are full-time leisure.  Into this dream world steps an intruder--a likeable con artist named Tom Ripley.  Matt Damon fills the role flawlessly.  He is charming, intelligent, deceitful, caring, conflicted, and ultimately . . . WOW what an ending!  <br />Ripley wins the trust of a shipping tycoon, whose son is living a playboy existence in Italy.  This father has a minor role, yet plays it so convincingly.  He is a paragon of hard work, high expectations, and disappointment in a son who realizes he is rich enough to play rather than work.  So, he hires Ripley to go to Italy and convince him to return.<br />Thus Ripley enters the world of the son Dickie, his beautiful girl friend, and many other rich, beautiful people.  As he entangles himself into their lives there is suspense, intrigue, and throughout we wonder where Ripley is heading and who will suffer how in the wake of his ambition.<br />The acting is crisp, subdued, yet poignant.  The plot flows, and yet offers surprises along the way.  The ending is pure poetry.<br />Bottom-line:  This multi-layered drama is worth seeing several times.  In a sense, it revisits King Solomon's ancient quest to discover what is truly meaningful in life.  Answers may not be forthcoming, but the Talented Mr. Ripley reminds us that the question is truly worth asking.  Five Stars for a truly great film.

B00005JM09|4.0|... I have a theory that if a movie has a bad trailer, then the movie will be great. Look at movies like Jurassic Park III, Lost in Space, Deep Impact, Dare Devil. All of these movies had awesome trailers and they were horrible. Terminator 3 thankfully holds up to my theory and delivers on every level a good action/sci-fi movie should. <br />...the story thinks up a very clever extentsion of the story explaining why the machines still exist. Even though Cameron passed off the project I feel he would be proud that his saga has been honorably continued.

It has a menacing villain \\"very well played by Robert Patrick\\", awesome special effects, great action and the best script of any of them. Also I think Linda Hamilton should have been nominated as she does her best work ever. She's tough while you can tell she's very scared of the future. It's a great performance, I really missed her in the 3rd one.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This movie is very scary. I was captivated by every single moment of this wonderfully scary film. The first time I watched it, I though my heart was going to stop from frieght. This is easily one of the scariest movies ever. Not as good as Halloween, but this is easily one of John's finest movies ever. This is back when he knew how to do scary movies. And scary is the perfect word to describe this movie. It's a psychological slasher/ghost story. More cinematic than Halloween, but not as scary as Halloween. Definately a must buy. You must watch this one by yourself in the dark to fully appreciate this. 5 stars isn't enough to rate this movie. It's just to good.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The Terminator despite being made off a low budget managed to be a very effective Sci-fi/thriller. Michael Biehn's character is sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from a robot called the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Sarah is his main target because her future son John Connor is going to be a great leader that starts a fight against the machines.<br />  The Terminator is original and well directed by James Cameron in his first outing directing. Although the sequels are good it's a shame they all pretty much have the same plot. I mean each one has one future being sent from the future to protect and one to destroy. The 4th needs different material for it to work. I think they just need the future war against machines in that one. I'm not sure how Arnold will fit in though as the Terminator is sent from the future looking human to blend in. In the part 4if it's the war against machine why would they need a Terminator that looks like Arnold ? Mean the machines have no reason to have skin on and look human in the future. I know I should have talked about this in my Terminator 3 review but didn't think of it then lol. I'm just not sure how they can bring him back and if there's no Arnold, then how's there a Terminator movie ?
0316666343|5.0|looking at all the wonderful reviews people shared on the lovely bones i thought i would give the book a try.  I was completely blown away.  It made me wonder if heaven is really like how the author perceives it to be.  I love books and this is one of very few books that brought tears to my eyes.  It is a heartfelt and wonderful book with beautiful strong writting.  I suggest it for young adults and adults. But it is very hard to put down so be ready if you're going to start reading it!
B00005JM09|5.0|Wow, what can I say? T3 is easily my favorite movie of the summer. It is full of non-stop action.  The movie picks up with John Connor(Nick Stahl) in his mid-twenties. He lives \\"off the grid\\" as he puts it. No phone, no address, nothing to allow him to be tracked my Skynet. The T-X(Kristanna Loken) is sent to destroy him and all his future lieutenants. Once again, a T-800(Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect John, who by chance meets up with an old aquaintance, Kate Brewster (Claire Daines). All the expected action follows. Throughout the movie we find out more about Judgement Day, Skynet, and, most importantly, the connection between the characters.  This is really all I can say without revealing too much, because if you like surprise endings, this one will blow you away! All in all, this is a DEFINITE must-see for all fans of the previous two Terminator movies, and certainly one of the best films of the summer!
0316666343|1.0|This was one of this worst books I have ever read. The facts and details that captivate you to further read a novel, are reveiled in the first several pages. The book was cathartic, if you've lost someone close in an unforeseeable circumstance, great, maybe you can relate, but for the average reader, not looking for self-help, give this one a miss.
0385504209|5.0|THE DA VINCI CODE IS AN INTELLIGENT BUT EASY TO FOLLOW STORY. THE BOOK IS SO LUSH WITH OBSCURE INFORMATION ON EVERYTHING FROM RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY TO ART HISTORY TO DERIVATIONS OF WORDS AS THEY ADAPTED FROM DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AS WELL AS HOW POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS WERE ATTACHED TO DIFFERENT WORDS.  THE PLOT IS STAND-ALONE INTERESTING, BUT THE HISTORICAL REFERENCES AND TIDBITS TAKES IT FROM INTERESTING TO PHENOMENAL.
0312983867|5.0|Like the seven before Hard Eight, this book is excellent.  I have been reading for years and NEVER found books I enjoy more than Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum.  The only bad thing is getting to the end and knowing you'll have to wait another year before the next one.  I was turned on to these books by and 80 year old grandmother.  She told me she would sit in bed at night and read and laugh out loud.  She said she had no idea what her apartment neighbors thought she was doing in her bedroom. Truly delightful!
0446310786|5.0|I read this knowing that it was commonly read among high schoolers for literature class.  What I did not expect was that this book would be one of the best written novels I would ever encounter.  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who might read this review.  It is simply a beautifully written and unforgettable story.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Sandra Bullock is very pretty and a wonderful actress, and Hugh Grant is equally impressive. Great laughing movie, but there are better out there, such as How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. The character Hugh Grant plays is sort of a playboy, but otherwise the content is great for members of the family 10 years and older. I recommend this movie for your collection! It's definately worth having.
0140186409|5.0|I used to be dubious of the fame that some books have achieved, and wondered if the popularity was often earned.  This is one of those famous books we all hear about.  I was delighted to find that, not only was the writing beautiful and profound, but the characters seemed life-like, and the story well developed.  When reading the story of the Joad's struggle, the only thing that you cannot feel is apathy.  I found myself enraged by the atrocities committed against these migrant people.<br />I honestly believe that 95% of everyone who reads this book will be impressed and, to some degree at least, transformed.  Out of my favorite books, this one is probably in my top five.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I loved the Bourne Identity. Great story, great actors, great action. Franka Potente sparkles in her role in this movie. Definately worth buying and watching over and over again!
0446677450|4.0|Come on now, if you thought the above sentence was true, and you got excited, nothing will help you. You are hopeless if you are looking for a quick way to make money, just go back to working as a telemarketer, and call it a life. If you are looking for some good solid principles for spending, and teaching your kids about money then it is good. I was already taight most of these theories by my father, so it wasn't as mind blowing as it could be for someone who has not.
0783226160|5.0|Animal House is the best movie of all time.  Period.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Not since Keanu Reeves thrilled audiences in Speed, has an actor been able to get under the skin of a character. I found myself overwhelmed with a sense of pride and awe watching Will Ferrell light up the screen in this heart wrenching turn as a man going through a break up, and having to come to terms with his own emotions. I learned a lot, and I feel that I have taken strength from this movie. I feel like getting up every day is a little easier, because if Frank can do it, so can I.
B00005JM09|5.0|This is the best action movie ever made.The actions in this movie are  superb and the graphics are brilliant.So the one who has'nt watch this movie they should watch it.
B00006IUL7|4.0|The whole point is he can't sleep. Is there no sleeping pills or Melatonin anywhere. I work at night, so I have trouble sleeping sometimes. But seriously get over it man. I was having such an issue with all of that garbage, I could really get into the movie. I would have preferred if they would have called it. \\"Guy is really tired, but he did get like 3 hours sleep\\" as oppossed to Insomnia. ALSO, make sure not to order a french or dutch film called Insomnia. It is the worst... They don't speak english, but there is a [breast] in the first scene.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first heard of Damien Rice on \\"Morning Becomes Ecletic\\" on our local NPR station in Santa Monica.  I was driving to work and heard Eskimo over the waves and immediately was intrigued.  I didn't remember who the artist was so I had to go through the Stations Real Audio files of the playlist till I found it and listened to it.  I have been waiting for the Domestic CD to come out and immediately bought it. I have not regret it and its the most beautiful music I listened to in a while.  <br />The layering of folk melody, classical interlude give it a warm feeling.  And even better-the songs are not depressing-passionate and Damien Rice doesn't let lyrics get in the way of the emotion or the crack of his voice. The way i feel about his music in this album I unfortunatley can seem to share with any of my friends and collegues that would lsiten so I will recomend it to complete strangers.<br />....Hey, stranger....
B00005JLEU|5.0|We saw this twice on the big screen, and still bought the dvd. The attention to details in the flowers amazed me.<br />This is a wonderful feel good movie.
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Boudrain has one of the most natural writing styles I have ever read. I expect that when he speaks it is almost exactly the same as the way he writes. I spent a lot of time in my teens working in various restaraunts and also spent some time in the Navy doing what is called &quot;mess cranking&quot; which is the Navy equivalent of the Army's &quot;KP&quot; and I can tell you that this book nails it right on the head. The people, pace and life style. If you want an entertaining read then pick up this book.
B000000OQF|5.0|this is by far the best hard rock album of all time.  it starts with the perfect line...\\"welcome to the jungle.\\"  its an awesome record with axl's singing at top form, and slash, izzy, and the rest just kicking total bum and taking names.  the hard living, hard playing, hard rocking bad-bums from hollywood were the real deal, and this record proves it.  it put the band on the same hard rock level as led zep, ac/dc, aerosmith and the stones.  it blows your mind, and it blew away every other album of that time, and almost any time.  i wish they'd get back together!!!
0066214122|1.0|The flaws in this novel are too numerous to mention but leave you wondering why you wasted your money.  <br />Crichton develops a story that draws on the subjects of nanotechnology, bioengineering, and family relationships.  In the end he completely fails to engage the reader in any one of these areas.  There are a few snippets of interesting facts regarding the science involved in these technologies.  However, as the novel wears on there is less and less effort placed on transitioning between the fact and the fiction.  The time spent describing the mundane details of the day to day life of a father was completely wasted.  Crichton can't be a husband or a father in the real sense because his anicdotes are so far off it is rediculous.<br />I got the distinct impression that Crichton got bored writing this novel about a third of the way into it.  He seemed to be heading in a very intigueing direction, then he slapped together the rest of the book using little imagination or effort.<br />I was looking for a great Crichton novel, and got far less.  I feel duped, because I bought into the marketing and the hype.  Stay away from this one if you want to maintain your passion for Crichton's greater works.
B00003CXSM|5.0|JLo's best movie of all times! :] Simply put, its one of my favorite movies!
B000099T3P|5.0|There was a point in my life when I never would have thought in a million light years from now, that the Critters series would be released on DVD.  Critters has to be one of my all time favorite horror/cult movies.  The score was great, I never had a feeling you get when watching a horror movie where you felt something for the characters and yes, even the little Critters(a.k.a Krites; alien name).  Have any of you seen those little bugs best known as rolie polies? That's what I think when I see these fury critters.  Mutated rolie polies from outer space.  That's a killer, right there.  Cute, harmless, rolie polies that got transformed into something out of this world, with fangs, fur, and claws, oh my! Some people might mistake them for a strange bunny rabbit or something of the sort, until it faces you face to face with rows and rows of jagged teeth ready to attack you! Now the Krites like to head for the neck and stomach mostly.  So, if you or I were to face one of these critters, then it would be best to wear a protection thing around your neck and probably would wanna wear a bullet proof vest or something to prevent them from eating your guts out.  Yes, I know that sounds horrible, but that's the critter's nature.  Eat, destroy, and eat some more.  Their teeth can cut as sharp as cutting through metal, now that's sharp! And they're messy, little critters.  So, if you want my advise: Stay away from the Krites as far as possible.  They come mostly in packs, rarely in singles.  So they are never really alone.  That way, when you are alone, they can gang up on ya, and rip the flesh from your bones, just as fast as a pirana fish would.  You might be asking yourself: Where do these critters come from? Well, as silly as they may seem, they come from outer space in a space ship.  Yes, that's right.  Outer space.  In a space ship.  How else would they travel? They're aliens.  Man-eating fur ball aliens from outer space.  How do you kill 'em you ask? With anything you got: Machine guns to knives to whatever! Just kill 'em before they kill you! Oh, I should mention that these Krites also shot posin darts from their backs and aim them at your neck and make you weak so that they will have a better chance of attacking you when unconscience.  So, my guess is, to watch out for these mean, green mothers from outer space and make sure that you have protection or you can say bye-bye you.  Now, enough of about the critters, and more about the DVD.  I'm worried that since the price is a little lower than most normal DVDs cost, that there might not be any special features access to them.  I'm one of those DVD freaks that like to explore the making-of featuretts and so forth.  So, I'm hoping that this DVD isn't much of a dissapointment.  But all in all, the Critters movies are still the greatest horror cults of the 80s, which makes them the number one on my horror movie list.  Long-live the Critters!: Machine guns to knives to whatever! Just kill 'em before they kill you!

0385504209|3.0|Give credit where it is due, this is a relatively absorbing mystery that will keep you turning pages.  In addition, there is an interesting &quot;revelation&quot; about early Christianity (new to me, at least), and I will never look at &quot;The Last Supper&quot; the same.<br />That being said, Brown's writing style is hit-you-over-the-head manipulative (reveal crucial incidents a tiny bit at a time, just to maintain suspense, etc.).  And the characters are extraordinarily dull-witted, perhaps the better for the story and plot but at a considerable sacrifice to plausibility.  (To avoid modest spoilers, stop reading now.)  Our hero, for example, doesn't seem to realize that the &quot;Divine Proportion&quot; is an irrational number.  Furthermore, anagrams and backward writing are pretty obvious on their face, yet hero &amp; heroine -- &quot;experts&quot; both -- are curiously oblivious.  Finally, the supposed cryptologist has to have the 'atbash cypher' explained to her.<br />If you are like me you won't regret reading this book, but you will be frustrated by all these lapses that keep it from living up to its hype as a truly intellectual mystery.

These piano and singer based songs are performed and written by her and you can tell as she sings them.

I hope others in Canada will get to know her as I know if this happen, this girl will have her own top chart rating!<br />I must get...you won't regret!
B00003CXI1|5.0|You have to have a heart of stone - or be a Dursley - to NOT like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.<br />I say this not from the perspective of a child, nor the parent of a child, nor even a voracious reader of the J.K. Rowling novels about the boy with glasses and that lightning-shaped star.  Indeed, I only have the first of the five books and that, dear readers, only because my former neighbor and computer troubleshooter gave it to me before he moved to South Carolina.  My taste in movies rarely goes into the realm of \\"family fare,\\" even though some of my favorite films (E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Star Wars series, among others)  are geared for young and old alike.<br />I must also admit that I only started reading Harry Potter when I had just about gone through most of my Tom Clancy novels, Star Wars tomes, and history books.  I was not sure if I would like it as much as I do, say, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ms. Rowling's tale is appealing not only to the young but to the young-at-heart.<br />The 2001 film version, adapted by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris (Gremlins) Columbus, is an above-average family film.  While warm and whimsical in places, Rowling's tale is not exactly all syrupy and bright, either.  For the story of Harry Potter, wizard in training, is also a story which deals with fate, losses, fear, courage, friendship, and the struggle between the forces of light and darkness.<br />Sorcerer's Stone follows the plot of its source novel faithfully (some have said \\"too faithfully\\"): an orphaned Harry Potter is left to be cared by his maternal aunt Petunia and her husband Vernon, the terrible Dursleys, after his parents' tragic demise at the hands of Lord Voldemort, a dark and deadly wizard.  For most of his 12 years, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs.  When strange things start happening on his cousin Dudley's birthday outing and owls start flooding the house on Privet Drive with letters from Hogwart's School of Wizardry, the Dursleys try to hide Harry in a remote shack out in the boonies.  But Harry's destiny is not to be denied, and he is whisked away by Hogwart's trusted groundskeeper Hagrid.<br />Kloves and Columbus recreate Rowling's novel almost perfectly, catching all the nuances and details just right.  Though this makes for a running time of 152 minutes, Sorcerer's Stone never drags or brings on snores...at least not for older kids and young-hearted adults.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grant and Emma Watson are excellent in their roles as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger; their camaraderie and pluck is convincing, and the supporting cast, which includes John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, is an exciting and talented ensemble.  Adding his usual musical magic to Harry's adventures is none other than composer/conductor John Williams, whose soaring themes and gentle underscores give extra excitement to the Quidditch match and dark menace to those dark passages within the walls of Hogwarts.<br />The  Special Widescreen Edition DVD consists of one disc that contains the film itself (with English and Spanish audio tracks, plus subtitles in both languages) and a few extra features, plus a second disc with DVD-ROM features, games, puzzles, interviews, and links to the Web.<br /><br />The sound and picture are excellent, and the movie itself seems destined to be a family classic along the lines of The Wizard of Oz and the great films of Walt Disney.ivet Drive with letters from Hogwart's School of Wizardry, the Dursleys try to hide Harry in a remote shack out in the boonies.

B00005JKN9|4.0|I loved this film. Historically accurate? Don't know, don't care. It's a well told story. I've read many of the reviews here and I crack up at people who refuse to give DiCaprio credit as an actor. He is a great talent, and I'm as jealous of his looks as everybody else, but I give credit where it's due. He did well. Was he miscast? I don't think so. Keanu Reeves playing Johnathan Harker and Winona Ryder playing Mina in \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", THAT'S miscasting! DiCaprio did his job well, though the real star of this is Daniel Day-Lewis. I mean, WOW. How intense and intimidating can one man be? He was something else!<br />A Martin Scorsese film called \\"Gangs of New York\\" and people here are bashing it because of the violence as if it wasn't supposed to be there. It cracks me up how dumb people are. To quote Turkish from the movie \\"Snatch\\"; \\"What do you expect a grease-down and a shiatsu?\\"<br />The only gripe I have is when DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz are about to do the nasty, it's time to switch to disc two! WTF? Talk about pouring cold water over a scene! But that's not Scorsese's fault. That's the people who made the DVD's doing. Was that some kind of mean joke?! And why is the movie on two discs anyway? Couldn't they put the movie on one and the extras on another? For that, they lose 1 star!<br />I was disappointed with the \\"rumble\\" at the end, if you can call two gangs meeting and then being blown apart by cannon-fire a rumble. Still, I can't say too many bad things about this. I thought it is definitely worth owning, and while opinions are various, you can listen to the people who disliked it over historical accurateness, the so-called miscasting of Leonardo DiCaprio or the violence that anyone going in should be aware of, or you could give it the benefit of the doubt, rent it I bet most of you won't be disappointed.
B000069HK2|5.0|If you only know of The Used by The Osbournes, you are one ignorant pup. The first time I have ever heard of them was when I saw their video for &quot;A Box of Sharp Objects&quot; and I fell in love with it. I immediately burned it on it's own cd and listened to it over and over. I wanted to hear more of their music and it was before their self-titled debut was released so I had to download a few songs, and it blew my mind. That is why I have dubbed them the greatest band you've never heard of, becuase they were way too talented to be this unheard of. Every song on their cd has lyrical and musical genius on it. I never thought I'd say this about a scream, but Bert McCracken's is beautiful, not to mention his proper singing voice that belts out his cultured lyrics. Quinn's Guitar riffs are deep and powerful with flawless bass and beats provided by Branden and Jeph. I went to the Warped Tour in Denver a couple of weeks ago ONLY to see The Used because I don't like punk music as much as straight rock. I sat around in the nearly 100 degree weather all day to see them play. I got in the front row and it was THE BEST concert Ive ever been to. That's right better than Tool, Incubus, RATM, Metallica, KoRn and Kid Rock. They sounded better and put on a better show than the most famous rock bands in the world. They are NOT a punk band, they have way too much natural ability to put them in that category. You only know of them because of Kelly Osbourne? Buy the album my friend, you will not be dissapointed.
0393057658|5.0|As a huge baseball fan, I found this to be a very informative book.  It gives great insight into how &amp; why players are bought, sold and traded.

B000092ZYX|4.0|...'cos I think Myxamotosis is by far and away the best track, and others who've commented seem to think its all a bit weird. So many layers, so many conflicting and complementary beats.<br />A juicy bit of work with something for everyone...except all those whiners who want them to do OK Computer all over again (which still wasn't their best album). Anyone who wants to re-live the past glories, buy Christopher O'Reilly's 'true love waits' which is a beautiful mix of the old stuff.<br />The band knew that another Kid A or Amnesiac effort would finally alientate their fan-base (I wasn't taken with either unless I'm listening to them with the other 3 albums on 'random'), so they compromised...and as compromises go, this is a good one.<br />Buy it if you've grown-up with them. If you're still stuck in your old groove and haven't matured, then go get yourselves the White Stripes and re-live your waining youth.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Where do I start? This cd is arguably on of the best (semi) instrumentals I have ever heard, each track is wonderfully arranged; harmonising the piano and violin flawlessly. Secret Garden have definitely created a masterpiece. Each track flows to the next like a changing season. I especially like listening to it in the car, when the traffic gets hectic I throw it on and feels the stress melt away. If you like music that creates an image in your mind's eye, then this is the cd for you.

B000002KIE|5.0|The very least one can say about the Sex Pistols is that Johnny Rotton has a powerful scream. He sings, if that is indeed the correct word, in a impossibly nasal, impeccably nasty, improbably tuneful snarl that works. Just from the first verse of \\"Holidays in the Sun\\", the first song on \\"Nevermind the Bullocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\\", you can see why this trashy, nihilistic, angry group was destined for a place in the annuls of pop culture. Just listen to snotty way Rotton spits out his words--\\"sunneh\\"; \\"belsunneh\\"; \\"historrrreyeh\\". It's plain to see that the Sex Pistols, actual talent aside, were re-creating rock to be the angry, vicious, violent, irrerverant force it is today.<BR>The album, with the exception of the comparitave ballad \\"Submission\\", could be considered a one-note album, but that note is the soul of punk, and damn if the Pistols don't know all the intricacies of that note, from the disgust of \\"Bodies\\" to the rage of \\"God Save the Queen\\" to the pure sillyness of \\"Pretty Vacant\\".<br />Who could have guessed that mindless nihilism could be such fun?
B00009TB5G|5.0|this movie was the ultimate!!!! absolutely fanastic! You should definately buy this movie, it is worth it. Don't waste your money on the matrix or any other dumb hollywood movie, use your money wisely, and it's very wise to use it for this movie! Peter Jackson did an excellent job bringing middle earth to life. The books are even better. buy the whole set. Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien. This movie has nothing bad in it, except war scenes, which isn't real bloody or anything. Please, listen to the interview, i'm serious, buy this movie!

On one hand, he wants to be a serious songwriter skilled in the school of, well, Morrissisms, sighing lines like &quot;Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head&quot; and &quot;I'm alone, I'm alone will I ever ever have no one ever?&quot;. On the other, he wants to make funny songs with titles like &quot;Frankly, Mr. Shankly&quot; and &quot;Some Girls are Bigger than Others&quot;. And so, he tries to fufill both, and succeeds.<br />The two best songs on the album are opposites on this spectrem. &quot;I Know it's Over&quot; is a moving song about the despiration of love, while in &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;, Morrissey imagines himself as Joan of Arc burning on the pyre with her walkman, declaring &quot;I've got no right to take my place with the human race&quot;. Couple all of this with Marr's great riffs, especially the baselines on &quot;I Know it's Over&quot; and &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; and you've got some of the darkest pop ever to cross the pond.
B000002H33|5.0|A truley excellent Album in just about every aspect. The lyrics are great, dabbling in subjects such as Death, Lunatics and Misshappenings leading to disaster, do not get cheesy one bit. The guitar, god what can i say? Kirk Hammet is a god. You dont get much better than Hammet when it comes to Soloing' and heavily crunched sonic riffs. Then the bass. The bass lifts up the guitar and drums on this album, and sure does sound like a buzzsaw. Great job Cliff. Sadly, this would be his final album, due to a tragic bus accident. Then the drums, amazingm Mr. Ulrich, simply amazing! In some songs, i cannot believe thoose are drums. Imagine the energy you have to give to be a drummer for songs that are usually well over 5 minuets, and spawn more than 7 more albums. Thank god for adrenaline. Then the vocals. This is Hetfield at his peak. He nails the notes perfectly, and his signature growl is prensent often here. Sadly this is the last album to feature Metallica's first and best bassist, Clifford Lee Burton. The best tracks on this CD, although all of them are simply amazing, are Batter, Master of Puppets and Sanitarium. An excellent disc, a MUST HAVE for ANYONE. This CD a lone takes any other band and steps on them. Let alone what Metallica themselves could do. Though this is considered their best, i consider it 2nd best, 2nd only too Ride the Lightening. The Best Album in the world.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is my favorite Album, which means alot since I am a devout Metallica fan. In my professional opinion (if you will, lol), this displays Metallica (in all aspects) at their peak. This is where no man could drum like Lars, No man can shred like Kirk, no man could growl like James and no one could play bass like Cliff. All of that still holds true, but this is the album the completley blew me away. Don't let the classical guitar intro to Fight Fire With Fire dupe you, the is a Metal CD that will melt your speakers, rub calluses into your ears and smash your eardrums. It all sounds painful, but it is worth it - because this album simply rules. The best Metallica CD ever (which means it is the best CD ever, since all of the Metallica albums are better than any other album recorded, yes that includes ReLoad folks). All of theese songs will make you want to jump up and down, throw things around and make you get into a brawl. Every song on this album are pure thrash classics, and none can be considered a filler track. They are all simply amazing. This album is the second in the Metallica legacy, after their first masterpiece, the kickin' Kill em' All. You can tell that James Voice and Cliff's bass matured alot, but since the Guitar and Drums on Kill em All were KILLER, i cant say they improved. Lots of hard, crunchy, speedy, improvised riff's on this album. Excellent album, great great. The lyrical content ultimatley explore the topics of death. Here is a track breakdown:<br />Fight Fire With Fire - Nuclear Warfare<BR>Ride the Lightening - Electricution<BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls - Death, A Funeral and the ring of the Funeral Bells<BR>Fade To Black - Suicide<BR>Trapped Under Ice - Freezing To Death/Drowning<BR>Escape - Claustrpohbia and Escaping a Death Trap<BR>Creeping Death - Hehe, GUESS<BR>Call of Ktulu - Intrumental<BR>All of the songs on this Album are simpkly strnadout, awesome shredders but the best tracks are:<BR>Trapped Under Ice<BR>Ride the Lightening<BR>Creeping Death<BR>YOU MUST GET THIS ALBUM. <BR>If you dont, you shall [...]!
0790734850|5.0|Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got.<br />The performances are universally excellent--and maybe the casting director has to take the credit, maybe not--so it's hard to pick a singular stand-out lead in the whole piece.  And Kevin Spacey is generally so good, we kind of take it for granted here.  Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce as virtual unknowns in a Hollywood picture convince you very early on that they belong in the film.<br />Shot on location in Hollywood, with all the appropriate setpieces, hairstyles, mannerisms, this is a film that (minus the profanity and nudity) could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim.<br />It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a perennial and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time.
1563898586|5.0|After the hype about Watchmen I decided to buy it. While it is a good story, I was not impressed. This book on the other hand is something completely different. This is an incredibly entertaining read and I can't wait for volume 2. The characters are all well-known and they way they are presented in the comic is masterful. <br />All your victorian favorites are here and it is chock-full with tounge-in-cheek refences to some of that eras best writers (like the &quot;scene&quot; where they are investigating the first murders which take place in a street between rue Richelieu and Rue St. Roch. They don't mention the name of the street, but you can see it in the art. And the manner of the murders is exactly like the one in that famous story. I loved it.)<br />Just the use of the famous characters is worth the price of the book alone. But on top of that the story is quite gripping and the pace perfectly executed.<br />This is one of the best comics I have read in a long time. I hope the series continues for some time to come.<br />Run and buy it now.
B000002MNL|5.0|The two-bass hit of \\"Your Arsenal\\"--produced by the late Mick Ronson--and \\"Vauxhall...\\"--produced by Steve Lillywhite--couldn't be more different sounding, but they're equally brilliant.<br />Lillywhite is famous for his lush, folk-sounding producing style (Pogues, Smiths, Kirsty MacColl), but the magic he's brought to this album will make you forsake Daniel Lanois for good.  \\"The Lazy Sunbathers\\", the soft-picking of \\"Hold Onto Your Friends\\", and Phil Spector-esque intro \\"Now My Heart Is Full\\" all blow you away not only with their delivery, but the fullness of the production.<br />A big part of this is the exchange of rythym sections between albums, but in this case, the perfect decision.  Quite possibly the best of the Morrissey solo albums, and as good as anything the Smiths ever released.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld is one of the best comedy series to have ever aired.  The timing of the punch lines, the visuals provided by the actors faces and gestures, and the hilarious story lines all combine to create a true classic of American television.  It seems that I am able to laugh at the same joke again and again when I watch re-runs.  I see the list of new DVD releases every week and wonder why some other series are being made available in season sets before Seinfeld.  This series would break all sales records if it were made available.
B00005JLYU|4.0|Just so you know where I'm coming from, let me explain that I loved the first Charlie's Angels and was really looking forward to the sequal. I was hoping for the same blend of silly fun, girl power, great stunts, and that we-don't-take-any-of-this-too-seriously tone of the first that gelled into high marks on the likeability scale, the only scale that counts for a fluff movie like this one. After all, it's unrealistic to hope for a great plot - this isn't the type of movie that depends on plot. <br />Anyway, the first film gelled and is one I can watch over and over for fun and simple pleasure. For many reasons, the sequal is not a movie I expect to own once it comes out on DVD. <br />The Angels are as great as ever, the action sequences, as promised, are overblown, intense, and highly implausible. The girls prove once again that nothing is beyond their power. They can hop on any machine and excel in any extreme sport. They look like an ad for Sobe drinks. <br />Unfortunately, the action scenes are too implausible to be believed and the wire work is much more obvious this time around. People defy gravity, walk through towering flames shirtless without getting burned, many times I found myself thinking \\"Oh yeah right!\\" instead of \\"Yeah, right on!\\"<br />Bruce Willis makes a cameo and gets to die on screen for perhaps the first time. Bernie Mac is a wonderful comic but he doesn't seem at ease in this film. He just seems out of place. He doesn't know what function he's supposed to perform for the agency! And when he's called into action he's a nervous wreck. Some people found it funny but I thought it was mean.  <br />As befits a sequel we get to see more of how the Angels are faring in their personal lives. Are their romances progressing? <BR>John Cleese makes an appearance as Lucy Liu's father (they show a family picture, only her mother is Asian). It's an obvious attempt to get some humor in the movie but is so tacked-on and unnecessary that it seems more an attemptto get in some cheaper screen filler. Matt Le Blanc reappears as the boyfriend, but isn't given much to do, and their relationship doesn't progress at all. <br />Cameron and her beau move in together, making Dylan feel insecure about the Angels breaking up sooner than expected. To reassure her, Jaclyn Smith makes a nice cameo appearence, looking great with her special brand of soft beauty and poise. <br />Where they really went wrong was with the casting of the bad guys. The Irish mob guy wanting to exact revenge on Dylan (who we find out, has a past that includes the Witness Protection Program) is just plain silly. He's trying to be Colin Farrel but he doesn't have the looks or charisma. When he struts around like a bad [...] you just want to roll your eyes. The actor who played T2000 in T2 is also on board, another rather unexpressionless automaton. The first rule of any thriller is we have to be afraid of the bad guys, we have to respect them as threats to our heroines. The creepy thin guy (professional weirdo Crispin Glover, always a pleasure) also returns but this time as a rather good guy. This is a fun choice but how it all turns out is extremely disappointing, another big mark dragging down the likeability scale. <br />Demi Moore looked way too thin, both physically and emotionally. Her eyes were dead empty (which made sense for the character I guess), it almost seemed like she was characteurizing her ex-hubby's acting style of complete non-reaction as the best response for everything. The only reason she's a threat to the Angels is because she's packing guns, something the first movie did without, a choice I much applauded it for. This movie goes back to using guns and it's just too bad that they did. <br />The opening sequence is so totally perfect, the best representation of why we love the Angels so much because it has the right blend of sillyness with Cameron Diaz playing a Swedish blond bimbo distracting a bunch of hardened soldiers by riding a mechanical bull. Her infectious grin and unique cackle makes this totally plausible. They escape by piloting a falling plane in mid-air, very much like the opening scene from the 007 film, \\"Goldeneye.\\" Unfortunately, after that the movie's tone becomes either all action or all bad comedy (McG really has to learn how to use different lenses, he tends to only use extreme close-ups as if to say \\"you should be laughing at Cleese now.\\"). <br />If nothing else, this movie could be a documentary for fads of the new milleneum. <br />In short, while there's great action, a wonderful attitude about girl power, the three stars don't seem as great somehow because the bad guys don't force them to be interesting, they've already been introduced and their personal lives aren't engaging or surprising, the dialogue attempts to be witty through the use of excessive puns, and there's too much angst on the part of Dylan for the girls to keep that happy-go-lucky attitude they had in the first film. You may enjoy it somewhat while you're watching it, but soon you'll be wondering why the use of wires is so obvious, and why the laughs they strive too hard for just don't come. Something's not quite right... <br />So I recommend you only pay matinee prices if you want to see the special effects and great pyrotechnics on the big screen, otherwise wait for it to appear on cable. I'm giving this 4 stars because the Angels are awesome but I really expected better.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've liked the prior White Stripes cds but this one out shines the rest by far. By listening to the other albums I would have never thought that Jack was that good of a guitar player. Even those who did not like the White Stripes old albums should check this out.
B000001FAW|5.0|This album is basically a reflection of the Bee Gees' songs from Saturday Night Fever in my opinion.  They aren't all the same (with the exception of \\"You Should Be Dancing\\") but they all have that same mood, which is one of the reasons why I enjoy this album a lot.  <br />The songs, \\"You Should Be Dancing\\", \\"Boogie Child\\", \\"Can't Keep a Good Man Down\\", and \\"Lovers\\" are all disco-like.  \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" provides you with a lot of endless beats and a blood-pumping atmosphere.  \\"Boogie Child\\" is a great song that really defines ultimate disco with its marvelous pitch to it.  \\"Lovers\\" was probably my least appreciate song in this album.  It has a dance-like sound to it but it doesn't add up to the real quality compared to the other songs.  It's hard to explain--may be the vocals, the mixes, etc..  I had fun listening to \\"Can't Keep a Good Man Down\\", which shows a lot more prowess put into it--it's definitely a moderately paced song but rapid enough to get a good dance out of.<br />Now this part of the album is mainly where the Bee Gees show absolutely well-thought out definition in songs like \\"Subway\\", an excellent song for a Friday night to listen to, since the song's about living in the streets of New York City--saxophones, almost a rendition of \\"More Than a Woman\\"--probably my most favorite in this album.  Barry's falsetto in \\"Subway\\" does a superb job in making the song stand out with subtlety.  \\"You Stepped Into My Life\\" has a more slow pace to it but doesn't slack off by adding nice touches to it.  I listen to it sometimes but not quite often because it doesn't that particular emotion about it.  \\"Love Me\\" and \\"The Way It Was\\" are fantastic ballads that are great to listen to....similar to a \\"How Deep is Your Love\\" atmosphere...thumbs up for those ballads.  Robin's vocals in \\"Love Me\\" make the song much more appreciable with more sincerity.  Barry's voice in \\"The Way It Was\\" has me listening to the song 10x better.  \\"Children of The World\\" is fine I guess,although it doesn't have a real disco beat to it nor a ballad sound to it...just a casual song, not bad.  I think it's cool though, a good way to sum up the album.<br />I must say that this is a another compilation of the Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever songs because the Bee Gees exactly produce the same disco beat dance songs and the heart-renching ballads just like in Saturday Night Fever.  Any Bee Gees fan will be captivated by what the Bee Gees has for show in this album, where you could listen to it and become captured by its dexterity and skill.
B0000542D2|5.0|This is the best beatles movie, and its also the best DVD of a beatles movie. Picture quality is great, espesially for an old movie. The sound is pretty good too. This is a must have for any beatles fan.
038572179X|4.0|I enjoyed Atonement.  I didn't know what to expect when I purchased it, but what I got was worth my money.  The basic premise is that of a hundred made-for-tv movies: Jealous younger sister makes false criminal accusations against older sister's lover.  What makes Atonement a \\"save\\" is that it follows all of the different parties involved instead of sticking on one lead character.  We learn what happens to a man who's been falsely accused of rape, and of a girl who grows up holding her terrible secret close to her heart.  I ran through this book in 2 days while out on the deck but you have to get into it so don't give up--it has a slow start that will reward you with a fairly rich story if you'll stick with it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I never was a Soundgarden fan.. though I admit to owning 3 out of 4 of Rage Against the Machine's CD's. Rage was an interesting band to listen to, and Tim, the bassist, was my hero and idol. With a rock rap band, you're going to hear a lot of bass sounds, and hats off to Morello... he's just fantastic, so it was always fun to listen to Rage, despite Zack De la Rocha's utterly annyoing political agenda. <br />Audioslave is a completely different sort of sound from Rage, and from what I've heard of Soundgarden. I still get to hear the band that made Rage so cool to listen to, but I also get a better and more mature singer as the frontman. The entire album is definitely a buyer, make no mistake about it.<br />Cochise 4/5- In many cases, while this is the song that sold the CD for a lot of people, Cochise got old for me quickly. It's not bad, but I usually tend to skip over, for some reason.<br />Show Me How To Live 5/5- This was my favorite song right after I first listened to the album. It has the right melody and a hard rock feel to it.<br />Gasoline 5/5- Some might say it's a bit repetitive. I know this is MY reveiw but I admit I my be a bit biased, so there you go...<br />What You Are 5/5- It has the same sort of feel as the second and third song, but the second and third songs were good.<br />Like a Stone 5/5- Finally, the pace starts to change. This was a good choice for a second single, because you'll be hearing more of this later on.<br />Set it Off 4/5- Good song, but the intro bothers me A LOT. Other than that, there are no real problems here.<br />Shadow of the Sun 5/5- The pace starts to take a lungein speed, but at the same time, it allows Cornell's powerful voice to take over.<br />I am the Highway 5/5- This is arguably the best song on the CD. The lyrics are beutiful and the melody is sweet.<br />Exploder 4/5- Again, the band makes full use of Cornell's voice. However, this wasn't on par with the rest of the album, in my opinion.<br />Hypnotize 4/5- Thisseemed like a 70's song. I dunno, it just felt that way when I listened to it. It's pretty good, but again, not as good.<br />Bring Em' Back Alive 4/5- Good.<br />Light My Way 3/5- This song is just there. It doesn't stack up to the rest.<br />Getaway Car 5/5- This is a bluesy sort of song, and it's the CD's last amazing song.<br />The Last Remaining Light 4/5- It's good, but after five minuites of the pace they're at, it gets boring.<br />Overall, Audiodlave's debut album is a smash effort. Sure, I don't hear as much of my idol and hero Tim Commerford, but it's still an unbwelievable CD for anyone into rock music, wether you live in a world of Korn, or Pink Floyd, or even Avril Lavinge. It's called variety. This CD should appeal to anyone in the general genre.
B000084T18|1.0|Did someone hand Ma$e a gun? Geez,you know I suppose that is kinda cool that this guy has all this street cred,and maybe that's what gets some you real gangstas to buy this,fair enough,but what's this b.s. w/ this just being what everyone automaticly assumes they need to buy it now? If you're a G,cool,but if not,your a damn tool. For those of us on the other side of hip-hop taste,it's f'n b.s. that all anyone can say to back up this guy for his lack of any real skill is his history, I mean why don't we just start hauling out inmates and give them record deals? Even if gangsta rap is your thing,this c.d. is horrible,admit it.For gangsta, try Snoop,Dogg Pound,Ice Cube,Mack 10,or W.C.. There's better hip-hop out there,even way past gangsta, for those of you who don't see what the heck this hype is all about,because that's all it is,hype.
B0000009SM|5.0|I may be somewhat biased, as this was the first Zappa album I ever owned, but it has got to be my favorite.  The first track inca roads is out of this world, with a great guitar solo, Zappa using his unique finger tapping technique.  <br />One of the best best bands he ever assembled, with George Duke on keys, and Ruth Underwood doing percussion.  Much of this disc was actually recorded live, and if you compare the sound quality of the drums with other recordings of that era, they are actually quite good.
B000003TB6|3.0|These other reviews are crazy,dissin' Phrenology and saying this is the best album,B.S.!This is stilla good album,but every other one is waaaaay better.Cop Phrenology.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Interestingly, I was never really a Led Zep fan in the 70s. I know a lot of people who were, and heard a lot of their music, but I never even bought one of their albums.<br />But I have warm memories of the summer of 76, when The Song Remains the Same was released - with friends, I probably went to see it a half-dozen times. I recall it played in just one theater in Manhattan, and the sound was great... This gave me a great deal of respect for the band and the quality of their musicianship.<br />So when the DVD came out, I figured, \\"why not?\\". And I certainly did the right thing in buying this. The raw energy of the first show, from 1970, is astounding - Dazed and Confused is a great version, and the solo in Moby Dick is amazing. While the rest of the stuff on disc one is interesting, it is neither musically nor visually as appealing.<br />Disc two has some brilliant stuff as well - the acoustic set at Earl's Court is great, and the outtakes from the MSG shows are also excellent.<br />What I get from this set is a feeling of seeing a band that was rarely filmed at its finest, which harks back to just how great the best live bands were in that far-off decade.
B000067CQK|3.0|Wow. 3-stars for Ziggy Stardust? Let me emphasize something right from the start: 3-stars is not indicative of my feelings towards the music contained on this set. Ziggy is a classic album, and deserves that status. In fact, in deserves far more than is offered in this poorly planned, shoddy two-disc \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" offered from EMI.<br />Ziggy Stardust has been reissued countless times on CD in the past 15 years. In fact, let's take an inventory. There was the original, from-second-generation-tapes-but-unprocessed RCA disc that's currently having something of a critical renaissance. There was the original Rykodisc issue which came with bonus tracks. There was the anniversary Ryko box, with the same disc but a great box/booklet (far nicer than the one in this 30th Anniversary volume, and packaged much better to boot). Then there was the gold, Au20 series disc issued by Rykodisc (remastered again), and then in 1999 the Virgin reissue of the disc, which deleted the bonus tracks. And then this. While not publicized quite as much, it seems as if David might be competing with Hendrix or Elvis for \\"most endlessly reissued album\\" in this particular case.<br />So, uh, what do we have here, then? Well, we've got a two-disc set, held together by some *very* fragile packaging (the booklet seems almost designed to fall apart!). The main set is remastered again (although not very well...we'll get to that in a moment), and is supplemented by a second disc of bonus tracks.<br />Unfortunately, the iteration of \\"Ziggy\\" here is, I dare to say, the worst version on CD. The sound is slightly muddier than the already-overcompressed Virgin CD, but that isn't the main problem. What *is* a problem is the fact that the stereo channels of the album are reversed and intros to two songs (the acoustic segue between Ziggy and Suffragette City and the count-in to Hang On To Yourself) are missing. Missing. Inexcusable, and it's unfathomable that of all issues of the album, it's the \\"milestone\\" 30th anniversary set that's botched. <br />And the bonus tracks? Not only could they fit on the first disc--which, in current record company logic, would probably knock the price down a few notches--they've almost all been released before, mostly on the Ryko edition. There's nothing revelatory here, and although it's certainly nice to have these selections in print again, one must wonder why more effort wasn't expended in getting some nice, *really* never-been-heard-before vault tracks.<br />The verdict? If you absolutely, positively have never heard Ziggy before...well, don't buy this, as it's the only version on disc to actually make mistakes representing the original work. Track down the Ryko editions if you want bonus tracks, or grab the single-disc version (which really isn't all that bad) or--gasp--the RCA if you're so inclined. This set is for collectors, plain and simple.
B00005JM09|5.0|After watching Hulk a week or so ago where there maybe wasn't enough action, T3 was a welcome surprise - the explosions, brawls, and urgency of the film never stop!  There are at least half-a-dozen brutal beatings that Ahhnold or the TX take, with all sorts of mass destruction to the environment around them.  Telephone poles, street signs, buildings, bathrooms, cemetaries, hangers - no place is safe from rounds, bombs or flamethrowers!  <br />And to all this action a good amount of classic Ahhnold the Terminator one-liners - which are absolutely hilarious nearly every time - and this Terminator is absolutely the best yet.  <br />And when it's over, with its twist, you even want more, you want TERMINATOR 4!
B000006TRV|2.0|Roger Waters needs a life. Desperately! Yeah, this Wagnerian-style epic of how far you can crawl up your own backside was once a &quot;gosh-wow&quot; listen, I admit. Listening to it now reminds me of the downside of believing in your own purity and railing about how the callous world outside JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. It's an attractive myth when you're in your twenties--if it hasn't been relegated to a nostalgic look-backwards by the time you've hit your forties, get professional help before it's too late! Given an extra star for the great sound effects
B000002GVO|5.0|What exactly is this song about?  I think I get it but I just want a clear explanation.
0385504209|5.0|I am an avid book reader of all types of categories. I can absolutley tell you without a shadow of a doubt, this book was<br />one of the best ever written! Its a true page turner from page one on.<br />The moment Robert Langdon answers the door to the end of the book is one surprise after another. The history that is revealed in this book is utterly amazing! And well worth the time to look it up on the internet. Especially if your not familiar with Da Vinci, Priory of Sion, etc. The descriptions of the many places visited, made me believe and think i was actually there. This is truly a wonderful, well written book.<br />I love it! I am a Dan Brown fan now!
B00003CXUM|5.0|This amazing film by Wong Kar-Wai tells the tale of two neighbors living in Hong Kong in the '60's. As the story unfolds, the two come to the realization that their respective spouses are having an affair. The piece is so evocative of both mood and time, with gorgeous costumes, foggy streets, rendezvous in the rain and two achingly beautiful leads. Not too much plot to speak of, but with a mood so effective, who needs one?<br />Second viewing: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung turn in gorgeous performances (in every sense of the word) but Cheung particularly impressed me this time around. That could be because hers is the more outward performance, and Leung's is more internal. Both, however, were powerful.<br />The cinematography was outstanding. Not only is this a beautiful film, but each and every camera angle is chosen with utmost care and precision. Slow motion and digitization effects are used to great effect. The care taken with the visuals of this movie is incredible.<br />Those dresses... about 15 of them, some repeated more than once... exquisite.<br />And I want to get noodles in a thermos.
B00005JM09|3.0|The bottom line with Terminator 3 is action, and you certainly get plenty of it with this movie.  The action sequences and fight scenes go above and beyond anything seen in the first two Terminator movies, and are pretty much non-stop throughout.  However, take those action scenes out, and you are left with a very bad movie.  So I am fifty fifty on this one, I was entertained and it was worth seeing, but it comes nowhere near the overall appeal of T2.<br />What bothered me most about T3 was that it constantly attempts to play the audience for cheap laughs, mostly based on references to T1 and T2 and Arnold's now overly cliched one-liners.  What made T2 work so well was that it took itself seriously for the most part, but sprinkled in just the right amount of humor here and there to keep things light.  T3 on the other hand seriously borders on camp, and the corny jokes become tedious about half way through the movie.<br />As for the new TX, although we get many glimpses of the powers that make her the \\"ultimate killing machine\\", she is not much more intimidating than the T1000 was in the second movie.<br />What did satisfy me about T3 was the explanation given as to why this sequel was necessary, considering things seemed tied up pretty neatly at the end of T2.  Also, the movie manages to make its own significant contribution to the ongoing storyline of the war between man and machine.  In the end, we do see the story move forward, which is important considering that most of the surface plot of T3 is basically T2 rehashed.<br />Overall, the absence of Linda Hamilton on screen and James Cameron behind the camera is at times painfully obvious, but T3 still manages to be a visual thrill ride.  It is truly a summer blockbuster in the truest sense, action packed, fun, at times corny, but ulimately pretty enjoyable.
B0000A36J5|5.0|The Two Towers is without a doubt one of the best epic fantasy films of all times.  While it may not follow Tolkien's work as closely as many fans would have hoped, Two Towers still proves itself an amazing, exhilarating triumph in cinematic history. Many self dubbed 'Tolkien Purists' have had ill to say of Peter Jackson's second installment to the trilogy.  They complain that The Two Towers film strays to far from the book... They're missing the point.  Any of the movie scenes that were different from the book were different for a reason.  The novel is way too long to be crammed into 180 minutes of film in its entirety. - Changes were made to both make the movie flow better and to accommodate the mechanics of the third film.  So complaints over the book-to-film differences are null.  And as much as I am a Tolkien fan, I must admit that many of the scenes in the movie were done with more power and emotion than the scenes described in the book.  Tolkien, it seems, was too gentle or vague in particular points in his novel.  Peter Jackson has taken scenes that may have been a little dull or a little lacking in the novel and brought them to life with power and heart.  Changes like these make The Two Towers a better film.  This movie matches the excellence of the Fellowship and does well in setting the stage for Return of the King.  Also, this movie is worth owning for the character Gollum alone.  Gollum has been brought to life in the most brilliant display of computer generated imagery to date.  And Andy Serkis (voice of Gollum) does an absolutely outstanding job in portraying the loss, sorrow, and insanity of Gollum's character. - A performance that is definitely not to be missed.  All around this film is a five star effort.  Anything negative to be said about this amazing and unequaled movie isn't worth my time to mention nor your time to consider...
B00005JM09|4.0|While \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\", is not as likeable or entertaining as the original or the first sequel, at least in my opinion, it still delivers an intense, exciting ride and is a worthy addition to the franchise. It suceeds in holding the viewer's interest in both the areas of action and in plot throughout the entire running time and shows how judgement day finally comes to occur. In terms of acting, Kristanna Loken is decidely cold and stiff as the high-tech T-X machine sent to kill John Connor and his future human allies. Nick Stahl delivers a convincing performance of humanity's savior as does Claire Danes as another important future figure. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his signature role as mechanical and machine-like as ever. Despite a long overkill car chase sequence in the first half, the film's action sequences are incredible to behold, especially those concerning Schwarzenegger and Loken. On the whole, \\"T3\\" is interesting and exciting enough and sets the stage for the (yes) upcoming fourth installment. ***1/2.
B0000399WC|4.0|A movie that made a big impression on me in my early teens, \\"Papillon\\" holds up surprisingly well on DVD. The picture and sound  quality are more vivid than they ever were on VHS tape (although the vividness also has its drawbacks--a brief \\"storm at sea\\" scene during one of the escape sequences looks much more artificial than it did on the big screen 30 years ago), and the star turns of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman are as vivid as they first seemed. The movie's depiction of life and death in France's South American prison camps looks as harrowing and grim as it did  when the movie was in theatres. <br />Yet even as a teenager I had a couple of qualms about the movie--namely, that it didn't follow the book closely enough (and would have been better characterized if it did), and how did Hoffman's character magically regenerate a limb that developed gangrene and apparently had to be amputated? Over the years, despite my nostalgic soft spot for this flick, I've also come to wonder whether a younger actor would have been more appropriate for the role than the 40-ish McQueen (Henri Charriere, on whose memoirs the movie was based, described himself as a young-looking 25 when he was shipped off to the French prison camps), and whether a more gritty approach wouldn't have been more appropriate. The movie is pretty violent for a PG rating (it would probably be PG-13 today), but even with slashings, shootings, stabbings and an execution by guillotine (in close-up, no less), it's somewhat prettified by those grand, leisurely camera moves that were favored by director Franklin J. Schaffner.<br />On the other hand, I've also got something of a soft spot for those grand, leisurely camera moves, which now seem like relics of an age in which filmmakers didn't assume their audiences  suffered from attention-deficit disorder.<br />In passing, a TV documentary from a few years ago about the French penal colonies (it may have aired on the Discovery Channel or the History Channel) questioned whether Charriere's description of his years as a prisoner was factual. Apparently, none of the former prisoners or guards interviewed could remember a guy named Papillon who managed to escape from Devil's Island. So maybe any questions about the movie's accuracy are moot.
B000023VR6|5.0|this dre cd is great.many good tracks like the watcher,till the next episode and more a must get for the dre fans out there!
B00005JM09|5.0|Finally, a movie that was better than the trailers, the hype and Ah-nuld, whom I'm not wild about.  But they all pulled it off.  Best of the 3 Ts, in my opinion, as well as that of my macho T-loving companion.  The chase scene with the crane was amazing and the dark humor made me chuckle and outright laugh many times.  The female Terminator reminded me (in a good way) of Linda Fiorentino as the cold-cold-cold b*&ch Bridget in \\"The Last Seduction.\\"  The middle of the movie didn't drag and the ending was satisfying, if not spectacular.  Thumbs way up!

B000096H33|4.0|Well it is very hard to judge TB 2003. I must say after comparing TB from 1973 with a new version that i prefer Older one. Why? it was spontanic. It was romantic, Melancholic and full of heart. Mike was using only few guitars (for those who do not know it was Fender telecaster, Fender precision bass and one acoustic and classical guitar) and not so many instruments as you may though. Mandolins and some of other sounds were created using Electric guitar mixed and changed in studio to sound like, let's say, bagpipes. In 1973 mike was not a superstar and a well known genius player. He was just lucky guy with a huge talent who had an opportunity to record in a professional Studio his own ideas and melodies. It was all very spontanic...In seventies his music was full of passion and very personal (\\"ommadawn\\", \\"Hergest ridge\\"), while when he joined more mainstream style of music (\\"Moonlight shadow\\") he became a superstar with a lot of money, but with no really original concepts for his new records. yes i agree, \\"Five miles out\\" or \\"Islands\\" are a brilliant works too, but looking back to seventies it was nothing compared to emotional bombs that \\"Ommadawn\\" and other albums were. The music slowly was loosing it's soul. With \\"Amarok\\" he proved that he can still compose such a genius music like TB, but later he mostly made mechanic (in real sense - all of his new works were made with computers and synths) works and he lost many of his splendor and talet that he had before.<br />I am afraid about Mike's.future \\"guitars\\" and \\"millenium bell\\" were simply some wierd mistakes and they contained only a small shadow of some of his older works. Ok, even compare it to \\"songs of thr Distant earth\\" (his best from new period) and see how piontless he had gone. \\"tres lunas\\" was not his real studio album. It contained a music to a computer game - to computer game it was originaly composed, and in a computer game it sounds the best. those cyberspace stuff just don't work now.<br />TB 2003 isVery good album.Very good! But only if you forgot that he recorded the same thirty years ago.<BR>i felt satisfied when i heard the BASS along with main piano motive in first miute.in 1973 it sounded thiny and quiet, now it blows of your subwoofer. the sound is crystal clear and without any noises. But with those changes, the magic of original Tubular bells had vanished. In some parts you could heard Mike's fingers sliding on his guitar, now it is all so crystal-clear perfect, without any sound flaws.<BR>I heard that he is planing to Re-record \\"OMMADAWN\\" and \\"HErgest ridge. for music - 4 STARS<BR>for idea - 2 STARS<br />for all - 4 STARS...
B00005U1YO|4.0|While on my journey for good electronica that is similar to the prodigy, I have been recommended various Chemical Brothers cd's by many people. So I decided to pick up their latest album at the music store. While very good, it is not what I expected. If you've heard prodigy before, and you can't get enough of it, look elsewhere. You won't find energetic beats, fat basslines, or hip-hop-ish lyrics here. This is the type of music one would listen to while driving, chilling out, or reading. It tells a story and after the CD is over there is a sense of completeness. <br />So, in closing, this is not techno, or at least, not the techno I'm use to.
B000002MZ6|5.0|&quot;Songs of the distant earth&quot; are proving that Mike still can make timeless masterpieces, albums So beautiful and full of melancholy that you may even cry while listening it.<BR>I truly believe that this one is one of his best albums ever.<BR>Even if it sometimes sounds a bit like Vangelis, it still have it own sound and atmosphere.He is painting pictures with his guitar and Synths - it is perfext to turn on this Cd while you are tired of everyday's problems or you just want simply to relax. &quot;Songs...&quot; it is inspirating,melodical, simply brilliant...Turn it on and just fell it
B000002UKS|5.0|Words can not describe how awesome this CD is. I mean, Dave Grohl is the man, getting out from behind the drum kit to fronting your own band. How many people have been able to do that? Everlong is by far my fav song off the colour and the shape. This CD has helped me get through some tough times in my life when I was down in the dumps, and I just have to say Thanks Foo Fighters, thank you for a great album and keep up the good work.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Buy this album (and his first one)!  The music is original, up-beat and honest.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I missed this movie when it was released in the theater and only bought the DVD after seeing the last few moments of the movie when it aired on television in our area recently.<BR>At a running time of two and a half hours I thought it was perfect. There was never a point during the movie where I felt the need to look at my watch.<BR>One of the many things that made this movie so easy to watch was Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat. I had recently read some of the  critics reviews at the time this picture was originally released and one of the comments was that there was no chemistry. I would disagree strongly because some of the best moments of the movie are when they are on the screen together.<BR>The cinematography is another reason this was such a good movie. The scope of many of the scenes with the sweeping vistas, color and pagentry makes me wish that I had seen it in the theater because it really is something to see.<BR>But none of this would have worked as it did if it had not been for George Fenton's score to tie everything together.<BR>As for the extra's, once you've watched this movie, watch it again with director Andy Tennant's commentary. It's always interesting to hear about things from the director's point of view and the experience they had filming the movie.<BR>There is also director's commentary for the deleted and extended scenes. I would highly recommend using this option because Mr. Tennant explains why he made the decisions he did about these particular scenes. <br />The last thing I would recommend is to view this movie in widescreen format.
0140288503|1.0|This is one of few books that I have ever started, read half of, and did not bother to finish.  The 150 or so pages I read-- consisting entirely of stale, straightforward plot description -- were some of the most mind-numbing I have ever encountered.  <br />I was hoping for some insight into the Somalia conflict or the American Armed Forces or US foreign policy or even the psychology of warfare.  Instead, it's a kiddie book about a single mission and the story is alienated from any larger social, political or historical context.  I can see how military buffs -- especially those who already know the background on Somalia -- would be impressed by the intricacy and apparant authoritativeness of the narrative, but I found it empty and dull.

Secondary objective: complete analysis and assimilation of conceptual universe initiated by films \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\".  Report to AmazoNet mother network follows: <br />Primary objective attained with 100% efficiency.  Secondary objective attained with 75% (+/- 10%) efficiency.

630469797X|4.0|Dawn Of The Dead is the mother of all zombie movies,even italian directors that copy with imitators like(HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD,NIGHTMARE CITY,CITY OF THE DEAD)and so on can not come close to this masterpiece. To bad this movie is out of print on DVD,but I heard they are releasing in a box set with better sound and picture quality than this version. I can't wait!!
B000092ZYX|4.0|Actually, this is the marriage of \\"OK Computer\\"  and \\"Kid A\\", and the results are very satisfying. After the (for me) disappointing \\"Amnesiac\\", Radiohead finds a balance between \\"experimenting\\" and \\"rocking out\\". Case in point: \\"Sit  Down, Stand Up\\", which a few years ago might have lingered in (and ending in) the experimental but now finds Radiohead rocking out eventually.<br />The album is helped tremendously by a sense of cohesion, lacking severally in \\"Amnensiac\\". Tracks flow great from one into another. Stand-out tunes for me are \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" (the best track by far), \\"There There\\" (the 1st single), \\"Sail to the Moon\\" (an aching beautiful \\"ballad\\"), \\"Backdriffs\\" (great electronic, yet rocking tune). Keeping the CD from top rating are a couple of dreadful songs, foremost \\"We Suck Young Blood\\". Also, the album rambles on towards the end, and is too long (56 min.)<br />Radiohead remains one of the top bands around, and one of the reasons I get excited about new releases. I hope it won't take another 3 years before they release a new album.
6305428522|5.0|How many times have you seen this disclaimer at the end credits: \\"The story depicted in this motion picture is based on actual events. However, certain characters and incidents were added for dramatic effect.\\"<br />What the filmmakers are telling us here, folks, is that without these added elements, the movie would be downright boring. See, if we tell it like it is, we won't make money.<br />Director Robert Redford and screenplay writer Paul Attanasio would have none of that. They chose to chronicle the events leading up to the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s without the embellishments that have become so much a part of Hollywood tradition. For that alone, they deserve the highest praises. But what makes Quiz Show a cinematic marvel is its ability to keep the viewer involved while remaining unerringly faithful to the facts.<br />John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes turn in career performances as contestants who at first benefit from, but later become victims of a system that dictates that ratings are more important than moral integrity. Turturro plays Herb Stempel, the annoying Jew who at first makes for an appealing underdog but soon wears out his welcome, and so has to take a \\"dive.\\" Fiennes is Charles Van Doren, the handsome, clean-cut Ivy Leaguer who is seen as the worthy replacement and goes along with the deception, only to soon find himself in over his head but unable to just walk away.<br />Equally impressive is the supporting cast: Rob Morrow as Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin, Hank Azaria and David Paymer as the quiz show's manipulative producers, and Paul Scofield as Van Doren's ever-supportive but unaware father. Also exceptional, but easy to overlook in the glow of the all-star cast, are Johann Carlo as the unsophisticated, non-intellectual but nonetheless faithful Mrs. Stempel; Martin Scorsese as the less-than-honorable profit-motivated sponsor; and Mira Sorvino as Goodwin's devoted, if rather outspoken wife. All turn in tour-de-force performances so essential to bringing the brilliant screenplay to life. <br />The result: a morality play that is at once gripping and entertaining. A taut drama where tension runs thick in virtually every segment, intensifying as the movie progresses, and culminating in the unforgettable scene where Van Doren has to face the Congressional committee.<br />It is only fitting that a movie whose theme is integrity is approached with such uncompromising honesty, and for that we should all be thankful. For once, filmmakers actually stood by the belief that this was more important than making the proverbial quick buck.
B00005JKDR|4.0|How touching.  I love this movie.  It is great for kids but can be scary at times.  Children under 6 or kids that scare easily sahould not see this movie alone.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Just when I thought I saw the best action/sci-fi flick of all time (The Terminator), Terminator 2 came out and I was even more amazed. Both of these movies prove that James Cameron is very talented as well as creative. Now on with the review... T2 is just as good as the first Terminator if not a little better. T2 might not have been as dark as the first but that is a matter of opinion. The role of Arnold changing from killer to protector thrilled audiences greatly and it was neat seeing John Connor trying to teach the terminator to be more human. And just to top it off, we have a more advanced killing machine (T-1000) whose mission is to terminate John Connor. I really liked that the T-1000 could not only imitate people but also wore a police uniform and had a little bit of personality to make people think it was human. The special effects for the T-1000 were excellent and Robert Patrick was very believable as a deceitful killing machine. Linda Hamilton did just as good of a job playing Sarah Connor in T2 as she did in the first movie. I liked the more fearless character of Sarah in T2. Edward Furlong who played John Connor did a good job playing a 10 year old even though I think that Edward at the time was really 13 years old.(He certainly had the foul mouth of a 13 year old in this movie). Anyway, Terminator 2 definately ranks up with The Terminator and should be enjoyed by all action/sci-fi fans.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie leaves you feeling good about who you are- no matter what.  I watched this movie over and over.
0385504209|5.0|I usually bore easily when it comes to reading novels, but Dan Brown's &quot;DaVinci Code&quot; kept me intrigued from beginning to end. His attention to detail was amazing. I was in France a few years ago and found his descriptions of the Lourve Museum painstakingly accurate. Each plot twist made me want to finish the book even faster to see how it would end. I hope to see Brown write more novels involving the symbologist Robert Langdon. I just bought Brown's earlier novel &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;, hoping his earlier works are on par with &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;. It was an excellent book....Highly recommended
6303402348|5.0|This is such a good movie.  Tom Hanks is superb!  #1 gotta have movie!
B00005JLKB|5.0|And I mean big deal in the positive sense! I knew that when Smallville first came out on TV, it would either be a phenominal success, or a respunding flop. I'm certainly glad that it fell into the first catigory.<br />This series has become extremely successful, because of the fact that it has broken away from the traditional views of Superman that we have come to be familiar with, while still following along those very views.  This show begins with the familiar rocket that crashes on the outskirts of the Kent Farm, setting the background of some of the characters. Lana Lang watches her perents die in the meteor storm that follows behind the ship, Lex Luthor is in the field where the rocket crashes, and we find his hair burnt to a crisp. Then jumping ahead a few years, to \\"the present\\", we learn how Clark Kent, Lana Lang and Lex Luthor all form an uneasy friendship, and how Clark deals with the powers that are bestowed upon him, still uncertain of their source, even we are made to question the source of his powers. But we know one thing, Clark Kent is not Superboy or Superman, he is just an everyday young man with the curse of these powers thrown upon him...<br />Now, we can see these stories over and over again whenever we want. The First season is finally coming out on DVD, with the ability to switch from the widescreen to the traditional screen, and at a fairly reasonable price you just can't beat.
B000002NHN|5.0|... from the hard, often jagged edges of our trouble-laden world.  If I could momentarily go back into time, about 115 years ago, and dance in a field of sunflowers, in Oscar Wilde's arms (platonically, of course - I'm a woman) to the Celtic magic of \\"The Mummers Dance\\", my life would be complete.
B000069AUI|4.0|Excellent way to wind down a night of drinking! Calm and entrancing, this album is an excellent follow up to &quot;Parachutes.&quot; Highly recommended!
0385507755|5.0|James Frey's account of his recovery from alcohol and drug addiction is brilliantly written. He plunges the reader - all senses flaring - into the mind of an addict. The book is intelligent, readable, hard to put down. It belongs in every high school library, medical practice and recovery centre the world over. Thanks, James, for putting your experience in words.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Just let me start by saying that this is an impressive work. I can't understand why so many reviewers try to put this album down. Of course it's always a matter of point of view. Mine, being a DT fan for many years, is that this album completely fits into their musical evolution. I will give this one 5 stars. I always reserve 5 stars for perfect albums. <BR>By listening to the amazing performances on 6 Degrees Of Inner Turbulence I'm pretty sure Dream Theater's next work will deserve more than 5.
B00000BKE1|4.0|Maiden's ninenth and last album with Dickinson(till Brave New World)Fear of the Dark is miles away from No Prayer For the Dying, which was actually pretty cool album.<br />Be Quick or Be Dead- Great opener and their first single from this album. It' s the heaviest track on this album and also one of the better tracks. Bruce's raspy singing don't bother mein this one.5/5<br />From Here to Eternity-The second singlecut is also heavy one. I can't see why someone dislike this, 'cause it's again strong track.4.5/5<br />Afraid to Shoot Strangers- An epic about Gulf War.First soft, then hard, then totally berserking and soft again.Excellent song, but it' s little better when it's played live.5/5<br />Fear is the Key- Little disapointment after three stong tracks.Guitars are little creepy and lyrics are little repetive and funny, even though it tells about AIDS.Guitar solos aren' t amazing at all.But it ain't unlistenable, it's average. 3/5<br />Childhood's End- This is surprisingly excellent song.Everything is under control.It contains superb lyrics, even tough they sounds simple.5/5<br />Wasting Love- This one has got great music, but there's one thing that I don' t like so much, and that is the verse \\"dream on brothers...dream on sisters\\".But chorus is excellent.4/5<br />The Fugitive- Intro is so great, that you'll think that this great song.Well, it is.But the mood somehow lacks in the chorus.But it's strong song and one of the better songs on this album.4.5/5<br />Chains of Misery-Here it starts a little downhill. It' s not as bad as The Apparition or Fear is the Key, But it misses something, and I don't exactly know what.Guitar solos are the highlight on this song and chorus is good, altought it's little repetive.3.5/5<br />The Apparition- I think Harris will always shame this song. Lyrics are at least good and so is the middle part, but incredibly boring, surprisingly simple and amazingly stupid music ruins it all.Even deaf men suffers this song.One of Maiden's mostforgetable and the worst song.1/5<br />Judas be my Guide- after hard earaches(headaches and heartaches)comes the saviour of the last half, Judas be my Guide.It's short, energetic, good, better, best.Everything under control and lyrics are...I can't figure any word...5/5<br />Weekend Warrior- again a little drop, but this ain't so bad.Music is surprisingly great, but lyrics are little cheesy.3/5<br />Fear of the Dark- Hard to say anything bad.It's a legend, but I prefer live versions(best yet is on Rock in Rio).5/5<br />So why 4 stars?Well, without The apparition this could be better.Of course you can skip it so it doesn't hurt this album. And I think that on this record I can't hate Janick Gers, cause I regocnize him only on solos.But buy it, cause it has some classic songs.
B00006LLNV|5.0|Besides being an excellent soundtrack, this album is also a perfect introduction to the music of Mexico.  People generally associate the polka-influenced \\"nortena\\" and \\"ranchera por accordeon\\" with traditional Mexican music; although these styles are native to the country, they are neither the oldest nor the only examples of Mexico's rich musical heritage.  Indeed, guitars are the dominant instruments in the score for the movie Frida, with careful attention being paid to the Spanish-influenced melodies found in most styles of Mexican music.  \\"The Floating Bed\\" combines marimbas, various guitars, and piano to create a uniquely Mexican atmosphere.  I cannot think of a bad track; this album is excellent!  The soundtrack to Frida is a pleasurable listen all the way through, from the joyful \\"El Conejo\\" to the haunting and riveting tango \\"Alcoba Azul,\\" and many others as well.  Lila Downs makes a superb appearance with her haunting and powerful voice, particularly with the introductory \\"Benediction and Dream\\" and the duet with Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso, \\"Burn it Blue.\\"  Most of the melodies have a certain haunting quality which is common to Mexican music as well as latin music in general.  The song \\"Alcoba Azul\\" is a tango, a musical style and dance native to Argentina; however, the extensive use of guitars adds a distinctly Mexican flavor which enhances the mood quite well.  Actor Salma Hayek does a surprisingly remarkable job of singing on \\"La Bruja,\\" exposing a hidden talent that works in her favor.  The soundtrack to Frida proves that traditional Mexican music may be obscure, but it is definitely not dead.  It makes a great addition to any CD collection, particularly for those interested in Latin music.
B00007KQKM|5.0|It is rare that a novel can successfully be adapted to the screen without losing much of its force.  Lady Chatterley, Ken Russell's adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, however, loses almost none of the force of the original source.  The novel was banned when it came out, and one viewing of Lady Chatterley will explain why.<br />      The British VHS box for Lady Chatterley boasts that it is filled with \\"very, very erotic sex.\\"  That is about the most accurate statement you can make about this movie.  Lest one get the wrong idea, however, this made-for-TV movie is not pornography.  It utilizes the original plot, cutting out some of the more social aspects of the novel, to tell a beautiful story about one woman's search for love -- sexual and otherwise -- outside of her marriage and class.<br />     Joely Richardson, best known in the U.S. for cavorting with Mel Gibson in \\"The Patriot,\\" here bares it all early and often with Sean Bean.  Both of them shine in their respective roles.  Ms. Richardson is brilliant as a strong, independent woman whose husband is crippled during WWI, thus basically ending her sexual life prematurely.  Sean Bean plays her lowly, gamekeeper lover, Oliver Mellors.  The dirty, scruffy, growling Mellors is the perfect vehicle for Sean Bean's talent -- part bad guy, part sensual lover, in many ways a guilty pleasure (much like Sean Bean himself!)<br />     This is not a movie for immature audiences -- it is as beautiful a story as it is erotic, much the way D. H. Lawrence wrote it.  Nor is it for the faint of heart -- the sex scenes are revealing and very intense.  It is beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and overall, is an amazing cinematic experience.  The 3.5 hours are well worth watching, at least for fans of Joely Richardson or Sean Bean.<br />     Although the movie is extremely good, I would definitely recommend reading the original novel as well, particularly the unexpurgated version.  Some of the best scenes in the novel were cut for censorship considerations and their inability to work onscreen.  Nonetheless, fans of the novel will not be disappointed -- and those unacquainted with the novel will certainly be more than a little surprised at the force and eroticism of this movie.
B000062TU1|3.0|I still don't know if I like the movie or not.<br />Though, it's not really the movie in question, it's the book. Personally I dislike the first and (to a certain degree) the second books in the series. Some of the lines are a bit cheesy and I -despise- the ending (you broke all the rules, have a trophy!). Ok, yeah, he kinda saved the world, but still- shouldn't he get some kind of punishment for breaking at least a hundred rules at that school? It suffers from classic 'happy end' syndrome.<br />Now, the 3rd and 4th I really like, and I totally dig the 5th. Maybe that's because I'm a sick twisted little kid, but that's ok I guess. <3 for Moody.<br />Onto the actual movie...Hermione and Ron are great. Harry however isn't that great of an actor- he cracks maybe 3 facial expressions in the entire movie (*coughcoughkeanureevescoughcough*...i love the matrix though). Virtually the whole rest of the casting is perfect. <br />I'm really waiting for the rest of the books to be made into movies, as I believe they will hold up to the spirit of the books more. There is only one problem (Which I believe Abarat, if made into a movie, will suffer of as well). If the 5th/4th books are made into movies they will probably be too scary for the lower end of HP's target audience. I'm talking about the ending of Goblet and just about all of Pheonix. I just hope that they PLEASE don't try to dumb the books down.<br />In any case, I don't know if I like this movie as a movie or not. The effects are severely lacking (ergh, the troll looks SO fake). It sticks to the books well, I guess. I get that 'oh, jeez' stomach-turn effect at a few lines, though. <br />Verdict? It's a well made movie, for the most part. I'm just not a huge fan of the early books. I just wish Harry's casting could have been a -tad- better.
B000002H38|5.0|This album remains timeless. \\"Sweet Love\\", \\"Mystery\\", \\"You Bring Me Joy\\" and several other tracks featured here are truly immortal Soul ballads that define the essence of the Quiet Storm. Back in 1986, most wouldn't have believed how successful this album would be...but it was. Anita Baker is one of the best songstresses of her generation and this CD is indispensable for any fanof real R&B music. Thanks for such a strong commitment to real music, Anita!!!
B00005ABIP|2.0|It's often hard to tell each track from another, every track is unremarkable, and uniquely Cake. If you like Cake, get this cd, because it sounds like everything else they've done. If you don't like Cake, congratulations.

B00005YW4H|2.0|I bought this because I had only heard a snipet of &quot;Don't know why&quot; and was captivated by Jones' voice.  Unfortunately, once I listened to the CD, there was nothing holding me there.  The music is flat and has no lasting holding power.  I look forward to future Jones' albums, but this one is going in the bin.
B000099T2L|5.0|BETTER THAN ANY DESTINY CHILD ALBUM...I STARTED TO NOT LIKE DESTINY CHILD AFTER THE ORIGINAL BREAKUP. I THOUGHT THEY DID THE GIRLS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY IN THE GROUP WRONG. HOWEVER, BEYONCE HAS SHOWED HER WRITING ABILITIES IN THIS ALBUM AND I MUST GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT IS DUE. I CAN NO LONGER BE A HATER. I LOVE THE BEGINNING TO THE VERY END OF THIS ALBUM. I THOUGHT THE VIBE WAS GREAT. MY FAVORITE IS HIP HOP STAR JUST BECAUSE IT HAS A FUNKY EDGE TO IT. THIS WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MONICA'S CD WHICH IS JUST AWFUL. BEYONCE IS MATURING IN EVERY WAY. I LOVE HER SPEED AND ENERGY. IT'S AMAZING HOW GREAT OF A SHOW SHE PUTS ON SHE CAN DANCE AND SING AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT LOSING HER BREATH. I LOVE IT..<br />YOU GO GIRL
B00007EBAG|5.0|What a great CD! Sananda has got it going on from start to finish. This is the best cd of the year! I've been waiting for an album to really move me. I can't put it down. I've heard an extended tour of the US will be coming up (it's about time). Couldn't make it to the Chicago show. Great Performance of Designated Fool on Jay Leno! Hopefully Sananda will hit Minneapolis next time around...
B00005UK1F|5.0|I first heard this album when I was driving home from a vacation. well about 5 minutes into the hour long song I was hooked and knew I had found one of the greatest bands.<br />Green Carnation light of day day of darkness is one of the best albums I have ever heard. The use of so many musicians really pays off into making this a musical epic. This album has pretty much everything that I enjoy in listening to in music. They have the traditional guitar, bass, drum,  but add a symphony a choir and a nice opera solo in the middle. I would siggest everyone to buy this album for it is worth it
0385504209|3.0|Fun, fast facts about intriguing subjects (templars, paganism, big, bad catholic church, big, bad men...) I thought it would make a good afternoon movie for Lifetime for Women channel.  However, bad characterizations, flimsy plotlines, and that oh so condescending \\"all scholars agree that Christ wasn't God and Da Vinci and Newton were Goat-head wearing fertility god and goddess worshipers... like me!\\" comments denigrated from the story.  Umberto Echo in \\"Foucalt's Pendelum\\" handled the tangled web and intentional ambiguity of early Christian/Mason/Templar symbology and mythology better than this book.  My deep despair is in the book reviews written here by readers who take it all as unambiguous fact and state \\"I never knew that Christianity was nothing more than just a corruption of the TRUE naturalistic religions of Sex worshipping Pagans.  I'll just grab the kids and join the local Wicca coven.  Hope they have a Sunday School for Junior!\\"
B0000024ZI|4.0|This album is full of great riffs, but it doesn't have the spirit of Brain Capers, which predated the Ramones by several years.  Nor does it have the soulful resiliance of Mott, and the sound here is botched, to boot.  Bowie gave the album a strange mix, but the big problem is that Ian Hunter has gotten a swelled head this time around: &quot;I don't want to know you!&quot;<BR>     Hopefully Mott turned the tables on Hunter the next time around (he turned the tables on himself) and came up with the classic &quot;Hymn for the Dudes&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Mott the Hoople&quot;  This album is probably one of the first four albums by Mott the Hoople to get, along with Brain Capers, Mott, and The Hoople.  But the two albums that frame it are better bargains.
B00008CLOA|5.0|For me the questions here really are these: Is this a good multi-channel SACD? And is it worth having?<br />I believe this SACD as a resounding success. You know plenty of qualified people went over this production painstakingly, and could have really screwed it up. They didn't, though.  The surround mix is full and sensible, the bass on any good system is theater-like, and the spirit of the musical collage comes through clearly with colors flying.  If you liked this record in earlier formats, and have a SACD player, then this is a no-brainer.<br />Is it a great piece of music?  Well, maybe not. It's more like a dream, i.e. not always how you want it, but foreboding, weird, and interesting, just the same.<br />The experts can complain all they like, but the important point is that this is probably as good as most people are ever going to hear 'Dark Side Of The Moon', and there is absolutely no reason for [SACD+Pink Floyd] fans not to buy it.

1400031354|5.0|Last week I finished reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and just last night I finished reading the next one, Tears of the Giraffe.<br />  I am so tickled to have discovered another author whose work I just love. My entire family is now reading these books by Alexander McCall Smith and everyone is loving them.<br />  It isn't often you come on a book quite so fun, so interesting, so well constructed, or one that really moves you. These books are doing it to me, in spades. Tears of the Giraffe follows the lady detective, Precious, and it expands, introducing more characters, all ones that feel real, ones that are easy to care about. These books take place in Africa, in Botswana, a place that this author is putting on the map. I write too...and I am always looking for authors who can write books that are fun to read, books where I have to keep turning pages, but especially books with characters that I give a damn about. Tears of the Giraffe has it all but I would recommend that you start with the first one, No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and take it from there. Best bunch of new novels for the Summer of 2003!

But hey! this cat's no cad.  He resists the ladyfolk with a swash buckle of his sword.  And what lies at its tip?  A beautiful flower to adorn her breast.  <br />But beneath the mask there's no fun, just a face.  So onwards he goes, on an adventure that takes in the sights of my fair city.  There are tears, laughter, priests, and even sex!! Can you imagine it?  I can...<br />You may say Anarchy, but V says \\"Liberty, Liberty, LIBERTY!!!\\". VIVA VENDETTA!
B000002HEP|4.0|My review would really be 4.5, unfortunately no such option. Kyuss have created in Welcome to Sky Valley a lumbering masterpiece that combines the sludgy aesthetic of 70s metal with psychedelic instrumental interludes. The epic three and four part songs give Kyuss the room for their songs to breathe. Its easy to see how stoner rock gets applied to this, but the music more often makes me think of the red sandy expenses of the Arizona desert...this is a musical world to be lost into. Unlike I sometimes feel with QOTSA, the music is untainted by commercialism. Brilliance.
B000002WYT|5.0|To me, looking at every dave matthews band album, this is by far the most emotional, so many tracks on this record are deep and very meaningful, songs typical for Dave Matthews Band.  Whatever Dave was feeling when he wrote this, you're feeling it with him when you listen, time after time.  &quot;#41&quot; is without a doubt a classic DMB song, it's a song that can stand the test of time,  you'll always be in the mood for it and the way that this song flows naturally into the following track &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; is just unbeliveable.  Thsi album is a must have...no capitalize that...a MUST HAVE in your collection, but then again, every Dave Mathews Band album is a mus in your collection, go buy them ALL! NOW! it  will change your way of thinking, your way of life! especially if you're a musician! P.S....Carter Beauford is a GURU, a MASTER, a SENSEI on drums on &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; you can't beat that!
B00005K3LW|5.0|It's very hard to beat the first movie in a trilogy, or to even come close.  But 'Die Hard With a Vengeance' is right on it's 'older brother's' shirt tails.  It's legions better than 'Die Hard 2'.  It's got great action scenes, and Mr. Willis and Mr. Jackson make a great duo...  Great comedic timing, but not overshadowing the plot.<br />Also, Jeremy Irons as the newest villain does a wonderful job.  He plays the role very well.  <br />You can't beat Hans Gruber, but you can come pretty darn close.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Well, what can I say? Radiohead are great, anyone who loves Kid A will love this album, although a little daunting at first this album has to be one of their best, but they have produced so many good albums I have to be careful how I say that. A live album, although not all recorded at the same time was a great idea, even if it was only thrown together, it works so well, many songs have been remastered and sound even better : national anthem, LIKE SPINNING PLATES sounds so good, its a piano version, sublime. Basically if you love radiohead this wont dissapoint.
B0000640VO|5.0|It reminded me of Matilda for some reason!<BR>It's a super cute film full of societal commentaries, magic and charm.<br />It's interseting how Amelie find a man that is also just like her but in a different way. As a man he tries to fix up people's lives instead of being in a relationship by fixing up photos of people he doesn't know. Amelie does the same by fixing up actual people. It's a sweet story full of magic, love, and innocence. <br />Highly recommended- a keeper!
B000069AUI|5.0|this is a surprisingly good follow-up to parachutes, and they are equal in quality in my eyes, although rush... is more edgy. if you're looking for more mellow coldplay, get try parachutes. if you want an edgier coldplay, get rush....<br />standouts include:<BR>politik<BR>in my place<BR>the scientist<BR>clocks<BR>rush of blood to the head<br />the weakest song is whisper, but it's still good enough to keep my finger away from the &quot;next&quot; button.<br />this cd, along with parachute, has been in my player for a few months and i just don't tire of it!
B00008PC2O|2.0|when is artisan finally going to stop releasing these stupid new edition dvds? I, as well as many other consumers, are getting irate and infuriated about purchasing a DVD which we think in the right frame of mind is the best that is out there, and the best that will ever be, and then the company turns around and releases a \\"new and improved\\" version. This is the fourth version of T2, I believe, which is stupid, ridiculous, and time-consuming. First there was the regular edition of T2, which was short lived (and also long out of print). Then, they go and release the THX version with improved surround sound and commentary (also out of print, I believe). After that comes the Ultimate Edition. I own this one, because I was summoned into thinking that this was the biggie. This was the bonus version that everybody just HAD to have. This came with a new set of commentary, deleted scenes, 2 different versions of the movie, easter eggs, and among MANY, MANY different options. I haven't even had the time to explore all of them yet. Here, about 6 to 8 months later, they release a NEW version of this DVD, called the EXTREME version...how pathetic. This has everything that the Ultimate version has, except the new liquid camera movements that most people don't have the equipment and technology in their own home to handle. I think this was probably a ...poor shot at a promotion for the new T3 movie. This makes me infuriated, because they have also done the exact same with the first installment in the Terminator series. Sure, it's a great bargain that you can pick it up in stores for $$ brand new, but the fact that I had to pay [more] for mine makes me mad.<br />To the point of this review  :  If you already own T2 on DVD, then pass on this one, but if you're looking for a good installment to your series and are thinking about adding T2 to your collection, give this one a green light.<br /> -Jared
B00008H2LE|5.0|When Linkin Park's first album, Hybrid Theory, came out, I was skeptical about the group.  From the little I had heard of their song In The End, it sounded just like any other screaming Rock group.  But I then heard a full version of the song in my friend's house and was hooked.  I had been heavily anticipating their second original album (I say original because their second album, Reanimation, is a remix CD), Meteora, for months and I got it the day it was released.  When I listened to all the new songs, I was blown away.  All the songs are great, even the Foreword ties nicely into the CD, and the DVD is informational and funny (watch The Wizard Song).  Believe me, if you like Linkin Park, or if you've never heard their music, you'll love it either way.
B00005IC2H|5.0|i heard sven g englar on mtv news one day ,maybe 15 seconds of the ten minute track and bought the album that day.i was so intrigued by the music that i had to have it.i'm not quite sure if i will hear anything like it again but it has to be one of the most spiritually amazing albums i've ever heard. i'm a huge fan of The Verve's first record, &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot;, and i have been looking since 1993 for something that rivals that textured spaced out appeal. this album was it plus more. an unbelieveable exercise in musical experimentation that should not be passed up.

B00005JKN9|3.0|Overshadowed by the controversy over lobbying for Academy Award nominations, Gangs of New York is a visually stunning but flawed minor classic from director Martin Scorsese. The film concerns a forgotten period in New York City's history when a variety of gangs controlled the five corners area. Corrupt politicians, the draft (for the Civil War) and a massive wave of immigrants created a turbulent environment. A huge anti-immigrant campaign helped fuel the many conflicts between the various gangs. Scorsese also incorporates a real riot that occuried during this time. The riot required army troops to come in and prevent further looting and murder.<br />The basic story focuses on the conflict between two rival groups--the Natives led by Bill &quot;the Butcher&quot; and the Dead Rabbits an Irish immigrant group led by &quot;Priest&quot; (Liam Neeson). Their conflict leads to the death of Priest witnesses by his young son Amsterdam (later played by Leonard DiCaprio). The Butcher arranges to have the child sent to a Reform school where he's raised by Catholic Priests.<br />Upon his release Amsterdam goes looking for Bill with revenge his primary goal. What Amsterdam finds is a changed world; the Natives control much of the corrupt police force and politicians in the five corners area. Bill is well regarded and, in fact, many of the Priest's old gang members work for Bill now. Amsterdam eventually meets Bill and is treated like a son by Bill. This creates a considerable conflict as Amsterdam has developed a gruding respect for the terrifying Butcher. His life is further complicated when he becomes involved with a woman (Cameron Diaz)who was saved by the Butcher as a child.<br />The production design is stunning capturing a time in New York's history that had been long forgotten by many of its residents. The shacks, stores and buildings that make up the five corners area have an authentic appearence to them. Scorsese and his production designer Dante Ferretti manage to make the audience not only feel the environment but taste and smell it as well.  Director of photography Michael Ballhaus lighting brings a rustic feel to the environment.<br />The major problem with the film is the screenplay. It clearly passed through a number of hands besides the three screenwriters credited (Jay Cocks, Steven Zallian and Kenneth Lonergon). The first two-thirds of the film are classic Scorsese; there's a vibrantcy to the script missing from the last third. That's the problem with the film--it's two-thirds a classic. During the last act the film literally falls apart and is very narratively disjoined. It's clear that Scorsese had a much longer cut of the film in mind; there's a lot that appears to be missing from the film cut, no doubt, to make the already long running time (167 minutes) functional for a movie theater. Since this is the DVD edition, I'm surprised that Scorsese didn't go back and recut the film adding extended dramatic sequences that might have made the last third a stronger act.<br />The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis (completely immersed in his character of Bill) is stunning. His falt, slightly rounded New York accent is as much a part of the character as can be imagined. The rest of the cast give varying performances with varying success when it comes to their Irish accents. Leonard DiCaprio makes a valient attempt to equal Day-Lewis but ultimately comes up slightly short of the perfection of Day-Lewis' performance. Still, he's believable in the role and manages to command your attention when he's on screen.<br />Cameron Diaz also makes a game attempt with her role. Her character really doesn't come to life until the middle of the film. Henry Thomas (E.T., Psycho 4) gives a memorable and solid performance as Amsterdam's friend. It's a role that could have been pushed into the shadows by the lead character but Thomas invests his character with a quiet, powerful presence.<br />Scorsese's direction is sharp and it's clear he's thought longand hard about how he wanted to present this picture. His confident direction keeps the momentum of the film from dragging and, until the last act, he knows exactly where he's going and what he's trying to achieve.<br />The DVD transfer is, generally, exceptional.  The picture is nearly flawless with few of the digital compression problems that have marred similarly epic films. There's virtually no analog artifacts and the print used here is crisp, clear and clean. The 5.1 sound mix and is also representative of what you might have heard in the theater. There were some problems with the discs. The first disc ends rather abruptly. There's a scene on the second disc where the music is mixed a bit too loud for the sequence and there appears to be other sounds leaking through the mix that shouldn't be there.<br />The extras are profuse. There's a nicely done costume design feaurette and a sequence where the audience can explore the sets for the film. Additionally, there's a documentary (originally shown on The Discovery Channel)that focuses on this little known time from New York's past. It's much more than a glorified promo for the film. Scorsese's commentary is, shall we, say effusive and interesting. His intelligent comments and observations make the film come alive a second time.  While I like U2, I could have done without the music video and would much rather have seen an a couple of interviews with Day-Lewis and other cast members on their craft.<br />While it's a flawed film, Gangs of New York captures Scorsese in top form throughout most of the film. If the film doesn't hang together the way it should, it's probably due to the fact that Scorsese had to trim more from the film than he would have liked (how else to explain Neeson's appearence in what amounts to a glorified cameo?). Scorsese takes considerable risk in telling the type of story that isn't in vogue with Hollywood any longer. Gangs is an intelligent, well acted drama with a larger than life performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that makes up for some of the films shortcomings.

B00005JKN9|2.0|I never saw this at the cinema, I just bought it on DVD and watched it last night...Just wasted 20 euros on the worst Scorses film I have ever seen. Its so boring and so long. For me the best part of the whole film was the opening scene with Liam Neeson the 'Priest' talking to his son about St Michael. After that nothing of interest happens in the whole film. Daniel Day-Lewis plays his part superbly, but then he always does. He's a great actor. But I hated the costumes, that seemed over the top to me, I hated the sets, I hated the Irish folk music, the ridiculous Irish stereotypes, particularly the traditional Irish woman wearing a shawl and walking around the streets singing folk songs. Sorry Martin, Irish people don't really do that. I'm only surprised he didn't throw a few leprechaun's in for good measure. Just big ugly sets full of hundreds of ugly dishevelled people with irish folk music in the background. The final scene was a big disappointment, the Butcher should have been butchered, but was not. Oh, and Cameron Diaz is out of place. Too pretty. She should have had rotten teeth, dirty hair, then she would have looked authentic. Not even in the same league as Casino, Goodfella's, Mean-Streets or Taxi Driver.
B00008PC2O|5.0|James Cameron nailed it when he created Terminator 2: Judgement Day.  This sensational box-office blockbuster did everything right.  This DVD gives more than the original movie, which is ideal for a &quot;Terminator&quot; or an Arnold fanatic.  The wonderful action sequences are just some of the delightful idiosyncracies that keep this an enthralling action ride.  This is a great movie to add to your DVD collection especially if you are an action movie enthusiast.

B000065U1N|3.0|Our military was sent to Somalia on a humanitarian mission by Bush 1.  People were starving but we probably should have stayed out of a civil war.

1587990717|4.0|I don't know why I am writing this now, but I have had the book for some time and I have read it twice, that being an indication that it was enjoyable.  That's what it is: Fun to read.  Don't get it if you want ideas, strategies, insights into Empirica's positions, or anything resembling the preponderance of \\"How to get killer abs and rich in 7 days\\" books that are out there now..... it is not a how to, plug numbers into the formula, cookbook.  It is really just an off-the-cuff exposition/narrative/essay based on his experiences.  It is entirely subjective and, I am quite sure, offensive to some (which makes it highly entertaining, particularly if you are part of the culture).  It makes you think a bit more objectively about times when you thought that your wit, charm, and charisma got you desired results and begs the question, \\"Was I just a lucky idiot and would the same approach yield a different outcome given similar conditions?\\"  Its only shortcoming was the apparent lack of an editor - in the quest for eloquence sometimes the writing becomes overly verbose, cluttered, and halting.
B00008X5J1|4.0|This is a remarkable film on many fronts. It is sublime in its cinematography and re-creation of old New York of the mid-nineteenth century. It attempts to be all encompassing in terms of the historical context of the film, as it captures the corruption of the politics of Tammany Hall under old Boss Tweed, the Civil War draft riots, the rivalry of the prevailing gangs of the day, the contrast between the rich and the poor, the influx of immigrants into the belly of the beast, and the violence and chaos that constituted much of life in the lower class bastion that was known as Five Points.<br /><br />The film centers around its two main characters, Bill &#34;The Butcher&#34; Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis) and Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio). &#34;The Butcher&#34;, leader of an anti-immigrant gang, becomes the pre-eminent gang leader in Five Points, after he vanquishes an upstart Irish immigrant gang leader, &#34;Priest&#34; Vallon (Liam Neeson), in an all out gang war that settles the issue as to who is top dog. Now fatherless, young Vallon is sent to an orphanage. When he emerges from it sixteen years later, he returns to Five Points to avenge his father's death. Let the games begin!<br /><br />&#34;The Butcher&#34; is now a political power in Five Points to whom Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) pays homage. He is firmly entrenched in power and is guided by his own peculiar sense of honor and ethics, while remaining, at the same time, a cold blooded killer. Amsterdam manages to attach himself to &#34;The Butcher&#34; and becomes part of his inner circle. He develops an intense, almost father-son, relationship with his father's killer. In fact, his initial desire for revenge is overcome by ambivalence, until an old crony of his father reminds him of his duty, and the betrayal of a friend sets in motion certain pivotal events. Amsterdam also finds a love interest in the person of  a pretty red-head, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a pick pocket and, as is Amsterdam, a battle scarred orphan from the slums of New York.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely brilliant as &#34;The Butcher&#34;, a complex and multi-faceted villain. There is little doubt in my mind that he should have received an  Academy Award for his performance. He even got that lower class, New York accent down pat. His portrayal of &#34;The Butcher&#34; is simply unforgettable, intense and commanding. Every time he is on the screen, the viewer cannot help but be transfixed.  Daniel Day Lewis is electrifying,  a veritable chameleon and a true actor.  No matter the part, he is always unique in the role and is one of the finest actors in the world today.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is adequate in the role, but seems miscast. He is, at times, like a fish out of water, though he does the best that he can and turns in a decent, though somewhat wooden, performance. Cameron Diaz is, likewise, fine as Jenny, a role that is all but disposable. She and DiCaprio both have difficulty with their respective roles in the sense that their Irish brogues seem to come and go at will, which is a tad disconcerting.<br /><br />British character actor, Jim Broadbent, however, is terrific as Boss Tweed, one of the most corrupt politicians ever to reign in New York, lending the role a bit of gentility. Moreover, he has no problem maintaining an American accent. Henry Thomas gives a sweetly poignant performance as Johnny, Amsterdam's childhood friend, who becomes consumed by the green-eyed monster when Jenny, the girl whom he loves,  has eyes only for Amsterdam. Liam Neeson is also excellent in the role of &#34;Priest&#34; Vallon but is onscreen for merely the blink of an eye.<br /><br />This richly ambitious film focuses on the epic storytelling strengths of director Martin Scorsese. Raw, gritty, and highly atmospheric,  Scorcese's vision of nineteenth century New York is like something out of Dante's inferno and, consequently, riveting.  Coupled with the earth scorching performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, it is a film  that can easily be watched again and again.iel Day-Lewis, it is a film  that can easily be watched again and again.
B00005JM09|5.0|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a constant delight to those who revel in the world of action movies.  This movie was an entertainment powerhouse. While it didn't have the help of Linda Hamilton or James Cameron, it managed to pull its weight.  The casting of Kristanna Loken as the destructive T-X was a good decision.  The movie has impressive special effects, too.  I recommend this movie to any action movie enthusiast.  Bypass the deplorable \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" and see this movie.

Once you pick up this book you will have a classic case of 'eyes glued to book syndrom'.  Symtoms include... staying up late at night under the covers with the book in your hand, refusing to go any place with out the book, and frequent questions running through your mind of \\"what's gonna happen next?\\"<br />The Bad beginning is a great inro. to Violet, Claus, and Sunny's life, and to the rest of the series. This bok WILL make you want to read the rest of the series. DONT PASS IT UP!
B00008O0WN|2.0|In one of the bonus material commentaries Patrick Stewart says that he is proud that this film wasn't a film that just happened to be a star trek film, but he was dead wrong, that's exactly what this movie is.<br />A few stupid things about the movie were, when we last saw Worf he became a klingon ambassador. At the end of DS9 everyone was sitting at the table and signed the peace treaty ending the Dominion war. The Klingons, the Federation, and the Romulans had joined forces and became allies to defeat the Dominion. Why were the Federation and the Romulans enemies again? And I can't stand it when they try to make a star trek movie something it isn't, what was the point of having Data sing at the wedding?<br />The whole entire premise of the movie was so stupid; a clone of Picard who wanted to kill him because he believed that he was an echo of the real man. How stupid is that, this whole movie was a joke. It was a disgrace. Insurrection would have been a better way to end the next generation's journey. I've read some of the other reviews and some of the people wrote that the movie was visually stunning; I thought that Insurrection and First Contact were much more visually appealing. <br />In conclusion, this movie was a waste. I've watched the show since the beginning and I've seen all of the movies and this was by far the worst TNG movie. I would hope that they don't let it end this way, and I would think that they probably won't. After all, with such a successful show and three other great movies under their belt, why would they want to end on a low note?
B000092ZYX|5.0|There aren't many new tricks here, the fusion of electronica with hard rock is still Radiohead's staple.  The cool, ghost-melodica voice of Thom Yorke still haunts the listener over gorgeous - albeit, sad and yearning - melodies.  There are his usual vocal fits that he throws, and the screeching Guitar work that can only be found in Radiohead albums.  There are zero experimental instrumentals, which may have sounded cool when you first heard them on Kid A and Amnesiac, but then instead of growing on you they grew old.  One thing that's great about Radiohead is that after Ok Computer the rest of their albums are hard to rank; they all have their own place. Hail to the Thief is another great edition to the expanding Radiohead catalogue.
B00005JKN9|4.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" will be put beside \\"Gods and Generals,\\" \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"The Patriot\\" as one of the finest historical epics ever produced. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz do a fine job in their performances (I've never really been a huge fan of either star), the highlight of the film in terms of acting (and almost nobody will disagree with me) is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher! His performance should place him next to Darth Vader and Hannibal Lecter as one of the greatest movie villains ever to grace the screen!<br />  The film's depiction of the New York Draft Riots of 1863 is shown accurately as well as extremely graphic (this film is not for those with weak stomachs).  This film will stand the test of time, that's for sure!<br />  The DVD is great, minus the fact that the film is spliced over two DVD's (about 84 minutes on each disc). While each of the \\"Pearl Harbor\\" DVD's had to split the film because they had between four to seven audio options, this has only three! They could've put the movie and audio options on disc one, and the extras on disc two. Other than that, the DVD is worth the price!<br />Movie Grade: A+ (5 Stars)<br />DVD Grade: A- (4 Stars)
B00005N5S5|5.0|This movie started the &quot;Terminator&quot; trilogy.  It was a great achievement in the action genre of the movie entertainment industry.  &quot;The Terminator&quot; is another film that James Cameron hit the nail on the head with (excluding the travesty of a film that was &quot;Titanic&quot;).  Linda Hamilton executed an outstanding role in this movie.  I recommend this movie to those who enjoy Schwarzenegger films or action films.  Add this to your movie collection today.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film is strange, perplexing and uneasily enjoyable all at once.  You never quite know what's going on, even when it's over.  After you think about it, though, you'll be able to figure it out.  It's definately not your typical, mainstream film.  Don't let the fact that Patrick Swayze is in it fool you.  He's actually very good and wonderfully cast.<br />I know many people probably would try to sum up this film, but this is one of those great movies that's more fun to watch when you don't know a single thing about it.  If you have a taste for the unique and weird, this one won't let you down.  It's a cult classic.
0694524441|2.0|Fans of Jeremy Irons beware.  Although he is great, as usual and expected, reading this book, the writing itself is pure New Age, self-help drivel.  If I hear \\"YOU MUST FOLLOW YOUR PERSONAL LEGEND!!  LISTEN TO YOUR HEART!!\\" booming out of my car's speakers one more time . . .   The scene where the boy and the Alchemist cross the desert is a stellar example of poor, fuzzy-headed writing.  \\"You must always listen to your heart\\" begins this long, tiresome set-piece.  But sometimes your heart prevents you from achieving your personal legend, so sometimes you must NOT pay attention to it.  Oh, but other times, it is only listenting to your heart that will allow you to achieve your personal legend.  Oh, it goes on and on and on, back and forth until you just helplessly shout \\"UNCLE\\"!    And then there is the crystal seller who, oddly enough, talks as if he has been going to group therapy for the last year -- \\"I can't *deal* with being rich.\\"  Come on, Coelho, at least make an attempt to keep us inside the fantasy, instead of just trying to pass off your ad-hoc, pseudo-Judeo-Christian, self-help babble as actual literature.    Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.  Tsk.  I expected more discrimination from fabulous Humbert Humbert.
0142004235|5.0|In my opinion, East of Eden tops everything written by John Steinbeck. Although it is a biblical story, Steinback doesn't present it as such. It's a modern-day Cain versus Able story. If you liked this book, you'll probably also like From the Heart by Kendall Bell. Both of these books are very inspiring.
B00005JLKB|5.0|\\"Smallville\\" presents us with a teenage Clark Kent. Clark struggles with his superhuman powers while also coping with his undying love for Lana Lang. The problem is, Lana has a boyfriend, Whitney. The romance and the angst between Clark and Lana is so relatable, and the emotions potrayed so outstandingly by the actors. Lex Luthor is a good man. Clark has saved his life, and he is grateful. Lex enjoys his friendship with Clark. But, he also believes that Clark is an enigma. Lex is unbeknownst to the fact that he will eventually become Clark's enemy. Just as Clark's story is the developement of a hero, Lex's is the development of a villain. Lex struggles to not become like his tyrannical father, Lionel Luthor. Lionel is a cruel businessman who holds immense power in Metropolis. <br />The acting, the scripts, and the stories are superb!! Tom Welling portrays a relatble Clark Kent, Kristen Kreuk is excellent as Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex perfectly, John Glover (who is only a guest star in this season) is filled with deliciously twisted malice as Lionel Luthor, Allison Mac is flawless as quirky journalist Chloe Sullivan, Sam Jones III is great as Clark's friend Pete, and John Schneider and Annete O'Toole are good as Clark's loving parents.<br />The first season presents us with the begining of developement in the characters. It is a superb show, and one of my personal favorites I'd recommend in this season is the episode titled \\"Cool\\", about where Clark and Lana have a \\"non-date\\". CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THIS SEASON IS OUT ON DVD!! :)
B00008DDXC|3.0|I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan or anything, but I really enjoyed the first movie.  This second installment, however, didn't have that same feeling for me.  It just wasn't as exciting and some of it seemed to be stretching just a little too much.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining enough for one, maybe two viewings.  And I'm sure it's as fascinating for kids as the Wizard of Oz was for me.  But I was a lot more excited leaving the theater after the first movie than I was when I saw this one.

078322687X|5.0|One of the first teen movies, The Breakfast Club has a very basic concept.  Five teens representing the most generic types of high schoolers(the brain, the beauty, the athlete, the criminal, and the recluse) being put together in isolation for a day and the movie follows the interactions and feelings they share with each other.  It is funny at parts and sad at parts and it almost shows that everyone can be together peacefully.  Unfortunately, it is not that way in real life, and the characters even touch on how society will break each class of people apart.  They stay true to their stereotypes in the beginning and keep apart from each other; but given time, they slowly move together until they destroy their stereotypes and labels and become the same people.  You'll love all the characters and can easily relate any of them to someone from your high school.  it touches on the minds of teens and hasn't dated a bit since the 80's in my opinion.  It is an easy movie to watch again and again as it is simple in concept, yet has a powerful underlying message of morality and society.  Recommended for all because all can relate to it.<br />Score: 9.5/10
B00000IMTH|5.0|Although this album seems to suffer from being released in the wake of, and hiding in the shadow of, the bands incredible 'Rising' opus, I've always thought it is their most polished, mature and heartfelt piece of work. 'Rising' was, of course, a masterpiece, but this release seems to distill the sound they were looking for even more effectively, re-assembling the album from the basic elemnts which comprise Rainbow: Blackmore's virtuoso guitars and penchant for medievil fantasy, Powell's underrated and powerful drumming, and Dio's legendary voice (which sounds better here than almost anywhere else). The songwriting here is very tight and concise, as the title track immediately displays. Opening an album with a rock standard generally tends to work in a bands favour, yet the most important thing about this record is that it is uniformly consistent and varied, from the instantaneous declaration of intent, of a band in command of their powers that is the opening drum salvo of the title track, right through to the lengthy medievil strummings of the delicate 'Rainbow Eyes' which showcases the nuances of Dios voice to perfection. Perefctly crafted rock gems with melodies to die for are evident here ('Long Live rock and Roll','lady of the lake', 'Kill The King'), and we even have the obligatory epic: 'The gates of babylon' which rivals 'Stargazer' from 'Rising' in its strength, atmospheric keyboards, vivid lyrics, and a barrel full of classic riffs combining to make, for me, Rainbows best extended track. Add to this the stompy funk of 'LA connection' and we have a marvelouslly rounded record, cobmbining dark and light, mystical and commonplace, melodic and raucous.<br />This, I believe, is Rainbows best album, but not only that, it represents Blackmore and Dio's best work together, which is no mean feat. It is also one of the best hard rock/early metal albums of the 70's, rivalling the mighty Deep Purple in places, so I would urge any fan of the genre to pick it up swiftly.<br />This is not as essential as any of the classic albums by Deep Purple, Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin, but is still a seminal work by a superstar laden band.BR>This is not as essential as any of the classic albums by Deep Purple, Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin, but is still a seminal work by a superstar laden band.

B000059H99|5.0|This is the great story of the lovable underdog successfully pursuing his dream.  It is both one of the best boxing movies ever and truly a classic movie, winning an Oscar for Best Picture.  I loved watching Rocky exert himself for his goal, and the climactic battle keeps you completely entranced in the movie.  You have to root for the underdog and support Rocky through his troubles.  The musical montage was one of my favorite scenes, as well as the last battle.  What I didn't like about the movie, however, is the love story on the side between him and Adrian.  I guess I would just rather watch Rocky beat the hell out of a slab of meat or do exercises I didn't even know were physically possible than watch him take Adrian ice-skating.  It does fit though, because it shows more into Rocky's life and makes him more desperate for our support.  Good performances, great fights...a required film for all movie buffs.<br />Score: 9/10
B00005JKN9|5.0|The movie is quite powerful and the more I learn about the time period and the work that went into it, the more amazed I am.  Perhaps it suffers from \\"Apollo 13\\" Syndrome in that the research and effects that went into it are just too damn good that they aren't even recognized.  But as you realize that this place no longer exists in the same form and they had to literally re-create that entire portion of the city from scratch and that the information on the day-to-day aspects of life there was sketchy at best, you come to know what an amazing creation this is.  Early life in America wasn't pretty, but it made us a strong people, who we are today.  And it's amazing the corruption of the Democrats hasn't changed much, as I'm watching Calif go bankrupt to line pockets.  All the more reason to face history, so we don't make the same mistakes.

Some people may say its to violent but really why are you going to pay for 20 dollars for a movie that you really do not know about. This movie is like a Machiavellian tale, which Nicolo Machoveli came back in real life after 7years and killed all his enimes, he was a great Italian philsopher. A lot about this movie is great, it fells real because the acting is good and Brandon Lee died filming this movie. Their is 2 other Crow movies, City of Angels(Vincent Perez, and The Crow Salvation (with some guy and Kristen Dunts) which those movies are not even good. Now they are going to make another Crow movie The Crow:Last Preyer staring the kid in T2 and American History X. Dont waste your time, just watch this tale. R.I.P. Brandon Lee, we still miss you.
0156027321|4.0|I suspected this book was going to be heavily spiritual and along the lines of fantastic realism, which I don't care for, and that there would be talking animals in it. So to any one with the same suspicions, let me assure you that the animals behave like animals and you don't have to be the spiritual, soul-seeking type to enjoy this book. Don't be put off by the first part of the story, which I didn't find too captivating. You will soon be pulled in. The story was convincing and the subject matter was, I felt, very well researched by the author, though granted I don't know much about religion, zoology, or the ocean. The one thing I found lacking was character development, and the occasional verbalizations from Pi were very prosey, but then the story is being told from the perspective of Pi 20 years later. <br />Beyond any higher meaning wrapped around the central story, it's just a really good story about survival. It's also very funny. The ending is stunning. I never did understand what the story has to do with religion or God, but it did leave me thinking.  Normally I get my books from the library, but I'm glad some one bought this one for me as it's definitely worth a second read (and I was 152nd on the waiting list at the library).
B00005JM09|3.0|The good news is that although Terminator 3 is not as satisfying and well crafted as original ones it is still entertaining.  As far as an action a movie goes, T 3 is has it all.  There are gun battles, astonishing explosions, great robot against robot fight scenes, and a cool car chase.  In fact the car chase was so good that it even comes close challenging the throne of the Matrix Reloaded 14-minute gateway scene.  <br />One of the reasons that made me go to see T 3 on the opening day was not so much a prospect of being entertained by an intense action/sci-fi but extreme curiosity on how this film actually turned out.  At first I refused to believe that the creators of T3 could pull off the same exact story of killer robot vs. the protector and actually make it interesting.  But I was wrong.  Even though the formula is recycled for the third time, it still has some pleasantly surprising freshness left in it.  I was happy to realize that for a moment I was so immersed in what was going on that I actually stopped thinking about how old Arnold really is. <br />Unfortunately, after walking out of the theater room I felt like there was something missing in T3.  I didn't get the same level of satisfaction as in previous Terminator movies.  The whole filmed seemed to be short and rushed.  The emotional involvement was shallower as well.  It was almost as if the director and actors wanted to get done with the whole deal as soon as possible so that they can start on a sequel.  And sequel there will be, for T3 end on rather depressing, sequel hungry point almost equivalent, once again, that of the Matrix Reloaded. <br />Another problem I found was that the actor chosen to play the threatening Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken) was in my opinion very poorly chosen.  To play a dangerous Terminator one should at least try to appear threatening.  Not for the sake of realism (having a look of a fragile woman is actually tactically deceiving) but for the sake of greater drama.  When looking at Kristanna I could not stop thinking of how beautiful she was and those thoughts alone overwritten the conception of her as a deadly cyborg; a cyborg we should be terrified by.  Kristanna's beauty counteracted her intended purpose of inspiring awe.  A perfect person for this role would actually be a bulky, mean-looking, cold-featured guy with an average mugger profile.  <br />Even though T3 is not without glitches, I would strongly recommend this film to action fans.  Yes, it is unsatisfying and on top of it, it ends with yet unsatisfying ending.  Yes, it doesn't make us flex our brains or bite or nails with excitement.  And although it tries, it doesn't blow away an average movie fan with its CGI and action moments.  However, after the hard day of work, when it is time to rest and forget the day's worries, this is a good movie to relax to.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Obviously, if you think \\"Linkin Park\\" is horrible than you completely have no taste in music at all.  Do not listen to the people who are giving negative thoughts about \\"Meteora\\" because they have no thought in music, they just like plain boring music and nothing new.  Linkin Park puts alot of thought into there music and all of there songs comes out nearly perfect.  They have been writing Meteora for more than a year.  It took \\"Mike Shinoda\\" 6 years to complete \\"Breaking The Habit.\\"  It's rare to see that in music.  \\"System of a Down\\" is the only other band that I can think of that came out with a perfect album, \\"Toxicity\\" because they are also interesting with there music, they don't use the plain stupid thing all the time.  I know how hard it is to write and make up beats similar to there music because I also have a band called \\"Ainoko.\\" My band is a mix of these two bands I have mentioned just now, something different and not the same boring material. I have been writing one track to my demo CD for months now because it takes alot of effort and time to create a perfect song. Linkin Park does the same thing to create music, they take it to the limit and don't slop down a song and call it music, like Avril for instance.  So take my advice and buy this album because it is definitely worth buying. And another thing, That one other kid James on this review thing thought Chester Benningtons voice was really bad.  How is that possible because it does not sound scratchy or painfull to listen to at all. Chester was actually sick when he recorded \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and \\"From The Inside\\" and he still sounded incredible. Don't listen to that kid or other people that diss Chester because they have really bad taste. Chester's voice is incredible.  It will put chills down your spine.  It's so clear and its character is very unique.  \\"My December\\" shows this trate of his very well.  That track is on there first single \\"One Step Closer.\\"

She is great and wonderful addition to the group i hope she stays with the group. Cause her melodies bring a new dimension to the Group.<br /> As on past efforts, the group always incorporates a variety of eclectic sounds and beats, such as old-school rap samples, Latin grooves, and dancehall riddims. In 2000, the Peas garnered crossover success with \\"Request Line,\\" their collaboration with Macy Gray, and here they up the ante by recruiting a breathless Justin Timberlake to back up Fergie's beautiful soulful voice... for the first single, \\"Where Is the Love,\\" which touches on  issues including the war on terrorism and discrimination. Other guest on the album include reggae vet Tippa Irie on the Sean Paulreminiscent \\"Hey Mama\\" and Papa Roach on the rap-rock anthem \\"Anxiety,\\" where wailing guitars preside over the the Peas vocals and raps elementary flows. Only on \\"Sexy,\\" which has a romantic rap with guitar and piano lines from bossa nova legend Sergio Mendes, does the foursome's magic  fully gel. When left on their own -- as on the tracks sing-along tracks as \\"Hands Up\\" and \\"Fly Away\\" -- Black Eyed Peas show their true colors and really reach the dazzling creative heights they're capable of which is greatness.

0385474547|3.0|While this novel is not a \\"page turner\\", the latter part of the book and the significance of the ending are both testaments to the cherished beliefs of cultures. <br />Okonkwo, the book's main protagonist, is determined to stray from the lifestyle and eventual degradation that his fathered suffered in life due to laziness and debt. He is an African tribe man who is hard-hearted and stern towards his family because he wants to become something great in life (although some may view him as a chavanist). The tribe's rituals are followed with grave tradition, and Okonkwo seeks for ways to better his personal status (although not a literal translation, one's fate is referred to as \\"chi\\", meaning \\"personal God.\\")<br />The story is divided into 3 major sections. The first section deals with mainly Okonkwo's family and tribal background; we get a first hand look at their beliefs in marriage and status of tribal leaders. The 2nd part shifts into Okonkwo's removal from his village, and his eventual progression back into his society. Finally, the most compelling part of the tale, the third section  highlights Okonkwo's orientation back into his village as well as  his and other tribes' encounters with the new community which has brought Christianity into the region; subsequently, there is a clash of power between African religion and culture and the Christian believers. <br />Several points may make this book less than appealing. <BR>One of the more exasperating aspects of reading this type of novel is getting acclimated to the Ibo vocabulary and expressions (although in this version, there is a glossary included in the back index). There are relatively trite topics included, such as a chapter on the process of harvesting yams, but my belief is that these chapters are mainly to get the reader accustomed to the values and background of African tribal life. It is necessary to read this book with a certain degree of respect for different cultures and the rituals they share. <br />Although it moved a little too slow at the beginning, the  eventual story of Okonkwo's rise and fall becomes more intriguing as the reader moves on. Not only is Achebe's novel a commentary on the ills of clashing religions and cultures, but the reverence placed on position and status in individual tribal communities. This is an excellent read for those who want to get a sense of tribal life or religion in African cultures. For those who just want a leisurely read, it may take some patience getting into this novel.
B000002J6H|5.0|Can't help but join the rabid chorus of punters who are wondering what the Amazon reviewer was on when he (or she?)wrote their diatribe.  This album is a masterpiece that has never been accorded the respect it richly deserves.  Every song has a magical quality that occasionally emerges in the rather more stilted CSNY product, but never with the same effect. \\"This is a song about a card game....\\" still, after all these years, sends a slight tingle down my spine.  I'm no musician, so won't even pretend to know whether the playing is good or bad - but I know what I like, and I like what I hear on this album. Bluegrass, rock, blues, gospel - its all there, in one neat package that many have tried to emulate, but few have ever succeeded to the level that SS did on this outing.  As to his contribution to CSNY, as some have commented on, does it matter? CSNY was effectively a backup band for each of its members to perform their own songs in their own way. As far as Stills and Young are concerned, Young's pinnacle was his solo \\"Harvest\\", and this is Still's.  The other two never made the starting line, other than the sole CSNY pop record. Deja Vu was OK, but SS1 is the album I'll keep on listening to.

B0000057C5|4.0|Nevertheless,its still an excellent album.If you want to get this one,i recomend it,but i would still recomend Mutter first if you are a new Rammstein fan.My favorite tracks:<BR>Engel<BR>Buck Dich<BR>Spiel Mit Mir<BR>Tier<BR>Du Hast<BR>Sehnsucht
B000077VR3|3.0|While this movie was technically brilliant and pleasing to look at, I believe this movie is overrated. Baz Lurhmann did a great job putting this movie together, but it was just a bit too much. First off, I love musicals and when I first saw this in the theaters, I was dazzled at it and rejoiced in the return of the movie musical. For this reason, I will give thanks to this movie, because it paved the way for the far superior movie and musical, Chicago, to win Best Picture the following year...but I think that this movie, on second viewing, wasn't as good as the first time seeing it...I guess the first time I saw it, it was more of a novelty thing because it was a muscial. I think the singers in this movie, with the exception of Nicole Kidman, are just plain awful...Does Ewan McGregor have to shout everytime he sings?? Even when he sings soft notes, it sounds as if he is shouting. The first 30 miutes or so with all that camera movement was awful...it felt like the director was trying to do too much and make it unique, but it ruined the movie. Overall, it was just an OK movie but an awful musical...horrible, borrible singers...
B00005OM4Q|4.0|I love this film. And it's not only because Cameron Crowe and I are close in age so we grew up during the same time, but the cast for this film was well selected and the film is well shot. The music, both the scoring and the period pieces, are great choices and in the case of the score well produced. <BR>Almost Famous depicts a time in our/my lives when everything not only seemed possible but those same things took on some mystical sense which Cameron is quite able to depict because he was there. <BR>Not enough can be said of Cameron's experience in these matters. He was in the right place at the right time to see, hear and appreciate all those things he used in this film. <BR>Yes, there was a war on but our awareness of it was not always taken over by the politics surrounding it. This films captures the joy it was to see and be with a rock group that was growing in popularity and status. <BR>But back to the film itself. As I said a good cast that was well thought out. It doesn't always happen that the right people play the right parts. All to often an actor or an actress gets by in a part but only because the vehicle is good and not because of their part in it. In this case though the players fit the rolls they're assigned to and play them very well. It also doesn't hurt that Kate Hudson has her mother's adorable smile and giggle or that Billy Crudup did a spectacular job with his role as does Patrick Fugit, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee and everyone else. <BR>The appropriate venues were used and the depiction of products, vehicles, music gear and clothes were all very well done. Nothing seemed to be out of place. The language used in the screenplay was very good and (dare I say it) right on. <BR>There are a few questionable edits and some small continuity problems but I only was aware of them after multiple viewings. <BR>A great film depicting a time that, although, has been seen before in film was never as well played out as it is in this film.
0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises is a rather low-key book.  Written in a terse, almost hard-boiled style, it tells the story of a wasted group of Americans and Brits living and caring for nothing in Europe after World War I.  The events, some of them rather traumatic, never seem to touch the core of these people thus giving that idea that, more all their self-worship and high-faulting ideas regarding man, nature and the way things ought to be, there is really nothing to them.<br />It is a good book, a swift read that carries you along through a series of aimless adventures that have a great deal of depth.  The exploration of what is missing in these people makes up the bulk of the story, events getting worse and worse while the characters remain stangely unaffected.  Events even seem to repeat themselves, again and again, in different circumstances and locales, something with even differing participants (although there is really no reason to tell them apart).  One gets the feeling, in later years, of a fushion of a Henry James morality tale crossed with the heartless indifference of Bret Easton Ellis' monsters--it really does go that far in explaining Hemingway's influence on the generations of writers that followed him in light of those dismissed that came before him.<br />It is a book that, for me, discounts a little of Hemingway's claim as 'a stylist that changed American writing forever' as I see much of Dashiell Hammett modified into something attempting to paint a picture in black and white instead of with a blood-splashed gray.  It truly is a fine book but one (if this critique can be regarded as anything) that leaves one a little uncertain of comment and that gives the impression that, perhaps, it may very well be forgotten three pages into the next book undertaken.
067101756X|5.0|The Day After Roswell is an excellent and well written text that reveals how the capture of a crashed alien space vessel at Roswell in 1947 jump started technological development across a broad spectrum. Since its author is revealing government secrets and the rationale behind the secrecy, it calls into question what his motives were in writing. If this is an expose' then he is in violation of his oath of secrecy and could be prosecuted. As such, it seems unlikely that this is disinformation, since it contradicts the standard government stance that UFOs don't exist. On the other hand, it may be something the government authorized, even asked Col. Corso to do, as part of a plan to reveal gradually what has been going on for the past half century. (Notice that a few years thereafter the gov't foisted yet another false story about what happened at Roswell. Reminds me of a little kid who got caught stealing from the cookie jar and keeps making up one story after another to avoid admitting their guilt.)<br />This revelation raises further questions. Why would aliens wait for us to improve our technology if their intentions were belligerent? The answer may be simple. Since they are apparently studying us in much the same fashion that we do various forms of wildlife, such as radio tagging grizzly bears, they may have underestimated our capacity to adapt their technology and come up with a viable defense to them. Also, if we intentionally shot down one of their craft over Germany in 1974, more than a quarter of a century ago, what has been the status of this 'war' from then until now? Are they still buzzing our planes and spacecraft? Still experimenting on cattle and humans? What has been the effect of demonstrating our ability to stop them, or is it illusory that we can? Is the real purpose of this book to say that yes, ET is really there but we now have a defense against them, even though we don't? If so, this is a different kind of disinformation.<br />All of this callsinto question another consideration. Why is it that we are planning to go to Mars while having bypassed the moon as a base of operations?  Certainly the latter has little gravity, so escape velocity requirements are minimal compared to taking off from earth. Are the space stations intended for that purpose as an alternative? I vividly remember listening to Neil Armstrong as he took mankind's first steps on the moon in 1969. Our (vacuum tube) TV broke so we had to listen on the radio. He distinctly stated that he saw lights coming from a nearby crater. Later I read that when he went over to the crater, there was an alien craft and they telepathically told him that we were to stay off of the moon. After a few missions we stopped going there. What is the real reason? Since one side of it always faces the earth, it makes an ideal observation post to watch this planet. And do we keep losing expensive probes that we send to Mars as soon as they arrive there because ET is destroying them?<br />Read the book. Answer your own questions, and ask new ones.<br />P.S. Having worked a summer job as a teen at Fort Belvoir, the home of the U.S. Army's Corp of Engineers, the local references that Col. Corso cites were particularly personally poignant for me.
B00005JKN9|5.0|It took Martin Scorcese 25 years to start production of \\"Gangs of New York\\".  Had he started any sooner, it may not have resulted so magical.  The special effects and the art direction are amazing.  Who knew that so much blood could be so magical?<br />     Daniel Day-Lewis deserved his Oscar nomination for this role.  He never loses his character for one second.  Leonard DiCaprio made an amazing comeback with this film, which he was dissed for the Oscar, as was Cameron Diaz.  She proves that thieves can be emotional(this can only happen on screen).  For that, I expected her to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress before the nominations were released.<br />     \\"Gangs of New York\\" may also be a history lesson of how the Irish and other immigrants/minorities had to fight oppression in the 1800's.  If you are sensitive to graphic violence/war scenes, you may want to choose another movie.  Otherwise, you will be very satisfied of Martin Scorcese's outcome.

B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead showcases their true original work in &quot;Amnesiac&quot;.  Their signature experimental sound on this album expresses their true creativity.  Many call this the sequel to &quot;Kid A&quot;, but it's not.  There are some of the same ideas, but they continue to evolve as they do between each album.  Unlike &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; has a little more hints of rock, which proves their musical expansion.<br />     I've had &quot;Amnesiac&quot; for two years, and I still find new reasons to love it.  For you, if it took more than one listen to like &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; may be the same way.  However, you'll be glad you did.
B00005JM03|5.0|I had no doubts when I purchased the ticket for this movie. I knew that it was going to be a good one.<br />The plot of this movie was well developed: a team of highly trained thieves successfully steal gold from under the feet of the owner (literly) only to be double crossed by one of there own. This is where the famous quote \\"revenge is a bit**\\" comes in.<br />If you like a movie with humor, drama and a good old fashion car chase with a modern day twist, or if you want to take the family out to see a movie, this honestly is the movie to go see.
0440237688|5.0|Story: Jonas lives in a new futuristic \\"perfect\\" world. No pain. No wars. But no true feelings. No color. No pleasure. No love. It's a dull dull world, not to mention boring. Jonas is selected to be the Receiver, the person who gets ALL the past memories of life before the \\"Sameness\\" (when everyone made the move to become as similar as possible) so that no one else will have them or feel them. But Jonas thinks that the world SHOULD see and have these memories because with the pain, comes great benefits. It isn't really living unless you them. What will Jonas do to satisfy his desire to share it with the world? <br />Comments: I love this book. I love all the science fiction books I've read so far. It makes you feel sad for the people in his world since there is no true feelings and stuff like that but it makes you appreciate your world. It frustrates me because no one praises differences and uniqueness...they all run from it. The ending is very satisfying. READ THIS BOOK! It's a great book. I think everyone should read it.
B000002AGN|5.0|.<br />Pianist Dave Brubeck found jazz at about the time jazz found its coolness.<br />Even now, more than 40 years down the track, the man and the quartet he gave his name to remain a potent force.<br />\\"Time Out\\" is very much the signature album of this amazingly talented foursome.  Recorded in 1959, it still shines.<br />Its clarity and style and the richness of its improvisations make it a joy to hear.<br />For me, the standout track is \\"Strange Meadow Lark\\" with its sad, laconic and highly melodic theme presented and then superbly re-interpreted by Brubeck and friends.<br />The set's most noted track, \\"Take Five\\", is also a remarkable piece.<br />Saxophonist Paul Desmond (who also wrote it) gives a crystal clear enunciation of the probing melody as it floats over Brubeck's driving downbeat chords.<br />Bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello simply sparkle during their solo spots here.<br />\\"Kathy's Waltz\\" is another winner with its upbeat and deliberate melody line.<br />In structure and style it is not unlike the future works of Dudley Moore.<br />Brubeck and company brought a unique elegance to the world of 50s and 60s jazz and this album is their finest outing.<br />The message they preach is highly accessible and definitely worth hearing.<br />\\"Time Out\\" - simply timeless. FIVE STARS!
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down started out with this CD in 1998. These guys aren't just any ordinary band from L.A. trying to suck you into buying their CD's. SOAD lures you into their music with inspiring lyrics and tone. This band is about politics, not like rap artists who sing about their money and chrome spinners, Serj tells you how your life is lead into a world of money scrounging governments who tell you to kill your own kind. Now unlike newscasters who filter important information from you, System tells you what that is. CNN and those other news companies don't want you to know how the war is really going on, they sell you lies. Not only does System tell you what is going on right now, they tell you what has happened in the past and what will happen again in the future. I bet most of you haven't even heard about the genocide against the Armenians back in the early 1900's, guess who was behind it.. Adolf Hitler. System's heritage is Armenian, they let the people know what's going to happen if you don't act now. There shouldn't be a Government, they keep information from you so you won't riot and start a ruckus. System's albums will keep you coming back for more to learn about our ancestors and how they were treated, they tell you what's really going on in our world and how we're slowly killing our lovely Mother Earth. So if you want to know more about what I'm talking about, listen to System's music and you'll see what I mean.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Although they have sold millions and millions of albums worldwide, Led Zeppelin never released a legitimate live release in their catalogue.  The live albums released prior to this DVD collection - THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME (1976) and THE BBC SESSIONS (1997) - were dismal examples of what Zeppelin truly must've sounded like on stage during the '70s.  It's been a long time coming, but Jimmy Page and company have come back full force with a titanic two-DVD box set simply titled LED ZEPPELIN.  These two discs contain over four hours of never-before-seen live footage of the band that captures every period of their career, as well as fascinating bonus material like interviews, rare TV appearances, and even two music videos from 1990.  <br />It also goes without saying that these are, by far, the best-sounding and best-looking DVDs I've ever seen.  Not even a regular movie DVD sounds as great as the concert footage does here.  We have Jimmy Page and his collaborator Dick Carruthers to thank for that.  These old and once worn-out images have been painstakingly remastered and restored for our viewing pleasure, and the sound and picture quality are so good, you actually feel like you're there at these concerts.  Add to the fact that these performances showcase Zeppelin at their absolute best, which really brings life to the proceedings.<br />The first DVD contains the entire (almost) performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.  Since the band only released two albums by this point, most of the set is comprised of songs from those albums as well as cover tunes and long improvisational jams.  This was a band that were still young and hungry.  The rollicking opener \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" kicks things off to a frenzied start, and segues into the slinky Otis Rush blues of \\"I Can't Quit You Baby,\\" followed by the extended version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" with Jimmy Page making sounds with a violin bow never heard before coming out of a guitar.  \\"White Summer\\" is a lovely 12-minuteinstrumental with just Page and his guitar and Bonham adding percussion where needed.  Speaking of Bonham, he really goes off the wall during his famous lengthy drum solo \\"Moby Dick.\\"  The fact that Bonzo can do all these rhythms on such a small kit is astonishing, and when he puts the drum sticks down and starts beating the drums with his hands, I was in awe.  The closing medley of \\"C'mon Everybody,\\" \\"Something Else,\\" and \\"Bring It On Home\\" brings the concert to a fiery end.  A truly great early performance, but it can't compare to the goodies found on DVD 2.<br />Even better than the first disc, the second DVD is comprised of three different performances - Madison Square Garden (1973), Earls Court (1975), and the Knebworth Festival (1979) - and grainy footage of \\"The Immigrant Song\\" to create one full, non-stop concert.  Each concert is segued flawlessly into the next and it works wonderfully.  The 1979 Knebworth performance is my favorite of the bunch; it's definitely the most intense in this entire collection.  Instead of playing favorites, here are the highlights of these performances: hard and heavy versions of \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"The Ocean,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\"; the poignant acoustic triple play of \\"Going to California,\\" \\"That's the Way,\\" and \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\"; the blistering Gothic blues workout \\"In My Time of Dying\\"; and the definitive versions of the epics \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" and \\"Kashmir.\\"  Also worth mentioning are the liner note booklets, written by hard rock expert Mick Wall which are a fascinating read into the making of the DVDs.<br />I don't think I can say enough. This is the best documentation of Zeppelin's live material ever done, before and since.  From the sound/picture quality, to the energy, to the performances, and to those great improvs, the LED ZEPPELIN box set is pure rock history, fresh and revitalized once again.
0553381350|5.0|This book is just a thoroughly enjoyable read.  Funny, exciting, charming, moving; what more could you want?  It does certainly personalize the astronauts, but I do not agree that it cuts these heroes down to size, as some other reviewers have suggested.  On the contrary, Mr. Wolfe's theme is that these men really are heroes, albeit thoroughly human ones.  He does, however, let us know that there are a lot of other men out there who are just as heroic, without the acclaim.  Don't miss this one!
B00005JM0B|5.0|i would just like to say that this movie is really good.  i could not stand looking at some of the reviews it got from people who not even seen it.  the movie i thought was very good indeed and you should go and see it.  i hope those people who gave this movie a bad review even without seeing it will go and see it and see how good of a movie it is.  i think people should not even be able to give an review without seeing the movie and i hope you go and see it and not listen to people who have not even seen the movie.
B00008NG5V|2.0|This is my first hearing of Jack Johnson, whose album I finally bought after Amazon.com's fine recommendations robot kept telling me to go buy this or \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\".<br />This album certainly sets a mellow groove. I plan to see if listening to this and Norah Jones back-to-back will cure my insomnia.<br />The lyrics are excellent examples of what pass for thoughtful these days, particularly, I suspect, if accompanied by the lady Mary Jane, who brings out the cleverness in everyone, or something.<br />I heartily recommend this disc to sophomores and juniors in small liberal arts colleges, people of like mind, and Barry Zito.
0812523008|5.0|This book was very interesting. Right from the get-go R. Neville explained his situation, and through the book he dropped details as to how the vampire \\"plague\\" came about. Eventually discovering for himself all possible methods of killing them (trial & error), and facts about their orgin. The weirdest part of the book is how it skips ahead months or even years at a time. I'm surprised the guy wasn't completely psychotic... being the last of his kind and all.

0316666343|2.0|Many people recommended this book to me.  The first quarter of the book captured my interest with the crime, but failed to keep me going. I skimmed the book very quickly for the second half and put it down.  I am glad I did not purchase the book.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This is a great add-on to Kid A and Amnesiac:  in the same vein, but different enough that you know they are exploring new ground.  Most songs stand well on their own, but also work well in the album as a whole.  I was reminded, especially on track 6, of that old 80's band \\"Simple Minds\\".  Great bass licks, which I've always been a sucker for.  If you liked the previous two albums, this one's a cinche.
0375758992|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book.  Alexandra Fuller is an amazing writer, taking the reader into the scene as if we were standing next to her.  It is beautifully written.  Since I was 8 years old I have dreamed of going to Africa and living in similar circumstances and situations as she describes in her book.  <br />An excellent memoir!  I've read it three times already...and have recommended it to everyone that I know who loves a great read.  I am inspired even more to finally make it to Africa.
B000001FKY|5.0|How many 'classic' and 'great' cliches can you stand?<BR>None of them can do this album justice, it is simply as close to musical perfection as you can get.<br />It's not metal per-se, just staggeringly good, high quality, very accessible, mega-listenable pop. Listening to it 16 years after it first came out, (and when I first bought it), it still stands out as one of the great albums of all time, never bores. If you're bored with 90's/21st century pop, go back to '87.  You'll wish you'd been born twenty years earlier. This is up there with the best albums of all time - 17 million free willed buyers can't be wrong.<br />Go to go, need to buy another backup copy, just in case this one wears out...
0385720920|5.0|This is the first book by Palahniuk that I have read and it will not be the last....I just stumbled upon this book while in a rush on my lunch hour....the description on the back intrigued me and I liked the movie \\"Fight Club\\"  - two days later the book was finished....every second I got I found myself pulling it out of my bag...just trying to read a little more on the life of Victor Mancini.<br />Victor's life is anything/everything except boring....a drop out medical student that has a full time job by day in a old colonial theme park and choking at various restaurants around town by night to make some lucky person feel like a hero - AND what is all this for? Well, many reasons....you'll have to get the book!  Victor sounds pretty busy with all this going on but he still finds time to visit his mother who suffers from alzheimer's and classes for sex addicts.<br />Believe me - this is a must read, a page turner!  Palahnuik has a way of describing each character and the scenarios will have you laughing out loud.  I can not wait to read another book by Palahnuik.
B000002H38|5.0|Although I do not listen to this genre of music as often as before and have not for many years, I must say at any given time I were to begin listening to R&amp;B/soul again seriously, Anita Baker's music would be one of my first choices. This album Sweet Love is the essence of &quot;everlasting&quot; contemporary soulful music sung by a singer whose voice is like no other. After being in the market for years which seems like a lifetime but definitely over fifteen it's still so good to listen to. This is certainly an album that's timeless, priceless, precious, inspirational and soulful. If you are looking for modern, soulful R&amp;B give this one a try. R&amp;B albums are certainly not of this caliber anymore. It's seems like Anita Baker is on a permanent career hiatus but she sure left her legacy behind. Thank you Anita, your talent has not gone unrecognized!

B000089RVX|4.0|I bought this song on the strength of the bands single &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; and on Amy Lee's (at times) stunning vocals. <BR>I thought some of the songs were indistinguishable the first time i listened to the album but on just the second listen, when i was actually listening to it, i found i liked pretty much every song!<BR>The comparisons to Linkin Park are obvious, this band being pretty much a carbon copy with a female singer, but what a singer. On the other hand comparisons between Amy Lee and Tori Amos are completely absurd, the latter being in a class of her own. <BR>Anyway the point is the CD's good, not groundbreaking material but not much is these days and this band is at least a change from the mediocre efforts we get from most bands.<BR>Well done evanescence
B00005JKCH|2.0|A: 2/5 Stars<br />  Unless you are a superhero buff I wouldn't reccommend this movie to anyone.  <BR>  Long + Predictable = Boring.  That's exactly what this movie was.  Sure, the action scenes were loud and big, but they are neither believable or original, and all they did was keep me awake.  <BR>  I would tell you the ending and all that, but I want you to see how sadly predictable this movie is.  Or maybe you should just not waste any time or money on it.<br />J: 2/5 Stars<br />  spider-man is a comic book hero movie with a sadly undeveloped story and pointlessly cartoonish action sequences. it is the kind that begs to be considered good but falls below average. the story is about a teen outcast who receives \\"special powers\\" from a genetically enhanced spider on a field trip to a science lab. this leads to a bunch of computer  animated action scenes where the hero tests out his new abilities. The problem with these scenes is that they are more fake and inexplicable than real and at least somewhat believable. they are loud and flashy and serve as eye candy for the blind. the story is the standard version of the comic and does nothing special to surpass it's expectations (Although i liked the sweetness in the relationship with the boy and his grandfather). after a sudden tragedy, spidey realizes that he should use his superhuman abilities for good.this leads to the meeting of harry osborne who is also mutated into the green goblin, one of the series most infamous villains. their final confrontation is staged to be suspenseful but is anything but.<BR>the movie's lesson:with great power comes great responsibility. sam raimi(who is not a stranger to superhero films with Darkman) seems to have slapped the movie together and goes for the wrong vibe by putting in too many stupid action scenes instead of developing the characters and the story/plot. the actors do the best they can with what they have been given but the movie falls too short. spider-man is an unenternaining slog through cartoonish action sequences and a thin story.
B000002JR8|5.0|On their first album, 1990's Cowboys From Hell, Pantera, it seemed where trying to find themselves.  They were thrashy sounding.  Phil Anselmo whailed on some songs the way an 80's hair metal vocalist would.  And guitarist Diamond Darrell, as he was called at the time, wrote riffs nearly as complex as early Metallica and Megadeth.  I still can't play the main riff to Cowboys From Hell without messing up!  Then, with their next release, 1992's Vulgar Display Of Power, they took the formula of their first album and gave it a much needed kick.  The singles, \\"Walk\\", and \\"This Love\\" made it the band's classic ablum, and a very overrated one at that.<BR>But with this, there third release in 1994, they decied to do nothing more than give the most brutal performances they could.  And that's just what they did.  The then newly-christened Dimebag Darrell has the heaviest tone in all of metal.  A life time of cigarettes and booze had taken it's toll on Phil's voice by this point, as heard throughout the entire album.  But it was for the better.  Bassist Rex Brown just growls like a monster here, and Dime's brother, drummer Vinnie Paul strikes like thunder.  He is the king of metal drums.  This album is all intensity from beginning to end.  One listen will demonstrate why this album debut at #1 on the Billboard charts.  Enjoy!
630471193X|4.0|A: 5/5 Stars<br />  John Travolta is phenomenal in the phenomenal movie &quot;Phenomenon&quot;.  <BR>  The movie is about George Malley, a simple guy of average intelligence who works in a garage in his small California town.  During his birthday party, he walks outside and looks up at the sky.  He sees a flash of light, and is knocked down to the ground.<BR>  Gradually, he discovers he can do supernatural things, like move objects without touching them, sensing ultrasonic waves to predict earthquakes, and learning a foriegn language in 20 minutes.  <BR>  This movie provides solemn moments and funny moments.  After a sneaky and totally unpredictable little twist in the story (regarding the mysterious flash of light and what causes Malley's powers), we find what the movie's message really is.  <BR>  I'll shut up now so you can go watch it and be amazed.  The title says it all.  <BR>  <BR>J: 4/5 Stars<br />  phenomenon is a screen gem. it might not be perfect but it sure hits close to home in our hearts. it is about a man, played by john travolta, who on his birthday sees a flash of light in the sky and is knocked off his feet. when he arises he is different or feels different at least. what did he see in the night sky? a UFO? a hallucination? part of the magic of phenomenon is finding out at the end what the light really was.but phenomenon is much more than that.<BR>     it takes place in a quaint little town where everyone knows eachother and no secrets can be kept without your neighbor knowing. everyone meets in the conventional bar where they find out things from others. George Malley is a humble mechanic who is your average straight guy. he is is in love with the town recluse and is a close aquaintance with her kids. after the encounter on his birthday, everything changes. his intelligence seems to have been ameliorated. now, he reads five books a day, can remember nearly everything, and has the ability to move things with his mind. the townspeople first react inshock, then in awe, and then in fear of the ordinary man with now extraordinary abilities. they feel that george has been altered.in doesn't help when he gets in trouble with the government(the scene where he is interrogated is priceless). <BR>     Then after all this...i will leave you to see the rest. the end of the movie should come as a surprise to you as it was to the characters in the movie and me. john travolta is a good choice for george malley, and his performance carries an insight into his thoughts and feelings. this movie really inspires you to walk out on it, and it remains in your heart for a long time after.
0385474547|4.0|BeforeI began reading 'Thing's Fall Apart' I logged on to websites like Amazon.com and read reviews of the book I had to read for summer reading. I initially thought the the book to be dry and boring but after a couple of chapters I started to really enjoy it and did not want it to end. I can agree with other reviewers who say the book had long words but the dictionary in the end of my book really helped.
B000002AH9|5.0|Real Emotion. Universal Truth. The Sadness and Tragedy of Life. Wilst there is another happy, triumphant, and joyous side to the human condition, all must die, therein lies the tragedy. This is as pure and honest an human expression as you will ever hear anywhere, and for that alone, it is worth its weight in gold. Lady Day, may you rest in peace in the Love of God, and thank you for the many years of singing the blues (jazz). This is a truly moving and worthy musical effort by one of the greatest jazz musicians (voice as an instrument) ever. Buy it, listen to it, and realize that you have been moved by greatness.
0393057658|4.0|This is a great book for anyone who is in anyway interested in any proffesional sports.  It gives great narration through the drafting process and there are many parts in the book that require thinking which is almost always a plus.  With the way it is written, it really places the reader in the situation; great writing.  You don't need to be an A's fan or evena big fan of baseball to enjoy this book.
0788812408|3.0|When reviewing a kids movie I ask myself did I like it enough to watch again.  The answer is yes.  Did the kids watch it repeatedly.  Yes.  But of the five, the youngest (6 yrs old) just watched for the first time this year.<br />It is a nice sweet movie except that the Bad Squid is a little to mean and scared my girls when they were real little.<br />Ultimately the music is only OK and my children now sledom watch it, they have moved on and prefer to watch other films instead.  This is a good kids movie and I recommend it.
B000068IEU|1.0|In response to the last review of this film, I believe you will find that this DVD is about the most uncut version of the film available (note that I specified \\"DVD\\").  The only other version of this film available on DVD ran for a total of 81 minutes in contrast to the 84 of this version.<br />I had to laugh at your review.  You first of all state that this movie is \\"sick\\" and \\"evil,\\" then go on to ask if there is an unrated version of it available!  I also had to laugh at the way you despise the two characters (Radice and Hess) for what they inflicted upon the two young girls, yet give no attention to the fact that they are murdered in equally horrendous ways, which you consider not to be \\"evil\\" or \\"sick.\\"  The bottom line of this is simply the fact that aside from the above, you are being dreadfully over-sighted, as this is purely a film, nothing more.  Wes Craven had hardly any money to make this film with and due to the fact that \\"woodland\\" scenes were filmed in various back yards, the filming crew were regularly being thrown off properties as trespassers by the house owners and had to then re-locate.  When you consider these facts, it is rather easy to see why Wes Craven added the rather jovial atmosphere and scenes to it which nobody of clear judgement and sound mind would ever take seriously!
0783240503|4.0|I wondered if a family oriented movie, Joseph - King of Dreams  that also had a pro religious theme could come out of Dreamworks.  Like wouldn't you be suspicious if the present day Disney management did a pro-religious movie? <br />But, J-KOD the cartoon movie is not bad.  Certainly i think they made a worthy movie.  Only thing is that my kids didn't like it as much as I did.  Given the choice, they preferred Joseph and TATDC starring Donnie based on the long running play.  And they prefer this version, not because Dreamworks dropped the ball, but because the music is just awesome by comparison.<br />Check out the cartoon version by dreamworks as a rental.  then checkout the movie based on the play.
B000002TYK|3.0|Counting out Big Me and For All The Cows, this album is average at best. The ebbing prosody that fetters down the musical horizons of so many people is implicity illustrated by this  lack-luster album. By all means, I'm not trying to truncheon the Foo Fighters, they've made many catchy songs that I like, but this album is really porous. There's nothing to it, yet somehow this catapulted the Foo Fighters into bigtime celebrity status. Tepid rock albums continually abetted by the domineering music industry tend to shape the populace's opinion of good music so beguilingly that the average music fan can't find an alternative to forced satisfaction. Sadly, there are millions of great records that these people will never unearth because of their musical ignorance and unintentional adherence to pop-culture standards. Basically all I'm saying is that people should broaden their horizons and look beyond the mediocre albums, because I guarantee there is much more to be found.
6304539258|5.0|I will never forget the first review for this movie by siskel and Ebert.  Siskel was raving on and on like a kids who's dreams had all just come through.  This was the local broadcast on WGN, not the national one and Ebert was unenthusiastic.  Ebert eventually came around and that little'ol movie that Siskel when nuts over became the greatest movie yet made...  Star Wars.  Then it was renamed Star wars, New Hope.  <br />I  gave all of the first three trilogies 5 stars, because I just can't separate them as my favorite.  There would be no ESB if there wasn't a SWNP.  There would have been no ROJ without ESB.  Each had its great, high tech &quot;run&quot; or chase scene, these being my favorite scenes of each movie.  I now have 3 sons and their favorite scenes are the Lightsaber confrontations.<br />Thanks for all the fun.
B000020617|4.0|There Is Nothing Left To Lose is an impressive outing from a band that in my opinion has always put out good singles, but just average cds. That theory is inverted on this cd. I'm not a big fan of Learn to Fly, but the album as a whole is great. Stacked Actors is an interesting song that can be taken on various different levels. Breakout is a solid rock song. Learn to fly is ok. Gimme Stiches is an another alright rocker. Generator is cool, but still nothing special. Aurora is beautiful, I like this song a lot. Tied with Ain't It The Life for best song. Live-in Skin, certainly not much coming after a song as good as Aurora. Next Year is a fun track. Headwires is fun as well. Ain't It The Life is awesome. Great guitar, just a great song all around. M.I.A. Good Closer. Sure my brief chronicle of each song doesn't sound all that enthusing, but the record as a whole is very good, and Aurora and Ain't It The Life definately make it worthwhile. Give this a whirl, it's the best Foo Fighters cd.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Its funny...people always think Lennon had the sound, but if he hadn't been shot, maybe people would have realized George had the music. Granted, MacCartney was the `pop' force, but listen to Harrison's music, and you will realize he was the best of the post-Beatles era.<br />Compare. Yoko Ono couldn't write a hamburger ad if you ask me. And other than Lennon's Imagine album, his music was avante garde at best. MacCartney was syrupy. Ringo was...well, Ringo.<br /><br />But Harrison...<br />Harrison's All Things Must Pass was the best of any post-Beatle endevour. He didn't just carry the Beatle sound past the break-up, he expanded it.<br />George was so overshadowed. `Taxman' was his only huge hit.<br />My brother traveled with The Who as a photographer in the late `60's-early `70's, and had the opportunity to meet George Harrison backstage (Harrison, Townshend and Clapton were mates, and appeared with each other...). The man never touted his own gifts, or his music. As when he was with the Beatles, he was quiet and soft-spoken. And unfortunately, overlooked. My brother (awestruck) told Harrison he loved his album. Harrison replied \\"It was nice, wasn't it...<br />It wasn't just `nice'. It was incredible.<br />If you thought The Beatles were great, you are missing the boat if you don't have this 3 disc set. It took Harrison's death at the hand of brain cancer for the world to realize his genius.<br />Listen, and enjoy.
B000002BBY|5.0|Setting aside the Gallagher's disconted hubris and absorbing these rich, rock songs for what they are will set forth a stark vision of musical bliss for everyone. Sure Oasis has received lots of criticism for openly emulating the Beatles sound more flagrantly then almost anybody, but who cares? Their songs are still rocking and awesome no matter who they sound like. The hits, Don't Look Back In Anger, Wonderwall, and Champagne Supernova, are all spectacular songs that have garnered condign praise. Those aren't the only good tunes on the disc though. Roll With It, She's Electric and Cast No Shadows are all great songs that could have surrogated the aforementioned three as being the big hits. That's how great this cd is. Six songs that all could be huge hits. Believe the hype. This really is a grand rock album.
B00005JM09|4.0|OK I just came back from viewing T3 and let me say right now all the naysayers should go and crawl back in their holes and await the release of T4 so they can spout their doomsday reviews.<BR>This was an entertaining movie on par with T2 and of course much better than the original because of the SFX. Don't have any reservations about going to see this one but leave your pens and paper at home. Two enthusiastic thumbs up.
0151006903|3.0|I finally staggered to the end of this one after about 200  rounds spread out over four months. I couldn't take more pronlonged sparring. Eco has developed the old &quot;rope a dope&quot; technique into too fine a science. He just stands there in the corner, letting you wail away on him until you've utterly exhausted yourself. By the time the bout was finally over, I realized that all my efforts had been in vain. He was still standing and I was defeated, having expended all that energy for nothing.<br />  There was a time when I came away from an engagement with Eco feeling refreshed and fortified, grateful for the time I had invested in reading works such as NAME OF THE ROSE and FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM. Then came the journey down the literary vortex of torpor, THE ISLAND OF THE DAY BEFORE and now BAUDOLINO, and all I can say is &quot;Oh how the mighty have fallen!&quot;<br />I guess, in all fairness, Eco just raised his personal bar a bit too high with FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM. It is that rare commodity in literature, a hybrid combining pace and great story with enough philosophical digression thrown in to lend it heft.<br />  The problem with Eco's last two books can be traced to one serious defect. The narrators in both books are tiresome; but particularly Baudolino, a pompous, unfunny, self-centered bore. I'm sure that as Eco was modelling him, he had in mind some clever, roguish, humorous figure who just happened to be present at some of the more important historical events in late Byzantine history. The problem is, no literary creation this self-inflated can come across as anything other than someone one would prefer not to be around. He's a lousy reconteur. The stories he tells are generally of the shaggy dog variety. The characters he introduces are uninterseting. His little attempts at moralizing are tedious.<br />  At least you readers who decide to buy this book are luckier than I in one respect. You have the opportunity to buy the paperback version, whereas I shelled out the hardcover bucks, as I was so excited by the notion that this was going to be a return to form for former champion Eco. Unfortunately, it's about like watching Tyson fight these days. He &quot;used to be&quot; a contenda. 3 stars only because reading thrird rate Eco is still better than reading first rate John Grisham.<br />BEKshelled out the hardcover bucks, as I was so excited by the notion that this was going to be a return to form for former champion Eco.

6302990114|4.0|The 1970's were the great decade of \\"all star\\" movies with casts filled with glittering names.  After the success of 1974's \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" it was inevitable that further films based on Agatha Christie's works would follow, of which this was the first.  <br />As \\"Death on the Nile\\" opens, we meet Linnet Ridgeway--young, beautiful, rich, and single--shortly before she meets Simon Doyle, the fiance of her good friend Jackie de Bellefort.  We soon see Simon on honeymoon--with Linnet, not Jackie.  Simon and Linnet board a steamer for a cruise down the Nile, along with several other passengers--including Jackie, who has been tracking the newlyweds on their honeymoon, and who seems to have gone over the edge in her jealousy and anger.<br />Also on board are the famous detective Hercule Poirot, and his old friend Col. Johnny Race of the British Secret Service.  And a good thing, too.  Late one night, Jackie, in a fit of hysteria, shoots and wounds Simon, and is then taken to her cabin and sedated.  The next morning, Linnet is found shot to death in her cabin.  Jackie would be the obvious suspect, but she couldn't possibly have done it.  And so the great Hercule Poirot has another complex case to unravel...<br />\\"Death on the Nile\\" is one of Christie's very best novels, and even with a simplified plot--fans of the novel will not the absence of several characters and at least two sizable subplots--the natural strength of the source material makes for a very enjoyable movie.  It falls short of the very top because of some unsatisfactory casting.  Peter Ustinov is no more than an adequate Poirot, falling short of either Albert Finney or David Suchet.  At times he seems to rely largely on his eavesdropping talents, not his \\"little grey cells.\\"  Nor is David Niven a good choice for Col. Race--he is too dapper and elegant to portray Christie's \\"man of unadvertised comings and goings.\\"<br />However, the supporting cast is quite strong.  Mia Farrow, as Jackie, givesthe standout performance.  Lois Chiles, best remembered today as a Bond Girl, didn't have great range as an actress, but the lovely ex-model had the right personality for the arrogant Linnet.  Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury also stand out.<br />The film won an Oscar for best costumes.  Nino Rota contributed an atmospheric score, and John Guillermin directs ably.  The Egyptian locations--most of the film was shot there--provide a stunning backdrop.<br />On the whole, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It is clearly the best of Peter Ustinov's several outings in the role of Poirot.
B000003S5H|5.0|The first time i heard this record it was played by a roommate of mine before i went to sleep. I never made it beyond song three that time...  This CD is about as mellow and smooth as they come. definately the best CD Air have ever made and definately the best Ambiant/Electronica CD I've heard. This is the most complete CD i own and the only one i can rate as \\"perfect\\".  i must purchase to anyone who wants to get exposed to chillout or to Air.
0671042858|5.0|&quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; doesn't contain blood, gore, specters or other things one might connect to horror, yet it still manages to intimidate.<br />King's best quality is his way of making his characters come to live and his ability to create realistic environments. This book is no exception to that. Trisha's feelings are so strongly expressed, her fate so frightening and her strenght so pure, that it creates goose pimples. When I read the book I said to myself that I would never go in the woods again, of course, that feeling faded, but that's how real and scary the book felt when I read it.<br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is not like King's more typical novels, such as It, Carrie or Christine, but his way of writing is not gone in this book, therefor I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />A good thing about this book is that everybody can read it, regardless if you're a young teenager or an older adult. The only thing I'm not delighted with is the ending. It feels like it was rushed. Except for that, the book's excellent and I'd highly recomment it.
B0000026KQ|5.0|Jeff Beck may not be known to be the most commercially successful artist out there.  He does what he wants; that's clear in this album.  It took me a few listens to get a feel for this album, but it has quickly become a favorite of mine.  \\"Guitar Shop\\" and \\"A Day in the House\\" are the only songs that feature some kind of vocals; therefore, if purely instrumental songs don't appeal to you, then this is not the CD for you.  However, I must say that Beck speaks to us in each and every song through his guitar.  Regarded by many as the best guitar player out there, Beck makes any and every sound possible come from his guitar.  Each song is different, so it's hard to choose a favorite, but \\"Savoy\\" and \\"A Day in the House\\" appeal to me greatly.  <BR>If you like 80's music, but have never listened to Beck before, this is a good place to start.  If your tastes veer from 80's music, then I would begin with some of Beck's earlier stuff.  I can't say that each and every person who listens to Jeff Beck will like him.  His style is unique and most likely you'll love or hate him.  However, if you have an open mind and love listening to excellent guitar work, definitely give this CD a shot.
B000089RVX|5.0|This was a suprisingly good CD. Normally, I enjoy more upbeat and happy music, but the tunes in &quot;Fallen&quot; were too good to resist. The lead singer has a beautiful voice and really shows it off. Some of the better songs were Going Under, Bring Me to Life, My Immortal, Imaginary, and My Last Breath; however, they were all good. I definitely recommend this CD.
0790741520|5.0|Middle-Eastern terrorists hi-jack a commercial airplane headed for Washington D.C. and request that their leader, whom the military had nabbed, be set free. However, the plane has a nerve gas bomb that the terrorists intend to wipe out the east-coast of America with. The governement appoints a group of well-trained soldiers (led by Steven Siegal) to turn off the bomb and take out the terrorists by sneaking in the plane. When tragedy strikes it's up to an inexperienced pilot (Kurt Russell) to lead the team.<br />Though not exactly action-packed, the taut and intense thriller firmly holds your attention until the bullet-riddled finale.<br />If you like this film, I also recommend \\"Air Force One\\" and \\"Die Hard 2\\".<br />Overall rating: 4.8 stars (rounded to 5)<br />Rated R for violence, a suicide bombing, and some language.
B00005O5CM|2.0|This movie was stupid with a capital \\"C.\\"  It reminded me of the afterschool specials without a point. It didn't make me laugh out loud nor did the legal profession get this great boost of Elledom. Thank God I waited until it appeared on cable.  I love Reese, but this movie sucked wind - what was the bunny suit about - oh my gosh I thought it was a costume party. Clueless was so much better than this - legally blond is a poor imitation. Superficial socialite and even dumber trial - this really leads me to believe that blonds do have more fun because had this been any other actress like a younger Sandra Bullock - her career would have been over. Wait a second, scratch that if it had been Nicole Kidman everyone would have been \\"what was she thinking.\\" Reese is such a smart young lady and I feel that this movie made money because of her personality and her cuteness.
B00005JM09|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE. To all those who wroe reviews anticipating a bad third installment of the Terminator series, LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER NOW AND GO SEE IT. Your doubts and forecasts will soon be put to rest. This is an excellent movie which answers almost all questions that anyone would have after watching the previous 2 Terminators. It integrates special effects that not only don't overpower the plot itself, they actually help it. The plot is excellent, special effects are great, and it couldn't have been better from my point of view. It is a definte must see, especially if you saw the previous 2 Terminators and know the story line. A+ Movie!!
034544678X|5.0|I can count the number of nonfiction books I've read on one hand, but I sped through TOEOTL in three days and went back to revisit favorite parts for weeks afterward.  It's helpful for a new dog owner and gives good training advice, but it's just plain fascinating and a page turner as well.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams is my favorite composer and I love all of his music, but Harry Potter takes the cake for what I consider to be some of his best work!!  It's not just that the music is both beautiful and exciting... it's that it so completely captures the essence of the books and the films, it's amazing.  Positively wonderful, and one of my favorite CD's!!
0441009425|3.0|This book was about 200 pages too long. Although the blurb talks about a threat endangering all humanity, I was about 350 pages into the story before any evidence of this threat even began to show. I'd have preferred a bit less \\"epic\\" and a bit more tension. In addition, the three main characters have essentially the same personality. There was very little in their characterization to differentiate them from one another.  I really had to force myself to finish, and the climactic final scene was kind of a let-down. Sorry. I really did want to like this book more.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge! could be one of the best musicals ever made.  It's sad, joyous, exciting, endearing, humorous, and engaging all at once-- there is so much to look at, one viewing is never enough.  The music is positively wonderful and the acting is top-notch.  Hurrah for the return of the musical!
B000000YG5|5.0|Arguably Sonny Rollins' most accomplished musical statement, Saxophone Colossus is certainly the tenor man's most eclectic.  From the carefree musings of &quot;St Thomas&quot; to the smouldering sensuality of &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is&quot;, the album explores a kaleidoscopic array of colors and moods.  If Davis' Kind of Blue merits praise for managing to maintain the same unique mood from start to finish, this disc derives its greatness from its sheer variety--a tribute to Rollins' Caribbean, blues, and bop influences.<BR>Eminently listenable, Saxophone Colossus forms an apt segue for newcomers into the world of jazz.  A fun, approachable album, it works equally well as background music and as serious listening.    It is, finally, a recording that seems appropriate for nearly any time and place, but ultimately one that, in its endless nuances and rewards, refuses to fade into the periphery.  Highly endorsed.
B00005MP58|5.0|P&amp;P from A&amp;E-- beautifully adapted-- fabulous script, glorious acting, beautiful to look at and comforting to watch.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle lead a stellar cast that keeps me watching this DVD set again and again.
B000089RVX|3.0|I liked a lot of what I heard on Bring Me to Life &amp; hoped that the remainder of the CD was more hard-edged than the single that made it on the &quot;pop scene&quot;. Unfortunately that was not the case. Yes, this woman can sing, but I would like to hear more women singers who can really push the envelope &amp; compete in the male-dominated hard rock genre.

If you enjoy a good story, or have an interest in the real-life scandal, then I strongly recommend Quiz Show to you.
0156027321|5.0|As we can never bring the mathematical pi to a rational conclusion, neither can we this remarkable novel.  I read much of it with my little cat on my lap (her flight distance being about a millimeter or less--something you will learn about in the novel).  I suddenly realized she is a distant cousin of the great Bengal tiger of or maybe not of this novel, which I could not stop reading once I had started.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard of maroon5 from my friend jenn, she is really obsessed with them.  I was curious to see how they sounded  so i decided to listen to some songs.  I was blown away by their sound, its such a real band, not like britney spears singing about bubble gum or something.  I was instantly hooked and became a huge fan.  Then me and my friends went to see them live and I was blown away even more (if that is possible.  Lead singer Adam Levine was so intense, passionate, and sexy, not to mention his vocals was INCREDIBLE!! All the guitarist were truly amazing. The drummer is also an amazing singer. Seeing such a good band live is great.  I REALLY recommend seeing them live if you ever get the chance. If you dont, GET THE CD because they are a band that is 10 times better in concert than in studio recording. THE CD IS AMAZING...GO BUY IT NOW!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|THE LED ZEPPELIN DVD is a good 2-disc DVD set. The sound and picture is amazing. I'm amazed cause this stuff was evendentally in the vaults. I'm kind of disapointed cause some of the stuff on the DVD I have seen before, like for example the promo for \\"Communication Breakdown\\" on VH1 Classic but other than that the DVD is great. I think they should re-release \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" with the footage that is on this DVD. I think Moby Dick is the greatest drum solo ever. I enjoyed there covers of \\"C'mon Everybody\\" and \\"Something Else\\". I think the verison of Kashmir they did at Knebworth was fantastic and probley the best. I'm intrested to see more from the Knebworth show. I think they should release a box set full of full shows. If you have this then buy the CD.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is so amazing and it is a shame to have never heard his amazing songs.
B00008OWZC|5.0|LED ZEPPELIN, HOW THE WEST WAS WON is another great live album. I'm not a big fan of live albums cause most of the time they ethier have a bad tracklist or the song doesn't sound good or it sounds like the album track. I like live albums that have a good sound, great tracklist, and if most of the songs sound good like for example the version Immigrant Song here is the best version I've heard, its sightly better than the album version. I hadven't listened to &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; but I saw the tracklist and I was kind of dissapointed cause I know the movie has alot more songs than the album does but the movie is good. The sound quality is good and I say that cause as it says in the liner notes Jimmy Page rediscovered these in the vaults when he was looking for stuff for the Led Zeppelin DVD. Overall this 3 CD set is good buy and I recommend it any Zeppelin and live album fanatics.
B00005JM09|4.0|Like the last reviewer, I had low expectations with this one, I mean after all, when new directors take over a franchise, they usually ignore the last director's ideas & themes, not so here, Jonathan Mostow has for the most part stayed true to Cameron's story arc, In T3, it is 10 years later since T2, & John Connor is now in his 20's & mostly a street person because he still believes that he could be marked again, although the orignal end time has passed, it seems that the military has somehow revived the Skynet funding program, Arnold returns as a new T-800 Cyborg to once again save Connor & a young woman (Claire Danes) who like Connor will play a significent role in the future, he once again has to face off against a new advanced T-X Terminator(Kristanna Loken) who is as every bit as frightening & ice cold as Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2, there are some plot twist, but the twist do explain some things from the last two films, & surprisingly bridges the story very nicely, the ending definately helps explain how Connor came to be this great leader & why the events of the last two films were so important in the order in which they occured, the only thing not explained is how the military got the Skynet infomation to restart its funding, but other than that, this one delivers, & should not disappoint the fans, especially those looking for consistentsy!!!

0385504209|2.0|Okay, I did keep going to the end of the book, propelled by some sort of of desire to see how the whole set of increasingly dubious events would work themselves out.  But I found myself becoming more and more annoyed with the book, and annoyed with the author, who I think greatly disrespects his readers.<br />The so-called &quot;puzzles&quot; which seem to completely flummox the famous cryptographer are ludicrously simple.  It's not much fun to read a &quot;mystery' when the reader is always a few steps ahead of the bumbling protagonists.<br /> There are errors throughout the book which make you wonder if there was an editor - on one page they're going to Lyons, on the next to Lille, isn't Sacre Coeur already north of the Seine? As another reviewer has pointed out anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge  of biblical Hebrew will feel that the author just randomly threw in linguistic references with no regard as to whether they were correct or not.<br />I suspect that one reason the book appeals is that it seems to be revealing a great deal of esoteric knowledge, but I felt that I couldn't depend on ANYTHING the author cared to throw into the book, since the things I did know a little about were generally just wrong.<br />A really satisfying plot might have caused me to overlook the errors, but the plot became increasing more fantasic and  improbable as the book progressed.  - all in all I was left with a feeling of disappointment and a feeling that I had been manipulated.
B00000JHAU|5.0|Belle and Sebastian belong to that rare group of Pop bands who can write AND play well.... without coming off like pretencious wonky PhDs in the process.<br />Almost all of the tracks here display musicianship that deftly layers melody over counter-melody, counter-melody over poly- rhythmic what the... But none of that matters a bit, because every word you hear comes from the heart, not from an existentialist textbook.<br />B & S write aching vignettes too full of ... and vinager to be mistaken for cloying or sentimental fluff, and they carry some very substantial weight. It's not just youthful anger laced in disappointment. These are real people... from the frustrated closet case in \\"Seeing Other People\\", the stymied military man in \\"Me and The Major\\", to the willfully wistful title heorine of \\"Judy and the Dream of Horses.\\"<br />And if the title track reminds you more than a little of Simon and Garfunkel's lighter side circa 1965, it's no accident. Like that other seminal Folk/Pop duo, B & S's strongest asset is their ability to present the truth in a light far more beautiful than it ever deserves.
B00005JM09|5.0|The story is just as good as the other 2, and the special effects, even better.  The liquid metal shots to the chest don't look like cheap plastic like in 2.  Kristanna Loken(TX)is so freaking good looking.  Arnold still one of the best cyborgs ever in science fiction.  The movie is just beyond words in my mind. Go SEE THE MOVIE NOW, AND BE TRAPPED IN THE WORLD OF JOHN CONNOR.
B00008S2VG|4.0|OK, so Madonna's idea of honesty would probably be misconstrued as posing by about 99% of the public.... but does that make this effort any less risk taking... even by her standards?<br />Think about it... aside from \\"Die Another Day\\", these songs run the gamut from spare to minimalist. There is nothing here that screams \\"love me,\\" yet these songs suit Madonna better than any have done before.<br />Not that it's BETTER mind you... she can only take a few guitars, a drum machine, and a morass of synths so far. Using Mirwais's production again following \\"Music\\" may not have been the smartest choice, but obviously it's one that Madonna feels at ease with. And she has to be, in order to empty out some of this material.<br />Sometimes her implicit honesty rewards us, as on \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" which finds her as unpretentious and undefensive as she gets. Other times she clings to embarassing posing or grousing (\\"American Life\\", \\"Hollywood\\") and sometimes it's a mix (\\"Mother and Father\\"). But behind every wooden rap (yes, she makes Debbie Harry circa 1981 sound absolutely funky), there lies some genuine hurt, frustration, and emotion.<br />And from the woman who made a rep on being a plasticized boy toy, that's progress. Nothing on this release is going to stick in your head for years afterward, but almost all the tracks are competant to quite good musically. And if you can look behind the pose, there's more than just vogue going on.
B000000OXH|5.0|With this second album Asia super band made up of progressive masters take the shape of its own. It is less glossy previous progressive form but more into melodic rock, which has been reaching its commercial peak. It became much more closer to American melodic rock masters such as Journey, Survivor, and Foreigner. Don't Cry its first single and The Smile Has Left Your Eyes its second single show their brilliant songwriting and the rest of the tracks are no less excellent. The Last To Know in particular is dynamic yet well-crafted melodic rock masterpiece track and John Wetton's persuasive vocal with brilliant chorus is just what true melodic fans would want. Just a bit of complaint to this version is the sound itself has been a bit murky to do this masterwork justice. Maybe remastering is required.
B00007BK2N|2.0|So you like house music? Love bands who were cornerstones of the genre? Get ecstatic dancing to Joy Division or New Order? Then don't watch this movie.<br />It's difficult to know whether Michael Winterbottom was completely clueless about the real stars of the Manchester indie Pop scene of the late '70s to early '90s, or if he's indirectly mocking it. Whatever way you slice it, he appears to have no idea of how to get a handle on the story or the implicit groove. He's about as hip as Tony Wilson... and actually the real guy is hipper... according to the commentary, even he appears to think the film of dubious quality.<br />As someone states on one of the documentaries that appears in the Special Features section of the DVD, the film has plenty of material for many movies... there are many compelling stories here. So why the hell focus on Wilson's hipster posing? Why concentrate on wit that is so dry and affectless that it's impossible to tell whether he considers bands like JD and NO as anything besides free day-trip tickets to the hair salon or silk paisley ascot money? <br />Winterbottom argues that the Wilson character is more of a tour guide to \\"the scene,\\" which is why we don't get too close to him. And that would be all fine and good if we presented with \\"the scene\\" itself... But most of \\"24 Hour Party People\\" is like an irritating episode of the Tonight Show with a lame guest host and a great musical act that gets bumped at the last minute in favor of the guy who handles snakes.<br />Unbelievably most of the second half of the film is spent on the \\"genius\\" of the Happy Mondays.... with little shrift given to New Order, which are arguably more talented and produced output that is far more influential across any number of musical genres today.<br />But isn't blowing up pigeons and throwing tantrums so much more interesting? Well, no... but it's what these crazy punks are supposed to do, right? Or so Winterbottom thinks... you can almost hear him simpering \\"Am Icool yet?\\" as he directs Wilson to speak soberly on the birth of DJ culture (right to the camera as usual) in his all-knowing monotone.<br />Don't tell us--- show us. <br />When a relatively commercial effort like \\"Go\\" (or an indie treat like \\"Groove\\") can use the rave/dance scene as a backdrop for a story and still convey a sense of the passion and energy the music imparts, it gives you a sense of the power waiting to be tapped into. <br />There's a more positive vibe going on in \\"Thank God It's Friday\\" however. <br />You'd think that a movie that drags itself out over 2 hours and contains the story of some of the most influential music makers and producers in history could manage to least get a foot tapping or a head bobbing. That it doesn't is sheer incompetance and inexcusable.
B000003S09|5.0|...innocense raped with Napalm-fire 21st-century Schizoid Man..<br />This is one of my all-time favorite song-lyrics. If you ever want to know what art-rock is about, go and buy this one. King Crimson never came as close about to the peak of their artistry as with this all-time masterpiece, although all of the following records are a must-have-item for the real King Crimson fan. They were one of those bands who used the mellotron with wit and taste and Greg Lake`s voice never sounded any better. (In my opinion ELP never ever could stand in the shoes of King Crimson). The most outstanding song is 21st Century Schizoid man with its Jazz-rock-oriented feel and extraordinarily crafted song-lyrics which remind us of the social conflicts of the sixties and -of course- the Vietnam war. But one may also like the more esoteric side of the record with songs like Court of the Crimson King which is the `grande finale` of the record. One of those records like the Velvet Underground & Nico or Who`s Next which you take to the island of Robinson Crusoe ... You don`t have to say more ...

B000068VHQ|5.0|What an Beautifully haunting disc by the Cranberris and let me tell you ? the first three tracks will make you an instand fan! such songs as \\"ode to my family\\" , \\" i can't be with you \\" , and, \\" twenty one\\" such amazing  soothing sounds that i just simply zone out and sing along these great tunes ! The rest of the disc gets better and better, with lirycs  that are way to deep and much too sirious...Dolores O'Riordan  should be set apart any other [not good] female vocalist in the music industry... I don't care who she  is! Im starting to hear people say that Christiana aguilera and Dido  are better singers... Well im sorry to break it to them but their wrong because both of those arist can't sing worth jack ! Do your self a favor and save your money and own all of cranberri's work including \\"everybody else is doing it, so why can't we?\\" with that awsome song called \\"Linger\\"  and leave that pop music [stuff] alone! it's all trash !!
B00004TH83|5.0|...This is the best cd in the history of music. I love it more than words. her voice is so rich and powerful. Songs like \\"I Will Love Again\\", \\"Broken Vow\\", and \\"Adagio\\" are true works of art. It helps that David Foster produced this talented woman too! Lara should have been at the top of the charts, but obviously she was not marketed right. Anyone with ears can hear that she has true talent. She is not manufactured talent but, a true artist. This is a great CD! People should stop calling her a Celine follower. She set out to make her own music...but she can replace her anyday!
B000092ZYX|5.0|as a follower of RADIOHEAD for several years, with each album they always end up surprising me in new ways. 'hail to the thief,' however, has been one of the bigger suprises. although, it seems to be a &quot;political&quot; album, with references to george orwell's &lt;u&gt;1984&lt;/u&gt; and the infamous &quot;hail to thief title&quot; (actually dating back to an election about a hundred years ago), it can also been seen in many other different lights. it can mean whatever you want it to mean, not just a an album about whatever title it displays. it is less &quot;comupter blippy,&quot; a depature from the art project 'AMNESIAC.' more musical and intricate. i believe spin magazine had a pretty acutate artical about it in their june issue of 2003. check it out it's worth it. the cd i mean.
B000084T18|5.0|i love this cd i can listen to it forever my favorite song is number three patiently waiting eminem it really good on it of course i love in da club and p.i.m.p number four is another good one the only one i don't like is 21 questions so i would say definitly buy it! it is great!
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore has done it again! This soundtrack for the Two Towers is fantastic! After listening to the soundtrack for the Fellowship of the Ring, I was blown away, and I received the same effect here. It captures the scenes from the movies so well, and it is perfect for Lord of the Ring fans. My favorite tracks include the Riders of Rohan--just the violin theme. My other favorite includes &quot;Evenstar&quot; with a bewitching vocal by Isabel Bayrakdarian, and &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;, &quot;the Hornburg&quot;, etc. The music thoroughly captures the intensity of the film, and listening to it is awe-inspiring. It is truly a masterpiece. The only track I did not like was &quot;Gollum's Song&quot;-- I cannot stand Emiliana Torrini's voice... <BR>Anyhow, this soundtrack is different from the first one, but just as good. It is absolutely a must have.

B00005JKN9|5.0|I really enjoyed THE GANGS OF NEW YORK from beginning to end.  Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job portraying a man who was pretty mean.  It was real departure for him.  I have watched it 4 times since getting it Tuesday.  It was a really great movie.
B000089RVX|5.0|Of all the descriptions I have heard for Evanescence, &quot;Gothic Rock&quot; is probably the best.  When I first heard it, &quot;Goth&quot; is what popped into my mind.  They are very pagan, very troubled.  Amy Lee's voice and lyrics make me want to cry, because I see a little girl lost in a shadow world of fear and sadness.  I've known girls lost in that shadow world before, and they always grab my heart.  If you want to skate across the surface of life with a rockin good tune, buy Blink 182.  If you want to stop and stare into the depths of an ancient lake in the middle of a mystical forest, buy Evanescence.  I love to listen to this just before dawn, on my bicycle, in the fog of a Virginia Beach morning.
B00005JM09|4.0|When I heard that Terminator 3 was coming out last year, I immediately thought to myself 'They're taking it too far.'  When I found out that egotistical Cameron was not doing this film, my expectations were lowered considerably, because T2 was probably one of the greatest films of all time.  But I saw Terminator 3 on opening day, and I must say I was thoroughly impressed.<br />Terminator 3 is exactly what you would expect it to be: a sequel.  Heavy on action, somewhat lighter on plot.  But don't get me wrong...T3 has a great story.  I didn't think they would be able to explain Skynet very well after the end of T2, but they did, and rather nicely I might add. <br />T3 is in no way meant to be better than Terminator 2.  It never can be.  As I mentioned earlier, T2 stands as probably one of the greatest films in the entire history of film making.  But T3 tries very hard to live up to those expectations.  The action scenes in the film are so intense that you'll be clenching your fists and sitting on the edge of your seat.  The effects are very impressive and there are enough explosions and special effects to knock you into next week.  The acting is fairly decent.  The entire cast is new other than Arnold (and another familiar, comical appearence which I won't spoil), and so it leaves a bit of a sour taste in the mouth.  The acting isn't bad, but the characters aren't very recognizable.  Despite this, it is pulled off rather well.<br />I am impressed that the series was picked up by someone other than Cameron.  Given what the director had to work with, he did a very good job.  However, there are terribly glaring mistakes in this film which throw off the timeline of the entire movie.  It is clear that the director did not consult the previous films whatsoever for research.  The film indicates that John Connor was 13 years old during the events of Terminator 2, but he was actually only 10 years old.  Were he to be 13 years old, Terminator 2 would have taken place in 1997,which means that the rest of the events mentioned in T2 and the events in T3 would be completely thrown off track.  This is an easy error to fix when they transfer it to DVD, but it is an obvious and glaring mistake to Terminator fans (it takes the quality of the movie down an entire star).<br />That's the only real gripe with the film.  Otherwise, the story is done quite well.  There are twists in this film that are just completely unexpected and add to the quality of the story.  The ending is also very memorable...one of the best and most unexpected endings I've seen in a film in a long, long time.  This film is also alot more comical than previous films.  In Terminator 2 the humor was subtle and light, where in this film it is blatantly obvious, which is good as it releives alot of the tension that the film creates.<br />Here's a tip if you plan to see this movie: it is absolutely unfair to compare this movie to Terminator 2.  It is a different movie.  Terminator 2 was very emotional, very dramatic, and very intense with its delivery.  Terminator 3 is in-your-face action.  The great bulk of the Terminator story was told in Terminator and Terminator 2.  Terminator 3 could be considered the climax...the plot is very good, but it doesn't need as much explanation, since that was taken care of in the previous 2 movies.<br />I went into this movie expecting a flop, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  T3 is a solid film that will keep you interested in its story and on the edge of your seat with its effects.  Go to this movie expecting a good film.  Don't expect another T2.  As long as you follow that criteria you will enjoy this film.  T3 was definitely a great addition to the Terminator series, even if the director just blatantly disregarded the chronology of the previous 2 films.  I try not to notice that, but its too obvious.<br />And on a final note: T-X has nothing on the T-1000.  She may be tough, but the T-1000 was slick and clever.  I missed the T-1000 alot in this film.
B00005JM09|3.0|...and what's this \\"comedian Terminator\\" [stuff] about?  Arnold is throwin' one-liners left and right!  A LITTLE comedy is okay, but come on, this is Terminator! This movie is basically the second installment in the series, except worse.   I didn't TOTALLY hate the movie, but it isn't all that great.  John Connor is now 18, and the Revolution of the machines against the humans is about to begin.  A new Terminator model called the T-X or Terminatrix, is sent from the future to kill him and an older model, the T-800, (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect him...same as the second one.  There is a hint at the end of the movie that there will be a fourth one.  Anyway, see it, but don't expect it to be an extrordinary scifi action film like the others were.
B00005JM09|3.0|I saw the film being a big fan of the original two.  While the action scenes were very good, the storyline and plot were very weak and not up to the rest of the trilogy in my opinion.  The characters were left undeveloped and while the story had so much potential, it ultimately let down by not exploring the many possibilities.  Essentially it ended up feeling like a Saturday Night Live parody skit, rather than the real deal.

I have seen the movie and I can tell you that if you are a fan of the earlier movies you will not be dissapointed. There is plenty of action, and Arnold is in top form. This movie also sets up a possible T-4. Reviwers be damned, this is a worthy sequel to the other Terminator movie.

B00005JM09|4.0|TERMINATOR 3 is a well-crafted film that continues the present and future history of the war between humanity and the machines that scientists thought would enhance the security of human beings. The first entry was done straight with the focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger as the unstoppable killing machine sent back to 1984 to kill the mother of the future leader of human resistance.  The sequel shifted gears to emphasize the then state of the art special effects that nevertheless took a back seat both to the fine acting of Linda Hamilton and to an unexpectedly softer side of an Arnold who could add resonance to a character that did not dominate dramatically as it did in the original.  But by this newest entry, Director David Mostow leans more to the second for dramatic inspiration and acknowledges the first mostly in humorous allusions.  The evil Terminatrix, played expressionless by Kristanna Loken, is no more than an eye candy reincarnation of the role first played by Robert Patrick, who nevertheless, managed to invest his character with purpose and some unexpected humor.  Miss Loken says little and emotes less.  One could argue that a cybernetic killing machine truly ought to carry out its function with emotionless purpose, yet both Patrick and Schwarzeneggar were killing machines that were fun to watch. The lack of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor forced Director Mostow to rely on the secondary characters to maintain interest.  Arnold, of course, did his bit.  Even at 55, he still looks big and menacing enough to be convincing.  Further, his often overlooked comic side appears frequently enough to invest his character with flair and audience identification.  Nick Stahl as John Connor and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster try hard to duplicate the mother-son chemistry that worked so well with Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton of T2.  But in this case, their characters seem to have been developed on the fly. They meet, they argue, they fight first each other then the Terminatrix; then they are told they will fall in love.  Throughout most of the film, they seem uncomfortable in their scenes together.  <br />Characterization was clearly not the intent of T3.  This film was chock full of an incredible number of car crashes, truck runaways, explosions, and body morphing.  There were the usual number of retreads from the first T film, including numerous variations on 'I'll be back' to the reappearance of the police psychiatrist who mumbles on about how this newest feminine killing machine could no more be real than the Arnold whose cybernautic traits were obvious to everyone except himself.  There were a few logical flaws too. Why would the United States have created the prototype of the silver-skinned terminators and have so conveniently stacked them under plastic so they could be used against humanity?  Further, you would think that the originators of Skynet would have seen THE FORBIN PROJECT and have deduced that it would be unwise to turn over computer control of this country to a self-aware mechanical intelligence.  Still, the strong points of T3 outweigh its shortcomings.  What I liked was the careful working out of a future history that, in whose present terrors, overlaps a time that is right here on our doorsteps.  The closing scenes hint that there will be a T4 film, that may not include an aging Arnold.  For this proposed next film, I suggest a more emotional and hence more believable android protagonist who can continually remind us that greatness in a hero is measured mostly by greatness in the villain.
1572522828|1.0|Shame on Fox Lorber for sucking the blood out of this movie with their editing of the film's sexiest scenes. Don't bother buying this movie, and keep this in mind when considering buying others of their film reissues.
0783225970|4.0|Al Pacino is brilliant in this film.  I love Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as she lights up the movie with her smile.  Michelle Pfeifer is awesome in her performance.  It's definitely not the Paul Muni movie from way back.  If you watch this film, make sure its the unrated version.  It is absolutely &quot;Brutal&quot;!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Yes, I love radiohead as I would guess many many people do. And I've read much discontent about Amnesiac and Kid A but apparent approval of Hail to the Thief as a move toward Radiohead's progressive rock album OK Computer. Well I can definitely say it IS! Much more guitar which definitely is pleasing to listen. But if you pay attention to Radiohead, you'd know WHY the last two albums weren't like OK Computer. Because it was such an overwhelming success. You'd soon see wannabe-Radiohead bands everywhere. I don't know about you but to see this \\"genre\\" completely defiled to the works of bands like Newfound Glory, Blink 182, or even dare I say Metallica.... no, rock is pretty dead. If you can't appreciate the musical level of Radiohead's genius and their talent in creating totally captivating musical pieces then i'm sorry you can't. If you like Radiohead, you won't be disappointed with this album. It's a Radiohead album for god's sake. I'm never disappointed...
6304696566|5.0|This was John Wayne's finest performance of his career and John Ford's most breathtaking with it's beautiful cinematography.  Wayne's role as Ethan Edwards was the finest work of his career.  Ford's visual beauty and social theme (racism and prejudice) in the movie was revolutionary for it's time.  This is a masterpiece in filmmaking!
0783225792|4.0|Another classic Scorsese production.  Round up the usual suspects on this one.  Sharon Stone was the best thing in this movie and she definitely deserves her Oscar nomination on this performance.  The only problem I have with the movie was I thought Joe Pesci was still playing the character in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.  It still shines, though.
0792101448|4.0|Up until this movie, Henry Ford was relegated to playing All-American good guys.  It would all change with this performance, which I found to be one of his better roles.  One of the better westerns.
B00004XPPB|3.0|Though Al Pacino gives a solid performance, I found the film to be blasse.  It's plot was slow and teedious.  The movie does have its tension filled moments.  However, I found this movie to be a poor man's &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.
0060278250|3.0|Sabriel and Lirael are two books that I will never forget - for all it's intricacy and brilliance. After reading an amazing first and second book, I had expected Abhorsen to be more complex and intensifying than the first two books. I was slightly disappointed at what was meant to be a grand finale. I would like to think that my expectations of Abhorsen were far too high, but Sabriel and Lirael were much more complex in terms of storyline. I guess one thing that could be improved would be more Dead 'species'. It does get a bit repetitive with similar Dead creatures appearing in every chapter - if not the appearance of Gore Crows, it would be Dead Hands or Shadow Hands. One of the high points of this book's storyline for me was the revelation of who Mogget and the Disreputable Dog really were. The defeat of Orannis is, of course, interesting. Although I would have liked Abhorsen to be more electrifying and convincing, I still will recommend this series to intermediate readers for all its great writing. To end on a higher note, this trilogy is definitely NOT to be missed, mainly due to its great fantasy ideas and plotline. I congratulate Garth Nix for this fantastic fantasy series.
B0000024T3|3.0|I have every album she has ever released and although this is certainly not one of my favorite, I do adore the song 'Autumn Leaves'. It is my all-time favorite Barbra song! (And that's a very tough call.) It is haunting and subtle (subtle is not how I would describe most of this album). It never fails to send chills down my spine. Whenever I want to re-introduce someone to her incredible 'VOICE'  I play this selection.
B00005JM09|4.0|It's rare for a sequal to be comprable to it's predecessor, but this movie did it!  While the special effects seemed to be more reminiscient of T1, the intesity level for this movie was still quite high. T3 also had many great tie-ins to the other two movies, lines and effects that Terminator fans should catch on to to help make this movie even more enjoyable.  Unlike the other two Terminator movies, this one also had an element of humor brought into it which helped diffuse some of it's intensity.  And the casting was great.  The ability to act through facial and physical expressions (or the lack there of, as in the case of the Terminatrix) in addition to their spoken lines was impressive.  The reason I withheld a star dealt with the story.  It raised some questions that didn't get answered but that would hopefully be answered with a possible T4.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air! I always knew Beyonce is by the far one of the great voices of the decade, now I am sure of it. \\"Dangerously In Love\\" is not just another album for the shelf, this is the album of the year! Not only is Beyonce an intense vocalist and prolific songwriter, she is a timeless musical gem! Thank God for you! All the songs are exceptional, but my favorite is \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" simply because of some issues I'm going through. I can really relate to the lyrics.<br />1) Crazy In Love - The first single, intense beats and catchy lyrics feat. Jay-Z fitting for the impact this album will have on popular music!<BR>2) Naughty Girl - Another great dance track, samples the ever-popular \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" hook. I really LOVE this song!<BR>3) Baby Boy - If two dance hits weren't enough, another Reggae-Arabic influenced track starring Sean Paul. Great track!<BR>4) Hip Hop Star - Yet another fresh dance track with the coolest beats! Beyonce really rocks this one! Beyonce is just one cool foxy lady!<BR>5) Be With You - I really love this track! The 'ballad label' simply does it no justice. You can easily hear Beyonce's musical influences on this track. This is more like a slow jam. You can dance to this nice beat!  One of my favorites!<BR>6) Me, Myself and I - This is another great slow jam. Great lyrics - \\"All the ladies if you feel me\\" - \\"From now on I'm gonna be my own best friend\\" - I really LOVE this!<BR>7) Yes - The beats on this track are far from the traditional ballad. This album is taking the traditional to a new level. This track has raw, creative lyrics. \\"The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes\\" - I applaud Beyonce for this one!<BR>8) Signs - This is another favorite of mine! It's a fun, groovy track. Missy Elliot makes a cameo on this one. It's one of my \\"repeat\\" tracks!<BR>9) Speechless - Let me start with - I LOVE THIS SONG!!! A beautiful song with equally beautiful lyrics. Beyonce's vocals on this track leave me \\"Speechless!\\" She is able to take you right along with her - \\"SENSATIONAL!\\" This is an emotionally-driven \\"anthem\\" of love-making. 100 stars!<BR>10) That's How I Like - This is a sweet dance track feat. Jay-Z. Sure to please all new couples! Really great!<BR>11) The Closer I Get to You - This is a very beautiful ballad with Luther Vandross. Sone might say it doesn't fit the general feel of the album, but I think it was impressively performed nevertheless.<BR>12) Dangerously In Love 2 - A remix of this great hit! We can fall in love with it all over again. Great choice for the album title too!<BR>13 Beyonce Interlude - A poem from Beyonce. What can't you do girl? Really nice.<BR>14 Gift from Virgo - Another beautiful ballad dedicated to her new love. Honest lyrics, \\"I just wanna be with you\\" - \\"I never ever wanna say goodbye\\" - \\"One day we'll make love finally.\\" Thanks for such a priceless musical gift Beyonce.<BR>15 (BONUS) Daddy - Touching, sweet, sincere song dedicated to her Daddy. \\"I want my unborn son to be like my Daddy\\" - \\"I thank you for loving me.\\" I really LOVE this!<br />Beyonce - Congrats on this album! I strongly recommend it to everyone!
B00006J3WH|5.0|This soundtrack is for any Buffy fan who has been following this show and loved the musical.  I was supremely happy when this came out and bought it right away.  I recommend that you buy it as well.  The music is a great example of Joss's talent and wit.  You won't regret this purchase.
0688163173|5.0|For the first two thirds, this is a way above average suspense mystery.  Then there's a twist that you won't see coming, but it's so perfect you feel like you should have.  Finally, when you're getting used to looking at everything in a new way, there's a last page ending that's heartbreaking, but also just right.  Robert Cormier's &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; is the only time I've seen something like this pulled off.  Reading it the second time through, knowing what's coming, should be fascinating.  Even without all this brilliant plotting, the characterizations are enough to keep you interested.  Also, I highly recommend the booktape version published by HarperCollins.
B00005221M|5.0|I bought this DVD when it initially came out in DTS and it is still the pride of my collection.  The plot, acting, sound, and in particular the cinematography are all stunning.<br />It is also significant in that it is one of the few movies available which lends an insight into pre-Revolutionary War American history (based on the Fenimore Cooper novel of the same name).  The sense of growing indignance of the settlers who occupied the area east of the Appalachians over the attitude of their English masters (which shortly afterwards fermented into all-out rebellion) is portrayed adeptly by Mann, who scripted as well as directed the film.<br />Wes Studi is powerful and menacing as Magua, and Jodhi May puts in an understated performance as Alice (who benefitted from having the most poignant scene in the movie).  But it is Daniel Day-Lewis as the confident (if arrogant - but then since he always turns out to be right, he can be) Hawkeye who dominates -even the gorgeous scenery, which would have otherwise been a scene-stealer.  Talk about a brilliant piece of casting.  A terrific actor - and with his good looks and an open shirt pure sex appeal - Day has real screen presence.  The only flaw as far as I am concerned is the casting of Madeleine Stowe in the role of Cora.  Yes, she is beautiful, but she couldn't quite get to grips with an English (or Scottish, as the case may be) accent and simply wasn't at all convincing in the role.  Perhaps the blame doesn't lie solely with the casting director or Stowe - the Cora character is not very well written, a prim snob one minute, an uninhibited wild woman the next.  Oh, well, I guess even proper ladies eventually succumb to basic animal magnetism.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|So what if they do not write their own lyrics.  There are a lot of artists who don't.  Besides I would rather have someone who knows how to write lyrics then some artist trying to write lyrics.  The beats of these songs are great.  And just because some of their songs didn't make it big in America on the radio doesn't mean anything.  It is Euro Pop.  Not American Pop.  I wouldn't expect Euro Pop to make it very big in America.  All the songs on this album are very good.  I give it five stars.
B00005JM09|4.0|THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS T2 BUT A GREAT ACTION FILM. Critics of this film are unfairly penalizing it because it is was not directed by James Cameron, is missing Linda Hamilton, and is not as great as T2. However, there were two choices - either end the series after T2, which certainly would have been understandable and in many ways seemed to be implied by the satisfyingly seeming finality of that film, or adapt to the current realities and produce a sequel. I am very glad that they chose to produce this sequel, I enjoyed it tremendously and think Jonathan Mostow did a very credible job as the director given the constraints of the story as developed in the first two films.<br />Of course, while the film stands alone as an action adventure story, any viewer who has not seen the two earlier Terminator films will not be able to put either the events in this film or the criticism of it in the proper context. No lengthy descrition of the storyline is necessary - John Conner (Nick Stahl) has remained on the run and seemingly invisible since T2 (just in case another Terminator tries to hunt him down). Also, it turns out that the Skynet project has not been permanently derailed, but only temporarily delayed. Suddenly, the timelines of these two elements of the film intersect. An advanced TX-model Terminator (Kristanna Loken) arrives to eliminate John and his friends who will comprise the Resistance Movement in the future. Meanwhile, the Skynet project is moving toward activation. Very conveniently (one of the weak spots of the script), the TX locates John while searching for his HS friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) after John has unknowingly broken into the veterinary hospital where Kate works. And then, just to make sure that the plot is easy to understand and the movie can concentrate on the action, Kate's father happens to be the general in charge of the Skynet project. As the entire moviegoing populace is aware, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as an \\"obsolete\\" T-101 model that has been sent to protect John and replace the model that liquidated itself in T2,<br />So, the battle is joined. Arnie looks great for a 55 year old, the three hour a day exercise regimen makes him virtually indistinguishable from the version of twelve years ago. The new TX model has better tools than the version in T2, and while Loken has been critized for her impassive performance, it is one of the great aspects of the film - she is supposed to be a machine. The action scenes are very long but never boring, although they may go over the top in a few instances. The general tenor of the film is very reminiscent of T2, and several of the sequences closely reprise similar aspects of that film.<br />This film is less satisfying than the earlier films in three respects. First, there is nothing radically new and different, either with regard to the technology or the story, Second, Arnie's one liners are not as memorable and the repatee in general not as consistently clever. Third, the ending is relatively downbeat and is only satisfactory if there is a sequel, it does not stand on its own. So don't expect the near perfection and leading edge quality of T2, but this is nevertheless a very good story.<br /> While I was initially disappointed by the ending, upon reflection I realized that it was the only conclusion which made sense. As the title states, this movie is about THE RISE OF THE MACHINES. As we await the hoped for sequel, we are left to ponder one of the recurrent questions asked by great science fiction -  whether history can be truly rewritten and fate changed by future events or whether the truly major events in human history are largely foreordained and any attempts to alter them doomed to failure.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This CD is great.  All these songs I can listen to over and over again.  Some of the lyrics are shallow but most of them are very deep and make you think.  My favorite songs on this CD are Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, and Mother &amp; Father.  In the song Nothing Fails there is a church chior which really adds to the music.  This CD is well worth the money.  I hope Madonna keeps releasing CDs like this one!

630469878X|5.0|Thelma and Louise is a brilliant classic movie that everyone should see to form their own opinion. The scenery is stunning, especially in the Grand Canyon. This is the best acting I have ever seen Geena Davis do and it is the first time I have seen Susan Sarandon in a far from patronising role. The two actresses seem to be 'made for this role' and the story is all too believable. I was never bored for a moment and for men and women Geena and Brad Pitt and Susan look pretty good. They do things we would all like to do and relieve us of the responsibility. I also enjoyed the soundtrack so much I am getting a copy to play in the car to remind me of it. The dvd sounds good on my home cinema. It is also interesting to see an American policeman portrayed as an unbiased sympathetic human being for once. Even though most people know the ending it is still well done and in my opinion well worth watching.<BR>This is one DVD that I will not be passing on or getting rid of.
0783228007|2.0|Clint Eastwood rarely stars in a bad movie, but that's not to say this is bad, it just falls a bit flat. A good cast, including a deliciously villainous Robert Duvall unfortunately fail to lift this picture above mediocrity. Add to this, it's relatively short running time (just under 90 minutes), fans of the genre, and Clint (who have been spoiled by great movies before) will feel a little let down. It's probably fair to say that a lesser known cast, and director wouldn't even have got this movie off the cutting room floor. All this said, any Clint collector will probably want it in his/her collection, and the usual amount of dry humor, and Eastwoodesque rationality does make this watchable, if not that memorable.
0780631684|1.0|Final Destination is a super natural thriller about well death,so how could it be so bad,let me count the ways. First off the movie starts out with a plane like we have never seen one of those turn on the news. Next the movie drags slowly with kids that decided to get off the plane get questioned which drags on too long. Finally some dies by falling in the tub from water seeping under a toilet(this scene could have been so good,but instead its got a supernatural feel to it)and next more deaths continue kinda of boring a guy on a bus gets hit,like we have never seen that either. Lastly at least the movie could have some sex appeal to make up for the slowness but the movie fails again Ali Larter looks like a poodle,I don't understand in Varsity Blues she looks pretty darn good but in this I didn't even recognize her. HOPEFULLY FINAL DESTINATION 2 WILL MAKE UP FOR MY LOST TIME WITH THE FIRST ONE
0930289234|5.0|I'm not going to explain the intricate details of Watchmen but I will sum up my thoughts simply by saying that this is a *must*. Whether someone is into comics or not, this book is simply amazing. It is philosophical, tragic, romantic, depressing, humorous, enlightening, and mysterious..to say the least.<br />To be honest, I had my doubts about it because of the appearingly aged 1985 comic art and because of how some events came together, but when you finished reading a chapter, everything became somewhat clear.<br />When I closed this book, my brain just sent a loud &quot;WOW&quot; through my body. Whether you are into comics are not, get this. Immediately. Watchmen was an experience that I wish came more often in comics.
B000002I2G|4.0|In my book the Doors could do little wrong.  Whereas The Soft Parade is probably the second worst of the Jim Morrison Doors recordings, it still is loaded with quality material.<br />Touch Me and Wishful Sinful are two softer tunes that greatly combine the lush horns and strings with Jim Morrison's passionate vocals.  Love the saxaphone solo on Touch Me and the ending where Jim chants Stronger Than Dirt!!!!<br />The title track is truly a keeper on this record.  The many changes in rhythm on this one make it a true keeper.  Wild Child and Shaman's Blues are true stunning examples of the old school Doors where Ray Manazrek's organ takes me to a special place.<br />Runnin' Blue is a little bit hokey but certainly not a bad songs by any means.  Do It is an average track. But the Doors average music would blow away great material by such mediocre bands like Foriegner and Survivor.<br />Again, not quite on the level of LA Woman, The Doors, or Morrison Hotel but close enough to where it belongs in your collection.
0736041850|5.0|The reason I say this is a helpful workout aide is because I had a serious problem incorporating intensity into my exercises. I just want into them as much as others were. After I got this book, I checked the exercises that I lacked lifting intensity in, and my problem was gone. By knowing what area I was primarily working, and focusing on them, imagining them in a red color (as in this book), I was able to finish a workout proud of myself, knowing I put as much intensity into it as I could. The art is stunning. Personally, I believe that it is a must-have book for anyone into weight trainers, but hey, all the other reviews say so too. Experience it yourself.
B0000060NF|4.0|The many reviews on this CD seem to hail this work as a classic.  I am listening to this CD with an open mind.  There are some touching lyrics that talk about all the struggles in the world.  Marvin wants to Save The Children and thats an admiring quality.<br />However, I have mixed feelings musically about this record.  Whereas there are some nice instrumental touches particularly around the percussion, flute, and strings, the rhythms vary ever so slightly.  It seems as if all nine songs utilize similar chord sequences and stylings.  What's Happening Brother is a nice song but it is way too similar to What's Going On.  Flying High In The Friendly Skies is barely different from What's Happening Brother.  A little slower yes, a little bit more atmospherics yes, but almost the same song.  Whereas the song blends are a little creative somehow I would have liked a little more of a change of pace.<br />Nonetheless, I respect the message that Marvin tries to send in his music.  And I really like Inner City Blues(Makes Me Wanna Holler) a great deal.  Three and a half stars seems about right but since I'm in a good mood I'll round it up to a four!
0385504209|2.0|This has got to be a record number of theories that can packed into one story.  I have never read such a disjointed, mishmash of unresearched untruths in my entire life...The Georgia O'Keefe and Disney tie-ins were pretty absurd to say the least.  Why do people eat this ...up?  I am going to ask for my money back.
B000068IEU|4.0|This is a film with some history!  Over here in England the film was banned outright for many years and has only recently been released on DVD with a bunch of cuts made by the censor.  The version of the film on this US (region 1) DVD is as close to Wes Craven's original cut as is possible.  The extras on the DVD include previously unreleased footage from the film, much of which is silent due to the sound recording having been lost, a documentary about the making of the film, and a few bits and pieces of interviews and so on.  To be honest you probably won't watch the extras more than once, they are OK but not worth the price of admission on their own.<br />The real draw is the film.  There are two versions included, identical in content, but in different aspect ratios.  On one side an anamorphic widescreen version, and on the other a regular version for viewers with non-widescreen TV's.  The plot is an old one, and serves as a good reminder to be careful around strangers, especially when they are scary psychopaths who are on the run from the law!  <br />The film was shot in the early 1970's so the clothes, cars and props appear quite dated, a bit like watching old re-runs of TV shows, and the special effects have a bit of a dated look to them too.  That said, this doesn't really detract from the basic punch of the film which goes right for the breadbasket.  <br />What is surprising is that the film stirred up so much publicity and outrage when it was originally released but does not seem to arouse the same amount of hostility and emotion now.  The film WAS shocking in the early 1970s.  For some people it still will be.  But for many of us now the film will not shock or outrage at all.  Perhaps the film contains a hidden lesson, what shocks now will be tomorrow's everyday fare, and that's kinda scary.<br />Buy this film because it is entertaining and shocking. It may not have the latest special effects, it may not have the most gore, but the film does make you think, and that's worth your money.
B0000057C5|4.0|First off, Rammstein, as good as they are, aren't as cool as In Extremo.  Check those guys out!  In any matter, Sehnsucht is excellent!  I love the title track, as well as Bestrafe Mich and Buck Dich (yes, I know, the umlauts are missing). I even went as far as to translate some of the songs myself so that I could understand them.... and sing along better(;  Even if you can't speak German, you find yourself trying to sing along with the songs.  The CD is definitely powerful.  By the way, \\"Du hast\\" does NOT mean \\"you hate\\", that would be \\"Du hasst\\".  \\"Du hast\\" means \\"you have\\".  If you see a translation that says \\"you hate\\", you can be sure it's wrong.  For accurate translations, check out [the website.]
B00005JM09|4.0|The trailer was quite disappointing, and I thought there were nothing new in the plot. I accepted I was wrong. The movie came out  better than I thought. A lot of questions in T2 were answered, but they still left themselves room to make T4. Don't expect too much from the new special effects. Anyway that was offset by the nonstop action from the begining till the end--I felt the same way as when I watched \\"the Speed.\\" Arnold's tradmark humour was still evident in the movie. All the new faces did their job pretty impressively. If you don't compare T3 with T2, I'm sure you will love this movie!

B00008H2LB|3.0|My 2 words to define the music these guys put out! Not an outstanding album I believe, but still with Linkin Park's trademark I enjoy well spread. \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is one of the best songs I've heard lately, \\"Easier to Run\\" and \\"From the Inside\\" are my other favorite tracks.  Enter the Park and find a new dimension of music.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I loved the movie Chicago and believe it earned every award it received.  The acting was superb, as was the music.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released.  Chicago is a far better movie than Moulin Rouge in my opinion.  I lasted about five minutes with Moulin Rouge and turned it off.
B00008G9JO|1.0|Were we really here convening a meeting of the Jethro Tull Fan Club, then I suppose it would be enough that the moniker &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; appears on Heavy Horse's sleeve.<br />We are not, and it isn't. I don't begrudge the members of the Jethro Tull Fan Club their fixation, but in the wider world Heavy Horses must, I'm afraid, survive by such merits it may possess.<br />Were it really &quot;nitpicking&quot; to point out that Heavy Horse's lyrics are awful, its music non-existent, then I suppose we should have to content ourselves to consider how the various instrumentalists acquit themselves. It is not the fault of these hired hands that the rigid structures (I almost said &quot;strictures&quot;) we find here give them little opportunity to shine. They do as well as we can reasonably expect given the circumstances, but if we had Steve Gadd on drums, Eddie Gomez on bass, Larry Carlton on guitar, it wouldn't make a bit of difference. (If you want musicianship, pick up a Steely Dan.) <br />Oh, never mind: the armless, legless knight from &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; will bluster on.
0446677450|3.0|Before all you people out there begin to bash me giving me for not giving this full stars let me tell you something - I do like Robert Kiyosaki. He is one of the people who has had an impact for changing my life for the better (but not much), and I do commend him on his good hearted nature in helping teach the poor and the middle class financial literacy.<br />For example, I like the book Rich Dad's Prophecy which he wrote concerning the possible stock market crash in 2016. It's good. In fact I have to say that its one of his best books because in order for the government to carry out its plan of social security reform the public needs to be educated about the issue. So I like what he's trying to do and I can't say I haven't learned anything from reading his books.<br />So what's the pitfall?. <br />In my opinion this book (as well as most his others) fall short due to a shortage of information as well as lack of credibility on Kiyosaki's part.<br />I'll address information issue first.<br />Kiyosaki recommends that the average individual should try and become wealthy through real estate and through building a business. He's says that you should have money work for you and not the other way around. Sure, I like that idea. I certainly don't want to work for the rest of my life!. Working for money that is...<br />But he doesn't ever tell people the cons of the solutions to which he is recommending. Things like real estate, small businesses and network marketing buisnesses are all filled with con men, sue me sharks and numerous pitfalls that can eat a person alive. Sure, a lot of other fields have these too but more so in these industries than any other, simply because they are easiest to which an average person can enter. In reality, it takes a lot of other skills to succeed in todays fast paced business world- skills that aren't found in a book and without the right experience.<br /> It concerns me that he makes his solutions seem so easily simple when in reality they really aren't. The reader is motivated through out the whole wihtout much knowledge of what to do at the end. Coming from the business sector I can say that setting a bunch of novices loose on any market segement is not too intelligent to any business.   There are a lot better books out there when it comes to building a buisness for example, that people simply just don't read.<br />Not only that, it also bothers me to find talented men and women who have great gifts for their professions abandon them which in order to seek security ala real estate, MLM, etc. I'm not necessarily talking about the overworked doctor or the underpaid waitress, I'm talking about those would be comic book artists, dancers and athletes who I personally know who have a gift but choose to give up their passions for the sake of security. Yes, it's nice to seek security too but at the end of your life what is it that you really want to be known for?.<br />I know that a lot of creative fields are very competitive but instead of gaining confidence in their ability by learning how to strengthen their talents and gaining experience  they are abandoning their ambitions all together and seek security only. That to me is sad. It's called planning for failure. Many have told me they will pursue their careers once they are financially independent but life has no guarantees - already one of them passed away and he was on the \\"safe\\" route.<br />There's also the credibility issue with Kiyosaki.<br />Let's say for example that Rich Dad was still alive and a reporter found out who he was. The world now knows who he is. Would you rather listen to Rich Dad from now on or Kiyosaki? I think you would listen to Rich Dad (who ever he was) because he taught Kiyosaki everything right? If that happened Kiyosaki would go broke in a flash. No one would ever want to listen to him when they could listen to his teacher. Therefore Kiysoaki won't tell the world who Rich Dad is. He can't afford to. I also suspect that there MIGHT not ever have been a Rich Dad. Certainly Kyosaki's childhood friends could give clues as to who Mike was and his brothers and sisters would certainly know something as well. Both Kiyosaki's parents passed away but they would probably know the truth as to whether or not there really was a rich dad. If Kiyosaki's kin does not know, they either swore an oath of secrecy or there may not have been a Rich Dad at all.<br />Who is Kiyosaki anyway?. Not much if at all, is really known about him. His book made him popular but scary as it is (if you think about it) there is not much to know other than what he TELLS US we should know. He is known as an educator, investor and businessman but many a news articles and investiagtions have turned up empty in finding accomplishments to back up Kiyosaki other than his Rich Dad business. I'm talking before and after the success of his book.  For example, if you were to find a person to teach you how to play basketball. Would you rather ask Michael Jordan or someone who has just wrote a book about it. There are plenty of great books on basketball but chances are you would pick Jordan because of all the championships he's won. Similar with Kiyosaki, there isn't a lot accomplishment to back up who he stands for.I can certainly tell you that Michael Jordan is worth $408 million from Forbes recent figures but no one knows what Kiyosaki's worth is, not even Forbes. And if they can't find out there's a problem. <br />Another thing that takes credibility away from Kiyosaki is that most of his advice is not his own. Most of it is common sense. In Rich Dad's Prophecy, there are a lot of references to articles concerning depleted 401Ks and Social Security reform. It's not hard. Just go on the internet and you will easily find literature available on the subject. What's more interesting to me, is that there are quite a few economists who offer ideas on how to solve the issue that quite drastically differ from Kiyosaki's typical real estate and small business approach. Kiyosaki just rehashes most (not all) of what they say before going back to the 6 basic lessons in the first book. <br />I have no problem with repetition but people buy his books to find answers to questions risen from past books.It's a never ending cycle.<br />To summarize, I do think Rich Dad Poor Dad ( as well as his others) is a good starter book, though I believe it would be wise to check out some of the facts before you implement any of his recommendations. I wish you well in all future endeavors. Thanks.<br />SW
B000002UC5|1.0|A number of reviewers have complained that this appears to have been  thrown together quickly. Of course it was, and from Paul McCartney's point of view it desperately needed to be. <br /> John Lennon had quit the Beatles;  the Beatles had thus decided to dissolve; and the Beatles and members of their entourage had agreed to keep quiet about this until the last Beatles album \\"Let it Be\\" had had a chance to run its course, assuming the news might otherwise hurt its sales. If Paul McCartney could put this record out in time, before the Beatles officially announced their breakup, accompanied by a press release explaining that he, Paul McCartney, had quit the Beatles, he could make it appear that he was responsible for the Beatles's that breakup and gain the upper hand. Needless to say, the ruse worked. <br />I disagree that \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is a \\"great\\" song, by the way. I do like it, but I like it mostly because of one line, one uncharacteristically honest line, \\"Maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something he doesn't really understand\\". John Lennon, in his last interview in Playboy (just before he was assassinated), said that Paul McCartney is perfectly capable of writing good lyrics but usually doesn't bother to try. I think this assessment is right on the mark. It saddened me gradually to discover as well how rarely in his solo career he would bother to try to write  good music or finished songs. At least his first solo record,  \\"McCartney\\", has an excuse (even if it is an ethically dubious one).
B000067J1H|5.0|FightClub (FC) isn't a movie. It's a superbly well-portrayed philosophy. A culmination of the all the events that led to the excesses of capitalism, this movie smashes them all, in their face. It is impossible for someone who has never seen this movie to read a review and decide on buying the DVD. You just have to see the movie, in case you missed it, you just have to buy the DVD. Well, let me just start by quoting a line from this masterpiece, \\"How much do you know about yourself, when you've never been in a fight?\\". How much can you base your joy upon someone else's deeds (reviews) when you never saw the movie yourself?  <br />FC is the Taxi Driver of the 2000s. It portrays all the decadence from the evils of excess materialism. Unfortunately, capitalism is a cause for this excess. Not to say its an evil in itself but as Thorstein Veblen pointed out many decades ago, the greatest enemy of capitalism is not communism or the trade unions, it is the heartless, money-spinning, corporations. Galbraith pointed out in the fifties that companies change consumer preferences through advertising. Tyler Durder in FC says \\"You are not your khakis\\". This movie is as much about understanding economics as it is about entertainment. Dont define yourself by the CK name on your sleeve, or the Ralph Lauren, who is getting free advertising when ever you show his name off your clothes. every young man can associte the IKEA nesting habbit shown in the movie. its sadly true about new galaxies being named after super corporations because they are taking over our lives. Demand seems to have stopped driving supply, its supply that is driving demand. I am sure this movie would make J B Say quite happy for that point. And its true, ever wondered why people who buy a $ 100,000 machine say they bought it for \\"Engineering\\"? I am sure these guys dont understand how their airconditioners work forget the car. <br />The dialogues in the movie make the movie worth watchin many times over. \\"Sooner orlater, the things you own, end up owning you\\", \\"I found freedon, losing all hope was freedom\\". well there are so many lines like that in the movie, you would want to get the screenplay. <br />The casting is just perfect. the actors never give you the impression that they are acting, which is how it shhould be. Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helena Bonham deliver the performance of their lives. A feature film cannot get better than this. David Fincher is not only detailed at the micro level (the opening credits of human brain anatomy or the scene were Ed Nortons flats gets filled with furniture) also at the macro level (Ed Norton realizing that he is Tyler Durden and the way script progresses from Project Mayhem to the end). What a movie! Fincher is one of the best directors of Hollywood. <br />Well, credit goes to Jim Ulhs for the awesome screenplay and Chuck Palahniuk for writing the great book with the same name. This movie rules! Fincher, Ulhs and Palahniuk gave us something that we could cherish till we die. the ending is poetic, with a mind-blowing song from The Pixies enthralling you while saying \\" Where is my mind\\", so apt!!!<br />Watch it, watch it again and agiin, you will never be the same. this movie is a beatiful mix of philosophy, economics, psychology, all set in high-powered fightclub atmosphere. This movie brings great joy and great pain at teh same time (that awesome feeling). well, let me finish with a line from the movie \\" Its only after you lost everything, you are free to do anything\\"....
B00006GA4C|5.0|If you want to hear the hardest hitting GFR album. This is the one for you. The raw power sound of this recording is in my opinion by far the best GFR has to offer. On time is a great set with lots of good material on it. But The Red Album (Grand Funk Railroad) Slams the door on candy rock and explodes with hard hitting POWER! From the 1st cord of GOT THIS THING ON THE MOVE it is a powerhouse of rock. I usually have to listen to a recording a few times to get into it. This was not the case with this recording. I first heard it within a couple months of its original release and It blew me away from the start. It has been long awaited, and this much appreciated re-release is great to hear again. In my opinion this is the top of the game for GFR. It just plane ol KICKS you know where.

B000067CPX|5.0|If you know the chili peppers and  own, or at least have heard some of their earlier albums, you know that their style has changed drastically.  With every new Album the Red Hot Chili Pepeprs release they introduce a different style of music.  When they started out in the early 80's they were a more hardcore mix of punk and funk and now wit hteh release of By The Way, they show how much they have changed over the years.  <br />This album is mroe of a softer funk with many slow songs.  If at first you do not liek this CD do not immediately think of returning it.  This album definitly grows on you, and if you give it some time you will like it.  When i first bougt it i absolutely hated it becasue it was so diufferent from every other chili pepeprs album, but after listenin to it i absolutely love it.  The Chili Peppers are a band who you need to either work forward or backward when buying their CDs.  If this is the only RHCP album you own and are looking for others to buy start out with Californication, and work your way backwards to Blood Sugar Sex Magic and then Mothers Milk.<br />I am a very big chili peppers fan and i own nearly every cd from their debut self title album red hot chili pepeprs to by the way to imports like live rare remix  and over 15 singles with many non album tracks on them...
B000001Y42|5.0|...From an honest metal listener...this CD is good. I don't listen to Limpbizkit that much, I don't love them, nor do I hate them. Basically this album to me is where they should have stopped their career. It's got great songs, and they are really original instrumentally. The song structures are either basic or complex, but pretty good, and bassist Sam Rivers does a great job laying down some sticky bass lines that move the song along. If you like speed metal or 80's metal like Pantera/Slayer/whatnot, then no, you probably won't like this. Get it into your head that its a completely different genre and those two shouldn't be compared. This is Nu-metal where it began (along with Korn's \\"Korn\\" and Deftones' \\"Adrenaline\\") and if you don't like Nu-Metal that's good for you, I don't like Heavy Metal.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Listening to this cd is like gawking at a highway accident.  As unnerving as it is, one cannot look away.  The obvious comparisons to Joy Division... I can see why.  But that's just at the surface.  That's just cosmetics.  Underneath, lies a totaly different beast.  At times it feels like seasoned musicians decided to forget how to play their instruments on purpose, resulting in an interesting mixture of garage punk and early eighties new wave.
B00006F83Y|5.0|You know those CDs were every single song in them is great? well this is one of them. Im not saying all of them are hits but every song just experiments a lot, my favourite would have to be Millionare and Go with the flow, they are just great songs with a lot of emotion. The way it is produces is also very good. I would have to say that this band has evolved a lot since there first album. I would really like to give it a 4.5 because i feel that maybe some songs are not that good in the sense that I would listen to them often, but the use of variuous layers of guitars justifies it.
B000089CKH|5.0|I read a review of this album in the Rolling Stone a while back.  I was impressed by what the critic had to say about a band that, to me, was only memorable for &quot;Popular&quot;.  I wanted to hear the new material from this particular band, and ended up downloading &quot;Inside Of Love&quot;.  What can I say.  20 minutes later I had the freshly bought cd in my hand.  I simply cannot understand why I refuse to take this album out of my cd player.  I rememeber buying the Zwan cd, and getting sick of it after about 3 listens.  But I bought Let Go in the winter of 2003.  And now it's SUMMER!  And I'm still listening to it.  It's still fresh.<br />A real quick comparison that I must make.  It occured to me that not only Coldplay and Travis listened to Radiohead's The Bends.  Nada Surf must have had it playing in the background while making this album.
B00005JKN9|5.0|what a magnificent film! my only regret is that i waited until the dvd release to see it! i've been mesmerized 3 times in 2 days as to it's vast beauty, spectacle, and non stop entertainment values! yes, daniel day lewis is as brilliant as always, but mr. dicaprio as well as ms.diaz blend in beautifully in a great ensemble of great actors to help bring to the screen mr. scorceses awesome vision and imagination. this is his finest work and really should have been honored at oscar time. i say bravo to all involved and thank you for a flawless dvd!
B000002UAU|5.0|On first hearing this album, I certainly did not have second thoughts about the writing, construction, harmony, etc. of the songs. This album is not only my favourite Beatles album of all time, it is my favourite album of all time (of course, compared to anything else)...<br />A true classic!
B00000K19E|3.0|A lot of fun.  The inner working of computer code, far into the future, when programs are represented from within by humanoid characters, who in turn monitor the sleeping humans who live as well inside the simulation, as they sleep in reality.   <br />A group of humans attempt to break out and mayhem ensues.  Plenty of analogies to real current day programming techniques, and when taken as a trilogy, a fair amount of pholosophy running quietly in the back ground. Also, the trilogy will have tons of surprises---this movie is actually quite intellectually impressive.<br /> this movie is just fun!!! <br /> I am planning on getting the trilogy when it comes out as a boxed set early 2004.
0553277472|1.0|This book is obsessive, condescending claptrap, and a self-indulgent attempt to justify obsessive, condescending behavior.
0790742780|2.0|takes an interesting premise and then takes it a bit too far.  In addition, I felt that the movie went for the easy gags/shock effect, like the pepsi incident, while he was trying to make a phone call.  And call me crazy, but have you ever heard of a cop on his last day before retirement acting like Duval did? Ya godda be kidding, the movie fell down, er..., on that alone!!
B000051YEG|4.0|The lazy bassline which bleeds through the speakers to open the album suggest the sophisticated leachery which is to follow. This, of course, is Serge Gainsbourg, the man who, more than anyone else in the music industry, or any industry for that matter, epitomised the shameless romanticism for which the French are known. That he was in fact a Russain Jew by birth is testament to the contradictory nature of this man. Anyway, \\"Melody\\", the first track, concerns his first encounter with the eponymous Sunderland-born(!) heroine, and is utterly gorgeous at that. Serge's intimate whisper of a vocal seems to be the loudest thing here, booming over the spare arrangment of guitar, bass and drums, whose graceful funk is elegant while also suggesting the dubious intentions of the singer towards Melody. The addition of the dramatic strings throughout this track is luxuriant and erotic and is possibly one of the greatsest use of a string section in the histroy of rock music: economical, dramatic and emtional. The track is a masterpiece, and worth the price alone. But, as the title suggests, this album is a story, and so it unfolds. The structure of the album is therefore very important. This is why Serge's decision to bookend the album with what are by far and away the longest and also mutually very similar tracks, has the emotional impact it does have. As previous reviewers have noted, this is the story of an old French sleazeball (could it be Serge, I wonder?) in a chance encounter with a young (very young) English girl (Melody). He proceeds to seduce this girl and take her to his special hotel room to have his way with her, before she flies back to England, only for the plane to crash on the way, leaving Melody dead. So a romantic story then, of course with Serge's own twisted sense of humour. The unravelling of this tale is matched by equally moody music. Following \\"Melody\\", the next series of tracks (from \\"Ballade de Melody Nelson\\" to \\"En Melody\\") are much shorter and coverground from languid, alluring torch song (\\"Ballade...\\") through sweet and elegant waltz (\\"Valse de Melody\\") to abrasive, jittery funk, complete with Jane Birkin (Serge's foil for this concept album) squeeling over the top. At a mere half an hour in length, the most startling achievement is the amount of emtoinal ground covered. Each track is coherent with the previous and suggests what is to come in the following track, allowing each stage of Serge's tale to be spun eloquently without overstaying its welcome. The final track (\\"Cargo Culte\\") sees Sergs lamenting the passing away of his love as he appeals to the heavens, much in the style of the Papuan Cargo Cultists, who pray to the sky for planes to crash in the jungle depositing bounty on the ground for their pillaging. It is fundamentally a retake of the opening track, albeit with different lyrics. The death of Melody puts Serge in a reflective mood, thinking back to the bliss of their first encounter, hence the similarity. Yet the slightly de-tuned guitars and less measured percussion shed light on the pain and sorrow he is experiencing. The gorgeous strings of the first track, however, are replaced by an ominous, funereal choir and rattling percussion, perfectly evoking the the crashing metal of the aeroplane, before reaching its bombastic, rock-opera-style climax in the dying seconds. Listening to this in hindsight, one is struck by how modern this album sounds. The steady foundation of bass throughout presaged the music of Beck, Beta Band, Stone Roses and even electronic artists such as DJ Shadow and Tricky. I can only imagine how daring and outrageous this would have sounded back in the early 70s. Yet here it is today, sounding as fresh, moving and sexy as ever, the sound so unquie, it is doubtful that it will ever grow dated. This is a worthy addition to any collection, which will be enjoyed for years by any discerning owner. I have seen many people comment on the brevity of this album, which is rather missing the point, I feel; 28 minutes is simply how long it takes to tell this story, get this point across, and when the music itself is so good anyway, it seems a moot point. Buy, enjoy, learn some French. Your life will be better for it.<BR>P.S. If you need proof as to the influence of this album, get hold of \\"Sea Change\\" by Beck, and put on \\"Paper Tiger\\". It is either the most shameless example of artistic pilfering I have ever heard, or a wonderful tribute to a great piece of music. I'm going with both.
0345440900|1.0|This book is too short to be the &quot;word&quot; on parenting; especially on getting your child to sleep through the night.  Some ideas sound good but they are not developed thoroughly.  I found the book to be very impractical after my daughter arrived.  For now on I am sticking with the advise of my doctor, The American Academy of Pediatrics and Dr. Sears.
B00005JLYU|4.0|That's the phrase that kept popping into my head every time the Angels--Cameron, Drew, and Lucy--engaged in one of their frequent kicking and punching ecstasies. Cameron especially seemed to glory in her role as a violent cheerleader type. Plot has to do with retrieving two rings that if used together, reveal the new names and locations of every single person in the witness protection program--including, shockingly, one of the Angels herself!<BR>So we also have soul-searching episodes when one of the Angels knows fear deep down inside that if she doesn't leave the trio, the other two gals might get hurt. An interesting aside to this (which probably wasn't intentional) is that there is something a little too real to the Angel's somewhat paralyzed response to seeing her former abusive boyfriend. Here we've seen her beat all manner of people up in the movie, but she seems terrified of this guy, so it brings to mind the emotional problems many abused women do have trying to sever from an abuser.<br />However, not to dwell on that too much. I didn't see the first movie, so in reading other reviews, I see that there have been cast changes and continuing characters as well. Doesn't matter a jot if you're new to the \\"Charlie's Angels\\" scene. It was interesting to see that Demi Moore is our villainess, and that many of the reviewers are, \\"wow, she's really old at 40\\". Mix of age-ism and sexism, I guess, on their parts.<br />Shakespeare it ain't. If, however, you want to vege out in an air-conditioned theatre and watch an upbeat nonsensical action movie, then \\"Full Throttle\\"'s for you.
B00000IB4D|5.0|Long before he became boring (right after Shango), long before he had to hook up with young kids to catch the young set, before any of these kids were even born, there was &quot;Welcome,&quot; an excellent album on its first side (for those of us old enough to know exactly what that is), and a decent enough one on its reverse.  &quot;Love, Devotion and Surrender&quot;  is clearly the breakout hit here, although the entire first side is excellent.  Things lag a bit on the B-side (too much intospection, not nough groove), but not enough to mar the entire effort.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|It's pretty rare for me to like a movie enough to actually buy (vice rent) the DVD; Memento was one of those rare exceptions.  What can I say - the entire cast is great, the storyline is top-notch, and the production is undestated enough to give you that Indie-movie feel, but without the pretensions that usualy accompany it. If there is just one fault that I can find with the movie, it is that, in the end, when the actual beginning of the story is being told, it's explained just a bit too much.  One could easily cut half the voiceover at the end, and still have a fine production.
0375422307|5.0|Persepolis is strong medicine.  Its artwork  affected my emotions  with an intensity that belied its simplicity.  Perhaps it's the careful way the characters' eyes are shown to be looking in exactly the right place.  Persepolis is soaked in tragedy, as one might expect of any memoir of this time and place.  It is also very funny, in spite of the frequent human anguish.  My favorite panel: \\"Punk was in, I was looking sharp.\\"  What makes Persepolis more than a dreary history lesson is little Marjane and her brave, humane family.  Marjane confronts an increasingly oppressive society and bleak future with an irrepressible spirit.  I hope the sequel is translated soon, so we can find out what happened after she went to Austria.
068817776X|5.0|Edith Hahn Beer is a Jewess, now living in Netanya Israel. In 1938, pro-Nazi Vienna, she was an intelligent, inquisitive law student, with an adventurous spirit. After Anschluss, the German's pressed the Austrian Jews for all their money and valuables in return for exit visas. Some families had to decide, because of a lack of funds, which of their children could leave for safer havens, and which were doomed to stay in Austria with their parents, and almost certain deportation. Edith's two sisters left the country, but she remained with her childhood friend and lover, Pepi, with the hope they would soon marry.<br />She was sent to a labor camp in the north of Germany to do backbreaking farm work, 12 hours a day, six days a week. The motto of some of the Jewish laborers was, \\"Life is beautiful, and it begins tomorrow.\\" Her mother was deported to the East while Edith was in Germany, helpless to assist or join her beloved parent. When she finally returned to Vienna, her home and family were gone. Her remaining friends, Jew and Gentile, with few exceptions, were afraid to assist her. Her beloved Pepi, whose Jewish father had married a non-Jew, was a weak man, dominated by his mother. And the mother wanted nothing to do with Edith. A prewar friend, who also happened to be a doctor, and a Nazi Party bureaucrat, assisted Edith, and another gentile friend obtained copies of her own identity papers for her. Edith writes, \\"Our faces will be imprinted on the hearts of those who are kind to us, like a blessing.\\"<br />So, she moved to Munich, in 1942, submerging her identity in the wartime Reich. Edith Hahn disappeared from the face of the earth and Grete Denner emerged to replace everything Edith had ever been. Grete was not only a new identity, she was a totally different woman; mild, meek, unassuming and uneducated - hard to pick out of a crowd. Thus began life as a \\"U-boat,\\" submerged beneath the surface of society in Nazi Germany. She writes, \\"Now I am like Dante. I walk through hell, but I am not burning.\\" Living in mortal fear, she found work as a nurses aide, and a room with a kind family. She met a handsome Aryan, Werner Vetter, who wooed her persistently. When he pressured her to marry, she finally blurted out her secret. Werner accepted her Jewishness, to the extent that he still wanted to marry and protect her. He wanted to sleep with her and have her take care of him. But her husband never rid himself of Nazi prejudices about \\"Jewish blood,\\" and resisted having a child with Edith/Grete. She, in turn, became the passive, perfect wife Werner desired, abandoning any remaining sense of self. The ironies of her existence increased as the war progressed, and Germany's doom became obvious to almost all. Then Werner, blind in one eye, was drafted and became an officer in the Wehrmacht. Edith/Grete became pregnant - the Ideal Aryan Wife, with a baby on the way and a husband at the front.<br />This is a powerful account of a person existing in a schizophrenic life, with constant fear of discovery, and almost no sense of identity. The isolation was devastating. One can only imagine Edith's survivor guilt, which most Holocaust survivors suffer from. Here she was living the \\"normal\\" life of a German Hausfrau, while millions of others, like her own mother, went to the camps and crematorium. She discusses this guilt frankly in the book. She was and is an extraordinarily brave woman. We are fortunate that, at great risk to her life, she kept a record of her survival and has chosen to share her inspiring story.<br />This intimate narrative is simply and intelligently written. Her tale is so gripping that it is almost impossible to put down. At times it does seem that truth is stranger than fiction. I highly recommend this autobiographical account of a woman's life in hell.

B00005JKN9|4.0|that would be a great DVD feature for this movie. to totally remove the useless characters of Leo and Diaz. much like Titanic, his lack of cinematic charisma drags down what could have been a much better movie. the sets were gorgeous. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best anti-heroes in movie history.
6305537798|5.0|Generally speaking I abhor most of the films sheltering under the umbrella-genre of \\"teen comedy\\". The idea of a film made specifically to gratify the insecure and the horny makes me kind of queasy. In an entertained sort of way. <br />But...10 Things I Hate About You, despite its cringe-worthy title, is a cut and a jump above the rest. Lay to rest the ghosts of \\"She's All That\\" and other related Freddie Prince Jnr cast-offs and worship at the altar of a truly funny slice of teen life. <br />You know the drill. 10 Things is based loosely around the lesser-known Shakespeare play \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\". And, against all expectations the adaptation is intelligently done. The interaction of Shakespearian dialogue and ultra-trendy American teen speak is blended without hesitation. \\"I burn, I perish, I pine...\\" proclaims the love-struck Cameron in the words of the bard himself. \\"Put her in your spank-bank and move on\\" replies his Tranio-a-like sidekick Michael. The more you know about the Shakespeare play, the more you'll appreciate the subtleties of 10 Thing's referencing. Of course the plot isn't exact, but its themes are maintained in healthy condition throughout. <br />So, this is a production that didn't take its script-writing according to formular. Some of the one-liners are literally classic, and the supporting cast, particularly Miss Perky, school councillar and erotic novelist extroadinaire, are different and lively.  <br />That doesn't mean, however, that the star acting suffers. The cast has strong leaders in Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, both of whom transcend and epitomise the teen hero/heroine simultaneously. Refreshingly, Stile's character doesn't succumb to being objectified by her inevitable good lucks. Ledger doesn't just convince her that wearing a dress is going to make her a more convincing \\"girl\\". Of course guy does get girl, but in the same way girl thoroughly establishes herself as equal to said guy. And looses none of her expressive capacity.<br />The scaffolding sub-plot also turns out some cracking performances from the likes of Joseph Gordon-Hewitt as Cameron (you'll recognise him as the kid from 3rd Rock from the Sun), and the pretty Larisa Oleynik as Bianca. <br />Mix all of the above ... with the likes of Letters from Cleo enjoying several cameo moments and you've got a movie that could very well join \\"Empire Records\\" as teen classic material.
B00008X5J1|1.0|This is what happens when a brilliant director trades in intelligent storytelling with trashy MTV style substance. What should've been a fascinating look at the 19th century street thugs of early Brooklyn (An element Sergio Leone achieved with the superior Once Upon A Time In America) is instead a bloated 3 hour examination of gratuitous violence, bloodshed, sexual nudity<br />and racist dialogue. With the exception of Daniel Day Lewis, everyone is either ill defined or miscasted. DiCaprio and Diaz belong in the latter category. Their laughably atrocious acting ruins some of the film. The opening battle scene lacks excitement<br />and is vastly inferior to classics like Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, and Gladiator. Spielberg saw this and said the violence is more implied. what a joke, he calls this implied. When I saw this, a couple of big Scorsese fans I knew were throwing up in the movie theater. Scorsese also said the bloodshed was implied. Don't belive that. This has so much brutality that it makes Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino look like Disney movies. With the exception of this one, Kundun, and Bringing Out The Dead, all of Martin Scorsese's other films are classics that were far more worthy of it's oscars than this piece of junk. Despite Lewis performance, I hated his character.<br />THe only words that came out of his mouth were racist stuff. His<br />character is overly violent that he makes Joe Pesci's Tommy Devito look like Prince Charming. Robert De Niro and Willem Dafoe were originally going to take Day Lewis's role, but they rejected it. Now the two of them look like geniuses despite the fact it was oscar nominated. When Raging Bull lost best picture and director to Robert Redford's Ordinary People, I was upset cause I wanted Raging Bull to win. When Goodfellas lost best picture and best director to Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves,<br />I was upset, I wanted Goodfellas to win. When Gangs Of New York was shut out of all 10 oscar nominations I was happy. His other films should've gotten all those nominations cause they were better than this film. THe only nominations Gangs Of New York should've got were Best actor, Best Art Direction/Set Direction,<br />and Best Costume Design, but since the movie is a disappointment<br />I still would've shut those nominations out. Thank you Academy Awards for giving the best picture to Chicago which is a film that deserved it is more entertaining than Gangs Of New York. Gangs Of New York is an example of why Hollywood is falling down. Two reasons. 1. This is over hyped. As it was in Windtalkers, this one dosen't talk about what it was supposed to. 2.  Unlike the 70's, 80's, and 90's where films would have character development and intelligent storytelling, to put in other words, it has everthing you want including violence that is<br />never never and triple never gratuitous. Now that were in the new millenium films have turned away from all that and the violence in films in the 21'st century (not all of them), but in over hyped films like this one are gratuitous. Scorsese's a brilliant filmmaker and he deserves a best director oscar, but not for Gangs Of New York, he deserves it for his other ones like the all time classics Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Shame on the Golden GLobes for giving the best director to him when he has done other great films. Well at least the oscars didn't make that mistake. Thank God.

B00006879E|5.0|All I can say is &quot;WOW&quot;! This group is great &amp; their CD proves it! They have a new sound that's original and funky.All of their songs are great &amp; I would recommend this CD to anyone...but if you don't like them, yur dumb! :P
0385504209|5.0|For several years I researched the Sangreal and the &quot;tale&quot; of Mary Magdalene to come to the same conclusions as within this book. I met with the same resistance from my priest, went through much self growth, and acceptance of the feminine that I've never had before because of this research.  Here, in a fictional story, what I perceive to be a truth frames the action.  How exciting to look up the paintings all over again, revisit some of my research notes, and play along with the author of this book! A real suspenseful, fast paced surprise ending. Highly recommend!
0156027321|5.0|I've read hundreds of reader reviews on Amazon, but have never written one before...until now.  This book's ending caught me so off guard that as soon as I finished, I turned to the first page and started reading the book again.  The first read was a great story.  The second read was a fantastic spiritual journey.<br />Since I already believe in God this book was not able to convert me.  What it did for me, however, was remind me that, while my faith in God may look like \\"hallucinations\\" to the outsider, I have been lucky to live the ups and downs of the \\"better story.\\"  Perhaps Pi and I ARE crazy for believing that Richard Parker, a 450 pound Bengal tiger, exists and really did slip back into the jungle without being seen by anyone else.  But as long as Pi and I believe, I feel lucky to be in such good company.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I am a fan of blues/rock artists, and have always been very selective on my musical taste, but I have to admit, as much as i don't want to, that Christina has some pipes! She got out of the teenie-bopper title and now is doin her own thing. She should try some blues, with that voice she'd kick...<BR>Minus some pointless \\"talking jive\\" points, the record is great, i recommend this to some, but not fans of my own preferences in blues, to me this may just be a guilty pleasure, and may have something related to her crazy sex appeal.
0064407667|5.0|I am a second grade teacher and I read the first three books aloud to my students.  They enjoyed them so much that students would purchase the books on their own and read them along with me.  A few students even purchased subsequent books to read on their own.  <BR>Like many reviewers, I loved that fact that the author included vocabulary instruction while I was reading the chapters aloud to my students.  I also felt that the plot was exciting and captured the attention of my students.<BR>Although the Baudelaire children live very tragic lives, the one theme that comes across in all the books is the importance of having each other to lean on in any situation.  What I also like about these stories is all three children (along with the Quagmire triplets) have a unique talent and all of the children are integral to the plot of the stories.  Unlike some reviewers, I believe that these books are great reading for children because they teach children to value the support from others.  The books, while pessimistic, have an optimistic view because the orphans do not let anything get in their way of achieving true happiness!
B00004SZWD|5.0|I am a 16 year old who thought he had a good conception of music, until I heard Songs in the key of life.  After I heard Songs, I knew that all the music that I had heard could not even compare to this album.  My mother is really into Stevie, and I am sure that I had heard the music growing up, but I had never really listened to it.  I really love knocks me off my feet, love's in need of love today, summer soft, another star, and all of the other songs but &quot;As&quot; by far stands out as the most powerful song.  With lyrics like &quot;until you dream of life and life becomes a dream&quot; and &quot;did you know that true love asks for nothing, her acceptance is the way we pay&quot;, accompanied with his masterful piano playing and message of love being &quot;turn your words into truth, and then change that truth into love&quot;, As has got to be one of the greatest Stevie songs ever made, and in my opinion, amongst the top 10 songs ever made.  I would strongly recommend that you listen to Innervisions before you listen to Songs.  Some would say that Innervisions is better, with &quot;Living for the city&quot;, and &quot;Golden Lady&quot;(my favorite song) being its high point.  I love both of the albums.<BR>Stevie Wonder, to me, represents divine inspiration.  Nobody but GOD could inspire those lyrics.  I got into an argument with one of my friends over which singer was better, Marvin Gaye or Stevie Wonder.  Marvin was wonderful but Stevie won 3 grammy's for Album of the year, a fete accomplished by only him.
B00003CXIY|5.0|I used to not have interest in this movie when it first came out, so I never bothered to see it.  After a few years I finally decided to and I couldnt believe I had waited so long.  It was one of the funniest movies ever.  I love Sean William Scott.  Hes one of the best comedy actors out their.  Tom Green's part in this movie was great also.  He wasnt in it as much as I thought he would be, but he was funny the whole time.  If you havnt seen this you are missing out! Buy it without seeing it if you have to!!
B000001A6F|5.0|If there is someone out there who is timid about buying this album, don't be.  Superwoman (where were you when I needed you) is one of Stevie Wonder's best song.  Immediately, in the beginning of the song, Stevie uses his lyrical skills to turn a simple statement like &quot;very well&quot; into a double-entendre, and just when I thought the song was ending, it broke into this wonderful melody displaying Stevie's superior skills in many instruments.  Than, the vocals at the end are so amazing, and the way Stevie delivers the lyrics is even more amazing.  This song is 8 minutes of sheer greatness, and this song alone should convince you to buy the album.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever released, I won't waste your time, just buy it. Even if you accidentally stumbled across this page, and you don't even know who Dream Theater is, just buy the album. <br />If you are reading this; you are not buying the album, just buy it already and hear for yourself why this is one of the best albums ever!
B00005JM09|5.0|I have not seen the movie, only the trailer, and by that alone, I think this movie will be superb!  The action looks very cool, and while nothing in life is guarenteed, this is about as close as it comes!  I can't wait 'till they come out with the DVD!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a great Dream Theater Album. It is one of the most aggressive ones, as well as, the album that introduced me to Dream Theater. What can I say, It opens off with The Glass Prison, a 13+ minute song that blows you away (probably the heaviest of the album, and my favorite, where Portnoy comes out with both basses blaring as Petrucci unleashes crazy solos and punishing riffs. That is just the first few minutes! Words alone can not describe the prog. metal bliss that one feels when listening to this album. If you are looking for an album with instrumentals that make your head spin, solos that wear out the rewind button on your CD player, and thoughtful intelligent lyrics that will leave paper cuts on your fingers, then you must buy this CD!
B000099T2L|5.0|This should be the best r&b cd of the year!! I like every song on the album bcuz they all are different . She is not saying awww baby like Ashanti!! She has three songs that are so beautiful to me . Yes - This is the best song on the cd. Speechless - This song is so pretty . Signs - Another lovely song. Beyonce has some good writing skills like on Hip Hop Star and Naughty Girl. The whole cd is just different from all the other R&B cats out there . You should definitely get this album.
B000099T2L|4.0|I was surprised like everyone else with all of the slow jams on here. Beyonce always sung slow songs well though, so it was a good surprise. A few more uptempo songs would have been nice, because few female singers can bring the funk like her. Her duet with Luther really surprised me though, I just wasn't their voices to blend so well. Luther did a great job arranging their vocals on this Roberta Flack remake. Some of my other favorite cuts are: Crazy In Love, Baby Boy, Yes, and Be With You. My favorite song is actually Me, Myself, &amp; I though. I just liked the music and the way she sung it. Some brutha's might not like the lyrics to this song that much, but she sings it with a passion that didn't seem hateful to me. Hopefully she'll bring more funkier cuts like Crazy In Love next time. I actually had wanted something closer to the original Destiny's Child sound, which was why I had liked her, but this was nice surprise.
B00007KQKM|3.0|Ken Russell is still the master of D.H. Lawrence on film - at least for now.  If you like the original purple prose, which I do, you should like the purple in this series. (You might also consider buying \\"Women in Love.\\") Sean Bean, as Oliver Mellors is always a good excuse to watch a movie.  He and Joely Richardson, as Constance Chatterley, offer really nice performances - even James Wilby as her priggish \\"Clifford\\" is very angering in a believable way.  I had to make peace with the lousy soundtrack that intruded on the dialogue and action and saps the oxygen from the passion Russell wants to portray.  I was not crazy about the unevenness of the script, ranging from juvenile to thoughtful dialogue on the meaning of love, compassion and class.  Think of the first disc as exposition and the second disc offering a truer soul of the story and worth buying the series.  Would this have been better as a shorter feature film? Just remember that the book articulates Mellors' complexity as a veteran of WWI and a member of the working class who has educated himself even though he tries to fit in with his peers and English social structure. Also, Russell takes a liberty with the ending. If you want better instruction on gameskeeping, read the novel. \\"Angels and Insects\\" would make a great little film festival on the same themes presented as or more sensually than \\"Lady Chatterley.\\" Really, hearing Bean say \\"lass\\" is just heaven even to this feminist mind.

0060934913|4.0|I guess I have a deep desire to be a professional chef, because it seems like lately I keep reading these books written by chefs about the restaurant industry.  If you are a foodie, like myself, and want to know what goes on behind the scenes of a restaurant, you don't want to pass up this wonderful memoir written by Anthony Bourdain!!<br />Anthony has written a hard core, crass, but also sensitive look at what goes on behind the scenes at your favorite eateries.  More importantly, he talks freely about what it takes to make it in this crazy business.  Anyone with visions of grandeur and thinking that being a chef is glamorous better read this book...and think again.<br />I loved Mr. Bourdain's style of writing, and I pored over every page soaking it all in.  Everyone considering becoming a chef should be required to read this book before wasting money on going to culinary school.  As Mr. Bourdain points out, only a few of those actually graduating from culinary school actually go on to being chefs.  Most people just can't take it.<br />This was such a fun and interesting read.  I never wanted it to end.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Before you dismiss this as just another in the long list of terrorists-hold-innocents-hostage-hero-single-handedly-saves-the-day actioners, let me point out that this was the first of its kind. All the others that followed were mere imitations, and not very good ones at that.<br />Which leads me to this assessment: even if Die Hard weren't the first of this genre, it would still be the best. No other terrorist-hostage movie has ever come close to the energy and thrills that this one has to offer. <br />Bruce Willis, previously best-known for his role as the wise-cracking partner of Cybil Shepherd in the TV series Moonlighting, makes a remarkably sucessful transition to the big screen, taking on the role of NY cop John MacLane. In LA to join his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company's Christmas party, he suddenly finds himself single-handedly taking on a band of terrorists led by Hans Grueber, played to elegant perfection by Alan Rickman.<br />The action is definitely first-rate, the highlight easily being the scene where MacLane jumps off the high-rise's roof just as a bomb behind him detonates, hanging on to a fire hose that dislodges from its slot. <br />But there are other plot elements that give this movie more substance than others of its genre. One is the troubled state of MacLane's marriage, which makes for a character of more depth. Our hero is only human, grappling with problems just like you and me. Another is the interaction between MacLane and beat officer Powell (Reginald Vel Johnson). Communicating only by radio, they start off as two cops exchanging vital information. Soon, their conversations take on a more personal nature, and before they even see each other, their relationship evolves from professional to friendly. A nice touch, culminating in an affectionate bear hug when they finally meet.<br />Perhaps most interesting is the character of Rickman. Yes, we've seen classy bad guys before, but Grueber, with his sartorial elegance and erudite eloquence, certainly stands out. (You know that game where you take turns quoting lines from movies, and the others have to identify the movie and the character who delivered the line? Try this: \\"Alexander examined the breadth of his domain, and wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.\\" They'll give all sorts of wrong answers, then you proclaim, \\"Die Hard, Hans Grueber!\\")<br />Of course, the rip-roaring action alone would earn Die Hard four stars. But thankfully, the producers made the effort to reach for the fifth star.
B00008X5J1|5.0|Martin Scorsese has done it again.  He has managed to tell a New York story unlike any one else.  He has managed to mix both fact and fiction seemlessly.  The story is based on the gang wars of the Five Points neighborhood of New York City during the Civil War conscription riots.  The groups the gangs \\"represent\\" are the nativists, the people who were born in America and the various immigrant Irish gangs.  The movie portrays the story about who is going to control the five points area, one of the most notorious slums in the United States during the Civil War period.<br />The two lead characters are Cutter the Butcher played by Daniel-Day Lewis and Amsterdam played by Leonardo DiCaprio.  Cutter is the leader of the nativist gang and is vicious.  He beats on the immigrants and thinks nothing of mudering them in daylight.  Amsterdam is the leader of the Irish immigrants opposing Cutter.  A subtext to the story is that Cutter murdered Amsterdam's father in the opening scene of the movie and Amsterdam is seeking revenge.<br />The movie is both stunning and stark to watch.  Scorsese has done a magnificent job of rebuilding the Five Corners and bringing it to life.  Scorsese depicts brilliantly the squalor of the poor and the missionaries who live among them trying to help.  <br />Scorsese also uses the Civil War Conscription riots as a backdrop to the gang wars.  As the tension builds over the gangs, the tension over the Civil War also builds among New York.  If a person was drafted into the Army, they could buy their way out for a sum of $300 which was more than a years pay for the poor.  The buyout was for the rich to avoid sending their sons to battle.  The movie closes with the final battle between the two groups during a city wide riot over the conscription.<br />The Gangs of New York is just under 3 hours long and the time flies.  This movie is well worth watching and makes a nice addition for the personal library.
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is a non-stop, intellectually thrilling novel. For the first time this summer, I got to read a book that had some substance - some meat. Dan Brown writes a well-researched and well-developed story. It started quickly and held me until the very end. While the story was excellent, the religious background captivated me further - I even went online to learn more about the Priory of Scion, Leonardo da Vinci, and Mary Magdelene. I look forward to more Robert Langdon mysteries. Those who like Dan Brown's characters will also enjoy Nelson DeMille's Plum Island and The Lion's Game.
B00005UKE0|3.0|I can't believe the reviews claiming that All Things Must Pass is the best Beatle solo effort. It is pretty good, but doesn't even come close to  Plastic Ono Band and  Imagine by John Lennon or McCartney and Band on the Run by Paul. I have noticed that if one goes back and listens to some of the demos of George Harrison's best Beatles songs (like While My Guitar Gently Weeps), they all sound very simular; TOO simular. I believe that Paul and John took George's raw songs and helped him give them each individual sounds. Without the other Beatles, all George's songs sound almost the same. All Things must Pass suffers greatly from a lack of Paul and John's help (and it is by far George's best album); All the songs have that same old sound and the album seems to  go on and on with all the jamming and trying to stretch one albums worth of mostly mediocre songs into a lot of -wasted- record space. I LOVED some of George's Beatles songs, but I suspect that at least half the credit for those songs should go the other Beatles. I think that that is the reason that Lennon and McCartney never took George seriously as any sort of competition in the song writing department. RIP.
