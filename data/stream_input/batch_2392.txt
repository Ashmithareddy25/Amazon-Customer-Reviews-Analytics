B00CDT41RY|5.0|The action sequences were great. Although the storyline is unbelievable, it was still entertaining. Isn't that what's movies are supposed to be about?
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I wish that I could say that I'm glad the show was awesome, but I can't. The fact that after getting really great they just got kicked into nothingness. Sucks.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fun, cute, and every bit as entertaining as the first two. If you loved the others, you will love this sequel. I highly recommend it for kids and adults alike. At 99 cents you can't go wrong with this fun game! Help your Om Noms go &quot;Nom! Nom!&quot; :)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Always loved this Movie had to own it. Showed it to some friends that had never seen it & they loved it too
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|A great movie worth the watch. Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. No guessing what or who the evil one is in this movie
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I could enjoy reading this again and will probably enjoy it equally as well.  I loved the not being able to figure out all the nuances and reading a hopeful and beautiful story.
B007V4530A|3.0|Lots of good advice and examples of each advice from actual Ted Talks. Lots of information to digest. Take time read each section and think through each recommendation the author provides the reader.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|hi this app is reply good is fun to play with on the road or at home and is funny:)!
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I enjoyed this live version of the show! I highly recommend if you are a fan of classic Broadway performances.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|TWICE!!!!! Twice I have ACCIDENTALLY touched BINGO when trying to mark numbers in the bottom row!!  Can't they give a little more room at the bottom???
B008476HBM|5.0|As appropriate today as when it was written. A must read for everyone. We all have a little Pride and Prejudice in us even if we don't want to admit it.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|Pat Metheny has had a storied career.  He has often paired with other, sometimes lesser known artists to great effect.  THis cd illustrates the incredibly high production values he always puts forth.  Anna Maria Jopek, while very popular in Europe, is less well known in the US.  This is an excellent presentation of her excellent talent.  The Polish lullaby and Metheny's \\"Always and Forever\\" are high points.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Loved the quality of the DVD as well as the performances! Great purchase! Highly recommend if you are a les mis fan :)
0345803493|4.0|The plots do not leave you in suspense long enough, but they are worth the read for the sexy parts, I must say. Not gross at all, seriously. It is NOT pornographic, more \\"R\\" rated.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Awesome book with lots of information about India from 1984 to the present. This book follows two women--Kavita and Somer.  Kavita is an Indian woman whose husband goes into a rage when she gives birth to a daughter. He claims they can't afford a daughter (because of the dowry required to marry them when they are older). He takes the child away and has it killed. Heartbroken, when she becomes pregnant again, Kavita is determined that Jasu, her husband won't take another daughter away from her again. She gives birth alone and when she discovers it is another unwanted daughter, she has her sister help her get the baby to an orphanage in Mumbai, where she will have life. That is all she can give her.<br /><br />Somer is an American doctor who is infertile. Her and her Indian husband finally decide to adopt an Indian baby to fill the void in their life. They adopt Asha (Usha), Kavita's daughter. This is both Kavita's and Somer's stories...and Asha's when she grows old enough to question her origins and why her mother didn't want her.  Very poignant, with great detail about India and its many faces. I really loved this book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The movie exceeded all expectations, actually having a very in-depth and touching story as it goes on.  It's a story that all of mankind can relate to I think, and while moving in its own right; it also has plenty of funny moments for you and the kiddos.
1416550550|5.0|I loved this book.  It was full of twists and turns and kept you interested in the story.  It was really difficult to put down.
0345803507|4.0|It's a sexy book, of course. It was a super easy read and the 50 Shades books are not as nasty as media and others have made them out, but the story lines are not complex, sooo it is kind of a B- book series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy Solitaire. This is a nice version of the game that both my wife and I like to play.
B008Y70TMK|3.0|Ghostbusters for a old scare flick it was a ok movie but to compete in to days movie world it would need more scary seens in it and better specials effects but I still give it 3 stars for what entertainment I did get from it :)
0060531053|5.0|Being new to home brewing I sometimes find my self with more questions than answers.  This book has helped me answer a lot of those question.  The book is written so newbies can understand with feeling like a dumba**.  I can see myself going back to this book as I advance with home brewing
B0016BPWNM|5.0|The music, the costumes, and especially the scenery is magical. I loved this movie when I was a teen in the late 80's and my teen twenty years later loved it as much. she found it on her own.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I enjoyed the movie there were a couple of slow spots, you know the ending yet the movie continued to keep my interest. Its the type of movie you would like to see again later.
0062080237|5.0|This was quite a read. I had the wrong impression of Neil Gaiman but then one too many people pushed me to read it. I persevered through the first pages and then became so enthralled I kept sneaking time to read just a little more, just a little more. The story is so well put together that you have to admire that as a factor in itself, but the writing is also superb. The characters kept shape-shifting but there was always enough intrigue to persuade you to keep going. I recognize the old myths but the story spurred me to spend a little time internet searching to refresh myself and then admire the way Gaiman has reworked the myths. These are the big themes, romance, tragedy, war, life and degrees of death.<br /><br />This book is a literary achievement.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The best Batman redo. Too bad Heath Ledger died. This movie, the soundtrack, and action kept me on the edge of my seat. Awesome!
0345803485|4.0|Fun read. Remember the Lizzy Maguire Disney show where Hilary Duff has a cartoon in her head. The lead character, Anastasia, has a similar goofy person in her head. This is not porn.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I went on vacation and the hotel where we stayed had music piping through the room when we walked in. When it was time for sleeping my BF turned into sleeping bear beside me (nothing like hotel sleep & a long drive) so I decided to turn on the system to drown him out. Normally I do not like sound when I sleep BUT in this case more sound seemed like the only option to counter the wild animal snores. Well, it worked wonderfully and I was hooked on ambient noise from then on. I searched a few apps and found this to be the best. LOVE it! You can create custom sounds \\"arrangements\\" if you will. For example you can take a little \\"night\\" and mix with \\"seaside\\" and \\"white noise.\\"  It's like you're a bedtime DJ! You can also set a timer for how long it runs whether it be 10 mins or 4 hours.  Totally addicted! I sleep so much better with this as background noise. It helps me sleep by drowning out my boyfriends snoring and dulling the neighbors loud outdoor convos. Even better, it helps me relax and rest my busy mind at night. Long story short, it offers customization & relaxation. Works well on my kindle fire HD & my cell and I never have any problems w/the app.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great Movie!<br /><br />It gives credit to our intelligence services that is well deserved and often overlooked.  Excellent screenplay, and acting.
B000063V8R|5.0|This a great purchase for the TNG fan. My wife and I are both 'Trekkies' and have watched all seven seasons several times.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games... WOW! I love distopian society books. I read this within hours!! This is a great addition to a reading list.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is my new favorite book! Nicholas Spaks did a fantastic job writing this. You could feel the emotions portrayed in this novel.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The main problem with the film is that it did not establish any emotional tie with the main character. It was a dramatic recounting of events that seemed to rely more on tight editing for impact than anything else. It reminded me of the true-life TV movies they used to make.
B000062XFG|5.0|This a great purchase for the TNG fan. My wife and I are both 'Trekkies' and have watched all seven seasons several times.
B009LDMJBU|5.0|Excellent CD. The songs are fantastic. He has done it again. I love all his music. And, it is what I expected that only Eros would put out. You will not be disappointed.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I can always use more 'room' than what comes with my kindle!! :)  I just gotta find out HOW to use it!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game very much. It is challenging and fast paced and easy to do one or two of the levels at a time when you have a few minutes. I have the lowest priced (possibly free version -I don't remember now if I paid anything for it but if I did it wasn't very much) but I just wish that there were hints available on the levels. At least the higher, more difficult ones. If this is something available only on a higher priced version, I think that is wrong.<br />So now I am stuck at a level I can't get through and have run out of coins to get me through and it has just become frustrating.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|You can tell they want to make more of these half a story , moves slow seems like they tried to make it some what of a comedy , I didn't care for that all in all it was a disappointment . Probably won't go see the next one at the theater , I'll wait for dvd or instant download...
B001F5M9MG|5.0|This album was so rocking--I had to get it once I started seeing the band on MTV.  I love the band's personal style--how they made their thing their own and no one else's, and a lot of that came out in the music.  This is actually my second purchase of the same album--I have a kid who's a bit of a klepto with my favorite CDs, but that's ok.  She appreciates great music like the rest of us.
B008I6ZX1E|1.0|5 book set came with bent cover slips, and damage to binding of at least two books. None of the books come from the same edition, and have different cover designs, fonts, and spine texts. These are smaller issues, but if you're spending over $100 on a set of novels, they should all match. Not to mention the binding damage already present. Paper cover around spines has torn into gaps by the spines. A poorly bound, aesthetically displeasing grouping of mismatched books. Do not buy from this seller.
B000002OG5|4.0|Unlike other reviewers, I was looking specifically for the one song most associated with the movie. So I was really happy with the CD.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app downloaded easily and worked well right from the stat it made it a lot easier to us eBay on my kindle fire. i was well satisfied with this free app
B000WCDI64|5.0|She did a nice job at this concert, and she had one of the best bands ever behind her.  It wasn't too hard to tell that she was in a sense going through the motions doing the concert.  She was having fun, but I think you would have expected more out of her.  And at the end, the bio they filmed on her--that was wonderful to see.  You got to see her more relaxed with her family and friends, and we got to see her beginnings when the producers first heard of her and she went for her audition.  You should give this a try--I think you'll like it overall as I did.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|They continue to make new levels for the very fun, very addictive game. If you're addicted like I am, you'll play for hours on end.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I got this as a gift for someone because they liked the movie and they absolutely loved it. Actually bought another one.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|beautiful music and I love to listen to it... when in my car listening I can see the movie in my minds eye
B00632HWOG|5.0|This Yahoo mail app is fine.  It takes you right to your mail with no problem, except when it periodically asks you to sign in for security reasons.  My emails show up fine, and if I have to open something, there's no problem.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Just started. Seems ok. I hate writing reviews just because it's a quest goal, that's always kinda lame. Now I'm adding nonsense to reach the word minimum.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|come to find out I didn't need this and I wish it didn't come up as an option in the kindle store. I did however think I needed it at one time but then it didn't load. As it turned out, I got past the need for it. Waste of time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Have watched it once since seeing it on the big screen...love the movie, love the actors, love the music!! Will watch many more times I am sure.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|The one i received didn't work. I tried charging it but the light just stayed lit indicating it needed to be charged. I returned it without a problem. I'm disappointed that i could not even test it out.
0316044695|5.0|A great read from an intriguing author.  I find Luttrell's stories and outlook very intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who finds themselves living under the protection of people like Luttrell - it is hard to imagine our freedoms' cost without taking the time to understand people like this, unless you're willing to join them...
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Get Lucky simply makes you want to dance and stay in that Daft Punk universe indefinitely. Four more words required.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this app gives me so many different layouts for the tiles.  It also has a timer so I can try to do better each time.  I love the sounds and music it plays, also.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B0091W4IRY|4.0|While this is definitely a reinvention of Sherlock Holmes it is still a good story though. The essence of Sherlock Holmes is there with the scientific investigation, the attention to the details around him, and the use of disguises to sneak around looking for clues or getting surveillance. What I think is remarkable is that these techniques were considered new and innovative in the time the books were originally written and a lot of police departments in those days relied heavily on witnesses instead of any other evidence. I am disappointed that the movie had such a sense of finality to it. With this being the second movie I was hoping for a movie that was about Holmes foiling another plan of Moriarty or at least thinking he had him only to find out Moriarty was one step ahead. I think this movie should have been the fourth or fifth one, not the second.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I've been looking into this converter for sometime in order to connect my LG TV to the Bose Wave system. It wasn't completely necessary so I've delay the purchase until recently when my wife asked about watching the TV with the bluetooth headset I've recently bought her for her iPhone/iPad. When I've look into bluetooth transmitters most of them had analog 3.5mm connectors. So, I decided that it was time for me to take the jump and try out the converter.<br /><br />(BTW, this is partial copy/paste of the review I've written for TaoTronics bluetooth transmitter.)<br /><br />Here are the devices I wanted to connect:<br />* [[ASIN:B006ZH0KJS LG Cinema Screen 47LM6700 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses]]<br />* [[ASIN:B007ZCE4OO Wave® Music System III - Graphite Gray]]<br />* RunNYC Stereo Bluetooth Headphones ([...]) Here is the same headphone rebranded and sold on Amazon - [[ASIN:B0070UKBO8 MEElectronics Air Fi Runaway Bluetooth Stereo Wireless Headphones with Microphone (Black/Red)]]<br /><br />Here are the devices I've used to connect them:<br />* [[ASIN:B009346RSS FiiO TAISHAN-D03K Digital to Analog Audio Converter, 24-bit/192 kHz Support]]<br />* [[ASIN:B001TH7GSW AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable, 6 Feet]]<br />* [[ASIN:B004B8GF7Y TaoTronics TT-BA01 Wireless Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Transmitter (Not A Bluetooth Receiver) for 3.5mm Audio Devices (iPod, MP3/MP4, TV, Kindle Fire, Media Players...)]]<br /><br />I won't go into detail about how they are all connected since it's quite straightforward and obvious. One thing I do want to mentions is that Bose Wave is connected via RCA out and TaoTronic transmitter is connected to the 3.5mm out and they both work simultaneously. I was worried about whether I would need to constantly plug one in and the other out or not but thankfully the sound is delivered through both output simultaneously and this allowed me to keep them both plugged in at the sametime.
0316077046|4.0|Beautiful Darkness is a worthy sequel to Beautiful creatures. It is a rare series that can continue to build on itself in new and exciting ways. Many a series will become predictable before its end. This series avoids the trap of predictability adequately. On several occasions it is downright shocking. This sequal possesses more depth than the original.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love having this app on my phone and my Kindle Fire.  I can check Facebook wherever I am and as many times a day as I want.  I have not had any problems with the app. It loads fast.
0811879542|5.0|Our three year old loves this book and requests it at bedtime.  She laughs especially hard on the page where she blows on the dots and they seem to be falling off the page.  Its a really fun and funny book that makes both of us laugh out loud but is also a good learning tool for simple counting and basic colors.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I really loved this book.  I very much enjoyed her portrayal of Anne and Isabel and their Plantagenent husbands.  Excellent!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good time killer. I use this game when I have nothing else to do. It keeps me coming back for more all the time. Soo much to do....great app.
B000GY729M|2.0|I have one other CD of theirs, and there isn't one mediocre song on the album.  This CD is a large step down and wished I hadn't bought it.  I am still wanting to try other CD's by them.  One of a few of my favorite groups.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire original addition and my Samsung Galaxy  Stellar smartphone. I love it it works fantastic on both units I recommend it for those that would like to have something a little different to check time and set alarm clocks and sleep timers.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was really suspenseful and had very interesting plot twists and surprises.  I couldn't put it down. I particularly liked the portrayal of Vivien.  Well done, Kate Morton!
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I use it to take notes from bible study, easy to use and works great! Great app to have anytime.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great show and looks absolutely fantastic on our Sony. Would recommend this movie to anyone who likes adventure. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I'm not one to like musicals on the big  screen at all. I know my wife's love for music so I choose to take her to the movie theater on a date night. I loved it!  I choose to buy it when it came out on blue ray because it is a film worth owning!  My 4 kids like it as well. The message of forgiveness & redemption is incredible!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is long drawn out and very boring.  Also, the author thinks we are complete idiots and keeps repeating himself over and over again!
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I found the game kinda drab, there is no fun in it, it is nothing like tap fish, or any other fish game I have played.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I was hooked by it. I read it all. It is becoming very, very very painful. How many story arches can one endure before becoming totally lost? This is slowly moving for a climax for sure, but is probably 20 or more books from here....<br /><br />Not worth  the pain ,not enough of a reward at the end.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It is the most awesome movie that I have seen in quite a while.  I have watched it numerous times since I got it.
B005FFW46S|5.0|A true Pratchett classic. It entertains while providing subtle and not so subtle thoughts on slavery and what it means to be a person.
B005SLS3VY|5.0|As usual, I gobbled this book up, enjoyed every morsel. The characters are intriguing and well defined. Of course, my favourite is Harry Bosch - can't get enough of him. I just loved the eeriness of the scenes in the national park, and the room under the pier. Had me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good investigative yarn, with a perfect dose of nail biting thrown in. I give this book a five star rating, because, as usual Michael Connelly never fails to please!! Great value, I got this as an E book.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb does an outstanding job proving that knowledge does not have to be boring, drab or dull. He injects freshness and a good does of pragmatism into many, many fields. Very recommended reading it tickles your mind into a new better state!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have been using it for more than a month now and i can't be more pleased with it. It's elegant enough to use it in the job, and you can leave it for almost the entire weekend on it's own. Use it for at least an hour on Sundays to keep it on time.<br />I don't have any issues with time keeping, as other users mentioned,  it's accurate and keeps the time very well. I'm very happy an i would recommend it to anyone.
B005USZML4|3.0|This book was very well written, like all John Grisham books, but definitely for a younger audience.  Also, it was much shorter in length then most of his books.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Good app, no problems. Syncs with my facebook account. Not all the feature found on facebook (eg free spin). Good otherwise
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Not usually wanting to read this type of novel, however, I somehow thought it was more focused on a mystery. Apparently, my misread.  In any event, I did find it interesting, with the caution, to pay attention to the dates on each chapter as they switch back and forth.<br />It was an easy read and as the story progresses becomes more and more interesting with lots of twists and turns. I usally prefer something with more depth, however, with summer coming, it would be a good summer read.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It is a good game, but frustrating when it suddenly freezes and the tablet has to be completely turned off.  Good graphics on the android system.  I would recommend the game only if you don't mind the freezing.  Hopefully, the author will look into the problem and fix it.  Especially since it isn't free.
B0062LU85S|5.0|I love all things Twilight, I love all the movies and watch them over and over again, The product was  as stated, I will buy from again. Thank again :)
087033039X|4.0|This publication was informative and I'm doing better with my braiding.  I look forward to finding more books like this to assist me.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I haven't read a single book the was this honest and inspiring. I love the chapter entitled  I miss the mob. Quick read which makes even more enjoyable.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|So well written. As well as an entertaining story, it was interesting to follow the lives of the characters and how<br />their lives were affected by war.  Another book to make one think how futile war is, and how, is so many ways the majority of us just want to live peaceful lives, while being led by others to a different world.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun. It's very addicting. I love it. This game shad never stopped working on me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best game ever in the world. cant wayt to go back and play 101 in 1 games in a min.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a great book for the dogs perspective.  I listened to it on a trip and didn't want to stop the car.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Started on this game and didn't want to put it down.  So much fun but challenging.  If you aren't quick enough, the game ends!  I have become so addicted to this game, that I haven't played very many of my other downloaded games.  You just have to get this one-it's a winner!!  Love my Amazon.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Love this, great for family movie night.<br />I would also recommend Howl's Moving Castle.<br />Great story of love and family.
B007R41E8O|3.0|I'm enjoying the game so far, haven't finished yet. Graphics are crisp and clear. Music is creepy and howling wolf sound adds to the atmosphere. Things I don't like are no map which helps to figure out what you need to do and the constant \\"running around\\" from place to place just for another small piece to the final puzzle. No game is perfect and it is keeping me occupied. Enjoy!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|My wife really likes Bruno, so when the moma's happy, everyone is. I do enjoy his music also. Has a couple of hit songs on it also making it a plus.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|even though we knew the ending....it was great movie.  edge of your seat,  I would recommend this movie.  good flick
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The idea is scary and all but all you have to do is turn around till he is off the screen turn back and he is gone.  I beat it in like five minutes.
1844137872|5.0|I just started looking into Banksy items and this is a must have!!! It has ALL of his works!! Very awesome book! His works are very inspiring! Great book for the coffee table!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a well-written novel with well-developed characters.  While a sad tale it tells,  it, sadly, is completely realistic and one I highly recommend for the voluminous lessons that can be learned in how to treat others and better appreciate our own blessings.  A fine book!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|kind of predictable.  But ok.  I would recommend it, but not as my favorite movie by any means..  Just ok.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|I bought this for a friend and she loves it. Is now totally hooked. Although we don't believe these should be viewed by children under the age of at least 13.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|all I have to say is get it<br /><br />it is so cool best of all it is free awesome<br />get it
B006S08RLU|5.0|Ha!  This was a beautiful and thought provoking film.  I was behind the times in never having seen it until now.  I know where the Travelling Gnome Idea was hatched for the famous Travelocity commercials!  I identified with the main character in a profound way, and the humor made the movie well worth the watch.  I defenitely recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.
B003NTMREM|3.0|I like SciFi stuff. One of the advantages of a Roku with Prime and Netflix, I can try most of them.<br /><br />I will admit, Torchwood was a slow start for me. I would watch an episode and not find it too interesting. The shows seemed kinda cheesy. After several attempts, it finally got my attention. Mid first season, character development really improves, the writing gets better and some of the cheesiness declines.<br /><br />Capt. Jack is somewhat irritating at first. He gets less irritating as the show progesses. Also, if you are offended my gay male leads, then you might want to skip this series. However, I think the episode regarding his namesake, where they kissed, was well done. It was one of the best episodes of season one. At the conclusion of season one, the character of Capt. Jack seems to be the biggest negative distraction to the series for me. I am not sure why, he seems almost transparent and does not come across well. His character improves in a few episodes, then the mannequin type acting restarts. Maybe this is one of the side effects of not being able to die.<br /><br />The other characters do a fine job. No problems.<br /><br />Some of the 'monsters' have this bad Halloween costume type appearance. Thankfully, these do not dominate the series.<br /><br />When it comes to mysteries and crime dramas, the UK produces some of the best, if not the best. When it comes to SciFi type shows, the UK puts much less effort into the quality. This spinoff of the Dr. Who series could have been much better done. The writing and special effects are lacking and those accustomed to the US produced SciFi shows will probably be somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />The first season gets three stars. Not the best but not bad. The last half of the season is by far the better half. I hope season two continues this improvement and turns out to be at least a four star season.<br /><br />The first three seasons of Torchwood are included with Prime. Season four is not. Season four has ten episodes that cost $2.99 each. So, $30 for season four. Also, Netflix deleted season four for some reason.our has ten episodes that cost $2.99 each. So, $30 for season four.

B00CDSVZHY|1.0|First time amzn video was not at all HD quality. I had to buy it from cable co. & watch.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I don't think my opinion is really needed here since there are already so many customer reviews, but I will say this:<br />I started watching this DVD on Saturday night, thinking I would watch about an hour and then wait until a later time to finish viewing.  I was up all night, not only watching the entire DVD, but searching related items.  I have never seen the staged production and I was thrilled by this performance.  The cast could not have been better.  The DVD contains the tribute at the end of the performance.  It was good to see Colm Wilkinson, whom I like a lot.  I am now making plans to see the show, and I am researching obtaining a copy of the production with the French singing.  I have seen some of the French on Youtube, and it was wonderful to hear the rich voice of my beloved Damien Sargue.  This DVD will be a welcome item to your collection.  I was surprised and pleased by it.  Enjoy it, as I will for a long time to come.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My grandson has a great time with this app.  I would recommend it to anyone from 1 1/2 to 3.  Easy puzzles, noisy and fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love it I love it and my husband loves it we even do family challenges to see who gets the most coins least coins points ect..
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was a great read, the story kept moving and twisting in some unexpected ways. The main character struggles to keep her personal demons in check while putting together a story about murders in the hometown she would prefer to forget. I would definitely recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Entertaining book. Not great prose but the pace is good and keeps you turning pages. Not as interesting or as creative as the first two books. I'd rate it lower were it not for the preceding volumes. Still, I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is totally awesome you should get the game right away now do it now come on do it ok I'm done so it is awesome you get it now plz
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This story has such a different curve found in an action thriller!! Intermingling the FBI and civilian conspirious group called the Camel Club.The Club stumbles upon a crime, the FBI investigates, the group and the FBI meet.  The Club are not all amatures. Each have their own gifts and their own mental issues.  Together they might pull it off.  I would'nt want to give the story away.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The event is exciting as is -- doesn't need the overhype -- should have concentrated on the facts available instead of making it up.
B00BI745AA|1.0|This is a 2 1/2 hour movie that was thoroughly enjoyable. The music, characters and storyline are intriguing and wonderful.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|Not the usual mahjong but I find it intriguing. Works great on my Samsung tablet.  If you like 'pass the time' kind of games, you'll enjoy this.
B0000026NC|5.0|The remastering is very good, the sound quality remains intact compared to my old vinyl and improved sound quality without losing the excellent result from analog records. It was very gratifying to hear Pink Floyd in an enhanced format.
B002KS1IJC|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. It's worth the time and money. The barbarian tribe aspect was realistic and there was plenty of action. The film was shot with that moody darkness and color that is just off enough to add to the environment.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Darker and more dramatic than most Bond movies, but still has flair.  Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are fantastic; a couple of the other performances are only so-so.
B00966TN1Q|2.0|I usually read the books from the beginning to the end even if I'm not liking it . This was the case . I read the book but I have to say that is boring with too many details and with the story running too slow .
B003PIUC02|4.0|[...]    I'm not one to watch TV shows.  At least, not when a whole season has an all-encompassing plotline.  The wait for new episodes, likelihood of being absent when it airs (even the re-runs) and a lack of engagement due to commercials all put me off.  However, a recent offering brought me to the first season of Spartacus, which I remember seeing commercials for and merely being disinterested.  The show's pilot episode didn't necessarily help matters, either.  But I kept watching.    Before long the entire season was conquered and, save a few select points, the show truly impressed me.  Something that people note in TV shows they keep returning to is how the episodes end (cliffhangers?).  While only a couple episodes here end on a true cliffhanger, most of them end in a way that either reinforces what's been alluded to, thickens the plot, or both.    It's a good thing the show was quick to pick up, because if I'd watched the pilot episode on TV, more cheesily graphic content would be the only thing to make me return.  Character development is almost as dry as the setting, at first, but around the second and third episodes things begin to change.  Eventually, the plot becomes very involved, characters begin showing depth, and trust from the audience is built before being spit back in their faces, much like the characters.    When I say this, I mean it in the best possible way.  The show becomes increasingly involved, with surprises (many times betrayals) making diversions less and less likely.  Praise must be made to a number of actors in the show too, with John Hannah being my personal favorite (guarantee I'll never watch The Mummy the same way again).  It's also a shame to hear about what happened to Andy Whitfield.  He wasn't the strongest player in the show, but he really embodied the role of Spartacus, thanks in no small part to his voice.    It's tough to cover all bases of the show in a concise manner.  So, to recap (see what I did there?), I'll make noteof the parts which stood out to me, per episode.    The Red Serpent: Setting up very one-dimensional characters, especially the Romans.  The best justice this episode does is prepare audiences for the show's graphic nature.  Taking only this episode into account, I'd tell you \\"one episode in and they already killed my favorite character.\\"    Sacramentum Gladiatorum: The introduction of Varro is a welcoming one, as is Doctore, another favorite character of mine.  I like that the show doesn't go for the he's-different-so-he-doesn't-need-training routine.  The pace here is slow, but not without reward.    Legends: This is where the character development begins to truly take hold, and the end of the episode holds an eye-catching surprise.  The idea of method-versus-purpose is what stood out to me.    The Thing in the Pit: Here's the episode which truly begins to realize the show's potential.  This is also where the violence and gratuity start to seem most justified.  The last few minutes push me to that oh-crap-what's-going-to-happen feeling I'm sure all of us know.  And just imagine if we weren't being misled...    Shadow Games: A side plot begins to unravel while a certain romance unfolds, one which I have absolutely no emotional stake in.  For an episode which holds a key stepping stone for one of the characters, it certainly didn't stick out, aside from said point.    Delicate Things: This episode made me think \\"what's going to happen now?\\" until a certain quote was spoken at the end.  It becomes clear that the end of the season isn't going to bring personal satisfaction as much as it will retribution.  A few more details of Doctore's character only make me like his character (the way he's written) even more.    Great and Unfortunate Things: Here we see the influence of power and coercion on our characters, with both Varro and Spartacus finding themselves at ends.  Again, loving the scenes with Doctore.    Mark of the Brotherhood: A bit more of the side plot comes into play here, with Ilithyia continuing to prove her deplorable nature.  As one of the characters says, she's a serpent in human form.    Whore: Now there's a fitting episode title if I ever knew it.  True colors for various characters come through, thickening the plot, including a twist that, though predictable, is great to see unfold.  And a certain female character is introduced.  Gee, I wonder what potential she'll have?  What with those pretty eyes and that attractively pitiful facial expression.    Party Favors: Talk about pissing me off for the right reasons.  This episode has probably the most emotional moment of the entire season for me, one that I'm still clenching my fist at the thought of.  Once again, the power of power is in full display.    Old Wounds: Some of these titles are simply genius, with a seemingly random scene actually bearing significant fruit to the season's conclusion.  It almost becomes contrived, as if an example of deus ex machina, but this is carefully (and thankfully) avoided.    Revelations: Definitely my favorite episode of the season, this is where the tension and colors of everyone starts coming to light.  And yet more meat is added to an already dense plot.  As far as I'm concerned, THIS episode is the true payoff of the show.    Kill Them All: This episode has three flashbacks, all of which feel out of place with the show's style; it's really distracting.  Maybe it would be tough to weave them into previous episodes, but it makes the larger chunk of the episode feel clunky.  That said, our finale does hit pretty high scales, and despite an abrupt finish, we get satisfaction and are still left with the longing for further retribution.    So yes, taking the first season into account, you can consider me a fan.    [...]
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is lots of fun. You meet a lot of nice people. It is very addicting. I play it everyday
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game for hand eye coordination.  I like to beat the monkeys.  It is a challenge to not fall off!
B009AMANBA|1.0|I found this movie to be slow, slow, slow and dark.  Very disapointed since it had such rave reviews.  The acting was great, Daniel Day Lewis can do no harm in my eyes, but I think Sally Field should  have won the Oscar for her performance of Mary Lincoln which could not have been easy.  We have so much arguing among the politicians in our present time, it did show that even then, Democrats & Republicans couldn't get along.  I fast forwarded a lot of the film.  A big disappointment for me.  I like to see a movie and then be able to discuss it with others.  This one I could not find I wanted to discuss very much except to voice my disappointment.  Have seen other Lincoln movies that I was more impressed with.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|I like the movie, it's been about 15 years since I've seen it last.  Watched it with my 13 year old son this time.  He liked it too.  We both thought it was a little slow at times.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|The book was riveting, whereas this film was not.  There were many things in the book, also, that were not in the movie.  It was well presented but a lot less than what I expected
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Since my mom passed away I felt lost.  Thanks to Anita Moorjani's experience, I understood many things I already felt were true.  Her honest, hearfelt and compassionate story helped me overcome my grief.  Thank you Anita for teaching me how to live fearlessly!!!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Since watching the movie, I just had to have it.  From the special effects to the acting by the young men playing Pi, what a movie enjoyed every minute of it.  Brave to all involved in the making of this film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! A lot of depth added to the story and characters. Can't help but hear and see the actors from the first movie as I read it, but that makes it a little more interesting and fun to get through.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|If you are looking for something different, and you love flowers, this is a book for you.  If you are like me and you  like protagonists that are nice and lovable, and in trouble through no fault of their own sweet self, don't worry your pretty little head over this one.  This is a woman in trouble that did some things I really didn't like, and the question is will she grow and change or continue her miserable ways?  Very unusual for me, I usually don't like books if I don't like the main character.  If you read it you will have to decide, as I did, by the end,  if you like her or not.
B00004S8J4|1.0|4/22/13. After ordering this product over 2 months ago, I finally got around to attempting to watch it last night. I was not able to view Glengarry Glen Ross at all, because at the beginning of the movie, a prompt came up in a red box on the screen.  It said: Regional Code required. We tried to change some coding from the menu but were not able to put in a regional code, nor was such a thing available. Have never seen that prompt prior to watching any DVD  movie.  I'm looking for a full refund or another Glengarry Glen Ross movie to be sent to me soon. You can contact me at cindy-peterson@sbcglobal.net.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game to play. It gets harder as you accumulate more coins and move to the next level. I would definately recommend this app if you like playing games on your Kindle or android.
1449410243|3.0|I love *LOVE* love The Oatmeal and was excited for this book. I read all of his posts on his page, share them on Facebook, and have ordered a couple of things from his website. Naturally, I ordered this book. However, I was disappointed overall because there really wasn't enough extra content to justify paying for it when the online comics are free. I'm not sorry I supported someone I consider to be great talent, but I don't think I'd buy it again.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Excellent quality and a great movie about the events surround thing 13th Ammendment!  I would recommend to anyone to watch this!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Between the Khaleesi Danaerys Targaryen, all the false kings, and The Others and Wildlings at the wall, you will never stop reading. I was completely immersed in this book. The twists and turns, conniving and plotting, and the underhanded tactics of the characters have me aching for more. On to book four!
B008602KQI|4.0|Movie was okay, I hadn't read the book so I didn't really know what to expect.  I was not happy with the fact that the ending left you knowing that a planned sequel was already in the works, I wish there would have been more closure.
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Fun, exciting entertaining! Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu were great, as well as the supportng cast members! I'd recommend this movie!
1609611543|5.0|I found this book very interesting. The author gives good explanation for his view that wheat is causing many health problems including obesity. He shows why and how the wheat we have today is different from what we used 50 and more years ago. I won't know if he is right until I have tried his advice for a period of time, but I believe it is very credible and plan to give it a try. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to get to the root of the problem and to understand the cause of health symptoms rather than to just treat the symptoms themselves. Not exactly light reading, but very well explained in terms laymen can understand.
0792838912|5.0|Here's an intro to BDSM- M/s from back in the 70's that created such an uproar back then, long before 50 Shades made the NY Times best seller list. If you are curious or enjoy the lifestyle, this is a classic...
B00BAVCD8A|2.0|The title of this review is not to say that this album took the regrettable path of Folie a Deux, because, frankly, it didn't. It did not because there was absolutely nothing regrettable about Folie a Deux.<br />Instead, the title derives from the fact that the madness of the modern music industry has imposed itself upon Fall Out Boy; that the overproduction, cliches, and lack of creativity so widespread in the fingers of label executives and spitting heads has wormed its way into a band once fresh.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this extended metaphor is not merely inserted to be referential of a past work; it is truly the only way to describe Save Rock and Roll.<br /><br />I've heard numerous people say - including, if I recall correctly, the band themselves - say that Fall Out Boy has matured during their time away. However, nothing could be more false. While Folie a Deux had brilliant lyricism, a confident but not cocky set of vocals & guests, and inspiring instrumentation of a wide variety, Save Rock and Roll has...well...<br /><br />Nothing. Nothing, save for generic measures and typical beats.<br /><br />The two singles released before the album dropped (The Phoenix and My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark) are rare deviants from the path of monotonous pop blare on the record, with slightly more than minimal investment on the part of the band (the latter of the two actually sounds great acoustic), and the title track with Sir Elton John is enjoyable at times. However, these are the only notable moments of positivity - two and a half songs of \\"meh\\" to a majority of either \\"skip\\" or \\"ugh.\\" Alone Together and Where Did The Party Go will make any FOB fan outright cringe, while the next five tracks are filled with dull moments and poorly executed guest appearances. Big Sean flat out ruins any potential for The Mighty Fall, Foxes doesn't add anything to Just One Yesterday, and Courtney Love's fifteen seconds of shame on Rat a Tat reduce the song to another celebrity-cash-in track. Even Ryan Ross's stealthy guitar guest spot on Infinity on High added more than these.<br /><br />By no means could this album please everybody after the hiatus, but with tracks that seem written for the radio and not the fan, I fail to see how it pleases anyone.<br /><br />Not even Elton John could salvage the remains of rock and roll from this album. If this is how we're saving rock, then we may as well say our goodbyes now.
0345529057|5.0|The author's depth of presentation is amazing! This is a great accompaniment to the DVDs, despite slight differences between the two.
0802473156|5.0|I was very impressed by this book.  I believe every marriage would be happier if the couple knew the secrets that this book describes,and especially marriages that are shaky could be saved.

0723259674|3.0|I had wanted the classic small set which looks like the picture. What I received was larger but with the Beatrice Potter art work so I kept them.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|I learned about Ludovico Einaudi from watching this \\"The Mountain\\" [...] - well worth your time to watch the video.  I am extremely thrilled with Ludovico's works and this album; he is an incredible musician.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story! Easy read! this was an easy bedtime read, great for sitting by the pool and relaxing in the sunshine!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I played Samurai vs Zombies 1 and loved it and now we have #2.  I enjoy this game because you have to use your wits and each level is pretty quick so you can pick it up, play for a bit and if you get interrupted it's not a big deal.  I like the graphics of S vs Z.  The one thing I do not like that stopped me from giving it 5 stars was the whole deal with having to use real money to buy pixels.  You would be able to move a lot faster and easier  through the game if you purchased some items.  Seems like this game should not have in app purchases since you have to think of strategies.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It's good for downloading music, but not videos. My sister wanted to watch a movie... but it wouldn't download. Probably because of the length. It's still an awesome app! :)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is one of those books you will tell your friends about, encourage them to read, and never forget.  As explained in the book, though it was fiction, it was based on some actual events that happened in Ireland at that time.  This made the story even more memorable to me.<br /><br />One thing that sets this book apart from other books, is that the two main characters were not perfect on the outside, nor inside. So many times an author only presents main characters that are tall, dark, and handsome, (if you know what I mean).<br /><br />Another part about this book that kept me laughing was all the old Irish sayings.<br /><br />This book will make you laugh, cry, so mad you could scream, and ever ready to see what is going to happen next.  The ending was wonderful, though not what I expected exactly.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a wonderful read!
1844488748|5.0|The book has excellent directions for ribbon worked flowers....especially the roses. I also signed up for her periodic emails featuring her and her students latest work.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I had the app for about a year and it was working fine then I got the upgrade and it was working perfect until today I was playing on it then it started being weird and now it is saying do u want to this problem and I tried hitting the send button and it didn't do anything and I cant play on it but it was awesome why'll it lasted. :-(
B005LAIII0|5.0|A great movie that demonstrates character and indurance.  The family relationship and obedience to parents is a fine example to follow.  The movie is even better the second and third time.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|4-22-13 -- This app has many options and I expected it to be hard to navigate, but to my surprise I found it very intuitive and a snap to program.  The alarm part seems to be only in military time, but this is fine with me as it is more efficient and easy to learn.  Being retired I need to organize my time, and the number of alarms you can set appears to be unlimited, so now I have no excuse to forget exercising, medicine, appointments, phone calls, chores, or anything.  The developer must be very clever and I don't know how they do it.  Good job.  I just started using this app after running across it as \\"free app of the month\\" while browsing, and have found no problems with it, but will update if necessary.
B000002U9W|5.0|Frankly, I'm surprised a disc as old as this one is in such great shape. There is not a scratch on it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I understand that this book was probably written mainly for the shock value, but it is hard to get past the poor writing.  Harlequin romances are likely much better.
B000I9YWDO|1.0|not funny, waste of time, I can't belive I paid for this they should pay me to watch it, wow
B005MSD6QU|5.0|I love this show.  There are just so many seasons and I have seen so many epidodes on tv, that I don't know which ones I haven't seen and I don't want to pay for shows I have seen.  But it's a great show and keep you wondering.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best Book Ever I couldn't put it down can't wait to read the last one so excited for the adventure
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I was disappointed by this book -- it felt more like a soap opera than a book.  Have enjoyed his other books much more.
B009AMANH4|2.0|I nearly fell asleep watching this movie.Not what I expected at all. The picture and sound quality not very good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was a doubter of this series.  However, after seeing it was free with Amazon Prime I decided to check it out.  I wasn't disappointed.  Now I'm just trying to decide when I'll purchase Season 3!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the size of the cards, easy to see.  Like the auto finish makes it go faster.  Don't like that I can't close out in middle of a game.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I enjoy playing this in my down time and when I am sitting in waiting rooms for appoints. It is quick and can be challenging at times.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A light hearted and at times very funny book to read.<br />If he had completed everything that he did in the book<br />Im sure he would be well over 100years old. I would recommend

0807014273|5.0|Review of `Man's search for meaning', by Viktor E. Frankl published by Beacon Press, Boston in 2006.<br /><br />CITATION: Frankl, V. E. (2006). Man's search for meaning. Boston: Beacon Press.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr William P. Palmer<br /><br />This edition of `Man's search for meaning' contains a foreword by Harold S. Kushner, a preface to the 1992 edition, Frankl's experiences in several concentration camps, which is the main autobiographical section, logotherapy in a nutshell, the 1984 postscript and an afterword by William J. Winslade.<br /><br />Frankl had thought out the basic ideas of his philosophy of psychology prior to his imprisonment in German concentration camps during the second world war. However his experiences in the concentration camps deepened his philosophy. His terrible experiences during his imprisonment and his reactions to them, are deeply moving and are very well described. The quality of Frankl's writing is excellent.<br /><br />I found the description of logotherapy less convincing, but overall, although it is only a short book (165 pages), it tugs at the heart-strings, whilst remaining intellectually rigorous.<br /><br />BILL PALMER
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun for all ages and will have addicted before you know it. Hurry and get this free game and enjoy relaxing while playing many older games.

B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Much of the time Games made into movies dont turn out well.  But this was pretty cool.  However if your not a fan of the Halo game its might be more so so since knowing a bit of history from the game makes this more fun to watch.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Never a dull moment. Pendergast  is so different from the usual protagonists, you have to love him! If you like Sherlock Holmes, you'll Love  Pendergast.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Fun to play, it flows very well. a little slower on Wi-Fi . Graphics are clean and crisp.  It's a little frustrating to get a stronger deck together. All and all it will suck you in if you like this type of game.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|I saw the original Mechanic with Charles Bronson.  Was pretty good.  At least I still think so been a long time since i seen it.  This movies was pretty cool.  Actions, Life of an a specialized assassin.  Kind of a Macguyver version assassin.  Anyway interesting show to watch.
B00000889Y|4.0|A compilation released in 1987 that does include certain more difficult-to-find songs. Some versions however are truly awful, some brilliant, so, briefly, not my favourite, but a Cramps album anyway.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am truly enjoying this soundtrack, I can put it in and just let it play. Its not my normal taste in music but ive got it in my car and its very relaxing music driving home after work, I live out in the country and listening to the music kinda throws me into the movie as so much of the film was in the forrest. I highly suggest this for ANY twilight fan, or anyone that can appreciate some good artist.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Downer stories with odd twists at the end<br />Very unlike the Bosch short stories that are good<br />unsympathetic people, who cares
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I read this after seeing the movie (out of curiosity more than anything else...I wanted to see if the similarity with Battle royale stemmed from the book or the movie).<br />It's an entertaining read, but is definitely aimed at young adults. The writing style is, at times, overly simplistic with the writer appearing a little lazy, but the speed at which you can read the book makes getting over this easy enough.<br /><br />Read if you're looking for an easy read that wont take up much of your time.
B00005JL1C|4.0|But i remember it being so much better when it was new, it could be that ive just gotten older ?  Its a pretty good 80's love triangle flick,  Im glad i own it and i will watch it again, im just a little disapointed that it didnt delight me the way it did back in the day.. oh well.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Short stories excellent format for Bosch who would otherwise be too old<br />A general problem with protagonists from the 1960-1970's
B0001XAPX8|1.0|I had wanted to rent or buy this movie for some time, especially since Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman were in it. I don't remember hearing too much about it when it came out originally and, after seeing it per chance on TV a few days ago, I know why. Despite of many glowing reviews here, this movie did not work for me on several levels.<br />1. Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman were totally miscast in this film, Ms. Kidman more so. She was so unbelievable as the out and down cleaning woman. This part needed a true character actress, like a young Meryl Streep or Susan Sarandon.<br />2. The dialogue seemed wooden and contrived to me, as well as the sexual tension between the two.<br />3. The flashbacks made the movie feel choppy, even though I really liked the actor that played the younger Coleman very much.<br />I would recommend this movie as a rental only.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This Blue Ray has a fantastic transfer !  Im a fan of these movies and the pleasure of watching them on BR is a true treat ! The combo pack has all three movies and comes in a nice tri-fold box set.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Megan and Conner have many situations that cause both themselves an  the reader to laugh.  They also have moments  where they and I were both thinking they needed to get in touch with their present feelings and stop being hung up on the past.  Finally they figured out what they relativity lack and need.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Genova's telling of this story from the Alzheimer patient's point of view is brilliant. The reader follows Alice's thoughts as they become more and more convoluted, then learns exactly how skewed her perception of reality has become when other characters reveal the truth or when Alice herself has heartbreaking moments of clarity -- it's the ultimate \\"show, don't tell.\\" Very, very sad but very, very good.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|Ive been buying up the twilight soundtracks when i can get a deal on them and have not bought them in a particular order, at the moment i have twilight, new moon, Breaking dawn 1 & Breaking dawn 2 soundtracks (only missing Eclipse) With that said i can let all the other soundtracks play with very little skipping and enjoy the music, and Breaking Dawn 1 is'nt awfull, but it doesnt capture me like the others do. Ive also learned that there are repeat songs (a thousand years for example) on the last two soundtracks and there are different versions of the same song as well, I feel like this is a bit of a letdown.  I wont say this is a bad album as its not, its just not as good as the first two.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Neat cg. Good plotline. Left it open for sequels and yet you felt it finished well. Left you with a feeling of satisfaction.
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|Howdy ho fello Amazonians!! (or iz it amazonans LOL)???? I love movies almost as much as I love good music like the Jonas Brothers but these days there have been many new releases that just STINK.  For example, Juno Unchained is a movie about a lot of racialisms....I thought President Obama ended slavery in 2008??<br /><br />Anywho, the guy Juno is a slave that is forced to go around riding on a horse to kill people... Violence is bad. Isn't it ironic that shortly after this film is released... that we have the terrorist in Boston and then the Marshmallow plant in Waco Texas blow up.......i smell a conspiracy here.... There is just too much profanity in this movie and the ended violence was just despicable!! how does crap like this win the best film of the 2012 award?? I really don't know!!<br /><br />Your best bet is just to stay away from controversial films like Juno UnChained and watch good movies like Battlefield Earth, Honey I shrunk the kids part 5, Freddy Got Fingered, and anything with Kim Kardashian (Disaster Movie was great!). =] so long cowboyz...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|My new favorite book! A must read book! Just amazing! It may be old but a great book, to read!

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have been putting off watching this movie and started it several times before finally watching it to the end.  I really enjoyed the movie - the friendship and betrayal and then the coming together at the end.  I'm going to watch it again.<br />Mollie

B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|It's a great game, teaching it to new players takes just a couple of minutes, and playing it is very fast and fun. Ideal for when you're waiting for a large group of people to show up, and you want to play something while you wait for the rest.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't read the trilogy looking for Toni Morrison or Maya Angelou. I expected a story with explicit sex scenes and I got it! Mission very well accomplished. I must say I miss reading about Christian and Anastasia's exploits now that I have finished the last book. In the words of Oliver Twist, \\"may I have some more please?\\"

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I accidentally hit the 'But With One Click' on Season 2. I do not want to buy it!!! In fact, I had already watched the whole season for free. Now I can't figure out how to un-buy it. Or return it. Or whatever. I have figured out how to turn off the 'One Click' thing thank goodness. Anyone have advice???? Where the heck is a customer service link???<br /><br />Since this is in the review section - It's a great show and I really like it a lot. I just don't care to watch something more than once.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fantastic story . I can't wait for the last of the trilogy.  The final story should be as good as the last two.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this novel. I noticed all of the bad reviews but I'm confused: YOU KNEW WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT PRIOR TO YOUR PURCHASE, DID YOU NOT? Maybe you shouldn't read a book about a subject that doesn't interest you - or don't purchase a book you know nothing about - that's plain foolish! This story is a fun, quick-paced, wildly amusing, fantasy romance that explores (mildly) the world of BDSM fetishes. If the thought of getting playfully spanked on your behind as part of sexual foreplay sounds enticing to you, you'd probably enjoy this book. If that prospect is more than your mind can handle, stick with what you're used to but don't attack the author's writing skills out of ignorance -- this book wouldn't be a NY Times BESTSELLER if the author sucked.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a fantastic movie needs all the support it can get. NPH is amazing! Can't wait for next one
142311339X|5.0|book came on time, in good condition! this book was very well written and the story is exciting and adventurous. I was a little disappointed that Percy wasn't in this book, but after reading a couple of chapters I was hooked and I couldn't wait to find out what happened to Percy. I recommend reading the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series before you read this series, so everything will make better sense.
B0087IT8LO|4.0|It is a really fun and sad movie, all of that in only one movie. I love it. Will watch it again and again.

B009PJ1Q82|2.0|There's little redemption in this film that follows the failed relationship between two 30-something men over roughly a 10 year period.  As I watched the movie, I kept hoping it wouldn't did any deeper into a well of isolation, abuse and co-dependency, but it just kept going deeper.  While many can relate to some level of difficulty in a relationship, this throws so many issues into the mix, you can't help but ask why either one of the characters stay?  It is an essay in co-dependent relationships, and that is the only redeeming value in the film.  I couldn't connect with either of the two main characters, which didn't help the plight of the film.  On one hand, you have Erik, an aspiring artist / filmmaker who is somewhat sex addicted and completely dependent upon his lover Paul.  To the extent he watches as Paul has sex with a stranger while high on drugs.  Paul is identified as an attorney, who has a drug addiction and falls off the wagon after going for treatment in Minnesota.<br /><br />While the topics are relevant to some, the acting was not superb, and the film is a dark abyss of chaos and abuse. Trust me, I would be supportive of a partner with a drug issue, but I also would be smart enough never to start a relationship with someone who already has one, as Erik does in this story.  I would not recommend or watch again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book really surprised me, it was that good ! Enjoyed it very much from the very beginning to the very end.
B009AMANBA|2.0|The problem I had with this film is that it's not about president Abraham Lincoln, but about the ratification of the 13th amendment. Based on the title, I expected to learn more about Lincoln's humble beginnings while growing up, and what, if anything, in his life motivated him to want to become president. Instead, sadly, like many movies of today, it was politically clothed in deception. I will have to see a lot more previews and read more reviews before I watch any more so called \\"block busters\\" and \\"5 star reviews\\". I gave it 2 stars only because of the superb acting by Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field, not the content of the film.
B008M7JODC|3.0|I'm all for pseudo science and fun TV/movie science. But this show, as with many other similar shows, tries too much to blur the lines between reality and fiction. And that is where it breaks down for me. Too often they break real physical laws in an unconvincing or insufficient way.<br /><br />The acting is okay. The plots are ridiculous. The extremely good/bad/mysterious people are laughable. This leaves me with the kind of show I may turn on in the background, but it isn't worth devoting my attention to.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Miles is only a bit player in this book. In 'Civil Campaign' Ivan started coming into his own and now really comes to life.<br />The book is a good read, as are nearly all of Bujold's works, and I recommend it highly.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Very good movie. He carried the weight of the entire world on his shoulders and he was still a loving individual
B006PTL1QM|4.0|\\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a movie that disserved by its trailer -- it looked like a movie that focused on Carl Jung having an affair with a masochistic mental patient. Well, yes, that does happen. But David Cronenberg's movie is less about the love affair and more about Carl Jung's fraying friendship with Sigmund Freud, and Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender give exquisite performances. Sadly, Keira Knightley isn't up to their level.<br /><br />Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) is incarcerated at a Swiss mental hospital, where she is psychoanalyzed by Carl Jung (Fassbender) -- and soon he is able to pinpoint the cause of her masochistic sexual behavior. Soon she's not only acting normally, but is studying to become a doctor herself.<br /><br />Pleased by her progress, Jung speaks about her to the eminent Dr. Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), who views Jung as a surrogate son and heir to his well-regarded theories. At the same time, Jung continues working professionally with Sabina as she develops her own psychoanalytic theories -- and the two of them develop a passionate attraction.<br /><br />Jung initially is reluctant to cheat on his loyal, beautiful wife. But after a sex-addicted psychoanalyst (Vincent Cassel) exhorts Jung to follow his urges, he falls into a passionate affair with Sabina. This throws a monkey wrench not only into his personal life, but it begins to interfere in his friendship with Freud -- and as Jung insists on following his own theories about myth and archetypes, his friendship with Freud begins to fall apart.<br /><br />It takes a director as brilliant as David Cronenberg to not only get a movie like this made and released in theatres, but to keep it from becoming dull. Most of \\"A Dangerous Method\\" is made up of conversations about the human mind and how it works, slowly showing the audience that psychoanalytic theories are not really about the patient -- they are all about the shrinks and how THEY see the world.<br /><br />And yet Cronenberg makes every scene, every conversation feel intense and sometimes passionate, no matter how dry the subject matter is. He makes you feel the intense passion of Jung and Sabina as they natter about their theories, contrasted to the rigid condescension of Freud. Things are intense even in a funny scene where Freud exhorts Jung to talk about kinky sexual practices at the dinner table.<br /><br />And while Jung's sexual/intellectual affair with Sabina is important, the most important relationship here is the friendship with Freud and Jung, which flowers briefly before slowly decaying. Fassbender and Mortensen are absolutely spellbinding here -- one is a uncertain but passionate doctor who is seeking to explore new terrain in the human mind, and the other is an older, more entrenched man who refuses to explore different theories.<br /><br />But Keira Knightley was not the right actress for this part -- she's not subtle enough to go toe-to-toe with Mortensen and Fassbender. Any displays of emotion look cartoonish and exaggerated, with her twitching and yo-yoing jaw. Even in the scenes where Sabina is composed, she feels over-the-top compared to the others.<br /><br />\\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a very cerebral, \\"talky\\" movie, but it also is a powerful look back at the men and women who created psychology as we know it today. And while Knightley is embarrassing, Fassbender and Mortensen are astounding.ery scene, every conversation feel intense and sometimes passionate, no matter how dry the subject matter is.

B001DM1VXE|1.0|What a bunch of pretentious hooey.  This stinker ranks right up there with \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\".  If they spent $60,000 on this unmitigated piece of crap they deserve a wedgie a day for life.  Think of all the good that kind of money could do; like cleaning dog feces off the sidewalk.  And, I must say, that for all those air headed dimwits that took it seriously, GET A LIFE!  I'd have rather had my nads pounded flat with a wooden mallet than have watched this complete waste of film.  To say it was bad would be high praise.

B008JFUO36|5.0|[THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL VERSION.]<br /><br />\\"Jack Harper: 60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the \\"mop-up crew\\".<br /><br />If you want to see a fun film with romance, excitement, plausible futuristic inventions, weaponry and computer-control, complete with Big Sister and the apparent salvation of the human race, watch this film.<br /><br />The film's beginnings concern an apocalypse of sorts, where in 2017 Man won, at a terrible cost, a war with an alien invasion. The remnants of that war, fought by the alien Scavs, want Jack (Tom Cruise) but not to kill him but to capture him.<br /><br />The cloud condo (I like to call it) has everything, complete with swimming facilities, showers, food and a hot red-headed, Brit-accented woman (Victoria) who also happens to be Jack's lover and communications officer.<br /><br />Every morning Jack goes out on patrol, fixes downed drones, and they complain to \\"management\\" up in \\"Tat\\", a large module miles wide, that is shuttling the last of humanity to its new colony on Saturn's moon, Titan.<br /><br />And every morning the communication from Tat asks , \\"Are you an effective team?\\" and all hell will break loose if it's other than \\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />Who could ask for more?<br /><br />There's more to the story than that. We are introduced to an apparency. And like Matrix, there is more than meets the eye and all is revealed, in bits and pieces, as the alien resistance, led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech, is also not all it seems.<br /><br />Plots and Points:<br /><br />I won't reveal much, just to say the story will be familiar to many sci-fi fans. The action is non-stop (but it's not a military film), and the story slowly unfolds (but it's not Matrix). The plausible machinery (the dragonfly-like helicopter-ship with space travel capability) and Jack's cool, futuristic motorcycle are fun to watch and experience.<br /><br />The film's expostulation of what our world will be like is shocking - New York is completely wiped out. We have the library, subway system and the Brooklyn Bridge at hand. What sci-fi movie does NOT have the Statute of Liberty's arm up in the air, a common feature in these types of films since the Planet of the Apes!<br /><br />Best scenes: Getting your cycle stolen from aliens. I mean, that's really a shame! The humor as Jack catches that ball at the stadium, site of the 2017 World Series. And the hideaway that Jack keeps, a mountain lake and cabin, with remnants of humanity's technology (great Jazz vinyl) unknown to his partner Victoria.<br /><br />When a signal brings down Odyssey, a ship that's been in orbit \\"pre-War\\", and one survivor, a woman who had been in his flashback dreams, completely destroys all the harmony and substance of Jack's world and sends him on a frantic hunt to find the truth or meet elimination at the guns of drones!<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you like your sci-fi with great scenes, seamless CGI and a constant plot with no pausing, then see this film. The film does take some concentration and if you're observant, you can follow along just fine. In fact I may get the DVD to fill in any points I missed.<br /><br />IMAX, was worth it!<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Directed by<br />Joseph Kosinski<br /><br />Writing credits<br />Joseph Kosinski (screenplay) and<br />Karl Gajdusek (screenplay) and<br />Michael Arndt (screenplay)<br /><br />Cast<br /><br />Tom Cruise ...

B005WUHAX8|2.0|great for protection. horrible if you actually want to be able to hear the other person speaking while you're on the phone.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Works great on Kindle, but not on phone (forceclosure at least every minute).  Still recommend it.  The larger screen also makes it more user friendly.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|Every 5 minutes it buffered. Movie is terrific, but if you try to watches anywhere but in a computer it will be delayed. On Xbox every few minutes it would buffer.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Very exciting and a real nail biter. I recommend it to all my friends who are Jack Reacher fans. Tom Cruise does not fit in to my imagination as a Jack Reacher; he is too short.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great book.kept me under wraps and sucked me in for the finish. I highly recommend.a fast read and captivating.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|A riveting read indeed! Mrs. Sebold has crafted a wonderfully, and paradoxically moribund story. Throughout the novel, the magnificent scenes of sudden revelation, udder destruction of humanity in an individual, or the oxymoronic subtle sledgehammer scenes that rip your heart away. While not quite a masterpiece, The Lovely Bones is a fantastic read that will destroy, renew, and stay with you throughout its length and certainly beyond.<br /><br />The faults are few, but addressable. The most major bring the timeline and story structure. The main story shifts randomly into flashbacks annoyingly often, and even though these moments often offer insight and understanding, they more often merely get in the way. Secondly, the author seemed to give up a bit toward the end. While the end contains much pivotal story, it is far less powerful than the beginning of th  novel. And finally, the twist towards the end that sends the books towards conclusion was entirely random and unbelievable. While I keep an open mind when regarding  premises as this one, the author has certain boundaries of sanity to remain in, and the twist was absolutely uncalled for and took away an immensity from the rest of the tome.<br /><br />In conclusion, the four stars given are hard and almost perfectly measured. In truthfulness, the book deserves closer to a 4.5 if anything.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like it just fine. Except for the intrusion to log on to Facebook at the end of every set just to accumulate more lives it could be more interesting for me.

B003YL4KS0|4.0|Technical Difficulties!<br />I purchased this last week for my Kindle App that I use via my iPad 1. There was no sound to any of the videos. The videos would play but no sound. I recalled someone's review stating that the sound could only be heard on the iPad or iPhone. I thought using the Kindle App on my iPad would be fine, but it is not. I had to order the book from Apple iBooks. All videos played great and had sound. If you don't want to hear the audio on the videos the book worked just fine with the Kindle app.<br /><br />Now the book...<br />I really like this book. I am only 7 weeks post my last relaxer. I am African American. I have been trying to read everything I can about going natural. This book has been well worth my time. I have read many blogs and watched many You Tube videos that have been helpful.  I really wanted a book and this has been the answer for my beginning transition steps. I have read about 2/3 of the book. There are chapters devoted to hair textures that are commonly African American. The author does a great job explaining things. I would recommend this to anyone interested in having healthy curly hair.<br /><br />However, I would say that the book has A LOT of fluff. I would rather just get to the point. That is why I rated it 4 and not 5.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I had no idea what to expect, but reviews at the time of this movie's release piqued my interest. It truly is an excellent movie. Instead of a depressing story of a polio survivor trapped for all but four hours a day in an iron lung, it was the story of a man determined to live life as fully as his condition would allow, with a lot of humor interspersed throughout the story. Anyone looking for pornographic entertainment is going to be very disappointed, because the nudity and the sexual scenes in the movie were very tastefully done, and all of the actors were outstanding in their roles.
B0096PYUE2|4.0|While this App is valuable, it's often unappreciated because it works in the 'background' and often isn't noticed until a web page asks for it and it's not there.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is such a rich movie similar to Lord of the Rings only the monsters are human.  Completely addicting. It will keep you up at night. Not because of lingering indelibilities in your head, but because you can't stop playing the next episode.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Works great!  Opens files I need it to open and serves the purpose for which I bought it for and I love it.

B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|This film has much of the feel of the others, but with a more kid-oriented feel.  Some of the stuff gets over-the-top for adults, but the children found it hilarious.

B00992CF6W|1.0|I wanted to try out this game but without buying first you can't do anything. The pc demo lags and freezes also the java cirt is unknown for their main site. The phone demo works but has no save I lost all my progress hours of work 2 times because this cheep \\"donkey\\" company won't allow people to save on the demo. Well their loss I would probally have bought it if I could have continued off of the work I did in the demo but to start over it would have to be 1/4 the price or less. I just wish I could give it negative stars. no save in demo no money for their cheap \\"donkeys\\" ;]
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|No chemistry with the couple. The visual aspects of the movie made up for the lack of chemistry. The end.
B0050PYNOY|2.0|Warning! I will bet you won't like this one. The world could have gotten by witout it. It's crude, but not all that funny the way Monty Python or SNL can be ! It might get by as a rental but Amazon has many better offers. I'm hard pressed to even tell the plot. Some others here will tell you....and probably warn you.
B0095P31L6|4.0|This movie is great for all ages it has it's moments of suspense.  It is also action packed and most of all cheap.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Fantastic movie. Absolutely love it. Such a great deal buying this movie on amazon vs buying in the store. Pre-ordered this movie and it didn't arrive as soon as I'd hoped, but I knew when it was coming because of the tracking feature.

B008J05EL8|1.0|I can't believe that I was stupid enough to actually pay for something that should be part of the Kindle package.  And there were no interesting fonts either.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like that my notes sync across all my devices. I use it for recipes, to do lists, DIY tutorials, and more.
B000I14UTS|5.0|Almost certainly the best directed movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies.  Everything ties together, the songs interpreting the action, sometimes offensive, always brilliant.  Joel Grey is exquisite as the creepiest of all creepy MCs, Liza Minelli IS Sally. No one else will ever be able to play that part.  This is only one of two movies I can find nothing critical to say about.  Plot, acting, music, direction all perfect.  A triumph.  BTW, the Hitler youth grew up to be an architect.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It killed my kindle and froze everything<br />and when I called the comp. and they wouldn't send me a new kindle
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book was not as vivid as the first 2 of the series. It still was not bad just a little more quiet. I am amazed that the author has as much knowledge as she has on the subject. It was not as informative as the first either. I enjoyed reading the series and hope the author has more to write about.
B000AGTPUU|2.0|As a child I grew up reading Chris Van Allsburg's book [[ASIN:0395389496 The Polar Express]], about a young boy who climbs aboard a mysterious train late one Christmas Eve and takes a trip to the North Pole, where one lucky child will be selected to receive the first gift of Christmas.  The illustrations held a dreamy, mystical feel to them, and the story was simple and spare but still struck a chord with millions of children and adults around the world, including myself.  And to this day I consider it a holiday classic, right up there with \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" and \\"Gift of the Magi.\\"<br /><br />When the movie version of said book was announced, I was skeptical to say the least.  Movies based on books often pale in comparison to their source material, in my opinion, and movies based on children's books have an even higher chance of failing, given that they often have to stretch and pad the source material to make anything approaching a feature-length film.  I decided to give the film a chance, however, not wanting to dismiss it simply for being an adaptation of a beloved tale.<br /><br />Sadly, the film indeed fell flat on multiple fronts.  Even ignoring the fact that it's an adaptation, it's still a fairly bad movie -- maybe not \\"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\\" bad, but still not the classic I love.<br /><br />\\"The Polar Express\\" follows a young boy (never named, just like in the source material) who is skeptical about Santa's existence, but nonetheless still climbs aboard the titular train when it stops at his house on Christmas Eve.  He interacts with the other children aboard said train -- most notably a girl who flip-flops between being bold and timid as the plot requires, a timid boy from a poor family who has his own doubts about Christmas, and an annoying know-it-all nerdy boy -- as well as with the over-the-top conductor and a grouchy train-hopping hobo who may or may not be real.  Various mishaps, some instigated by the boy himself, threaten to keep the Polar Express from reaching the North Pole in time for Santa's departure, however... and the boy's skepticism may prove to be the biggest obstacle of all.<br /><br />For me, this movie fails to captivate me for several reasons.  The biggest reason is the visuals -- while they're technically impressive and there are some beautiful scenery shots, the entire movie just looks lifeless.  This is most evident in the human characters, who were filmed with motion-capture technology in an attempt to look more realistic but end up looking like animated mannequins or even corpses.  Human characters in Pixar films and in later DreamWorks films still manage to look lively and exhibit personality despite being pixels on screens, but the characters in \\"Polar Express\\" fall straight into the Uncanny Valley -- they look ALMOST real, but not quite, and it's that \\"not quite\\" quality that ends up making them creepy.  The rest of the film doesn't look much better, though -- the North Pole is one of the most boring and grim-looking versions of Santa's headquarters that I've ever seen, the elves look like they belong in a Lord of the Rings film instead of a holiday children's flick, and Santa... well, the animators made the weird choice of giving him a glowing aura, which makes him look more radioactive than enchanting.<br /><br />The writing isn't much better.  Again, weird choices were made here -- instead of fleshing the story out by giving the characters actual backstories, it decides to pad its length with frantic action sequences, weird detours, and pointless side plots.  The main character never even gets a name, and the decision to make him a skeptic (when the original book clearly made him a believer in Santa) strikes me as odd.  None of the other characters are very likable -- they're bland at best (the girl, the poor boy, Santa himself) and downright annoying at worst (the nerdy kid, the conductor, the hobo).  The dialogue is awkward as well, with no one's lines sounding at all natural and the voice actors mostly sounding like they're reading straight from the script.  Tom Hanks voices no fewer than four characters in this film (the conductor, the hobo, the boy's dad, and Santa himself), but despite the fact that he's usually a wonderful actor and has done great voiceover work before (the \\"Toy Story\\" films), here he simply chews scenery and delivers his lines in as over-the-top fashion as possible.<br /><br />Overall, this film just feels forced -- like they were deliberately trying to make a holiday classic and filled in all the blanks of the \\"formula.\\"  They threw together all the prerequisite elements, but put no effort into actually making said elements work.  The songs are forgettable and have some rather cringe-worthy lyrics, the dance numbers are forced, and lines and speeches geared toward evoking Christmas spirit and charm just fall flat.  I think the filmmakers failed to realize that you can't just slap together \\"required\\" elements and have an instant classic -- only time, and putting true heart and effort into a film, will make it a classic.<br /><br />I do hear this film is better if seen in 3D, and I can see where that comes from -- there are plenty of obvious \\"3D\\" shots in this film, and I can see where said parts would be better viewed in that fashion.  But 3D feels like an unnecessary gimmick to me, and a film should work on its own merits, not just because of the 3D.  (That and some of the 3D parts, such as the runaway train sequences, make me wonder if the film wasn't designed with a roller coaster in mind, as if the filmmakers were hoping Universal Studios would take notice...)<br /><br />I highly recommend the original book in place of this movie -- even though it's a mere ten-minute read, it's well worth your time.  And if you want an enjoyable Christmas film, I'd suggest \\"A Christmas Story,\\" \\"The Santa Clause\\" (first movie only), the 2D animated \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" special, \\"Home Alone,\\" or even \\"A Muppet Christmas Carol\\" in place of this.g at all natural and the voice actors mostly sounding like they're reading straight from the script.

B004ZMWUCU|1.0|Only the title was enjoyable. The characters are flat and far more stereotypical than I thought they would be. Ireland is a wonderful place but the plot washed away the thrill of its reality.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Myself and two of my friends watched this together, 2 girls and a guy.  We were amused but could've skipped it.  He said he liked it much better when he watched it with his guy friends.  Not terrible, but I was hoping for more coming from MacFarlane.
B009R659L8|4.0|I am a fan of MHC, I always buy her books.<br />The good: This story kept me guessing and trying to keep the various characters straight. The twists and turns kept me wanting to read more!<br />The bad: I purchased this for my Kindle Fire and found that the print changed in the middle of the page and when I turned the page entire sentences were missing. I had to return to the previous page and change the font size to access the missing sentences. This happened throughout the book. I have noticed other Kindle users had the same trouble. This is the reason I did not give the book 5 stars. I never realized how important formatting is until I read this book. Hope this can be easily fixed for other Kindle readers.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great film, catchy songs.  It is not life changing or an epic classic- but does every movie need to be?
B001NLL93W|5.0|I'm hooked and can't wait to see what's going to happen to the Shadowhunters next!  This series keeps me wanting more...
B000002IO1|5.0|A great voice and a great album.  With ZZtop  like riffs, a sexy \\"whiskey\\" voice, and a great bass line, this album was worth it to me if only for Black Velvet,  but the album as a whole does well in showcasing Miss Myles voice and singing skills.  The variety of songs and singing styles does her and the genre credit.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I saw the movie subsequent to reading the book; both were excellent sources of entertainment.  However, I found the book to be more intellectually absorbing while the graphics within the movie were, for me, striking
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Sad heartbreaking story of poverty, hunger, desperation for a family living in Ireland in the 1930s and 40s and how one child made it to America to fulfil his dreams.
0385349947|4.0|Gave it as a gift to professional daughter she has not finished reading it yet, but I am next in line
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Where to start, if you are this far into the series you are already hook.  You most likely love the story, and want to keep diving in.  Well buckle down and start reading, the only problem with this book is it ends.  Sure sometimes the story seems to drag sometimes like it does in some of his other books to, but what you find is as you keep reading, those &#34;boring&#34; parts actually had story lines and details that are quite rewarding down later on.  I even picked up on some foreshadowing of what I think is coming in the next books.  That's one of my favorite things George does.  Sure it can be a 2 edged sword, his detailed writing and multiple characters, means not as much of the story passes by, but lets be honest.  We are all just impatient and want to know what happens to our characters at this point.  So any of the reviews that are negative are mostly just people who can't wait for the next two books.  Just ignore them and keep reading, you are already so invested at this point, trust me you won't be disappointed in this book, except when you finish it, cause you will still be wanting more.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Cinematography is amazing !!  &#34;Welcome to Pi's arc&#34; very clever, animals are incredible, great acting. We watched it twice. Fab !

0525953728|4.0|From a person who has never served in the military, this book was an easy read. It gives a lot of pertinent background, besides the details of the mission.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Although I admit I do like this book more than the first one, I'm also completely annoyed for so many reasons.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|For anyone who is a fan of the typical MOBA such as League of Legends or DOTA be aware that this is (in theory) going to replicate that experience, however the screen will be smaller, the controls more difficult to use and because Gameloft is really only a cash cow with no intention of creating a decent game, there are millions of in-app purchases and options to &quot;share&quot; your acheivements on facebook. Not only is the interface poor, the gameplay is shoddy. The leveling system allows players to scale way ahead of their opponents simply by taking a slight lead, and then allows them to keep that lead by sitting in the opponents base and repeatedly killing them without consequence. There are constant leavers in PVP which greatly ruins gameplay, and earning in-game money to purchase new heroes takes a very long time. If you want a decent MOBA, look into League of Legends. But Heroes of Order and Chaos has Provence to be unsatisfactory.
0783240287|5.0|Love this movie--Donny Osmond at his best, with his little wicked smile, arrogant Joseph attitude, superiority complex telling his brothers his dreams.  Of course, he pays for this bit of boasting by being sold as a slave.  This is great for children as well as adults, and teaches us a tale as old as time of love, hate, jealousy, revenge, forgiveness, faith and belief.  The songs are captivating--I have watched this at least 50 times and it is still one of my favorites!  Do yourself a big favor and watch this--it is a thing of beauty.  We can all see a bit of ourselves in this biblical tale.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Unique story that keeps getting better chapter by chapter.  This author won me over!  After reading the first chapter, I had to purchase all the remaining chapters.  I recommended this to friends and co-workers who all loved it.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|Most times a movie is made from a book I hate when they deviate but with this one I loved it. The cast was awesome and it really brought out the obsessiveness/quirkiness of some birders. Anyone planning on having a relationship with a birder should watch this prior to getting serious.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It was a very interesting novel.  A little too &#34;technical&#34; for the average lay person but it was enjoyable.  I did root for the hero to return safely but in some ways, I found him a little bit too much of a &#34;Mary Sue&#34; character at times.  Worth a read for this price.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was hysterically funny and smart and witty.  I was never a huge Tina Fey fan but let me tell you I am now.  I never realized just how far she has made it and how intelligent she really is.  I am now starting 30 rock from the beginning and I love it
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great sci-fi story with a fantastic premises! This has to be one of my favorite sci-fi novels of all time.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book really speaks to where are youth are today and why we need to focus on bullying.  Our children are failing in compassion for others and this book was a real eye opener
B004RPINV2|5.0|This story is captivating emotional and leaves you wanting more. I couldn't put it down and when I had finished it I read it again.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Watched it, loved it, and then loaned it to my daughter.  Can't wait to get it back to watch it again.  It's one of those movies (like Tom Petty's Running Down a Dream) I'll listen to over and over again while I'm sewing because it's so interesting.  So much history, can't get it all in just one viewing.
B003UESJGA|5.0|Wonderful little movie.  Blu ray quality very good.  Love how they took a serious subject and incorporated humor.  Love english movies!

1439152799|3.0|At last, I finished reading Kate Morton's third book, The Distant Hours! I have been reading this book on and off for quite some time. I've read The Forgotten Garden (her second book) and absolutely loved it and then I read The House at Riverton, which I might not have liked as much as the former, but it was just as enjoyable. That made me really excited about her third book, which I expected to be even better than the second book, but it wasn't...<br /><br />To be completely honest, the book did not hook me. The copy I had was 680 pages, and I found the first 150 pages interesting, but from there onwards until about page 480 I felt that the book dragged.<br />The book was not bad, it just wasn't as interesting as her former two.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I found this to be a learning experience.  This book is informative and enlightening.<br />I don't necessarily agree 100% with all of his conclusion.  Intelligent people should be able to discern for them selves what is and is not helpful for self. Many people have trouble with this author.  They will throw out everything because they don't agree with one thing.<br />Read, discern for yourself what is helpful for you to you. I found it to be a growing experience, growth in spirit, in coming to terms and acceptance of childhood memories.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|After watching the movie, I fell in love with the music.  It's a beautiful story.  Despite what everyone says, I love Russell Crowe as Javert.  I thought his voice was great, and I fell in love with Eponine and Gavroche.  Love this movie!
141659521X|5.0|Always an interesting and exciting read; hard to put down.  Vince Flynn is my favorite author; I trust he will beat the cancer.
B0063IH60K|2.0|To many ads popping up.  Very annoying. Did not realize when I bought the app that everytime I play a new game, ads pop up.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is an outstanding novel. I would strongly recommend this book. I couldn't put it down. I saw the movie also. Both kept me engrossed in the plot.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Bought this as a birthday present for my grandmother. She LOVES it. She watches it all the time! Everyone in the family really enjoyed, including my 8 month old son
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Reading the series of 5 books. Currently on #4. They are a great read and I would recommend them to anyone who likes these mystical settings.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This movie is very well done. I never knew it was a broadway play before a movie but I would love to see it one day. There's was a lot of good elements. The intro. was a great attention getter. Started off with 60's music and telling a life story. It fitted in a really good era when everything change for worst or better. Then there was, my favorite, the local mob they were awesome plus chazz was good as always. The main character had to make choices but he had a lot of support from the head guy and his father. Well, I can go for days but hopefully get the picture :).
B009IUH1N2|4.0|This is a fun little game for times when you just have a few minutes you need to pass.  The game-play is simple and the graphics work well with the overall tone.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Usually with two genre like these would work but they hardly put them together. The suspense part as more of the question; What happen to the kids and where did they go? Horror part was buguul's element and development. both of the genres mix work out brilliantly.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game has a lot of twists and turns. It was a bit harder than other games I've played. The only problem I have is that you have to go to the paid version way early in the game.  Other than that it ia a great hidden object game as are all the G5 games are.
B00A2H9L2E|4.0|This portray closer to the video game and had a little bit of first movie too. In my opinion it was a good movie and more better than the first.
B008VBYN80|2.0|not a bad app but if you want to really get anywhere on it you need to spend real money and I just cant see doing that for a game....
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This could be a fun game, but I had a hard time getting the game to respond.  I believe this could be more of an issue with my Kindle Fire and the touch screen.  I had to tap numerous times on the screen to get a response and cleaning my screen did not help.  What little I did play, I did enjoy, but got frustrated with how it worked on my Kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found it to be real, but beautiful. Green does a great job mixing the humor and the raw truth about life's (and death's) tough parts.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If your a fan of Quentin Tarantino films you will not be disappointed. Top Stars Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Don Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson all did an excellent job!!! Non stop action throughout!!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I'm an avid reader, of various genres and I don't think I've read anything as pathetic as this book.  The writing is average, which I can often look beyond if the story is great, however this had nothing going for it.  The characters were pathetic and desperate, and the storyline was boring, predictible and absolute nonsense.  I gave it a fair go and read right to the end of book one, however won't be continuing on with book two.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I just bought this for my wife, after using it for my own mouse I totally fell in love with it and now she does too.<br /><br />UPDATE: As I said before i previously bought this product for my self, well after about a year of use it no longer charges. Which totally sucks, the charging pad sill lights up and the mous works perfectly with other batteries. But when I try to charge the battery pack it just will no longer charge.

B006BXTOFC|5.0|The more I listen, the more I like it.  Every song on the album has it's place and lures me in to sing along.  Sure, I may look like a weirdo to that person in the car next to me at a stop light, but they're they weirdo to me since they aren't enjoying their music as much.  Great effort put forth by the band.

Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a good album, but if you're looking for the punch the first one had, I don't think you'll find it here.  To me, it felt like the first album had more emotion to the songs and they way he sung about them.  This album almost feels like it's filler music.  However, it's really good filler music.  ;-]
B006J3Y20Q|5.0|This book has ALWAYS been one of my favorites.<br />The ideas behind the plot were so drastically different from every day life, that it makes you not want to stop reading. Jonah's trails of learning all the Giver's secrets keeps you enthralled. By Far the best story of my generation!
B00BF123WG|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and I don't feel 4 stars gives it justice, but I don't feel it REALLY deserves 5 stars.  The story is amazing, the acting from most was spot on, but I missed having a connection with the main character (girl).  I don't feel there was enough of her background of who she is, why she chose the job she's in, and why she was so adamant about her search for the courier.  To be honest, I never really felt that much of a connection to any of the characters.  Don't let that stop you from watching this great movie, it's well worth a rental.
0743201140|4.0|Loved the book and it taught me a lot ... the test was eye opening!
B005PYZG6E|1.0|Based on the price, I had fairly low expectations. I just wanted something that would offer a reasonably smooth moving shot -- one step above just holding the camera and walking. Even when perfectly balanced (the bubble level was useful), the unit either rocked back and forth, or turned too much. I can do almost as well -- if not equally well -- without this product.<br /><br />The results of several tests were disappointing, so I called Opteka tech support and talked to Mike. His \\"help\\" was even more disappointing than the product. I asked if he could tell me some basic tips for using the Opteka SteadyVid EX. He said he could not. Really? There's no owners manual, and the company itself can't offer a few basic pointers? So I asked if there was anyone there who could provide some additional insight. He said there was not.<br /><br />In case I just got one of Opteka's less experienced tech support guys, I thanked Mike and hung up. I then called a different department, customer service. Mike answered again. I'm starting to get a picture of this company. The SteadyVid is going back, and I'll buy from a different company.
0486275590|5.0|Some books are classics for a reason.  They encompass all the reasons we love reading.  They transport us to special places and times, outside of our personal scope, and help us leave our lives behind for a few hours to indulge in something else, something different.  `Treasure Island' is just that type of novel.  It allows the reader to experience something truly remarkable, something far removed from their average lives.<br /><br />It allows us to experience pure, unbridled adventure.<br /><br />Most are familiar with this story, for it is one that has been immortalized in literature and in film (there is even a Muppets version that was a blessed moment of my youth) and so I won't get into all the particulars.  I'll merely state that I just finished reading this for the first time since my early childhood (I read it in my pre-teens by haven't revisited it since) and it is just as spellbinding now as it was then.  Regardless of age, this is a tensely woven story that will entrance from start to finish.  The creation of Long John Silver is one that is unmatched even today, a ruthless villain who is remembered even today.<br /><br />Yes, the language can be hard to shuffle through, and so this isn't the novel to read to a five year old (believe me, I tried) but despite the complex wording and old English narrative, this is a brilliant prose and is constructed beautifully.<br /><br />Treasure, swashbuckling excitement, mutiny, loyalty and much, much more; `Treasure Island' is an unforgettable adventure for all ages.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was a very interesting and entertaining story. Unlike other Stephen King books I've read but definitely worth the time. He really knows how to tell a story
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Each character is beautifully written and artfully developed to draw you into their hearts. You understand why they do what they do and why those around them react the way they do. Rare insight into the emotional struggles of an individual whose life path has changed irrevocably.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very well written, good plot, unexpected twists and turns. Great story line! I had no idea what this book was about and just started reading it. It went above and beyond my expectations!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very few reads achieve what this does - it is hugely entertaining with surprising life lessons imbedded into the humour. A feel good book which I can't stop talking about and am sure to read again.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Great album from a great bunch of local guys. Jesse sounds even better than before. Can't wait till they come home for a killer show
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great solitaire game for kids and adults.  I have att U-Verse and they are taking off their free games.  I  guess ATT isn't making quite enough with most monthly bills running $200.  (that includes internet and HD TV and phone)  What a bargain.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a hidden object game with a good story, it has plenty of different scenes to play with the odd puzzle thrown in for good measure. It isn't too taxing but does have a hint button if you do get stuck which offers sensible clues. My one criticism is possibly that it was too short! Makers should consider a follow up.
B008L1F91A|4.0|this is a great looking statue based on the iconic Jim Lee's art.  Great art plus great character equals a nice collector item.  My only complaint is that the back is a little too curved on this and all the figures.  I actually like it better in the box than by itself for this reason.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a 15 year old girl and after finishing it this is now one of my favorite books. It is the perfect amount of romantic and tragically sad.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My 6 yr old saved an entire yr to buy this, and in his words worth every penny. The un boxing itself is special. He was floored at the number of boxes (4) and the ringed 270 page manual. From step 1 onwards it was a great father/son experience.  Broken down in stages, and amazingly al 3,800+ pieces were there, plus about 50 extras.<br />Technically very difficult and while it was easy for me, my 6 yr old did struggle in parts, but overall was able to do about 60% of the set by himself. I would find the pieces and he would assemble. Fantastic durability once built, and play value is best I have seen in his considerably large collection. A must have set and worth every penny. Much better value vs most sets. My son loves it!  Took about 14 hrs of build time.  TIP: once opened all bags for a stage, separate all pieces by color.  It will dominate your dining room table until completed, so be prepared!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Action packed, with classic suits and sultry dresses, that Bond character, the indomitable Ms M and interesting locations make for another fun installment of the Bond movies. And the theme music is always just right in my ears. This one did not let me down. Another 50 years please.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I love Quentin Tarantino movies and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one!! It was action packed and kept my attention
B00B2V66VS|5.0|we all love playing this game. its a lot of fun except from time to time when it quits. working.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Great movie! It was a great production and seemed to be accurate of how things really were at the time. Historical accuracy was bar none ehwn it comes to a box office hit.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Excellent representation of the power of grace and redemption in the life of one many, may consider to be the &#34;least of these.&#34;  We'll done; uplifting, challenging, heartbreaking, and thrilling!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi was one of the most original books I have read in a long time.  The characters, including the animals, were memorable.  the book touched on the essentials of life: God, fate, survival.  And what we want to believe.  It was told from more than one point of view.  Life of Pi is destined to be a classic.  And I learned a lot about animals and their nature.  I like a book best that teaches me something.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|It was enlightening when Ms Sandberg highlighted that whe a man takes a certain position it is considered acceptable because it is expected but if a women takes the same position she is considered unlikeable because it is not considered acceptable for women to be tough.
B005CRQ2XA|1.0|It it really a good idea to go to all the books because it is a good good book .you should really check it out I'm just telling you that's all I can tell you that the boys are really funny and stupid
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|1this was a very unique gift to get my wife, she had no idea they still made vinyl. Hope to get more records to add to the collection
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This brain surgeon documents the fact that he was considered temporarily brain dead so that his near death experience could not have been simply his injured brain playing tricks on him. I would like to see his experience become the basis of a paper in a scientific journal validated by other scientists or doctors who would at least testify in the paper that he was really brain dead. If I knew such validation existed, I would be more comfortable with his use of this book to solicit funds for his research projects under the auspices of his foundation: Eternea. I believe some of these experiences are real because I know science is absolutely limited by its own laws, such as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and self-professed limitation to that which can be observed by human senses or instruments. We denigrate our personal experience as subjective when, in truth, &#34;I think therefore I am&#34; is the only thing we are sure of!
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Huge David Bowie fan.<br />I have been giving it an ocassional listening.  Its going very well.  Lets see how this one ages, but im starting to feel that we are in front of a huge one,  maybe even one of his top three records.<br />Right now is not easy since all the noise of the \\"most awaited album of xx year\\" and all now Bowie fan posers.<br />Where are we now is such a deep song,  incredibly awesome.<br />Valentine´s day shows once more Bowie´s geniality and well structured melodies he can create.  There are easily four gems on this album, and I have not past really of the seventh or eight track really.<br />CHEW SLOW and ENJOY !
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Epic Adventures: Cursed Onboard, is a game that holds your attention. It has great seek and find segments. throughout the game, and the faint ghost whispers lend to the heighten sense of fear and urgency to complete the missions.
B006MPKD54|5.0|Harry Bosch is a flawed character that makes this that much more appealing. He does what many of us would do and does it without over thinking it or being plagued by guilt. He is the sort of cop we would feel safe around, so long as you aren't the bad guy. Loved it!
B008ADUHKW|4.0|This is certainly one of the better books out of Canadian literature. Easy to see why Alice Munro is considered one of the best of our times.<br />Characters are well etched. All seem to have an understanding of their own failings and that of others. But no one is overly philosophical about it. They seem to have the attitude..life moves on. The attitude that we all have to adopt in the end, if we want to remain sane. These are indeed stories about, simply, life...
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Recommend this game highly! !!!  Sooooo Much Fun!!  Wonderful. My hubby got it on his kindle HD &amp; loves it also!!!
1451683405|2.0|Whether free will exists or not can not be determined by reading this pamphlet. everything I have read by Harris reduces my regard for his intellect.
B00AEFY5B6|3.0|I'm not disappointed in the movie per say, haven seen it in a different format and copied it from TV. I love the story, although it is really just a revenge story, but the side characters, the culture and the action make it seem richer. But the TV version was much better in many places. They had a nice flow in the battle scene, for example, but this version is longer (which is nice) but doesn't flow nicely. The music and pace of the action was great on TV. Sometimes a director falls in love with his own directing and tries to do too much. Perhaps Ridley Scott's direction caused it to lose its flow. The guy was good at large scale scenes such as this and did a great job on the gladiator fight scenes, the editing especially and the epic sized sets, but his artistic direction was a bit forced. Also, I don't recommend the scenes between brother Emperor Commodus and his sister for the sensitive set or younger people. Another negative is the historic aspect. They use some real names but this is not an historic story at all. But just ignore that if you know better and enjoy the flick. Just get a different version if you can.
0767817478|5.0|For all Godzilla fans this is a must for the collection.  We enjoyed the extra features and look forward to more Godzilla.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|This is a fairly light hearted movie, full of silliness and slapstick humor. Yet, there are some good messages, even though not realistic. I enjoy Stephen Chow's humor and he has his usual cronies to help. Wei Zhou is good also. Somehow they made her look ugly and beautiful at the same time. The only thing to watch for is the repeated abuse heaped on some characters might give younger people the wrong idea or want to go out and hit somebody with a wrench just to see what happens. As I said, totally unbelievable, but typical Stephen Chow slapstick to the max.
B000H30B2C|5.0|The deluxe set is fantastic.  Totally worth the purchase and a must for Kong fans.  This set offers so much for the family and I would recommend it for anyone.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I'm not much of a fan of the story in this one, but my kids love it. The music is catchy and the characters are distinctive and interesting as usual for Disney's older movies. This movie was one of the early ones for combining 2d and 3d techniques and the landscapes and colors are stunning. The plot is the typical one told animal style. But all told this movie will go down as one for the history books as an example of early animated movies.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing! This book is just like fifty shades of grey. It is a very good book and I love how in depth you go with the details.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next two!<br />Suzanne Collins, it is the best book I've ever read!
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|What a wonderful collection! These books are usually to be found in the children's section of any library or bookstore but there's nothing childish about the themes. Family, friendship, love, birth, death, marriage - it's all there. Stories of people who seem so real you cheer for them every time, no matter how many times you're read their stories before. Definitely a keeper.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Zeptolabs never fails to deliver. Time and time again they come out with games that keep me busy for months and I enjoy every second. I had no hesitation in buying this game and do not regret it at all. It is wonderfully fun.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Romantic and entertaining.  I laugh out loud every time I watch it.  It is very funny!  One of my favorite movies.
B000FC13MM|5.0|A long time ago, my high-school librarian introduced me to this book, and I've been hooked on Garth Nix ever since. The writing is clear and intense, and the plot and pacing never let up. The world and its magic is deep and interesting, and well thought-out overall. After I read it, I passed it off to both of my brothers (neither of whom are big readers) and they devoured it. Even my mother, who mostly reads romance novels, read this and its sequels in a matter of a week. You won't be disappointed!
0618918248|5.0|There is not much to say beyond what has been said here, but I will throw in my 2 cents anyway.<br /><br />I read this book some time in 2007, and refer back to it from time to time. While this book has solid arguments against the existence of God, the real strength of this book is exposing the harm that can come from religion. This book makes the case for reason over faith, for thought before action, for secularism to oust religion. I was an atheist before reading this book, though I would not have called myself that prior to reading the book. After reading this book, I proudly wore the label \\"atheist.\\" What this book showed me is the importance of having a secular society, and the richness of the secular movement.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone. If you are a fundamentalist Christian, it is unlikely that you will get anything from this book, unless you just want to read what the \\"other side\\" thinks. It is essentially a sharp rebuke of your position. Rather, this book is for those who are already questioning their faith or those who are already an atheist. For those questioning their faith, this book will expose the irrationality of religion and the potential harm religion can do. For those who are already atheists, this book will explain the importance of having a secular society and will show you why you should be proud that you have escaped the chains of religion.
B00136NYR6|5.0|One of the greatest, most important, and most ENJOYABLE albums ever made.  Your music collection is absolutely NOT complete without it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A fast paced legal drama, I couldn't put it down.  And a surprise ending. If courtroom drama is your thing, you'll enjoy this one.
B00AA0U05A|3.0|The song list sold it, and while she gives it a good go, she is basically a good hotel cabaret singer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My eight year old daughter has tried several horse games now including ones we must pay for.  This is her current favorite.
1439153663|4.0|Its Not &#34;The Help&#34; but its a decent read.  Picks up in the last 50 pages.  Probably a good book club choice if you want to get discussion going.  Intersting premise.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I'd been wondering what all the fuss was about, so when a friend recommended Wild on a recent phone chat, I finally downloaded it to my iPhone. Then I made the mistake of starting it when I woke up in the middle of the night, thinking a bit of reading would help me sleep.<br /><br />Wrong! Instead of lulled to sleep, I was booknapped for the next three days, everything else in my life put on hold while I snagged every opportunity to read on.<br /><br />Strayed's raw story and luscious writing ripped my heart out, ground it up, and handed it back to me on a plate. She shares her own journey of transformation with such skill that I almost feel like I hiked the PCT myself (sans the blackened, missing toenails). Through her story, we witness how healing and transformation actually work: painfully, one weighed-down step at a time, amidst danger and risk. And worth every second.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is the best of Disney movies. the great music and stories for the whole family.  I share it with my great nephews.  so  wonderful
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I didn't get what the poles were until they started transporting, and I still didn't quite get it.  I like it because it was explained better than the 2nd movie (Revenge of the Fallen).  Perspective of an 11 year old.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a superb series, one with a great story line, well-developed characters and historic insight into life in England early in the twentieth century among the well-to-do.
B000HZGCEG|3.0|It's a good plot but easy to miss the &#34;Why did they do that?&#34;'s.  The plot was fun and interesting, but it may not have been had we not had the book to draw on to understand the flow of events that were never explained.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked this book. It was a good mystery, it I would honestly have to say that I liked Gone Girl better. However, still worth the read.
B001JIDE3M|2.0|We are expected to accept too many unlikely events.  Everything goes impossibly right or impossibly wrong and very unlikely at that.  Even though the characters make really poor judgments, they make it home when they should have been stuck or died in oh-so many ways.  A bit cheesy, too.  But perhaps it’s for the younger viewer (the youngest in our family is 11 years old).
0762434279|3.0|I read abridged version and so I expected a smaller form of the book but not a miniature version.  I was rather surprised when I got the product.  The price quite matches the size i would say even though the shipping was about twice the price.  Nest time you need to let me know that the abridged version is a miniature book.  any way I do believe that when I get them out that those who receive them may appreciate them more than I did initially.  When I get responses to that form of the book I will update my review for the benefit of all
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|It is all about choice. I choose to be happy. The Four Agreements<br />empower me to choose  good guidelines. I CHOOSE.
B004ZP376A|5.0|I hate starting watching tv series because I usually choose the best and as a result become too engrossed. I can say the same with Fringe. Interestingly enough, there was an episode in this season that made me exclaim \\"this is the best television series ever!\\" Unsurprisingly, I believe this is the best Fringe season yet. Why? Because every episode pushes the plot along unlike in past seasons where there were some episodes that are skippable. Overall, fantastic!
0547884591|5.0|Tim really increases the production budget this time around. Being a student at the CIA I wasn't as interested in the recipes as I was the teaching style. One of the most difficult things in a professional kitchen is training new staff... sometimes (depending on the location) from scratch. Tim did a great job concentrating the important info and making it easy to grasp.<br /><br />The survival skills section was awesome, food science, meta-learning techniques like improving memory. Great all around.. Buy it.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|The music and singing in Love Never Dies is amazing! It's also interesting musically because Webber mixed in different styles of music. I've heard some people say Love Never Dies isn't as good as the original Phantom of the Opera, but I think a lot of them are focusing more on the story line.
B000TXNDUW|4.0|The box was slightly bent once taken out of the package, other than that everything is fine. 3 more words
0385512058|3.0|In the eyes of Keith Ferrazzi, success - in our careers and in life - is all about relationships. Everything in our universe is related to everything else through a relationship. We must develop, establish and nurture our relationships in life.  We live in a fast paced life and a connected age, where the day's minutes would be hard pressed to be further packed with communication and staying in touch.<br /><br />Ferrazzi lives and breathes the fast pace of life. Living at the same fast space, he shares here an authentic approach to networking and building life's relationships, one at a time.<br /><br />The essence of Ferrazzi's success is not just networking. It is a 3-fold approach:<br />(1) network to build trust first<br />(2) help people before asking for favors<br />(3) do it all with sincerity<br /><br />Okay that's all great but does that mean we do that at every single meal? Hmmm. Not so practical. Or even scaleable. Or even desirable!<br /><br />Now I did like this a lot: The author's sincere interest in helping others before thinking of his own success, and in fact, that may be the secret to his success. To be truly interested in making yourself useful to others first, even if there is no return for your favors immediately, is his philosophy.<br /><br />Ferrazzi's approach to networking in \\"Never Eat Alone\\" is original and effective but very hard to get on board with in the level of intensity that he preaches.<br /><br />Much of the challenge with networking is the misconceptions - it is exactly everything you want it to be. It is as real or as fake, as fun or as boring, as effective or as big a waste of time as you make it out to be - but do not blame networking and building relationships when you have poor results. It is the approach and intent that needs to be revisited and perhaps that can be the best takeaway, but still, giving it just a very high 3 stars.
B0031R5K8G|3.0|It was quick reading and a nice story, not to deep, and not to shallow.  I would not recommend this to everyone, but if you love easy reading this is for you.
B001F4UHFI|3.0|Could not get it to come up on the TV even after going on line to register it. I had to watch it on the computer
B0031R5K72|4.0|Loved the book, espesially towards the middle.  Bit slow in beginning.  Great to view this time from the death side.

0783233477|4.0|Simple Packaging and great DVD.  Came quickly and was just as expected.  Works just fine in my DVR player as well as PS3.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|Enjoyed this book it was intelligently written with Nesbo's dry humour thrown in to lighten the load.  Keeps the reader on their toes at the end of each chapter.  Will read more as Harry Hole works the plot in a very alternative way.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|Simple Packaging and great DVD.  Came quickly and was just as expected.  Works just fine in my DVR player as well as PS3.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Wow what a great book and a great story.  I have read many of Nicholas Sparks and have never been disappointed and wasn't with is one either.  Now to watch the movie.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Works great. Not very sturdy but what can you expect paying this little.  It works just fine for small balde pocket knives.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved it. There r now gems that u collect and if u die, u can use them 2 come back 2 life. It is totally 1 of the best apps EVER!!!!!!!! : )
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Absolutely love taking pics and editing them, this app is cool, like it a lot. It has a lot of the filters I like and not a lot of fonts but I do enjoy the fonts that they do have.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I'm not reviewing the item because it's not out yet! Why does amazon do this? None of the ratings are for the dvd set but for the show itself. Go to imdb and give a review for the show. Leave the ratings on amazon for the actual item! I had to choose a rating in order to leave this message. I'm not rating the product because I haven't seen it yet.
1881273563|3.0|The tapes have not been used yet, but glad to have ordered them if my fiance will ever listen to them.  It did come with some ware on the outer cover.
006123205X|5.0|Very well done explanation of some of our base behaviors. You will learn some interesting and enlightening differences between Men and Women.
B00913P6G0|3.0|I bought this album because I liked a couple of the songs. (Money Trees, Swimming Pools, B*^&$ Don't kill my vibe, and Poetic Justice) I was hoping that the other songs would be just as good, but they turned out to be a major let down. I should have just left it to the internet to listen to those songs and than I would still have my money.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Just bad.. Be a good movie to fall alsleep on the couch with.<br />Couldn't even make it to the middle of the movie.<br />What does rap music have to do with kung fu movie anyway??<br />Don't waste your money or time on this one.
B002ZG999U|3.0|i bought this movie for the man in my life and he loved it, it had action guns violence and things blowing up.  A total guy movie that he made me watch because i made him watch twilight so i guess it was a fair trade.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like it it is great for sharpening knives and serrated blades.  It is a good size to carry also.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Love the music score and the spiritual lessons learned by the characters. Inspiring- worth watching with a group and or those getting ready for Confirmation.
B006M9NJFG|1.0|the hangers are not big enough for a pistol belt? and they only fit like a 2 inch belt at the absolute most.  they would not be good at all for BOB or survival honestly.  the loops look like they would rip right off if stressed any at all. I would suggest you go with the 2 quart military surplus canteen for 20.00 It is so much of a better quality it is unreal.  teh military one does not come with a cup however you can get a cup for a few dollars more if you need one?
B0091REZMW|4.0|I can play this for hours. love this game. just wish I got energy faster but it's. fun and helps pass time when I'm bored.

B000005HO0|5.0|First was Messiah then Dead then Attila then Maniac and then Attila again all equally Mayhem. Dead was and is still the best of Mayhem: Dead, Euronymous, Necrobutcher & Hellhammer.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This is an awesome concert! The music is great. It is fun to listen to and watch. The picture quality of the concert is really good.
B000000OMB|5.0|This 80's supergroup still sounds as good now as it did then. This is a must-have for our generations musical collector.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|On the plus side, it is great not to have to fuss with the battery door anymore. I am a fan of the magic mouse, and have always felt that the battery door is the single flaw, to hard to remove. The battery does indeed work and doesn't impede normal use.<br /><br />On the minus side, you never really know the current charge level (percentage remaining) at it doesn't report correctly if you check the Apple bluetooth status. Mine always reports 38%, this might not bother most people, who would simply  use the mouse till it dies and then recharge it, or leave it on the charger all the time. If you tend towards the AR geeky side of things, it might bother you a bit, but perhaps forewarned...
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I guess the bar is pretty low because I can't imagine why this got any Oscar nominations.  But then again, I can't imagine why Argo won best picture.  Both were fairly lame.  I guess the story just wasn't there. I'm really glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theatre.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love this because when the alarm first starts it's at a low volume and then gets louder the longer it goes.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a die hard fan. Still can't figure out why they pulled this after only one season. I was hooked from the start.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft is really fun to play on because it is very cool. Did you know on the Xbox on mine craft you can do four players at once.<br />.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Just watched it with Amazon Instant video to test the quality and streaming capabilities.  The movie is good i have seen it before.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Reading books always drags me into living another person's life. Pandemonium is the perfect sequel to Delirium. It left me  screaming at the end for more! No one should be able to read this and not continue on to read Requiem. This book was fantastic, and I am so jealous of the way Lauren Oliver can tie everything together. This is definitely one of my favorite books ever! It is really suspenseful, especially after Alex is taken away in Delirium. The question that readers wait to be answered is answered only in the last chapter:is alex possibly still alive?
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|great graphics cool play.  a must download. for kindle. works great. fun fun fun all the way.  try and make top 1 percent like me ha ha ... so addicting you cant stop playing.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I need a calculator to be quick &amp; easy to use when I need it so I can concentrate on my calculation - not how to use the calculator. This Calculator App fills the bill PERFECTLY.
B003719G40|5.0|I really love the book though I'm single several of my friends encouraged me to read the book. I found it enlightening and beautiful. It helped me understand love with others and my previous partner. I recommend this book to everyone.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I read Baldacci and his fellow genre fiction writers as a somewhat guilty pleasure. I look for a plot that will sweep me up and keep the pages turning & this book certainly provided that. A few non-obvious plot twists will sweeten the game and those were here as well.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is very helpful in the process of making Kindle books, and the price is right too nothing more to say+++
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Jackson blends material that Tolkien came up with later back into the story to make it more of a prequel to the LoTR trilogy.  With the extra material, the length is extended beyond that of the original \\"Hobbit\\" book.  I was expecting the worst, but I was actually pleased with the outcome and look forward to the next.  It is not something that parents should take young kids to expecting the original tale, as it has more gruesome fights and swordplay than LoTRs had.<br /><br />The UltraViolet Flixter is a joke.  I tried to install it 4 times and never succeeded. You download a 423 kb \\"flixtersetup.exe file and then waste your time.  Once you run this for the \\"install,\\" it begins the real download.  At first it said that it had to download 15.6 mb.  As it approached 15.6, it upped to 16.6.  As it approached 16.6, it jumped to 36.6.  As it approached 36.6 it jumped to 47.6.  When it approached 47.6 mb of download, it came up and said that the validity check was bad and it stopped.  It did the exact same thing 4 times.<br /><br />If you want to play it on a portable device, just find DVD43 for any protection, copy the DVD to your hard drive and use Handbrake or a similar program to rip it to a format of your choice.  I should have started with that method so I didn't waste my time trying to setup the poorly coded Flixster.
B005T87QCI|5.0|My 6 year old loves this! It has different levels of difficulty for all ages. Completely worth the money! He can't put the game down!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie is another great example of the talent of Quentin Tarantino, AND the movie is a lot of fun too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finished differently than expected, kept my attention and time passed fast.three was a good number and I was glad it ended where it ended.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I didnt think that this first third of 'The Hobbit' was up to the standard of LOTR when I saw it in the theater (in 2D). They had a lot of 3D staging that didnt seem quite right in 2D. Also 45 minutes, especially that beginning part with Frodo and the old Bilbo could have been lopped off and never missed. But after I had watched this DVD a couple of times my only dissatisfaction was that the distributors are stringing us along for three years instead of letting us see the whole thing all at once so they can squeeze every penny out of their investment that they can. But in early 2016 I will be sitting down with the three 'Hobbit' flicks and the three 'LOTR' movies for the ultimate marathon.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book took my mind into another world. It was detailed  So perfectly it felt like I was actually there.
B008CRC506|5.0|This series about the evolution of a Broadway show is great. The characters are interesting and well-developed and the Byzantine plot twists and turns with lots of surprises and, in true Speilbergian fashion, some satisfying payoffs. Unfortunately, the ratings arent there for the second season so that will be it for &#34;Smash', but I've enjoyed every minute.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I liked it  very much. It is recomendable for a n enjoy reading. I will read it again!!!!  Great writing.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|If you like Tarantino, you'll like this one for sure.  All of his standard fight scenes as his main characters go on a quest / journey.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|For Leonard Cohen fans, this is a must buy, regardless of what albums you might already own.  I had seen a concert the week before and this DVD recaptures the concert .  Not only is the music conveyed but so, too, is the ambience of the concert.<br />Although this recording is from 2008, it is not dated.  It has the feel of a 2013 concert- an older, pensive, somewhat resigned, Leonard Cohen  This is not a recording that you will listen to once and then put away.  It is, at present,  one of my favorites.  At its price, it is also a bargain.  I do not usually write such positive reviews, or reviews at all, for that matter.  But this recording, with very good audio and video quality, merits acclamation.
B008602KQI|3.0|I liked the movie but I felt it was not as good as people made it out to be is all
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I've admired Mark Cuban for years.  Even though I'm an OKC Thunder fan and pretty much hate the Mavericks.  But this was a great, easy, fast read.  I wish it covered a little more on his early years and the grind to the top.  But it was motivational in its own.  It's an inexpensive read that I will be going back to for years to come.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is my favorite shows. Supernatural is one of the best shows. I love Sam and Dean Winchester. It keeps me in suspense and you never know what's going to happen next. Love it.
B007L24T52|4.0|This novel has made me rethink about Baldacci's writing prowess. Until this I had only read two novels from his John Puller series, and had mostly average thoughts on them. It did not help that John Puller was a caricature of Lee Child's Jack Reacher. But this novel (and I just finished reading the second instalment 'The Hit'), is brilliant. More than the action, adventure, mystery, espionage and spies, and intrigue (all of which by themselves are brilliant in this novel), it is the complex and indepth characterisation of Will Robie, the assassin, that makes this a great read. High quality writing that really pushes the reader in feeling the pulse and emotions of the character. Also, unlike John Puller, Will Robie does things more with his brains than his muscles, which is a key differentiator. Overall, except the length of the novel, a very good and a more mature read!
030796664X|5.0|This book was awesome. I loved hearing all the stories. I used to have a very messy desk. Using what I learned from this book, I am on Day 15 of having a clean desk.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK!!!  I can't say enough about it.  It is so well-written, you get to know and love the characters, and feel what they feel, and...and...*sigh*  You will laugh, and you will cry, and you will fall in love with Holder and want him for your very own self, and who wouldn't want best friends like Six and Brecken-the-Mormon?<br /><br />I love that Ms Hoover came up with &#34;I live you.&#34;  Ingenious!  You should read the book to know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Really, buy this book, it is worth the $3.99 for sure, you won't regret it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is amazing no fee downloads quick easy to use for all ages! Really would recommend this app had no faults with it at all, all my friend's have it who also say it's amazing.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I must say compared to quite a few horror movies that come out, and the trailers are way better than the actual movies. This was one of the exceptions. I found the plot to be very creative, and edge of your seat. There was enough there to keep your interest for even the most hardcore horror fan to want to keep watching till the very end. No blood, or gore throughout but still pretty creepy! The ending is something you will never expect. Overall, I thought it was a great horror movie for any horror fan. Definitely worth seeing compared to most of the mediocre horror movies that come out today.

B003IEJZUG|4.0|Mr. Martel was able to write a great story. It moves right along and at times  it is hard to put the book down. However, I didn't find the book to be life changing nor to augment my faith in God. Of great interest is the chapter about Christianity, Islam and Hinduism religions. I also liked the question the author raises in regards to society in general living a life based purely on facts versus faith. Are our lives out of balance? If you are looking for an incredible adventure, pick up a copy and delve into it.

B008FPOIT6|1.0|The writing is forced, cliches abound, and the ending is sooooooo weak and not worth the struggle it was to get there.

B00AIBZLVY|1.0|This is my first time reviewing a film. Let me start off by saying that i waited impatiently for 7 months to see this movie. The trailer for this film looked incredible and i thought we were finally going to get a really good, unique horror film. I was wrong. The movie started off great and i kept waiting for some kind of plot twist to happen, but it never did. The end of this movie was horrible, nothing at all like how i expected it to be. I have to say that this was by far the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a film. If you want to see a really great horror film, then check out Sinister.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|Highly entertaining. Good acting and out of the norm. Great ending. I would recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates Tarintino type entertainment.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This isn't the cheesy Batman movies you have seen in years before. These are dark and violent the way the stories should have been told. Superb acting by some of the best actors who could have possibly been cast. This is a must-have for any Batman fan, or a fan of great movies! The upgrade for Blu-ray is so worth it. You will not be disappointed.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I found the plot was great but the N word was abused..and I think I got cheated on my 48hr rental..I rented for 5.99 and the next day amazing enough it was 4.99  Gee thanks

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Riveting reading but a bit thin on the real insight into the life of a sniper. Would have enjoyed more info on the facts of the kills, e.g. distance, difficulty, weapon used etc.

B004SBQGHS|3.0|I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about.  It's entertaining but certainly not the 'greatest game I have ever played.'  Play the free version first to see if it's for you.  If you enjoy the game, I do recommend this ad-free version.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is easy to learn and fun to play. I don't really care about the storyline, but it doesn't take away from the game at all. Great for free!
0446698326|5.0|A great addition to my reading library!!  Would recommend it to any Nicholas Sparks fan.<br />Thhanks affording this opporunity to me.<br /><br />The book the Best of Me is another Sparks winner.<br /><br />Your Cup of Cake, cookbook, is wonderful.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|I'll admit, I went into Oblivion with more than a few preconceived notions. I don't think I'm alone in seeing Tom Cruise more as a carefully marketed brand than person or even actor. A Cruise movie pretty much guarantees slick special effects and at least moderately effective storytelling. But it also translates to cautious calculation; so while a Cruise movie is less likely to be an absolute bomb, it also pretty much guarantees the film will be devoid of risks or real surprises.<br /><br />As explained by clunky voiceover narration, Oblivion takes place in 2077. Sixty years earlier an alien race called the Scavengers, or \\"Scavs,\\" as they are more commonly referred, attacked Earth and blew up the moon. Although the human race won the war, Earth was left inhospitable and mankind has relocated to an orbiting space station until enough of the earth's resources have been harvested to make it to a new home on Saturn's moon, Titan.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a maintenance worker and one of the last humans on earth. Oblivion takes its time presenting Cruise's day to day life on a barren futuristic world, and the film seriously benefits from the time. Director Joseph Kosinski presents both the advanced technology and ravaged landscapes with a sparse elegance that conjures a kind of wonder harkening back to the golden age of science fiction.<br /><br />Of course, it's only a matter of time before Cruise's routine is interrupted by some nasty encounters with the Scavs and the drones he's assigned to maintain. As the plot unfolds, what's most surprising isn't how tired or cliched the twists are, but how inoffensively the movie treads well worn ground. At times it feels like you could play spot the reference: a bit of Philip K. Dick here, a touch of Stanley Kubrick there. But the movie is often so in touch with the spirit of its genre that it feels classically science fiction without ever coming close to being a classic piece of science fiction. It's only in the film's third act that things really start to come unraveled with confusing leaps in the plot's logic and paint by numbers action sequences.<br /><br />But the film's biggest problem is the acting. For a movie whose crux is the concept of humanity, Oblivion is very light on emotion. Cruise's Jack Harper spends most of the movie teetering between stoic hero and vapid cardboard cutout, preferring to outright state his feeling rather than express them. In dealing with heavy concepts like identity and memory, Oblivion seems poised in its early scenes to enter the heady, often anxious thematic universe of Philip K. Dick and Andre Tarkovskiy. But Cruise's character seems relatively immune to the weight of each plot turn, and the film itself either misses or doesn't care to chase the implications of Cruise's love interests.<br /><br />Despite its problems, Oblivion is thoroughly entertaining and always pleasing to the eye. It's a good movie to ease into the summer season with: giving its audience what they came for, but nothing more.ilm's third act that things really start to come unraveled with confusing leaps in the plot's logic and paint by numbers action sequences.<br /><br />But the film's biggest problem is the acting.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hurry up and get season 3!  I loved seasons 1 and two.  Such an awesome program.  Worth watching and even worth buying.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I already had this movie, but this version is in wide screen, and you really need to get this movie in wide screen, or else you miss a lot in the opening sequence.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great for those who want a case that looks a little different from the rest and has a more modern and minimalist style (i.e., not a bedazzled Hello Kitty). I've received a few compliments on it. Prior to this case, I broke my screen THREE TIMES. Yes, I'm klutzy. I have had this case for over a year now ... I've dropped my phone quite a few times and it still hasn't broken (knock on wood)! I have not used the screen protector that came with the case. Fits tightly around your phone, yet it's pretty easy to take off for cleaning.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|as a dedicated Allman Brothers fance since 1969 I had high expactations! And the whole package blew me away!!!A great collection<br />from a awesome guitarist/slideplayet! I visited<br />the Allman Brothers museum in februari( thanks<br />EJ!!!) and it was overwhelming.as this great boxset!!! \\"the road goes on forever indeed\\"
B00APUYWYA|4.0|And got something way more awesome! I was truly hesitant to rent this and was worried it was going to be a teen comedy with cheesy Glee writing. Is it geared towards teens? Probably. Does it have singing? Yup. But it's pretty hilarious, even for adults. It actually has some adult humor, on par with Bridesmaids (thank you, Rebel Wilson!). I rarely watch movies twice, let alone buy them, and I'm considering buying this one.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|We love Angry birds. However the constant adds that pop up are annoying. Game runs fine. Over addicting. Lots of fun. Just don't like ads.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This is a depressing movie. I get that the concept should be about how depressing midlife can be, but this story line was just painful. Sure, there were some funny parts, but we generally were waiting (and waiting) for the movie to turn around and to see a silver lining through all of the angst. Alas, we were disappointed at the end. I agree with the other folks -- this really doesn't have anything to do with Knocked Up.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Stormlight Archive series has the potential to be an instant classic if the first book \\"The Way of Kings\\" is any indication.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I was looking for a fun dragon app because I'm in to How to Train your Dragon and Eragon and mythological creatures in general. My friend then suggested Dragonvale and I immediately fell in love with it. I check it almost every night and I have very rare dragons. I'll be nice to you and say how to breed a bronze Olympus dragon. Breed the willow dragon and the Crystal dragon. It takes along time in the breeding den and hatchery, but it's worth it. Anyway, I love this app! I recommend it.

B004H0M8EA|3.0|Diamond has a good handle on his subject matter (as per usual) but goes on a bit much for me. Does a great job of balancing environmental causes with the human need to exist and profit (at least, feels fairly even-handed to me), but just goes on a bit long, especially re: Greenland and the Vikings, an area where - perplexingly enough - there's really not all that much data, if Diamond is to be believed.<br /><br />Still, a good point and a rather worrying one overall!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I wish more people got into this than Lost... it was great and funny when it needed to be. I think however it ended on a good note, before it got all cheesy and lame.

0812993357|5.0|This is a fast read, well written and entertaining.  I am not a fashionista, but I enjoyed an insider's view of the scene. \\"The Cod\\" has a droll sense of humor and loves cats.<br />That's good enough for me.
B00CDT5ML8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from The Following. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. It's so unlike any other cop show out there and the acting is fantastic, along with the story line. I love that it's centered around a serial killer and the dynamic of his followers. The people are so crazy, it's brilliant.
B00002SSKI|5.0|One of my favorite movies, ever. Surprised that it's cheaper on DVD than on VHS, but I'm not complaining. Great film for teens or tweens.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|It was hard to wait for this one but the final battle was worth seeing. In the final part of the first half, Voldemort finally attained the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. In this part, the search for the Horcruxes led to breaking into the almost impregnable Gringott's Bank with the help of the Goblin Griphook in exchange for the Sword of Griffindor, but Griphook betrays the group, leaving them inside the vault after taking the Sword. They manage to break out by freeing a dragon guardian. Their next move leads them back to Hogwarts where another is hidden.In their return, Severus Snape, the new headmaster faces and loses a challenge to Professor McGonnagal and is driven from the castle.

B000002G89|3.0|I originally heard this album at a friends house in 1977 when I was 17.  Mostly in my life even back then if it wasn't at least a little country I wouldn' t listen to it.  I knew the song I Shot The Sheriff.  But when I heard this record it suprised me that I liked it.  Then I went out and bought it.  It is still to this day the only thing I have by Eric Clapton.  My favorite song is Let It Grow.  Motherless Children, Give Me Strength, and Willie And The Hand Jive are the first three songs and they are all good.  The rest of the album is good as well.  With Mainline Florida being another highlight,
B005G4TJUC|4.0|It was discovered that the first moon landing had a secret mission, to discover what had landed there and they discovered the Ark, an Autobot starcraft that had crashed carrying a supposed secret weapon. After launching an investigation, they discovered Sentinel Prime, Optimus' mentor on board and revive him. Sentinel has both a warning and an ulterior motive, to take over the Earth and use its power to revive Cybertron, and he is in league with Megatron. He tricks Optimus and company into a spaceship forcing the Autobots off the Earth and Shockwave proceeds to take over Chicago while Megatron takes over Washington DC to force the inhabitants to build a space bridge to bring Cybertron to Earth. As it turns out, Prime has used a trick of his own to return to help the people of Earth fight the Decepticons and return Cybertron to where it was. While it was good it could have been better. It had potential to be.

B0034G4P80|5.0|While the setting of Asgard was a bit over the top perhaps, the story was good and in some places even funny. Odin is about to name the next king of Asgard, grooming both Thor and Loki to princely duties, but Loki's little prank goes awry when the Frost giants raid the treasury to try to retake the Casket of Winters. They are destroyed, and Odin is willing to dismiss it, but Thor is not, and leads a raid to Jotunheim to seek revenge, against his father's wishes. It is through Odin's intersession that the battle ends, but not amiably as King Laufy chooses to declare war on Asgard. It is in this battle that Loki learns his true heritage, that he is the son of King Laufy, discarded by Laufy, found by Odin and raised in Asgard.  . Because Thor in his arrogance, disobeyed him, he stripped him of his power and cast him from Asgard, until either he, or someone else can prove worthy to use Mjolnir,the magic hammer. Loki, in the meantime, demands to know more about how he came to be, and because Odin did not choose him to be the king, and Laufy discarded him,decides to take vengeance on both Laufey and Odin when Odin takes ill and falls into an enchanted sleep. Since Odin is asleep, Loki assumes the throne and leads the way for Laufey so that he may at last kill Odin while he is helpless. Thor on the other hand has problems of his own. Slamming into Midgard from above, he is anything but subtle. Taken to a hospital, he proves to be anything but the ideal patient and it is only through Jane Foster and her father that he manages to settle down so that he can try to find his hammer. He finds it, but so have others and SHIELD has surrounded it and taken all the scientific handiwork that Jane and her father had. It is when he fails to lift his hammer does he realize the truth. He must prove himself worthy once again or he will remain forever earthbound. This particular Thor is part of the Marvel Comics universe, but it is an interesting story in its own right and a fun romp through Marvel's version of Norse Mythology.

B008ROGZUU|1.0|Now, I believe this is the new ROH production which comes to replace the famous Jefirrelli one. I am not an admirer of the past, but if you have something good in your hands, you do not touch it unless you have something to say. The huge problem here is the Scarpia character which the director portrays as a SLOB. Well, I am sorry, but Scarpia was everything but a slob. He was a fascist man-of-the-church type of bastard but a CLEAN CUT one and it was exactly this CONTRAST that made him even more terryfing and repulsive. Here you have a man that , quite frankly,looks like a mess, some sort of a marginal drunk that has just walked out of a London pub. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Terfel is indeed a terrific talent and does his best. But this is a character failure and his work is wasted. Then you have Angela Gheorghiu. Now, Angela Gheorghiu, if you examine the facts solely on the theatrical side, IS Tosca. Diva-ish, nervous, terribly insecure. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED if she were like that in real life. BUT she has a SMALL VOICE. To sing Tosca you have to be either a dramatic soprano (like Callas) or a lyrico-spinto one (like Price) and Ms Gheorghiu is neither of the two. So under the heavy Puccini orchestration she is struggling to be heard. She is aware of this fact and that adds up to her nervousness which makes her all the more like Tosca (visually). It is no wonder that she does so many cancellations. She wants to protect her voice against a very heavy repertoire that she so often chooses in order to make a great career. Despite her weak instrument, she is an intelligent and expressive artist with exemplary phrasing. Pappano does his best to help her out, but, after all, he has to do his job and conduct Puccini. Puccini is easier than bel canto in that the singer is not as exposed, but you have to have a strong voice and Ms Gheorghiu doesn't. And last but not least, we have Mr Kaufmann. Now, the guy is again visually a very convincing Mario. He is sexy and goodlooking which in itself justifies the jealousy felt by Tosca. He is also a very good actor succeeding in giving to the public the romantic and self-sacrificing nature of Mario. BUT he has the WRONG VOICE. And we thought that Domingo sounded like a baritone!!! Well, Kaufmann makes Domingo sound like a light tenor. He has a very dark, heavy and baritonal instrument which again leads to a character failure. You don't expect Mario to sound as heavy as this and Kaufmann CANNOT lighten his voice at all. But of course he takes on roles like this because nobody made a great career on Strauss and Wagner exclusively. So, to sum it all up, in my humble opinion, this is far from being a great Tosca. I would of course recommend it to anyone that is a fan of these singers and wants to enjoy an excellent blu ray picture. But it is a production hit by all the problems I described above. A much better alternative to my taste and mind is the Dessi-Armiliato Tosca sold by Amazon ASIN: B006UM05IO .

0062238868|3.0|I have really mixed feelings about this book and its author. I had been wanting to read it for awhile, but my interest spiked after reading that Kyle was murdered at a gun range recently. I mean, he was a Navy sniper, the best ever in the US military, so the irony of his murder is beyond description.<br /><br />The book is really interesting to read, I must admit. There are many tales of his battles in Fallujah and Ramadi, as well as other places. (He was deployed to Iraq four times.) The description of his SEAL training was pretty intense. And the book starts out with his first sniper kill, a woman with a grenade. All told, he killed some 160 insurgents while over there, which admittedly is quite a few.<br /><br />That being said, he seems to revel in the murder of other human beings, most of whom he refers to as “savages.” He was great at this job, but he loved to kill, and that made him rather unlikeable to me. He wanted to kill as many of the enemy as he could and was disappointed he couldn’t kill more. Not a very nice human being. He also struck me as woefully naive (and Republican) in defending the war, of invading a sovereign country to “liberate” its inhabitants (after asserting there were indeed chemical weapons there, which I don’t believe) and ending up shooting a ton of them who resented his presence in their country. Instead, he asserts this was to defend America and its freedoms. That’s BS, in my opinion. Iraq posed no threat to the US and played no role in terrorism — until we invaded. That’s a proven fact. So, his defense of the war rings hollow, and as I said, naive. (I wonder what he thought of Obama as commander in chief. I can pretty much guess….)<br /><br />Another thing I didn’t like about the author is the number of fights he gets into and glorifies. He loves bar fights and brags about getting out of being arrested countless times. He brags about the SEALs beating up bar patrons in fights left and right. It’s really rather sickening. He also enjoys hazing new SEALs. The thing that truly sickens me is his countless assertions that God comes number one in his life, that he’s a born again Christian. Yet he uses the “F” word more than any Christian I’ve encountered and engages in many non-Christian acts. He seems like a total hypocrite to me. On page 431, he declares, “I am a strong Christian…. I believe the fact that I’ve accepted Jesus as my savior will be my salvation.” Yet on the same page, he said that while growing up, he wondered, “how would I feel about killing someone?” He answers he own question next by writing, “Now I know. It’s no big deal.” Seriously? Think God feels that way Chris? He ends the book by writing, “…when God confronts me with my sins, I do not believe any of the kills I had during the war will be among them. Everyone I shot was evil. I had good cause on every shot. They all deserved to die.” Really? Seriously? And you’re a strong Christian??? Cause that’s not how I view Jesus as seeing things. I don’t think they all deserved to die. They’re children of God, just like everyone else. You invaded their country and came to kill them. If they shoot at you, that’s what you get. What a complete hypocrite.<br /><br />So even though this book was moderately enjoyable, I can only give it three stars because the author is totally unlikeable and the book reeks of smugness. Also, his wife interjects repeatedly throughout the book, which might be interesting to some people, but which irritated me. She didn’t seem too likeable either, frankly. She’s a bitter woman. I wonder how she feels now that he’s dead at the hands of a deranged US gunman…? I cautiously recommend this book, but be prepared to read some ugliness.her sickening.

0451213092|5.0|Now this is a five star book if I’ve ever read one! I couldn’t put this book down. It was an amazing story told masterfully by Ken Follett. In looking over some reviews, I was surprised to see a couple of bad reviews with one saying it was not exciting. Are you kidding me??? This was one of the most exciting books I’ve ever read — and it’s a true story! This book was one of the most engaging books I’ve ever read. The poor reviews complained about too much detail. Well, I appreciated the detail. It made it seem all the more problematic in the rescue effort, and thus even more incredible that it was accomplished. This book was written in 1983, and Bull Simons is dead now, and I have no idea what’s happened to the others in this book, but I didn’t take Perot seriously when he ran for president. I sure would now. What a leader! I loved Bill Clinton and have no regrets in voting for him, but who knows where we might be if Perot had led America? This is a stunning book to read and I give it my highest recommendation.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I am quite a Civil War buff, so, of course, Lincoln plays a major role in anything I read or see about that period in our history..  I feel that Mr. Speilberg truly captured the true feelings that Lincoln had regarding many things, but especially slavery.  My only complaint would be that the movie was so dark.  I realize that in those days they did not have the bright interior lighting of today, but perhaps a little poetic license to lighten things up would not have been out of order.
B008FOB124|5.0|I think Anastasis is Dead Can Dance's most complete album, and thus their best one overall. Honestly, there's not a weak song on the album, and many, many strong ones. It's consistently good. My favorites are &#34;Anabasis,&#34; &#34;Amnesia,&#34; and &#34;Opium.&#34; Still, you can't go wrong with any song. These songs sound rich and well constructed. When there are lyrics, they're very good. When Lisa is singing, it's joyful and beautiful. I was fortunate to see them on tour supporting this album (second row!), and they played most of the songs from Anastatis. The songs fit in quite well with their more classic material. You can't go wrong in getting this album. Highly recommended.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love it. Just wish I could have unlimited money for free. My kids love it too and play it on their Kindles.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is an amazing book.  Not your usual Zombie fare.  The Zombies could be any enemy, except that when one of your side dies he becomes an enemy.  Each chapter is a post-war interview with various people throughout the world.  It deals with the emotions of war, the after-effects, various strategies, war on land, sea and air. The economy, the loss of a currency, abandoned children, You could have put any enemy in place of the Zombies and get the same story.  It was moving and intense and sad and will hopefully teach us that no wins a war.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is a book that should be mandatory reading for all World History students.  Yes, Germany committed atrocities during World War II and my father gave three years of his young life to fight during these years.  I have been to Berchtesgaden and the hair stood up on the back of my neck knowing Hitler probably walked where I was walking, but there were many in Germany who opposed his rule.  A Higher Call points out how the fear and mistrust surrounding everyone in Nazi Germany caused a society to turn not only on the Jews, but their own people.  This book also brings to light the indomitable spirit of man when faced with life or death decisions.  It was great to know that two young men - raised by Christian parents - were able to draw from that faith and love their fellow man - in spite of the gulf of war.  That is why the WWII generation has been called the Greatest Generation.  We need these kind of heros today!  Thanks for bringing them to life, Mr. Makos.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|For some reason, it didn't get as much fanfare as it should have when it was in the theaters.  The movie was outstanding.  It should not be compared to the other Judge Dredd movie based on the graphic novel of the same name.  This is a standalone movie and stands very well.  Karl Urban's performance is above par.  Cinematography is unique and interwoven in the story.<br /><br />See it and judge for yourself.

Great story line.  Have to say this is probably my favotite (so far) of this type of game. Lots of help if you need it which I did not. Now I am afraid it's going to be hard for the next game to stand up! Hope you all have as much fun as I did.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I was very excited about reading this book after looking at all of the reviews. I have read the &#34;Bared to You&#34;, &#34;This Man&#34; and &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; series. This was recommended to me from the site Good Reads.<br /><br />I didn't think there was enough passion displayed in the book! The main character was a virgin, and I was hoping for more after her first time with Travis. Wanted the author to display more emotion from Abby! It's usually a huge deal when you lose your virginity and I def didn't get that in the book. I also thought the storyline about her dad, was stupid. Just thought there were a lot of loose ends that needed to be written better or explained more in depth. Thought of it as a teen type of book.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It was okay but a little hard for my 4 yr. old. Think it was okay for me but really needed stuff for my granddaughter
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you like Bingo, you will love this game. Once you become familiar with the power - ups, items, and rooms, it's a lot of fun.
B006KAPMZW|3.0|DeVere as the true bard is not a new idea, but in Anonymous the theory is presented in great detail with lavish decoration and eye-catching scenery captured beautifully by the photographer and brought to life by a fine cast. The movie has just enough of the plays in question to make it worthwhile and a look at how audiences of the day might have reacted to the dramas is especially intriguing. Derick Jacobi with contemporary on-stage introduction and epilogue is most effective. Supporters of Shakespeare's case as bard will not like him depicted as ham actor and clown. Whatever the story's truths, anyone who loves a good literary mystery and political intrigue will find compelling elements in Anonymous.
B000WYCF6Q|3.0|If you want a simple, cheap, mirror, this does the trick. I like that it's rugged and compact. The lens is small and made of plastic, so don't expect a beautiful view from it, but it works well enough to quickly determine whether there's a vehicle approaching.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read Me Before You based upon Amazon's recommendation and my experience with another work by this author. I found the story to be very powerful. I became caught up with the interaction between the two main characters and the development of their relationship. Ms. Moyes made me think long and hard about the difficulties a wheelchair-bound person faces on a daily basis and how, ultimately, regardless of the care and love others heap upon that individual, it is that person's life and he or she should be allowed to have a say in the outcome of their life. Ms. Moyes also made me think about the power of love and how complex an emotion it is. I am still thinking about this book and I suspect I will for some time to come.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|After the Oscar hype, and Jennifer Lawrence winning.  I just had to read the book, and then watch the movie (of course!)<br /><br />I must say that the book was better than expected, it is such a fast and entertaining read.  Pat Peoples is trying to be a kind person in general, and fix his life to regain his life with his wife... but he gets further an furher away - and trying to figure out why such turn of events become his challenge.<br />There was a bit more football description in this book that I expected, not a fan a football so I would skip few paragraphs... but overall I would certainly recommend this book as a feel good story, where even when you want a happy ending - you sometime get what you did not know you really wanted in the first place.<br /><br />I would recommend you read the book first before the movie...movie is great, but not as good as the book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO DOPE!!! Just putting that out there. I've seen the pc version and trust me, this versions scarier. First he just pops up AND chases you. Secondly, it gives you a sort of old monolith monsters feel. The only bad thing is falling through the map, but that's all.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best app but the problem is that it gets weird. it just freezes every second which drives me crazy.
B008KZVNFS|5.0|So moving and wonderful. One of the best shows I've ever watched.<br /><br />I was able to stay on Team Sylvia...until the tree. There was no forgiveness after the tree.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Another well-crafted Bigelow film. But unlike her last movie, I found no one to like in this movie. I suppose we must have dark ops run by dark people driven by dark obsessions. I suppose it's impossible to say whether the nature of the dark ops culture creates this black-minded, grotesquely competent tribe, or whether that's the kind of person drawn to it. Most likely some of both. But like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men pointed out: Though their existence may be grotesque to us, we want them on that wall.<br /><br />One minor irritation with the film. The screenwriter seemed determined to insert as many f-bombs into the script as possible. No character was exempted from his determination. In my life, I meet all kinds of people--from the intensely profane to the refined and civil. Evidently this screenwriter lives (or wants to live) in a world in which the level of discourse is universally coarse. I suppose writing dialogue with actual adjectives is just too much work.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy this game. took me awhile to figure out exactly how to play it and what to do to get to the next levels . would be better if the instructions were more detailed.
0618918248|4.0|Very engaging book and a great read! I found myself nodding in agreement and chuckling with Dawkins frequently.<br /><br />Dawkins is, of course, almost unbelievably arrogant and condescending.  I opted to find charm in it, though I imagine that if one had to deal with him on a personal level it could be rather intolerable. I'm guessing his family life has been a little bumpy?<br /><br />I am tempted to write a long commentary, but many have responded quite aptly and I'm not sure I have too much to add. Just two comments/questions:<br /><br />1) Is it possible Dawkins has not read William James? If he did, he did not understand him. Dawkins intellect and breadth of understanding may be several notches below that of James, but that should not render James inaccessible.<br /><br />2) It is amusing (and a little frustrating) that the Dawkins tribe absolutely refuses to consider the possibility that there is any other way to &#34;know&#34; than pure scientific rationality. And since they are classic &#34;Flatlanders&#34; with no apparent ability to experience a  dimension that is quite real to all non-Flatlanders, one wastes time and breath trying to help them see it otherwise. If James can't do it, I'm not going to try!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|OMG, This book was chilling.  Portions of it keep coming to mind even though I read it over a month ago.!
B00005AXJR|4.0|Thank you so much I was really looking everywhere for this movie the box was smelly... but great movie && no scratches on anything thanks so much.. It played just great in my laptop good purchase,, I was disappointed @ first because it did not play in my dvd players but its all good now that I can watch it on my hp thanks so much
B00BF11STU|5.0|There is very little political content, lots of detailed background behind historical events. Excellent graphics, very realistic, the acting is great.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Runs good,good graphics,all around a good game. Even for 7 bucks it's a good buy it does take 1.5 gigs so make sure you have that much
B005OZE9SA|3.0|I have a problem with Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 on Mac. It's plays normal but then after some period of time (can be 1 day, can be just 30min) it start making crackles and bad noises and then sound completely disappear. If I go to audio settings and change rate from 44,100 Hz to 48,000 Hz and back it's kind of reboots the scarlett and it is working again. It's very annoying.<br />I have latest drivers. Tried with connecting with external powered usb HUB. Still the same.
1843104954|5.0|i bought this before i was going to go in for my aspergers diagnosis. as an adult, and as an aspie, i loved the technical, specific information the book gives. i highlighted passages that i found relevant to me, and it was a great book to help support me in my journey. i was diagnosed last summer! i loved the book overall, and anyone who thinks or is involved with someone who has or may have aspergers should read this book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have my whole family hooked on Downton Abbey.  We are catching up on Season Three and we love it.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This was a great buy for me. I got all favorite alien movies in one, thank you for a great movie
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was everything I had hoped it would be. In the words of Oswin Oswald, &#34;It was too beautiful to live.&#34;<br /><br />I recommend this book strongly!
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I was a little nervous getting this album, because I haven't listened to the Killers is forever, but i decided i would go for it and i am SOO glad i did they have a new, refined sound, not that there was anything wrong with there old sound, and they still have some songs that remind me of they way they used to be. highly recommended!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I get that he's slowing it down and changing up his style but I love the JT that you can dance to...not this Robin Thicke style he's doing.
0738212415|5.0|I was looking for a beginners book that taught the fundamentals of drawing. There were a lot of \\"beginners\\" books I looked at that really were not for beginners, or beyond my level. They failed to tell you why your doing certain things, or jumped to advanced concepts without preparing you for it.<br /><br />Mark's book was the perfect fit for me. It covers the basic shapes, shading, then goes in to perspective and ends with drawing the human face. The book has a very relaxed tone, and at the end of the chapter has you experiment with what you learned, and shows you examples of some of his students with there end of chapter experiment. The book also doesn't obsess with drawing supplies as I've seen in other books about which lead type to use, or canvas for each example. The focus is getting the concepts down. He also has a site where you can sign up<br /><br />This book isn't a complete how to draw but gives you a solid foundation to build and grow from.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|A movie about irresponsible people raising their kids irresponsibly was depressing.  It seemed like the writers thought the poor parenting was funny and that the audience would agree.  A messy movie that went all over the place and left me feeling worried that our society doesn't think there's any problem with people acting this way.  I dunno, all I really wanted was some laughs.
B007EW9ISM|1.0|Even with the replacement tip from Studio Neat, there is little precision to the Cosmonaut writing/drawing on the iPad. Requires way too much downward pressure to register. Disappointed. :(
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|While I preferred the musical renditions in the musicals, it was great to have the full story spelled out more clearly in the movie (for the benefit of those who were watching the movie with me who had not read the book).
B008MEM24S|4.0|A fun game for ages 8-88. My son enjoys the puzzle solving as do I. I have a hard time putting this game down.
0786182466|5.0|Based on a true life in a real way.<br />This book will make you want to go see his statue.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A highly unlikely story, but a good read and likeable characters. IT was an easy and quick read. I enjoyed it.
1476734941|4.0|Very good information for anyone desiring a practical approach to losing weight and improving your health. The approach is not as harsh as the title implies.
B002MJM8B6|5.0|I bought the album &#34;The Truth is...&#34; and had to have more of Theory. I love this album! There isn't a song on here that I don't like.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great storyline, with complex characters. The vivid descriptions in the book really brings the whole thing alive. It will be fascinating to watch how the story of the 7 Kingdoms unfolds in the next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the movie I HAD to read the book, and of course the rest of the series. Well written, keeps you engaged and wanting to know what happens next.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My grandson turned me on to this game and its so much fun.  I got to the second shark before he did.
B0050PLT96|5.0|Got the clean version so I could play it in front of my kids.<br />Very catchy and the tongue-n-cheek lyrics.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game .  It has many levels and gets harder and harder each level. I really enjoy this game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is so sad that there is so much abuse in the world that we live in.  I totally understand why Katie left her husband.  I love how she found herself and a new life.
B00C1C123E|1.0|This was absolutely painful. I am not sure if Spielberg was just looking for a check, but he definitely mailed this one in.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I was really looking forward to this series. It seemed dark, disturbing, and unique. However it is completely unrealistic to the point of comic. Some of the incidents that happen make the FBI look completely inept, which of course is not true. The serial killer was interesting for awhile, but I just couldn't take his foil, Kevin Bacon, seriously after a few episodes. The alcoholic/retired but coming back storyline is very overplayed and it was disappointing to see it again. Unfortunately, the network had a good premise but failed to execute it well.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Nice disco soul to it. I really dig the Nile Rogers mixing it up with DP. Both him, Pharrel and DP come together to make you wanna dance. Putting the flavor back into dance/electronic music.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! Very loyal to the story and very haunting. Would definitely recommend it to all SK fans.
B008602KQI|4.0|However, the movie was not that great. I thought there would be more character development but that did'nt happen. So overall just an average movie.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and decided it is a classic to add to my limited movie collection
B005LAIIHG|3.0|average when it could have been great. the special effects were fantastic and there was a lot of good aspects to the movie, I just shouldn't have read the book first.
B00009R86L|5.0|I bought this to use with my ski bag while on a ski trip to Innsbruck.  It worked great!  I used it like a messenger so I still had 2 hands free to caryy other things.  Getting through the airport, I could carry my ski bag over my shoulder, and still tote 2 pieces of luggage!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Game is great!! Very addicting. Wish they would explain more in the tutorial about bonuses. However most of the lower level upgrades are worthless. If you want to advance faster focus on military and oil not gold.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Apple's proprietary lightning connector is a pain if you have old devices that utilize the old 30 pin connector. I bought the apple Lightning to 30 pin adapter, which partially worked allowing me to get audio through my various devices like my Pioneer car and home receiver. But charging wasn't working at all.<br /><br />Well this adapter did the trick! Now when I plug my Iphone 5 into my car receiver everything works! I get audio and it charges my phone so I don't have to worry about a dead battery when I leave my car!<br /><br />It's a little pricey, but it seems almost every Apple aftermarket product is pricey nowadays.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The author really seemed to know his way around the space program and N.A.S.A.<br />This story held me captive until the iminent rescue. I thought all the science and<br />problem solving would be boring but it really enhanced the story.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|don't know the books or character,but grandaughter is named after her,hope she likes it, sha is 5 months young,but does watch tv, videos,and SESAME STREET
B00340ESIS|5.0|He says it like it is. I've been through workshops and seminars, classes, and read other books, and Snyder's book breaks it down so practically along with the theoretical. It's a great manual I will review over and over.<br /><br />I am surprised by some aspects, like the page he puts act breaks (which were taught slightly differently in seminars) and that he does not recommend screenplay competitions.<br /><br />I now need to go back to my 16 screenplays and make sure they adhere to Snyder's wisdom. Hopefully it will be the kick they need to sell.
B0015AARJI|5.0|built well. the orginal one didnt break i smashed it on the floor in frustration . so i had to replace it with another. great controller has always done the job when no abused .
1596354208|5.0|this book is great for beginners, i love each projects that were presented...found new ways to apply to my own bead work.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Cute critters but without friends to help or real money to spend it gets harder to fulfill the quests.  Luckily the games are easy and if you are in no hurry, you can gradually build up enough kibble to buy a house for the next pet.  A good time killer/filler.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good book but not great.  Connelly usually has more complex plots.  I enjoyed it but not to the point that I liked his other books.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The film reviewers were right about this one.  It's epic.<br />There's nothing more to say that hasn't already been said
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read all of Baldacci's books and enjoyed them thoroughly.  His books pick you up and transports into the story
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|I have been reading the Honor series in paperback for years.  It was like finding an old friend to see Honor available on my Kindle.  I cant wait for the rest of the books in the series to show up.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Purchased for my sweetie pie and he loves it.<br />Great CD to listen to in the car on the way to a weekend getaway.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I wanted to go hiking right after I read this. I think Cheryl Stayed is a very brave women that did something that most people in general only think about. Bravo!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is very good and works very good It has a nice long cord and reaches any where in the room
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you are religous or not Dr. Alexander makes a compeling case that there is life after death.<br />I enjoyed this book very much.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|I thought it was really good..4.5 stars...pretty cool that it's based on a true story.  I wish there were more people in the world willing to reach out like this guy did.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I like Linked In on my computer and the access to all of their content. I wish the Kindle version could access more of this site, like the questions and job search functions.
093183841X|5.0|perfect my husband donated over 200 old cameras to FINE ART CENTER camera class they are thrilled .they do roll film processing .sorry he gave them the book also
0061733199|5.0|Covered Everything Imaginable, really worth reading. I would recommend for preppers, survivalists, campers, anyone who may live outdoors, those people who don't know about survival methods
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Thank u very much it was a really good movie worth every penny awesome story about a beautiful woman with an interesting life
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I love it. Good product flawless image quality. The only thing in the first movie does not appear Spanish Language Latino. The rest Excellente.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is amazing. No wait beyond that. It involves love and romance. Wait there boys I hope I haven't lost you all ready it involves a crime of a murder or suicide. Figure out yourself if it's murder or suicide.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Good prodructo, excellent image quality. Amazing History. excellent. fascinated with the image resolution and quality of the product, very accordance
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was a very good read. The story of two men, enemies, who's lives were very parallel. A must read.
0920668372|5.0|I purchased this book for my son when he was little, now I purchased it for my Grand baby's. love it, love it love, great way to give a love message
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|The video was excellent and the value was top of the line. The item was shipping so expeditiously that I was surprised at how fast it arrived. I recommend this Hitchcock movie for the entire family. It is superbly directed and produced and truly one of the all time best movies for intrigue and suspense. This is a must for your library.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I love this idea and the book has a lot of info in it,but I have read a lot on fasting so I had heads up on it, I must admit it needed to show a weekly fasting plan.......I read it that you fasted for 2x 24 hour periods to start but this is because I've read so much about it but it actually means fast from the night before and the whole next day,so have your normal dinner then go to bed fast all day the next day go to bed and then wake and eat..... I got confused as some fasts in other books are 14-18 hours so it really needed a plan put into the book as a diagram. But all the info is great in this book it's intrigued me and I'm testing it and eating as bad as I can on non fast days for one month to see what I loose then I'm going to eat good for a month with the odd fun stuff,but I've been pretty bad and my cravings have stopped,I have to force myself to eat shyte which is un heard of in my world:-) I've eaten TA and chocolate etc and I've still lost 3.2kg in three weeks so bring on the good month............
B001DM1VXE|1.0|A meaningless collection of images shot in a lowlife apartment whose only interesting character is a little girl who gives the boring main character numbers to calculate in his head.  You will discover the most boring of movies ever to wish it had a cohesive script.  Do not waste your time, it would be better spent wiping your arse.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not the strongest writting this season.<br /><br />Great to purchase on Amazon Instant watch/down load.<br /><br />Great quality even at standard definition.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the sound quality. & that could be in the streaming.  I actuallythought it was better than ARGO and may be should have been Best Picture!  Chastain was fabulous!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I was skepticle when I herd that they were addapting this story to the screen, thought they'd make it to G rated.  Not the case, this is probobly the most adult, and intense annimation I have seen come out of DC Direct, or Marvel Animated yet.  The release timming highlights the story paralels between this and the final Christin Bale film.<br /><br />Is it too expensive? YES<br />Is it worth it? YES<br /><br />If/When Part's 1 & 2 are released together, buy it!  otherwise I'd rent it, and enjoy.
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|Simons cat gets a new friend. Simon takes in a homeless kitten and if you thought Simons cat got into a lot of stuff just wait till you see what Simons kitten gets into. They have all kinds of adventures. The play with the neighbors dog, they play with the hedgehogs, they let the bunnies out, they scare the birds. Guaranteed to make you smile and laugh out loud.
B00170M2JY|4.0|This movie is a classic!!! My wife and I enjoyed it on our date night. I would recommend this for any date night.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Interesting story line.  Wonder how many militia units there may be within the US.  Kind of scary, and wonder how realistic.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I chose the cable from amazon as I needed a second cable for another room.  This way I don't have to keep moving my adapter from room to room.  Purchased the power adapter as well.
1451695195|4.0|Conversational style makes good reading, and technical info adds validity. I'm still reading it!  It holds my interest, and I'll recommend it.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|This is a great product. Great price for great quality.<br /><br />However... Anker should include an AC charger in the package.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! It is one of the one great free games on the app store that doesn't ask you to do stuff you don't want to do. The one problem I have is that the piano blade is annoying because it makes just random notes whenever you slice a fruit and I just wish that the piano blade would play a song when it slices.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Love this book, especially being a server in this industry had me rolling. Plus I have a major crush on Tony, odd I know but something about his ass-wholish demeanor just does it for me lol.
B006RXQ2CY|4.0|Makes you think about walking in other people's shoes.  Made me want to go back and re-read some of the news printed at that time.
B0095P33IW|5.0|very well done I would tell anyone who likes action and adventure moves to watch this one.  it was very good
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Fun to see Lincoln in such a human and tangible way.  Also an interesting reflection on history, where we've been and how far we've come in 150 years.
0156012197|5.0|The wonderful illustrations took me back to when my mother read the book to me as a child. Great buy.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|I'm just not a fan of the bizarre and unexplained.  The acting is good enough but the story is weird.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Makes me want to go and adopt a dog. I have a renewed love for pets. It is an amazing book.
B0046H95RM|3.0|As a murder-mystery, started out very excitingly and kept interest to almost the very end. Trying not to give away any spoilers, I suppose it could have ended without an explanation, adding to the mystery, but I suppose that one would feel deprived of the resolution and wonder whether it would have been feasible at all (to pull off all these murders).<br /><br />I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but I suppose it's closer to 3 than 4.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I didn't think Jeremy Brett's performance of Sherlock Holmes could be beat but Benedict Cumberbatch just edges him out!  They are both outstanding in their own way but I really enjoy the modern take on this old story!  Very well done!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|An entertainingly light bit of fluff to read. As a fan of the show Castle, I found this novel to be a fun tie-in, giving some pretty interesting insight as to how the Castle character views the people around him.<br /><br />Especially interesting is his characterization of 'himself' in the form of the journalist \\"Rook\\". A must-read for fans of the Castle tv show and a fairly solid crime thriller besides.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|If you want to feel very, very depressed, hear a lot of unnecessary cursing, and see nudity, this is the movie for you! If not, just say no!!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|OK....sometimes it is nice to watch a funy comedy without expecting it to have this deep content. IT is a comedy and it is real. It deals with real things that happen in life and it is light and fun to watch....Parenting, getting old, dealing with family and finances is hard and this movie makes it a little more fun to go through all that....
111846446X|5.0|I had first thought this book was little light on information.  I had followed the method to install Apache that I found on ELinux, and I couldn't get the PHP part to work on my Pi.  I read through the section on the networking in Raspberry Pi User Guide, and the method that was described did work. The explanations, and the information in the book is well worth the price.
B00846REIS|5.0|Read this book in a very short amount of time. Couldn't put it down. Will most likely be one of those that get read a couple of times.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book deserves an audience broader than those who love the science-fiction genre.  For instance, if you have ever enjoyed a seafaring novel by C.S. Forester or Patrick O'Brien you probably will like this story about an astronaut marooned on Mars.  The isolation and the problem resolutions are told in the same way.  You might worry that the title involves alien beings or something supernatural.  Not so.  The near present-day story is taut and exciting and humorous as well.  It has some profanity and crude sexual references that may not be inappropriate under the circumstances.  I must recommend this book.
1250010403|5.0|Great book !!  I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to read the second.  I will order the 3rd in the trilogy as soon as it is available.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is worth downloading.  I did it, so you should to.  This game is just so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Try it.
B000063147|5.0|He absolutely adores this music. I was so pleased to have found it for him and have it shipped so very fast to him.<br />I even took a listen and fell in love with Avenged Sevenfold.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Excellent!!  I am happily surprised at how closely the series is sticking to the book.  Can't wait to see it come to life!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I absolutely love this app. If I could only have one app, this would be it! I would recommend it to anyone who has a lot on their schedule & needs reminders to keep it straight. I have used it on my Kindle Fire for several years. I love all the customization and options it allows. You can create: repeating entries with multiple reminders (using e-mail, pop ups, & SMS), multiple calendars for different types of events, designating each calendar a different color of text, and add icons to each entry. This is very helpful when you glance at your main calendar & can tell by the color of the text or the icon, you have &#34;that&#34; to do this week. It synchronizes with my Google calendars & tasks on my laptop & my HTC Droid DNA. I just learned that when you purchase it, you can use it across different devices. Getting ready to download it to my phone!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Just don't like it at all.  Now I am trying to find out how to delete this app!  I think I just remembered how to do it.
B0064W639K|5.0|Even if you don't like Batman, you can appreciate The Long Halloween for the complexity of its story. How far will people go to get what they want? Do Gotham's terrorists create Batman or vice versa? What is the toll that crimefighting takes on Batman's, Gordon's, and Harvey Dent's personal lives? Follow this up with The Dark Victory.
B003D513TQ|5.0|Such a beautiful movie!  Good acting, beautiful sets, nice music.<br />Who could ask for more?  The characters are brought out so well,<br />and I think the actors were well-chosen.  Julian Glover is a hoot in<br />his bit part as the Duke of Wellington.  Emily Blunt and Rupert<br />Friend are breathtaking as Victoria and Albert.
B009AMANBA|5.0|What a great movie. Leaves you feeling so patriotic. Great story. Daniel day Lewis and Sally were awesome. Worth the buy all actors were great.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|This app has changed my life. I met my wife using Badoo. Thank you and keep up the great work!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Loved the plot. Loved the actors. Loved the story. Great acting. It's definitely a movie to watch. Or to buy it. Awesome.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|it's no early Muse, but a little better than their last politics infused album. A few of the songs are catchy.
0345803507|4.0|The book was captivating and a quick read.  However, I got upset with the regression of the characters at the end of the book.  I wish it wouldn't have ended that way.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Just a fantastic old school album by the incredibly talented crew of S.O.A.D. Buy it though, don't steal it :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I wondered how they were going to make one book into 3 movies but they did a great job. I read the book 40 years ago and again when the Lord of the Rings Trilogy came out. I really liked the Hobbit movie.  All previous tries were sorely lacking.  Great!
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Another great version Of Mahjong.  Challenging and easy on the eyes. Easy to use on a Smart phone and Tablet.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS ON TOP. THIS GAME IS TOTALLY BETTER THAN WHAT IT SAYS AT THE TOP. TOTALLY BUT IT
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Josh is always good on a lazy Sunday morning enjoying brunch on the Deck. Really good album to add to your collection
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I did not see Lincoln in the theater. Waited until just this weekend due to my crazy life. Lincoln caused me to engage in the political battle of 1864-65 with my mind and slightly with my emotions. Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent. His acting stood &#34;head and shoulders&#34; above his fellow actors in the film. Sally Field was a strong Mary Todd Lincoln, but from what I have read Sally seemed much more sane then Mrs. Lincoln actually was. I was not disappointed with the film, but not blown away either.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although I did not understand the entire experience Dr Alexander described, it was enough for me to give it deep thought.  My opinion is now more positive about the possibility of &#34;heaven&#34; existing and having less fear of departing this life as we know it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written, and hard to put down. I found the plot quite interesting and the main character, Andy Barber, has more than the ordinary mystery issues to deal with as he tries to resolve this whodunit.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howdy writes with stunning and vivid detail.  I couldn't stop reading the omnibus until I finished.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie was beautifully filmed and stuck to what I remember from the book. I am still thinking about which story I believe...
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I'm a fan of FOB and had been looking forward to this album. \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark\\" as a first radio release was an excellent choice... catchy, engaging and the true FOB sound. And the entire album is like that. I found myself ready to sing along after a couple of listens and just wanting to play it over and over again. (Trust me when I say this seldom happens for me; I'm very particular about music.) I love the fact that each song has it's own sound. There are far too many performers these days who have one hit and make the majority of their songs sound the same to capitalize on it. But FOB takes a few mild risks and I think it pays off. The guest performers didn't make much of an impact, but they didn't detract from the songs either. This is definitely a step-up from their other albums, a maturing of their sound. It's fuller, but still fun.
B002GLSX8C|5.0|The more I listen to Zeppelin, the more I see the brilliance of each performer.  However, if one has to shine the brightest, unfortunately he also fell the soonest.  There have been many great drummers - Pert from Rush, Grohl from Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures (with John Paul Jones) to name just two- but in the history of rock and roll and even other genres, there has been few that can play the drums not only as a rhythm instrument, but as an instrument in its own right.  Bonham added so much to this group that it is completely appropriate to that they broke up after his death.  Nothing against Page, Jones or Plant - they are all incredible musicians in their own right - but Bonham is the clear star of this group.  Not just in shear talent but in musicality.  He was able to add to any piece not just with technical brilliance.  He knew exactly what each piece needed to make it perfect.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|There are no words to describe this moving film. It will pull every emotion you never knew you had to the surface. It might just change your life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can t wait till I read the 3rd one<br />The way things are described and what will happen next keeps you reading.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|My girls loved this one.  It was very sweet movie, although there were some scarry parts for the really young ones.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|i find this game very interesting and it holds my interest and i keep playing it over again put mor e games like this on kindle fire
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a terrific series!  Discovered in the two-page spread in a recent Wall Street Journal, it is a wonderful -- and scary -- look into the not-too-distant future.  Highly detailed and peopled with &#34;real&#34; characters, it is certainly worthwhile reading for anyone interested in &#34;what if&#34; fiction.  I am now reading the sequel/prequel, &#34;Shift.&#34;  Leave it to a good ole North Carolina boy to come up with something like this.  Congratulations, Mr. Howey!<br /><br />Coy Carpenter
B009KS4XRO|4.0|i playe dit last night and i kept going back for more . i dont know if im being charge for extra cards for 1.99  and i thought it was a free game iguess it is but if you want for cards do you pay more ?
B004HO6HWK|5.0|Great fun in watching this movie. The storyline for most of Jason's movie is straight forward. It scores well with plenty of action. Never a dull moment and a surprise ending too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so much fun grooming &amp; caring for Beauty. This app is so easy to learn &amp; the prompts are a lot of help &amp; easy to understand. The easiest app I've found so far.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The movie was excellent.  It was a musical and very well done.  Good actors in it. It is definitely a production to keep on your shelf.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever u will die I swear!!!! The first time I played it I was in subway heaven love it
B0055SWM08|4.0|I enjoy this game. Its fun and relaxing. The music is very nice too. Sometimes I get stuck and wish it wasn't so hard at times so I could keep moving forward.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Good read· Fast paced and pulls you in from the first chapter.  Love the documentary style in which it's written.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I chose this rating on account I loved the movie since I first saw it aways back. Some changes were made to it that did not improve the movie and will be noticed  by those of us that remember the original. But it's still George Lucas' triumphant depiction of Teen-age shenanigans on a Summer night. I know! I lived the movie before it was made.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is one of the funniest and touching films; the fact that it is based on a true story and was handled joy, respect and integrity makes it a &#34;must see.&#34;
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Yep, heard about it.  Heard about the books too.  Never thought much about checking them out because most of the time with big cinema stuff like this they get it all wrong.  Nope, not this time.  I was enthralled from the very first episode.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such an interesting story line keeps me wanting to see what is next. Impecable acting by all involved.  I love it!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|i sat down and watched the entire season over 2 days.  Well worth it.  As with season one though, NOT for children without heavy pre-screening supervision
B0063M22QO|4.0|I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE BUT NOW I CANT STOP. TOO MUCH FUN. Very challenging and forwarding at the same time.nO
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|As a history, sci-fi and fantasy enthusiast I was interested in this but thought it would be a hybrid of documentary and drama narration.  Instead, joyfully, it is very much more than this! The story, detail and hint of mystic power play well together and make me yearn for simpler times, but the powerful intrigue and battles of jealously and greed bring it into focus as a very dangerous time much more so than our own.  Highly, highly recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This helps my mind stay in tacked..playing this keeps me focused.. the older we get neet some to keep the mind sharp
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Its off the damn chains! If you got eyes watch this damn movie! Its damn good! I loved this damn movie from start to finish!
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|With two boys who wrestle, I try to find movies as often as I can that show the sport in action. I know that mma isn't wrestling but it uses wrestling and most great mma fighters were wrestlers in school. The plot was decent. The lead up to the big fight was well done. Ill admit that I cried at the end. It was a good pick. Even though my boys couldnt relate to the hardships, they could relate to the characters' brother relationship.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey knows how to make us laugh. I loved reading this, but found some of the narrative about SNL to be a bit tedious.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I like the music, too bad the cd arrived scratched, so a couple of the songs have skips in them. I guess it's not terrible because I was able to auto-rip the cd to my itunes account as well, but now I need to burn another copy of the cd so I can play it in my car without the skips.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love this game!!! Easy game for everyone to enjoy! Hoping you continue. to have more games that are free for us to enjoy!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have used OfficeSuite for more years than I can remember.  Originally  on the Blackberry format.  It is always dependable!
B000L53D4O|5.0|My girlie loves this item which will grow with her and continue to work even when she is at walking age.
1476734941|4.0|Follow the FAST guidelines and stick to the calorie requirements. At first it seems awkward but you will find a schedule that works for you. It takes time for your body to adjust but it will work. It is important to get a food scale as the books also listed in calories.and in grams and milligrams
0439023521|1.0|I have read this before on a loan and bought the 2nd and 3rd book brand new. I wanted to read the first one again then go through the series. I couldn't fine the first book in store so I found it here and have no problem buying used when in good/great condition. I was given a date  to receive. Well....that changed and just about 3 weeks later I'm still waiting at the mailbox. I've already read 2 other books just waiting for this one....if it ever gets here. Never have a problem with Amazon sellers with good star ratings but I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THE SNAIL PACED SELLER AGAIN!
B00186LGXA|1.0|the description when it buys says 2lp and from universal uk but this version is the warner bros i hope is playing good i didn't play jet
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Ok, so everyone's going on and on about how Paramore has changed for the worse and they are more pop and blahblahblah.  Is this true?  Yes and no.  But overall, this CD will have you moving and listening to it over and over.  I've loved Paramore since they first came out, and I have to say that this CD has some of the best songs ever created by them.  Songs like \\"Part II\\", \\"Anklebiters\\", and \\"Proof\\", travel back more to their roots and fans of Paramore will instantly fall in love with them.  Other songs like \\"Ain't it fun\\" don't have the traditional Paramore feel, but its important to recognize that this is still amazing music.  They have evolved and matured as a band, and as such some of their music has evolved as well.  If you buy the CD you will see what I mean.  Don't get me wrong, this CD will never be RIOT!, but it definitely is worth listening to and I would go so far to say that not listening to it would be a slight against yourself.  Happy Listening, Parawhores!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|my son and i enjoyed this movie just seemed a little long at times but it was worth sitting at home watching it
1936891026|5.0|I was just reading some of the poor reviews on this book. I guess not everyone needs the same thing. I kept this book by my bed for years and would start re-reading it every six months or so. Creativity for a living can be a very hard thing. I'm happy to say that this book was always in the back of my mind as I pushed forward. I definitely preferred the first half as the second half was lightweight repetition. I am now actively working in my creative field and doing quite well. I would recommend this book to anyone working in any form of art. Angela
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Had a difficult time getting into this book.  Will look for the movie to see if the story comes together better.  Overall, though, it was a good read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|You need good hand eye coordination for this, reminds me of collapse blast just a little fancier, but over all a good game.
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent, thrilling, realistic, historically-intriguing, somewhat-factual, good, damn read. Thank you Dan Brown for offering a free download of The Da Vinci Code on my kindle. :) xoxo
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded the free version and liked it so much I bought the full version!  It really helps me go to sleep. Even when I have a migraine.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Very good movie, fast pace and kept the action going. My kind of movie. Acting was very well done. Great
034580404X|5.0|I'm not usually a fiction reader. I was consumed, however, by this series! I started the first book on a Friday afternoon of my Memorial Day Weekend last year (my son and I were at a music festival). I was so engrossed in the books that I read books #1 AND #2 AND attended six concerts with my son!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Again, Nicholas Sparks did not disappoint with this one. One of my favorites. Gripping and compellling and what is sure to be a favorite amongst all who reads this book!!!
0812983459|5.0|Read it for a feminist book club and everyone loved it.  There are twists and turns, one in particular you don't see coming.  Every page is rich in prose.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a v g app. Easy to edit so you can receive the news you want. Clear and concise as always from the bbc.<br />I recommend this.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is an all around great movie. My kids, ages, 3, 7 and 12 all enjoyed it.<br /><br />It is a great combination of characters and settings which will appeal to all ages and both boys and girls.<br /><br />My youngest boy, loved the racing scenes (Mario Kart) , my daughter loved the Sugar Rush characters and my oldest enjoyed the Hero Duty (Halo) settings and I enjoyed the entire thing! Its a great blending of characters and scenes to appeal to everyone.<br /><br />I'm 30 and I watched it a second time after the kids where sleeping! The old Nintendo fonts are neat to see for people my age.<br /><br />The movie is great, but just one side note. If you you concerned with guns in movies there are a few scenes where one of the characters has a laser gun that they use to shoot scary looking robot/bugs... so if this is something that concerns you, maybe make sure you sit with your kids while they watch it. My three year old hid his eyes when the robot bugs came, but its a Disney movie, so its not like its packed with violence... Totally worth watching, my kids almost had tears come to their eyes when Ralph dropped from the sky and he realizes he is a good guy after all.<br /><br />Watch it, watch it, watch it!
0345529057|5.0|Martin is a great author, easy to read, simple terminology but great flow at the same time. These books are phenomenal. I would recommend them to everyone. They seem long but you get through them very quickly.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|One of the most best books I have ever read. It has changed my out look on life. Thanks you, Viktor.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|... Rachel Mcadams' magnificent ass scene. But IDK why I watched the whole thing :S. Oh the things I do for my celeb crushes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game I really enjoyed playing this game I made a great choice do u have any more free games
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is a real page turner.  I couldn't figure out what was going on prior to the ending of the book.
B006ZNRD06|3.0|when playing the videos i want it start freezes up and starts slow down and run behind the audio. it lags really really bad  please fix it
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The acting makes this movie. Though it has more Hollywood in it than I would prefer, it is well worth viewing.
B00ALCBTWU|1.0|Mildly entertaining film.  Unfortunately, what true events inspired this isn't in the history books.  Most disappointing is the fact that the accuracy of uniforms, equipment, etc.  Even historical accuracy would've improved the film.  You must feel for Mr. Neal McDonough, who was in the extremely accurate \\"Band of Brothers\\" series, where accuracy and story were paramount!  If you like seeing things blow up and the good guys prevail over the bad guys, you'll watch it until the end.  Otherwise you'll go nuts watching a weak story, historical inaccuracy, and lack of attention to detail
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I can't stop watching The Good Wife.....my favorite series so far. Don't know why no one recommended this to me before.
B001CTGQBK|4.0|Can't beat Grease for '50's nostalgia....  A very young John Travolta and an equally young Olivia Newton-John star in this formula movie about 1957 high school - the songs are a lot of fun, and the young Travolta has all the moves.  As they advertised in Mexico in '82: &#34;Vasileno con Juan Travolta - Sabrosa!&#34;
B000YJ54DU|5.0|as usual lee child did not disappoint, filled with much action and lots of suspense.  loved it and am awaiting the 13th!
B000HKYA1I|5.0|It was a strange movie at first, but It went from strange to heart breaking to heart warming.  Sometimes we need closure.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great read, engaging, and compelling. A broad orchestra of characters, changing the pitch and mood of the story every 10 pages or so. I love maps and wish the maps were maybe just a tad more ornate and detailed, but they're definitely useful, and this is not enough to dock a star. Read it, love it.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Didn't know why it was so popular! Now I know, it was very entertaining!  Wish there was a part III
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I would give 5 stars but for the fact that two of the episodes do not play correctly.  Mirror Mirror skips badly in the last few minutes.  The Mark of Gideon will not play at all.  The other 77 episodes and extra material is all of top video and audio quality.  At about $100, this is a bargain for anyone who wants to watch the original Star-Trek shows again.  Some of the scenes (e.g. shuttlecraft, the Enterprise, alien craft on main viewing screen, special effects, et-cetera) have been computer recreated and/or enhanced.  I might have preferred the original video material, but the graphics in the enhanced scenes have been done to excellence.  Even with the video glitches in a couple of the episodes, I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  It was a great value for the purchase price.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very thought provoking while entertaining.<br />I found it difficult to put down. Also a good review of history.<br />Highly recommend it.
0307592731|5.0|I have hiked the PCT with my husband, and so, make it my aim to read most of the stories written about it.  This one did not disappoint.  I loved reading from Cheryl's point of view and could easily picture in my mind's eye, the locations she recounted.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|I loved this movie the very first time I saw it all those years ago. I identified very much with the lead character (still do)<br />who just doesn't adjust at all with the major changes to his way of life. It has been my sad experience to watch this very thing happen in real life to me an so many others that I know. I haven't seen the remake with Tom Selleck because for me Lee Marvin will always be Monte Walsh. Maybe I just don't WANT to change.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This is an excellent family film.  It explores life and death in appropriate settings as well as where our meat comes from.  It also shows that when one puts their mind to something , anything is possible!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Pi, despite being essentially uninteresting, is at least filmed in an interesting way. End of compliments.<br /><br />This film is a look into the mania and paranoia of an addled, drug-addicted mind.  You'll get the nihilistic point of this film about 10 minutes in, but unfortunately there's still 75 minutes to go. Speaking of going, go ahead and move on to watching something that won't make you feel awful. Treat Aronofsky films like you would treat a dog turd left on the sidewalk in front of your home; it's a smelly disaster where someone had to be actively engaged in thoughtlessness to leave it rotting in the sun, solely for the purpose of offending you.<br /><br />This movie is an assault on the eyes and ears.  Shaky-cam, lo-fi video recording quality, snap cuts and screeching, tinnitus-inducing background sfx indicate the point of this film: to make the viewer queasy, unsettled and unhappy. To that extent, Pi is a massive success. Aronofsky subtracts from the sum total of human happiness with this project, and does so in a cruel and manipulative way. I am a worse person for having watched this, and that is the only unforgivable crime a director can commit.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is addicting our 3 yo grand daughter showed us the game and we have all enjoyed playing it, on the Android phones and the Kindle Fire..
1616550414|5.0|I grew up with The Legend of Zelda surrounding my childhood. To see the artwork and gameplay notes and story notes all in one huge, well put-together volume brought literal tears to my eyes. Always happy to report good work!
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|I guess every now and then you just have to try something new...I am thinking he enjoyed putting this together. Not my favorite...but it  is starting to grow on me.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love the series and the price was amazing new and cheap what more could you ask for in a product
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a very gifted writer.  I couldn't put this book down and couldn't wait to read the next one.
B001152TL6|5.0|Great work from this director, a great cast, great performances for a great story. Exciting and unique in its genre.
0452273331|4.0|I was really impressed with Ayn Rand's writing in this novel; the way it made everything seem simple and straight forward, but was really attending to deeper motives and musings regarding society.<br /><br />It almost has a book within the book with it's multitude of protagonists and antagonists, all struggling to be real in a world ruled by the superficial. Each character has been expertly crafted with realistic flaws and bad decision making skills. I feel as if every time I started to get close to a character, a giant looming flaw was presented to squash any good feelings I had toward them. Noone is safe from Rand's scrutiny of the human condition and what drives us.<br /><br />That being said, I think her agenda behind the book really holds up even today. People are still sacrificing their souls for a higher place in societal circles; trying to overshadow their ignorance with opinions. In a world where darkness is overwhelming, it is nice to see even a flawed character, such as Roark, stay true to who they are on the most basic & complex of levels.<br /><br />The Fountainhead and other novels reviewed on my blog: [...]
B00BMEF6IO|4.0|The best I heard of this genre in years. The voice reminds me a little to Linking Park in some parts, but it is certainly a great album and it shows the very good work done by the producer Terry Date.
B005SAP45I|1.0|I'm glad it was free on Prime. How could Pixar make such a lousy movie. We were looking forward to watching it and I was looking forward to Christmas being easy with Cars 2 toys. Not so. There is no way we are buying the DVD or any of the toys.  Move along, nothing to see or watch here.
B000UBMSB8|1.0|A shame, is the first time that I get something so poor and in such bad condition from Amazon. The product was sealed, but once I opened it, I noticed that the box set was incomplete, the disc number 4 does not come with it and the box was broken into several parts.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|product was shipped as expected and in great condition.  The ordering of this item was easy.  I would recommend this to my friends.  This is a grat series to watch
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|One of the best works of Trent Reznor to date. That classic NIN sound along with that beautiful female vocals and the arrangements just sound incredible.
0525478817|1.0|I was very disappointed about this book after the reviews it got. It was written for a teenager audience. It is written very sappy and melodramatically. The plot is boring and the book dragged on. I had to force myself to finish it. I would not recommend this book to anyone I know.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Sound Garden is back, that sound we all know but with a modern sonic force that expands when you press play on your stereo. Cornell definitely has one of the best voices in the business.
B00005R2IS|3.0|Great movie.its a classic not a collector movie but good to spend an evening, with a beer and some cracks
0345803485|2.0|only got to page 120..........seems to unrealistic and predictable. I don`t mind the graphic sexual details but it just did not seem like a quality read altogether. I can`t imagine why somebody would want to get a second and third book............
1416914285|5.0|I really recommend this book to anyone. I kind of got annoyed by the way the book ended, but i loved the ending!! It begs you to buy the next one and continue reading the series!!! A very good choice for readers who like this type of genre. I already order the two other books that continue the series, i hope they are as good if not better than this one. Love it!!
0061120073|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book about the life in NY in the earlier days. It is an easy flowing book like a little stream in the woods not to exciting but pleasant.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|Most people will find the advice given in this book very obvious. Perhaps for someone extremely shy or socially awkward there may be some usefully tips.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This was the final episode to the previous books.  It was pretty good but predictable in a lot of its plot lines. Caution:  Spoilers ahead,..... Of course, Bella's child would become the soulmate to her now best friend.  Of course, Bella would survive the coming birth and transformation.  Of course, the baby would not be unique and of course, love would triumph over all in the end.  I would still like an epilogue to this about what happened after the battle and everyone settled down.  But still a good read for me.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|Atari did an OK job of reproducing everything but it isn't really optimized for a small touch screen. Try it out. The navigation - having to touch the screen then back down to the ABC abm buttons is tricky.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|If you want to organize all you media, play it remotely, save web video content, download music and video metadata and not fiddle a bunch you will like this.  I use plex on my HTPC for media management.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|This app helped my 2 year old son recognize his numbers and learn to count all while enjoying the beautiful pictures, soothing music, and friendly voice.  The range of difficulty levels also allowed me to use this app with my 4 year old daughter to reinforce counting concepts and basic math skills.  Highly recommended!
B0032KLAKE|1.0|I started to watch Primal Fear last night. I really wanted to see it; it's Edward Norton's first movie (at age 19), and I love Laura Linney. I baled after about 30 minutes because of Gere. I can't stand him, as he struts around every scene as if he's looking in a mirror and telling himself how pretty he is. He does this all the time, e.g., American Gigolo, Pretty Woman, An Officer and a Gentleman, etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ton of fun love playing it my daughter also loves it great game must try help pass time on while waiting
0307476073|4.0|I just finished this book, and I must admit, I was not drawn in to Strayed's book when I first tried to read it. The voice seemed \\"typical\\" of what I expected - and when I heard about the book when it first came out, I really went to that place of \\"I've read so many similar books about similar journeys.\\" I think when you are of a certain vintage, some things \\"ring\\" familiar just because you've lived a while. I think I read part of the first chapter, decided I knew what the book was going to be about, and put it down.<br /><br />After I returned it to the library, I was drawn to her book of \\"Dear Sugar\\" columns because of an assignment I was trying to figure out for students. I bought the book, reading through it for any examples that might appeal to the students I teach. While I was reading, I was very impressed with Strayed's voice and how she answered questions that people asked of her. In fact, her voice resonated with me, making me really think about writing, voice, honesty, meaningfulness, and what really matters. After reading TINY BEAUTIFUL THINGS, I decided to give WILD another chance.<br /><br />What I loved the most about WILD was that I felt like I was with Strayed on the PC trail. Every time I picked up the book, I was happy to be back on the trail again, wondering what was going to come up this time. I felt like she created a world that I, as a reader, could completely lose myself in, and I loved that feeling. I did skim through some parts and thought another edit would have made it tighter for me (and I wished for more description along the trail, but as others have said, \\"it's not about the PCT\\"), but I did enjoy reading it very much.<br /><br />At the end, I liked what Strayed said about trying to get out but realizing that all that time, she was really trying to get in. That is, accepting herself and her life and finally being able to move forward. It's one of those things that sounds so simple, but for each of us, it is different - and not always easy to recognize. I think the kindness of strangers helped her a lot along the way, but I also think that hiking the trail helped her trust, believe, and see herself as a worthy and good person.<br /><br />In WILD, Strayed's voice rang honest, real, and true. For better or for worse. As she said on the last page in the book, \\"It was my life - like all lives, mysterious and irrevocable and sacred.\\"
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Fantastic book, starts a bit slow, but then the pace quickens and you really fall in love with the characters
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|The trailer did not show the rude and crude nature of this movie.  It had way too much sexual content way too many four letter words.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Great cast, acting and story.  Make you think about life, the bigger plan for us and where are roles fall within that plan.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|lots of action, but the plot was hard to figure out.  It did keep our attention, but we were often kind of puzzled as to what was happening and why.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|If you love historical romances like I do- this is perfect. Great Production, Costumes, Acting-  I would not change a thing!!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|It's a good, honest depiction of how we got to the point of killing OBL. I can see why the main stream media and Hollywood elites hate the movie. It destroys their fantasy world view.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Well done. Frustrated they broke it up into 3 films though. I'm excited to watch the others. Beautiful cinematography. Well casted.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I stopped watching it after 30 min wasted my money , did not feel this movie, everything else like costumes was wonderful  just don't like type of movies edited and directed like that
B00BF11STU|1.0|Takes a good true life story and screws it up.  Torture and slow for the audience and the characters in the film.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|was not bad at all , I was thinking worse , but I watch to the end with interest , I like Denzel Washington and how he performed in this movie , did not like the movie character , really creepy scenario .. HOWEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE , it was just right
B00BESNKB8|4.0|I would recommend watching this movie. Great action scenes and great story line. Not once was I bored watching this film.
B00000DI06|5.0|It's what I expected, great choral and orchestral music, with bold sounds and quiet sounds. Woship inducing and calming as it focuses me on God.
B004G6009U|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has its usually fairy tale story and has some adult humor as well
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super cool!! It's a fun and resourceful puzzle game that can distract your mind from what ever your thinking on!! A good game for when you can't sleep!! I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be entertained!!
B00BESCJII|5.0|Such a wonderful movie. Would watch it again and again. Loved the cast and their rolls they played. Must see!!!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|the only reason i wanted to watch it cause of lord of the rings series. but honestly it was very long and first half of the movie was very boring...
B00AYB20KI|5.0|Loved the movie and the cinematography. Movie was suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat. And had a great twist to the movie. And the casting couldn't of been better
B006YC74E8|1.0|I can't get none off amazon app for games on my coby just my books so I had to cut them off . And remove them comeplet off of my coby. So i can get the app i want on he play store so i just go their. Or i just give it to my son for a few mins and a list what i want and he puts it on their if he is on bizz for mom that is thank you.
B008458O3S|5.0|Plenty of challenge here. This game is alot of fun if you like solving puzzles. I own this for both my iPad and my Android phone.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Based on the trailer, this looked like a scary movie, but it's not bad.  I'd say a child 12-13 could watch it.  Younger than that and it might be too much.  It might freak my nine-year old out.  I felt at the edge of my seat a few times, which was great, but the ending could have been a bit better.  I can't say much more than that or I'd give it away.  ;-)<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth watching.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I have always wanted to get out of the \\"rat race\\" and have been trying to come up with ways to make my money work for me instead of working for my money. There were concepts that I never heard of. I'm so glad I bought this book.
B008220D7S|1.0|if you like to hear ear numbing cursing by adults and children get this movie...we hated it enough to stop watching after 5 minutes ( which was 4  minutes too long ) ...sophmoric...unfunny...terrible acting...it's in my garbage can right now...a prime example why we seldom go \\"to the movies\\" anymore
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've read a lot of books, and this is my favorite hands down. it has a ton of action, some jokes, courage, and most of all, it greatly depicts the bravery of Lutrell and the soldiers that lost their lives in operation Redwing
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I love this band, they're style is great! I haven't quite realized how to download from the cloud and put it on my iPhone, but I'm sure there's a way. Virtual albums are the new thing I guess.<br /><br />Recommended 100%.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I had to watch it eventually because of all of the hype and was disappointed.  Just not that entertaining of movie.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|i thought it was both funny and exiting,lots of strange situations in the movie and different directions taken by the charachters
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Great fantasy book. Drama, magic, dragons, and gods. Reminded me of books like the series a song of ice and fire.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies of all time. It's also one of the best sequels in any movie category.<br /><br />The special effects hold up fairly well, even by today's standards. The atmosphere the movie conveys is compelling and believable.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it already, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This has become my favorite Christmas album.  I still enjoy the other classics by other artists, but this album's quality singing along with classic songs is precisely what I want for such a product.
088103052X|5.0|The first time I read this, I was in the eighth grade. This reading set the tone for my beliefs for the rest of my life. Being a Marine brat, daughter of a career Marine, I was raised and lived with all races, creeds and colors and simply knew no<br />prejudice against others. The closest I had ever come to knowing bias was the Navy and Marine Kids against the Army and AirForce Kids at different sporting events/schools. =)<br /><br />Needless to say, this widened my perspectives and views. I couldn't believe one people could or would treat others in this manner. This book afforded many oppening conversations and talks regarding prejudices and fears of the unknown, and personal acceptance of responsibilities and growth.<br /><br />The book to me was well written annd such a necessary tale to be told...we were moving into the mid/later part of the 20th century. It should be required reading in every school...starting as early as possible. Though most prejudice is not as open as it was, we as a people have a long way to go.<br /><br />Please, if you haven't read it, do and then pass it along to another. You may dislike the violence and the attitudes, but perhaps something more can be learned.
0345803485|5.0|This is a good read I highly recommend it. It is a very different romance novel which i normally do not like but this trilogy is worth the read.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not exactly sure if I agree with some of the casting in this movie. It stayed fairly close to the book. Looking forward to the next installment.
B00969PR18|1.0|Very difficult to use. I couldn't figure it out in under 30 min. so I removed it from my Kindle.
B008Y73940|4.0|The story takes some unexpected twists and turns and never dulls.  It is not drawn out.  I highly recommend this movie.
B008602KQI|2.0|graphics and visuals were great and it started out as a great story, but it went downhill soon after. Was not sure why they introduced those creatures to try and kill the lead character. Skipping to the end- they ride back on the train and wave from the window - that's it? Well I'm sure someone made a lot of money on this movies. The best part was the title of the movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The ending was horrible...after all that it was a big let down...took forever to engage you then one you are hooked it just ends with so much resentment...
1451695195|5.0|Some of my patients have been able to see and describe an afterlife, before they go. I have no religion. I know that some (not all) physicians opine that patients are hallucinating as the neurotransmissions begin to break done. If that's what it is, at LEAST it's an awfully pleasant way to go out. But, I have come to believe that my patient's are experiencing another, and better reality. I haven't read the book yet. Will report again after I've finished it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|If you like anything, you should probably like this. Some things you might like would be: Hulk saving Ironman like WHOA! and Bruce Banner saying &#34;I'm always angry&#34; as well as Scarlett Johannsen looking way too hot, and Captain America taking command.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It took forever for this new album, but the wait was worth it! Justin Timberlake has truly out done himself with this album. I love every song, the man's great.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Game of Thrones is the best show I've seen in a long time and Khaleesi is more badass than ever.
B008Y720JU|5.0|This film had a lot to do with &#34;faith&#34;, not always how we think it will present itself. I loved this movie
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|I think this is a great Disney film, and with such a great plot. The leads have a lot of chemistry and Disney did a great job.
B0058SNI9O|5.0|She loves these, they fit her like a glove, they are comfortable and have good grip for walking outdoors.  Can't be happier!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|My husband read the book before we watched the movie, but I didn't know any background. The movie was pretty entertaining, but the storyline and character development was a little lacking. I went through the first third of the movie not knowing the relation between 2 people. Its a neat story, nonetheless.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Exceeds my expectations.  I will never be somewhere without a good book to read.  Thank you!  It is the best app I have downloaded.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Such a cute movie.  Harralson Ford does a great job at his character.  Would recommend to those a fan of Rachel McAdams.  She's adorable in this movie!
B009CF7GRY|5.0|I love this movie. I think it's a lot better than the original but I'm young so I might be biased. It's free with Prime so there's no reason not to watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It very fun it keep me very occupied I love this game it help with the brain it like a brain strangely I want to thank the person who made it thank u who ever made this gsme
0375851569|5.0|grandson's first birthday party theme was cat in the hat.  Used the books in part as decorations in front of the food items and read to kids in attendance
B003F3FJQO|5.0|A really great book. It kept me on my toes the entire time. The suspense nearly killed me and the excitement was non-stop. Another great book by James dashner. I can't wait to read the third book!!!

B005ETA5K2|2.0|less that its predecessor, that 2W are bull s***, I'm really disappointed, you should change this product for any other
B003102JDM|5.0|This was so serious about a guy who's life is falling apart or changing in ways he never thought, but everyone's life does that.  It is good to see his perspective.  I liked this movie enough to search out more Stuhlbarg brothers movies.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a compelling read for anyone who'd like to wrestle with the moral and ethical considerations of modern science.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Great game, keeps the mind thinking.  It helps you kill time while waiting in the airport or on a lunchbreak.  I like it.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My son adores this movie has already watched it 3-4 times in a couple weeks, he especially loves the laughy taffy part
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Having fun playing this Angry Birds while I recoup from surgery.  Helps pass the time, takes my mind off my pain.  Enjoying this one.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Some people will go to extreme lengths just to make a point.  She picked an interesting way to do it!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Does exactly what it says it should do.  Had no glitches.  My only even sorta gripe was it took a while to search.  That's not a problem, just my impatient self.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|To begin this mouse hits dead on for what a gaming mouse should feel and functions it should have.<br />It is very comfortable to hold over long periods. Very good sensitivity adjustment.<br />Software/drivers are not too good, but not impossible to use either.<br />This mouse delivers performance, feel and looks at such a great price, you really don't need to look elsewhere. unless you are more worried on having &#34;brand&#34; gear for double or triple the money.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|This movie was such a disappointment.  Fell asleep halfway though, just didn't capture my attention.  The premise of the movie is great and the costumes were wonderful, but the content was lacking.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink's charisma and personality comes through loud and clear and sweet in this collection, from the outrageous to the soft.  I am thrilled with my purchase :)
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like the Twitter app.  It's pretty user friendly and the feed is easy to read.  Just what you need to get a quick update and scroll through tweets.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This is NOT a tycoon type builder, it's not a &quot;game,&quot; and it's NOT a strategy game. So what exactly is it? It's a typical &quot;pay to advance levels&quot; Farmville piece of crap we are all used to. There's no shame in wanting to make money, but you are nearly stuck on levels 1 - 9 if you are not willing to buy the &quot;Mega Pack of Bucks&quot; for $99.00. $99.00 to PLAY A GAME YOU HAVE TO KEEP PAYING FOR AFTER THE INITIAL $99.00? Just sell the game and stop with trying to charge more and more money for each level !!!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|This movie was a bit boring. I would recommend that most people pass on this movie. It was not inspirational, emotional, or filled with action.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I'm almost done with the second book. I was trying to give this more of a shot. Sincerely hoping that the first in the series was a 'new' writer. Unfortunately, it's still the same way. This is written on about a third grade level, at best. The story is underdeveloped. The characters are underdeveloped. Don't even get me started on the main character and why the author named him Thor. I feel like I'm just plugging away story time for a small child.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I just got the sense that Daniel Day-Lewis was so full of himself playing this role. It was OK but not great.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I initially chose this book because of the setting,but soon became enthralled with the characters and story.  I also enjoyed the written accents.  It was a big eye opener at the end of the book that even though it's,s a work of fiction, this kind of thing went on and with full knowledge and acceptance of the Catholic church.
B00BF11STU|2.0|This movie got so much praise that I had to watch it. It is sorta like a documentary but not made as well.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|One of the best films ever made, although it's an incredibly tragic story, love & laughter break out occasionally. Great performances by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, not to mention newcomer Sam Barks.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This movie is almost unwatchable. It is the worst and has nothing redeeming about it. If you liked Lord of the Rings you will hate this.
1932100660|5.0|This book has changed my viewpoint on nutrition.  I won't say I am vegan but am certainly headed in that direction.  This is a &#34;must read&#34; for optimal health.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This movie is really lame. There is no real character development so you don't really care about the couple. Move on.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I'm a fan of the show, so I just had to try it. At first it's kind boring, but it gets more fun at the end!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It was excellent. 3d played like at the movies on my LG TV. Can't wait for the me next in the series.
0385360185|4.0|I gave this to a friend who is legally blind.  It was a great opportunity for my friend to get in on all the hype dispite being unable to actually read the books.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Just like all the other &quot;cut the ropes&quot;, it's just plain fun! Simple levels, complex levels and everything in between
B003NFM3JK|5.0|My students really enjoyed this remake of a great story.  The animation is engaging for middle school students, and one student actually recommended that I purchase this version.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Its ok but it could be better like the speed of egg incubation should be faster and we should git more gold
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is hands down maybe the best series that has ever happened.  It is educational in terms of the time period, I have discovered my favorite tv couple ever, and I hope it stays with a good story line for many more seasons...
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's got a lot of information. It just took me a bit to figure out where all the information I need is located. But I like it now.
0553801473|5.0|Quite a writer, vivid characters, lots of war, lots of killing... character development excellent, never boring .. made into HBO series
B003XE1DN8|5.0|Bought this for my mom, she loves it and doesn't take it off when shes around the house. fits perfectly, and is very comfy, she's planning on getting an new one.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Well wortth the couple of bucks to rent. Great cast, excellent stunts and creativity, definitely would watch again. would recommend.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This is the most amazing album anyone could ever own. Lauryn is so real and pure, there's so much to love about her. The CD Is in absolutely great condition and it's totally worth buying. If you love Lauryn, The Fugees, even GREAT music in general, this is something you need to own.
B00BF11STU|3.0|There could have been a lot of parts filled in so the public would have a better understanding of what was going on in certain parts of the movie.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|this is what rap should be. socially conscious and fun, macklemore and ryan lewis really put together a great record. If you've only heard thrift shop, check out the rest. Very good stuff.
B004QSQMKE|4.0|I used to watch this movie as a kid and it is a good fantasy type movie. This was obviously a very early role for Tom Cruise, but even then you could tell he would be a movie star. The scenery is pretty well done, but the special effects aren't great. For some reason the music seems different than other versions or maybe the one you see on cable. I figured the directors cut would be the way to go, but maybe it is different compared to the original. The price was right for this because sometimes hard to find movies can be pretty expensive. The DVD quality is perfectly fine for this type of movie, no blu ray necessary. This is a good fantasy movie for anyone who likes that type of movie or anyone who likes Tom Cruise.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son loves minecraft. I have ordered this for his birthday. I would definately order again. We love amazon. Great place to order gifts
B004LWZW24|5.0|My wife and I saw this in theaters when it first came out, definitely made for a better experience. The scares weren't cheap, they were well planned and the overall mood of the movie was good. The pace really made for an uneasy feeling and really built tension towards the end. The characters weren't cheesy and the acting was fairly good. Definitely thought the whole idea was different than your typical haunted house type movie, which we liked. We knew we would probably add this to our horror movie collection so we recommend it since it is very re-watchable. The sounds were very well done and the scary characters were very unique. The DVD quality was perfectly fine for this type of movie, blu ray was not necessary. The price was good, Amazon definitely had the best price and the free shipping over $25 is just a great option to have. We really liked the special features as well. The directors and actors really explained a lot of how the movie was made and created. Very interesting to see how funny everyone is on set for such a scary movie. Overall just a solid scary movie and easily can be watched over and over.
B008MM9630|4.0|similar to other farming games  but there is a big difference: you don't have to rely on your friends to advance in game play :)
B003Q6D25K|5.0|A must see in the theaters if you are a fan of this franchise. Unless you have good surround sound the scares won't be as good at home, but turned up loud can give a nice scare. I liked how they tied in the first movie with this one to give us more background on everything. My wife always comments that they seem to always shoot inside really nice homes. Definitely gives you that false sense of security and everything being fine. The scares were definitely good in this one and some parts I feel were really freaky giving you some goosebumps. Usually most sequels will go way over the top and this one stayed true to what made the first one successful. Blu ray wasn't necessary for this movie, DVD quality was perfectly fine. Can't say there were any special features worth mentioning. Definitely a recommended purchase for horror movie fans and fans of this particular franchise considering it is re-watchable even if you know when the scares are coming.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a well written, mature, detailed story with a heavy dose of adventure.  The evolution of an unwanted young boy into a skilled, compassionate warrior was magnificently done.  I keep checking for the next volume -- as soon as I see it is available, I will be buying it!
0439023521|5.0|Two human drives: the love of war and obsession with youth are put together with explosive effect in the Hunger Games. As a fantasy writer ([[ASIN:B008REDRGK IRINA THE WOLF QUEEN (THE RAGNOR TRILOGY)]]) I am awed by the novel's metaphoric power. Katniss's world  -- the `haves' of the Capitol and the `have nots' of District Twelve could be read as a picture for our own First and Third Worlds. The novel speaks to so many aspects of our modern situation: trashing genuine emotion by turning it into kitschy sentiment; the grotesque differences in rich and poor;  surgical enhancements and being `styled,' and an appetite for brutal entertainment that arguably equals the Romans. Katniss is an interesting, prickly heroine who despises fakery but is forced to enter into it for the sake of a loved one. Read it - there's substance here beyond the hype.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book does a credible job of laying things out for the uneducated. Although at times it was way over my head, it served to spark more curiosity and the quest to learn more about our universe and how the pieces all fit together. It also confirmed a lot of my thoughts about how people come to believe in God, and solidified why I do not.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another great read in the Jack teacher series. I've already recommended it to several friends. I am on to the next one in the series.
B008476HBM|1.0|This was inane - I didn't get past the third chapter. Not a book for me. Hope some-one else likes it.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|I have found it helpful in organizing and getting my house in order.  The concept appeals to me.  I want very much to have a home that is company ready all the time.  I am looking forward to making my home into the haven I crave.

B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter... and this app works amazing i have no problems with it at all. LOVE IT Perfect app
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|I can see how some might find this app a riot to play. I am not one of them. Great graphics and smooth motion... the only thing this game was not good at was holding the interest of an old guy... a few years back I would have played this for hours.
B002MC9H8K|5.0|I still love this book, though I read it many years ago and reread it for a book club meeting that I couldn't attend. As the first child of a second generation generation immigrant family, I appreciated the struggles of growing up poor and filled with dreams of having the kind of life the \\"movies\\" offered up. Francie is a character to live along with through a beautifully written novel that has held up through the years.You can't kill a great tree that fights to live!
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game has solved the problem of controls on a touchscreen which previous versions of this type of game have failed to do. I had fun playing it when I got it and still enjoy a round or two for relaxation.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best bible app out there. Has many translations and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone. Good day
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I play this with my grandson and he loves it. It is easy enough for a 2 year old to understand and requires me (the adult) to pay attention in order to lend a hand every so often to keep the game moving smoothly for those moments when a young finger just can not quite get the task done.

0345803485|4.0|WOW.  This book is so intense, dark, romantic, chilling all combined into one. I had a problem with the basic message this book sends out - that you can \\"change\\" your significant other. girl meets billionaire boy, all into his kinky (for lack of better words) \\"double\\" lifestyle.  Sure, it's a nice concept to think that beautiful girl could change mega rich boy, but you should love your partner as they are - despite their flaws. In the second book she starts second guessing herself - but I will save that review for later. now on to a more extensive review.<br /><br />Intense love scenes and you can feel the attraction between Christian and Ana.  The author came up with the character of Christian Grey - a billionaire, young, drop-dead gorgeous, trained pilot - all at the old age of 27!  Ana is a young college senior - about to graduate - working on job interviews and living the modest life a normal college senior.  They meet because her roommate works for the paper and became sick and her roommate convinces Ana to interview Christian. There's instant attraction between the two - which is a bit odd considering Ana is a college senior and he's an unbelievably wealthy, successful businessman.  The night she loses her virginity to him was \\"normal\\" sex - as he put it \\"vanilla sex\\" (could he sound any more arrogant).  I found this extremely unrelatable/unrealistic.  I think this sets up for disappointment with girls reading it who are celibate - yes your first time should be special- but orgasming TWICE?  She didn't even know her own body(when he asks her to pleasure herself she had no idea what to do).  I was disturbed that he kept count how many orgasms she had since they'd been together.  he counted 16 and claimed they all belonged to HIM.  Ok you arrogant SOB.  I dislike him more and more as the book goes on.  Then you get to the very dark side of Christian Grey - the controlling, narcissistic, freaky Christian - which is a massive turn-off.<br /><br /> I thought Ana was very much a 'doormat' through most of the book - until the end.  Christian Grey is definitely, as the title says 50 Shades of Grey.  One minute he's romantic, the next kinky, then a businessman.  Ana has trouble keeping up with his many personalities.  It bothered me how controlling he was - even outside the bedroom.  He made demands with Ana - and she just did what she was told - terrified if she didn't she would lose him - she fell for him quickly.  I really hated that he claimed she was \\"his\\" and demanded she say \\"Sir\\" to him.  The stalking REALLY bothered me.  This is the one element of the book that I founnd concerning.  He showed up at the bar where she was because he traced her number.  He showed up when she went home to visit her mother.  He upgraded her flight to first class - just constantly knew everything about her. He even gave her a Blackberry so she was constantly intouch with him and could email him when he wanted.  The \\"punishment\\" part bothered me too. For example if she rolled her eyes at him - he would punish her by spanking - if she refused spanking then he would have sex with her - refusing to let her orgasm.  This is just awful and selfish.  Deep down Christian has deep mental issues from traumatic childhood events - you slowly begin to find out why he is the way he is. Somehow he convinced her that physical pain during sex is part of the senses - and he really hurt her a few times.  Yet - she still claimed the sex was amazing.  I find this element very disturbing.  After, he would send her expensive gifts and sweet emails.  This is almost reinforcing the element of a textbook abusive relationship.  Boy hits (spanks very hard) girl, she's in pain and cries, then he is all sweet and apologetic.<br /><br /> In the end - I summed up Christian is a huge controlling jerk.  He manages to convince a sexually inexperienced, younger girl to be apart of his world of BDSM.  He always told her the fear was \\"psychological\\".  I also didn't like the message this book could send to young girls - \\"you can only feel sexy with a man\\".  Ana admits she has ever felt sexier when she's dancing with Christian.  Ana seems to have no self worth and can only be happy/confident if Christian is in her life. I just hope girls who are reading this have had positive relationship experiences - and know that letting the male have complete dominance and control over you is not equal and is in no way a healthy relationship. Christian uses money and sex as a power tool over Ana. I find it sad she was constantly worrying about him being mad and what mood he would be in when she sees him.  I get men are moody at times - but he was so Jekyll and Hyde I don't understand why she didn't run screaming in the other direction far away from him. She should have ended up with Jose.  Uncomplicated, \\"normal\\" and good to her.  She even references it several times - why she can't love someone like him.  Well, she could if she opened her mind up to it - but she's masochist and she knows it.  I pity women like her who don't have a backbone and who can't stand up for themselves. I could never be with a man as controlling as he was. I could never be the submissive and have someone claim the dominant over me.  The \\"sex contract\\" was ridiculous. I should have taken a shot of vodka everytime I read the words flushed, delicious, handsome for a fun drinking game - a tad repetitive.  The chapter where she had sex while on her period could have been left out and was frankly disgusting. I read this book in 3 days and couldn't put it down. I'm officially on the 50 Shades bandwagon.  Can't wait to read the other 2 books.
B007N85POS|5.0|OK I admit it I like this game... I play to get 3 stars on and get all prizes and challenges on every level... I am hard core and love it... I play all the Angry Bird games and enjoy them all... the physics are good and only do I occasionally get frustrated... but even then it is in good fun.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I've really enjoyed playing this game!  It's quite entertaining and there's so much to do.  The only downside I've come across is trying to purchase gems...it's impossible to buy them.  It gives you the option for buying but when I try to it doesn't let me :(  still fun to play though!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I first started playing with electronic timers back in... well in the old days we had to build them ourselves...this is the first time I have a timer that I can use easily and works the way my brain works when processing things like lap times... why has it taken this long for a timing device to be this easy to use?
B00CBRH4YU|3.0|In this film the Director was much more interested in moments and pictures than in any kind of real story. The hint of plot or story is present but never any effort to flesh it out with any of the 4 characters. Ben Affleck who is a favorite of mine and has been unfairly judged over the years is wasted in this film. He is a very talented Film maker, a very talented actor and in this his part is whittled away until there are only disjointed moments left of a man with commitment issues and no explanation why. Both female leads are represented as desperately in love but the main character seems to be one moment outragously giddy and happy and the next desperately sad, Bi-Polar you ask as you watch?? The other woman just sad and searching and then just gone from the film. The Priest is the most comfusing character. Caught in a calling he does not feel and eaten up with guilt and remorse as he struggles through each day. This film was an exercise in indulgence by the director to please himself with no thought to telling a story or engaging an audience! I read that this film is taken from the Directors life. If that is true then he has had a sad and unfulfilling life. This was a sad and unfulfilling film and that is a shame because it could have had two very good stories! Do yourselves a favor and watch 'Argo', an excellent film or 'Changing lanes', 'The Company Men', State of Play' or just for fun 'Extract', 4 other Ben Affleck films available on Amazon. All of these will give you an enjoyable movie experience! Any of the Ben Affleck films available will give you a much better movie experience!!
B007N9FKCY|4.0|How fun... easy to play... a little challenging... no brain strain... and a story to go with it all...  so it keeps one entertained for hours...

1579129129|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  If you think because the subject matter is skulls that this book will be creepy or macabre, you will be pleasantly proven wrong.  In this book I was able to see the beautiful and rare in a format like I have never seen.  Here you will see the skull of a dodo, walrus, wolffish, bandicoot, sea lion, two headed cow, capybara, chameleon, and vampire bat just to name a very few.  All with scientific descriptions and classifications, and in some cases a few notes.  The fish and reptile skulls are particularly fascinating to me.  I have never seen anything like them, full of structures that have to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />I bought this book because I like to draw and paint animals and decided it is time to learn more about animal anatomy and the unseen structure of the skull as the foundation to build upon.  This book will be a valuable resource to any artist looking to do the same.  You will not be disappointed, the layout and detailed photography of this book are amazing.

1439102813|5.0|Highly recommend reading this book! So thoughtfully executed as seen through Alice's eyes. This is the book I'm passing out on World Book Night 2013 - to encourage non/seldom-readers to know what we, as readers, know. Books are wonderful!

B003DT194G|5.0|I have been a fan of westerns all my life and out of the hundreds of cowboy movies I have seen, this one is probably at the top of my list.  The scenes and characters in this film are outstanding.  Charles Bronson plays the mysterious harmonica playing fast gun and Henry Fonda plays the ruthless psychopathic killer. Jason Robard also gives a fantastic performance as a bad guy with a heart.  The opening scene in this movie really gives you the feeling of being in a small, hot, and dusty western railroad station.  Three ugly and mean looking killers are waiting for the train to come in and it is clear they have murder on their mind, and that is all I will tell you.<br /><br />This film is expert western movie making at its best.  It has drama, great acting, clever dialog, shoot outs, murder and even a little sex.  In other words, this movie has everything you would ever want in an adult western.  One other point, this western is more dark and realistic than other western movies, but that is why it will remain a classic when other western movies fade away.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like westerns and have not seen this one, you must live in a cave.  Just kidding.  This is one of my favorite western movies of all times and it may even become one of your favorites as well.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir).
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I loved the history surrounding this book.  Only a little bored with so much time spent on the  war itself.  Could have embellished the different groups of people a little more, but overall a great read.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Was very happy with this DVD. This is my sons favorite musical. He was very happy with this purchase. Thank you
B008M721MS|5.0|It's great to talk to friends and make videos using it! I would recommend this to people who get bored easily.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Just finished the training walk through, And the game shows a lot of potential. The Artwork on the cards is fantastic, And there are several familiar faces from Gameloft's &quot;Heroes of Order &amp;Chaos&quot;. The battle cards have all the classic types. There are four races and four classes which provide plenty of variety to choose from.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|The Sigma Force novels cover a far reaching thought provoking subjects which touch many subjects that.  Rollins novels are well researched.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|First off, the resolution/visual aspect of this movie is AMAZING. I'm extremely sensitive to the SOE (Soap Opera Effect), and I was dreading this movie, based on the fact that Jackson filmed it at 60 frames per second, and it was widely reported to look \\"like a BBC low budget program\\". Fortunately, this is not the case. I have no idea what Jackson did, but this looks absolutely incredible (even more so than LOTR), and there is no SOE whatsoever that I could detect. This is probably the most visually dynamic movie I've ever seen... it simply \\"pops\\" off of the screen in an incredible fashion. I watched it on Blu-ray, no 3d, on a 1080p 47\\" LG. Not sure if the refresh rate of my own TV impacted the ultimate delivery of the movie (it's essentially a 60Hz, though it's advertised as 120Hz \\"TruMotion\\"), but I would certainly recommend all viewers adjust their TVs to 60Hz if they are sensitive to the SOE, like me- the results will take your breath away.<br /><br />This movie deserves props for some truly inventive notions brought to life, such as a crazed woodland wizard riding about on a sleigh pulled by giant rabits, an elf lord traipsing about on a moose (or elk?), and one of the most incredibly goblin riots of all time. However, much like \\"Pan's Labrynth\\", I'm not sure if you ever want your kids to watch this one, unless you fancy the notion of them waking up screaming in the middle of the night... there are some terrifying creatures in this movie that will haunt the lil' ones' dreams, most notable being the orc chief and the goblin king (not sure if those are their proper titles, but you get the idea). The goblin king, in particular, is an extremely disturbing critter that shows off some amazing CG chops by whoever created him. And of courser, Gollum is back, and he's perhaps freakier than ever, and more than enough to instill nightmares all by his lonesome.<br /><br />What came as a great surprise to me was that (young) Bilbo Baggins was so likable. In fact, he's FAR more likable than Frodo was in the LOTR series. Frodo spent most of his movies whining and crying, all whilst he twisted his face into an agonized visage, just in case you weren't sure of how miserable he was. I realize he drew a short straw, but when compared to Bilbo, he seems like an irredeemable crybaby. Instead of complaining and lamenting his fate, Bilbo embraces his unwanted quest and barrels into it with a headfull of steam, embracing those who doubt and dislike him. He's kind, generous, and irrepressible, and this turns him into the most lovable protagonist that has ever graced a LOTR film.<br /><br />I only knock off one star for some pacing issues (which has become something of Jackson's hallmark). However, rest assured- if you're an LOTR nerd (and I know there's a LOT of you out there), you will love this movie like nobody's business, and it will be a five star must-buy for you. For me, however, the movie dragged too much in the middle, and it actually felt like a three hour movie, as opposed to something like \\"The Avengers\\" or the Batman movies, which were more aggressively paced, and didn't feel like three hours to me (relax, LOTR nerds, it's just my opinion).<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a fantastic fantasy film, by any measure. Watch it in HD, turn it up, join the dwarves, and begin your own \\"Unexpected Journey\\"!ore likable than Frodo was in the LOTR series.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is pretty solid, don't really care about lyrics for the most part, but the beat/instrumentation is definitely a good listen.  It might be different than some of their other stuff, but it's daft punk still- and you can never really hate the robots.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Book held my interest.  It wasn't difficult to read, or slow.  I read it in a few days time which is really hard for me to do.  Loved it
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|Cute idea...but it shuts down every time I go to auction!  It's very frustrating, because I really like the game!
B00AEFXUL2|3.0|The case the DVD came in was ALL BUSTED UP, but at least the DVD wasn't damaged. That's the only thing that saved this review!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I never made it out to the theatre to see this film so as soon as it was available for rent I got it.  I watched it twice before I returned it and have already put the film in my cart.  I did not expect to like it as much as I did as I am not a fan of Westerns... even though this was \\"western\\" style I loved the story, the soundtrack (also in my cart), and the acting.  I must add this to my collection.  Buy with 1 click here I come!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I also like Kill Bill 1 and 2, From Dusk to Dawn, Pulp Fiction, etc... so if you have similiar tastes I believe you will enjoy this film as much as me.  If not, you might want to rent it first... it's also almost 3 hours so be prepared for the long haul!
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|Great Band always will and looking forward to hearing more from them in the future. Their sound never changes, I love their style.
B008220D5K|2.0|I tried to like this movie, I did.  I like the actors, I like comedy, I like when comedy makes fun of everyday situations we can relate to... this movie actually made me tear up and not in a good way.  It is depressing, not funny.  The couple is sooooo unhappy and really don't like their lives, barely like each other.  This is not funny and I thank my lucky stars I never got knocked up, married, and stayed with someone I didn't love.  This is a cautionary tale that should be played for all young couples - see, this sad excuse for a family could be yours!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This is one of those love it or hate it things and I love it. I love the raw emotion in the voices of the actors that you normally don't get from a musical that's been cleaned and polished for the official soundtrack. Brings tears to my eyes.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|While it has great functionality, I personally think the design of the clock face has been well thought out and is quite attractive.  It cannot sit on the Kindle as a true skin would without resetting it each time, possibly a result of the Kindle regs.  This app is one of the best and most used in my Kindle Fire. I highly recommend it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I found this puzzle game/app enjoyable.  More perhaps because I persevered through the levels without searching on the net for a solution.  The only drawback I found to this game is the lack of levels.  For the lack of Re-playability alone sets my rating at 4 stars and not 5.  Re-playability is essentially non-existent.  Like watching a suspense/mystery movie you've already seen.<br /><br />I also found having only 8 levels a little disappointing.  But I must admit, for FREE it was indeed fun while the levels lasted.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.  No IAP offers found.

B007IK44CK|5.0|Mainly action and a tiny little romance, but I didn't want to leave the seat while I was watching because I didn't want to miss any, and that didn't happen very often.  The plot was simple and I totally enjoyed the action.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome!!! Highly addictive and highly recommended!!! Fun game to play both alone and with other people! Amazing graphics. Perfect for every age young and old I'm 25 and my son is 7 we both enjoy this game 100%
B009M5CJI0|5.0|Since I read Pilars of the Earth twenty years ago, I recognized Ken Follett's keen ability to capture my imagination with his vivid imagery and historical detail.  Throw in a little romance, intrigue or revenge, and voila! you're hooked!
B0046B1KHG|4.0|I bought this movie for my 4-year old daughter. She liked it quite a bit and I suspect we are going to watch it at least a dozen more times (which is why I decided to buy instead of rent). The movie was fun to watch for adults also - engaging plot and plenty of grownup humor to keep us interested.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|My husband and I were children of the 70s into the 80s, and when we started dating, he was a huge Zeppelin fan, so this was THE perfect gift.  We have older friends who saw the concert in person.  For my hubby, this is the next best thing AND he can watch it again and again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing! I love everything about this. I really like the Sydney place my favorite part of this is the train tunnels! Thanks for creating it.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is the first book I have read regarding relationships, and probably the only one needed. After reading The Five Love Languages, I now have an understanding of the issues that have plagued my past encounters with the opposite sex. This book will restore you and your mate to new heights in your marriage or relationship. I highly recommend this book and cannot say enough good about it.<br /><br />If you or someone you know is having difficulty understanding their mate and its causing problems, you are probably speaking the wrong love language to them. Try following the exercises in this book and watch your love tank rise to the top.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great little app. gives me a great start for the day.  I like the plans and lessons options available too. reading the Bible my way.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book will having you thinking &#34;what would I do&#34;.  The story is well written with strong characters.  I would recommend.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I really, really wanted to love this movie. Aside from being a big fan of the books, I loved Jackson's take on the trilogy and was actually intrigued by the idea of stretching this movie out into 3 via bringing in material from the Silmarillion and the Appendices, especially since he and Walsh did such a good job of adapting the other books.<br /><br />I just can't bring myself to really enjoy this movie on the level I enjoyed the LoTR trilogy, and I really have a hard time summing up exactly why. The pacing of the film is the easiest thing to put my thumb on for why I'm struggling to adore it - the film felt rather like nonstop drama after awhile, to the point I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant fight scenes, especially when they were 'amped up' from the book. This is odd to me, since I bought into those with Fellowship.<br /><br />My biggest issue, honestly, is Thorin and how the story and writers handle him. I like Thorin just fine. His actor does a good job, his design is great, and so on - but my god does this movie make him seem like he's the most important dwarf ever. These elements wouldn't even bug me much had they been introduced more slowly, or as Bilbo got to know Thorin...but right from that first introduction shot of him coming into Bilbo's home, I kind of rolled my eyes a little.<br /><br />The overemphasis on Thorin went from kind of amusing to grating very quickly, especially since the film can't seem to decide who its main character is. Bilbo, in this first film, really doesn't seem to matter, and the &#34;Thorin Oakenshield is super important and has personal vendettas and so on&#34; line of writing just seemed rather like bad fanfic after awhile, and it grated. When the final climatic showdown came I just sighed and rolled my eyes at it. Of course they changed that scene to be about Thorin. Couldn't have the original scene of them all nearly burning to death, could we?<br /><br />All of that said though, there's a lot to love here. Theydid a really good job of giving all of the dwarves distinct looks and personalities, the visuals, cinematography and design are rich as ever, and the cast all look and act their parts wonderfully. The plot threads they introduced from the extended sources will be interesting to see play out, and I'm definitely going to be going to see the next film. I might not have loved it, but a lot of people did, and it's definitely worth seeing to find out what you think of it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is ideal to test and show off your new 3D TV.  I originally saw this movie in 3D in theaters and was very impressed with the home 3D viewing experience on a Panasonic TC-P55ST50.  Even without 3D, this movie is fantastic.  Wonderful storyline and fantastic visual effects with or without 3D.

B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I am going to compare four of the most popular shooter games on Android: Critical Strike, Frontline Commando, Guerrilla Bob and Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour.<br /><br />OVERVIEW<br />-Critical Strike Portable: An amazing game with excellent graphics and multi-platform multiplayer, as well as great customizable controls. Counter Strike fans will immediately recognize it, it being an almost identical copy.<br />-Frontline Commando: An interesting concept where there is limited movement, with great graphics, but Freemium ruins it, as advancing without using real money is close to impossible.<br />-Guerrilla Bob: Nice game, but very shallow and childish. Despite that, it is still fun.<br />-Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour: This game has adequate controls and amazing almost console-quality graphics, but often lags, even on a quad-core processor, and don't even try playing multiplayer without a perfect WiFi connection, as the lag will make it practically unplayable.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br />-Critical Strike Portable: 9.7<br />If you have played Counter Strike 1.6, this is the same thing, basically. If you haven't just try it. It has smooth animations, you can customize your controls, and everything is very fast-paced - just like Counter Strike.<br /><br />-Frontline Commando: 6.2<br />This is a very unusual shooter. You are behind a bunch of walls and you have to move left or right in a limited way and aim at enemies. You can duck under walls to protect yourself from bullets. This, together with having to pay real money if you want to achieve proficiency, makes it very unenjoyable.<br /><br />-Guerrilla Bob: 7.4<br />This is a third-person shooter with two sticks, so one is for movement of the character (The view is over the top) and the other is for choosing the direction of the shot. You have unlimited bullets, so ammo is not a worry. There is also an auto-aim option, which makes the game overly easy. For hardcore gamers, I do not recommend it, as it offers shallow gameplay, but it is awesome for young kids.<br /><br />-Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour: 9.2<br />Pure shooter experience, and as the title suggests, it is similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but that does not mean it is a ripoff; on the contrary, it delivers awesome and classic Xbox-like gameplay. There is a lot of lag, however, even on quad-core devices, so it is not very smooth.<br /><br />GRAPHICS<br />-Critical Strike Portable: 8.5<br />As you know if you have played Counter Strike, the graphics aren't where it exceeds. However, this one manages to put very impressive graphics in just about 30MB. It is not extremely good, but it is very good.<br /><br />-Frontline Commando: 9.0<br />One of the few areas where this game is good is graphics. Everything looks pretty real, considering the fact that this is an app.<br /><br />-Guerrilla Bob: 8.1<br />The graphics aren't something really special, but the game is not intended as something hardcore you play for the graphics, so for its purpose it does the job pretty well.<br /><br />-Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour: 9.6<br />Sometimes, this game makes me think that I can't be playing that on a tablet, but I am. Photo-realistic graphics. Period. Everything looks just amazing.<br /><br />MULTIPLAYER<br />-Critical Strike Portable: 9.9<br />The ultimate reason why this game is so awesome. The multiplayer is smooth, the lag being very rare and people are consistent, so there is a great community with games with different maps and modes. Also, you can play with people on all of the platforms the game exists, including the PC version.<br /><br />-Frontline Commando: Not Applicable<br />I can't really see it having multiplayer anyways.<br /><br />-Guerrilla Bob: 5.5<br />Okay, I guess, but it is only LAN, so only if you are under the same wireless network can you play. Still, it's cross-platform.<br /><br />-Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour: 7.9<br />Would have been perfect without the excessive lag even with a very good connection.<br /><br />MATURITY<br />-Critical Strike: 11+<br />If it was only the gore, I would have rated this 9+ maybe, but when you play multiplayer, you will constantly see very strong cursing in the chat, including the F-word many times. I am 13, played this game since I was 12, and was always okay with the cursing, but I think for 4th and 5th graders it might be just over the top, but for middle-schoolers it is fine. Keep in my mind that when you use a knife the blood will spray.<br /><br />-Frontline Commando: 10+<br />Most of the time when you shoot someone, they will die, which means they will just fall back (most of them are under cover of some wall, so we don't see that). However, sometimes, they won't die and a little blood will appear. Nothing scary.<br /><br />-Guerrilla Bob: 8+<br />There is no gore, and the violence is very cartoony.<br /><br />-Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour: 12+<br />Well, there is, just like in Critical Strike, a chat where inappropriate words will be present, but I am rating it 12+ because the graphics are better and blood will appear more realistic, but I don't think it is something especially scary.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />-Counter Strike Portable: 9.6<br />Just get it. Seriously. It is free. No ads. No in-app purchases. Great gameplay. Smooth multiplayer. No-brainer.<br /><br />-Guerrilla Bob: 7.5<br />If you don't want a really hardcore and deep gaming experience, then Guerrilla Bob is an excellent and challenging time-killer. Young kids will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />-Frontline Commando: 4.2<br />If you are willing to fork out a whole lot of cash to have a meaningful gaming experience,then this is the game for you. If not, stay away from this \\"free\\" game.<br /><br />-Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour: 8.3<br />Very good gameplay and graphics, but high price and lag, especially in multiplayer may be a problem for some. However, it is a very good, almost console-like game.
B004G6009U|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my 3 year old granddaughter whose copy of Tangled malfunctioned.  Now she's back on track and can keep up with the feisty miss with the long locks! This came in time for my grands birthday.  I love being able to provide what she needs or wants since she is halfway across America!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Loved this movie from start to finish, Owen Wilson was the absolute perfect role for this film. Would definitely recommend to others.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|O use this every night. It is tres awesomeness. It gets me to sleep every time, and I always sleep long.
B008Y768XO|5.0|the real history happened in japan and the original movie is Japanese. For those doesn't so into foreign old movie which can be a little less production and dynamism may like this one better.<br />The characters played in the movie also has different personality them the ones played in the original japanese movie.<br />To know the history of what really happen you need to research the internet. But there is tons of stories of loyal dogs in the world. Like in Argentina (I guess it was there) where the most recent history I read about a dog that completed 6 years at the cemetery where the owner was buried. Some of the employees of the cemetery gives food and water to the dog while he is waiting for his owner.<br />If you a animal lover and like to see stories about animals no matter the way it was produced you will love this one and cry.<br />In fact a pure breed akita is very rare to be found an there is few in the world. There is also a little war between Japan and US where each one has their akita breed. But if it's a real akita, this dog remain loyal to one person in the familiy and like the movie the dog personality isn't festive like several other dogs. They are more reserved and bark very very few, so don't expect benji or lessie coming out of the screen in this movie
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I downloaded this hoping it would work on my Kindle. No such luck. After login, it just sits there. Nothing. I've tried for days. Nothing.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Definitely made up for how long and drawn out AFFC felt. Lots of revelations, more questions, more fun, LOTS OF GASP WORTHY MOMENTS!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The carefully written book holds the attention of the reader as it tells Jamie's story.  The past and present are revealed together. A few times I laughed out loud and cried some too.  Overall, an enjoyable read. Not everyone will enjoy the book with its dark stories about the orphanage, but is is an endearing story.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I liked this game It was so fun you half to watch out for other sharks too ya it was really fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good but not great. I was expecting more given all the hype about it. It did have a great cast.
B003VANOFY|1.0|The headset is sleek and all, but it's entire purpose is completely defeated when it constantly won't stay connected to the wireless USB hub. It will literally connect SOMETIMES when you first boot it up otherwise your computer will make a constant connecting and disconnecting noise for a new device. I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my brother. THEY BOTH DO IT. This product is cheap and poorly made. DO NOT BUY IT or you will be out $100 or in my case $200.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am biased because I am a recovering LOTR addict.  This was litter and funnier than LOTR.  I loved the dwarves!  I am pretty sure I have a secret dwarf crush on Fili and Kili (I don't actually know how to spell their names).  Bilbo and Smegel were both amusing.  I've already watched this twice!
0316044695|5.0|this was a great book, about staying alive with what little you have. and the trust of others.. an tragic loss of good men.
B0031RS894|3.0|Doctor Who and a group of athletic students face off against a group of Sontarans.  A murder mystery also needs to be solved.  A decent read but not one of my personal favorites.
0345803485|4.0|This was not a great book by far but it is worth the read. Christian and Ana had chemistry and their relationship did appear believeable. I read the book in one night.
B0085MK2O4|5.0|I just love to hear these sonatas of Beethoveen. Glenn was supeb and most of the runs were great.  Glenn should have recorded the entire 32 sonatas of Beethoveen.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a fun game to play. However, with games like Subway Surfers, temple run is getting lower on the awesome cart, considering the fact that Subway Surfers is updating more often than Temple Run and still getting better.
B00000889Y|4.0|Tha Cramps are the incarnation of early rock's sleaziest impulses. At times the group shows us a punkabilly instrumental attack and at other times sick psychedelia. Nonetheless, they hold a weird fascination for the listener. One has to listen to their version of &#34;SURFIN' BIRD&#34; to believe how wild and crazy they can be. This release has the latter song as well as some early releases such as &#34;HUMAN FLY&#34;.To the uninitiated be prepared for some wacky and demented performances.<br /><br />John Walsh
B003G4W49C|5.0|Liked it very daring the middle is the very best part in the book. I recommend this to everyone very unique
1568363842|5.0|In my senior years, I am taking adult education at our senior center and Beginning Japanese is one of them.  This is the exact book the instructor uses.  The class had just ended but I am planning to take it over again.  Now I have my own book to work with instead of xerox copies given to me from this book.  And, yes, if I choose to continue learning Japanese, I will most definitely be needing the Version II.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Ever since I got it ,it has been hard to put it down. There are six different sharks you can upgrade,feed,and decorate. The Reef,Mako,HammerHead,Tiger,G.W.,and after first use of G.W.,an unknown fossil of a shark which you revive. And yes,I said decorate. Hope you take a bite! MWAH HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It goes into great intricate detail about the struggles and triumphs of the battle at Mogadishu and goes into the itty-gritty details of the reality of war. 10 out of 5!!!!!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the app you should get it dumb people or you are not living.<br />If you're looking at this game to get it its like you're in the world.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really love to play games on my kindle but since I got my kindle fire last December ive had it get wipe out somehow. I was playing Dragon story and switching to Pet Shop story well it tends to close me out of the games but when it got wiped out and I was forced to reset to factory settings I lost everything Ive done and its upsetting and expensive because I have put $$$ into my games and I want it all back or credited with what I spent on both games since December28th, 2012. thankyou

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I did think it was a little pricey but the fact that it held my grandsons attention and he really liked it I believe the money was well spent. I would recommend it for all ages..
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|How to Deliver the Perfect TED Talk is packed with practical ideas for delivering ANY presentation well!  I will use it and plan to recommend it to all my students!<br />Cathy Bolger,<br />Corporate Trainer<br />Presentation Skills Instructor, San Diego
B0076DELIG|4.0|The book made me empathize with those people who have no one to defend them. The story gives me faith that people like Bosch may be out there
B009AMANBA|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE AND I LOVED ON DVD. ANYTHING THAT STEVEN SPIELBURG HAS HIS HAND IN IT IS ALWAYS GOOD!
B007AMMZA4|1.0|If you are fascinated by Almodovar's obsessions with rape, kidnapping, mother-bondage, mutilation, torture and murder, this is the film for you. Personally, I hope he finds a good mental institution where he can work out his issues over the next 30 years. I will happily go through the rest of my life without ever again looking at the world through his warped eyes.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Great DVD - Perfet condition. My daughter was so excited I was able to find this move - one of her favorites!  Fast shipping too!!!
