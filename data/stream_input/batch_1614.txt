0440246024|2.0|Like the past few efforts from grisham, this one catches it's stride after a couple of boring chapters, keeps you plodding along out of mild curiosity, blazes through a bunch of frivilous events near the end, then plunges you off a cliff with no climax, and a confusing \\"resolution\\". My love for courtroom novels, and grisham's earlier work keep me searching for his long awaited return to form. This isn't it.

0316066524|5.0|Another astute reviewer called Infinite Jest the ugliest American masterpiece, and I think that's incredibly apt and precise. It is this lurching, shaggy behemoth born of DFW's obssession that checkout-line-tier junk and acclaimed literary fiction of the period--the touchstones of low and high culture--had essentially the same goal: compel the reader toward the end and along the way supercharge them with accumulated feeling or insight or appreciation for fine craft. He found it toxic. His goal was more audacious, more prescriptive: to give the reader tools to prise that gilded cage apart, to be a more conscious reader with the hope that the resultant rigor would seep into other areas of life.<br /><br />Know that it is a rigorous book. Know that the ugliness is tightly and expertly controlled, not mere sloppiness. Know that all the pleasures you'll get from this novel will be oblique in one way or another because that is the point. Know that there IS an ending, just not an Aristotelian, Shakespearean, or even postmodern one. Know that you do get a few hundred pages of connective tissue, which is satisfying in a way completely divorced from plotting considerations. I cannot say Infinite Jest was enjoyable or entertaining--it was, in dense, explosive clusters that definitely did not comprise more than half the novel. Here's what it was for most of it's length: vivid, interesting, rigorous, and most importantly, finely felt. This is different from deeply or profoundly felt, which can be captured in Realist terms, with gorgeous, crisp prose.<br /><br />Wallace sculpts inner lives in the abstract, with heaps of finely observed cuttings of information, emotion, syntax, and subtext laid alongside each other which crackle with intensity, all the more astonishing because this laser-like empathy shoots from these UGLY, sedimentary walls of text, and (at least I thought), \\"How is this possible? I spend much of the time flipping back and forth to sometimes infuriatingly factualminutiae, in the dictionary, or puzzling out tenuous connections. How could he get me to care about these characters' inner lives so minutely when the foregoing work erodes some of the pleasure I get from reading?\\" It's because the work is bound up in the book as part of Wallace's (cutting edge/old fashioned) moral approach to fiction. If Infinite Jest can inhabit you (I had to pick very carefully here--it is not only a matter of entertaining, arresting, appreciating, astonishing, or even finishing--as these all have their narcotizing aspects if engaged unconsciously) you will eventually be enriched by it. Maybe not immediately, but surely you will. Surely and eventually is better than immediately but contingent, right? And if, after all of this qualified endorsement, you're still an interested skeptic--give it two tries, maximum. I'll be frank and admit I'm contemptuous of the many one-starred reviews that can blast the book in a few sentences and slip in somewhere that they finished in a week or two. Or those tortured souls who've read the same 100 or so pages 3,4,5+ times over. Why try to turn somersaults with one hand nailed to the floor?<br /><br />I hope you'll give Infinite Jest your time. It is even more deserving of your native intelligence and empathy.

0307352145|2.0|As an extreme introvert, I'm always looking for more good reading material on the subject. Having read \\"The Introvert Advantage\\" by Marti Olsen Laney and \\"Introvert Power\\" by Laurie Helgoe, I was wondering if there's going to be another book about introversion saying something that isn't more or less repeating what another author already said.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" did deliver in that it was an exhaustive, scholarly discussion of the subject, complete with stories from public figures both past and present who are introverts. However, I found it too wordy, too detailed, too intellectual. And maybe that's why it wasn't my thing in a book. There is a big difference between right-brained and left-brained introverts. Left-brained introverts (more intellectual) may love this book and relish digesting the exhaustive factual information.<br /><br />However, as a right-brained introvert, I was looking for another strongly relational approach to the subject to give me more insight. \\"Introvert Power\\" delivered much better in this department. Helgoe's warm, conversational style was much more appealing to read. If you're a right-brained introvert, I'd recommend IP instead. I'm glad I was able to find \\"Quiet\\" at the library and didn't spend money to read it.

0765348276|4.0|Great! The aliens want to serve us! The bad news? They don't care if they cook us first or eat us raw! it seems they discovered our tasty qualities while fighting human colonists over rare planets habitable for life. Competition is fierce and deadly.<br /><br />I liked this book. But it's one of those I wish was a little better. However, I want to continue with the series and John Perry, the narrator, is a man of daring, luck and adventure.<br /><br />For half the book, we are given a technological tour of John's universe while he trains to be a soldier for the Colonial Defense Forces, as well as get to know him and his friends. It's an interesting place. In order to sign up for the CDF, you have to be at minimum 75 years old. The reasoning is after having lived a full, pleasant life on Earth, and having gained experience and maturity, you will make a terrific soldier if you are made young again. Plus, the conversation between John and his fellow recruits is hilarious. The best part though has to be that he signed up to kill evil space aliens with cool guns. Who wouldn't?<br /><br />The banter is funny, but the wars are not. The joy in having a rejuvenated and souped-up body turns a bit sour after several skirmishes and battles, but Perry turns out to be good at war.<br /><br />I think the book is too quick and breezily paced in the second half, and I couldn't understand why have the consciousness transfer method of creating soldiers when they could have made more clone mixes of Special Forces. Plus, the multi-universe travel scheme has to be to one of the most bizarre ideas I've ever read about. Wouldn't messing with realities in this manner make the universes explode or something? (At least that's what Dr. Who says ). I also had a problem believing an advertising writer could gear up mentally into a James Bond warrior so seamlessly. Lastly, I don't know why, I simply did not connect with Perry. Despite the care Scalzi took to make Perry likeable and heroic, he was a bit unfinished to me, like a pod person interrupted in its formation.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the aliens very much, murderous monsters not withstanding.a bit unfinished to me, like a pod person interrupted in its formation.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the aliens very much, murderous monsters not withstanding.
B008BLBUDQ|5.0|This book is not for the faint of heart. It's riveting, gut wrenching, shocking, and somewhat disappointing - except that it is historical. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is not necessarily a true story. The book represents a \\"lost\\" African culture. Even so, I can't help my fluffy American perspective. I live in a country with a lot of idealist values. Reading about how difficult tribal life was, is the only thing that kept this book at a five star rating for me. The child's death near the end of the book was enough to make me furious. But when I asked a history professor about it, he said that the book represented an accurate accounting. Definitely five star writing. Excellent research. Still, I wanted a happier ending. I guess real life doesn't always end that way.
0525952616|1.0|Oh, dear. This is a mess. In my opinion.<br /><br />I loved Daemon/Freedom. I eagerly opened this one and, well, yuch. It was awfully choppy, with too short and quick action scenes, no character development, or meaningful emotion. There were conversations that made no sense or were dropped with no explanation early in the first ten or so chapters. Then, about a third into the book, at first I thought I was losing interest because I've never been in the military and the toys were not clear to me. But when I went back and deciphered the acronyms and part numbers jargon, I realized it wasn't that I had to look up what the trucks, jeeps and airplanes looked like, it's that I was getting bored and the plot lagged with 30 pages of jeep love, in one part, and then another part and then another part. Ok, I'm exaggerating. A little. No, it wasn't all pages of Jeep love, or drone love, or weapon love or secret underground fort love. It was the endless pages and pages of part numbers and alphabet names without anything else there, like reading a Home Depot restocking order list for a long while.<br /><br />Later, I realized I couldn't work up spit about these characters. Kill them all, I started to think. McKinney had no depth or warmth, Odin was a Batman missing a back story that would allow any sympathy, and no one had sufficient motivation beyond being some sort of lunatic. Now, Evans I liked. He was the deepest, best written character and he had maybe five paragraphs of walkon life.<br /><br />But I finished it because the ideas were so great. Drones that function on programmed ant/swarming behavior? Cool! But then, as i finished the last three chapters, i realized to my disgust that there were plot holes you could drive a Forest Ranger pickup through.

0375842209|1.0|I usually make it a rule to read AT LEAST 100 pages of a book before deciding if I like it or not.  I confess I only made it to page 40.  I couldn't stand to waste any more time.  There are too many GOOD books out there to invest either time or money in this book.  I am AMAZED that a well-established publishing house like Alfred A. Knopf would foist this garbage on the public in the guise of a book.  There is no continuous thread of a story.  You are left to wonder from page 1, just who it is telling this story.  Answer:  You really don't want to know.  The whole book is bizarre & my best advice is to make a note of the author's name & NEVER buy anything written by him.

B005FWO3QK|5.0|Being a life-long lover of Wagner's operas, most especially, The Ring of the Niebelungen I didn't know what to expect of the more modern approach to the Ring - some of the productions of Wagner's operas are deliberately distorted and made (to my sensibilities), ridiculous. This Ring with Barenboim conducting is absolutely wonderful. The singers, without exception, are superb; and the production, compelling. I haven't watched the beginning two acts of Die Gotterdammerung as yet, but am struck by how much of the staging, while simple, even stark, gives one the feeling of another dimension that the Gods inhabit. The acting makes use of every word of the text, both facially and bodily. I am delighted with this product.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Pet Shop Boys' last album, Yes, was rather lackluster.  It had some good moments, but overall it seemed a bit flat.  Before that, Fundamental was pretty good yet still failed to live up to the truly great albums like Very, Behaviour, or even Release.  So it was with a cautious ear that I listened to their latest offering, Elysium.  I am pleased to report that this album redeems all past mistakes.  PSB has crafted a truly blissful offering filled with intelligent and mature electropop.<br /><br />The most striking aspect of Elysium that most people will notice is that the album isn't a four-on-the-floor dance record.  It's not Nightlife.  In fact, it's closer to a combination of Behaviour and Release.  It's got pop ballads and mid-tempo gems, but nothing for clubs.  This isn't a bad thing...as PSB seems to really nail it when they go this route.  I read some of the other reviews and it seems many were disappointed because they were expecting something more upbeat.  But if one listens without expectations, they will be pleasantly surprised.  There isn't a single track on this album that I want to skip, which is nice as the last album was so sketchy.<br /><br />The best tracks on here are definitely \\"Leaving\\", which has some really chic arrangement, \\"Invisible\\" is melodic and heartfelt, \\"Breathing Space\\" is like a more accessible version of Release's \\"Birthday Boy\\", \\"Ego Music\\" is erratic and experimental, reminiscent of something you'd hear from the French duo Air, but still works wonderfully here.  In fact, starting with \\"Ego Music\\" the album delves into full concept album mode.  Mixing broadway-style numbers like \\"Hold On\\" with the gloriously dark and abstract \\"Everything Means Something\\".  Truly mesmerizing stuff!<br /><br />This is truly the Pet Shop Boys' most beautiful and lush album to date.  I truly hope the people giving it negative reviews will click to this album.  It truly cannot be missed.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|Loved the theater simulcasts in HD this year, and saw the PBS airing of \\"Wagner's Dream\\" last night. Fantastic music combined with stunning visual experience.  Wagner seems to sucessfully adapt to minimalist or interpretive staging better than any other composer's work.  I usually detest productions that mess with opera (Santa Fe's staging of Magic Flute in business suits, for instance), but this really works, really!  Get the Blu-Ray.  If you don't have Blu-Ray, get the player and order the Blu-Ray version of this set!<br /><br />DO NOT ALSO ORDER THE SEPARATE DISK \\"Wagner's Dream\\"[[ASIN:B008MXMFRI Wagner's Dream [Blu-ray]]] I have just been informed that it is included in the Ring set (the fifth disk). Amazon forgets to tell you this -- however this is a great disk, but you don't have to buy it separately.  The interviews with Hunter, just up from Paris, Texas, are charming...and when he opens his mouth to sing, this man from just south of the Oklahoma border simply blows you away! This video really makes you appreciate all the work that goes into a new production.

B00466H3F4|5.0|Babe was a surprise contender for Best Picture in 1995. It has elements which make it sound like a formula for a cloyingly sweet kiddie film, namely talking animals, a pig that wants to be a sheepdog, singing mice, a farmer who seldom talks paired with a wife who seldom stops talking.  But the component parts were so skillfully crafted, so lovingly combined into a heart-warming and tear-inducing modern fairy tale, that they became a favorite movie for millions of people, a movie which will stand the test of time.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition is an improvement over the DVD mostly because the resolution is increased for proper presentation on today's larger television screens. Fine detail is good but not spectacular, colors and contrasts are sharp.  The talking animals are consistently lifelike and smoothly believable.  Voice characterizations are remarkably well done, particularly Babe, the old sheep Maa, the sheepdogs Rex and Fly, and the self-described \\"anorexic duck\\" named Ferdinand.<br /><br />James Cromwell is Farmer Hoggett, who wins a piglet at the fair.  Because Hoggett is a man of very few words, playing the character made Cromwell worry that he wasn't really acting.  Director Chris Noonan assured him that he was doing more acting without words than most actors did with words, and his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor proved the point.<br /><br />The simple story is told with charm and emotion. The lyrically pastoral setting has at its center a farmhouse with an almost fantasy appearance, occupied by the farmer and his wife who are a comically matched pair of opposites.  And the animals are amazing, with the Jim Henson creatures being so lifelike that you have to watch the film two or three times to tell the mechanical creations from the live animals.<br /><br />Watch Babe with the kids.  Or maybe watch it on your own, so they don't see the moistening of your eyes when the little pig is told by the mean spirited cat that pigs are only kept by humans for use as food; or when Farmer Hoggett sings Babe out of his depression; or when the two of them together triumph at the sheepdog trials.  This is filmmaking that restores a sense of magic to the craft, and creates a story worth visiting again and again.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I first heard Bob Dylan when I was 12 years old, too many years ago. I can still remember my reaction- I could not believe how grating the voice I heard over the radio sounded. Well, that was many years ago and over time I not only came to appreciate Dylan's voice, but I believe that in many of his songs, his vocal talent is without parallel in its delivery, timing, and deep emotional expression.<br /><br />As much as I love Dylan, his voice apparently is showing the strain from too many concerts and too many cigarettes. Most of the time he sounds like he is gargling, rather than singing, or more like Louie Armstrong (another artist I love).<br /><br />The bottom line to the Tempest, his latest album, is that he once again shows his mastery, but it is not for everyone.<br /><br />Dylan is by far my favorite musician and songwriter (the music I would take to a desert island if I could only bring one artist).  If you are new to Bob Dylan, I would not start with this album but listen to his earlier work first.  Those who write this may be one of his best albums either have not listened to his earlier albums, or else they listened so long ago (Dylan's been around and so have I) that they forgot.<br /><br />Dylan's range and creativity have decreased over the years. There was a time, beginning with Highway 61 Revisited, then with John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, and others, when it was hard to believe that the same Dylan did the album as the one before.<br /><br />Now, since Time Out of Mind in 1997 Dylan has been on what is probably his longest stretch of similarity. The Tempest breaks no new ground, but continues in the vein of his recent work.<br /><br />Dylan used to write unique and timeless songs, such as Desolation Row, Joker Man, Changing of the Guards ....  the list goes on and on, and is long. Now, in this album \\"Long and Wasted Years\\" sounds like a weaker sequel to Brownsville Girls. \\"Tin Angel\\" reminds me of Man with a Long Black Coat. The sequel is rarely as good as the original, and ever since Time Out of Mind, Dylan's albums have had a more sequel-like quality, at least for me.<br /><br />The title song \\"Tempest\\", all 14 minutes, simply does not rise to the glory of other extended Dylan songs such as Hurricane, Desolation Row, Sad Eyed Lady and others.<br /><br />Of course, Dylan at a mildly disappointing level still overshadows most songwriters at their best. Dylan's \\"average\\" work would be another artist's tour de force. His music always contains insights and imagery that ring true and bears at least additional listening. That is true for this album as well.<br /><br />There are many reviews analyzing specific songs. For me, Pay in Blood and Scarlet Town are great songs with great lyrics and presence. Most of the songs are ones I will listen to frequently. I was expecting not like the song, the Tempest (I could not quite get why Dylan wanted to write about a topic that has been way over explored), I will say this: although the music gets monotonous fairly quickly, in some respects it is one of his better pieces of poetry. The twist he gives to the imagery with the watchman at the end of the song (I will not give it away here), was in my view one of his cleverest lyrical moves in a long time.<br /><br />Dylan continues to bring vivid imagery and depth to his writing.I am also a fan of his rhyming abilities (who else could create a powerful image rhyming \\"pronounce\\" with \\"ounce\\"?).<br /><br />There are great lyrics in this album, lots of religious imagery, but I am disappointed that Dylan does not play harmonica on a single song. I think Dylan is the most creative powerful harmonica player I have ever heard...<br /><br />As a long time Dylan fan and one who listens to his music on a regular basis, one thing I know for sure that when it comes to Dylan, he is usually one step ahead and sometimes it takes me a while to appreciate his work. This is a compliment, because it is a further testament to the depth of his work that we who listen have to work ourselves to fully appreciate him.<br /><br />Dylan's new work is always compared to what he has done before. Since he has done so much, Dylan cannot always live up to expectations and he never has (since he has almost always been five steps ahead of everyone else on the music scene). I hope this is not his last album, and that next time he throws away his canvas from the last 15 years and surprises himself and us with something extraordinary and different. If not, that's still okay, because Dylan has given so much to the world he is actually entitled to rest on his laurels.

B006H5120E|5.0|This review is for the 3D Blu Ray.  Having watched Titanic in the theaters in 1997, owning it on VHS, and then on the first DVD release I knew that the Blu Ray would be a must have, especially the 3D version.  I've probably seen the movie about 50 times before this release.  So, I knew there wouldn't be a lot of 3D shots that would jump out at me.  Besides, that expectation is a little much considering this movie was shot before today's technology was in use.<br /><br />Firstly, as many times as I have seen this movie I was still very very presently surprised by how much detail I'd missed all these years, from the very opening scene until the end.  The 3D really adds to the movie in such a way that it enhances all the detail of each scene.  There are many times when I honestly felt as though I was on the Titanic or that the Titanic might sail straight into my bedroom.  That was new for me and I've seen a lot of 3D movies at home.  Keep in mind that I'm watching this on a 32\\" Vizio.  So, not really a large television at all.  I would definitely recommend the 3D version to those who love 3D movies or just really love Titanic and would like to feel like they are apart of it.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|I liked the book. The decription of the legal system and the way justice is carried out was very well written. I got a bit frustrated due to constant references to the original book. This may be necessary for a novice reader of the Bennet's story, but I would guess that most people buying this book understands the implications of the title.<br />Having said the above, I give the book a strong 3 star due to the fact that it is one indeed one of the best fan fics I have ever read. Thanks
1451696205|5.0|I wasn't sure what I wanted to read for my next book so I chose something that's totally out of character for me and boy did it pay off.  \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a fiction book written through the eyes of \\"Charlie,\\" a high school freshman.  It's written as many letters to an anonymous receiver (the reader).  Charlie documents his observations and struggles with getting through Freshman year as a kind of odd loner type.  The book touches on a lot of issues such as homosexuality, mental illness, molestation, rape and domestic violence but still maintains an overall light feel.  I read this book in 24 hours which for me is really fast.  It was easy to stay engaged with and never got boring.  I HIGHLY recommend.<br /><br />5 out of 5 Stars.
0446572993|3.0|David Baldacci puts the reader through a fast-paced obstacle course in The Innocent, never allowing time to decompress as the story unfolds in terse chapters, averaging about 3 pages in length.  This rapid-fire delivery gives the reader a feel for Will Robie's complicated life.  We begin to feel conflicted about Will.  He's a \\"stone cold killer\\" and all, but, geeze, the guy's life stinks! ...and, all for the good of the country?<br /><br />Hints of chinks in Will's armor become evident as he deviates from his usual MO of kill-or-be-killed and becomes the protector of a young girl.  His humanity creeps further out from hiding when he admits his attraction to two, very different, women.  As he lets down his guard and interacts with them, his social skills are laughable.  His idea of seductive repartee is just shy of a grunt...yet, we understand.  The poor guy's charisma has taken a beating: his charm blunted by years of trying to avoid bullets and bombs. Who has time for such nicety's? If Will reaches the ripe old age of 45, it will be a miracle ...and most likely from the vantage point of a coffin.<br /><br />The part of The Innocent that stretched reality too much for me was the concept that this \\"stone cold killer\\" has latent altruistic tendencies that would make Gandhi humble.  I mean, really, I've reared 4 teenagers and the only thing that kept me from killing them was a fear that my gene pool would die out!  So, how can I believe a killer would put up with Julie: a cheeky 14 yr-old, wise-cracking, smart-a##, girl who thinks she knows everything?  Come on, wouldn't he just shoot her with his trusty Glock and be done with her?  I'm tempted, and I don't have his creds. (BTW, I'm kidding about my children, of course.  I would never harm them. They are my last line of defense against Nursing Home admission.)<br /><br />On the subject of `shooting', there is one part of the book that, I must say, I found troubling and extremely offensive. Early in the story, Baldacci included the gruesome murder of an infant.  I almost stopped reading the book at that point. This inclusion contributed nothing to the story line and certainly distanced me from the book, and author. Aside from that disturbing fact, the book is well written and engaging.  Over-all, The Innocent earned 3 of 5 hearts from this reviewer.included the gruesome murder of an infant.  I almost stopped reading the book at that point.

0525953728|5.0|It is rather refreshing for this man to stand up and fight for the freedom of expression and voice.  This man was a proud member of the Seals and fought long and hard, with the blood sweat and tears throughout the years.  I am happy to say that as an American there is no greater joy than seeing him take his liberty and write the truth from his eyes.<br /><br />With all of that said - about the book!!<br /><br />It was a very easy read and written as if you were being told it.  I actually at various points felt as if I were watching a documentary that was nothing but pictures as I imagined it with a voice-over detailing what these pictures meant.<br /><br />\\"Mark Owen\\" is extremely humbled by his life long experiences in the Seals and I really enjoyed the flashbacks which shed light around certain circumstances that have happened to him that relate to earlier experiences as a child and/or in training.<br /><br />The book is not about Mark Owens expedition to kill Bin Laden, but what it is about is the struggles that go into becoming one of the greatest fighting forces in the world - ** And after two times reading it he refers to his fellow seals when he makes those statements.<br /><br />It is much more of a \\"I am so honored to have ever shared the distinction of being a seal than I am a killing machine who was on the bin laden raid\\" book. Once you read this book you will realize exactly what I mean after the first chapter!<br /><br />With all of that said, I received the book at 2:15PM EST on the day of the release and didn't finish or stop for that matter until 9pm EST.  The book was such a fantastic read that as most fantastic movies, it became a must re-read which was already done.<br /><br />I have already purchased several more copies for my Father (Former Marine), My Wife (Former Marine) and 2 additional for my children when they get older.<br /><br />The book it a testament to what can be done if you have the courage to try, the strength in your mind to endure, and will to never quit.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist serves such a great by teaching life lessons and it personally brought out my long lost imagination. I loved how in the book there are so man lessons to be learned and it really makes a person look at themselves in a different light. The main character (Santiago) travels from Spain to Egypt in search of his treasure that is supposedly there. Along the way he learns all about his personal legend and how to listen to omens to guide him through his spiritual journey to finding his treasure. Through his troubles and success the reader begins to really understand what it is to follow their dreams and realize their personal legend.<br /> While Paolo Coelho speaks of personal legends, I found myself reflecting back to what my own set of goals in life are. This is why I would suggest to any avid reader to read The Alchemist. It teaches many purposeful lessons, while keeping the reader intrigued and thinking deeply about their goals and if they are living their life with purpose. Some people believe that The Alchemist preaches Paulo Coelho's ideas too much. This is not the case because Paulo brings in many ideas of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam religion. Paulo Coelho takes all the great parts of these religions and adds them into one to help Santiago realize his personal legend and guide him to his beloved treasure. While Santiago is open to all these beliefs he is able to read the signs from all types of gods and omens which was very refreshing. To read this novel you have to be open to all type of life styles and being flexible with new ideas.<br />Santiago even talks to the material world when he talks to the sun and wind late in the book. This type of imagination kept me guessing and made me feel like I had to keep reading. If you are looking for a book to give you a different perspective on life or really challenge your thoughts I advise you to read The Alchemist. Stay open to new ideas and your reading experience with this novel should be a great one.

0307951529|5.0|If the thought of starting a business is intriguing but seems too daunting a task for you, start with this book.<br /><br />I watched my dad start a business 10 years ago and swore off entrepreneurship because of the negative impression I had from watching his experience. Entrepreneurship to me meant having more freedom, not losing a lot of money and sacrificing 2 years with my family. Seeing entrepreneurship through the eyes of so many people in this book who've done it in fields that are accessible to most of us made it feel much more tangible and attainable for me.<br /><br />I found myself taking notes throughout the entire book, taking ideas from Chris and those he interviews. I hope to put them to the test in the coming months. If nothing else, it showed me how many options exist in today's economy and helped enable me to expand my horizons with the kinds of business models that are possible.<br /><br />Also, I've noticed a couple of comments and reviews from people here who seem to think this book only speaks to a wealthier group, so here's a little bit about me: I make slightly more than the median salary in my city, have 3 kids and a wife who says home with them, and live in a modest townhouse that's worth far less than the median home in my city. Oh, and my savings would barely last 2 months if I lost my job today.<br /><br />So let's not pretend that this book is only relevant for people who already have it all financially. Plenty of people in the book started with nothing - no college degree and no wealthy connections - and made it.<br /><br />I tend to be pretty cynical about anyone claiming to have the ticket to a better life, but I don't think Chris is here to punch a ticket for you. He's simply telling the stories of those who've been successful at starting their own businesses with very little startup cost while detailing how they did it in the hopes that it helps others pursue that path. I think that story is applicable to just about everyone.

B004V6MWFU|4.0|Since I just took up the uke I was excited about the concept of him making a entire album playing it. Yes, I liked most of the songs & no I wasn't expecting PJ, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, but none of the original songs really stood out for me to get excited enough about that I wanted to hear several times. Overall I want to say he was just too earnest for me. I loved \\"Sleepless nights\\" as I have loved that song since Gram Parson & Emmylou Harris sang it. After that I skip to the last 2 tracks of two old standards, \\"tonight you belong to me\\" & Dream a little dream of me\\" I mean, -  who woulda thought Eddie Vetter would be singing those songs on a ukulele. That took a lot of guts on his part & I loved it. He's being so earnest -sticking his head out in new territory.

B005LAIHAO|1.0|I'm not sure I can explain \\"The Cold Light of Day\\", not knowing the inside story as to why the movie was made or how it was made with the likes of Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver. I do know that the lead actor in the film is Henry Cavill, who will soon be playing the lead role in the Superman movie \\"Man of Steel\\". As far as Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver go, this is what they call in the business, a paycheck or favor movie. As far as Cavill goes, my only assumption is that the studio, Warner Brothers, wanted to get Cavill's face out there before \\"Man of Steel\\" happened. I'm not sure \\"The Cold Light of Day\\" did them any favors.<br /><br />Cavill, I'm sure is a fine actor, but given the material here, he is an after thought in the midst of poor filming, poor direction, poor scripting and just an overall train wreck of a film. Cavill plays Will, a small business owner who goes on vacation to see his family in Madrid, all the while receiving phone calls galore about his business sliding into bankruptcy back home. This is just one of the pointless and irrelevant plot points.<br /><br />After accidentally tackling his brother's girlfriend on the boat and knocking her head into a railing, he decides to go to town for some pointless reason. I think it was to get ointment for the gash on her head. So, he dives into the water and swims to shore, leaving his family behind. When he returns, the family boat is gone and the spy, terrorist thriller begins. At this point, he looks out into the straight where his family boat should be, from the beach and sees nothing. Then we have to endure a ridiculous long pan from his view across a bunch of people and eventually the camera lands on Will's stunned face after what had to be a twenty second shot. After about five seconds, I sighed, as we endure another ten seconds of irrelevant stuff. This is the kind of stuff that plagues the film.<br /><br />Moments later, as the \\"Taken\\", \\"Bourne Legacy\\" wannabe film goes into full swing, we have to endure a four or five minute scene with terrible lighting. There are scenes in the film where all of a sudden, Will is just somewhere. We don't know how he got there or why he got there, but of course moments later, he was supposed to be there.<br /><br />The scripting is terrible. Will, at one-point yells to a man at the American embassy, \\"My families missing and I'm wanted for a murder I didn't commit!\\"<br /><br />I don't know what \\"The Cold Light of Day\\" was intended to be. Was it a vehicle for Cavill so that people could see his face before \\"Man of Steel\\"? Was it intended to be good or was it thrown together. I'm not sure, but the bottom line is, the movie was terribly done. There are too many characters and there are too many things that don't matter. There are unreasonable plateau's between Will meeting people and them helping or hurting him. Bottom line, just because a movie has Bruce Willis in it, doesn't mean its good.

B009369Z8A|5.0|Oscar season has officially begun with the arrival of \\"Lawless\\", the best movie of the year so far. The movie is based upon a 2008 novel \\"The Wettest County in the World\\", written by Matt Bondurant, who is the grandson and grand nephew of the characters depicted in the film. The film, set in prohibition-era Franklin County, Virginia, is an authentic and truthful depiction of life as they knew it in bootleg heavy, depression-era Virginia.<br /><br />The story centers around the Bondurant brothers, Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia Lebeouf), Jack being the younger and more timid of the three. In fact, Forrest and Howard, can not at all be described as anything close to timid.<br /><br />Prohibition is in place, yet moonshine is run back and forth from county line to county line without any trouble. There's an unwritten acceptance of a business that hasn't really caused any trouble. Yet, things are beginning to brew in Chicago with many now well known gangsters thriving, the government is cracking down. It is just a matter of time before that crack down reaches them in the hills of Virginia. So, unless the Bondurant's want trouble, they have to begin to pay the government for the pleasure of continuing to do business. That doesn't sit well with Forrest and Howard.<br /><br />The movie, written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat is an absolute stunner. Not necessarily for the images depicted on screen, but for the quality of the film, given that Nick Cave has only written three screenplays since 1988. Twenty-four years and only two prior scripts and Nick Cave may just be one of the biggest hidden secrets in Hollywood. Known mostly for his music, but Cave has delivered a tight, can't take my eyes off the screen, Oscar night guarantee.<br /><br />The authenticity of the film and the beauty of the cinematography is what film making is all about. The creators took us back in time nearly a century and never once do you question its validity and never once do you want to miss a single scene. The humor is perfect and the violence is harsh and realistic. You feel the tenseness and the unpredictable nature of what the film could possibly do at any given moment.<br /><br />I'm surprised that it's already September and I've yet to see a film that made me mention the word Oscar. \\"Lawless\\" will be part of Oscar night. Screenplay, direction and performances by Guy Pierce, Shia Lebeouf, Jessica Chastain and Dark Knight's Tom Hardy are all going to be at least considerations. If you like great cinema, don't miss \\"Lawless\\". Although, this is also one of those movies that will have a nice long life on people's tongues and video.d never once do you want to miss a single scene.

B005LAIGL4|4.0|Sometimes, less is more. That is the case with a new movie called \\"Premium Rush\\". It is the story of New York City bike messengers and most specifically a top-notch bike messenger named Wilee, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\\"Dark Knight Rises\\", \\"Inception\\" and the upcoming \\"Looper\\"). He rides like he has a death wish, having removed the brakes from his bikes and using his instincts and quick wits to navigate complicated New York City traffic and sidewalk situations.<br /><br />Thousands of messages are trafficked throughout New York City everyday by bicycle messengers, but the one that Wilee gets on this day, brings suspense and danger to an already suspenseful and dangerous job. \\"Premium Rush\\" plays out like a high stakes poker game, revealing one card at a time and then upping the ante in the second act with high stakes, bluffs and payoff.<br /><br />\\"Premium Rush\\" isn't complicated. At a glance, it is a pretty straightforward action suspense thriller with a pretty traditional map. What it is though, is a well done and extremely real look inside the world of a New York City bike messenger. Unlike a lot of movies these days, \\"Rush\\" takes a simple premise and didn't try to blow it out of proportion, but instead they gave us clear insight into who the characters were and what doing what they do entailed. \\"Rush\\" was so real, in fact, that Gordon-Levitt actually sliced open his arm rolling up over a taxi in a very important scene, requiring 31 stitches in the middle of filming.<br /><br />\\"Premium Rush\\" is a stylish and hip ride through every corner of New York City you could imagine. The tightly packed film doesn't take up too much of your time and actually has about the same length as a movie, as it takes Wilee to deliver the highly dangerous message. Is it worth a trip to theatre, sure, if you like your action real and personal. Truth is, special effect driven movies are overrated. \\"Rush\\" dared to be something that most movie creators these days have forgotten and for that, I recommend it completely.for that, I recommend it completely.

B008BO61BE|5.0|I was at the US Festival 83 Heavy Metal Day and the line up was great, I had some favorite bands that I wanted to see and some of the bands I had only heard of -Judas Priest_ was a band I only heard of. I can still remember being towards the front of the stage and waiting to see what the band sounded like. Well as you can imagine, the sound of Judas Priest coming through a 50 foot stack of amps on the side of the stage was amazing, I remember thinking these guys Rock! and the sound of Halford's Harley blasting through those same amps actually made the ground in the park rumble, there was nothing like that. So after this CD/DVD reissue came out, the first thing I did was plug it into the DVD player to see how much of the concert I remembered and it was amazing to relive an event that I was at over 30 years ago. This DVD catches their performs \\"spot on\\".<br />I just listened to the CD on the way home from work today and I have to admit that it has been many, many years, since I've listed to this album front to back, I have the greatest hits, but listening to the album today, I had forgotten how great all of the songs were. I'll be playing this cd for a while. My recommendation is; get it! They did crank up the volume but over all it's still pretty darn good. I would say that Defenders of the Faith is the one CD I was most disappointed in the remaster, they completely blew any sonic quality on that album. Screaming For Vengeance holds its own pretty well on the sonic end. I've heard better remasters, but this one is a 7 or 8 on the 1 to 10 scale.

It seemed as if she was lip syncing everything, which I don't have a problem with if she's dancing.<br /><br />However, she didn't dance like she used to a few years ago. I know that things have changed, but there was one thing I always counted on it was her awesome dance skills. Her backup dancers and the stage productions were done really well, so it kind of filled the gap.<br /><br />It was okay for me, only because I expected Britney to have the crisp dancing I remember. There was some good remixes of old favorites and even a cover of a Rihanna song that wasn't bad. There's also a surprise guest at the end, but I don't know how most will feel about that when they find out who it is.<br /><br />Overall, watchable, but if you're looking for the old Britney, you're out of luck.

0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist Review<br /> The Alchemist is a high quality book that overall, was worth my time. While Santiago, the main character, is on his journey to discover his personal legend, the author gives readers valuable lessons, an interesting story, and insightful opinions to reflect on. The main idea of this book consists of morals and life lessons from a catholic man's point of view.<br /> The author, Paulo Coelho, uses Santiago to express his opinions and morals. Throughout the book, Santiago's many conversations and actions teach readers the value of patience, dedication, and many other virtues. One example comes from a scene where Santiago is saying goodbye to a girl he loves named Fatima. Fatima tells Santiago she will wait for him while he searches for his treasure and will not give up hope. Also, the author shows readers how important it is to take advantage of the opportunities you get and to pursue your dreams through Santiago's actions.<br /> Another thing I enjoyed about this book is that it was broad enough so that all types of people could interpret the symbols and lessons however they wanted.  The Alchemist is simple and to the point. It was open ended so that readers who were willing to dive deep into Coelho's words could understand and enjoy its complexity. On the other hand, readers who just wanted entertainment got an enjoyable, relaxing, quick read. However, there are parts of the book that were too unrealistic for me to take seriously and that I did not enjoy. One scene is where Santiago tries to turn himself into the wind and has conversations with the desert and sun. This scene was a little too far-fetched for me to grasp it's meaning and understand what the author was trying to communicate.<br /> Overall, The Alchemist is a book with an interesting story and has a lot of potential. Its rich words capture many readers attention and in my opinion, was worth the experience.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The insights provided are so relevant to many people in our lives...maybe even ourselves.  I found it helpful as a parent of an introvert, and it opened my eyes to many introverts around me.  Lots of practical ideas.  I recommend the book to everyone.
0525953728|3.0|This may be the shortest 300 page book you'll ever read. The blank pages between chapters(19)are not numbered, but they're counted. That said, I enjoyed the book, but I wanted more. It is difficult to write a  non-fiction, first person account of such an historical event from a posture of anonymity.<br />If you like intense military chronicles try \\"War\\" by Sebastian Junger. \\"No Easy War\\" is a satisfying peek inside Seal Team Six, a first hand account of the execution of a mass murderer and a quick read. Enjoy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very good book. It was captivating from start to finish. I'm excited that there is a movie being made about the book. The characters are very real and seem to leap off the page. This book is definitely a page turner and worth the read. Hoping for a second book as I was hoping justice would truly be served.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Every other page is about sex. There is nothing  else.  Sadistic. Poorly written. I can't believe someone's mind would revolve around this theme page after page. Ugh!!! First book bad enough, the second one I couldn't get half finished.. Might work for some, but not for me.
B006H5120E|5.0|Once again Mr. Cameron gives us an outstanding 3d movie. This looks perfect.  I could only wish that all 3d movies looked this good. Nothing  will jump out of the screen, but the added depth is a bonus while watching the movie. Stunning, really stunning. I think this gets my top vote, even above Avatar, I can't say enough about this movie!
B007MDB71O|4.0|I am an ERB fan and this movie followed the book very well.  The special effects were done very well.
B005C9YZKU|4.0|The blu ray is beautiful. I have this on hddvd and it's amazing to see. I wanted to watch this is 3d so I had to buy the blu ray.  Really nice to watch in 3d.  The globe.....I'm not impressed with the size of the globe for the price. I was expecting it to be classroom size, fact it's the size of two very small basket balls. Hope this helps you decide.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Whale Rider is an inspiring film filled with hope, courage, and perseverance. Twelve-year-old Pai seeks desperately for approval and acceptance from her stubborn grandfather, whose feminist behavior rejected the thought of having a granddaughter. Pai's family waited anxiously for the arrival of their new descendant, Pai's twin brother.  Her brother was expected to be the next leader in line; however his death after birth left only Pai to be the most recent descendant. Women were not leaders in this tribe, and Pai's grandfather refused to accept her, claiming he has no use for her. Pai on the other hand knew what her destiny was and would not give up on it or her grandfather. She trained herself just as the boys in her village were being trained by her grandfather. In fact, she was able to do things that those boys had failed at. At the climax, Pai fulfills her desire to make her grandfather proud when she climbs up on a dying whale and leads it back into the water to live. By proving herself worthy and courageous, young Pai changes the hearts of all those around her, especially her beloved grandfather.<br /><br />  Whale Rider relates to World Religion in that they are a native tribe filled with culture. They can easily be compared to indigenous religions. They have a great respect for their ancestors, as mentioned multiply times in the movie. Their tribe displayed singing and dancing rituals, and opened a \\"sacred school of learning\\". Also, the women's role plays a big part of the movie and can relate to World Religion. Pai's grandfather did not accept her as a descendant because she was female, and females were not destined to be leaders. The women's role was to stay at home, bear children, and raise their families. Males were seen as dominant and chief leaders.

1401234542|5.0|This story is one of the most in depth, impressive, and driven books I have ever read in a comic book. The story is deep, engaging, and it will make Sinestro one of your favorite characters, if he isn't already.  The way it unfolds and develops, coupled with the intermittent action sequences and beautiful artwork, make this story one of the greatest comic books I have ever read. In my mind it isn't as great as the Sinestro Corps War arc, but it is definitely the second greatest of the New 52. (Just behind Court of the Owls.)

B000002GWJ|5.0|In 1980 someone whose pants I desperately wanted visitation rights to instead gave me this. They were married. It would never have worked. I was very put out trying to make sense of the message, thinking I had been short changed. It was on tape to boot-you remember those things, cassettes...shudder. I know, I know-there are cassette fan clubs but really. So, when I had recovered, a pint of Guinness or two later and spent many a lonely hour in my single bed, singly alone listening to this I came to accept the inevitable. Instead of being short changed, I had been given a treasure. It remains the only Tom Waits album I still listen to entirely. Tell a lie I loathe \\"Somewhere\\". But it has nine stand-up and salute tracks including \\"Red Shoes by the Drugstore\\" and of course \\"Blue Valentine\\". If you like smoky, torch ballad jazz with raspy vocals and piano soul then you just might like this. I did. I still do. And wherever you are today Mrs-cheers!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the book was so well written. with twists and turns that kept you wanting more. It was sexy without being raunchy. I recommend it daily to friends!
B00000INM1|5.0|Yes the Knopfler brothers Mark and David are good guitarists and I did see them play in their stadium era, and they were skilled and polished. But most of what they have done just does not rattle the side of my tea cup. Except for this album. Now, I fell over \\"Sultans of Swing\\" when it had radio play on initial release. It was a cracking little band number-I thought must be a pub band putting in the hard yards of slog playing covers etc. On the strength of the single, I bought this album and was terribly disappointed for the first two hundred listens. I know loving music is a dirty job but sum'un has to do the business. Anyhow, as time moved on and I realised that \\"Waterline\\" was a peon to the Tyne, I kind of fell over the edge of this one and embraced with sweaty Geordie arms and now I rate it as one of me all time classics. But, it is still not brilliant mind! Just reet classic. The rest following this was just extended drivel but if it burns brightly for you, then I say enjoy-as long as it does no harm to mouse or child. But for me, they never did better than this first, almost journeyman offering.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The movie was great but i read the book first so it definitely took away from it. I saw the movie in the theatre and was disappointed. I know its hard to transfer inner monalogue to screen bht they had not problem in twilight. I expected more. If you havent read the book its a good movie bjt they downplayed peeta in the movie and kedt out some important parts. Good casting. Woody harrelson was perfect for the role. President snow too. Exactly who i imagined when i read the book. My arvice is watch the movie just don't read the book first so you can enjoy it.

0743289692|4.0|I usually don't read autobiographies, as they can bore me.  But this one had me from the get go.  Ayaan's story is important to hear, and will teach you about the sadness of oppressive societies.  It's an eye opening book - and even though we are \\"aware\\" that these things go on, to hear a first hand, honest account is so incredibly educational.  My heart goes out to all the Mulsims who have suffered, especially the woman.  I believe the faith can be good, just when things become extreme - bad things can happen.  My thanks goes to the author for being so brave and writing her story.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Let's face it, even an icon has his ups & downs. Not all that glitters is gold. But think Dylan has stuck the mother lode this time.If Modern Times was another classic and Together Through This Life a bit of a let down but far from a train wreck, Tempest shows Dylan shaking off the chill of going not so gently into that not so good night.<br /><br />Duquesne Whistle is a jaunty, haunting opener, self-consciously invoking a bygone era. The gorgeous Soon After Midnight harks back to the likes of Bye & Bye, Moonlight or Beyond the Horizon. But if things seem to be going the way of wistful reverie, skies get redder and clouds darker with the hypnotic Narrow Way.<br /><br />If Early Roman Kings owes a bit too much to Mannish Boy, it's hardly a first if you go back to the beginning of Dylan's career. Amateurs borrow professionals steal. Musically, he's only doing what the likes of Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson did long before him. Granted Dylan never had their chops on the guitar but that's missing the point. Meanwhile, the band here are no slouches. And while they may lack the inspired mayhem that brought us Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61, they respectfully set the scene for this dark, restless album.<br /><br />On Long & Wasted Years, his rusted out pipe of a voice has never been so effective. Elsewhere, Pay In Blood is the most pissed off I've heard Dylan in years and this where the body count starts to rise. Other standouts include the ominous, brooding Scarlet Town and Tin Angel, proof Dylan's narrative skills have yet to wane.<br /><br />The ambition of the title cut cannot be denied. A maze-like narrative with a tender thread to see you through to the other side. Whether he's talking about the ship of state or a state of mind, or both Dylan lets you choose from among many metaphors here. And while I'm willing to stand corrected, I believe this clocks in as the longest song he's ever cut in the studio.<br /><br />Leave it to Dylan to end the album with an unexpected lump in the throat. Roll On John is a fond, if strangely belated farewell to John Lennon. Delivered some 32 years after his death, its hard to tell whether a little self-mockery plays a part or not. Regardless, it's a moving coda, painting a complex portrait of a now revered figure.<br /><br />If the career renaissance that began with Time Out of Mind ends here, Tempest is a hell of an Elephant Graveyard. If anything it leaves the future open to question while at the same time questioning the past. \\"I ain't dead yet, the bells still ring. I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman Kings.\\"<br /><br />While certain to have it's detractors, Tempest is another strong effort. As for the best way to approach this album, I think Tin Angel sums it best: \\"Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes\\"fond, if strangely belated farewell to John Lennon.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, book is amazing! It is action packed with so many different things you have to keep reading to find out what is next. It has very descriptive and powerful words that really make you think about what you are reading. I like it when authors put a lot of emotion into their books because you can really tell when the author is really into the book like the Hunger Games which makes it very fun to read. One of my favorite things about this book is that the book gets right into the story and doesn't put chapter after chapter of information in the beginning of the book that makes you stop reading the book.  I also love this book because it gives you little hits about things throughout the book which makes you put all the little pieces together to figure out the big game. Marit

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />I finally started to pay closer attention to Bob Dylan's music after seeing the documentary NO DIRECTION HOME on DVD.  I don't know why it took me so long - maybe sometimes a person just needs the right guide, especially when they're traveling in a world as rich and complex as Bob Dylan's (thank you Martin Scorsese).  And now here comes TEMPEST, the first proper studio album since I officially became a Bob Dylan fan - and it was worth waiting for.<br /><br />Opener \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" will inject any room with a little something I like to call \\"Instant Atmosphere.\\"  The gently twanging opening riffs transport the listener back in time to the heyday of western swing king Bob Wills, but when the band kicks it up a notch at the forty-two second mark, it isn't long before this chugging old-timey train song takes on a weird intensity all its own - check out the official video appearing on sites like Amazon and You Tube and see what kind of strangely romantic and violent images this song begat in at least one director's mind.<br /><br />\\"Soon After Midnight\\"  sounds like a fifties-style slow-dance swooner that might even get my fiercely anti-Dylan wife to sway around the room with me, while still delivering Dylanesque delights like \\"I`m searchin` for phrases, to sing your praises,\\" which contrasts amusingly with a triple headed rhymer like \\"Charlotte's a harlot, dresses in scarlet.\\"<br /><br />\\"Narrow Way\\" employs a searing, broken-record style blues riff for over seven minutes while Dylan growls his way through a winding tale of apocalyptic anxiety and violence, punctuated by the memorable refrain \\"if I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me some day.\\"<br /><br />And it just gets better from there.<br /><br />Many casual and new Dylan listeners might find the first half of the album to be the most user-friendly, while tracks 6-10 contain the more challenging (and more violent) offerings, including the fourteen minute, forty-five verse title track as well as a tribute to the late John Lennon.  But this is all worthwhile stuff delivered with a brilliant confidence and DIY flair appropriate to one of the most important and influential figures in the history of recorded music.  The fans and the critics will get this album and will have plenty to say about it, but to the Bob Dylan fence sitters I'd like to quote Joan Baez in NO DIRECTON HOME:<br /><br />\\"There are no veils, curtains, doors, walls, anything between what pours out of Bob's hand onto the page and what is somehow available to the core of people who are believers in him.  \\"There's some people who'd say... you know, not interested.  But if you're interested, he goes way, way deep.\\"<br /><br />Hopefully this outstanding new album will find many of those who are interested...but just don't know it yet.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listenere, forty-five verse title track as well as a tribute to the late John Lennon.

B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|Citizen Kane although dated is still one of the best films ever and the blue ray release demands that it be part of your personal collection.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I don't generally wrote reviews on games, but this one deserves it. Although I agree with others, there needs to be more levels, but I am sure those will come with an update. You can play this and have a blast without spending a dime of real money, although that option is there if ur impatient.
1423136802|3.0|This is not one of those heavy duty cardboard 'boxes' with the set of books.  This is a flimsier folded, light almost cardstock box with a fold-in flap on the back side.  The books are fine - rather nice 'gold' lettering on the spines - and the binding is comparable to what you see on any paperback these days.  No, that's not saying a lot, but they're average. :)<br />I admit that I was hoping for a better box - this one is going to have trouble standing the test of time - but it 'looks' good and if you're really just after the books then you will have no problems.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The graphics are good and the game is just fast enough to keep me interested. Visiting other towns and performing tasks for friends makes the game more interesting because you get a chance to see what your neighbors have accomplished.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|I had heard that Homeland was just as good as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and other top-tier shows.<br /><br />Sadly, it's not even in the same ballpark.<br /><br />A passable show? Sure. But several things prohibit it from being in the same class as those mentioned above. First up, the obvious: Does anyone believe that Claire Danes (an &uuml;ber-talented actress) was cast correctly? I don't buy her for a minute here. A petite and attractive blonde CIA agent? I have a hard time on this one.<br /><br />Next, things are just too convenient. I can see plot twists coming a mile away and there seemed to be the need to resolve everything within a few episodes.<br /><br />Had this show been hyped less, I would have enjoyed it more.

B0053TWV46|5.0|Creepshow 2 is a perfect example of an 80's anthology horror film. A little cheesy, very gory and simple but entertaining stories. While not as good as the original Creepshow, it is still a good horror film. The only low point in the movie is the third story, which I at least think is a good ten minutes too long. But, if you liked the original you will like Creepshow 2.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|One of the compaints crirics had about this film was that the action sequences were too fast-paced so that it was sometimes hard to keep up.  Well, its not often the viewer can correct defects in the theatrical release. But with the ff and stop-action buttons, those things that raced heedlessly across the screen now obey your will.  Another compaint was that the movie was by the numbers and held no surprises.  But I was surprised several times. One surprise was Ryan Reynolds.  He sank into this role with a gritty bearing far, far outside the comic domain.  Actors in these kind of roles sometimes seem to be on automatic, which can work, but with Reynolds you can always see the wheels turning--a subtle but significant difference.  Denzel was good too, of course, but it is Reynolds you will remember.  The ending, laced with reflective overtones, was especially well-done.

Having never seen a message like that before, I attempted to play it in my blu-ray player. This time I got a \\"region error\\" message. We then tried one more dvd player only to receive the same message. At this point, my only conclusion is that the problem is with the dvd itself. Like I said, very disappointing.

B007SGM084|5.0|This was the first book (set of books) I purchased for my new kindle.  I read the 3rd book on loan from my local library and had to find out what happened \\"before.\\"  Wow -- a lot happened.  I've read parts of the books to my husband on a long road trip -- he too was sucked into Christian and Ana's world.  It is primarily a love story with baggage from the past and the rescue of one very lost soul and the discovery of inner strengths for another.  I highly recommend it -- but only if you have enough time to read without pausing.  I recommend setting a timer so you can get out of the chair or lounge and walk around -- you can find yourself forgetting to go to bed, or feed the cat, or go to work.  Yeah, I was in so deep, time kinda stood still.  It's that good.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|The good: I can read my Kindle books and periodicals on my Nexus 7 tablet. I really like that I can set the background for black with a white font. It's so much easier on the eyes! Whispersync is nice when it works, but it has wonky moments.<br />The bad: Books determine many settings. Some books render with VERY wide margins (1/4 of the page on each side) and the app settings don't help. Even books that render better still leave more white space than my Kindles do. Books also control the fonts and background colors. Giving us choices would improve the experience. (Black font on black screen = blank page.) We need folders to organize our collections, preferably ones we can sync with other Kindles. Highlighting needs fixed so readers can see the text they have highlighted. And a page turn graphic would be SO nice. Are you listening, Amazon?<br />It would make more sense if Amazon let users purchase books from within the app instead of sending us to a browser. They are in the business of selling books, right?<br />People should remember that Amazon is very good about customer service, so if you have a book that won't work in this app, you CAN return it. Contact them!

B00846REIS|4.0|This book was worth reading, seemed a little short. I was surprised that it did not take long to get to the end and now I have to wait for the next release to come out in less than a month. I would have liked to start the next book sooner, that is why I did not rate as 5 stars. This book does seem a lot like 50 Shades of Grey with a few changes. Looking forward to the next release soon.

0061122416|2.0|Paulo Coelho \\"The Alchemist\\" is a far-fetched confusing book with good meanings but lack of clarity. Coelho doesn't come right up and tell us what he is trying to get across. Instead he subtly weaves in deeper meanings between the lines. For example if you look closely throughout the book you can interpret that he is trying to tell us that the journey is better than the end result. This is clearly a powerful message that many can take to heart. These characteristics make for a good book, although Coelho ruins the good parts with the bad. Even though he blended the realistic and unrealistic events it was a smidge too much a lot. It was distracting and took away from the story as a whole. The story is very enhanced; especially when he actually has a conversation with the winds, desert, and heavens. This is obviously not possible but it adds to the spiritual side of the story, as does the Soul of the World concept.<br /><br />Coelho has good ideas but he doesn't portray them very well. He left characters undeveloped, idea unfinished, and went overboard sometimes. These are the negative aspects of his story. He had too many biblical allusions, spiritual ideas, and religious thoughts. It was distracting and instead of enhancing the story it just overpowered the main idea. He also lacked clarity, more than once you will ask yourself \\"What is he talking about?\\". He mixes in many religions and religious beliefs, which can help more people connect to the story, or it can be confusing and pointless, depends on your view. The ending of the book is abrupt, as though he didn't have time to finish it. It essentially helps demonstrate the main idea yet also ruins the whole book. Coelho isn't a bad writer he just has too much at once, he has the good ideas now all he needs is to develop them more and craft a book, not a fairytale.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You must get this app. Daily readings, many versions available and you listen to the spoken word while or exercising. Awesome!
B004E2XAFW|4.0|Great music and videos, from a band I wasn't aware of. The DVD with short videos was great.  I hope there is a full length movie available with the story line. I'll be purchasing more of their music, and hope the music/movie theme has some growth potential.
B008M36ER0|5.0|My husband and I were a little hesitant because we had never heard of this movie but we enjoyed it!
0307279189|4.0|I run about three miles every other day and I enjoyed reading about the hardships of running, the marketing of running shoes, the human body, all of it.  The story was incredible and extremely powerful to think that all human beings are programmed to run and each person has the ability to do it.  I think about the pointers to make me a better runner and I'm trying to apply them to my routine.  I think everyone should take the time to read this because we all get so consumed with working and money we don't take the time to take care of ourselves.  The Tarahumara Indians possess a way of life that we have forgotten which includes, living, having fun, team work and enjoying life without the pressures of gaining material possessions.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I was deeply troubled but acutely fascinated by Ms. Flynn's characters in Sharp Objects: A Novel.  I found it to be a true page turner but not because I was enjoying the oppressive, sad lives of these human beings but rather because I wanted to know more about these people and how they might have come to be so twisted.  I won't share plot lines as I'm sure other reviewers have in more detail.  I will share however, the impact the storyline has on the reader as you follow along with the main character, Camille as she is assigned to write up an in-depth report of two shocking murders that occurred in her hometown; the place that she left behind long ago, to work through the demons that she has carried with her to this day. It's an intriguing read.  Keep an open mind.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|i wish that there was more notebook covers and i really hope you work on making it more simple so i can jot things down faster
B008A1NSTG|3.0|Was a good movie plot and had a lot of good ideas and plot twists in it. However, it was filled with so much anti-Republican-politics and anti-Reaganism that the other parts of the movie got drowned out by the screaming rhetoric, regardless of your party affiliation or which side your political views fell on. They could have very easily played up certain parts of the movie that were of real interest and played down the trumpet section a little and had a much better movie.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This is the best series on tv or should I say was. I started watching this when I was a kid I'm now 23! This boxset is amazing there's been rumors that the DVDs get scratched when you pull them out and I can say that's not true at all..very heavy duty construction on the set and that's what makes it worth the money!! Enjoy this cause I am I'm on season 8 right now..
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I also have this on my phone.  Why can't I buy colors on the Kindle Fire version????  Otherwise, I really like the game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the format and easy viewing selection but every once in awhile it will not load and I have to close and re-open.  Otherwise I live it!!
B0025X4OYI|5.0|\\"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\\" (taking vol. 1 & 2 as a set) is one of the most influential and ground-breaking albums since Elvis.  He broke down the walls between R & B, Rock, and Country, and made it clear that music was music and the labels were no longer important.  It's now an everyday thing to see important musicians from one genre take his/her influences into another with good results, or people from different genres get together and make something new out of the mix.  (\\"Rising Sand\\", anyone?)  Rock singers do duets with Tony Bennett, and Lionel Richie does Country.  Paul McCartney does songs from the 1940's.  But it all started with Ray Charles.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic. Along with many other people, I had great expectations when I first began the story and I'm glad to say that Raven's Shadow exceeded them all, by far. I can't wait for the second book to come out.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|The matter that makes up Dylan's 35th outing is dark and complex; beginning in 1997 (Time out of Mind), this is possibly his final creative outburst - and what a trip it's been!  History will compare such incredible body of work with the likes of Cohen and Tagore, in terms of holding on an edge, desire (and sanity) until latter years of one's mortal life.<br /><br />Tempest is Dylan's 5th masterpiece in a row - perhaps one that will win most 10/10s in critical reviews  since 2001's Love and Theft (incidentally that was also released on Sep 11); the final years now likely rivals his most prolific period between 1963 and 1966 spanning six albums. Six sheer classics and more have been written on them than you'd have time to read.<br /><br />That's past; a foundation of popular culture. Let's talk about the present here.<br /><br />This is an album of our times - a portrait of  decline, a reflection of decadence, in society, in families and life in general; this is part and parcel of our cultural landscape that looks more & more like a vacant parking lot, sky full of fire and pain pouring down - not my words here - livelihoods bust, businesses bankrupt and enough bullets in supply to eradicate the entire human race; rich  getting richer and poor gets poorer, `grinding penury and exceeding luxury\\" side by side - on and off Wall Street. \\"I will pay in blood but not my own' he says, and means every word of it.<br /><br />I moved to the west in early nineties; few years later, the unplugged  sessions came out and I thought that would be his last album; revisiting that recording, I now sense a sense of restlessness - a desire to stand up and sing ...<br /><br />Tempest is like an epilogue to 'Not Dark Yet', not musically, rather thematically; it's dark now - he knows that; and he wraps every word of this album in that darkness; mind you this is a dark album, not brooding or melancholic. Light flickers, occasionally, like in the intro of Duquesne Whistle - elsewhere, that light is not abundant. This is as far away as Dylan can be from Modern Times - standing up and singing close to the microphone - sometimes in an angry growl, sometimes a murmur or a prayer.<br /><br />The backing band swings with force of a gale; better than The Band, and gets a same respectful nod from this writer as to the man himself; listening to the album, I get the vision of a flock of seagulls flying in unison, like multiple sound waves traveling together but distinctly separate in character from each other.<br /><br />The recording is clear, dense and spontaneous - far from the atrocious digital quality you get these days  - almost sounds like an analog recording-  like the best of the Hi Fi when, say, Highway 61 got released (just keep wishing there was a monaural version available!)  This is not an album that one should listen to on a headphone or in mp3 - you need a player, a physical disc and couple of speakers. Then sit tight - I promise its gonna be a great ride!<br /><br />The first five or six reviews that I read on the Amazon US website are excellent, with deep insights - written with care and will form valuable guidance to appreciative readers for years to come. In addition, both UNCUT and Mojo reviews are works of art in itself.<br /><br />Musically, this is perhaps Dylan's best effort since Oh Mercy. That was mostly Daniel Lanois creating a mystical dreamy landscape - this time its Jack Fate at the wheels - bringing out the best in every member in his gifted band and every word that Dylan has written for this album. The timing, the nuance, the utter simplicity & effortless delivery - all remain superb and reminiscent of a man in his prime. In my opinion this album will reveal much more in terms of meaning, music and depth over time, over repeated listening - something I have found with Blonde on Blonde and John Wesley Harding, among others - they still talk to me like never before.<br /><br />Dylan's singing is in perfect pitch that is best suited for his own writings; these songs are not rushed (like I felt, in parts, for Together Through Life) - they are impeccably constructed with absolutely no fluff or excess. These are songs only he can sing - and his voice, the angry growl and loving whisper remains as unrepeated in the past as this album in its entirety.<br /><br />The skies are dark, the air is dirty, families, people, races and religions are all disconnected. Perfect! What better time to give Tempest another spin!<br /><br />Thank you again, Señor!
B008TRUDAS|1.0|The writing was unimaginative, unsophisticated and poorly edited. I know this is a self published novel (understandably) but I see absolutely no reason why it would have any 5 star reviews, two at best.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Harry Bosch fans will love this one.  Although not a recent publication, if you haven't read it before, its a good one.  Well worth the download to my Kindle.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|I read many of the reviews and was on the fence. I feared that it would break right away. My son has just turned 4 years old and seems to figure out a way to break things that I never thought possible, in ways that I could not have dreamed. Like the title of this review states states, the truck is impressive in size and his eyes lit up when he saw it. I sat down and showed him how it was \\"meant\\" to work and explained that if the mechanisms stick then he should not force them, but instead to turn the mechanism in the opposite direction or it could break and I would most likely not be able to fix it. I was with him when he turned the scooping mechanism a bit too hard and I heard the click of the gears skipping. Nothing broke but it definitely skipped a tooth or two. If this was not an intentional fail-safe on the toy builders part maybe it should be. I think that the \\"be careful\\" explanation and the fact that he is now four years old and enjoys the scooping part of it so much, that his interest in taking care of it has set in. He has played with it everyday since he received it and now tells me how it should work and that I should not force the knobs if they get stuck. So I give a strong two thumbs up to Bruder.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is such a fun way to waste time! The app was worth the wait! My sister got so tired of hearing &quot;yeah, I saw that on Pinterest&quot; that she had to get a board.
0345803485|2.0|Love these reviews.  As for that book, no way could I ever read that.<br /><br />Unless it's in front of a crowd, I'm well stocked on White Russians and feeling puckish.<br /><br />And blushing, flushing, gasping, murmuring, while some guy's mouth presses into a hard line and he<br /><br />\\"touches me down there\\" again and again and again.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie was far beyond my expectations, I was so surprised and I really like it and thought it was a fabulous movie.  WATCH IT!!
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|I listened to this once and felt as Aaron does... Then I gave it another 2,3,4 listens to... Amazing is what I characterize this album to be... Absolutely paralyzingly... The subtlety of this guy is genius, the musicianship is top notch, the 2 covers are dazzling... If you love the Crowes as I do, and loved Big Moon Ritual, which I also give 5 stars, you will not be disappointed.... Give it a few listens to... This album perked me up big time...
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Overall it was enjoyable to watch knowing we were watching a dark tale.  I thought the imagery surrounding the wicked Queen Ravenna was done well (her whole look gets darker as the movie progresses) and some of the effects were interesting, such as the mirror and when she transformed back into human form from her ravens.  I felt there were several areas the story didn't explain too well, like when Snow White asked the Huntsman to escort her to the Duke.  It took me awhile to actually figure out who that was supposed to be (and why was he so far away?).  I mean, I knew William and his father got away, but I didn't know he was the Duke.  Hubby thought William was her brother initially.... And as beautiful as the animal gathering scene was in the sanctuary, it was not well explained either.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, but I lacked closure at the end of the movie!  I have no idea if Snow White knew who's kiss woke her up or which guy she chooses (she has to pick one, right?!).  The visual aspect was great but the story and characters could have been built up more.  It was probably the first time I didn't really feel connected to Snow White.  I didn't feel strongly when she was poisoned.  Really the only character I came to care about was the Hunstman!  The movie lacked the depth and character development I prefer, but it was still enjoyable to watch.  I still need to see the extended version - maybe I will like that better?<br /><br />*I received a copy of the bluray combo pack to review.
1401322786|4.0|This beautiful book has a message for each reader if we take the time, no pun intended, to listen. A smile of a book.....thank you
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest so much! Usually works smoothly, depending on my wifi connection and hardly ever force closes on my Kindle Fire.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The latest update is great on EVO,  the only thing i dont like is theres no dedicated button for exclamation or question mark. You have to long press on the small keyboard, other than that the update is great!
B008XFAT7S|5.0|It seems that the people behind this movie said \\"You know all those movies that claim to be non-stop action, but really aren't? Let's actually do a non-stop action movie!\\". In a 101 minute movie, there is perhaps 20 minutes where there is no action: 5 minutes to set up the movie, 5 minutes to wrap up the movie, and 10 minutes sprinkled here and there to let you catch your breath before the next action sequence.<br /><br />If you are looking for complex plot or deep character development, look elsewhere. If you hunger for a visual feast of fists flying, then this will fill you up and leave you needing to undo your belt.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|While I am both a Metallica fan and very much a Lou Reed fan, the reviews of this album are quite polar on this single topic.  Lou Reed fans will find this to be the entertaining release that he is known for.  Metallica fans, well, maybe you just ought to go on your merry way or read the rest of the reviews first and see if you are Lou Reed compatible.<br /><br />I for one own pretty much everything that both sides have to offer... and will say that anything new from Lou takes some getting used to due to his unique writing and vocal style.  In this case, since I love the musical/instrumental contributions from Metallica, this will no doubt take me next to no time at all to get fully into.<br /><br />Is it a 5 star for Lou?  No... sorry Lou, I still find your earlier works to have a sharper edge to them (musically as compositions, and lyrically as the marvelous story teller that you are).  Highlighted by my all time favorite albums \\"New York\\" and \\"Magic & Loss\\".<br /><br />As for Metallica, they lost their draw on me back in the Load/Reload days... but it was fun to hear them thrashing out some speed metal riffs with Lou.
B006VSP906|5.0|Fantastic collection a must-read for Hitchens fans. His writing was like none other. I will greatly miss him. Get it today or search Vanity Fair.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I tried the game out of curiosity, and have highly enjoyed it. It is a good mix of simple concepts tied together to make challenging puzzles
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow is a great game to get ur mind thinking and I would recommend this app to anyone plz play this app.!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is the best weather app I ever got. I use it every day. very easy to use and extremely accurate!!!! after a week of downloading it I just deleted all the other apps.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This is an essential movie for anyone who is concerned about what they eat and where it comes from. You will be extremely surprised at what you will learn.
B000286S8S|4.0|David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar ?<br /><br />Like chocolate or vanilla---that is a question that will confront rock and rollers for generations to come!<br /><br />Van Halen is a fantastic rock and roll band.<br /><br />They are also like a cat with nine lives.<br /><br />No single front man can make or break this band.<br /><br />David Lee Roth-- he is on this CD.<br /><br />Sammy too.<br /><br />It truly is the best of both worlds.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This was entertaining and not condescending.  All roles were well conceived and provided enough context for the non-fan to understand what was going on.  Watched this on a plane.
1596354208|5.0|this book has 11 designs of various levels of competence.  the designs are easy to read and work up quickly.  many of the projects can be worked on needle tatting, which is a plus, because there are very few jewelry tatting patterns available.  the photos of the project in progress are very helpful. i enjoyed the book  and made several items.  i hope that there will be more of this series printed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I decided to buy workout dvds to really tone myself and be healthier. I bought this dvd along with 3 other biggest loser workouts. I figured I would do the 30 day shred first.  I've only been doing this dvd for 3 days and I've noticed a HUGE diference in myself. The first day I couldn't get past 6 minutes! I had to take a 5 minute break before I could finish it. Today I still hate the push-ups, but I can do them easier than before. I feel like I won't be able to move up to level 2 for a couple weeks. So far, I don't know if I've lost body fat, but I feel a lot stronger and happier about myself in many ways. I don't even care if the thing says \\"30 days\\", I just want to be fit!
B005DZMODI|5.0|I have purchased 2 copys. One is kept in our house. It is a CD and DVD, The other is a CD which is in my truck. It is being played all the time. I know it by heart and love it more each time I listen. I hear something new each time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I am enjoying making a settlement.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys being in the wild..
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|It's a new take by Linkin Park, but I'm not let down.  Some people complain about it not being Hybrid Theory or Meteora.  But, if you want to listen to either of these, then listen to them.  If you want to listen to something new, where they tried new things, and produced a good album, listen to this.
B008EQIA7W|5.0|Way Better than Clash of the Titans. Quality of the film was excellent. I would definitely recommend others to rent it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoyed the original free puzzles.  I tried to purchase more, but download fails.  I then uninstalled and reinstalled to try again with the same results and the latest install had fewer pieces for the master level.  I have no problem getting the free jigsaw puzzles and have hardly any failures.  Great four passing the time with no costs since it does not allow for paid downloads.  At least I wrote to cancel, hopefully they will honor the request.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I never saw Season 2 on PBS so I had nothing to compare the episode lengths. But I was dissapointed that this DVD has no Bonus Material. I would have loved a more indepth explanation, and a review of costumes, which I love in Period pieces. IMHO S2 wasn't as exciting as S1 and the military scenes bored me. I think I may have to rewatch it as I stayed up all night to view the entire season!!!
B002APU580|5.0|The story itself is amazing, and then you add in the music and cinematography - incredible.  I have watched this movie at least a dozen times, and fall in love with it again every time!
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I so wanted to like this book. I had read all the reviews and my daughter told me how much she liked it. After the first chapter, I wanted to pull my hair out. I knew that the author had written the book as if it was a story being told by a 5 year old boy. I found some of the language a little over the top for a 5 year old. How many 5 year old boys call their bedspread a \\"duvet\\". I realize that his mother was his only teacher and therefore her words were his words. But I find it hard for a 19 year old girl to call it a duvet either. The repetition was excrutiating. The breast feeding was mentioned way too much. I have to commend the mother for continuing that practice for the nutritional value to Jack. I would have liked to have known more about the kidnapper, the trial and the mother's family background. But since it was being told by a 5 year old, it was a bit empty for me. After the first half of the book, I was confused as I thought that would be the end. But another half of a book inside \\"Room\\" would have been too much. So the last half is devoted to Jack's being introduced to \\"Outside\\" and how strange things are to him. The ending was nothing special and could have been so much more with the upcoming trial.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|I DON'T WATCH A LOT OF SHOWS,BUT SUPERNATURAL IS ONE OF THE BEST. CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON SEVEN, HOPE IT HAS A LONG RUN.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I bought the book because of all the media hype.  It was definitely a page turner.  Read it cover to cover in about two days.  The ending makes you buy the rest of the trilogy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome book! Like War of the Roses gone mad! The start is slow ,but picks up fast. Needs a sequel!!!Read it in one day,I could not put it down.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Did not work out of the box.  Would be nice if had been tested before packaging to ensure it worked.
B0091574VI|5.0|I appreciate the film makers diligence in creating this visually stunning story. Nature is beautiful and just as brutal. My only disappointment was that it was longer. I was happy to see Oscar was in good hands. Excellent job.
1612183956|2.0|I finished it, and then I said, \\"What the heck did I just read?\\"<br /><br />I was intrigued by the author's comments about being influenced by Twin Peaks, as I too was a big fan of that show.  But if you're looking for something similar to that, look elsewhere, because the only similarity is the town where things are somewhat...strange.<br /><br />Others have recapped the plot, so I won't bore you with that, but I do have a few things to say.  The chase scenes are extremely long and tiresome--I found myself skipping ahead because I don't need to know about every single step this guy takes.  And while there's a decent \\"message\\" at the end, it isn't enough to reward the reader for following Ethan Burke through so many torturous scenes (and torture there is--let this be a warning to squeamish readers, the violence is intense, graphic, and happens  so often that I began to think, really?  He's getting the snot beat out of him AGAIN?!)  Several threads were left dangling.  And speaking of dangling:  was it really necessary for Ethan to be running around naked so often?  Mr Crouch--gratuitous nudity is only good in a visual format.  I didn't want to picture this poor guy running down a street in the middle of the night, stark naked.  Why that was that necessary?  Scene after scene...oops, I have to take my shirt off because it smells.  Oops, my t-shirt is smelly too.  Guess I have to leave my pants on till the next scene.  Oh no, I don't have time to get dressed!  I'm going to rush out in a hospital johnny!  Oh no, it's torn off me and I'm naked again!  Really, stop it.<br /><br />BUT...it kept me reading.  The writing overall is pretty good, if a bit choppy, but Blake Crouch has a distinctive style that others might really enjoy.  Others have said that it's hard to categorize this story and I agree.  It could be horror, sci-fi, post-apocalyptic, or all of the above.  To sum up, I'm glad I read it, but would not seek out more books from this author.
0345803485|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey, the highly touted SMBD sex trilogy about a virgin who meets her control freak bondage teacher, could have been so much more...such as well written.  However, the writing is juvenile, my friends and I laughed on facebook that many sex scenes just appear to have been copied and pasted into other areas of the entire trilogy, literally word for word, not just in the first book, and look for our heroine to say, \\"Oh my,\\" before each new kink scene.  Counting these may be good on a road trip.<br /><br />Look, I understand if a person gets an idea for a get-rich-quick scheme, and indeed, that is exactly what the author did here.  However, I fail to understand the humongous interest that the reading public seems to have in the Grey books.  Getting a how-to lesson from a sex shop sales person would be a much better education, if you could stand the slime, and you could buy stuff while you were there.<br /><br />Yes, I admit it...I did read all three books.  My story is that I read them because I am a journalist, and I wanted to know what I was talking about before I started to rant.  However, now I am fully qualified to save you the trouble of reading these.  **sigh**  Yes, you're right:  You can just wait for the movie, and rest assured, it will be a blockbuster with major stars.  It will succeed largely, in my estimation, because it will be cut down to approximately 90 minutes.  In other words, many of the repetitious (and not terribly creative) sex scenes and juvenile writing will be reduced, eliminated, or rewritten.  E.L. James will still be financially set for life, no matter what Hollywood does with her pulpy, publicly acceptable, porn trilogy.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Heard this was very popular again and bought it.  Really brought back some good times.  Phil is just great.  I also like No Jacket Required.  If you like Phil you will like this one.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very rich, detailed reports from the zombie apocalipse survivors. Incredibly believable and thrilling. A must-read for those who enjoy H.P. Lovecraft style terror stories.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The Hunger Games was excellent, Catching Fire was ok, this was is disappointing. I guess a trilogy doesn't mean all three books have the same good plot, tension, etc. I would not go for a forth book. But still, the Hunger Games was excellent.
B0012BTBQU|2.0|Don't get me wrong, the book is excellent. I read The Final Empire before previous to ordering it from bordeebook, and it is by far one of my favorites. In the description, this book is listed as Very Good, but the book I received is in very poor condition. The pages are dirty and stained, and the bindings are falling apart.<br />My advice is to buy this book, but to maybe spend a couple dollars on another seller.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I don't like having to wait for energy or having to buy items with bucks. other than that. its okay.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|For anyone that read the book, this movie was enjoyable but not great.  I would have liked to have seen certain things not be changed. (SPOILER ALERT) removing the character of the Mayor and the Mayor's Daughter was in my opinion a mistake.  having the pin come from there and the underlying meaning of the pin were important to me when I read the book and they were overlooked completely in the movie.  Action scenes were quite good and we did enjoy the movie.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I loved the way this watch looked.  As a casual watch,  it looked great.  Problem is it never kept time well.  From the start it had to be reset daily. Now after a couple of years it gains at least 15 minutes a day.  Bummer to get rid of this but it is not worth the hassle of always having to reset and never trusting the time.  Disappointed.
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|Dark Places is a good book Which had me gripped in parts.  I actually finished it in two days as I got really engrossed in it.  The main character is interesting and the story is narrated in parts by this likeable, strange person whose tone is often light and humorous despite the depressing story that she is part of.  Overall it was a good read with lots of suspense built by several alternating perspectives of the same horrible event.
B004IG8WPM|3.0|If you remember this movie from your childhood and are thinking of watching it with your children, like my husband and I did, I hope this helps you... I remembered the adventure and fun of the story but I had forgotten about the language used and sexual innuendo. The Playboy magazine that is referenced and shown throughout the movie, the scene where the tow-truck driver arrives home to find his wife and another man having an affair, the gang scene on the subway in which \\"the F word\\" is used twice. There are many other instances with four-letter words; I won't list them all.<br />It's still a good movie, just not for my nine-year old to watch!<br />As far as the streaming and quality of picture, that was all great -no problem at all. We streamed through our Blu-Ray player and there were no problems.
B008EQIJQO|5.0|My two teenagers were hesitant to watch a silent movie but were quickly hooked (the dog helped).  What a great story about the cycles we experience in life.  Watch this movie.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Title says it all. With better actors the movie could have been good. Nice effects but that was about it.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I spent a probably unnecessary amount of time researching bags before making this purchase.  My primary driver is a briefcase equivalent to carry a laptop, tablet, some accessories and paperwork to work sites along with occasional airplane travel.  I was able to put my hands on the bag at a local retailer and knew it was going to fit my needs well but couldn't pass up the cost savings of purchasing through Amazon.  This bag has a lot to live up to replacing it's predecessor's 10 year run but it appears to be up to the task.  It looks to be very well made and has a great number of pockets to segment and organize the content.  I would definitely suggest to those in search of such an item.
1468014269|1.0|There seem to be a number of people downloading the public domain version of James Murphy's notoriously bad translation and trying to make a quick buck on it. This is one of those times. This edition is obviously from the web. It has the same OCR errors as the web version. The Murphy edition itself is a very poor quality translation as Murphy was not a fluent German speaker and relied heavily on his German dictionary. This fact is clear from the stilted style of the writing and he also uses many incomprehensible words. You need a dictionary to read his translation and even then it is a challenge to understand.<br /><br />I gave this edition one star because it is a copy of a public domain web version so you should not have to pay for it when it is already free and it also got one star for being such a poor quality version.

B008AWBQGW|5.0|As a long time fan of the band I eagerly anticipated this new studio CD.  I had just seen them at Harrah's Philadelphia on 5/12 and they were great.  This new effort is really good did I say really good because it is effing great.  The first three tracks will blow you away.  I can picture the old band playing these songs.  Overall, this is a great CD well worth buying.  I hope to see the band playing some of these tracks in the future.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|I have always had a soft spot for pigs for some reason which just makes this film even better for me. I love everthing about this movie,especially the score. I can't get the song \\"If I Had Words\\" out of my head(not that that is a bad thing-I really,really like the tune. BABE is a film for the entire family and that is a really good thing,to paraphrase Martha Stewart!
B008L1PYQU|5.0|For all the bad reviews you hear about this newly remixed album....Think again! When I was just 7 years old, Destroyer was released and was one of the first albums I can remember spinning!  This vinyl printing of Destroyer brings back all those fun childhood memories rockin' out to Detroit Rock City, Flaming Youth, God of Thunder....etc!!!  Don't think of this album as a desecration of the original recording, think of this as a celebration of your childhood!  We all have the original album from 76' to enjoy, but this new record brings the fun of owning new vinyl back into your home to celebrate the lost art of rocking out to a single album instead of mixing 7000 mp3s on your ipod.  Too many times kids these days download 1000's of songs off the internet without any knowledge of a band's effort of rehearsing and jamming out a stamped-in-time era of 9 or 10 songs. Those songs that helped to shape our innocence of being a teen or young. A lot of these bands like KISS that were released on vinyl in the 70's, the younger mp3 generation really missed out on enjoying an album's art work and didn't get to physically touch a bands album.  This version of Destroyer does NOT erase the original recording, but embraces it!  It comes with the original first printing of the album's Casablanca label on the record, an insert with the KISS Army logos, a full photo of the original album cover, and an excellent history full of facts and photos of Bob Ezrin's Destroyer masterpiece!  From the guy who brought you Pink Floyd's the Wall, how can you go wrong with this?!  The remixed album it self is a great conversation piece to share with your friends and children about how we listened to music in the early days.  Even cassette tape was rare.  Vinyl was our only escape from our parents rules and shaped us who we are today!  So please, celebrate this release and remember how fun music was when you could touch an album rather than put thousands of songs on shuffle on your ipod without any knowledge of a song or the album cover's history!  Enjoy!

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|We watched it together despite her reluctance, but she loved it and said it's now her favorite movie.  She then watched it again the next night and again on our iPad since it had digital copy for iTunes.  I wasn't all caught up like she was, but it gave me a chance to talk about the significance of some of the issues brought up.
0439023513|1.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games very much and Catching Fire was also good.  This book is terrible.  The author appears to have slapped together an outline that did not work, fleshed it out with some drama between the main characters that does nothing to move the story along and then moved the characters through some very unlikely scenes until she could not figure out how to bring it all to conclusion.  At that point deux ex machina - everything is wrapped up while the lead character is in hospital.  I am glad I stopped reading (way too late) and switched to reading a summary.  This is one of the worst books I have ever read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have not had uniterrupted time to read this book so my rating may be low due to my lack of concentration and sleepy state when reading.  That being said, it is a well written book that has kept my interest so far...though not enough to keep me awake wanting to read more.
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom's latest work of fiction opens with an evocative scene. An ancient man, solitary in a cave, listens to the voices of people from Earth begging endlessly for one thing: more time.<br /><br />The precise identity of this man isn't known for some time; instead, the novel introduces readers to two of the people whose voices the man hears. One is teenager Sarah Lemon. She longs for more time to prepare for her first date, with a handsome and seemingly unattainable boy who volunteers at the same homeless shelter with her on the weekends. Ethan is flirtatious but can be aloof, and Sarah can't quite believe that he's interested in her --- awkward Sarah Lemon, with her divorced parents, overachieving grades, and few extra pounds. She wants the night to be perfect, though, and for that she needs more time. But what if Ethan has something else in mind for their time together?<br /><br />Not as much time, though, as Victor Delamonte desires. Victor, a hugely successful and wildly wealthy hedge fund manager, is used to getting everything he wants. So when he discovers that he's dying of cancer, he doesn't believe that he can't just buy his way into immortality. Soon, though, he discovers cryonics and hatches an elaborate plan to extend his life decades or centuries into the future. As he grasps for a miracle, he finds himself growing farther and farther away from his once-beloved wife. Isn't his remaining time with her worth just as much as some nebulous quest for eternal life?<br /><br />And what about that mysterious, ancient man, forced to listen to the stories of Sarah, Victor, and millions of others just like them? It turns out that he's the one who first sparked humans' peculiar fixation with time. Dor, who lived near the time of the building of the Tower of Babel, was the first man to conceptualize the passing --- and the measurement --- of time. He invented the first clock, and from then on, Albom's book suggests, humans never stopped fretting about time passing too slowly or, more often, too quickly. Although Dor gained a sort of cursed immortality, it was at the price of everything he held most dear. Now he mourns his losses, sitting in that cave, alone but for the voices that surround him, which are their own form of punishment: \\"to hear every plea from every soul who desired more of the thing he had first identified, the thing that moved man further from the simple light of existence and deeper into the darkness of his own obsessions.\\"<br /><br />The ways in which these three main characters become connected to one another are largely metaphysical, as is the ultimate scope of Albom's project. Their very different stories, although varying in their thematic and emotional heft, nevertheless all build suspensefully thanks to his technique of interspersing them, revealing each one by bits and pieces.<br /><br />THE TIME KEEPER is a fable of sorts; although readers likely won't feel preached at, they also should come prepared for a story that weaves together religion, philosophy and common sense in a way that results in a very defined message or even moral. The moral, which comes to all three characters in different ways, is certainly one that busy modern readers will be able to get behind. He also adopts a simplified, pared-down prose style to tell his story, making it read --- despite its contemporary setting and relevance --- even more like classic fables that readers may remember from childhood.<br /><br />Albom has gained a well-deserved reputation for writing about matters of faith, mortality and the afterlife in ways that resonate with readers. In THE TIME KEEPER, he does the same thing in a story that also reminds people how to try to live each day.<br /><br />Reviewed by Norah Piehl

0525953728|5.0|\\"Mark Owen\\" and Kevin Maurer did a fine job on this book. The detail and explanation of events leading up to and during the Bin Laden raid were great! I have served in Iraq and much of what Owen said reminded me of my deployment. Like the chow hall and using empty water bottles for a latrine... This book is a great account of some missions most of us are aware of and some we aren't. From the first page to the last, it's nearly impossible to lay the book down. I highly recommend this book. I can't say anything negative about it. Buy it!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I have read all Kathy Reichs books and must say I was quite disappointed in this Temperance Brennan novel.  The storyline was interesting but too much detail about the diamond mining, the forensic procedures, the Native American history, etc and not enough story.  I think there was more filler than story in the book.  I'm not sure everyone would agree, but I always look forward to Kathy's book and not sure it was worth the money.
B005L12SB2|5.0|Kansas has been a favorite listen since 1975 when a friend turned me on to 'Masque'. It was my first taste of good progressive rock-emphasis on rock. I've had all of this material in the various formats since the 70's. It was great to get it in one small box package. The price was almost umbelievable, at less than 1/5 the individual disc purchase. The remasters sound great. For casual fans, only familiar with the radio friendly Kansas, you owe it to yourself to get this package and hear the power-progressive music that blew away many teenagers nearly 40 years ago.
0525478817|5.0|Loved this book! It is witty, funny, emotional and very well written. I totally fell in love with Hazel and Augustus and I was rooting for them until the very end. The story stirred up alot of emotion inside of me. I found myself thinking about them as I drifted off to sleep and also as a first thought when I woke up. A wonderful love story with adorable characters! Highly recommend reading this!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The author takes you into a different world where witches, vampires and deamons exist amongst us. I thought it was interesting and I really enjoyed this book.  There were times I could not put it down.  In some parts it did seem to drag on a little with too many details, and the ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered (likely because a second book is on the way) but overall a great read.

This a great classic cookbook for you to have in your kitchen.
1439153663|5.0|Excellent book.  A page turner.  Describes so well the conditions of slavery in the late 1700's and early 1800's.  Makes one feel that they are right there in the moment experiencing what the characters experience.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B00005214X|5.0|When the Beatles broke up, each artist went his separate way. George, being who he was, created an album that just rocked! I had the original on vinyl just after its release. I've now got this set on CD along with notes by George commemorating the 30th anniversary of the album's release. For those who love the Beatles as a group and as individual artists, you need to get this album. as a bonus, you get extra songs not released with the original

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was all hype and no delivery! Older man, younger woman, he spanks her while she complains about it.  Seriously? And the writing was so childish that I felt I was getting dumber reading it.  If you want something really fetish and well written then get a classic [[ASIN:0452281423 The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]] which is spectacularly well written and sexually challenging.  Or for a quick more modern and quicker read get [[ASIN:B005ESFMM4 Cherish Desire Singles: Mornings In Grey]] which is sexy and sassy and delicious.  I'm skipping anything else by E.L. James.  Just terrible stuff.

As I already wrote in Hot Press, \\"Breathtaking, mythmaking, heartbreaking, the songs and ballads of Bob Dylan's Tempest are composed of intricately patterned rhyme and sound. No other songwriter can marry words and music as richly as Dylan can, and the perfect-ten tracks of this record come straight to us from a bard's ear and a poet's pen.\\"

B008BDZOZY|4.0|I'm tired of the bland musical product that oozes through corporate pipelines. There's a deadening sameness about the fuzzy guitars and humdrum drumming and affectless vocals of contemporary pop. In this environment, the deliberate creation of an unusual album feels like a gust of fresh air.<br /><br />David Byrne of Talking Heads fame has teamed up with another brilliant nonconformist, St. Vincent (Annie Clark, formerly of Polyphonic Spree), to write and record songs set to danceable electronic beats by John Congleton. They are accompanied by the complex, swooping, angular orchestrations of a very funky horn section. Both artists sing lyrics of ambiguity and anomie that recall some of their intriguing solo performances, but &#34;Love This Giant&#34; doesn't rehash their previous work. It's is a one-of-a-kind hybrid, and I like it a lot.<br /><br />Byrne and Clark open with the first single, &#34;Who,&#34; a very propulsive, rhythmic track on which they duet, but then they start alternating lead vocals. Clark sings the even-numbered and Byrne the odd-numbered songs until they reach &#34;Lazarus,&#34; when they duet again. Clark takes over for the next two tracks, while the final two belong to Byrne.<br /><br />The album has an arc to it, beginning with high-energy music -- jumpy and jagged on the first three cuts (I especially enjoy &#34;Weekend in the Dust&#34;) -- then dialing back the energy somewhat for three songs whose dreamy intros bring to mind minimalist composers like John Adams, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich, particularly on &#34;I Am an Ape.&#34; With &#34;I Should Watch TV,&#34; they leap back for a couple of tracks into the jangly, dissonant sounds that opened the album. When Clark performs &#34;Optimist&#34; and &#34;Lightning&#34; (another favorite of mine), a cool, pensive atmosphere prevails. The penultimate song, &#34;The One Who Broke Your Heart,&#34; has a cheerful, lively tone that blends the music of two more collaborators: the soulful Dap-Kings and the Afro-beat band Antibalas. The last track, &#34;Outside of Space & Time,&#34; is simply a gorgeous love song.<br /><br />There's a lot happening on this recording. It's often sharp and chaotic, yet occasionally smooth and calm, so it really calls for careful, conscious listening. I've heard it all the way through three times now, finding my interest renewed each time. I'm sure to listen several times more to absorb what's going on, which makes this release a clear &#34;buy&#34; for me.<br /><br />A 37-minute live concert of songs from this album is available free online at NPR, together with eight additional minutes of rehearsal footage and insights about the creative process. Filmed at Strathmore Music Center in Rockville, Maryland, it's a must-watch to appreciate the unity of vision with which David Byrne and Annie Clark approach their music and art. The eight-piece brass band is integrated into their choreography, Annie is a badass on guitar, and we get to hear two songs not on the album, St. Vincent's &#34;Marrow&#34; and Talking Heads' &#34;Burning Down the House,&#34; in entirely new settings.balas.

B002BRRTUO|4.0|I grew up watching flash gordon, although i am only thirty i still appreciated the film when i was a child and i must say it had an affect on my little mind.  The film on blu ray is really good, to my surprise.  Sound, and visual quality for such an old film is fantastic.

0553801473|5.0|This series of books is simply amazing. Like nothing I have ever read before. I cant put the books down but I also want to throw it across the room every other chapter because what happens in them make me so mad. Only a great authour could create something that stirs such a reaction in his readers. If you are looking for the \\"good guy wins the day\\" style book, then you need to look elsewhere. Martin creates characters that are evil, who do good things, that you cant help but like, and good characters who are not always as heroic as youd be used to. Nothing in these books is cut and dry and there are so many characters, that the complexity of the story is quite fantastic. Epic. These books are an assault on the mind because we are used to reading fairy tales with happy endings. Martin has thrown us into the real world where things are never black and white, but massive shades of grey. This book is what life would really be like. The good, the bad, and the very ugly. Whether or not we choose to accept it.
B007SSEU9O|2.0|The movie focused heavily on her dementia in later life and only outlined the challenges she faced as Prime Minister. Her time as PM was filled with dramatic events that could have made the movie compelling and yet they only outlined a few of them and hardly ever showed how she responded to those events. It felt like they were trying to marginalize her time as PM, and I never felt invested in the movie.

B007PP2J9I|5.0|First, I must admit my bias. I've been a fan of Mark's technical work at Sysinternals for over 10 years. Mark and I speak at some of the same conferences and I've had the pleasure of talking to him a few times. I went into this book expecting to like it.<br /><br />I enjoyed Mark's previous fiction books Zero Day and Operation Desolation, and Trojan Horse did not disappoint. It follows the same protagonist, Jeff Aiken, as he's drawn into another computer security related adventure. As a professional computer nerd I enjoy the technical correctness of the issues the characters face. In many books and movies it easy for me to get distracted by technical inaccuracies. Not only is the book technically accurate, it also incorporates real life computer security issues, like Stuxnet and power grid vulnerabilities. It was very easy to immerse myself into the story. It also, in a very subtle way, was educational about computer security and what's at stake.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that it was over too soon. That might be my fault as much as Mark's. I spent an awful lot of time reading it once I got started. :)<br /><br />If you like other thrillers like the Dan Brown books, then you'll like this as well.<br /><br />tk

Increased strength, speed and any other improvement he was able to achieve came through training from top coaches and measurements from expensive tools.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw this when it came out and wasnt impressed. Now 10 years later i have the DVD and have watched it about 8 times! Its the kind of movie that grows on you. Plot is simple but the relationship between the leads draws you in and you feel as if you are there with them in Japan. Got a documentary feel sometimes. The love story is so subtle but Murray nails it and the chemistry between these 2 is what makes the movie a winner. Casting by Sofia Copolla shows her insight. The cinematography and music sells it and the fact it was all shot on location in Japan. The original script looks bare( I took a look at it) but Murrays take on it took it to another level! I think Murray deserved more credit!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I had heard a lot about this series of books.  I refrained from reading them until very late because of the reviews I read in my Amazon Kindle review.  After attending a course and a a lecturer oommenting about these books, I decided to download the first book and have a look at what everyone had been talking about.  I found myself absolutely enthralled with the first book \\"Shades of Grey\\".  The sex descriptions were daring and interesting. even though the read was very \\"Mills and Boon\\" (which I usually detest).<br /><br />At the second book I started to skip the sex scenes as I started to find them very monotenous.  Luckily I am a speed reader!  When I became bored I just skipped.  But I kept skipping right through until the end of the 3rd book because I just purely and simply needed to find out what happened.  It was a good enough book to keep my reading until the end.  It technically was not written that well and yet for some reason it was captivating.  I have no regrets for having read it.  At least I am able to discuss it if the topic arises!

B008OOYALE|4.0|I loved this game for my kindle fire. it is very very fun. but my complaint is that unlike the app for phones and i-pods, this one does not have goals. but you do get to breed dragons!

0061122416|5.0|I thought that The Alchemist was a very insightful novel. Paulo Coelho included many useful life lessons  to show to the readers and gave them a chance to examine their own lives and how they live them. The books' simplicity makes it great for all ages and it being so simple makes it so easy to interpret and understand. It is chalked-full of valuable life lessons and ideas that every human being should know or at least be aware of; from listening to your heart and following your dreams, to being one with the world and at peace with what is around you.<br /><br />So many ideas from a variety of religions and faiths have been tossed at you and all you need to do it read the book. Coelho could not have done a better job piecing together hundreds of ideas from so many religions to show how really similar we all are. He has done the human race a huge favor by showing us that no matter who or what we believe in, even if its nothing, that together we still all are very similar and can achieve anything if we work together.<br /><br />The Alchemist has a mix of different levels of realistic qualities  throughout the novel. At some points the book almost becomes boring, however when the tension starts to build and events become exciting, it definitely makes this a worth while read. I personally didn't love this book however I still think that it is a good book. It was written well and for a large variety of audiences and will be an inspirational book for years to come. [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]]
0525953728|5.0|First, I was originally convinced this book should not be published. But having now read it, I no longer have any reservations. There are no secrets or tactical or strategic giveaways in this book, unless practicing until you are bone tired and then doing it somemore to get to where you can do it no matter what the situation is a secret. But its not.<br /><br />I could not put it down. It is down to earth, accurate, and as a wounded warrior, and former Airborne Ranger, I can say this book, if it does anything, makes me proud of the men and women of Joint Special Oprations.<br /><br />Because despite being a delightful and engrossing read, this book doesn't say much that half a dozen other books have already said.<br /><br />Recommend you buy it, you will enjoy it.
1451627297|3.0|I enjoyed the characters, but the protagonist's motivation for taking on the \\"mission\\" is questionable and the ending was a bit hokey. Preferred Under the Dome. Although, like Dome, this one was also too long. (I should also add I wasn't born until the 70s and don't have the same feelings and recollections of the previous era as those alive then might have.)
1589944607|5.0|I don't think I have ever played a board game that so perfectly captured the feel of the source story. Lies. Betrayal. Paranoia. Enemies in every corner and the universe stacked against you. As the human player, you know full well that if you win it is only going to be by the skin of your teeth, and certainly not with all of your crew intact. In fact, after several games we finally had our first \\"win\\" last night after a hard fought battle. It was a brilliant, suspenseful game with the power balance of the Cylon players and the human players coming down to a single flipped card.<br /><br />The game play is complex, and takes an investment of time to learn the rules. Like [[ASIN:1589942108 Arkham Horror]], this is a game that highly benefits from having a resident rules lawyer who can guide less-experienced players through the phases and their options.  We found 4-5 players to be just about right.  A typical games lasts about 3-4 hours, and it can be a long wait in-between turns with too many players.  We have one of the [[ASIN:1589946782 Pegasus Expansion]], that adds to the complexity and game length.<br /><br />The element I love the most about Battlestar Galactica Game is the secret Cylons.  That single piece adds so much tension and enjoyment to the game.  Until the final reveal, you never know who is on whose side, and it all comes down to the finest of wires.  A single flip can change everything when one of your allies reveals himself as the enemy.  That was a brilliant bit of game design, and keeps the game fresh every time you play.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|The Kindle version is great technically. I mean, the maps and text look great and it downloads quickly. But the story is just 'meh'. If I hadn't already been interested in the TV series, I probably wouldn't have continued reading the books. The author has invented a very interesting world but he's not a great writer. Not descriptive, no interesting use of language. On the other hand, I have learned a few words for parts of a castle that I didn't know before. So, there's that. I'm not saying it's a bad book...it's just not great. A solid three stars.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic on Blu Ray is beautiful. But the one question remains: Is it worth spending money on something just for High Definition when you bought it on VHS and DVD prior? The answer is yes. In this edition you get the full movie on one disc and it is beautifully remastered.<br /><br />The box art is beautiful bringing a new image of the film compared to the other VHS and DVD versions. The only thing I was disappointed in was the discs themselves. I was hoping for beautiful artwork on but instead received a normal looking disc, but it doesn't take away from the set in any way.<br /><br />The old special features from the Special Edition DVD version are presented as well as new special features.<br /><br />This is definitely a warm welcome to your Blu Ray collection for sure!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was a little leary about reading this series what with all the bad press I had heard about it just being \\"mommy porn\\". I am so glad I decided to ignore those idiots! This was one of the best series that I have ever read. The storyline was so engaging & entertaining & heartwrenching at times. I couldn't put these books down! I read all 3the books in less than a week * will definitely be reading them again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have purchased a few items including Solitare from Amazon and have found it to be a great experience. Everything went very smooth and was easy to use Amazon. It is a fun and challening game. I would reconmend it to everyone.  Thanks Amazon....
B004A8EI9M|5.0|I normally don't have time for TV series but I was hooked after the first episode. After watching season 2 I can honestly say that the cliff hangars, turn of events and surprises kept coming. I really look forward to season 3.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|Mildly entertaining, totally implausible fluff piece. Not bad, but not really good either. Acting was good, if somewhat over the top sometimes. Fun to see a different interpretation but a little bit of a stretch for me.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I feel that this installment of the trilogy is easily better than the previous one. From a literarty standpoint, all points were covered, and done in quite epic detail. All around awesome movie.
1475143389|5.0|The book is well-written and makes sense, and Matthew is correct in that there's a bajillion bits of \\"advice\\" that contradict each other out there.  The book's not too short or too long and doesn't waste a ton of time with \\"filler:\\"  you can look up how to do the exercises properly online, and aside from the nutritional eating guide, it doesn't waste space with a ton of space-sucking recipes, etc.  Give it a try, as I am:  I'm on week 2 and even though a lot of it is water weight and probably some shock that I'm actually exercising regularly, my muscles feel fuller and I've lost 6 lbs of what's likely water weight and 1-1/2 inches.<br /><br />I'll update this review at the end of the first 8-week cycle.  If it worked, that 5 star will hold and I'll edit/update this written part.  If it didn't, we'll see where we end up and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />That said, for now, based on how much better I'm feeling and the metamorphosis I seem to be undergoing, I highly recommending giving it a shot if you are out of shape and want to try something simple and different to carve off the fat and build muscle!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Many functions not available. Hoping for this to improve over time and be more like Pinterest on the web. Still very pleased Pinterest finally rolled out their own app. Works better on Android phone than Kindle Fire. Lots of failures on Kindle.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I use this app on my HP Touchpad and my WP7 Trophy. Those versions work wonderful, this version on my Fire, terrible. You can look at todays weather, but much of anything else is useless. Trying to add new cities is almost impossible and it hangs up at a point where I have to turn the Fire off. I am going to delete this app.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I love Linkin Park.  I know there are a lot of \\"die hard\\" Linkin Park fans who wish Linkin Park would go back to their nu metal roots, but I personally like to hear them go in different directions.  The Linkin Park essence is always there, and this album has the most rock-ability of any of their recent stuff.  Besides, I think Limp Bizkit still does nu metal... don't they?  Are they even still around?  Who knows, but Linkin Park is still around.  I don't think they would be if every new song was just another \\"Faint\\" or \\"Papercut\\", as much as I love those songs...
B0072OFM28|5.0|The wrighting may be on the wall, even if written in blood, for this series. However, the story respectfully continues the struggle for freedom, both personnally & as a community. So goes the telling of Spartacus. There will be one more season to tell the ending of his story. I look forward to pre-ordering the final DVD set as soon as Amazon allows (beter sooner than later).  I can't hardly wait for my copy to arive \\"soon\\" from Amazon.  I placed my pre-order on 02-06-2012 when the price was at $34.99; on 09-11-2012 the price was at $19.99 (at 3:13pm PDT);<br />so what happened to the \\"lowest price guarantee\\" ???  I paid by Amazon giftcard. So, why hasn't my Amazon giftcard been reimbursed 15.00 (34.99 - 19.99 = 15.00)???<br />You will get a much deeper understanding of history & human nature by watching this extended series that is both edifing & enlightening :) :) :)<br />Have fun !!!<br />JWC II
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great beginning and I never saw the ending coming. It was a good one and made sense. If you have trouble with Sci Fi then it's your loss. I'm going to read all of Crouch I can get my hands on.<br /><br />Perfect? Na. But the problems were niggling details like:<br /><br />The protagonist naked but for a hospital gown straddles a stone wall???? Ouch!<br /><br />A woman hit in the head twice with a baseball bat is still alive???<br /><br />A baddie shooting full auto for ten minutes with an AK with 100 round drum? Only on TV.<br /><br />The rational behind the carnival night of blood and sex is never explained.<br /><br />The protagonist is never sympathetic enough to really care about.<br /><br />But, like I said, the WHAT THE HELL? factor was absolutely marvelous. Buy this one NOW.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The always dependable are counted upon again to deliver the \\"goods\\" :) :) :)<br />This show is so much beter when watched without commercials on DVD !!!<br />Thank GOD there's something left to look forward to on television in this barrion era :( :( :(  I pre-ordered this set back on 09-15-2011 and will order the next season(6.0) \\"ASAP\\" when Amazon allows (beter sooner than later). When I ordered the price was set at $31.49; at 3:07pm PDT the price was at $24.99; the order shipped out today priced at $31.49 (I paid via Amazon giftcard); so, what happened with the \\"lowest price guarantee\\" ???  I should've been reimbursed $6.50 back onto my Amazon giftcard balance...why hasn't it happened :( :( :(<br />Have fun with the physics of laughter :) :) :)<br />JWC II
B00913DPW2|4.0|The reviews on this one are right on - the graphics are great, the music is scary, and man this is a difficult game!  I confess I needed the walk through to finish (but I am really bad at escape games).  The writers thought of everything, there are great touches here and there that will suprise you.  Really my only complaint is my KF didn't always register my tapping, so I'd end up using a hint moth just to find out I had it right all along.  Nice \\"hints and cheats\\" screen that tell you if you've found all the puzzle pieces in that particular scene (need to find them all to finish the game).  Great game!
0767840135|1.0|As I have heard so much about the Cirque Du Soleil shows from my sister who has seen them in Vegas three times, I decided to purchase a DVD.  After reading several good reviews about Quidam, I sent for it.  I received the DVD very quickly but was majorly disappointed in the show.  It was very slow and repetitive and I didn't even bother watching the whole thing.  Maybe it was because it was an older show, but I really wasted my money--I plan to send it to my sister and get her opinion on how it compares to the ones that she has seen.
B005EPFA8I|5.0|Seldom seen Chevaux cave gets the Herzog treatment. Outstanding photography and I hear that the 3D is worth watching for the effects it delivers on cave images.  Some have commented negatively about the filmmaker's commentary but it is a Herzog film, and that is that.  He is after the origins of consciousness etc and mixes music and such in his search.  Music may or not be related to what went on in the cave, which must be why the specialist commenting at the end focuses on painting, which he calls figuration. An excellent viewing experience, very rewarding.  The film music is itself making a point about the timelesness of this sort of human expression.  See it!
B007OV9EYG|4.0|I have to say this movie was not what I expected but the kids and I enjoyed the heck out of it.  The entire story is told through a flashback which often breaks into song and dance numbers.  You will find yourself getting these songs stuck in your head and your kids will sing them to you often.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Lots of great music here. Surprisingly, Bob's rough and aged voice sounds smoother and less harsh than his last album. It's probably his best album since \\"Love And Theft\\". It has some of the best story songs he's done in a very long time. It reminds me of a sequel to \\"Blonde On Blonde\\", only 45 years later. I was lucky enough to score an advance copy. It is definitely worth springing for the deluxe edition. While it doesn't have any bonus tracks, it comes with a cool little booklet with lots of great magazine cover photos from the '60s and '70s and it even comes with a free t-shirt.  I'm not one of those people who try to find greater meaning from a song or a lyric.  I only listen with an open mind and enjoy the music.  This is likely one of the greatest discs to be released this year!!!

B005LAIGSM|5.0|When you have an actor like with Channing Tatum in it has to be good. I haven't yet seen this movie but from what I saw of the commercials on tv it looked good enough for<br />me to get it on borders website. I have seen Channing Tatum in other movies and he is great.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This movie is exceptional! Jiro's sushi looks amazing from every angle. Jiro's care and attention to detail in every aspect of this movie is extraordinary. The story line moves quickly and covers a wide variety of topics to peak your interest from every turn. A must see for anyone who wants to learn more about the art of sushi making.

B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy to learn and play. Two negatives... 1 obviously the ads especially those where the exit is located in a corner. My cover partially obstructs it requiring. that I remove it before I can close it. Very annoying! 2 if you. barely touch a card it moves to a default card which may not be where you want it. More than a few times I kept my stylus on the card and moved it back to its original position yet when I take my stylus off the card it flies off to an unexpected location. There is no undo so that can get frustrating. But it's free....
B008JGSM6G|4.0|very fun game to play, especialy when you are bored. The levels start easy... but it gets to where you have really try hard. I definetly recommend this app
B0074PNCRM|4.0|I enjoyed this book - whilst the topic was sombre, harrowing even, the writing and sub plot was well worth the read.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is a pretty typical Nicholas Sparks book.  I enjoyed it but it was not my favorite of all time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I listened to this audio version on a road trip.  It was another awesome book by Nicholas Sparks, and I hope it will also become a movie.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|A wonderful end to an addictive trilogy. After reading the first 2 books I couldn't wait to get my hands on the last one. I was very skeptical about reading the Fifty Shades trilogy but enjoyed them immensely.  Easy to read, not a complicated story and pure escapism!
0345803485|2.0|I tried to get through this book, even read a few of the end chapters, but I gave up when I realized it wasn't getting any better so I'd better stop wasting my time.  The writing is juvenile and bland, with no sense of prose or even good story telling.  The premise was silly, the characters dull in spite of their sexual exploits...erotica should have some beauty to it...this was just plain teenage fantasy stuff. There are some well written, sexually explicit novels out there that are a good read.  This is not one of them.  I honestly don't get the appeal of this book or the characters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a really picky reader. Really picky.<br /><br />I love this genre, and have never been tempted to try a book by one of the 'little guys' before.<br /><br />I completely appreciate those who are trying to get a foot hold in the game, but I can't say that I have ever read a review that pushed me over the edge to try....until now.<br /><br />Hugh Howey, you are my new interest.<br /><br />Your writing skills measure up to some of my classic and favorite writers.<br /><br />Bravo!<br /><br />Great depth, great characters, believable sci-fi plot....<br /><br />Look forward to hearing from this author in the future, and I know I won't be disappointed!
0739384171|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of the book. Since I drive a lot, it's great to be able to catch up on books I may not normally have time to read. It's always strange to hear one person do everyone's voice, but it was still very entertaining to listen to.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Since I was a teen in the 80's this book was a fun read with all the pop culture references. The story is fast paced and flows along smoothly. I've already reccomended it to several friends.

0143119680|5.0|There are over 1700 reviews before mine, so I'll skip the plot and just give some of my observations!<br /><br />I found this book accidentally. I volunteer at the local library and an audio copy of it was on the staff cart--discards of books that have damage or CD's that skip. I took it off the cart and put it in the car. Was on a two hour trip and bored and put the first disc in the player. I was hooked from the beginning. Normally I'm not fond of vampire sagas. Witches yes, vampires no. Loved Matthew Clairmont (the vampire)  and Diana Bishop (the witch) from the first chapter. It took me over six weeks to finish the audiobook since most trips locally where I live are less than three miles. Normally I would have run to the library and taken out the book to read, but it was so special to me that I didn't want it to end!<br /><br />The author does a great job with the love affair between Bishop and Clairmont and a great job making history come alive. Diana is a scholar and student of alchemy. She is in England working on her scholarly research and requests a manuscript, Ashmole 782 from the reserves at the Bodleian library. Her life immediately changes as the manuscript has long been coveted by not only witches, but demons and vampires and until Diana, no one has been able to retrieve the manuscript.  Matthew, among other studies, has been pursuing research and study in genetics. DNA analysis suggests that the other world creatures are dying out.<br /><br />I enjoyed the developing relationship between Matthew and Diana. It was fascinating to read the author's take on what you should feed a vampire that you invite for dinner. So frequently if you come across vampires in reading romance or romantic suspense their personality is developed and some of the more obvious vampire characteristics are touched upon, but the authors don't delve that deeply into their psyches or the problems of living forever. Along with the history and literature running through the book you'll also learn about wines.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is so multilayered that it is worth savoring and not rushing through to the end. I'm now listening to Book 2 in the trilogy and loving it too.l also learn about wines.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is so multilayered that it is worth savoring and not rushing through to the end.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|There are just some collections that need to be owned. The Aliens Anthology is one of them. I'm not going to go into how great the movies are or the finite details of the set. If you're on this page, you already know. All I'll say is that tremendous care has been put into this set and not only do the films look amazing, but there are special features for days. This is a great investment and highly recommended for anyone who loves science fiction.
B003ES61EE|2.0|This Amazon-branded lens cleaning tool looks like a good deal.  But it doesn't hold a candle to the original Sima Lenspen I replaced.  The only advantage to this item is that is offers a fine point cleaning tip useful for small pocket cameras or a phone camera.  But if you have an SLR or mid-sized Point-and-Shoot camera, you will prefer the original.  The interchangeable tip falls out easily when I am cleaning a lens.  I have since ordered another [[ASIN:B00004TJ0L Sima Lens Pen]] and it is worth every penny.

159514188X|5.0|Before starting Thirteen Reasons Why, make sure you have a solid block of eight hours carved out of your schedule. If you don't, you might find yourself, like me, staying up until 1 am, voraciously devouring chapter after chapter of this thrilling page-turner.<br /><br /> Jay  Asher knows how to torture his readers, dropping hints here and there, and then dragging out their conclusion until the perfect moment to strike.  If he's ever in need of money, I know many shady organizations out there would die to hire him for \\"advanced interrogation techniques.\\"<br /><br /> As mentioned so often before, the dual narration provides an interesting double viewpoint from which to watch the story.  However, this raises a few problems, such as who is addressing whom and whether the current narration is a flashback or not.  Still, I applaud Jay Asher's ingenuity and creativity.<br /><br /> This stereoscopic viewpoint looks over no fluff, either.  Asher deals with one of the most serious subjects with respect and tact;  never do we feel that Hannah's tragic decision is taken light of or made fun of.  Thirteen Reasons Why is a book about a grim subject - suicide - and we feel all the gravity of it.  We start from knowing nothing to feeling the weight on Hannah's shoulders.  Events cascade into one another until we see the full picture, guided on by the dual narration.<br /><br /> We're left thinking over all those things we've said or done to someone else that aren't our proudest moments.  And we're driven to become better people, to respect and love one another.<br /> Is Jay Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why great literature?  Yes.  But also, it is a call for everyone, author and editors included, to come together.<br /><br /> Please, to understand one of the greatest tragedies we face, read Thirteen Reasons Why.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this show.  The minute I started watching it, I was hooked.  I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  The show is not just about survival in this zombie infested new world.  There is also a story.  There are some characters you will really hate, which makes you hope they get eaten by the zombies!!!  It's an entertaining show.  And it's very enjoyable.

B004YM6JP0|5.0|I have already seen the entire Season 3 which was fantastic so I can hardly wait for the Blu Ray release!<br /><br />My only comment is that I noticed that Season 3 will only be available on Ultraviolet.  No Digital Copy!!  Sorry, I really don't like Ultraviolet.  I like the fact that a Digital Copy that works with iTunes will show up as a purchased item on your iTunes account and would allow you access forever.  Furthermore, iTunes also allows me to stream via my Apple TV to my big screen.  It all works quite easily.<br /><br />With Ultraviolet, it seems like every studio does something different.  Some movies you can't even download.  Some movies from Sony and the like make you download a multitude of files, like 10 to 20 files for one movie, that aren't recognizable by anything but some Sony player which also has to be downloaded.  I think Flixster does the same thing as I recall.<br /><br />Apple and iTunes/Digital Copy had it all worked out making Digital Copy a wonderful experience and then some of the other movie companies had to deploy these iTunes wannabe's which really kinda suck!<br /><br />Vudu may work great, haven't tried it yet.  Amazon may work great, haven't tried it.  But I have tried Ultraviolet, Sony and Flixster and they stink!  At least offer an iTunes Digital Copy along with Ultraviolet so we can make a choice!<br /><br />Update 9.18.12:  I recently discovered that some, and I stress only some, movies that are on my Ultraviolet account do tie in to my Vudu account.  I forgot I had a Vudu account since I have never used it.  To use my Vudu account I have to buy another compatible streaming device such as a TV, Blu-Ray, or use a video game system, which for some reason, I just have never got into even though I have both the XBox360 and a PS3.  Maybe I will check out the XBox360 option.  I would probably rather use Roku box but Vudu is not supported on Roku!  I throw my request in with countless others for Roku to sign up with Vudu/Walmart to stream their movies!!
0345803493|3.0|The story is very good,. I'm currently reading the 3rd book and i think this book is the best of the 3. The ending of the first one didnt really make you wanna run to the book store and buy the second one because ***SPOILER ALERT*** she dumps him at the end and they would not have written 2 more books if they weren't gonna get back together. I mean, come on.. But overall it's a good story. The one problem i had with the book, is that they are having sex on like every other page of the book. and it's very repetitive.. which gets a little old, but the book(s) are defiantly worth the read. :)
B007SGM084|1.0|And it should say: Read if you are over 30 and in a stable, healthy relationship.<br /><br />This is not soft porn, the trilogy is hard core porn and it portrays a lie: people don't change. 1 in 1000 can be saved.<br /><br />The trilogy does not only deal with the sexual Dom/sub subculture, it goes through child physical and sexual abuse.<br /><br />It is really hard-core in all aspects, I do not believe this is a book for young adults, it should be rated R.<br /><br />Please, please, if you are young and you think you can save your \\"Christian Gray\\", you are wasting your time.<br /><br />And remember: THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION!!!!!
B003K16P50|5.0|Paul Torday is a talented writer. There is a magical quality about the story, almost fairy tale like because the idea of salmon fishing in Yemen is so absurd. However, as a reader, you feel so actively involved in the characters' lives and thoughts because the book is a collection of emails, letters and diary entries. It's a brilliant book, very clever!

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Reading early reviews of \\"Tempest\\", Bob Dylan's 35th studio album, appeared to indicate that this is, perhaps, Dylan's darkest album and one of his strangest.  This is easily the most violent album he's released.  If you look up the word \\"tempest\\" in a dictionary, this is what you will find: \\"a violent commotion, disturbance, or tumult.\\"  This perfectly describes the lyrical content of \\"Tempest\\", and the world that Dylan writes about.  Everything is in an uproar and the end is coming soon. \\"Tempest\\" is the world being torn apart.  The early reviews have been right - this is Dylan's darkest album, and the body count is quite high.  Dylan told Rolling Stone that in the world described in this album, \\"\\"anything goes and you just gotta believe it will make sense.\\"  But in a world being torn asunder, how much will really make sense?\\"<br /><br />\\"Tempest\\" describes a world gone to hell, sometimes literally, and it is up to humanity to learn how to cope with the often senseless brutality inherent in a world such as the one that we live in.  Across the record, you will find Dylan repeatedly angered, fighting mad and ready to take on the world, even when suffering through the pain.  What has been either passed over or only briefly noted about \\"Tempest\\" is its release date - September 11, 2012.  9-11 did turn the world upside down, and releasing an album like \\"Tempest\\" on 9-11 is quite appropriate - globally we have been in a tempest and that date has come to symbolize so much about the uncertainty and brewing storm we find ourselves in<br /><br />Remembering this is an Amazon.com review and this isn't the place to write a historical treatsie, since 9-11-2001, the world has been turned upside down both internationally and for Dylan's homeland, America.  For those who are Americans, we have gotten in two wars, we elected the first black President, and we have seen the worst economic recession since (appropriately enough in the context of Dylan's career) the 1930s and the era of FDR.  At the time of the album's release, a deeply divided America has been desperately trying to crawl out of the recession, with two different political parties offering radically different visions and paths for the nation to trod to a new era of ever hoped for prosperity that seems so far away, with Europe in the middle of economic collapse as well.<br /><br />Dylan told Rolling Stone: \\"\\"I wanted to make something more religious.  I just didn't have enough [religious songs]. Intentionally, specifically religious songs is what I wanted to do. That takes a lot more concentration to pull that off 10 times with the same thread - than it does with a record like I ended up with.\\" Granted, Dylan tells us he wasn't able to pull off the religious album he was wanting to make, but \\"Tempest\\" has quite the religious feel to it . . . provided you are reading the Book of Revelation with a distinctly American historical context informing the events that you see unfolding before you.  The whole album has Old Testament underpinnings of righteous indignation, hell-fire and brimstone, and judgement from the hands of God.<br /><br />Since 1997 with the release of \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and especially since the 2001 album \\"Love and Theft\\", Dylan has focused on pre-rock musical forms.  Dylan is still mining the American songbook in \\"Tempest\\", appropriately enough his most Shakespean in terms of scope and tragedy.  Musically \\"Tempest\\" is squarely in the same tradition as his last four studio albums of original material - folk, jazzy ballads, crooners, bluesy rockers, roadhouse blues, and even some Tex Mex flavor on \\"Early Roman Kings\\" that so characterized \\"Together Through Life\\".  Like the other four albums, musical allusions and direct lifts appear throughout.  \\"Narrow Way\\" uses a chorus from the Mississippi Sheiks' 1934 blues \\"You'll Work Down to Me Someday.\\"  \\"Scarlet Town\\" alludes to poetry written by 19th-century Quaker poet and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier.  You'll find echos from Louis Armstrong and the Isley Brothers. I'm sure others will surface as time goes on.<br /><br />Dylan has come into a critical renaissance with \\"Time Out of Mind\\" which has gone unabated since.  While \\"Tempest\\" is Dylan's darkest album, \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is Dylan's saddest, most pain-filled album, even more so than \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" documented Dylan's first divorce - \\"Time Out of Mind\\" documented the pain inherent in the divorce and the aftermath of living for years without his love.  Not that \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is literally about his first divorce, but lyrically though, the pain of lost love, so desperately wanted to be reunited with his lover (whoever she may be), and being left in the wastelands without much hope is ever present on that record.  \\"Time\\" shows the listener Dylan living in the aftermath of the catastrophe that is \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and the world-worn weariness he feels.  But he left that life with his lady love \\"somewhere back there along the line\\".<br /><br />If \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is Dylan's most vulnerable, a veritable Garden of Gethesame moment for the aging troubador, \\"Tempest\\" is Dylan going out with guns blazing, despite the scars that the sun didn't heal.  He still feels the pain of lost love, still feels the inherent sadness and strangeness of living in a brutal, decadent world full of senseless violence, but regardless, he will press on.  And that truly is the strength of \\"Tempest\\".  Despite the darkness and the anger, there are some real humanizing moments.  The fourteen minute title track both sensitively handles the Titantic tragedy and also acknowledges the pain and the confusion those who were left must have felt with their families and loved ones dead.<br /><br />Despite all the rage, the fear, the death, the murder, Dylan ends the album on a distinctly humanizing, empathetic note: he pays tribute to a fallen hero of so many, John Lennon . to the slain Beatle John Lennon, who Mark David Chapmanmurdered outside the Dakota apartment building in New York City on December 8th, 1980.  Like all the other songs, \\"Roll On John\\" is violent, but of all the songs here, this is the most elegant and thoughtful meditation to what it means to have to carry on when someone you have loved and admired was taken away so forcibly and so prematurely, and the love Dylan feels for Lennon is quite evident.  And really, that's the heart of the album.  Like \\"Tempest\\" says, sometimes there's no understanding \\"judgement of God\\".  But we have to press on anyway.<br /><br />We live in a strange, sad world, marked with violence, radical terroists, economic uncertainy, nations marked by war and starvation, and power hungry leaders bent on domination.  Dylan provides a snapshot of that world, and shows us how he has dealt with [in] it.  In that regard, \\"Tempest\\" is one of the timeliest records Dylan has ever made.<br /><br />***A brief note about 9-11:  There are two notable facts about this date: first, it is eleven years to the day after the attack on the World Trade Center.  Second, September 11, 2001 was the day that Dylan released his acclaimed masterpiece, \\"Love and Theft\\".  Like the JFK murder in Dallas for those alive during that time, people can tell you where they were on 9-11.  Myself?  Between 8:00 to 8:45AM, I was on Amazon.com on 9-11, posting my review to \\"Love and Theft\\" from an earlier preview copy that I had gotten several days before.  The review is still up, and it's the second oldest review for that album currently available on Amazon.

0224097385|5.0|Ian  McEwan remains one of my favorite living authors. His latest novel SWEET TOOTH  makes my affection for him even deeper. This is another of those stories like Kazuo Ishiguro's  NEVER LET ME GO that too much said about the plot ruins the novel for other readers. I will quote, however, from the first paragraph  of the novel as the narrator herself gives  some secrets-- the book is chockfull of them and irony runs rampant-- away right away: \\"My name is Serena Frome (rhymes with plume) and almost 40 years ago [the early 1970's] I was sent on a secret mission for the British security service. I didn't return safely. Within eighteen months of joining I was sacked, having disgraced myself and ruined my lover, though he certainly had a hand in his own undoing.\\" In the next 300 plus pages Mr. McEwan in flawless prose fills the reader in on how these events came about. The last 20 or so of those pages is the kind that you read through while time stands still. I reacted the same to the last pages of  a novel by another favorite writer many years ago, SOPHIE'S CHOICE by William Styron, one of the supreme joys of reading fine novels.<br /><br />Serena, as complex a character as any of Henry James` women characters, is forced by her mother to study math at Cambridge while her real love is literature, specifically fiction. \\"My mother told me she would never forgive me and she would never forgive herself  if I went off to read English and became no more than a slightly better housewife than she was.\\"  She also is quite adept at getting into relationships  that have no future although she soldiers on in her story  that is set right in the middle of British politics in the early 1970's.  (Serena votes for Wilson for prime minister.) One of the things I find so intriguing about  this novel is all the references made to writers. There are literally dozens of them: Kingsley Amis, Angus Wilson, Edward Thomas, W. H. Auden, Arthur Miller, Bertrand Russell, Margaret Drabble, Iris Murdoch, Robert Lowell, T. S. Eliot et al. Martin Amis, a friend of the writer, also makes a brief appearance. And the characters Tom Haley and Ian Hamilton have a conversation about the poem \\"Whitsun Weddings\\" by Philip Larkin similar to the one that McEwan had with his good friend Christopher Hitchens just days before Hitchens'  death  and that Mr. McEwan recounts in perhaps the most moving of many eulogies given for him. (He also dedicates this novel to Mr. Hitchens.)  I defy you to read McEwan's  words on Hitchens' final days without your eyes burning. In addition to all the other  things going on in this novel , in a strange way it is a book about  books. It is also about deceit, betrayal, jealousy,  innocence (maybe inexperience in the ways of the world is a better word), similarities of  the devices opposing governments use to accomplish similar goals, and ultimately about  forgiveness and four letter words--both hope and love.<br /><br />While Mr. McEwan is a master of creating complex main characters, he is  as brilliant with minor characters as well.  Serena's father, the Anglican bishop who \\"dabbled routinely in the supernatural\\" and won't let his daughters smoke in the house is a prime example. There is a particularly poignant scene late in the novel where, with just a few paragraphs on the part of the author,  we get a completely  illuminating picture of this character.  Serena goes home for a visit at Christmas and begins weeping when her father meets her at the door and folds her into his arms. \\"This was the copious hopeless sort of crying you might hear from a tired child. . . Instantly,  I felt his body tense, even though he continued to hold me.\\" Her father asks if he could \\"fetch\\" her mother. \\"I thought I knew what he was thinking -- that now it was the turn of his older daughter to be pregnant or lost to some other modern disaster, and that whatever womanly mess was now soaking this freshly ironed purple shirt was better managed by a woman.\\"  I have read practically all of Mr.  McEwan's novels and cannot recall one I liked  better.ad practically all of Mr.  McEwan's novels and cannot recall one I liked  better.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Free online premiers, advance videos, selected songs streamed to mobile devices in ten different countries- no album by Bob Dylan has ever been as highly anticipated as \\"Tempest\\". Already the internet has posts claiming it's not as good as \\"Blond On Blond\\" or \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". The way to appreciate \\"Tempest\\" is to enjoy it for what it is NOT.<br /><br />For fifty years, Dylan has not only put his indelible stamp on popular music, he has done more to change it than any other single artist. He once wrote \\"Tin Pan Alley is dead. I put an end to it\\". This is not braggadocio, merely fact. Today, Dylan creates songs for a new era. Granted, he still utilizes the blues, folk and early jazz sounds on his later recordings, but he has no interest in revisiting the past. \\"Tempest\\" is not \\"Desire\\" or \\"Oh Mercy\\". What you hear is what you get.<br /><br />\\"Duquesne Whistle\\" starts the disc off quietly with Donnie Herron's steel guitar and Dylan's piano playing a relaxed melody until drummer George Receli kicks the song into chugging Western swing. Robert Hunter wrote the lyrics to this track. \\"Soon After Midnight\\" is a lovely ballad with typical Dylan wit: \\"I'm searching for phrases to sing your praises\\", but there is darkness here- \\"I've been down on the killing floors/ I've faced stronger walls than yours\\".<br /><br />\\"Long and Wasted Years\\" and \\"Pay In Blood\\" are my favorite cuts. \\"Years\\" is Dylan in a very direct conversation with a woman who probably wants to run as she listens to him ramble negatively about everything around him. Another great lyric: \\"I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes/ there's secrets in them I can't disguise\\". Guitarist Charlie Sexton plays a catchy repeating descending scale that will stay in your head long after you're done listening. \\"Pay in Blood\\" is the hardest song Dylan has written in years. Whoever pushed him into this much anger is responsible for some caustic writing: \\"You bastard, I'm supposed to respect you? Hear me holler, hear me moan. I pay in blood, but not my own\\".<br /><br />\\"Early Roman Kings\\" is the type of Muddy Waters style blues that Dylan has excelled at over the years. David Hidalgo of Los Lobos adds accordion to this track giving the song a Tex/ Mex feel that was featured on \\"Together Through Life\\". Again, Receli's drumming is highlighted, as is long time bassist Tony Garnier. On more than half the disc, Garnier plays stand up bass which fits the dark mood of the album perfectly. \\"Tin Angel\\" may be the most foreboding track on the album. This minor key tune reminds me of Dylan's \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\" by the Traveling Wilburys. Garnier's upright is paired with some tasty banjo by Herron.<br /><br />The title song is the most heralded one on the disc. Dealing with the sinking of the Titanic one hundred years ago, the track has forty seven verses and features violin from both Herron and Hidalgo. Although the song has no chorus, it never gets boring or repetitious (hey, it worked for the Edmund Fitzgerald). Dylan wryly name checks \\"Leo\\" in the verses, probably as an homage to Leo Di Caprio for quoting him in the movie.<br /><br />\\"Roll On John\\" is Dylan's tribute to one of his great friends, the late John Lennon. This isn't one of his greatest compositions, but the feeling of longing is genuine. The track has a beautiful acoustic guitar intro (think \\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" from \\"Blood On The Tracks\\").<br /><br />Some of Dylan's fans aren't comfortable with the coarseness of his voice in recent years. I believe his voice fits his songs over the years to accommodate his writing, especially since 1997's \\"Time Out Of Mind\\". Marianne Faithfull experienced the same change in her voice after years of hard living roughed up her vocals, but gave her singing a compelling edge only earned over time. For these singers, it isn't always pretty, but it WORKS.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks on this disc. No, it isn't \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" or \\"Desire\\"- nor should it be. Dylan is makingmusic different from his past glories- but it is just as valid.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|First off, we've got to give producers Rami and Ronson credit for giving this album the incredible continuity it has. Considering they had to pick from left over odds and ends, everything flows together uniformly... even Bennett's duet doesn't sound out of place here - but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Kicking things off, the reggie-tinged cover of OUR DAY WILL COME was an inspired choice on Amy's part. You wouldn't want her to go down the remake road too often, but this is a perfect pick, and her leisure, care-free vocals give this classic just the right retro-sheen...<br />If she'd have been around, she might have nixed BETWEEN THE CHEATS from seeing the light of day, or at least re-recorded the vocals (you almost wonder if this was a scratch track and it was all Rami had to work with). However, SO wonderfully outrageous and over the top, it can almost be viewed as a DooWop song, or a pariody of a DooWop song.<br />The alternate version of TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN is an interesting listen, but you understand one time through it why the one that graces B2B won the day.<br />In the case of WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME TOMORROW, Ace producer Ronson makes his first misstep; The ponderous, flatfooted (someone else in these reviews said \\"hamfisted\\") production really weighs down Amy's otherwise buoyant vocals. You can feel he was probably going for that Phil Specter \\"Wall of Sound\\" thing, but it just falls flat.<br />That being said, he quickly redeems himself with the infectious fun of the upbeat rocker VALERIE;<br />And then there's THE GIRL FROM IPENIMA... I NEVER thought I'd EVER want to hear this by anyone other than Getz/Giberto, but Amy's joyous vocals breath new life into this time-defying masterpiece; Her inspired scatt singing bursts fourth like a bird taking flight, and you can surely feel that this was from a time in her life when her future seemed bright, and the world spread out unbounded before her.<br />Shifing gears, the more contemplative and introspective HALFTIME could easily be the Jewel in this album's Crown. Along with the previously mentioned ODWC, this one really feels like it COULD have been part of the true 3rd LP. Amy's quiet, slightly halting vocals here give way to the alternate version of WAKE UP ALONE, with it's haunting, sun-too-bright-in-the-morning feel. Although we can guess that the version of WUA that graced B2B was probably picked for that album's overall pacing, it must have been a hard choice between the two of these.<br />Back to a fun reality, the love/hate frienemeny atmosphere of BEST FRIENDS, RIGHT? can't help but make you smile. This segways into the beautiful, smoke-curling languadness of the Bennett duet BODY AND SOUL. As mentioned earlier, there's no jarring continuity issues here with this and anything we've heard up to this point, and the two's harmonizing is amazing. Keen ears will detect, though, that Amy's voice, while still defiant, was fast becoming a battered instrument. Setting the stage for...<br />...The chilling, devestating coda of A SONG FOR YOU. This is like being thrown into ice water. Although her singing is slurry and her words almost unintelligable, the overall impact of this tone poem cannot be missed... This is Amy singing to us from the grave, and the production carries with it the cautionary tale of art, excess, addiction and early demise... Accentuated all the more by Amy's final, spoken musings on Donny Hathaway an Marvin Gaye.<br />Listening to this last piece in the dark truly gave me a start the first time I heard it. I laid there wondering what else she was going to say... But after that, silence...
020161622X|5.0|The book is full of pragmatic advices. It is clear that authors had a lot of experience behind them. All major aspect which every programmer should follow are in the book. It's emphasized that programmers main tool is knowledge - diverse knowledge. Don't stick to one technology, neither one IDE or one operating system - be diverse. History shows us what happened to Cobol, Delphi and C++ - at one moment in time they were overwhelming, today they are quite rare choice for programming high level apps. Perhaps I should mention one thought from the book: 'Good developers tend to be passionate about their work.' With this book authors did a really good job!
B005LAII3U|2.0|The stories and novels of sci-fi futurist Philip K. Dick have been grist for the movie mill for quite some time since BLADE RUNNER hit the big screen in 1982, but it took until 1990 to get a new story of his onto the screen, based on the short story \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\", and that film then became Paul Verhoeven's over-the-top violent sci-fi extravaganza TOTAL RECALL, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox and Rachel Ticotin. Aside from it totally ignoring most of Dick's story, it's an incredibly fun, campy and action-packed romp.<br /><br />With remakes usually equaling big money for the studios (especially if they can also squeeze out some 3D post-conversions or IMAX formatting), and the technical advances made over the last 22 years, director Len Wiseman (the first two UNDERWORLD films, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD) took the reins of a not-totally-a-remake and not-totally-a-reimagining of TOTAL RECALL. As is Wiseman's forte, he makes it slick and gorgeous with some great effects and well-choreographed action sequences. Sadly, he also forgot to add any fun to this tale and he didn't allow any of the actors, such as Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Bryan Cranston and Jessica Biel, to develop any chemistry with each other.<br /><br />Much of the original story's elements are still gone, but Wiseman and screenwriters Kurt Wimmer (also the writer/director of the great EQUILIBRIUM) and Mark Bomback (who also wrote LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD as well as... RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN...) as well as master production designer Patrick Tatopolous (who, along with working with Wiseman on UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, directed the third UNDERWORLD installment, subtitled RISE OF THE LYCANS) have firmly planted this film in a much grittier world of the future than was seen in the original film. It's the late 21st century, and much of the world has been made uninhabitable by chemical warfare, so all of the remaining humanity is now divided into two places in the world to live: the more well-to-do live in The United Federation of Britian and the more disenfranchised live on the other side of the world in the remains of Austrailia, now simply known as The Colony, and the only travel from one side to the other is via a massive gravity elevator called The Fall. We follow the humdrum life of Douglas Quaid (Farrell, playing it totally straight) who is a skilled laborer and his wife Lori (played with relish by Beckinsale). They live together in The Colony, which is a hybrid of the poorest parts of many different countries, with the two main influences being Rio de Janeiro and BLADE RUNNER's Los Angeles (the stacked-level apartments; brightly colored and seedy areas). He dreams of a life he never had and looks for some escapism, and this leads him to Rekall, a memory-implantation parlor where it gives you memories that feel like the real thing, and because his actual dreams are that of a tough-guy black-ops type spy, he selects to get implanted with their \\"Secret Agent\\" package. Although, this touches off a brutal assault on the parlor itself by a number of Federal Police, who Quaid suddenly finds that he is able to calmly disarm and kill all of them. He heads back home to Lori, who initially plays the loving wife and then turns murderous (and British) as she tries to kill him. After disarming her, she tells him that he is not Douglas Quaid; he's got false memories implanted in his head. This catalyst sets off a chain of events where Quaid becomes involved with the mysterious \\"girl of his dreams\\" Melina (Biel, again, totally straight), the corrupt Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston, in a pretty physical performance) and the resistance fighting against Cohaagen's plans to take over the world, led my Matthias (Bill Nighy, not British for some reason). Also, just in case you didn't know, this could still just be a dream.<br /><br />If you've seen the original, you literally have no reason to see this film, becausealthough the film does change the plot of going to Mars and the mutants and the big \\"Blue Sky on Mars\\" mission, this film plays out very much in the same way. The only moments of \\"humor\\" to be found in this film are little nudge-nudge wink-winks to the original (the inexplicable appearence of a three-breasted woman, the fat red-headed woman going through security saying \\"Two weeks\\", etc.). Aside from that, the only fun to be found in this film are the masterfully-created action sequences that take place somewhat early on in the film, such as the fight between Doug and Lori, the magnetic car chase and the super-duper elevator shaft sequence are all incredibly well done and look about as polished as anything in modern film. Unfortunately, the cast (with the exception of Beckinsale) play these moments with deadly seriousness, and it's a real detriment to the enjoyment of the film. This is a SUMMER ACTION FILM REMAKE OF A SUMMER ACTION FILM. Why everyone decided that this should be played in the most serious tone possible was a major misstep for everyone involved. I'm certainly not in favor of all the summer films being without substance or story and should only be these magical one-liner machines, but not only is this film bereft of any real substance, it also just seems like everyone's going through the motions of making futuristic sci-fi. The only one that seems like they're enjoying themselves is Beckinsale, but of course being the director's wife does have its perks. And to be fair to Beckinsale, she is really good.<br /><br />Also other unfortunate side-effects of this remake/reimagining is the distinct lack of two things that were so essential to the success of the first film: First is the violence. This is an exceedingly sterile film. Most of the enemies that appear are these synthetic drone robots which, while being interesting, are by definition soulless automatons. They decided very early on that this was going to be somewhat family-friendly (MUCH more so than the original at least), and made it as bloodless and antiseptic as possible, and the ultra-futuristic setting of the film (people using canoes to navigate flooded streets, elevators that spring up and down and left and right like a bizarre level of a video game, and the deus ex machina of The Fall) is all slicker and polished than it should be. Second, and much more importantly, is the distinction between fantasy and reality, which is a major theme not only of this film, but of Dick's body of work in general. Oddly enough, this was something that was taken much more seriously and more efficiently dealt with in the original film, and it's something that this version tries to do justice, but aside from a few moments in a overly dramatic scene with Farrell, Biel, and Farrell's work buddy Harry (played by Bokeem Woodbine), it doesn't quite connect.<br /><br />As far as performances other than Beckinsale's, whose virtues are dubious but evident, Cranston decides that rather than play a more deliciously \\"evil\\" villain as Cox did so brilliantly in the original, he plays it straight which is to his strengths as we are aware of him currenly as the brilliant actor that gives Walter White such vivid life, but also have forgotten about the time he spent as the bizarre father on MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. This is an actor who is not only dramatic but incredibly comic and both strengths could have been played to. Farrell, who has shown incredible range in his roles over the years, plays this very sullen. There is none of the glint in his eye that he showed in pretty much all of his other roles and none of the charm that one needs to carry a big action film. Jessica Biel is still as bland as she has ever been. I've really tried to find roles she's had over the years that can convince me that she has something to bring to the table other than just a sexy body, and it still hasn't happened, and that's also a big reason that there is zero chemistry between the two leads. Bill Nighy isjust wasted here.<br /><br />I know that this is a film that should exist on its own merits, rather than being compared to the original, but that's part of the territory when it comes to a remake; it's either better, worse or on the same level, and despite the lack of anything close to subtlety in Verhoeven's original, that film is eminently watchable and still very lovable for all of its action cliches. Wiseman's version of TOTAL RECALL is only remarkable for its outstanding visual design (which would have worked much better in any other futuristic action film) and its well-orchestrated set pieces, but sadly lacks the spectacle, heart or fun that a big-budget actioner should have.<br /><br />2/5 Starsn the original at least), and made it as bloodless and antiseptic as possible, and the ultra-futuristic setting of the film (people using canoes to navigate flooded streets, elevators that spring up and down and left and right like a bizarre level of a video game, and the deus ex machina of The Fall) is all slicker and polished than it should be. Second, and much more importantly, is the distinction between fantasy and reality, which is a major theme not only of this film, but of Dick's body of work in general. Oddly enough, this was something that was taken much more seriously and more efficiently dealt with in the original film, and it's something that this version tries to do justice, but aside from a few moments in a overly dramatic scene with Farrell, Biel, and Farrell's work buddy Harry (played by Bokeem Woodbine), it doesn't quite connect.<br /><br />As far as performances other than Beckinsale's, whose virtues are dubious but evident, Cranston decides that rather than play a more deliciously \\"evil\\" villain as Cox did so brilliantly in the original, he plays it straight which is to his strengths as we are aware of him currenly as the brilliant actor that gives Walter White such vivid life, but also have forgotten about the time he spent as the bizarre father on MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. This is an actor who is not only dramatic but incredibly comic and both strengths could have been played to. Farrell, who has shown incredible range in his roles over the years, plays this very sullen. There is none of the glint in his eye that he showed in pretty much all of his other roles and none of the charm that one needs to carry a big action film. Jessica Biel is still as bland as she has ever been. I've really tried to find roles she's had over the years that can convince me that she has something to bring to the table other than just a sexy body, and it still hasn't happened, and that's also a big reason that there is zero chemistry between the two leads.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This thing is amazing.  Comfy, sounds great, great wireless distance.  I had quite a few other headphones before these that just plain didn't work.  These not only work but work amazingly well!<br /><br />Criticisms: The low end sound isn't perfect.  The USB transmitter dongle is a bit gangly if you try and use it without the station connector but it works just fine.<br /><br />The Micro usb connector on the headset isn't really what I would have preferred to charge the darn thing, it is hard to plug in while you are wearing it.  I wish it had a base station or something that to charge it rather than plug it in each and every time.<br /><br />If you want a headset that works amazingly well and get a few bells and whistles as a bonus this is a good headsets.<br /><br />Bruce

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|As any book starts off, a lot of little information in the beginning, but a lot of interesting mysteries form too leaving you with questions and curiosities right from the start. I was surprised by the introduction of vampires to this tale of a witch and it left me even more interested, pushing me further into the story. Finding out who is a friend, foe or possibly something more while trying to solve Diana Bishop's other magical problems left me loving this book and diving right into the next one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is a awesome app best thank yous to the people created this app!! it is a dream come true!
0553386697|5.0|I really appreciated this book. It's one of the clearest books I've read on the latest findings in neuroscience and how these findings can help us become better parents.  The book is very well-organized and easy to understand, which is an accomplishment when tackling the beast that has become brain research. Some folks complained that it's very simplistic. Well, it's not the last word on parenting. But this book can be one of the parenting books you rely upon to give you smart, effective strategies to not only help your child navigate difficult moments but also to nurture your family connections.

0345525558|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than any book I have read in a long time.  At first I wasn't sure I would and there were times when I wanted to hit the main character of the story over the head with something but it kept me interested all the way through.  I felt that the ending was realistic.  I hope I will be able to find more books as good as this one.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|good game to pass the time....some strategy involved and more challenging as you progress.make sure to try the extra assists as you earn them as they are not explained in detail to avoid running out of time and having to repeat stages.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  I find it hard to put down.  It was my 1st ever purchase on kindle and it was a GREAT choice. I highly reccomend this book if you like erotica and can deal with intamacy out of the normal scope. I already bought Fifty Shades of Grey: Darker, Book 2, so I can start in right after I finish book 1.

0393327655|1.0|-<br />My review will be in the form of a relevant citation, so that the reader can evaluate the issue unbiasedly.<br /><br />I reproduce below a most disturbing piece from this book:<br /><br />\\"The link between belief and behavior raises the stakes considerably. Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. This may seem an extraordinary claim, but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live. Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion, while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others. There is, in fact, no talking to some people. If they cannot be captured, and they often cannot, otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self-defense. This is what the United States attempted in Afghanistan, and it is what we and other Western powers are bound to attempt, at an even greater cost to ourselves and to innocents abroad, elsewhere in the Muslim world. We will continue to spill blood in what is, at bottom, a war of ideas.\\"<br /><br />Let's bear in mind what Sam Harris is saying: \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them.\\" Plus: \\"This is what the United States attempted in Afghanistan\\"<br /><br />Now, I checked out Sam Harris' \\"response to controversy\\" webpage at his site (I will give the url address in the comments section of this review). It is updated in August 9, 2012 (version 2.2, Harris says). There, Harris says, regarding this passage from him that I reproduced above, that:<br /><br />\\"This paragraph appears after a long discussion of the role that belief plays in governing human behavior, and it should be read in that context. Some critics have interpreted the second sentence of this passage to mean that I advocate simply killing religious people for their beliefs. Granted, I made the job of misinterpreting me easier than it might have been, but such a reading remains a frank distortion of my views. Read in context, it should be clear that I am not at all ignoring the link between belief and behavior. The fact that belief determines behavior is what makes certain beliefs so dangerous. When one asks why it would be ethical to drop a bomb on Osama bin Laden or Ayman Al Zawahiri, the answer cannot be, 'because they have killed so many people in the past.' These men haven't, to my knowledge, killed anyone personally. However, they are likely to get a lot of innocent people killed because of what they and their followers believe about jihad, martyrdom, the ascendancy of Islam, etc. As I argued in 'The End of Faith,' a willingness to take preventative action against a dangerous enemy is compatible with being against the death penalty (which I am). Whenever we can capture and imprison jihadists, we should. But in most cases this is impossible.\\"<br /><br />I will point out the following issues, as \\"explained\\" by Harris above:<br /><br />1- \\"This paragraph appears after a long discussion of the role that belief plays in governing human behavior, and it should be read in that context.\\"<br /><br />MY COMMENT: Harris is lying when he says that it appears after a *long* discussion. As a matter of fact, it appears pretty much at the beginning of chapter 2, actually in the third page of it, and after a VERY SHORT discussion of the role that belief plays in governing human behavior (and chapter one cannot count as part of the \\"long discussion\\" because it is non specific, dealing with the link between belief and behavior too loosely). More: when read in that context, this passage from Harris seems pretty much out of place, that is, it seems almost to come out of nowhere. Throughout most of the chapter, Harris seems emotionally sound and, correspondingly, rationally wise and correct. Yet, in this passage, and in just a few others in the chapter, an up-rise of blind emotion and hatred seems to guide his writing process. It seems pretty much aberrant when compared to the remaining chapter.<br /><br />2- \\"Some critics have interpreted the second sentence of this passage to mean that I advocate simply killing religious people for their beliefs.\\"<br /><br />MY COMMENT: That is exactly what he is saying. Not *all* religious beliefs. And not *only* religious beliefs. But that is indeed what he is saying.<br /><br />3- \\"Read in context, it should be clear that I am not at all ignoring the link between belief and behavior.\\"<br /><br />MY COMMENT: Someone is trying to swindle me out of my intelligence here! Harris is definitely *not ignoring* the link between belief and behavior. What he is doing is stating that *this very link* is responsible for a danger that justifies killing people for what they believe!<br /><br />4- \\"The fact that belief determines behavior is what makes certain beliefs so dangerous.\\"<br /><br />MY COMMENT: Only in his wicked mind does belief *determines* behavior. Belief is one of the elements influencing behavior. This man is not a scientist, or a scientifically oriented person. He is a Priest. A Fatwa Issuer Priest.<br /><br />As I have said aplenty elsewhere, especially when criticizing the works of New Atheist Victor Stenger, these self acclaimed New Atheists are actually Vultures feeding on events that shocked whole nations, like the September 11th, and who use these events to promote themselves and to get money out of it. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br /><br />Buy them if you will.<br /><br />Julio Siqueiracess. It seems pretty much aberrant when compared to the remaining chapter.<br /><br />2- \\"Some critics have interpreted the second sentence of this passage to mean that I advocate simply killing religious people for their beliefs.\\"<br /><br />MY COMMENT: That is exactly what he is saying.

B0087ZFH94|4.0|I have been a fan of Mike Oldfield for years, since tubular bells. I was surprised and disappointed there were no tracks from \\"Earth Moving\\" in this collection. I love that CD. However, there are some really great tracks in this set. Two Sides covers a lot of time and you can get a feel for the various moods Mike Oldfield records. From the mystic and beyond. I recommend this CD to any one who really likes good music.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Here is another game that might have been designed as a weapon of antisleep.  It is like a combination of the old game Helicopter combined with Donkey Kong or something of the sort.  As  I play into the early morning, repeating over and over- this will be the last game, it doesn't get any easier to put the Kindle down and say 'Hasta la vista, Barry.'
B0041KKYD8|5.0|I haven't seen the original. For a film like this i put it in a category i call revenge flicks which this pretty much sums up the movie in the fewest words. The beginning is a little slow for the set up of the film but once it starts to go it only takes one break from there before it gets back to nonstop revenge. The back story is simple almost to a fault but cant really complain to much for that. The first half of the movie is definitely not for the weak of heart. I've seen it before on DVD and the Blu-ray version is actually worth the upgraded format(some movies just dont have a good enough quality upgrade to justify the Blu-ray verson)
B006H5120E|3.0|I purcharsed this today and was disappointed that the 3D wouldn't play for me. Turns out here you need either a 3D TV or a blu-ray player that features 3D. All my other 3D movies come with glasses and plays on the simplist players. This is only specified on the back in dark microspopic font. Big let down.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I have always liked Scott Jurek. I like how he's one of the best ultrarunners ever. I like his vegan ways. I like how he seems to be a cool, down-to-earth guy. I was happy when he was featured in another awesome book Born to Run. So I was looking forward to reading this book, to find out how the man came to be. One of the lines that stands out the most for me is one that his dad used to say to him: \\"Sometimes you just do things!\\" Whenever I don't feel like running that extra mile or going to the grocery store or getting my car tuned up, I tell myself \\"Sometimes you just do things!\\" and it works! Scott's book is full of all kinds of motivating things like this, and the vignettes of his life tend to echo in one's mind: stamping through the snow and chopping wood during his strained childhood, running up and down mountains over and over again to train for the Western States. And he takes us through his emotional journey along with his racing journey, as he tries to explain why he's the best. My only criticism is that the book ended abruptly and was too short; I wanted more! Did I also say that the book includes amazingly awesome vegan recipes, many of which I've already tried?
B00003CXCD|4.0|I love this movie.  The dynamic between Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck was hypnotizing.  They made me laugh and cry.  The ending...  What can I say...  It was simply amazing!  An awesome movie.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|There's been no singer-songwriter in the near 60-year history of rock music who's a better storyteller than Bob Dylan. He proved it with his (now legendary) humble folk beginnings, and he continues to prove it today, as evidenced by the very dark, very epic 'Tempest,' an album that can proudly stand next to the best of his post-'Blood on the Tracks' repertoire.<br /><br />After a somewhat lean 1980's and even leaner early-mid 90's as far as quality output from Dylan, he's now in the midst of a pretty remarkable 15-year renaissance beginning with 1997's near-perfect 'Time Out of Mind.' Every album in that span has been extremely well-received and critically-acclaimed--with only '09's 'Together Through Life' receiving even the mildest of criticisms--and I have a pretty strong feeling this trend will continue with his latest. As someone who's been slightly burnt-out on Dylan over the past few years, I think it's safe to say he won't be coming out of my rotation anytime in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Right out of the gate his larynx sounds utterly destroyed on the swingin,' country-jukebox dance-floor number, \\"Duquesne Whistle,\\" but that doesn't take anything away from the song. In fact, it adds a certain kind of charm, giving Dylan a swagger that's been wholly earned through his 50 years of musical storytelling and lessons. His voice is one that demands to be listened to--now as much as ever. And I dare you to stay still in your seat during this track.<br /><br />After bringing it down a notch with the tender ballad, \\"Soon After Midnight,\\" Dylan kicks it back into first with the rowdy Chicago blues stomp of \\"Narrow Way,\\" and when his weary, gravelly voice spouts \\"It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way,\\" you believe him wholeheartedly. And later, when he sings \\"I pay in blood, but not my own\\" on \\"Pay in Blood,\\" you almost wish you didn't believe, so convincing are his words. \\"Scarlet Town\\" is one of Dylan's most haunting, most beautifully hypnotic songs ofhis career, and even at seven-plus minutes, it feels too short.<br /><br />\\"Early Roman Kings\\" is another blues number, copping the oft-used and instantly recognizable \\"Mannish Boy\\" riff that Muddy Waters made famous six decades ago, and to good effect, but the centerpiece of the album is undoubtedly the 14-minute title track, a 45-verse waltz recounting, in Dylan's inimitable way, the Titanic disaster of 1912. He does justice to the victims of that tragedy, putting his heart and soul into each and every verse, even while slyly dropping \\"Leo\\" and \\"Rose\\" into the song, obvious references to James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster. The first time I heard it, I thought it ran a bit long, and had to control my urge to skip ahead. The next time I just drifted off and let Dylan bring me into his world, into HIS version of the event, and the result was powerful--even moving.<br /><br />The album, while mostly filled with revenge and redemption-themed songs, closes on a much prettier note with \\"Roll On John,\\" a loving tribute to John Lennon. Being the last of three straight epic, somewhat meandering tracks, one would think the listener would grow weary by this point, but that could not be further from the truth. This was another one that had to grow on me--as it initially seemed directionless and weirdly sung--but I soon viewed it to be one of the most beautiful, touching moments of Dylan's entire oeuvre, even quoting Lennon himself with \\"I heard the news today, oh boy,\\" referring to his 1980 assassination.<br /><br />It's a fitting, perfect end to what could be argued is his most impressive and consistent effort since 2001's 'Love and Theft,' possibly even since 'Time Out of Mind' from four years prior, though not quite on the level of that, or his 60's and 70's classics, imo. But that would be asking too much. There aren't many artists who've remained as relevant as he has for fifty years and thirty-five albums, while at the same time continually putting out such strikingly original work.<br /><br />My hope is that he'll continue to do so for another decade, at least. But I count myself--and the world at large--as fortunate to have had him around for any length of time at all.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5

As Al Pacino said 'just when I thought I was out...they pull me back in!'. The end, I was so depressed for a week I didn't want to eat. It was a gut shot that reminds you authors own there worlds and sometimes the rose colored glasses shatter when you least want them to.

B001F3FUK6|3.0|I bought this because I love the superman movies and thought the blu-ray version would be the full 1080p experience but unlike blu-ray for newer movies such as The Dark Knight, etc this quality really sucks big time. It almost looked like they up-converted it to \\"blu-ray\\" and it is no better than DVD quality. I should have expected this given that this film started filming back in 2004. Even the extras were only 720 interlaced....<br /><br />Basically, waiting for Superman 2013

B006JJBFK0|5.0|This album is pure emotion, a roller-coaster of highs and (very little)lows that will make you headbang most of the time, and with certain passages, bring you out in tears... it is absolutely, absolutely amazing!!!<br /><br />Rarely have I heard such an album...without a doubt, it will be compared to Nightwish's recent effort Imaginaerum, with its bombastic production, with a Tarja-like vocal style...<br /><br />But this is a fresh approach to an overworked genre... with a new vocalist, totally suited to the band, Xandria will take the crown for symphonic metal band of the year!<br /><br />By track 7, 'The Dream is still alive', I was trying to hide the fact that I was weeping. ... and the riffing, I was blown away by the guitar-work. Beautiful solos, not over the top shredding, but tastefully done with emotion.<br /><br />There are no fillers in this album, and it is great to just let it rip through the car stereo speakers as you blast down the road... I finish up taking longer routes just to listen to this masterpiece...<br /><br />10 out of 10!

0547564651|3.0|(NOTE:  I was provided with a free ARC of this book prior to this review.)<br /><br />Since my daughter entered an urban school district with many failing schools, I've been interested in how you can bring the whole system up given the challenges faced with poverty, lack of parental involvement, and the stress of living in high crime areas.<br /><br />Author Paul Tough takes a look at the approaches being taken to help high risk students and comes away with the hypothesis that what helps kids at risk succeed is the following:<br /><br />1) A life in which a child is shielded from stress as much as possible, both at home and in the surrounding environment.<br />2) Building qualities of character like grit, resilience, and optimism.<br />3) Community, school, and even medical programs that focus on providing support for these students and drive them to succeed rather than warehouse them until they reach the age where they're forced to fend for themselves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, How Children Succeed spends so much time pointing to anecdotes that support these principles that the science and statistics that support it tend to get lost in the shuffle.  While these ideas seem intuitively obvious, it would have been nice to read more about contrasting approaches to helping kids at risk and why those approaches may be failing.<br /><br />One thing that the book makes clear is that as a country we seem to have spent precious little time analyzing what works in education and instead are focused on the next big thing in solving what ails many of our public schools.  Paul Tough also calls both liberals and conservatives to task for politicizing education without addressing that the arguments of both sides have merit.  Yes, conservatives are right when they say that kids can't succeed without building their character, and liberals who have difficulty discussing the role that bad parenting has in the failure of kids to achieve are not helping.  But Tough also says that liberals are right in saying it takes a village to help these kids succeed, and that we need to invest money in programs to help provide the support they need.<br /><br />How Children Succeed provides an interesting glimpse into the ways in which we can help our children and our public schools perform better.  If nothing else, it makes it clear that there is no one miracle solution that will solve our problems in public education.s are right in saying it takes a village to help these kids succeed, and that we need to invest money in programs to help provide the support they need.<br /><br />How Children Succeed provides an interesting glimpse into the ways in which we can help our children and our public schools perform better.

B008ULRY78|3.0|don't get me wrong. the movie is good but there was ALOT of hype to it and the amount of action in this film. I feel like i've seen most of it before. maybe it's just the times we live in now, but this was nothing groundbreaking. By no means was watching this film a waste of time though. Decent plot and when there's action sequences, they are great. Fun movie to watch but don't be expecting anything groundbreaking.
B008KOMMTA|4.0|I can honestly say forking over the $70 for the collectors edition was a huge waste of money. From the outside, the box looks pretty, the same size as many other box sets in it's class. However upon opening the box the contents are just sitting in there in a very poor quality holding system. First off, my set had the little tabs broken off which keep the disc case from sliding around the inside of the large outside box. The book is very very thin and the photos are NOT glossy as I expected. The little pack of cards and extras is kind of neat, however not worth the $40 more for the collector's set. It just seems cheap.<br /><br />The movie PQ and 3D are amazing. The audio is perfect and I can honestly say this is the best looking 3D movie I have ever seen. The movie, especially the 3D version is very well worth it, however I would pass on the Collectors Edition. Regret is a very strong word, and I will use it here in regards to this set. The 3D 4-disc edition would be the best to pick up, it's an amazing movie and a very well done transfer.

B008OGJXJ6|4.0|Tempest is a violent album. There's a lot of fighting going on, and a lot of dying too. It's bleak, stark, and kind of scary...<br /><br />It's also quite remarkable. Dylan never ceases to amaze, setting off in unexpected new directions even at age 71.<br /><br />In Scarlet town you fight your father's foes<br />Up on the hill a chilly wind blows<br />You fight em on high and you fight em down in<br />You fight em with whiskey, morphine and gin<br /><br />What's going on here?<br /><br />Dylan in 2012, talking to Rolling Stone about Tempest: \\"I wanted to make something more religious. I just didn't have enough [religious songs]\\".<br /><br />Dylan in 1965 talking to reporters at a press conference: \\"I'm not on drugs. I just have a nervous disorder\\".<br /><br />Hmmm...<br /><br />Anyway, this time around Bob goes on to comment that it's an album, \\"where anything goes and you just gotta believe it will make sense\\".<br /><br />So it is, and yeah, so you do.<br /><br />Much has been written about the darkness that shrouds the songs of Tempest. And yes, dark it is indeed, as may befit the times. Dylan's always been adept at pointing out which way the wind is blowing and sometimes it ain't pretty. The times they are a changin', but not necessarily for the better.<br /><br />And so it starts with Duquesne Whistle,<br /><br />Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away...<br /><br />Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart<br /><br />Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing<br />Blowing like it's gonna kill me dead...<br /><br />And so, only a few verses into Tempest, death makes its entrance, and stays there pretty much to the end.<br /><br />The sound of all this is taut - like something's going to snap at any moment. It's blues / rock with banjo, violin and accordion woven in, and over it all Dylan's voice; broken, tattered, tortured and torn, perfect for expressing the shadows that seem to grip the songwriter's soul in his seventy first year.<br /><br />Next up is Soon After Midnight, which on the surface sounds like a light hearted ditty. But listen closer:<br /><br />My heart is cheerful it's never fearful<br />I've been down on the killing floors<br />I'm in no great hurry<br />I'm not afraid of your fury<br />I've faced stronger walls than yours<br /><br />In Narrow Way things get a bit gruesome...<br /><br />Ever since the British burned the White House down<br />There's a bleeding mood in the heart of town<br />I saw you drinking from an empty cup<br />I saw you buried and I saw you dug up<br />It's a long road; it's a long and narrow way<br /><br />Sure is.<br /><br />Look at what's going on in Long and Wasted Years:<br /><br />My enemy crashed into the dust<br />Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust<br />He was run down hard and he broke apart<br />He died in shame, he had an iron heart<br />I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes<br />There are secrets in `em that I can't disguise<br /><br />No doubt.<br /><br />Pay in Blood takes us to an even bleaker place.<br /><br />Night after night<br />Day after day<br />They strip your useless<br />Hopes away<br />The more I take<br />The more I give<br />The more I die<br />The more I live.<br /><br />And then the eerie and hypnotic Scarlet Town. Sounding a bit like Man in Long Black Coat comingled with Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), Dylan takes us through the haunted streets:<br /><br />In Scarlet Town in the hot noon hours<br />There's palm leaf shadows and scattered flowers<br />Beggars crouching at the gate<br />Help comes, but it comes too late<br />By marble slabs and in fields of stone<br />You make your humble wishes known<br />I touched the garment but the hem was torn<br />In Scarlet Town where I was born<br /><br />Did Bob really say that he didn't have enough religious songs? Or is he just sprinkling in the imagery for the fun of it?<br /><br />The mayhem continues in Early Roman Kings.<br /><br />I can strip you of life<br />Strip you of breath<br />Ship you on down<br />To the house of death<br /><br />The next song, Tin Angel is a sinister and urgent telling of a tale of a love triangle that ends in blood. Here's how Dylan sets up the arrival of the avenger:<br /><br />Well he threw down his helmet<br />And his cross handled sword<br />He renounced his faith<br />He denied his lord<br />He crawled on his belly<br />Put his ear to the wall<br />One way or another gonna end it all.<br /><br />And then the final two songs - Tempest, about the sinking of the Titanic and Roll on John, about the murder of John Lennon.<br /><br />So.<br /><br />Bob sets out to write a bunch of religious songs and comes up with darkness, death, murder and mayhem. I guess you just have to take him at his word when he says \\"...you just gotta believe it will make sense\\".<br /><br />Along the way it'll give you a lot to think about. And it'll grab a hold of you too.rly Roman Kings.<br /><br />I can strip you of life<br />Strip you of breath<br />Ship you on down<br />To the house of death<br /><br />The next song, Tin Angel is a sinister and urgent telling of a tale of a love triangle that ends in blood.

043902353X|4.0|The book arrived in due course (as fast as international shipping would allow), and I immediately set about reading it, as I had much looked forward to it after the first book in the series. Catching Fire is almost everything I dreamed it would be. I soon devoured it within a couple of days and am now pursuing the third book in the series. The only bad thing about it was there was an awfully long period of only thoughts being recorded and not the action which I found so exciting! All in all, I am giving it four out of five stars.
044024630X|4.0|This story is set in 1997 and it takes us back to a younger Jack Reacher who is still with the military. When a dead body turns up pointing fingers to a soldier from a nearby military base, Jack Reacher is sent undercover to a small town in Mississippi. At the same time another MP is officially sent to the base to investigate the case. Reacher is wary from the beginning and his wariness is not without reason. In this small sleepy town not everything as it seems. There has been more than one murder, soldiers on the base may be involved in military activities that are not publicly known and the local Sheriff may not be what she claims to be either...<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a class act and he is the only character with the `larger than life' feel that I believe in. The six feet five inches tall, weighing between a hundred and hundred fifty pounds - Jack Reacher is a MP who can not only take out several opponents singlehandedly, but also has excellent deduction skills. Once again his power of deduction, physical strength and alertness is put to test. There is this particular situation where Reacher inspects a destroyed car for clues that is absolutely amazing. Also, for the first time, I felt that there was a character who could truly match Reacher in his skills, strengths and thirst for justice. Elizabeth Deveraux is that character. She is almost a female version of Jack Reacher himself. She is an ex-marine who has already put in a good number of years in service and thus has the experience and knowledge herself. She is `finds out' Reacher immediately and though they do not trust each other at the beginning, as they work together they do develop a mutual respect.<br /><br />As a plot, it is the traditional `who-dun-it' sort. As the story progresses more than one suspect are revealed so that the readers are bound to play the guessing game. But yes, it is not as complex as some other Reacher novels. A few familiar names/faces turned up in this book including Francis Neagley - who I have a soft spot for. This book also tells us how and why Reacher left the military and became a `drifter'. Without giving out any obvious spoilers - during the course of the plot, situations arise when he questions the military policies and has conflicts with his superiors. But ultimately his adherence to truth makes him take some truly drastic measures.<br /><br />If you have read a Jack Reacher novel before, then you always pick up the latest book with certain expectations. With Lee Child's consistency, with each novel your level of expectation rises higher and higher. So when I picked up this 16th novel in the Jack Reacher Series (this must be my 11th or 12th time reading a  Jack Reacher), I picked it up with much trepidation. Will he be able to maintain his quality? Oh well, I need not have worried... Lee Child has simply done it again with extra kudos for the character of Elizabeth Deveraux.<br /><br />I got a complimentary copy in exchange of my fair and honest opinionNeagley - who I have a soft spot for.

0465043577|5.0|He argued that financial markets do not follow a Gaussian (aka, \\"aenormal\\" or bell curve) probability distribution of up and down changes. Instead, financial markets follow a LÃ©vy distribution. He proceeds to destroy all of the principles of the CAPM model, which is orthodox b-school finance theory. His disciple is Nassim Taleb, author of Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role off Chance in Life and in the Markets and The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable (various printings). They both argue that \\"fat tail\\" probability events happen with regularity. That is a 3, 6 or 10 standard deviation swing in stock prices can be routinely observed.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|This review contains thoughts of what I personally think about the movie itself and what my expectations of this blu ray should be.<br />First off-this film is incredible. Never mind the what some call sappy love story. This film is brilliant and had so much effort put into making it.<br />James Cameron is on my top 5 favorite director lists along with Spielberg and Ridley Scott of course. The first time you watch this film it affects you in a huge way. The thought of all these people fighting for their survival and some knowing they will not make it off the ship alive. The song Celine Dion performs well you got to admit your eyes pour out tears when you hear it. I am a big believer and worshipper of visual and special effects. Just not overly CGI crapped out though. The process to making this film look as real as possible is absolutely amazing in its own way. Now, here are my expectations for the blu ray release. Hopefully on the bonus features there should be an in depth process on the making of this beautiful ship 'cause you wonder- \\"How did Cameron achieve The stunning, visual, shots which are set forth so stunningly in this picture?\\"<br />Hopefully the transfer is cleaned up a bit so as to have an enjoyable experience watching it. I heard for the blu ray that the disc art is plain. I always love when there is disc art. It is a minor setback but hopefully does not take away from the incredible experience that this has to offer in so many ways. Well I just ordered the blu ray version. No blu ray 3d since I do not own a 3d TV. But as I have heard Cameron say in interviews that and I quote- \\"Even watching this film in 2d, It looks better than when first released back in 1997.\\" So that sounds good to me. So basically I encourage anyone out there reading this review to go pick this up in resect to the 100th sinking anniversary of the titanic and for a sureal viewing experience as to delight any viewer who has a love for cinema and its movies as brought forth for thepublic watching.

0385613857|5.0|I was so excited when this book arrived in the mail, and I was not disappointed. Brisingr is a great book. I couldn't put it down. If you have read the first two books in the series, be sure to get this book. If you haven't read any, what are you waiting for? This is a great book series, that will keep you interested from start to finish.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|My brother has said quotes from this movie for years and i never knew why. One of the funniest movies i've ever seen. Almost every line in the movie, is a line you wish you could remember to use on people in the everyday sense. I liked it so much i found a soundboard for my iphone, bought shirts off ebay with stuff on them from the movie, bought my brother the bowling shirt jeff bridges wears in the movie, etc.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is really an excellent read.  I am now reading the third book in the trilogy and I can't peel it away from my face.  It's just excellent!!!

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Whenever a book gets adapted to a movie, something is lost.  Whether that's character depth, minor plot elements, or perspective, it's simply not possible to fully translate what is essentially an inner, thought-driven medium into something we experience through more external senses.  In the case of The Hunger Games, the challenge is to translate a first-person-narrated book into more of a third-person experience.  How can the directors express Katniss' thoughts when she only speaks to other people?  How does she really feel about Gale?  About Peeta?  It's tricky, but the directors use understatement very well (witness the \\"You call that a kiss?\\" note) and express Katniss' emotions through other people's lines (the movie gives words to the Hunger Games commentators; the book does not).  Short shrift is given to Katniss' relationship with her mother, with Prim, with other people in her district, and even to some degree with Gale.  Peeta's parents are barely mentioned; Katniss' father never is.  Probably necessary casualties of a film adaptation, so read the book for a bit more character development.<br /><br />I'll say that the movie was far less gory than I expected, having read the books.  That's a good thing, given the movie's target audience.  No serious blood, but the neck-breaking scene was still disturbing, and Clove is still her usual sadistic self.  The muttations are far less demonic than in the book, and Peeta's injury appears somewhat trivial here compared to the book's festering wound right by his crotch.  No tourniquets here, no post-Games heart attacks for Peeta, no false leg. Still, don't let your children see this without seeing it yourself--I've seen tons of R-rated films that are far less disturbing (though may use more swearing).  They (and you) will want to talk about it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games tackles themes (children killing each other, authoritarian government) most of us would never think about on our own; for that alone, it's worth experiencing either as a book or as a movie.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Having read Book 1, it was a \\"must do\\" to read Book 2. I enjoyed the book, and there was enough \\"suspense\\" that made it a real page turner. Honestly, though, I was eventually bored by one sex \\"scene\\" after another. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who read Book 1.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I don't often feel compelled to write a review for a book, but I truly am glad I read this book. It's absolutely heart-wrenching at times, but it is a story that I wish more people were aware of. It feels disrespectful for me to say that the story told in the pages of this book were entertaining, but I was glued to the pages (or in my case, the screen on my phone) beginning to end. It's unfortunate that so many won't read this book and get a TRUE look at what these men go through in combat around the world and how our policies, influenced by the media, sometimes dictate the difference between life and death for these exceptional Americans. You need to read this book.
0061122416|3.0|Paulo Coelho's short novel The Alchemist was didactic but also repetitive and confusing. Some would even go as far as to call it boring. However the overall message of the book was a new perspective of life that I hadn't considered before.<br /> There were a couple of parts in the book where I really had to stop and think about the way my life could be impacted if any of the events that happened were real. The protagonist, Santiago, went out in search of his \\"personal legend\\" that led him to realize that the entire world was connected through the \\"Soul of the World.\\" Anyone can achieve anything if they try hard enough. However when Santiago tries to turn himself into the wind using his knowledge of the world, it gets a little hard to comprehend. Many of the metaphors used are confusing and take many attempts to understand which ends up taking most of the fun out of reading it.<br /> There are very few exciting parts of the novel, Santiago mainly travels and tries to learn the ways of the alchemist. On his travels he gets mugged and has to stay in one are at work his way to more funds so we are forced to read aspects of daily life that we ourselves live. He gets mugged at least three times throughout the journey. Every time he stays in one place he become content with life and is then forced from his new home on a wild goose chase. Overall the book was good but not the best.

B00129H7VS|4.0|This movie is without a doubt the best film ever. 10 stars worth. However, the packaging came dented on all corners and slightly smashed. The cardboard box was untouched. Tells me the problem was not with shipping but with storage and handling wherever the product is stored before shipping.  The beautiful tin case could be built with better construction to avoid this problem.

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I was impressed at how Kristen acted in this movie, she indeed met and passed my expectations. Chris Hemsworth also provided an interesting role in the movie same as Sam Claflin.
B006H5120E|2.0|Clearly (frankly, un-cleary), Camaron's Titanic movie was not meant for 3-D.  Only two stars were given for the upgrade in Cameron's effort and there are a few good scenes.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this conversion, sorry folks.<br /><br />Over-The-Shoulder shots, images which focused on a character in the middle, the closer objects are excessively blurred.  Most distant backgrounds weren't annoying, though.  Naturally, blurred images are a focal strategy when a photographer/producer would want to lead his audience's attention on a subject hence everything upclose or further into the background is blurred.  A normalcy and it's professional photography when seen in 2-D because it helps the filmographer steer his audience to a the subject matter.  I never found it to hurt the eyes and this technique works well with 2-D.  However, in a 3-D conversion, particularly when the movie wasn't originally shot in 3-D, evidently this becomes blinding.<br /><br />I'm not a professional in photography, by any means.  Just a logical assumption.  Actually, closer images should be sharper in real life world.  In 2-D, you would need to blur an image to represent depth.  However, in 3-D you already have depth.  So when you take the artificial 2-D depth and combine it into 3-D, it's overkill and I believe this would explain the blurriness I've seen in this movie.<br /><br />Blurriness in this Titanic movie was evident everywhere, whether with various objects like the mast and funnel wire supports and/or the backs of fronts of peoples heads.  I know, these details aren't important at that moment.  But the \\"you-are-there\\" feeling with at least those images coming out of the screen was simply \\"not-there\\".  Nothing popped out of the screen and I was sitting with proper alignment to the screen.<br /><br />Somehow, one could see that flat images were layered.  Character eye contact is off.  In several scenes where characters which would talk to one another, the talker's eye contact seemed like he/she was looking at the listener's side.  Well, of coarse that's where the ear is, but most human beings still provide eye-contact and they let the sound waves do the hearing function.<br /><br />Another reason I wouldn't recommend this 3-D version: Simply too long of a movie while wearing 3-D glasses.<br /><br />There are good scenes, I must say.  The Grand Staircase from balcony to lower level was awesome.<br /><br />My equipment used is moderately new, both last year's (2011) with high regard.  The entertainment was watched with a Sony XBR and Oppo's best BDP-95.  I've seen great results with other materiel using this same setup.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this movie, though.  Experience.  Now, I'm not looking forward to the Star Wars reproductions.  Thanks to Titanic 3-D herein, I'll now look forward to something else better.  I'm sure that if a 1997 movie didn't work, a 1977 definitely won't!  In a way, I could understand that producer's wanting to make changes, however silly they may be.  The fans sometimes oppose the producer's changes.  For instance, there are people who don't believe in colorization on a black & white movie or television show for historical preservation.  Honestly, I consider colorization an improvement.  I think better they worry about 3-D conversions.<br /><br />This Titanic movie was meant to be seen in 2-D, period.  Save your eyes!
B005KCGIUY|5.0|I don't think it's exactly fair to say that Puscifer as a band is evolving.  A more honest way of looking at Puscifer is that this project isn't entirely sure what it is or what it wants to be.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  More so than any of Maynard's other side projects (and more so than most other bands that I'm familiar with) an album by Puscifer will give you a number of dimensions that some may find jarring as a whole.  Rest assured, all of the pieces are in the right place.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B002U6QSM6 \\"V\\" Is for Vagina]], Conditions of my Parole doesn't always take itself seriously.  Some songs appear heavily influenced by rock, others by country or electronic music.  Many defy easy categorization.  I would recommend starting with Man Overboard, Conditions of My Parole, The Green Valley, and The Weaver.  They should give you an idea of what this album could be about, and what this album is capable of.<br /><br />Puscifer continues to be something unique, that apparently shares little in common with either Tool or A Perfect Circle.  If you are already a fan of this album and you haven't picked up a copy of \\"V\\", I would highly recommend it.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|By the time \\"Vibration and Light Suite\\" had entered the cosmic sock-hop, I was seeing a tremendous array of rich colors and definitive textures...<br /><br />The gnome-like wizardry at eleven, and the owl pointing across to him from the one...<br /><br />A one-eyed bearded wonder sits at the five, his glances unwelcomed and noticably rejected by the yarn-spun haired, long-fingered maiden rolling her eyes near the seven...<br /><br />Within the inner circle and around the sun lie the signs of the zodiac...each one majestic in beauty: triumphantly confident, chiseled in stature and exhuding an unmistakeable look of relaxed content...<br /><br />Freak California rides on. Sceptre staff in hand, pointed to the sky and leading toward the wind blown direction up ahead.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I recentlty bought Catching Fire for my Kindle Fire and I am enjoying it tremendoulsy. I would give it 5 stars. It is action packed and has some humor in it. The author has a way of making you feel like you are right there.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Ever since the 1980's ended, ZZ Top have never quite abandoned the synthesized boogie blues that dominated the trio of albums they had out during that decade, during the commercial peak of their popularity. They have attempted to return back to their earlier blues roots, and occasionally inject the groove into the mix without the synthesizer, and most of the time, they have fallen short due to a lack of strong hooks.<br /><br />On 2012's \\"La Futura,\\" the hooks have returned, and the band sounds fierce and immediate, The leadoff track \\"Gotsta Get Paid\\" is a re-working of a hip hop classic (but it sounds remarkably like the ZZ Top of old). \\"Chartreuse\\" combines the groove of \\"Tush\\" with the pop sensibilities of \\"Sharp Dressed Man.\\" The track \\"Flyin High\\" sounds like a hybrid of classic ZZ Top with AC/DC, and it actually works.<br /><br />The slower blues ballads are nice, but a bit too frequent on the album and do slow the pacing down somewhat. But the focus and strength of this band was always when they were willing to attack a straightforward rocker, such as \\"Consumption.\\" Overall, it's great to have these guys back, and \\"La Futura\\" represents a nice comeback from a band who many thought were past their prime.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]<br /><br />Even if this book was a work of fiction and the characters were figments of the author's imagination, it would be an exceptional work of literature. The fact that it outlines the most significant event in the last 10 years and written by someone that actually participated, makes this a must read for anyone.<br /><br />Attention to detail without all of the boring technical jargon that often is beyond the (civilian) person's level of understanding or caring, is a big plus factor for this book. Although the story line is fast paced, I never felt lost or confused. I was at the edge of my seat from the moment I picked it up until the very end. I found that it was hard to slow it down to catch my breath.<br /><br />A five star rating for this book is not enough, and it's author should be commended for his participation, his diligence and his dedication. Thank you Mark Owen, (or whatever your name is) for this book and your selfless service to the American people.

The movie went along with books very closely, very few changes were made. (When books are so well written they decide to make it into a movie, why change anything in the first place?!) Loved it!

B003V5CFV8|4.0|What a hoot, this was, and is destined I believe, if it is not already, to become a classic. Anyone who likes Clooney and Goodman will surely enjoy this film. There are so many memorable lines, not quite Monty Python quotable, but close.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I like Nick Cage in almost all of the movies he has done.  He is a first rate actor.  After having seen the first Ghost Rider, it was a no brainer to pick up the sequel.  The movie is action packed with a great story line and I liked it better than the original.  For those wanting a demonic type movie - this is a good one.  Not recommended for kids under 13 as it can stir up some nightmares. Hope there is a 3rd one =)
0307949508|4.0|I liked this book better than the first part (many reviewers here, however, found the first book the better one).<br /><br />One will learn of Salander's family history: who her father and mother are, and why she was committed to an asylum. This is an action packed book, and very political in nature. It is also a page turner, and will keep you on edge. Is Salander a murderer? Is she the guilty party in this story, but pretending to be the innocent one? Who is Salander really? These questions, and many more, will keep you reading late at night, and will draw you closer to Salander (I don't want to spoil the story so don't want to give any hints).<br /><br />I was really intrigued at the opening of this novel. Salander is intrigued by Fermat's Last Theorem. I studied this mathematical conundrum in my early years, and was really fascinated by it. I read books about it, and admittingly even tried my hand at solving it. Why did the author choose that particular mathematical riddle as the opening of his second book? Was the author also intrigued by this formulae? I was so intrigued, and so drawn to Salander that I just couldn't put the book down. I found something that united me strongly with Salander, and her character quickly started to grow on me.<br /><br />Authors try to create characters that we can associate with, and such characters are usually the believable ones, and the ones that come alive. Though I wasn't really drawn towards Salander in the first book, the second book did the trick. Sometimes it takes a small and trivial think for a reader to associate himself with a character. If the author can succeed in that he has won over the reader.<br /><br />I like the writing style of the author, and his knowledge of politics and of men in power. This book is a real joy to read.<br /><br />As a side note: Some reviewers noted grammatical errors and sentence fragments in the book. This trilogy was written in Swedish, and then translated into English. We cannot thus judge the grammatical accuracy of this book based on the translation. The grammatical faults could very well be those of the translator.udge the grammatical accuracy of this book based on the translation.

0307454568|5.0|This is really the best book in the Millenium Trilogy (the books just keep getting better, with the second book better than the first). I felt closer to Salander, and felt I knew her better. The best parts of the book take place in the courtroom. If you are a fan of courtroom drama, then you will love this book (in some editions, this third book in the trilogy is named The Trial).<br /><br />This book picks up where the second ends, and feels very much like a part of the second one (the first and second book did not have this continuity).<br /><br />As in book 2, this book will keep you on edge and reading late at night. This is the longest of the three books in the Millenium Trilogy, so be prepared for many long nights. I don't want to spoil the book for you, but the story starts with Salander in the hospital, and the preparations for her trial. Is she guilty of murders? And why do some people want her dead?<br /><br />I liked the chemistry between Salander and Blomkvist, and the reader will be left unsure of Salander's real feelings towards Blomkvist. This is not the usual heroine falls in love with the hero. Theirs is a very complex relationship, and one that will keep the reader unsure with whom to sympathize. Only great writers can create such complicated characters.<br /><br />I am sad that this is the last book of this great series. I heard that the author intended this series to consist of nine books, but his untimely death put a stop to this project. A fourth book is partly completed, and I wonder whether another author will take the task of completing it and give us a fourth book in this captivating series. Salander and Blomkvist, and all the other characters, might still be alive!
B004LWZW8I|1.0|This movie would be perfect for SyFy channel. It is horrible. Lame , Lame, Lame. The characters were ridiculous, storyline and costumes are even worse. I was begging for the movie to end.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Great movie - especially for fathers & families facing challenging times. The characters are well developed, and the plot moves along well... keeping your attention from beginning to end, without being too action packed. Caution for younger children (including teens): There is a little gang initiation scene in the middle of the movie that might give kids a bad role-model to reflect on. This is a good movie to watch WITH your teen kids, because invariably there will be some good conversations that could come from watching it.
1401324649|4.0|Jonasson cleverly combines modern world history, pop culture, crime/mystery and a bit of western story telling (Swedish style) into this fun filled adventure of an old man on the run from stagnation (and the partners-in-crime he met along the way). Tales are best told, afterall, when it is interspersed with intrigue and humor. I personally prefer this flavor of Swedish fiction, and I take away one star for an occasional historical absurdity which leaves a bland taste of the author's own prejudice and ignorance on the palate of discerning readers.
0061122416|3.0|Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is an irritating, yet thought-provoking book about a boy chasing his dream across the desert to fulfill his Personal Legend. Coelho's story is chock-full of words to live by and life philosophies, but I feel like he did not stick to one point and make it known. The author often contradicts his own words, and repeats himself too much, as if he did not think he could get it in the reader's head the first time. The book doesn't seem terribly well written or well thought out. While I did not like the book, I can certainly see why one would call this a good book, and why it would be called a bad book.<br />  The author makes some amazing comparisons to the various religions that Santiago encounters throughout the course of this story. He cites the Koran and the Bible, while also making references to Buddhism and other deity's. He also talks about a Soul of the World. I only believe in one of them, but the information gathered about the other beliefs makes the story enjoyable.<br />  The book also made me as a person reflect on my life. Socrates said, \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\" That is what makes this a good book. It makes me think about my life. After reading this I still think, \\"Am I living my life to the best that I can? Am I following my own Personal Legend?\\" Also, the wording sounded very poetic at times, and helped to get his points across.<br />  However, the book was unbearable at times. Around every corner in this novel, there is a, \\"how to live your life\\" lesson crammed up my nasal passages and embedded into my brain. Coelho seemed to be trying way to hard to make his book into some sort of inspirational work, which sacrificed a lot of the book's meaning. It made the flow sound choppy and poorly written.<br />  The storyline was not great, either. Santiago's decisions were never well thought out, and generally he just did what was told of him, by whomever told him so. No boy could ever go through what he did, and have all of those beliefs and ideas thrown at him and still stay so mentally set that he is a Christian. And that is proven when he needs help. He did not directly pray to his God, like a Christian would, he asked through a Soul of the World, and that bothered me as a Christian. The plot was unrealistic and unreasonable.<br />  Is this is a good book? I did not like it or enjoy it, but it made me think differently and deeply, and that is what I expect of a good book.all of those beliefs and ideas thrown at him and still stay so mentally set that he is a Christian.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|First of all, this story needed to be told and is very well told by the authors.  I do not understand how anyone could give it less than five stars.  It will make a terrific movie.<br /><br />Secondly, I believe a lot of the criticism stems from the fact that the Pentagon was not given the opportunity to censor the book before publication, but honestly I saw nothing that should be kept secret from our enemies. The Pentagon  probably would have butchered the text. Given the coverage of the bin Laden raid elsewhere, there are no secrets left to tell.<br /><br />Thirdly, the honesty of the authors comes through.<br /><br />Finally, a portion of the revenues from the sale of the book is going to charities which help veterans and their families.

0525953728|4.0|Whether the Seal was right or wrong in writing this book is not the point that I will address...You are reading this because you are thinking about purchasing the book - so here's my opinion. I found it a captivating, easy and compelling read, there were no \\"HOLY SHEET\\" moments, everything in the book you can probably find on Google BUT the difference was the raid was told from his point of view..<br /><br />For example, we all know what happened on 9/11, we can tell the story BUT the story will never be told like it can be told by a person who ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED IT and that's what you have here within this book.<br /><br />This is one Seal's story about the raid that killed Bin Laden, he was there, he was the second man in, you learn about the things that went wrong, the elements that went into the planning, the luck they had and didn't have coupled with the personal life that's impacted by being a Seal. I think everyone should read this book, and realize that right or wrong, these Seals dedicate and in some instances give up their lives so we can sit in the comfort of our living rooms and debate the pros and cons of whether this book should have been written, don't get caught up in the political comments,or the \\"shoulda, coulda, woulda\\" of whether he did right or wrong in writing the book because until YOU are willing to die to ATTEMPT to get Bin Laden without knowing if you would succeed or not , then you have no right to criticize him.<br /><br />Short review and comment:<br />Definitely worth the money, we all should read it and God Bless our Military

B0058O84G0|5.0|If you enjoy sweeping historical novels, then this is the book for you.  Following several characters, this novel takes them from the years 1911 to the early 1920's and looks at their involvement in many vast historical events - such as WWI, the suffragettes, the beginnings of National Socialism in Germany and the Russian revolution.  The story begins in a Welsh mining village and incorporates both the mining families, the local aristocracy and then moves on to German and American diplomats, Russian princesses and peasants and also real characters such as Winston Churchill, Lenin and Trotsky, who are incorporated into the storyline.<br /><br />I have long been a fan of Ken Follett and in the first part of this trilogy he has weaved a wonderful cast of characters that we care about.  Ethel, who begins the book as a maid and ends it as a Member of Parliament, Fitz, her former employer, his sister Maud and her German husband, Grigori and Lev, Russian brothers who take very different paths and the other characters and strands of the story.  The next book in the trilogy is [[ASIN:B007FEFLTO Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy]] and I look forward to seeing what lies ahead for the characters in the first book and their children.  This is a wonderful and satisfying book, which I recommend highly.

B00845PV16|1.0|This sequel is probably one of the worst movies I have seen in many years. Production value is horrible, acting, (or overacting for Mr Cage) is non existing. Stopped the movie after the first hour, that is how horrible and embarrising this movie is. Do not spend your hard earned money on this disaster.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I use this<br /><br />'Apps Organizer' is done by the same person & I thought nothing came close to it,<br />but this is more 'powerful' to use... especially the feature of able to have 'sub groups' inside 'groups'<br /><br />Took a while experimenting to discover HOW to do certain things... but now it's 2nd nature
B002VRZEYM|2.0|I agree that most of what is in this film needs to be said.  However, it needs to be said in a different manner.  The film ignores many of the realities of mass farming.  For example, there is a cattle farmer in the film who is proud that he produces organic meat but then states that he doesn't care how far people have to travel to get it.  In essence, he ignores that cattle production (and most other food production) is done in the Plain states for cost and/or climate reasons.  Raising the amount of cattle in the northeast (and other populated areas) where land is expensive and more densely populated, is most likely not a reality.  While I'd like to be proven otherwise, I was hoping the documentary would be more comprehensive on this obvious point.<br /><br />Additionally, there are many leaps of faith in the film that you would have if you were to accept it at face value.  For example, much of the narrative of the film relies on the filmmaker himself reciting facts without referencing any source(s).  Or, as another example, the mother who tragically lost her son to E. Coli refers to two other recent deaths without citing a source of the illnesse.  Outbreaks of E. Coli have been linked to a number of sources, although the film suggests it is mainly the cause of runoff from cattle.  This makes the film seem very impartial and opens it up to much criticism.  I really wanted the film to support the views I already had, but all I could think of is how other people would view this film as a flimsy attack.
B00843TZJM|4.0|My mom and I had just gone to see CSN in concert, so it was nice to get this DVD right after we saw them live.  They sounded fine after all these years, and even though they didn't perform Suite: Judy Blue Eyes when we saw them live, they did on this DVD.  It was worth it just for that.  I think they were doubtful that they could do some of these songs, and it was touching to see how the younger band members supported them.  If you love CSN, you will love this DVD.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|What about a sushi restaurant could possibly grab a viewer's attention for the better part of an hour and a half? It's not the food that captivates an audience, it's the man behind the magic, Jiro. For starters, the 85 year old Jiro runs his restaurant with the most impossibly high standards of cleanliness, taste, and presentation. So high are his standards, that it takes any of his chefs in training 10 years to master what I would call his \\"art.\\"<br /><br />But digging deeper into his discipline (perhaps in Western civilization, obsessiveness), we find that he rolls each piece of sushi individually just seconds before it's enjoyed by his patrons; all the while compensating his serving size for women/men, placing the pieces of sushi on plates depending on the dominant hand of each patron, and scrutinizing the size of each piece of fish he serves. He is ninja-like in his dedication to the art of sushi-making and considers it more of a lifestyle, a mindset really, than he does a job. If you happen to make it to Japan, the minimum $375 and one month advanced reservation it takes to get into Jiro's sushi restaurant would absolutely be worth it...if nothing else but for the experience alone.<br /><br />It's rare to find a film that so perfectly compliments its subject matter with its camerawork and sequencing. Please spend the few bucks to check out this rental--you can gain a new life perspective for $3, which is about as cheap as they come.
0061537969|4.0|Whether or not we admit it, most of us would undoubtedly be interested in hearing what a dog had to say, if it were only possible. Thus The Art of Racing in the Rain was born.<br /><br />Author Garth Stein gives us Enzo, a highly intelligent canine who is first adopted as a puppy by a young man he adores. When Denny soon after meets Eve and falls in love, quickly getting married and producing baby Zoe, Enzo is filled with a mix of love and jealousy, having to share Denny with others.<br /><br />All his life, Denny has dreamed of a career in racing. Thus, it becomes Enzo's dream as well. He becomes quite the expert on the subject, learning from Denny as the two watch old race videos together, and Enzo relays an impressive font of knowledge to readers.<br /><br />Yet before too long, tragedy strikes the small family. Heartbroken, Enzo is powerless to do much other than watch what unfolds, hoping against all hopes that everything will turn out all right in the end.<br /><br />Of course, much of this story is a bit of a stretch -- particularly Enzo's intelligence, which quite possibly exceeds that of many people in our midst. But it's still enjoyable, and readers will find it difficult not to shed a few tears before it's through.

B008WCP2KG|1.0|Never in my life had I walked out of a movie, until this one. Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen. Aside from the fact that it's a movie targeted are dryed up, horny, old women, the movie's plot and story was terrible. Some people I was with stuck around and finished watching it (dont know how they did it) and they filled me in on what I missed which was essentially nothing. Kid becomes a stripper, kid begins selling drugs and ruins his life, while Channing Tatum's character quits stripping. What a waste of money!!!!

B004H88VUM|2.0|I like the movie \\"Town\\", I think it's one of Ben Affleck's best efforts.  This review is about the streaming quality.<br /><br />1)  Please Amazon create some software that allows streaming customers a practical search method for finding and storing titles they'd like to see. Please do this for Prime and nonPrime titles.  Your're so far behind Netflix, it's not even funny.<br /><br />2)  Streaming quality was pretty bad in spots with noticeable pixallation.  True, this could be my less than adequate dsl, but then again, I never have this problem with Netflix.<br /><br />Amazon, you're so good at everything else that these streaming problems are really unbearable, you cannot act soon enough to clean up your act in this regard.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Let me start by saying that Mr. Ryan has the potential to be a truly great author. He has the storytelling and character development down pat, and his style of writing is unique. That being said, this book was lacking in one area that I most of the time can completely ignore: grammar. Having a few typos is expected, but when I am forced to slow down my reading to go back and re-read sentences every other page I find it somewhat irritating and detracting from the quality of the book.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great fantasy novel, I have no qualms about recommending this 100%. All I ask is that Mr. Ryan employ some starving English graduate as an editor for his next release.
0757302661|4.0|I found out this book pretty far in to my pregnancy and my daughter arrived early, about a week after I finished reading the book, but I can say, without reservation, that the information I learned, just by reading the book one time and practicing with my husband twice, that it was a great help while I was in labor.  I was not without pain, but I was very calm and in control.  I just wish I had had more time to practice the techniques!
B007ZEG3Q4|4.0|Early reviewers who deemed this film \\"Heat with a Boston accent\\" clearly missed a great deal of the subtlety, inflection, and sheer artisanship of The Town. It's actually a highly original piece of work-- a crackling crime thriller with a very cleverly developed script, gritty authenticity, and terrific performances from all hands, especially Rebecca Hall and the late great Peter Postlewaite. Indeed it's the second time that Affleck has taken a beach-read book and constructed a better, more resonant film from it (the first was his underrated debut Gone Baby Gone, based on a Dennis Lehane formula mystery).<br /><br />On to the details of this edition:<br /><br />This Blu-Ray version contains most of the same extras as the non Blu-Ray Special Edition-- a disc worth of vignettes that focus on the making of the film. As is typical of films that veer from a central truth in the interest of art, one theme explored is a sort of backhanded apologia: there's a glancing acknowledgement that the Boston neighborhood Charlestown (The Town of the title) is no longer the hotbed of highly skilled bank robbers it was in the Fifties and Sixties.<br /><br />Technical Notes: Visually, it's a dark film , with a very urban look, so the benefits of added detail take effort to find. The Blu Ray resolution gave me some plot details I had not discerned earlier: in the nuns-with-guns armored car robbery, you can now see gas cans in the rear seat, evidence that the thieves need to torch the getaway vehicle, and are willing to risk self-immolation to assure that trace evidence is consumed.<br /><br />What is here is an alternate ending that is darker, cleverly interlaced with subplots developed early in the film, and far more faithful to the book, albeit slightly overtold by an unnecessary \\"summing up\\" fake news report. Oddly enough, the central theme of The Town is little changed by the changed outcome: bad deeds, even those that predate a moral redemption, still have consequences.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00466HN72|2.0|I purchased this item 6 months ago but am just now watching the blu-ray disc for the first and the bottom of the screen is flickering. I read the back of the box and said made in Mexico maybe that's why the quality is so poor. The dvd disc works fine and that's what we've been using. If I would have known I would get a bad quality blu-ray from amazon I would have saved my money and just bought the dvd. I've bought plenty of blu-ray discs from amazon before so I really disappointed to get a bad disc since I've had such great history with them till now.
0061122416|2.0|Pablo Coelho's The Alchemist uses hidden lessons and incomprehensible passages to bring an interesting story down to demise.<br /><br />The story starts off fresh giving new life and story to Santiago, a poor sheppard boy. Paulo sends him off on an exciting adventure promising treasure and hidden lessons that are hard to understand. The first road bump in the story begins when the King of Salem gives him Urimm and Thurimm, these stones are supposed to help Santiago in his quest for the treasure of the pyramids but provide the story with no significance and also difficult philosophical meaning that does nothing to help the fable. These additions to the fable offer complexity that the book didn't need.<br /><br />More hidden messages arrive later in the book like \\"The Soul of the World\\" and the \\"Language of the World\\" although these ideas introduced into the book provoke thought they add un-needed complexity to a simple adventure for treasure. By the end of the fable Paulo Coelho has layered the book with his secret meanings that the story has become incomprehensible. Turning into the wind is Santiago's final challenge. As these events took place the story and meanings that Paulo was trying to teach fell apart.<br /><br />What was an interesting fable and an exciting adventure crumbled into pieces as Paulo added unnecessary meanings and passages.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|After watching two episodes of this on rental, I was totally hooked and knew I needed to own it!  Amazon shipped it to me super fast, which was a great relief. I received it within a few days (Thanks Amazon!!)<br /><br />I should say I usually do not get so excited over television (even HBO) but this series is really different and remarkable. It is sort of like Lord of the Rings meets Sopranos meets Arthurian legends, plus Barbarian warfare, evil scheming, romance, wolves, forests, ancient gods, and phenomenal cinematography all rolled into one. This series is violent and explicit -- NOT for children. But don't write it off as just blood and sex -- there are touching scenes of friendship, much loyalty and compassion, deep human relationships.  VERY well acted.<br /><br />The story is slow moving and slowly revealed, full of surprises and intrigue. Be alert!  You will like to watch it more than once. The special features are excellent also. A great buy and a must for all fans of fantasy.

0061122416|4.0|So, maybe one could say The Alchemist by Mister Paulo Coelho shows certain characteristics with those of a cupcake. Wait, before you do anything, let me explain myself.<br /><br />Not to make you hungry, but when you eat a cupcake, one with icing and sprinkles, you don't always get a sprinkle when you take a bite, right? And, one time, you may get two, then one. So in my little metaphor, those sprinkles are Coelho's simplest ideas. Sometimes they go right over your head and then, when you re-read the book - bang! - the ideas just snap and you get it. And Coelho has just lightly dusted the icing, but, I tell you, those sprinkles are delicious; the ideas just wonderful.<br /><br />The book's \\"icing\\" is the story's symbolism. Someone else may call it a thick layer of unrealistic goodness, something to be expected in a fable, but I just call it \\"symbolism\\". There is so much in this book to catch on to that sometimes, you just can't keep up. But, re-reading will fix that.<br /><br />And then, in the middle, there is the filling (of the cupcake), just a bit. That is the truth that is to be found in the main character's journey, the truth to be found in all the lessons and morals, all of it.<br /><br />Sometimes, though, you don't want to eat the cupcake. So, I will confess the downside of this book. In my opinion - all respect to Paulo Coelho - I saw the characters as stick figures. Or, at best, they were half finished human beings, meaning that they seemed to be Mary Sues and the male counterparts. For those of you that don't know what that means, I'll save you a trip to Google. Mary Sues are underdeveloped and don't really have any flaws. And if they do, those flaws are not nearly noticeable. They exist to just flow down the plot-river and \\"primarily function as a wish-fulfillment fantasy for the author or reader\\": (Wikipedia).<br /><br />The plot and problems I saw as symbolism, as I said, but I don't think the characters were symbolic overall. I also thought the book's ending was thrown together and not properly planned out.

B008KRJWEK|4.0|Pretty simple game, but fun, easy and free to play.  Your score is literally the distance you drive.  Tilt the Kindle Fire from side to side to avoid obstacles and smash into (most)mutants to get in game money.  Spend your in game 'money' to buy weapon upgrades or new vehicles or powerups.  There are also other items that you can purchase for 'real money'.  I really like that after downloading the game you can still play without having an active Wi-Fi connection, but all the Glu games I have played are like that.<br /><br />  I have not found how to change the screen orientation for this game.  The default(and maybe only) orientation is with the narrow end being the bottom (narrow screen as opposed to wide screen view ). I have had it 'lock up' my kindle on 2 separate occasions and had the game slow down once.  Considering how many times I have played the game(a lot) the rare lock up and freeze is barely worth knocking off a star for this free game.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|This album is growing on me like wildflowers.  After about 10 listens I can safely say that I think it's his best since his 1997 album, \\"Time Out Of Mind.\\"  It's an approach he's been trying to perfect since Love and Theft, unless you look at Together Through Life as a slight departure from that like I do.  Highlights to me include: Tin Angel, Narrow Way, Scarlet Town, Pay In Blood, Early Roman Kings, and the title track.  It may not be for everybody out there, but I think most Dylan fans will be very pleased with Tempest after a few listens.  Grows on you.  Love it.  In some ways I think Dylan has found his true voice on Tempest.  Fantastic lyrics, catchy rhythms, and entrancing blood dripping ballads.  Dylan has turned into sort of a god on Tempest.  What an album!  My favorite release this year by far.  I hope you learn to like it as much as I do.  Thanks for reading and happy listening out there.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. It's written in a easy reading way, so I could read in the bus and while boring classes effortlessly.

I'd like my daughter to find inspiration on Katniss instead of Bella

B007XU0N1G|5.0|Is this a Rhapsody album or a Luca Turilli album? These two names have become so synonymous over the years as to be virtually inseparable. Even during Luca's solo career I wondered why he decided to strike out on his own since his first two albums could easily have been placed under the Rhapsody catalog, both musically and lyrically. His last solo album, however, was a drastic change that would not have fit so comfortably and now that Luca has split with the \\"of Fire\\" crew that direction has come back with a vengeance.<br /><br />This new Rhapsody is truly a force to be reckoned with, and just a few listens to this masterpiece will surely convince anyone that this iteration is the real deal. To be fair, I shouldn't dismiss Staropoli and crew since they have yet to put forth their new album and I am convinced those guys are competent at writing amazing music as well, but let me just say that Luca has set bar really high with Ascending to Infinity.<br /><br />The new singer, Alessandro Conti, is a far cry from Fabio Lione, as Conti is a schooled tenor and shows off his impressive range very frequently. Far from showboating, Conti is literally a breath of fresh air, combining a somewhat typical but very well done register of power metal singing ala Michael Kiske with his tenor background, and quite frequently under the same breath, which is a really unique dichotomy that I can't recall hearing in any other band. Conti also visits a mid range regularly, which is lower than his main voice, reminding me of a less cheesy and much manlier Rob Rock and is exemplified superbly in Dark Fate of Atlantis. This lower register is actually quite soothing on the ears, giving off an operatic feel and making the transition into his tenor range more sinuous. To be honest, I can't recall being this impressed by a power metal singer since Oliver Hartmann and Matthias Blad, and it's this versatility that has helped Luca explore the creative freedom he desired.<br /><br />Indeed, one could almost say that Luca was held back by the \\"other\\" Rhapsody. Lione, though very good, does not have the same range as Conti, and the fantasy themes, as Luca has expressly stated, did not match the lyrical freedom he desired (even if it seemed Luca ironically held himself back when he went solo, writing fantasy based lyrics as well). One doesn't have to go far into the album to make this realization, either; the first full track, which happens to be the title track, is one of Rhapsody's best songs to date, boasting enthusiastic choruses and a soaring performance by Conti who shows off his vocal mettle with tremendous gusto. Impressive is certainly an understatement, and it foreshadows the grandiose ideas jammed onto this single disc. At no moment does the music ever sound cluttered or pretentious; Luca's experience has been distilled over the years, his creativity liberated yet directed clearly and eloquently. This is indeed the work of a master artist who knows exactly which strokes to paint and colors to use.<br /><br />While the title track, Dark Fate of Atlantis, and Clash of the Titans are more traditional Rhapsody songs in terms of composition and layout, other songs such as Tormento e Passione are a bit more divergent, taking on a theatric quality, complete with two characters exchanging dialogue, a strong emphasis on Conti's tenor range, and lyrics written entirely in Italian. Its placement smack dab in the middle of the track order implies an \\"intermission\\" of sorts, to shake things up, as well as the interesting cover of Alessandro Safina's Luna, which I would've preferred at the end of the album, actually, since that is technically a \\"popera\\" song and breaks the momentum just ever so slightly, despite Rhapsody's arrangement being more metal.<br /><br />Another surprise is the relative lack of spoken words, or within the context of a Rhapsody album, narrative. Christopher Lee may have done a good job on past albums but I've never been a fan of two to threeminute narratives before the final track or 45-60 seconds of talking in the middle of a track. As important to the story as it may be, I find it breaks the momentum and cheapens the album, but FINALLY Luca has found a happy medium. His new narrator doesn't even get a cumulative minute of air time, the longest span occurring on (you guessed it) the last track and even then it's a mere 30 seconds in length. And the good news is that he doesn't even sound that bad; this time it's the somewhat cheesy dialogue that stands out. Indeed, Luca has apparently forgotten what fillers are and written an album that is 100% awesome 100% of the time.<br /><br />Up until now Dawn of Victory had been my favorite album from Rhapsody but Ascending to Infinity surpasses it easily. It combines the bombast and orchestral emphasis of earlier albums with the aggression of Power of the Dragonflame, and magnifies everything tenfold. True, it may still bear Luca's stylistic leaning and in that sense there hasn't been a tremendous amount of forward movement, but that doesn't mean the music hasn't improved or is no longer relevant. Luca's trademark style is merely the backbone. It's how he evolves that style to fit changing tastes and influences that matters, incorporating new themes and musical elements that were previously unfeasible and at the same time staying true to himself and to his fans.

0525953728|1.0|Matthew Bissonnette (a nom de plume for Mark Owen), of Wrangell, Alaska, deliberately compromised the security of the USA by publishing his tell-all history on the assassination of Usama bin Laden. As many papers reported, Marine Col. Tim Nye, a Special Operations Command spokesman, said the author \\"put himself in danger\\" by writing the book entitle \\"No Easy Day\\", and endangered the lives of other SEALs who went with him. Al-Qaida vows to kill Bissonnette and his colleagues in retaliation for his murder of bin Laden.    The publisher, Penguin Group, claims that Bissonnette \\"was one of the first men through the door on the third floor of the terrorist leader's hideout and was present at his death.\\" This assertion has no substantiation. The Los Angeles Times detailed Bissonnette to be a coward, using Bissonnette's own words that \\"[Bin Laden] had no intention of fighting.  Bin Laden carried no weapon.\\"    Bissonnette notes that the al-Qaeda leader stuck his head out of the door with no weapon in sight. This action flaunts every rule of law and the Geneva Convention that forbids any political assassination if the subject was unarmed or refused to fight.  This error, one of many factual inaccuracies, is corrected by his colleagues who wrote that after that there was \\"bad blood\\" between them in their Kindle Book \\"No Easy Op\\" sold through Amazon.    Bissonnette's lack of honesty appears in his ridicule of Vice President as if he had personal familiarity with Joe Biden--a man he never met. He says little about the Commander-in-Chief who ultimately was responsible for the action, but implies that Barrack Obama had nothing to do with the raid or the assault.    In his discussion of the assault, Bissonnette used confidential, highly classified information which has led the military to investigation as to what crimes were committed and what sensitive information was leaked to al-Qaeda. He did hire an attorney to go over the manuscript, but the barrister is not a legal expert.While Bissonnette states that Obama was \\"indecisive\\", White House and Pentagon documents show the opposite.  It was Obama who initiated and commandeered the maneuvering to kill bin Laden--if bin Laden put up a resistance.    Bissonnette says nothing about the model of the compound that Obama gave instructions to be built.  He says nothing about Obama giving the order to invade the compound. Gen. James \\"Hoss\\" Cartwright, Obama's then-No. 2 military adviser reported that the President, rather than scaling back the scope of the bin Laden raid, the President ordered more choppers to go on the operation.  According to Admiral Mike Mullen (then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of the Staff), \\"Obama is the one that put in the Chinook-47s. He [Obama] is the one that said, `There is not enough backup.'\\" None of this is in the book.    There are those critics of the review who claim that I never read the book.  What the critics forget is that the publisher sends pre-publication reviews to professional reviewers--and pre-publication reviews usually have typographical errors--but not in details.  The problem for me is the details, as I was taught that no single book would contain all the truth, as all books are slanted.  To claim that his books is a bible of fact is a lie in both instances, as the book is countered by the Kindle Book \\"No Easy Op\\" and the bible is applicable only to those who believe in it (either the Torah and Prophets that make up the Old Testament that many Jews accept, or the Constantinian New Testament that contains only four out of several hundred gospels and the spurious writings of Paul who never lived nor stated any evidence of education outside of studying in the synagogue).  I prefer the scientific method: seek out all printed material and read it (research), then look for supporting evidence (investigation) that includes photographs, schematics, and interviews, etc.  \\"No Easy Day\\" misses this, much in the same way as the books by David Barton of Texaswho claims -- without any formal education -- to be an historian of the USA--a title and designation that all serious scholars have rejected.  Barton's histories are very much like Bissonnette's account. The book implies that Bissonnette was in command. The book reads as if Bissonnette was a patriot and hero. A patriot does what is best for the nation and its rule of law,  A hero does not endanger those around him but works to protect each individual.  Bissonnette does not qualify for either title.    The book is fantasy at best, and fraud in reality.  It is for that reason the Navy and the Pentagon are looking to the book to see what charges might be brought against Matthew Bissonnette.  The US Supreme Court has ruled against discharged and retired military who wrote books exposing confidential information as in the case of Frank W. Snepp, III v. United States. United States v. Frank W. Snepp, III. 444 US 507 (100 S.Ct. 763, 62 L.Ed.2d 704) decided February 19, 1980. [...].  Bissonnette is not out of danger, both from al-Qaeda and from military justice.  This book only serves to further his self-destruction.    Today we know that Bissonnette hoped to market to Hollywood.  His team discussed what star would play which SEAL.  To this end Bissonnette spoke with Steven Spielberg on a movie of his alleged exploits.    \\"No Easy Day\\" merits no stars.  Bissonnette merits less, but the co-author did give the book some polish and made it readable. I put my pre-publication copy in my library in the fiction section.
0061122416|3.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a slow novel that is a collision of ideas creating a confusing yet inspiring story which forces the reader to take one sentence at a time. The story had many lessons to be learned which addresses general people, but rereading these lessons to fully grasp their meaning is a common habit from page one. Though the story lacked excitement, I found a certain entertainment when I was able to reflect on my own life when deeper meanings were revealed. The saying I got the most personal thought out of was right towards the start of the novel. Coelho said \\"Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should live their lives, but none about his or her own.\\" Before this was said, I wanted to give up reading out of boredom but when I began to learn how to find the lessons meant to be learned, I enjoyed the book that much more.<br /><br />  The hardest thing about this story for me though, was that so many conflicting ideas were put together. The combination of multiple religions was most prevalent. There were references from the Bible and about God, but then it would shift into another religion such as Muslim by referring to omens from Allah. I didn't particularly like that every religion became one because it made the story that much harder to follow.<br /><br />  This story started out as realistic novel until the end when the impossible idea of turning yourself into the wind became possible which continued to add to my list of colliding ideas. The story should have all been realistic or not because it would have been a nice constant element.<br /><br />  Overall The Alchemist is a novel you would want to read if you needed life inspiration but don't mind feeling a little lost along the way. That's how life is though; you learn and grow on the journey but getting to your destination can be messy. The destination doesn't always matter either and that's what the book really teaches. Though the story was confusing, in the aspect of important lessons learned, The Alchemist was worth reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game so much. it is so fun and very addictive I love how you can change the back ground and the cards to what ever you want the ads are kind of annoying
0061122416|2.0|The Alchemist was a well-rounded book with many pros and cons. It was written in third person as a narratives perspective. When a novel is written in third person it can either make the book or break it. In this case I felt as if it added to the cons list. When I first picked up the book to read it I was expecting it to be a non-fiction story, but when I dug deeper into this novel it turned out to be the opposite. The book was not realistic at all. Santiago (the main character) talked to the wind and at one point turned into it. He also had these two rocks that he kept in his pocket that would make his decisions for him.  I think that every person was given the gift of free will and that he should use that instead of having rocks decide his fate. Santiago never says no he always lets people just boss him around and tell him what his future holds.<br /><br />An honorable lesson throughout this novel is to follow your dreams no matter what life throws at you...even if it means being robbed multiple times. Some pros about The Alchemist whenever Santiago was about to turn his back on his \\"destiny\\" he would run into an individual that inspired him to keep going and to discover his true \\"destiny.\\" Another pro I thought was kind of adorable when he meets the love of his life, Fatima, Santiago thought that she was the treasure he was supposed to find. But instead at the end of the book he discovers his true destiny that was laid out for his life from the beginning.
B0088TG252|5.0|I have to write at least 20 words even though I don't want to write anything. I thought that this was a great movie...I enjoyed it very much. But my tastes may be 180 degrees out of line with yours. You may like it, you may hate it. I have absolutely no idea. If you like Ryan Reynolds and/or Denzel Washington, they are both at their best in this film. If you like political espionage/thrillers, this fits well within the genre and provides plenty of action and twists.
0425263908|4.0|A lot similar to Fifty Shades but a lot raunchier if you can believe it.  This book made me blush more than once. LOL All I have to say is YOWZA!!  The one negative thing I can say is that these characters are just so messed up, they have a ton of issues and the way they are with each other is just so over the top, especially Eva who freaks out about everything.  But nontheless it was a fun read and I'm totally going to read the rest of the books and have already suggested it to my friends.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I got Pink Floyd's The Wall in the mail, and I believe I ordered it Friday. But anyways, I loved this movie, I only saw it on Youtube, and I never got to finish it. I just finished watching it, and I must say it was pure genius. Every song was amazing, best hour and a half I've experienced in awhile, and I'm glad I got it at such a steal!! :D
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Not quite finished with this tome but I can say it is interesting if not disturbing. The author keeps me wanting to read more since he ends most sections without closure. I am hoping that in the end all will come together in a gigantic surprise
B00008H2LB|5.0|I don't care what tech n9ne has to say about real rock, for me, this is the pinnacle of rock perfection. Yes, rap rock, the genre that linkin park has left behind. This album is the reason why all the lp fans got mad at their new stuff. Don't be fooled, this is a 5 star album, under-hyped by the new fan-base (check out the new no doubt music and what the general consensus is to see what i mean!) And forgotten in time. There is no album that means more to me than meteora, never will be. It's about staying true to your roots, artistic, and some songs are just about being a young person in struggle. We can all relate to that. Every song is good, No filler, and All the lyrics are good. This is not hybrid theory part 2.This is LP at their prime, and sadly, they're never going back. Hell, Get this just for the art. Also has a video about how they made it... If you havent heard meteora you dont know the real Linkin Park...<br /><br />Don Gilmore pushed the band to do their best... They haven't done something this good lyrically or musically since. LP isn't dead for me. They live in the early 2000's.<br /><br />Enjoy
B001KWR3PM|5.0|Good listening from Eric Clapton. \\"Slow Hand\\" never disappoints, especially with this album. With so many hits, it's hard to pick a favorite. Tears in Heaven is a classic.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|Sublime aural poetry. Time has stood still for sculpturists of prescient and profound aural ambience. Liquid, locquacious, lilting and learned.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I loved the books and the movie left out a lot of emotional parts in the book that made you fall in love with the characters. Other then that the movie was just like the book. Hopefully they can put more about how Petta and Kat fall in love in the 2nd movie!!!
B001S86J1C|5.0|What else can you say, that hasn't already been said about this movie. A classic, hit, etc! There is nothing. Matthew Broderick and crew have done nothing short of amazing on this film. If you don't own, get it!

B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Every once in awhile I stumble across a puzzle game that grabs my brain and gives it a talking-to. This is one of those games.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />Every puzzle is a new challenge.<br />The graphics are good.<br />Spider and Fly movement is fluid.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />When I use a different ability (i.e. freeze) it doesn't automatically default back to the scissors<br />Sometimes, the touch controls feel off and my finger cuts the wrong web<br /><br />I love a good puzzle game on phones because there is no permanent commitment required in any given setting. In the car, during lunch, or on the john, I can attempt a puzzle or two and put my phone away. Also, these puzzle games that present a variety of different problems and solutions have a way of compelling me attempt and complete them all. Plus, the setting for the puzzles in this game is just more fun than other puzzle games out there and reminds of games like Cut the Rope or Where's my Water.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As a first time author on Kindle, I found this book to be extremely helpful. Now I need to use the information.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Music was good, Charlize was ok- her yelling got old very quickly, but she was gorgeous as the queen, Chris was ok-did the best he could for the character written - everything else did not care for.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart can not act , maybe it was telling since she didn't speak much during the movie. Since she was the title character one would think she would have more lines.- wonder if she was cast for the name / Twilight fans she would bring to the box office. The pacing of the movie was horrible, it dragged on and when there was an interesting scene it was rushed. There were animated fairies  which ruined the medieval  vibe it went for in the begnning.<br /><br />Movie had potential, but the acting, directing is painful<br /><br />Rent before you buy,- some people might love it, but dont waste money on the blu ray till you know you like it!<br /><br />*spoiler- the ending was not the best leaving room for sequel which is not guaranteed to happen- which just really made me dislike the movie more. If the ending was better would have went to two stars.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was a good book but I didn't like all the parts with war.  I must not have been in the mood for that.
B008602KQI|4.0|this was a great film as far as i was concerned but not a favorite of all the family. i would have given five star but because the fiancee totally didn't like it and mixed reviews of the three children i gave it a four star rating.
B008MM9630|4.0|Got this game for my daughter and she just loves it.  Great for keeping her busy and I like that it can be played offline.
1401322786|4.0|I found this book to be simple, an easy read but most importantly a warm, kind story about love.  Love for your partner, rejection, and the human condition.  We in so many ways are a broken species.  Love and so many emotions make us weak...but love also takes you to so many places.  I found this book to be filled with hope.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it made me hopeful at a time when I have been most down.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|There are alot of reviews already out there, but I have to say I went to the theater to see this one because I like comic book characters brought to life and I absolutely loved this movie. What I did not know at the time is this and several others were tying into the Avengers. Anyway I thought this movie was fantastic and seeing Chris Evans shrunk down to that small and sickly looking was amazing and it looked completely believable. Then when he stepped out of that chamber and was transformed to the absolutely ripped and super buff Cap it was something to behold. He pulls off looking like that and not being arrogant about it and he could easily act like that. He actually seems to be the wholesome and naive guy he portrays. I think he pulls it off because he is nice without being a pushover and it comes across in his acting(seen enough extra stuff to believe that, not just be a actor groupie). He is a great actor in my estimation. Hugo Weaving is always amazing in whatever he does. From Agent Smith to Megatron's voice to Red Skull he is a superb actor. I thought it was an interesting concept on how to get Captain America from the 1940's to current time. Some do not like it, but I did. I highly recommend this movie. It is entertaining and frankly the patriotism portrayed in this movie was refreshing to see. I am looking forward to the second Captain America movie in 2014.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this one cause I was tired of the cheap $4 ones from China. Let me tell you I'm extremely impressed with this one! I've never heard any hiss at all even when it's on pause. I forget this is a transmitter cause it sounds like a CD player. The sound is so clear! I love the features like the folders, hot swap and changing from USB to SD by the remote. The navigation is really simple and everything is on the display...the station you're using, the song, artist, time and location of the song on the SD card or USB device. There is only one small issue I have.....the prongs on the side that hold it in the car charger are a little stiff and it can be tough to wiggle the device out when you're done but I'm not brave enough to bend them a tiny but for an easier time to take out the unit. It really isn't enough to bug me but I wanted to make it aware. After using this one I will never buy a different brand again and that's if this one ever breaks!
0061122416|3.0|The book The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, might just hold the key to the secret of happiness. If entered with an open mind and a willing to look deeper, it provides the reader with a huge sense of enlightenment and refreshment, as if opening a door to the deeper side of the universe. It uses many references to all kinds of religion, which gives those religious more hope, insight, and understanding of the world around them. However, the book still leaves even non-religious people with a sense of purpose for their time here on earth. As Socrates once said, \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\"  This book puts you in the middle of the path leading to an \\"examined life.\\" It makes you ponder your purpose, dreams and placement through a story of a shepherd boy who achieves what seems impossible. As he embarks along his journey in search of his dreams, you find yourself inspired to search out the same in your own life and chase it. Though the events in this story may seem out of reach, unrealistic and exaggerated at times, it is all through a metaphor and symbolistic way that leads us back to our own life with a want to be better. Everything in the story seems to be relative back to our own lives, no matter how big or small the connection, and leaves us with lessons to remember such as not to fear, and to do what makes us happy in the long run. Rather than this story being unrealistic, it is merely just an allegory, with everything relative to our own lives. This results in a feeling to do better and make better things of ourselves throughout our lives. If everyone were to sincerely work to make things better in their own lives, the world would become a better place and that's what makes The Alchemist a book worth the read.

0525953728|1.0|This book is a shame. The author is talking about things that no one needs to talk about. The book was not subjected to proper review from the government before release as it should have been.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read! I purchased it on the Kindle so I wasn't sure how looong it would be at the onset, but overall I was very impressed. At times Stephen gets a little verbose so I had to skip ahead to get to the main events! Once I finished though, I found myself thinking about the book very often, it was like the characters had become so real to me (yes I know, a little weird). Again, a great read and very well written... there were many times where I couldn't put the dang thing down!

B005COO1X6|3.0|I have been a Stephan King fan for a very long time, own everything he has written, I think.  This is by far the strangest story I have read.  It was very predictable and ended abruptly. Not sorry I bought it but was left kind of let down.  Not one of King's better works.(Sorry Stephen)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The Movie arrived on time and was in great condition.  The movie itself was pretty good.  The editing was timed to limit the violence.
B006H5120E|5.0|I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to audiophile/videophile equipment and software. The 3D version of Titanic is flawless. The 3D effect is convincing without being overwhelming. It definitely adds to the movie experience. The Blu-ray picture is flawless...believe me. No grain whatsoever and realistically saturated color. I was about to get critical concerning the deep-sea probe and the fact that it was relaying 3D images, but then I noticed that the probe had twin cameras ... nice touch. Buy it. You will not be disappointed.

B002WYJHBA|4.0|I love this movie and was hoping to see a boat load of special features since I was buying the Blu-ray version, but besides the trailer, a music video, and a simple look at behind the scenes, there was nothing exciting special features wise. I was REALLY disappointed since the whole reason you buy DVDs or Blu-rays is for the features since you've already seen the main feature. I'm still happy to have it as part of my collection but I would have been happier to delve more into how the movie was made and maybe even the fictional mythos of pleasantville itself.

B008B0QH5S|5.0|The 11th album by the Pet Shop Boys, it shows that, nearly 27 years after their first album and over 30 years together, they can still create excellent music. I consider all PSB albums \\"masterpieces in their own right\\", and this is no exception. Sure, I had my doubts when the producer was announced, but it seems PSB is so impeccable, nothing can ruin them, so I feel sheepish for doubting them. But I'm very glad I was wrong.<br /><br />The album is a great pleasure to listen to from start to finish, with a few hitches here and there. Some lyrics can sound a bit silly from time to time, but they won't detract from the experience, not unless you absolutely want to nitpick at it. After listening to the album as a whole, I found it interesting, in retrospect, that \\"Invisible\\" was released to give a sample of the sound of the album. Quite honestly, the album is not all slow and plodding, but it's also not completely fast. It has an interesting mixture of musical themes, which actually ends up working well.<br /><br />To start, \\"Leaving\\" is an upbeat sounding pop song with a catchy chorus, but whose lyrical content morphs from a simple tale of love lost to how \\"the dead is still with us\\" and so on. Very interesting lyrical content. 5/5<br />\\"Invisible\\" is the slow, prodding, but somber song, which evokes more sentiment than somnolence. It has this air of loneliness and sorrow that is present in every note of the song, whose lyrical content is up for debate, until Neil Tennant decides to explain to us what it is. Still, we will probably come up with our own meaning, as we always do. 5/5<br />\\"Winner\\" is the upbeat song with a nice message, if not a bit corny, and very different from the usual PSB stuff; but isn't that the great thing, that the Boys can be so varied? Some of the lyrics can be seen as corny, but the song is still oddly catchy anyways. 4/5<br />\\"Your Early Stuff\\" is a slow song, lyrically \\"YWIWM\\" redux, just MUCH worse, but since that was 7 albums ago, maybe it's time to revisit the theme. It's basically a satire of those who have long since written them off, perhaps even since the days of \\"Actually\\", who only care about their \\"early stuff\\", and wonder what they're doing now. It's a fairly short song, but other than that, not bad. 4/5<br />\\"A Face Like That\\" is the ultimate pop song on the album, very PSB sounding. Those seeking pure \\"dance PSB\\" should be very happy with this. 5/5<br />\\"Breathing Space\\" is a slow, gentle song, unlike Invisible. 4/5<br />\\"Ego Music\\" is a fast song, and lyrically something of a \\"HCYE(X)TBTS\\" redux. It's oddly addictive, even with it's somewhat silly \\"me x 4, yes x 4, you x 4, no x4\\" chorus. 4/5<br />\\"Hold On\\" is another inspirational sounding song, but one of these is enough. This song sounds like a showtune song, especially with it's many singers. Fairly dismissible, especially for a PSB song. 2/5<br />\\"Give It A Go\\" is reminiscent of a number of simple PSB songs, a very nice addition. 4/5<br />\\"Memory Of The Future\\" is a bit of a slow, but electropop, song. The melody sounds, at times, disjointed, but listening to it as a whole, it does come together. 5/5<br />\\"Everything Means Something\\" is a harder \\"rock\\" sounding track, whose chorus deviates from the normal 4/4 time signature, while the rest of the song stays in it, becoming (I believe) 6/4, which only means that it goes from \\"1,2,3,4 repeat\\" to \\"1,2,3,4,5,6 repeat\\". A very interesting track overall, very nice addition. 5/5.<br />\\"Requiem In Denim And Leopardskin\\" is a mid tempo, somewhat calypso sounding song, although not exactly. Very simple, at times a bit compex, but overall a nice song with interesting lyrical content, and a VERY interesting title. 4/5.<br /><br />Elysium is a very nice piece of work by PSB, delivering what you would expect; great music, great lyrics. After so long, they've still got it; their \\"recent\\" stuff is still as good, if not better than, their \\"early\\" stuff. But when it's all pretty much one big canon ofmasterpiece after masterpiece, it's all relative from there on out.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this album and most everything it had to offer, just like the albums before it, and I look forward to what the future holds for the Boys after Elysium.

B007SYWFRM|2.0|Don't download this app. Every time I went to a friends village it would always freeze my whole kindle. So I deleted it hoping that when I reinstalled it, it wouldn't freeze anymore. Well when I reinstalled it, it didn't freeze, but it completely reset the whole game. Definately not worth not being on the market. Gameloft, nexttime you put something on the market, make sure it has all the bugs worked out first. Other than that it is a real fun game.

B008MJC6ZS|5.0|With this album, Testament gives its fans more hope of the best is yet to come.  The thrash mixed with melody of the 80's metal is alive and well in Dark Roots. You get everything you wished for in a metal album.  From the fast tempos, to the slow pounding anthems, and even a metal ballad thrown in there, you get the best of what Metallica has done in their rise to glory days.  I rate albums by the music in it, never by history.  Had this album come out in 1986, Testament would have been in their deserved place part of the big 4. Get this album!

B002VHI8FE|5.0|Simply the best new fantasy series out there. Some of my favorite characters in all of fantasy! One of the books where you feel sad when the series is over and you have to leave the characters. Highly recommend!<br /><br />If you like a song of ice and fire (game of thrones) then you will love Joe Abercrombie.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book must be some kind of socio/psych experiment on the public to see how easy it is to lead them by the nose. I haven't read it and never will. Don't be a drone and a follower yourself. I suspect a link to politics.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Not only that but I really do forget how many hits Madonna has made that I used to really, really love! For a minute forget that Gaga and Britney came after. Some say that they are the queens of pop but I totally disagree. Even if you don't like her at all, Madonna came first. She was innovating first. Before there was Rihanna the fashion chameleon, there was Madonna doing the same thing. I think the 3 aforementioned were all inspired by her in some way (I know Gaga and Brit were, but I'm sure Rihanna likes her too). Last year I think, I was at a site and someone said that Gaga was the first artist to have her first four or five songs on the Billboard Hot 100. I was flabbergasted. As much as I've loved some of Gaga's music (I even went through this phase where I had to have her two albums and EP), MARIAH CAREY was the first artist to get her first five singles onto the Hot 100. I think people almost like to forget about other artists just because they stepped onto the scene earlier and like to hype up their favorite singers or whatever. But anyway...<br /><br />Songs like \\"Take A Bow\\" (in my top 5 of her hits!), \\"Cherish\\" (so catchy), \\"Holiday\\" (mega campy but brings back memories), \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" (another upbeat favorite), \\"Music\\" (almost a country-sounding tune but great nonetheless) and so many others make you wanna dance. So many great hits it's damn near escapable! These songs make you feel really good though.<br /><br />Now I'm not a huge fan of these types of collections generally because I'm more of an albums type of person. But I like Madonna's hits more than I'd like to delve into a single album. I actually don't have any of her albums yet but this CD is something I'd actually like to have just so I can enjoy these tracks when I want. Don't miss it kids!<br /><br />5 deserved stars.
0393088774|5.0|Anybody with the ability to understand simple graphs, calculations about percentages, and the difference between millions, billions, and trillions should be able to reap a better understanding of the world economics of the last twenty to thirty years. Krugman writes in a step-by-step manner to keep the reader engaged and following the plot. If you do not learn something with this book, perhaps you were not meant to be one of those that read.<br /><br />When he argues against economists on the right, he often gives two sides to his arguments. One is, perhaps the conservative economists don't understand certain facts which he then elucidates. The other argument is that some on the right are just being deceptive on purpose.<br /><br />Krugman gives prescriptions, both government spending programs and monetary prescriptions that could decrease the unemployment rate by several percent right now. One would be that if Obama wins the election, he should fire the guy who refuses to let the federal government reduce mortgage principals and monthly payments for people that are on the verge of defaulting or are underwater in their mortgages.
B00338QENI|5.0|Science for the unscientific reader, yet based on solid science! An easy to read book that holds your attention, while providing insite into the world of cell line research.  The reader can identify with the real-life characters because the author paints each character in vivid descriptions.  All the fun of a fiction novel with no apparent fiction included.  A must read for every college bound student and their parents...maybe even their grand parents.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am not a die hard Fifty Shades fan, nor am I marching to get it banned from bookstores. Overall, I feel that the trilogy could have easily been consolidated into a single book and that is best seen in the 3rd book.<br />If you've read the first two, I say go for the 3rd one to finish the story. As with the previous 2 books this one is an enjoyable read. Don't expect to be moved by deep, complex prose or a realistic plot. However, it's a very nice vacation read or if you want to be taken away to a nice place where real-life problems don't exist. You start the book knowing you'll get your happy ending and that is indeed the case.<br />That being said, at this point in Ana and Christian's relationship the intimate scenes get a bit repetitive. While the intimate portion of the plot fit well with the nature of their relationship and the plot of the first book and a bit less in the second by the third it almost feels like EL James had a quota of a sex scene every certain number of pages. Additionally, the non-sexual plot gets beyond unrealistic by book 3 so don't expect that either.<br />Take the book for what it is, an enjoyable, easy read that will keep you turning the pages and leave a smile on your face.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had no choice but to read it!  The other two books were so great and I had to know what happened.  I enjoyed this book.  The author has this way of writing that made me feel the way Katniss did, and in this book she's either depressed or fighting and I felt kinda depressed until the last page and than I felt better and was ready to be done with it.  If you were really into the first two like I was than you have to finish it!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This one took us completely by suprise. What a Great Movie!  The acting, the special effects, the stunts, and Arrows.  Like what else do you really need to make a great movie?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started this series cautiously, but soon found I couldn't  put it down. Started 1st book on a Monday night and finished the 3rd book Friday morning over coffee. Yes, it has allot of sex but the story line itself was great. If it reads somewhat immature you have to bare in mind that Ana is only just 21,a virgin who has little dating experience, and very naive. Christian on the other hand is much more experienced for his 27 yrs. and his hard life has added to this. My only \\"real\\" complaint is the authors constant use of \\"oh my\\". That was just too childish and drove me crazy! I see someone has said the sex was just too \\"vanilla\\". REALLY !  Wow, Maybe she should write a sex book based on HER life., or perhaps she didn't understand that \\"vanilla\\" was describing sex \\" without\\" all the extras.  Before Fifty Shades I always thought vanilla was fine but now maybe there's something to other \\"favors\\" !!  Speaking of favors, every time I eat Ben n Jerry's ice cream It will bring a smile to my face. For those of you who are not sure you want to buy the series, borrow the first book but be prepared to get the next two as well! Bet this made allot of husbands and boyfriends happy. Happy reading!<br /><br />S. White

086571701X|1.0|After much research on what resources are available I purchased Sylvia's book on Aquaponics based on the many high reviews it has received on Amazon.  It seemed like a good resource to add to the information I've been compiling regarding aquaponics.  I was immediately dissapointed in that the first  third of the book is spent telling the reader how the world is falling apart and that food production in America is dangerous and driven by greed.  Since I purchased a book about Aquaponic Gardening and not the state of food production in America I quickly grew tired of reading about her opinion on the state of food production.  Is the subject relevant in a book about Aquaponics, sure, but not near to the extent Sylvia chose to spend.  Those who are studying and developing aquaponics are already well aware that things need to change when it comes to feeding ourselves and others.<br /><br />What was also disappointing is that when she got around to explaining aquaponics her approach was narrow and misleading.  In her book she teaches her opinion on what works in aquaponic development and not what is being practiced and producing all over the world.  She completely ignores certain aspects of design and function while confidently stating that her way is the only way.  I may it three fourths of the way thru the book and simply couldn't take it anymore.  She either is purposefully leaving out a great deal of information or simply doesn't understand aquaponics enough to be writing an authoritative book on the subject.

0316017930|5.0|In this book, Malcolm Gladwell asks how highly-successful people become successful. He plays against the belief that these people are unusually talented or hard-working, though of course they are that too. Instead, he focuses on the social background, the legacies, and the luck that brought people success.  Being born in January makes for good hockey players, being born to Jewish Eastern European garment workers in New York in the early 1930s makes for successful mergers-and-acquisitions lawyers, and 17% of the richest people in all of human history were Americans born within nine years of one another in the mid-nineteenth century. He also looks at how some geniuses fail to succeed, for a lack of opportunity, social networks, or class background.<br /><br />Some chapters wander off the main theme but are interesting in their own way, looking at how traditional Korean society causes plane crashes or the Scots Irish tradition leads to family feuds. And a few chapters fell flat for me, like rice paddies and math.  But overall, it's a continually-fascinating book, well-written and fast-paced.<br /><br />All the evidence is anecdotal, so if you think in social-scientific terms you are likely to be frustrated. That's part of my frustration with some of the chapters. However, the anecdotes are sufficiently interesting that I am happy to forgive - the book is better at provoking than persuading.<br /><br />The book also comes with a reminder that many Americans seem to need: yes, hard work is necessary for success, but no person is an island. Society shapes whether you can work hard, whether your hard work can succeed, and sometimes how your hard work goes for naught. Gladwell's bottom line is worth remembering: we can do better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I had seen the movie first so I decided to read the book too. There are some parts that are different from the movie but you can't always stay true to a book 100%. I personally would not recommend this book or the movie to kids though.  A little too violent in my opinion.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|I can't fault Adele's material at all.  Her bluesy and soulful style is addictive and seductive.  Like the \\"Adele 19\\" album, \\"Adele 21\\" is packed to the gills with great music.<br /><br />It's the sound quality that is horrible.  Regardless, if which format you buy this album (or the previous one) on, the same fatiguing sound quality rears its ugly face because the entire album has been butchered by the recording engineers' use of dynamic limiting.  This is the extreme electronic compression of the sound's dynamic range - the compression of the difference between the softest and loudest passages of the music.  What we end up with is a stuffy, congested sound quality that is very loud.  Drums sound like they're being struck by cotton candy rather than drumsticks.  Adele's vocals are also ruined by this because it sounds like she is actually singing with the microphone in her mouth!  I honestly can't listen to more than one song at a time.<br /><br />XL Recordings, the recording label for both Adele's albums, is no stranger to the practice of limiting.  They obviously won't change their ways and they don't have any incentive to since both albums have been certified multi-platinum.  But Adele can do herself and us a favor in the future and sign a contract with a label that cares about good sound.  The Verve or Blue Note labels would do her (and her listeners) good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think its its great! I find myself getting addicted to it..  It is really fun, I thoroughly enjoy it.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|The title of this review really sums up the review nicely.  But I really should elaborate.<br /><br />After noticing that Adele won six Grammy Awards including the Album of The Year Award, I was curious about whether Adele's material was just hype.  No hype.  With Adele's one-of-a-kind bluesy vocal style it was no wonder she could connect with both older listeners and younger listeners (who obviously know she stands out among other current artists).  Nearly every one of the songs on \\"Adele 19\\" is genuinely sung from Adele's soul.  So, I loved the music.<br /><br />Being a vinyl fan, my wife bought the LPs for both Adele 19 and Adele 21 ($40 total).  The LP itself was more massive (thicker) than your average LP.  This is normally a good thing.  But the first sign of trouble was when I eyeballed the surface of the LP.  It had quite a few dips.  I haven't seen this defect for a long time on LPs.  Whoever pressed the original lacquer didn't know what the hell he was doing.  The result was high surface noise - those \\"ticks\\" and \\"pops\\" that a lot of older people are familiar with.  Some listeners may mistake this defect to be the stereotypical sound of vinyl.  But make no mistake: a great pressing is usually so quiet that all you hear is music.  The second negative was the heavy limiting (extreme compression in volume between the softest and loudest passages) applied to the recording itself.  Whether it was done during the original recording, the mixing stage, the mastering or a combination of these stages is not clear.  But the sound is so congested, thick, loud, stuffy, and lacking percussive punch that it is absolutely fatiguing.  On top of this, \\"Chasing Pavements\\" and \\"Melt My Heart To Stone\\" were the worst offenders of sound quality because Adele's vocals were over-recorded to the point of digital clipping; this is distortion in its worst form and it was so severe that I thought the turntable's cartridge was mistracking.  I should have known that it wasn't the cartridge because it plays through anything with ease.<br /><br />So I thought the CD was going to be an improvement.  Another mistake!  The distortion on the vocals for the same two bands were still there and the extreme limiting on the dynamic range (squashed volume difference between the softest and loudest passages of the music) was just as bad.  I honestly can't listen to more than one song at a time on this album.  That's a real shame because Adele deserves better and so do we!<br /><br />I met a recording engineer who once told me that the sound quality of any music can make or break an artists album.  I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now.  Both Adele's albums have been certified multi-platinum.  So it seems that most people dont' care about sound quality.  I might be among the very few who care to listen on an audio component system rather than a little docking station.<br /><br />Sad.  Very sad.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|This movie is so over-the-top cheesy and gawdawful ridiculous that it will go down in movie history as one of the best worst movies ever made; yet, it's still very, very entertaining. Just thinking about it now makes me chuckle at some of the crazy things that they did in this wacky movie. I mean, it's about prehistoric piranha invading an adult-themed waterpark for crying out loud! You can't get much more zanier than that for a movie premise.<br /><br />If you are looking for a heart-pounding scary thriller about killer fish than look elsewhere because this sequel is definitely not for you. The first movie wasn't really all that terrifying either, it had it's moments, but it made up for it all with some pretty intense scenes of piranha carnage. This one is just pure piranha cornage.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames, and Paul Scheer all reprise their roles from the first one, and Gary Busey, and David Hasselhoff join the cast to help add a new level of cheesiness to this outing, especially David Hasselhoff who hams it up royally and had me laughing out loud more than a few times with his antics.<br /><br />The 3D was not the best that I have ever seen, but it wasn't bad. It had some good pop-out effects here and there, but not a whole lot of depth to a lot of it. Some scenes looked better in 3D than others. But I'm still glad that I got this 3-disc set for my collection.<br /><br />The special effects weren't bad either, although nothing in this movie compares to the amazingly gross and gory stuff that Greg Nicotero and his team came up with for the first movie. But this one has some passable effects here and there. And the CGI was very well-done. The piranha looked pretty good, both the CGI and puppet practical effects ones, I thought.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good time with a wild and wet and crazy movie that does not take itself seriously whatsoever than give this movie a try for some good cheap laughs and thrills.

0316113506|5.0|For years I told people that if I was working out for my body, I would have quit a long time ago.  I work out for my head (mental and emotional states).  I am able to think and function better after working out - just a better and easier time of going through life.  This book confirmed and elaborated upon what I had always thought and experienced.  The author makes out exercise to be a panacea, and the fact of the matter is that it truly is.  The studies/literature and the anecdotal evidence support this.  And, from personal experience, I can certainly state with the utmost conviction that it is/has been for me!  Definitely worth a read!

B007L3BMGA|2.0|In common with most purchasers I bought this book out of curiosity and was satisfied that it was not worth the bother! Something must have made me read it to the end, though am not sure what; I suppose it had a certain titillating pornographic worth for an old woman like myself but I've read better in magazines in my youth. That this can be called a romance is a sick joke! To consider spending good money on two more books of the same is unthinkable!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|What a let down! I was singing the praises for this series as I started the third book.  However, this book was boring and hard to follow (because I was bored) and really lacked any emotion that wasn't painful to read.  The ending was nothing but awful. The only high point was when Katniss shot the president.  Darn, this could have been a great series! Now, it will just be mediocre.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Eschatology is that area of theology relating to the manner in which we should conduct ourselves at the end of the world; how we should prepare for Heaven and \\"the golden age foretold\\". It has always been top of the preoccupations that inspire the best work of Bob Dylan.<br /><br />In Desolation Row, one of the most apocalyptic of those creations, so long ago now, he placed a great ship that was full of Jackson Browne's \\"Everyman\\", all bound by their tickets to die. Dylan called it \\"The Titanic\\" and sang, always so weary of the world, \\"The Titanic sails at dawn. Everybody's shouting \\"Which side are you on?\\"\\" where \\"dawn\\" rhymes with \\"on\\".  As John Lennon declared, honest as he was, glad to be acknowledged kneeling at a master's feet: it was not the words of Dylan that mattered but the WAY he said them.  Back then \\"Which side are you on?\\" was a question of real WEIGHT.<br /><br />In the song \\"Tempest\\", another imaginary death ship, sails again in all its awesome glory, complete with every barnacle of accretion since the making of the film Titanic.  It has a new cast of characters. The website \\"expecting rain\\" that is manned by Dylan's most erudite enthusiasts, on 8 September, posted a link to the passenger list of the real Titanic to show, that last of all on the list of those who died beside the icebergs, was one Leo Zimmerman.  The new song growls \\"Leo said to Cleo\\". The comedian is the letter \\"C\\". It could be Cleo Laine or Cleopatra rapt by any one of the many living Leonards on board; but it is also Cupid who is there on both sides, the god of love played in that film by the great Di Caprio himself.  Perhaps, when Dylan found himself as watchman on this White Star liner, he imagined himself as a Leo asking another Leo, the only question he has ever asked any of us: \\"Which side are you on? Are you living or are you dead?\\" The passenger list also shows a \\"Blake\\" and a \\"Wilson\\"; but no \\"Calvin\\" (John?) or \\"Wellington\\" (the Duke?) \\"who strapped on both his pistols\\" or \\"Davy the brothel keeper, who stood up and dismissed his girls\\".  Maybe it is William Blake on board gambling with Presidents Calvin Coolidge from the past, and Woodrow Wilson from World War I just around the corner, that populate the first class cabins of the latest surreal drama.<br /><br />Above this liner \\"He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the east\\" reminds us of his vision of being called to Heaven away from the pains of the earth in \\"I shall be released\\". The lyric surfaced first on the flip side of the \\"single\\" The Weight by The Band; that \\"Crazy Chester\\" Dylanesque song that he never would admit as his own. No recording of Dylan singing that B side was released at the time from the basement tapes of the house called Big Pink. The pre-publicity for Tempest was organised around Dylan refusing to be tied down to admitting that this is his last album of all, in the way that Shakespeare's Prospero in The Tempest drowns his book and gives it all up.<br /><br />The truth is that Dylan gave it all up a long time ago when he retired to the aforesaid Big Pink in Woodstock; perhaps the place where he stood on top of the mountain, blessed beyond endurance by a recognition of his incalculable gifts and not knowing what to do with them; when he felt worse than Christ did when he refused all the kingdoms of the world by refusing to release a thing; while down below, his bizarre gospel, celebrated in songs like \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\" by Julie Driscoll, shook the foundations of the known world. There was nothing for years. A pre-adolescent Kid Jensen, played a couple of songs for Nashville Skyline's \\"world premiere\\" on Radio Luxembourg. We had to be satisfied with \\"Si tu doit partir\\" by Fairport Convention. Along came \\"Self Portrait\\", a parody of his own first double album. There was \\"Dylan\\" and \\"Planet Waves\\".  Apart from George Jackson there was nothing new. The bathos piled high right up until \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". The void was filled by Jimmy Webb for a while and then Bruce Springsteen.  The appearance on the Isle of Wight was perhaps the lowest point, I was there hoping for a new epiphany. \\"Greatest Hits\\" archly included two new songs \\"Watching the river flow\\" and \\"Paint my masterpiece\\".  I began looking for work by Happy Traum.<br /><br />\\"Tempest\\" is proof that perhaps Dylan has been saving the best, in another Big Pink, till last. When Dylan dies who will be there of us left alive on earth to write an elegy such as \\"When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed\\" which Walt Whitman wrote at the death of Abraham Lincoln; a long hypnotic trance about waking; which ends:<br /><br />--for the dead I loved so well;<br />For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for his dear sake;<br />Lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,<br />There in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim.<br /><br />No one has the capacity to disappoint like Dylan.<br />Not since Natural Born Killers' \\"You Belong to Me\\"; not since \\"Series of Dreams\\" or \\"Hezekiah Jones\\" or \\"Blind Willie McTell\\"; not since \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" or \\"Cross the Green Mountain\\"; have I felt that this is awe-inspiring talent; a talent that laughs at itself as Shakespeare does and then struggles with the humour and gambles differently with new cards again.<br /><br />Not since I looked into McCowens record-player shop window in Monson Road, Tunbridge Wells; where I beheld for the first time a grey lovat album sleeve. The typeface was the same for BOB DYLAN and JOHN WESLEY HARDING. For a moment I thought the artist was John Wesley Harding singing songs by Bob Dylan. It was; of course.<br /><br />.

In other words, where are all the national security secrets that everyone is all worked up about?  This book reads like a history book with a little bit of personal injection.  I thought it was very well written, informative, direct, non-political, and non-biased.  People hate it because he is going to make money, although he has pledged to give away the proceeds.  Read it because it is a good book and he deserves your money for what he is providing to you.

The reason behind not giving 5 stars is that I can not pin to other people's boards and the app forcloses its self A LOT. I also had some issues being able to pin from other sites, and was not very informative on how to use all the functions.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I used to workout back in the day, but have been out of it for about 10 years. This book was recommended by a friend of mine, so I decided to check it out. It is a very easy read and covers all the bases. The definition portion is a little tedious, but great for a beginner. I have noticed great changes in my body and believe Mike has the right formula to get you in shape quickly! Give this book a shot, you will not be disappointed.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|If you're contemplating whether to buy Season 4, you are clearly already a fan of the show. For the first 13 episodes of the season, the writing is fantastic. The heat on the Sons increases from all sides, and Kirk Sutter did a great job juggling several intriguing story arcs (I found Juice's to be particularly compelling). That the final episode fell flat was disappointing, but easier to accept when viewed within the context of how great \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" has been for the past four years.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wish I you had a version for my droid.  I use the memory all of the time. Best for calculating.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I like it that eWeather can show me both the more technical aspects of the weather as well as keeping the essentials very clean and aesthetic looking. I also appreciate the ability to customize the current conditions and forecast screens. The maps displays give a good overview of nearby weather. Lastly, I really enjoy spinning the forecast wheel to see the hour by hour weather.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very easy to use. My daughter and I read some of the plans provided. Wonderful for using for church.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I've always enjoyed Christopher Hitchens, whether in the context of written or spoken words.  He has been an eloquent voice of reason in an age when the person yelling loudest is deemed by most to be the winner of any debate.  Mortality is a fitting capstone to a tremendous body of work.  It is at times humorous, but always poignant.  I can't imagine the force of will required to report on one's demise with such honesty.  Although I didn't always agree with him, I appreciate that he stayed true to his values to the end.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The TV show follows this book of the series pretty faithfully, but the book adds character depth and insights into the world and the people that would be too hard to try to include in the show.
0345536886|2.0|I'm a big Grisham fan but this is not one of his better books.  If you read it you will recognize the tired plot -- it's been used before.  I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.
B008D28HYS|4.0|Initially I thought the game was a graphical version of sudoku, but way easier. However as levels started building up it really got difficult. I would rate it very high in terms of past time games. Very addictive once you start.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this book was very entertaining and different. The ending  fell a little flat for me though. Overall a good read.
0525953728|5.0|I received No Easy Day and set it on the counter for a future read, but then picked it up and read the first chapter.  I was hooked, finished it later that night.  I really didn't know what to expect given all the hype and negative comments from everywhere but the book is well written, gripping and tells an important story.  Don't expect it to give away any secrets (there are none) but do expect a great read and to learn details of the event that while told before have never been put in one place, or in order so you could sort them out from the nonsense floating about.  The things we ask these men to do are not pretty but they are important.  I don't know (or care) about all the politics surrounding No Easy Day, but am glad to have read the story and thank the authors for writing it in a way that makes me proud of all the men and women who protect us.  Amazing how many negative reviews popped up before they had time to actually read it. For all you one star reviews out there,  give reading a try - I know it's old fashioned but sometimes it is worth it!
B0065IBZI2|5.0|We should be thankful for artists such as Kate Bush. Musicians who still produce music that comes from the heart. 50 Words For Snow is an excellent album to sit back and visualize all the stories Kate is singing about. I was hoping the songs on this album would be like this. I enjoyed \\"The Coral Room\\" from the album Aerial and the songs on 50 Words For Snow are all on that same format, but each song is unique in it's own way. I recommend 50 Words For Snow for anyone who enjoys creative music that's great to listen to.
0385344333|4.0|On an eastbound Nebraska highway Jack Reacher seeks a ride that will take him to Omaha or Lincoln where he can ride a bus to Virginia.  Two men (Alan King and Don McQueen) and a woman (Karen Delfuenso) pick him up; his goal is Virginia as soon as possible.  In the other direction at a gas station is the corpse of a man who was professionally murdered.<br /><br />County Sheriff Victor Goodman calls the FBI in Omaha who claim jurisdiction and leave with the body while a roadblock is set up to find the two men.  The vehicle with Reacher manages to get around the roadblock and soon enters Iowa.  FBI Agent Julie Sorenson leads the pursuit at the same time Jack realizes that Karen is not part of a trio but unsure why she is with this male duo.<br /><br />Continuing Reacher's journey to Virginia (see 61 Hours and Worth Dying For), A Wanted Man is an exciting twisting thriller as the former military cop learns moms are right about hitching a ride.  Though over the top of Panorama Point, fast-paced throughout this is an exciting Reacher tale as his biggest fear is being trapped in a motel in Kansas.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This was a big DNF. I've tried twice and just couldn't do it, it was too painful.  The writing was all over the place with errors and disjointed/wrongly structured sentences. I never expect a flawless book when reading a self published indie book but I do expect even a little care to go into the writing.  The story was another one of an abusive hero who loves the heroine so much he just can't help himself. Sure he never lifts a hand to her but we all know there is more than one type of abuse, or at least I hope we do, with some of the gushing reviews about the hero I wonder and worry.  On a positive note? The cover is beautiful I guess.
B004GHBQPG|5.0|Johnny Cash's American V: A Hundred Highways is a true American Country treasure.  Great songs and the song Hunt has the soulful tone of years of life and the longing to see old freinds and loved ones in the next life.  GREAT COLLECTION PERFORMED BY A TRUE MASTER!
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Every episode have extras (sweet ;) ). Both image and sound are perfect. Be patience with the initial episodes, although there is a connection between their themes and the following seasons!
B001QFZADA|5.0|Loved this book, it was easy to read, was interesting and insightful! I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It can be very helpful in building on how you few love and approach different relationships
0062059882|3.0|I started this a while ago, and went back and forth on it. Then one weekend we lost power due to storms and so, I spent the majority of the weekend reading, and finished this book. Gaiman's novel was a little dense, slow moving for a while, driven by curiosity more than clearly defined plot (which isn't a bad thing).<br /><br />I have to say I was a little disappointed by this novel, mainly because it didn't live up to my expectations. The only other Gaiman work I'd read was his collaboration with Terry Pratchett in Good Omens, which I absolutely loved. American Gods was a more serious and dense, and so took me a lot longer than Good Omens, which I couldn't put down.<br /><br />That said, I'm always intrigued by updating/adapting/incorporating myth into other areas of life, so the content interested me. Honestly, if I didn't have that interest going in, I might not have finished. The density makes me feel that a second reading would be rewarding, but I'm not sure when I'd be up to the challenge again.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed it, but not as much as I had expected to, and so, was a little disappointed by it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm not going to get in to the pointless debate about whether the book should have been written like some of these people reviewing the book are doing.  He wrote the book, it's done, so let's review the book.<br /><br />No Easy Day was a great read that was I only was able to put down once.  Bissonnette/Owens tells some awesome stories about his life as a SEAL and seems to tell exactly what it was like for him to be in on the Bin Laden raid.  If you've read a lot about the raid over the last year, nothing will truly shock you, but it is still fascinating to hear the story in detail from a man who was there.  I really enjoyed reading the story from start to finish and highly recommend it!
B007SSEBCU|3.0|I love Streep and the makeup was superbly done but, unfortunatly, I could not recommend putting out good money on this one. Since I know Thatcher only from the newpapers I have no idea how much of her background protrayed here was true or fiction. Therefor, the low-key \\"British-ness\\" of this movie was very boring.
B008XG1X18|5.0|always had trouble navigating site through web on kindle fire. the app is fabulous. couldn't. be happier. worth the download.
7883700928|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my daughter, who's learning Mandarin.  Before the purchase, I read about others' feedback.  The low marked ones were not happy that the DVD is not compatible with U.S. players.  I decided to take a risk anyways and it was all worth it!  The purchase arrived within few days,despite the oversea shipping.  To my surprise, the DVD has the option of speaking in English or Mandarin.  It also played on the portable Panasonic DVD player, I purchased at Best Buy.  Most importantly, my daughter loves this movie and hearing it in Mandarin.  If you are very particular about Mandarin pronunciation like me, the movie plays it with a Hong Kongnese accent.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|These novels are good, if you don't mind important characters being maimed or killed off on a regular basis.  I bought this bundle for my Kindle, and would buy each book separately if I could do it over.  Navigation is more cumbersome and I did not save that much.
B0016NF06O|4.0|It seemed to be a strange combination with these two talents but then I remembered that I first became interested in the blues when living in Texas and listening to a lot of western music. There's definitely a relationship between the two. There are times on this cd that Marsalis overpowers the other instruments in the group. He is such a major talent that he's still a delight to listen to.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Movie and cast are great!  Everyone should have a chance to see this movie around Christmas time.  Sweet, funny, poignant.  And in Blue-ray it is awesome!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Who knew Hugh Laurie was such a musical talent! I especially liked the songs he included in this album - Swanee River in honky tonk style. I loved \\"Joshua at the Battle of Jericho\\". That was a favorite of mine that my little folk rock band did waay back in the early 70's. I'll need to order another copy soon because I think I will wear this one out.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|By all that's holy, Dylan's done it again.<br /><br />With Tempest, Bob Dylan continues to mine the vein of creativity that began with 1997s Time Out of Mind.  The man often called the \\"Voice of a Generation\\" is actually, like his friend, the late Johnny Cash, an embodiment of American song.  Folk, early rock `n' roll, 1940s and 50s pop, and jump blues supply the musical foundation.  The opening track, \\"Duquesne Whistle,\\" at first sounds like a field recording from the early twentieth century, something that might have been played at a vaudeville show.  Then the band fully kicks in and Dylan joins the proceedings, sounding a little bit like Louis Armstrong.  It is a jaunty opening for an album with lyrics that are quite often dark, laced with humorous twists and gruesome details.<br /><br />Lyrically, Dylan proves again why he remains one of the most highly regarded songwriters of all time.  He lays out lines in Tempest's ten songs that can leave a listener laughing, shocked, stunned, and wondering, sometimes all in the same song.  Dylan borrows liberally from other sources.  William Blake, The Beatles, and the Bible all get referenced, and there are sly nods to Bob Marley, Paul Simon, Vern Gosdin, and countless others scattered throughout.  The song \\"Long and Wasted Years,\\" with its vintage rock groove and spoken vocals, is reminiscent of the work of poet John Trudell, for whom Dylan has expressed an appreciation.  The songs manage to sound both timeless and new.<br /><br />There are many high points on Tempest, and no lows.  The song \\"Pay in Blood\\" is quite simply astounding, aggressive, and angry.  Bob literally barks out the lyrics; at the beginning of the song, he is almost incomprehensible.  He spews wicked humor (\\"You've got the same eyes that your mother does.  If only you could prove who your father was\\"), road-weary fatalism (\\"But, I'll play this hand whether I like it or not\\"), and cranky brutality (\\"Come here, I'll break your lousy head\\"). At the end ofeach verse, Dylan growls, \\"I pay in blood, but not my own.\\"  It is a towering achievement, even in the formidable Dylan canon.<br /><br />The title track has already garnered much attention.  It is a nearly fourteen minute fictionalized account of the sinking of the Titanic, complete with Leonardo DiCaprio and murderous fights.  It has been declared a masterpiece by some and a tedious dirge by others.  Masterpiece or not, it is a compelling story, and it is a highlight of the album.  Another highlight is \\"Tin Angel,\\" a folk melody coupled with some graphic violence (\\"Bleeding from the mouth, he's as good as dead\\").<br /><br />Dylan's voice has become more frayed than many could imagine, but he uses it well in service to these songs.  He snarls, rasps, and croons; at times, he sounds downright playful.  It is a battered instrument, but it still plays.<br /><br />In an interview from long ago, the late folk singer Phil Ochs commented on laughing when he first heard Highway 61 Revisited because the album was \\"impossibly good.\\"  It is easy to get that same feeling listening to Tempest: in the fifteen years since Time Out of Mind re-established him as one of the most formidable talents on our landscape, Dylan continues to impress, surprise, and remain \\"impossibly good.\\"  Essential listening.

0307742539|5.0|Stieg Larsson's three novels: The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest grabbed me by the throat and wouldn't let go! From the moment I started reading I was under a magic spel. I have read many books, but I have never been so intrigued before. The girl in question, Lizabeth Salander, is surely the most unique character ever created. I won't offer any spoilers here, because you should discover her for yourself. This is classic noir mystery and relentless suspense, if you crave this genre of fiction you will not be disappointed.<br />  Stieg Larrson died shortly after delivering his manuscripts to the publishers. His true-life story is as fascinating as his powerful trilogy. Read the unofficial guide, The Tattooed Girl, The Enigma of Stieg Larsson and the Secrets Behind the Most Compelling Thrillers of Our Time. This book provides much info, plus even more unanswered questions. Truly a great read!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|My macbook pro 15\\" 2008 was overheating and shutting off frequently, it got so bad that I couldn't move it while in use or it would shut off. I took it to Best Buy and they said the logicboard needed to be replaced, a local computer repair store said the same. I read about replacing the thermal paste on the cpu heatsinks and gave it a shot with this. Needless to say (as I am typing on my mac now) it is working like the day I got it! Has not shut off since the swap and is running as cool as can be (~90-120F.)<br /><br />The repair itself was a little intense, just make sure you get the right screwdrivers dont force them or you ay strip the thin metal. Also make sure you wipe the heatsink clean before applying the new paste!! I used a q-tip to wipe and saran wrap over my finger to apply!<br /><br />Hope this helps!

B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great place to get recepies weight loss tips, craft ideas, fashion, quotes, jokes, and so much more. This is not a game.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This game is pretty solid. It's similar to Temple Run in that the point is to go as far as you can, and you earn coins along the way which can be redeemed for gear upgrades, but the graphics are cool and at higher levels the speeds get challenging. Game mechanics are pretty stagnant, though. Worth it for the price (free).
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I'm a rocker for me it's all about the guitar.  I've come to expect blues rock from ZZ Top and this album has blues and rock in spades nicely blended together.  There ain't no pop; get up and dance music on this album it's all about the blues.<br /><br />I Gotsa Get Paid opens with a nice blistering guitar, raspy vocals and strong back beat.<br />Chartreuse lightens up the mood a bit but still rocks with a nice snappy beat, catchy blues riff and nice guitar solo.<br />Consumption flows well from the previous track and again a nice sizzling bluesy solo in the middle.<br />Over You is a nice slow ballad perfect for a rocking slow dance with your sweetie where Billy really shines on vocals with a nice slow searing solo in the middle.<br />Heartache In Blue has a nice slow beat with some great background vocals throughout and a nice catchy riff.<br />I don't Wanna Lose, Lose, You has a nice catchy chorus you can't help but sing along to and some nice subtle guitar work (I'm surprised I haven't heard this one on the radio yet).<br />Flying High's opening riff is classic ZZ Top and once again we get a nice catchy chorus where Billy shines again on vocals, a nice riff and great guitar solo (maybe the best on the album) to boot.<br />It's So Easy Manana slows the pace down again but in a rocking way.<br />Big Shiny Nine's opening sounds a bit like more recent popish ZZ Top stripped down and fits in nicely with the rest of the songs on this album and definitely shines with a short and sweet drum passage in the middle before a nice guitar outtro.<br />Have A Little Mercy wraps up the fun with a nice slow tempo leaving you wanting more which I really do.<br /><br />I gots to admit that everyone sounds great on this album.  I really like the way Billy sounds on vocals.  I'd have to say in short if you like the earlier ZZ Top sound and were waiting for them to go back to their roots this album is for you.  I've already listened to it 3 times today and honestly feel that there isn't a bad song on this album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so addictive! 101 games in one game! Kind of weird but still really fun. LOL! tried to beat sunshine. I failed badly......oh well.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|not bad. nice UI. way to use. try it out. worth it. not bad for being free. good job with the app.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I should be mad at Harlan Coben, because my sleep cycle is totally disturbed since beginning to read his books - and this was no exception.  Fantastic plot turns, great character development.  I always chuckled when someone called a book a \\"real page turner\\"...this one really is.
0307341577|1.0|I can't fathom the thought process that entered the mind of Ms. Flynn driving her to write such a sordid tale. The characters are drawn from the landfill of humanity, none of whom has an ounce of redeeming virtue. \\"Gone Girl\\" is a Girl Scout handbook in comparison to this vile work. Even if it were based on true events, this is a story that need not have been told. It is vulgar in tone and language, highlighting sadistic behavior and extremes in self-indulgence. I finished this novel in order to forewarn readers to avoid this tasteless, irrelevant,and gratuitous story of some of the most unsavory individuals that they will have the misfortune of encountering.
B0078JOAOI|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to watch this, but the wife's grandfather (of all people!! LOL) said it was pretty good. I watched a few episodes, and besides it being a bit on the gruesome side (which i'm sure they were going for) it is pretty addictive. I highly recommend if your looking for a gripping series!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this trilogy a little repetitive at times but, doesn't take away from the fact that its a fantastic series.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game! So much fun to play and it has very useful tools like undo which really helps!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|So far, I really enjoy these books.  I have watched season one on DVD, and the books give a lot more insight an backgound.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|When my friends ask \\"what good books have you read lately?\\", this is at the top of the list.  I always qualify my recommendation, though, with a warning that you have to really pay attention and be open to a challenge.  Some may be turned off by the change in voice, not only character, geographic, and historical era changes, but serious linguistic changes as you progress through the chapters of the book. If you enjoy the experience of following a truly imaginative and talented author through a maze of a story line, and appreciate a unique reading experience, you will love this book.  I am really excited to hear that they will be making a movie of the book, but I can't imagine how they will do this in less than a mini-series format!  Read it.
0805047905|5.0|This book was a favorite of mine as a kid and I purchased it to share with my two-year old, and it has become a favorite of his, too!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a very fun and entertaining game. its a very simple game and easy to play I wish it had more upgrades though
0545101425|4.0|I'm a fan of the trilogy but I thought the first two books were better written then the final. Seems like loose ends were never tied and felt a little rushed. Good end to the series but left me feeling unsatisfied.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent page turner,<br />Gotta love a psychopath!<br /><br />Wonderfully written characters make this a riveting read.  You are waiting for what evil twist will come next ... what will unravel ... what will trip the evil bitch up.<br /><br />The plotline isn't that typical one of conflict/resolution building to a crescendo.  Instead we are teasingly dripfed the revelations through alternating points of view ... but were this has been done before, in Gone Girl the twists and turns are constant and you are kept off kilter not knowing how things will develop.  It runs from intriguing (can't take your eyes of the car wreck of a marriage) to fascinating (like a mongoose fighting a cobra) to horrific (that car wreck just turned into a highway pileup of enormous proportion!).  And the ending is a sucker punch!  Takes your breath away.  Loved it ... so unconventional!<br /><br />The language was witty and erudite, characters are uncomfortably believable and it was a darkly suspenseful novel.
1611760879|4.0|I haven't seen the movie or read the book before, I found it a bit difficult to remember all the characters and at times the narrators voice was hard to understand. I thought there would be more action, dull at times but overall a good read.
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|It was in good condition no scratches also was sealed in like new i recomend. When i played it in my DVD player picture was perfect no defects
0545101417|5.0|I'm a fan of the trilogy and the second book was just as exciting as the first. The book continues where the first book ended and leaves the reader in suspense and wanting more!
630529142X|4.0|It played good no defects when i played it on my DVD player. Got it in a good price i recomend it
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This CD is just flat out amazing.  I was not wild about Together Through Life.  I enjoyed the record but felt it was lacking what made Time Out Of Mind and Love and Theft so fantastic.  In simplest terms...if you like what Dylan has done the last 15 years you will enjoy this record.  I was blown away by the title track especially since I was NOT expecting to like the song.  How this man can still be THIS creative at 71 years old is just amazing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to friends & family.  I enjoyed the fact that I couldn't figure it out & was constantly surprised.
B008BR3QOQ|3.0|This CD is not near as good as Big Moon Ritual.  That album was fantastic and after listening to that for the past few months this release comes as a slight letdown.  Granted the songs are for the most part good but it seems that Chris is trying to jam the songs out just for the sake of it...plus we DID NOT really need another version of an average Black Crowes song.  If you like the Black Crowes after their reunion you will enjoy this CD...but get this one first then follow it up with Big Moon Ritual...that way you will not be disappointed.
B008PE9GSA|3.0|DIE HARD fans of the Lil' Ol' Band from Texas will want to save their pesos and get the COMPLETE La Futura album available exclusively from BestBuy.

B0062P3392|5.0|Jason is super and DiNero is too.  A fun adventure around sever different countries. Action and plot are worth it and story is very well done with emotional content.<br />Darn well worth the money...THANKS
B008XG1X18|4.0|it is easy to navigate on my kindle fire. the only problem is I sometimes have to force close it.
B0061S0A64|4.0|This isn't the app's intended use, but I have my phone plugged into an old set of PC speakers at my desk and I run NodeBeat on \\"Listen\\" mode (where it generates its own beats). It's great background noise, and it's nice to look over at the visuals every so often.<br /><br />There are quite a few settings you can tweak -- such as waveform, key, attack, decay, echo -- that can keep you busy for a while. Still, I must be missing something in the instructions, or maybe I just can't find the full instructions, because I haven't been able to work out how to create my own music other than by some random trial and error. Perhaps you need to be more of a musician to appreciate the do-it-yourself mode.<br /><br />Still, I really love to have this playing on its own in the background.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|The Departed is one of my top 20 movies of all time. With such an all star cast and a splendid director, what's not to love? If you haven't seen it yet, you've been missing out for years.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I bought this book after hearing Gary Taubes interviewed on Doctor Radio (a channel on Sirius sponsored by NYU Medical Center).  Everything he says goes completely against the current \\"common wisdom\\" about what constitutes a healthy diet. That said, he cites a very compelling collection of literature, from well back into the 19th century, that is remarkably consistent in its conclusions, challenging the current orthodoxy of calories in/calories out and fat in the diet is the enemy. This is not exactly a book about weight loss. It is a book about the roots of weight gain and how it can potentially be avoided. Throughout, the focus though is on the health of the major organ systems. It is not a book about getting beautiful on the outside. Instead it is about keeping the inside in fine working order.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown and his \\"brothers\\" are the true heroes. People are to quick to label others \\"heroes\\" but after reading this book and reading what Adam Brown overcame during his life....he is a hero. The men and women of the Armed Forces the world over may not personally agree why they are fighting where they fight but they do it any way. That's just the way it is. I'm live in Australia and recently 5 Diggers were killed in Afghanistan, the darkest day in Australian Armed Forces since Vietnam. All these people who pay the ultimate price are the heroes.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This collection is a must for those followers of the Borne saga. Allot of extra material in the DVD's for those folks who want to go beyond just the movies. The only disappointing fact about the package is that it was recorded and boxed in China.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read this book due to all the publicity and \\"word of mouth\\" recommendations. It did capture my attention and I enjoyed the narrator being from the mind of a college student. I am hoping it focuses more on the story as opposed to the details of sex in the other books...could get repetitious!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|It was slow in the beginning and I scanned a lot but towards the middle it really picked up and I ended up enjoying the book very much.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its cool but its also a little boring too because you have to win the other games. that's why its not five stars
B007SGM084|5.0|A friend told me to read this, that it's not the kind of book everyone is making it out to be... After reading it, I couldnt agree more. Oh don't get me wrong it has many places that give you that\\" I hope mom doesn't catch me\\" feeling. However, sence we're all grown... Some of the things here will make things very spicey at home, while others will have you getting that look that says... How the hell? Couldn't put it down, even when I needed to. Kept saying just one more page. LOL, and made myself late... Yep this is an, it's my day off and I go in late tomarrow kind of book. trust me you'll love it!
B0086449YA|5.0|I've been a fan of Mark Knopfler's music since I first heard Sultans of Swing on the radio and immediately ran out and bought the first Dire Straights album back in 1978 or 1979.<br /><br />I've bought several Mark Knopfler albums through Amazon over the years so Amazon's marketing sent me an e-mail about this one before it was released. I pre-ordered this one before the release date and it just arrived. It's currently on its first run through my CD player.<br /><br />On the first play through I can say with certainty that this album is up to Mark Knopfler's usual high standards. With a few exceptions, it's definitely on the mellow side but Knopfler has a real talent for doing this kind of material and that talent shines through here.<br /><br />Bottom line: another excellent Mark Knopfler album.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This clock has many settings including having to solve an equation to shut it up. It can also get progressively louder until you respond. Good stuff.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I've been listening to Ian Hunter's music since his days fronting Mott The Hoople back in the early 1970s so I guess that makes me a long term fan.<br /><br />I've bought several Ian Hunter CDs through Amazon over the years so Amazon's marketing automatically sent me an email about this album before its release date. I pre-ordered it before it was released. It just arrived and I've given it a first run through the CD player.<br /><br />After one play through I can say this is another excellent Ian Hunter album. If you liked his last two albums, Shrunken Heads and Man Overboard, and his 1970s albums like You're Never Alone With A Schizophrenic and the self-titled Ian Hunter, you'll like this one.<br /><br />Ian is in his 70s now and he's still putting out great music. I only hope my creative energies last well into my 70s, as Ian Hunter's clearly have.<br /><br />Bottom line: another excellent Ian Hunter album. Highly recommended.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was not a bad read, it is quick and although not plausable I can see where the author delighted in using the control of present governments vs the people.  Rich vs Poor, high rank against lower rank.  This book keeps your interest and does have all the elements of a teen read, somewhat like twilight.  If thinking too much of Children being killed for sport then this book is not for you.  The fact that it is someones' imagination does help and although it is not grusome, Hunger Games does have fragments that one could feel the grief of loved ones. There is some very sweet romantic bits as well...anyway, it was a good read not too long, and parts of it touches the heart and it really does make you want to read book two. Remember, it is a tale of imagination and fiction..enjoy.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Tolkien had it right. No matter how grand the tale, it can (and should) be told in three books. Any more, and it's just fluff, meant to part the book buying public and their money. This book and the previous book are proof of that. Absolute rubbish. Don't waste your time. Nothing much happens. The action could have been summarized in 50 pages.<br /><br />At least have the decency to pull steel while you're robbing us George.
0525953728|5.0|After the killing of Osama Bin Laden, the media brought much misinformation about the event. Now the preposterous claim is being lofted by the President's people that Barack Obama was personally responsible for the success of the mission. It's like the man who flicks on a wall switch claiming to have created the light that follows. The author of \\"No Easy Day\\" has now set the record straight. He was there, and he knows whereof he speaks. Navy SEALS, working with support from multiple sources, are responsible for UBL's demise. One is tempted to use the President's own now infamous words against him: \\"You didn't do that. Somebody else did it.\\"
B007A4SDCG|5.0|A great book!<br />Steven Pressfield talks TO the reader not AT them.  Without being condescending, he puts forth theories that force the reader (me anyways) to take a good hard look at where they are headed.<br />I had just made a career change when I heard about this book.  His straight-forward (no BS) style definately appealed to me and has inspired (big word - but it's true) me.<br />I find that i'm using his suggestions and that they are working for me. I'm \\"doing the work\\" as he puts it, and seeing results.<br />Definately a recommended read for anybody working in the arts or considering going into business for themselves.<br />5 stars and two thumbs up!
B00514HDNW|2.0|I Am Legend by Richard Matheson is a book about a lone human survivor in a world populated with disease stricken vampires. I'm sure many people did not hear about this story until they've watched the movie starring Will Smith. Not surprisingly, I am one of those people. However, I Am Legend was a novel published back in 1954! Of course the story got popularized and a couple of movies was actually created based on the novel. With that being said, I didn't really like the movie version and I don't even remember if I finished it or not. I decided to give the book a try since there has been so much talk about it in the past. At a little over 300 pages, it wasn't that big of a risk. Upon completion though, I still find myself not really liking the story all that much. In fact, I was pretty close to not wanting to finish the book just like with the movie.<br /><br />The story is simple. Robert Neville believes that he is the last human in a world infested with vampires. Somehow he is immune to the plague that managed to transform all other humans into vampire-like creatures and make his world a living hell. As the story progresses, Robert decides to try and solve the mystery of what makes these creatures tick and why it is that they are afraid of garlic and the holy cross.Throughout the story, Robert will have self doubts as if you think about it and put yourself in his position, why should he even care? He is the last surviving human and its not like he will make a difference even if he finds out the truth about the whole affair.<br /><br />One of the biggest disappointment I had with I Am Legend is that Robert is just so boring! Robert spends most of his days fortifying his home against the vampires and once night comes, he locks himself in his home and drinks himself to a stupor to try and forget about his situation. This pretty much continues until about the first 40% of the book. Now, I do understand that this is a depressing story and as such, the character should also follow along those guidelines. It just wasn't that fun to read. For the last 60% or so of the book, things do get a bit more interesting once Robert actually does his best to find out the reasoning for the plague and how it affects humans. While reading, I was so anxious for them to explain the \\"legend\\" part. Towards the end, once I realized what it actually meant, it did give me some chills.<br /><br />Upon completion of the book, I just can't help it but to think of how this story could be rewritten for the modern day era. Robert practically has the whole Los Angeles to himself and it felt not much was accomplished. It would have been awesome to read about Roberts adventures when he goes foraging for food and supplies throughout the city. I also wished more emphasis was being put on the vampires. At certain times, they seem more like mindless zombies to me than vampires. To give credit where its due though, the author did successfully create a very depressing atmosphere and I think that was his intention. Its not so much about the action or killing but more so about human weakness. My final conclusion is that I Am Legend is very average and does not really deserve the hype it did.lso follow along those guidelines. It just wasn't that fun to read.

B0000ADY9I|5.0|The best live rock 'n roll/blues album ever recorded. Amazing recording quality for the time. The band was at the height of their powers and could blow away their contemporaries.
0307387151|4.0|Atonement starts out as a beautifully penned, thought-provoking novel and ends the same way. This author has the ability to both tell a compelling story and transport the reader beyond the page.<br /><br />  I love that the book starts out with a determined young girl whom we get the opportunity to watch grow and change throughout the course of the story. Ian McEwan wrote through the generations flawlessly.<br />  There were points in this book when I felt the gravity of the writing pulling my heart down as I both identified and felt emotion for the characters. My only real criticism of the novel was that I felt some of the scenes were a bit too full of description, causing the actual events unfolding to lag a little bit. If some of the passages had been a little less lengthy, I felt it would have served the story better.<br /><br />  I wish I could have the option of leaving this book a four and a half star review. It was not quite five, but better than four.
B005K17RU0|4.0|yes this app is slower than some but the extras make up for it. love the 15 day forecast and the wind speed indicator.

B007SGM084|4.0|Good reading for a weekend. Light, amusing and er... very learning.I´d recomend its reading with a sexual partner. It will certainly put a lot of spice in the relationship ...
B008EL4YX6|3.0|Fun to do if you're waiting on something. Has a lot of background ad networks for a paid game though. Hence 3 stars instead of four.
0525953728|5.0|If you can put aside everything good or bad you have read about this book, you are in for a real treat. It's fast paced and well written. I too read it in under 2 days, because it was hard to put down.  The fact that these men do what they do gives me the chills. The fact that OBL knew we were coming for him gives me some satisfaction.  In the end, he was just a coward. Read this book -  people will be talking about it for years and you'll want to be in on the action.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I just finished this novel and all I can say is that it is INSANE!  In the best way possible...I haven't read a novel that kept me so interested and excited to read more in quite some time.  In fact, I even told me husband all about it because I just couldn't fathom the person who wrote this.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The fifty shades trilogy was amazing. Its a must read book. I bought the first book, read it in a day, same thing goes for the second and third. I gave it to two of my friends to read and they loved it as well. There are time in the book that can be annoying like when Ana always forgives Christian and the constant sex scenes. There were just a little too many of them. But overall I loved it or else i wouldn't have reread it like three times
B007HGPBRC|2.0|I speculate it was written to help his wife and family financially. Left me totally underwhelmed and cold, with no interest to read anything else by the same author. I can only describe the text as banal, repetitive and flat.

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|While the story is a bit far fetched the effects were tolerable. But it was a bit of reach to see all the odds against these two people only to become heroes.

0345803485|5.0|Seriously one of the best books I've ever read. I read it in 2 days because I just couldn't stop reading it. It is a pretty intense book, so if you are more of the \\"conservative\\" kind of person. I am warning you. But I loved it.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|so I needed to print something out and I no longer own a laptop so I decided to download a printer app. This app works great. i just did a test page and it only 2 minutes ago and it wad fast quick and easy. I am so happy I found thid app. The only thing I didnt like was the font it printed with. I dont know if it is the way I downloaded my doc files or did it change when I wanted to print. its okay I could adjust.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I stumbled across this book at Target and was drawn to it by its unique cover. When I read the back I was intrigued so I bought it. It took several chapters to get use to the flow of the different perspectives, but they flowed together so beautifully that it soon ceased to be confusing. What I loved most about this book was that the style was new and different. The descriptions of the different circus tents were fantastic but accessible to the imagination and the characters were vivid and individual.<br />\\"Night Circus\\" is brilliant and new and a wonderful read. I highly recommend it and I can't wait to see more from Erin Morgenstern.

1250010489|5.0|Being in the Information Security field I took great pleasure in reading the first book of this pair (Zero Day) and found myself engaged with the story and the characters almost instantly, if I am honest I have grown tired of the shift towards Jihad as the new 'dark side', but that theme did little to dampen my enjoyment and I raced through as quickly as my eyes could carry me.<br /><br />It was a long wait and one which I was expecting to be longer given that I was expecting Trojan Horse to be released later in the year, so when it arrived on my Kindle I was extremely keen to get going and dived into the book after a Whispernet download and charge. The story was different to before and maintained my interest, thankfully this book was once again based within the realms of reality, which makes me slip into the fictitious world far more easily than when for instance watching two keystrokes create 40 lines of code in a film.<br /><br />I found this book even more compelling than the first and I watched the percentage complete increase rapidly as I chased to keep up with the story. I don't pretend to be a literary genius or word-smith, nor did the book offer twists beyond those I had envisaged but towards the last quarter I couldn't possibly put it down. Furthermore I was so connected with the characters I was willing to forgo meals to ensure that I wasn't kept guessing about their relative fate's.<br /><br />Would absolutely buy a third should it ever arrive and for those with an interest in this field or computing in general, I believe this to be an enjoyable 'duology'.<br /><br />Hell if Dan Brown's Digital Fortress can become a best seller, this should absolutely be able to because it is far far better than that.

B0007M8HTW|5.0|This album fulfills all of the expectations I had about Miles' forays into rock music, and as far as I'm concerned, leaves Bitches Brew in the dust. The music is so compelling on this record that it's almost hard to listen to--it refuses to sit in the background, slaps you in the jaw, forces you to pay attention through each of the 20+ minute tracks, and makes you like it. An amazing jazz-rock record.<br /><br />Side-Note for guitarists: this record has made me more excited about playing electric guitar than anything else in about... oh... five years or so. McLaughlin's tone is ball-bustingly beautiful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app really is very helpful.  I check it often when I am using my Kindle Fire.  I don't want to drain the battery completely.  I would recommend this app for everyone.
B008B11R1Q|2.0|This is a huge disappointment. Even if they were to put out a very similar album out, at least make it interesting. Within a minute of each song boredom sets in. The music lacks anything interesting and the vocal melodies are painful. Painful to listen to the out of key singing and the trite lyrics. I guess this proves how important Baria Qureshi was to the band. She is missed.
1401235166|3.0|I was watching for other references to evolution and/or to the Tennessee \\"Monkey Trial\\" besides the title, and maybe I was just imagining them as a recurring subtext, but still....<br /><br />* Mrs. Jack Spratt, having worked herself thin (and resumed her maiden name, which turns out to be Leigh Duglas), continues her quest for self-transformation, training herself to meet the challenge of defending her claim to rule the abandoned Fabletown.<br />* The children of Snow White and the Big Bad Wolf (I just love saying that) go through training and testing (and having their vocabulary expanded), and one of them shows signs of being the sought-for heir to the title of North Wind.<br />* The Yoop gets tired of being a man-eating monster, and hopes to become a respected citizen and maybe eat just the occasional person on the side.<br />* The goblin-like servants at North Wind's castle transform themselves into liveried footmen at the request of visiting dignitaries.<br />* Three avatars of Hope appear, and there is a candidate to become a fourth, but the original fourteen are remembered, and an undetermined number of dead holders of the various titles are seen.<br />* And then there is the actual trial of an actual monkey, in the conquered land of Oz.<br /><br />All of this personal evolution raises an interesting question: since being North Wind (or Goldilocks, or one of the Three Little Pigs) seems to be as much a job title as a personal identity, will a new Mr. and Mrs. Jack Spratt appear, and how will Leigh Duglas feel about it if they do?  I wonder whether this question will be answered in coming stories.  Which leads me to this note:<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers who say this book does not stand on its own, but if you skip back a volume or two, or even to the beginning, you may enjoy the ride quite a bit.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to this website. thank goodness for a app to get easier. soon you also will be addicted.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|Been to MANY concerts of different music genres, but none come close to Prince when it comes the mix of talent and performance. I had the pleasure of seeing him in the Superdome during Purple Rain<br /> tour. The man had a generator up his butt. Electric. For me, Purple Rain was his best work. I can let it play over and over and never tire of it.
1451627297|5.0|I've read every Stephen King novel (except the Gunslinger novels which, after reading the first one held no interest to me) and I long ago noticed a pattern in his releases. Since his 70's masterpieces, he releases one great book every 5 years:<br />81 - Cujo<br />86 - It<br />91 - Needful Things<br />96 - Desperation<br />2001 - Dreamcatcher<br />2006 - Cell<br />2011 - 11/22/63<br /><br />Amazing how that has transpired. My own opinion of course. Sure, he's had some good books in between (Pet Sematary, Misery,  The Green Mile, Different Seasons, plus a couple of the earlier short story collections) but a fair bit of crap also. Yet somehow he remains my favourite author.  The one great book every five outweigh the 4-5 lesser ones in-between.<br /><br />This is the first SK novel I've reviewed in here and am doing so because I felt I owed it to what was a truly great book. I loved this. I read it at work in 20-30 minute shifts when I could get away with it (no I'm not a slacker and yes, that sort of this IS frowned upon here) it was so good. I'm not from the USA and JFK and his death (and legacy) holds no great meaning to me other than it's some tragedy that happened in `the past'. I was not overly interested in the subject matter of this book and wasn't looking forward to reading it. Reading it wasn't a high priority to me, it was something that I would `just do' at some point given it was a King novel and I read all King novels. After the thousand pages of rubbish that was Under The Dome and the underwhelming fare that SK has released of late, 730 pages of JFK was not an appealing prospect. I remember actually uttering a sigh of disappointment after seeing how long this one was when I picked it up.<br /><br />How wrong was I. I admit it. I judged a book by its cover - or in that instant (and a bit of recent past history to compare it to), its length.<br /><br />11.22.63 is thoroughly enjoyable and a reminder, for me at least, just how brilliant SK is.<br /><br />Amajor issue with many previous SK books (mainly the 80's ones) has been the endings. So much time is spent building up characters and scenarios only to have a ridiculous climax. The stories were so big that they were never going to be able to be concluded with any great satisfaction. Yes I'm a fan and have been since I was old enough to read his work. I'm not a one-eyed fan that loves everything he does and can't take others criticising him. His work has been so varied that no King fan could claim to love everything he's written. Anyway, there's no stupid ending here. It's as it should be (though perhaps as expected) but satisfying all the same.<br /><br />Time travel can be hit and miss. You pretty much always just have to go with it and its true here. However, the protagonist is aware of his actions (even small ones) at the start but the further he goes the less he seems to think about the consequences. In reality (if you have such a thing with time travel) even the smallest action can have massive consequences. Even sneezing near someone could have a dire effect - if you think about it. If you can't get past that side of things then you won't enjoy this (or any other time travel story) and probably won't be reading this anyway....<br /><br />I recall at the start of the novel thinking (or guessing) how I would like things to transpire in the set up and to my satisfaction, they did. I loved the `reset' scenario. I'm not sure if that's been done before by a previous writer but it's an interesting and important part of the book.<br /><br />The pacing for the first third is spot on. A chunk could be taken out of the middle section when things begin to slow down (about the time Oswald starts to become the focus), though I enjoyed the time spent in Jodie. The last third is fast paced as time starts to `catch up' with our protagonist.<br /><br />As for characters, they're a good bunch. Most are interesting but, of course, have the usual King `twang' and the at times somewhat annoying speech patterns. You also get the usual tangents of someone's backstory that don't always necessarily drive the story forward. Most here are worthwhile though but, as is often the case with SK, could be trimmed back a bit.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, 11.22.63 is King's latest 5 year semi work of genius. Not one he'll be remembered for and probably won't make many Top Ten King Best Of's but it's on mine and to me, that's what matters. I hope you get the enjoyment out of it that I did and are reminded of the brilliance SK is capable of.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I was recommended this series by a friend. I bought them one at a time, but ended up buying all of them in a week! I couldn't put them down.

B002OSXDAU|1.0|I read this book because Paul Ryan (Rep. VP candidate )gives this book to all his staff members. The book is garbage filled with the most detestable people in American literature. While the theme of \\"free markets\\" and laizzze faire economics\\" is the credo that all behaviour in a persons own interest is acceptable and should be free from societal interference, the characters are so flawed it is hard to be sympathetic, even if one beleives in the premise.  The book is a \\"pudding\\", a \\"tome\\" that no one should be subjected to even if required reading because of academic requirements. I have also purchased \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" which I do not intend to read unless forced to or am paid to do it. Since neither is likely the book will simply be part of my Kindle archive.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was so excited to see that there was finally a pintrest app for the fire. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because always has trouble starting up.
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|I began watching How I Met Your Mother on Netflix late last year and quickly became hooked on it.  The cast is exceptional, and the scripts are generally right on the mark with few exceptions.  Unfortunately, Netflix didn't have Season 7 and I didn't want to start watching in the middle.  I had hoped to get Season 7 on DVD before Season 8 started but it won't be released until October.  I'm not sure what the reasoning behind that is so I bought it digitally and the HD quality from Amazon is very good over my Roku.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot of misses in Season 8 from some of the other reviews, but as it turned out there was really only two episodes that didn't work for me and were disappointments.  I thought The Slutty Pumpkin episode had so much more potential especially after a big buildup to it in previous seasons.  Also I don't find Chris Elliott as Lily's Dad particularly funny and although I loved the flaming beekeeper episode, 46 minutes was also a miss where much of the episode was devoted to Lily and Marshall trying to get rid of Elliott.  For me, he's always been annoying and the only thing I've ever tolerated him in was Groundhog Day.  I was glad to see him depart after a couple of episodes.<br /><br />That being said, I thought all of the other episodes jelled together nicely with a lot of ups and downs, some sadness, and a lot of laughter. And it's that mix that really makes me enjoy this show.  Well, that and finding out How Ted Met His Kid's Mother.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Very unusual and thorough analysis of companies' success story, nicely organized material, well-defined and surprising corollaries.<br />Great amount of thrilling facts about real life companies and personas
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have heard so much hype about this trilogy, so I jumped on the wagon and read them.  With each book it was harder for me to stay interested and took me longer to read them.  Women have shared such enthusiasm and excitement about these books, and yet I found them poorly written, far fetched, and quite frankly just not worth the hype.  (Does Christian Grey sound like a 2 pump chump to anyone else out there?)  This must be a make believe world to escape to for extremely lonely women with very mundane lives who are starving for attention.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Purchased for my 7 year old and he has a blast playing it. The picture looks mean but its not too bad or violent as some video games are.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Haven't finished this one yet but so far this big book is great.  I love the way he writes.  Never the way you expect it to go.
B008602KQI|5.0|I missed going to see this movie in the theater, so I was anxious to see it when it came out on DVD.  I had a pleasant surprise before the DVD arrived, when after I purchased the DVD, I received an instant video from Amazon.  I watched it from my computer 2 days before the DVD arrived (and twice since receiving the DVD).  The movie was excellent and I would recommend this movie.  I am looking forward to the next movie.
B0012NVGHU|3.0|The second CD (american tour) did not play & the movey track skips, the movey DVD was OK.These were new (not used) CDs
B005HSG3U6|5.0|When they say, 'Made for Kindle', they mean it! It fits perfectly and snugly. You can remove the Kindle from the case and put it back as many times as you wish fairly easily.. Very impressed with colour and matte finish of the product.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|IMHO, this is a must have weather app... Well designed, appropriately kept updated. Do yourself a favor and try it... I'll bet you will simply love it!
0525953728|5.0|It was a well written book that kept me interested the entire time. Me and my friends/co-workers would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about what we do.<br /><br />Let's be honest, from experience I can tell you that there was no classified material disclosed in this book. The DOD and the DOJ would have stopped this book from ever being published. And believe me, they can and will.<br /><br />This was a few people in the government getting butt hurt because they couldn't get their power-boner on.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I do love this show - a bit silly perhaps in places but delightfully so.  This is a great fairy tale and, I think, a great show for its genre.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This was a good read but it definitely could have been better. First, Anastasia is supposed to be strong and not exactly submissive but throughout the entire triology she allows herself to be controlled by Christian. It really seemed more like willing domestic violence than a kinky relationship. I would get into the book for a few pages then turn the page and get angry again. I read the entire triology and all of the books are the same. Good for a while then angering then good for a while then angering. As long as you know what you are getting into its an okay read but it's not high quality.
0307951529|5.0|Loved the book. Really inspiring. Make sure to also read the art of nonconformity as well.  Both are excellent. I also like Chris's blog.
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry, but this book is horrible.  I tried to give it some time to get good as others told me to do, but it only got worse as I kept reading.  I read about 30% of the book on the Kindle until I couldn't read anymore.  The writing was so poor, the sex scenes weren't even good enough to make the writing palatable, and the main character in the book made me want to hurl.  Not sure what people see in this book, but it definitely wasn't for me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is an amazing product. 20 years ago I could not imagine I would be reading books on my phone. Very easy to use!
B0083Z614S|5.0|For those of you who love the classics like \\"Jane Eyre\\", with a happy ending, this book is for you. Reminds me of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", Grimm's fairy tales, Narnia, and Wuthering Heights all rolled into one. I'd heard of this book for years, and ordered it on my Kindle just for something different. Reading it was delightful, the author has such a way with descriptive passages to pull the reader into the scenes. The plot is pure magic as the characters Mary and Colin learn about themselves and others with the help of the Secret Garden and the friends they make there. Thanks to the Kindle, I can get a whole world of literature I haven't read since my own childhood.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|games ok but you need cash and that Sufis. you can do fried option but only if you had friends
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This game is soooo awesome and totally addictive. And the ability to cross platforms and challenge all my of my friends, regardless of what device they use is great. I Love Uni-War!!!
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book. I heard all the fuss but not until i bought it did i understand why. the book if mostly for woman and the seller was great too although i wish it got to me sooner took about 15-21 days to get here.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I thought I liked it on the Internet but the app is even better! I would recommend this app to anyone who love looking at clothes or just crafty stuff, the humorous category has great pictures and hilarious sayings!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved, loved, loved it!!! Sadly, a prophetic depiction of where we could be heading but amazing writing. I as so drawn in That I finished in a weekend! Yes, there is romance but it is not the heart of the story by any means. Highly recommend it!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It shows the battery life of my kindle fire more accurately than the battery indicator of the device. I recommend it to everyone that owns a kindle fire.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Mostly it dragged like a drama, then it would get ridiculously funny at times. Overall, it was cute and the two actors were superb. It was a cross between an old Jennifer Aniston flick and a Drew Barrymore comedy. Hope that helps.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn hill struck a diamond mine when she released this!! It to me combats a lot of stuff that is going on in the industry now.
0688172377|5.0|Every female on the planet should read this book. We have to stop female mutilation and in order to do that, we must be informed. But this book is so much more than just that story. Waris is a Miracle, a Survivor and a Role MODEL in every sense of the word!
B009329ZF2|3.0|I was expecting utter crap and this movie surprised me a good deal. A very decent Sci-Fi Action romp.<br /><br />Yes its a CGI fest with thin characters and some issues with ridiculousness. This was expected.<br />Yes the acting is thin (but not annoyingly bad as I expected)<br />The CGI is top-quality.<br /><br />Like most PG-13 movies this one could have been improved with an R rating to up the sex (Decker is smoking hot but under PG wraps), violence (its a war move duh!) and language (they are sailors, hello?)<br /><br />This movie makes me yearn for a true Battleship war movie though with some real need for that old-school broad-side tactical sea warfare.<br /><br />If you liked Cowboys and Aliens or any of the lesser comic movies (Thor, IronMan2, Captain America) you'll like this movie.
B002ZG97LK|4.0|I don't know about you but i am tired of Hollywood re-making already good movies, but i would have to admit that this re-make is one i really liked. I will always like the original, but i think they did a really good job with this one. For me i think the kids today will identify with the music and the dancing more, where as if you watch the original they probably will laugh. I thought it was great that they even had some of the original songs from the 1984 version. I would say that i really enjoyed watching and tapping my feet to the beat to this fun movie.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|Last year September I went to their concert in Japan. The Mothership Returns brings me back of impression and excitement just like it. After few songs played Chick asked the audience. Smiling. What do you call this music? Jazz? Rock? Or, fusion? Do you call them space music?  The mothership returns with familiar songs to deliver fun to us. Their stage was a showcase of perfect virtuosity and explosive power. From every tune they play, we understand they have moved on, keeping polishing, taking what they learned along their way and inserting something new here and there. They even add some delicateness and a portion of sophistication which was not available yet to the younger RTF. Re-enlivened songs inspire and stimulate each crew members. Band's flair for the dramatic, and for fun, is amply displayed here. Their music refuses to ever sound dated.<br /><br />The real selling point of this set is the DVD. The video goes in and out between black-and-white and color as the band members talk on camera, which vibrant their performance with life remarkably. They dig into the origins of songs, exchange anecdotes and generally express the same affection for one another that is notable in the accompanying performance scene. It is fun to know a typo became a final version of the title \\"The Shadow of Lo.\\" Lenny named the song after Io, one of seven moons of Jupiter, but the record company misprinted it as Lo.<br /><br />Frank Gambale says why they can work well together is only due to non-existence of egos in their performance. It's all about the music. On Miles on Miles, Miles talks when you get egos involved with playing free, you can't do it. He also says it's the reason why Stan Gets couldn't take good part out from Miroslav Vitous.<br /><br />The Mothership Returns spreads out new texture in front of us and even with more heat that fired up the original band members.
B007CKNX28|4.0|I am not a fan of modern pop music, but I am also some dinosaur trapped in the past that believes that the only good music is 3 chord rock.<br /><br />I actually like this album because it evoked an emotional response - something that hasn't happened in a long time. If you remember the first time you heard \\"Tean Spirit\\" by Nirvana or \\"Harder to breathe\\" by Maroon 5, you will definitely find a moment like that on this CD.<br /><br />I can't tell you where you'll find it... you just have to listen to it yourself.<br /><br />&lt;On Soap Box><br />In our iPod world, where we listen to the same songs over and over again... or listen to the radio where everything is so middle of the road so you won't change the channel, it's nice to listen to an album from beginning to end... in the order that the artist intended.<br /><br />The vocal doubling, the interplay of musical instruments, the rhythmical interplay... it's a journey.<br /><br />Don't just listen to your favorite song... start from track 1... close your eyes... and enjoy the experience!<br />&lt;/off Soap Box><br /><br />Missing Pieces - the subtle horns (which you never hear in rock today), the keys, the textures and layers of this song are layed back while the urgancy of Jack Whites voice make for an interesting tension. The song lets you breath in places, then takes you back into the frenzy.<br /><br />Sixteen Saltines - this is probably the hookiest song on the CD. The riff is simple and infectious. A very salty yet groovy track.<br /><br />Freedom at 21 - Odd meter percussion that echo, a riff that reminds you of 7 Nation Army takes you on a sonic journey that plays with the stereo effect. Instead of just laying in the normal stereo field your left and right ear are treated to their own different solos, and in some place, lyrics. This song is best listened to with headphones!<br /><br />Love Interruption - An excellent visual picture over folk guitar. This is the first time that you can settle down and breath.There are times when the music cuts out so you can concentrate on the anguish in the lyrics.<br /><br />Blunderbuss - this song starts off with keys instead of guitars. The keys and vocals are joined after the first verse by sparse drums, and violins. Continuing with the mellow trend that was started with Love Interruption, you're pulled into the angst of the writer again.<br /><br />Hypocritical Kiss - this song starts off with a honky tonk piano and Jack explaining \\"My temper got the best of me...\\" - things to listen for are the tension in the music... the constant strumming of the guitar and the disjointed keys that differ in both the left and right ear.<br /><br />Weep Themselves to Sleep - At this point, the album begins to ramp up again... the urgency is returning a little. To me, this is kind of the sleeper song on the album but the glue in the transition to the end of the project.<br /><br />I'm Shakin' - a great throw back to a bluesy kind of song that will get you moving again, clapping your hands and bobbing your head.<br /><br />Trash Tongue Talker - another groovy blues song that features a layed back guitar used sparingly and rhythmically with some tastey throw back riffs thrown in for the true music afficianado.<br /><br />Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy - this song is kind of a bridge between blues and bluegrass that show the musical roots of Jack's past.<br /><br />I Guess I Should Go To Sleep - upright bass, complex chords, tripled vocals (baritone, soprano, tenor) singing in unison... great song.<br /><br />On and On and On -  After showing us rock, blues, bluegrass, this song starts off with a mellow smooth jazz groove that lulls you into something that reminded me of Tori Amos. At the end, the song seems like it could ramp up into some chaotic frenzy, but holds back.<br /><br />Rake Me with You When You Go - is my favorite track on the CD and a great way to end this journey. This song is almost 3 songs in 1. A nice hook is established in the beginningof the song. Next a fiddle bringing in some sonic variety as it playes with a Rhodes piano. Finally, the Jack White guitar and hurried vocals come in which are doubled and layered with a frenetic urgency that makes you wonder if the notes sung by each person were improvised or felt in the moment. This song left me asking for 1 more!<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD and that you enjoy the journey.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|The Magic is an interesting book similar to her book The Secret, underscoring the importance of giving authentic gratitude for all that you have in order to bring more into your life. In the same way the Secret encourages positive outlooks, the Magic encourages the philosophy- to be grateful.  It is a simple philosophy for making a positive change within your life.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|This film is truly a wonder. How does it manage to charm us so after many years? To start with, a wonderful cast with Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn starring, Jacqueline Bisset and Eleanor Bron and others in supporting roles, but Hepburn and Finney run away with the honors. Stanley Donen of \\"Singing in the Rain\\" among his many credits directed and  achieved stunning realism. Then there's music by Henry Mancini. What's more, a very touching and funny story: a very realistic portrayal of an adorable couple, from when they first met while travelling in Europe, both fancy free bohemians in spirit, to the present when they are driving a Mercedes coupe and are clearly successful. However, even the bumps along the way, the arguments, the hurts, the making-ups, even the  extra-marital affairs, all ring true as a very realistic story of a couple as they pass through the various phases of their life together. Flirting, passion, arguments, fights, hurts, joy, a child, and most of all humor are all here on display.There are laughs galore throughout which help lead the story along, and don't come across as add-ons for the sake of a joke or to throw some humor at the audience watching. To Donen's great credit , the story unfolds not in a linear straight-ahead fashion, but rather back and forth in flashbacks and forwards, sometimes even overlapping. Never a drag, never a dull moment. This film will sadden you when it's over because you'll want more, you won't want it to end! This is a film that is engrossing, funny, touching and wonderful even after repeat viewings; knowing the plotline and story doesn't decrease the viewer's enjoyment. The actors are all top notch and the story is joyfully realistic and  easy-to-believe,  wonderfully told with the direction and editing of Donen, a great master of mid-century American cinema! If you don't know or even don't like (is there really anyone in that category?) Audrey Hepburn, this film will open your eyes and change your mind; if youare already a Hepburn fan, this film rates 10 stars, not merely 5! It's a joy to watch from beginning to end. It is up there with Funny Face, Roman Holiday,Charade, Nuns Story, and Breakfast at Tiffanys.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Grandson comes over and takes my phone or Kindle fire and play for a long while.  Its a very addicting game!  It takes some thinking as the levels get harder and harder!
B008602KQI|3.0|Well I thought the movie was above average. I think my problem with the movie was that I had heard how good it was over and over that I was expecting more than I got out of the movie. Don't get me wrong it's worth watching but I can not in my opinion rate it with 5 stars and not even 4 stars. Maybe 3.5 stars maybe
0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist written by Paul Coelho is a memorable and worthwhile novel to read. This book is relatable to a wide audience as it addresses life's daily struggles, chasing your dreams, and the quality of life attained when following their hearts. This novel leaves a lasting effect on its audience and allows them to take an analytical perspective of how they are living.<br />  This is the story of a boy's journey to fulfill his dreams. Santiago relies on many spiritual elements to guide him through the obstacles he faces on his voyage. Coelho compares Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity and furthermore finds the similarities between them. Santiago displays this combination of religions as he prays to God for strength, relies on omens, and talks to nature for guidance.  This religious variation expands this books audience as more people can relate to it.<br />  In addition, this book is filled with inspiring life lessons that touch the audience on an emotional level. We learn these lessons alongside Santiago as we watch him mature from a curious boy to a knowledgeable young man. He matures as he learns the difficult art of alchemy which includes understanding the signs of nature and the Soul of the World which connects every object on Earth together. He demonstrates his growth as he transforms himself into wind and channels the Soul of God within himself.<br />  The fictitious nature of the novel is apparent in the strange occurrences that happen throughout the book.  For example, when Santiago rashly makes decisions without plans, transforms himself into wind, and learns how to communicate with nature. Although these additions make the story interesting, it is important that the audience focus on the realistic points of this book to get the largest lasting effect.<br />  Overall, I highly recommend this novel for everyone who wants an attention grabbing, unforgettable experience that they will remain with them for the rest of their life.

0099579936|1.0|I left a one star review on the UK site some while ago, saying this book is boring, repetitive, no plot, not erotic etc. I now realise I can leave a review here, so after giving it some extra thought, here goes. First, I came to the conclusion that there's two books out there with the same title. The good one where the five star reviewers are squeeing over Mr Grey, wanting him in their lives, and raving that this beautifully written book is the best they've ever read. Then there's the one I read, the same one as the one star reviewers. I then read an article saying how this book is thinly veiled paedophilia, and all the tumblers fell into place. How Ana reads as a naive 12 year old, and Christian comes across as a stalking 50 something year old (geddit?)psycho. Ana talks, thinks, wears clothes and her hair like a kid, even her Inner Goddess says things like 'I clap my hands like a child that's just been given candy' after her first BJ. I mean.....yuk! This is a common occurrence in this book, a childish thought right alongside the sex. A NDA folks? What's that? 'Don't tell Mommy, it's our little secret'. No wonder this book left a really nasty taste in my mouth. Yes, as the blurb says, this book will stay with me for a long time. Much like a bit of dog sh*t you can't get off the sole of your shoe.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am so glad that pinterest has updated and works so much better now! It still does foreclose at times, but it seems to be related to the links rather than the app itself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great product should be able to edit profile though but very well setup and laid out. Makes it easy to navigate.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I hear about this app everywhere. Everyone has it on their smartphone or tablet and I see people playing it all the time. This is a terrible app. I played 3 levels before I just couldn't stand it anymore. I hate apps like this Doodle Jump and so many others that take 10 minutes to come up with, but for some unknown reason sell millions of copies. How little sense can a game make? Birds that suicide bomb pigs who stole there eggs? It's a video game, but it could atleast be somewhat realistic. I just can't see the obsession...
B008XG1X18|4.0|please fix the force close ans freeze problem! ! I can stay on this app on my K.Fire all day!!!
B00931JMRE|5.0|This album has everything ZZ Top is famous for! Great down and dirty blues sound with most of the tracks being upbeat/faster numbers with a ballad thrown in. Very reminiscent of their earlier music with elements of Rhythmeen added as well. I listened to this album front to back and there is not a single track I would consider skipping over. A must have for any ZZ Top fan!
0345803485|5.0|I love it !I'm not a big fan of a romance and this book... show you different kind of love story ;) And I know it would never happend in a real life but let us dream ;)
B008GX2YQQ|5.0|I dare to say that Animal Collective is one (if not the most) original bands out there right now. The record is full of creative sounds that structure like a piece of art. It resalts noise in beautiful ways \\"today's supernatural\\" is an example. Consistency in instrumentation is also a virtue in the piece. This is the voice of the future.
B00881VLCE|5.0|lots of puzzles to choose from. difficulty levels vary. this is a very addicting game! I cant seem to get enough!

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I've played this game for several hours now, and have had no problems with it. I find the game rather challenging and fun. Addictive game play.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Let me get this part out of the way: A lot of the changes from the book were unnecessary. Some of them I get -- like making him less violent and more the reluctant hero, making them wear clothes, and dropping the telepathy. But the trip down the river added nothing to the story, slowing down what could have been a great race against time by a hero whose best efforts are foiled again and again.<br /><br />That said, this movie was a lot of fun. My daughters loved it. My wife loved it. I've seen it three times and have've gotten bored yet.<br /><br />The marketing of those movie was a train wreck. It should have been a blockbuster. But you can still enjoy it. Buy this video!
B008602KQI|1.0|The movie is good I saw it in theater but I had to return the DVD because it kept freezing and skipping scenes! I was very upset. It started freezing right when she was entering the arena. Very frustrating. I sent it back and asked for a replacement and did not get one. I had to call and see what the hold up was because 2 weeks had passed. They said they could not send me a replacement but they could refund my money and I could order it again. No thanks I'll pick myself up at target tonight so I can actually finish watching it.
144234430X|5.0|A wonderful novel by one of the greatest writers ever. His look into the troubles of time travel is brilliant. I also can see that a lot of research went into this novel.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|I began this book hoping for an in depth analysis of whether tragedy/evil/the breakdown of a child into a killer is nature or nurture. Sadly, such analysis was lacking in this work.  After only 100 pages of the mothers self-indulgent, narcissistic monologue, I'm convinced, in this story at least, it  is 100% nurture. What do you expect to come of a child whose mother, by her own admission, never wanted? Of a child the mother felt nothing for the first time she held him? Of a mother who complains bitterly during pre-pregnancy, throughout her pregnancy, and after the child is born that parenthood is a curse that cuts into her precious time drinking brandy until 4 am or her lavish trips all over the world?  Eva's character is implausible. A mother who violently threw her child and broke his arm because he was difficult to potty train. A  wife who extends a lavish (solo) vacation while her husband waits to pick her up from an airport she decided not to return to. A mother who tells her infant son \\"I hate you, you little s---t.\\"  There are sociopaths with better realization of others than she, and at least in this narrative, I found it hard to believe than any factor other than being subjected to the world's least nurturing, most narcissistic mother lead to the breakdown. Columbine, Littleton may have been nature and nurture and may have been the product of bullying. Not so in this novel. The reviews are right: this is a story about a monster, but the monster in this case never faced a single day in prison. The story fell short in this regard. I was expecting balance and analysis and found Mommy Dearest brought to a sickening low.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|Byrne beat again. Byrne and St. Vincent made a great album with great sounds and incredible arregment. Is, in same way , the come back of the best Talking Heads spirit. All the songs are mixed by Petrik Dillett, in a very difficult combinations of instruments. Is powerful and easy to hear, a great CD. Two yeas of production and a incredible brass section. All the songs are signed for Byrne and ST. Vicent. Is nice to hear something new with old elements. Try to hear it, sure you will liked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  Hard to put down.  Very entertaining. I would recommend this book not just to teens but adults as well.  Easy book to read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this daily.  I love being able to record what the Lord says to me.  The tech service is great.  I had a small issue a while back and they quickly released an update that fixed it.  Then the tech personnally emailed me to let me know it was fixed. great team!
B005OJTVAW|5.0|This little cover is great!  I love the pink color, and for the price you can not beat it!  I highly recommend it!
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, very hard to put down.  The story was actually a little vague. There seem to be more detailed sexual descriptions than story. I still enjoyed the reading. This book was more of an introduction to the next book.
B005KE7CES|3.0|Album has some cool moments, but its overall unmemorable. I wanted it to be a lot more than it was.
0345803493|5.0|As the first book leads us to the second book, there is a good story developing. I liked the way everything progressed about Christian and his past and why he was the way he was. Very creative.
B00122N23M|5.0|I really liked this download. There's nothing new, but the cuts all sound fresh. Great selection - except Donegan's Gone - which I could have passed on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an amazing book.  What a great plot, it just  has so many twists and turns I don't know how the author could possibly think of all of them. Stayed up all night to finish it.  Can't wait to read another of her books.
0345803485|5.0|Caveat: This book has to be one of THE most entertaining, jaw dropping, intense reads I have EVER read. And I know books.<br /><br />Review: Everyone is saying how \\"CHILDISH\\" the book is and how particular words repeat but did you ever consider--THAT'S HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE READ? I swear people can be so naive in what they say that is hurts my soul. E L James didn't force you to read the book. She could have, and did, become a best seller WITHOUT your opinion. This book is very well put together. For such a young character, Ana learns so much about herself in such a short amount of time. One thing I would love to commend Ms. James on is the way she portrays the character in such a light that we haven't seen in other books. While others are burying their heads in useless junk about vampires and wolves, this trilogy gives everyone the opportunity to read something worthwhile.<br /><br />Good day.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good Movie but missing some elements of the book.  Also about 2 minutes of the movie are blurry.  Good acting.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|game is great. ive had no bugs. not one. the game has never deleted any of my coins or items or lost my progress. as for the comment about it being impossible to top 1800...that's stupid. my high score is 4376. :-D
0385344333|5.0|&lt;---if you are the bad guy, that is.<br />Lee Child at his best, taking the plot hither and yon and back again. What a fun read!<br /><br />For those who haven't roamed in the world of Jack Reacher; picture a 6'-plus, 200lb- plus, homeless, decorated veteran, with the moral code of a Buddha and a mind as calculating as Hawking's. Unleashed against what he considers a threat...be that against himself, someone under his charge or the entire United States of America; he becomes the worst nightmare a villain could imagine.<br /><br />The mind of Lee Child is an odd place to wander. Where most writers see the logical next path of the plot, he sees multiple paths and takes the reader on every one of them. I picked the bad guy out in every chapter...and I was wrong every single time.<br /><br />A simple cross country trek to find the woman behind 'the voice' was all Jack Reacher had in mind. Relying on the kindness of strangers and his thumb he started across the heartland on his way to Virginia. Some strangers turn out to be friends, others try numerous times to kill him. ergo: Not friends, but enemies of the vilest kind. He finds himself wanted by not only a nasty terrorist cell but by most of the alphabet agencies of our own government. He out-thinks, out-shoots and outlasts them all...after all, he's Jack Reacher and the series must continue.<br />But how he does it and what his thinking process is during this whole adventure is what makes all of Lee Child's books in this series both fun and intellectually stimulating to read.<br />5 Stars, a bit much? Not hardly. This is a fictional thriller of the highest calibere. Of course, some of the scenarios are outlandish...so is the hero. He's Superman, Batman and Ironman without the costumes. He's Rambo without the jungle. He's Jack Reacher...homless, aimless and totally dangerous!<br />Read this book, allow yourself the fantasy and enjoy the ride!!!
1416550550|5.0|A four-year-old girl from an aristocratic family is abandoned and placed on a ship to Australia in the early 1900s with nothing but a small white suitcase and a book of fairy tales. The mystery of why she was abandoned and shipped to Australia, haunts Ivory Walker when her adoptive father discloses this long-held secret to her on her 18th birthday. Her granddaughter, Cassandra, ultimately takes on the mystery after Ivory dies, and discovers that the author of the book of fairy tales her grandmother had with her on the ship is crucial to solving it. A compelling, fast-paced story that keeps you guessing until the very end. Morton is a masterful storyteller.
B0012Q732O|5.0|Love the movie.  My cup of tea with a little intrigue.  There is excitement, action, romance and a successful conclusion that will heart warm all ages into knowing we can do anything with love in our life.

0525953728|2.0|No Easy Day contains very little new information. The preparation that went into the assault was interesting but rather what you would expect for an operation of this magnitude.<br /><br />The first half of the book is about Owen's life as a Navy Seal. It was informational, but not riveting. His story is somewhat of an egocentric tale of a man who is very impressed with himself. It seems that his favorite thing in life is hunting down and killing humans. That is his job and he is in a war, so killing is part of the job.<br /><br />Owen, like many enlisted soldiers, thinks that he is smarter than those further up the chain of command. His complaints about the Obama administration are:<br /><br />A. They are no longer allowed to kill unarmed men.<br /><br />B. If they surround a house, they must give the occupants an opportunity to surrender instead of just blowing the doors and killing everyone inside.<br /><br />C. They must photograph the dead to prove that they did not kill women and children.<br /><br />The book is written on what is probably a sixth grade level so it will be a fast, easy read for almost anyone. If you are looking for a lot of unpublished information on the raid, you may be disappointed. The book is more of a diary than a story. Other than Owen's disdain for Obama, the book is not political, nor is it a look into the ravages of a war that never seems to end. It is just a collection of facts with very little character or emotional development. I see no reason to hate the book or to love it.

B00007GZR5|5.0|This is a moving video where Williams is trying to deal with his wife's suicide after losing their 2 children and trying to save his wife's soul. Williams is impressive in this serious role. The visual effects are remarkable and will amaze you. This film deals with suicide, depression, heaven and hell in an almost dream/nightmare feeling. A touching, surreal movie.
0307474259|3.0|Here are the helpful points IMO:<br /><br />1.  The book uses reasoning to open your mind to re-examine weight loss.<br /><br />2.  He questions the prevalent semi-starvation mentality to weight loss  (ie., reduce calorie intake and increase calories burned).<br /><br />3.  He focuses on more of the concept that if the body wants to be fat it will get it's way.<br /><br />4.  He examines the role of raised insulin in the storage of \\"bad\\" (triglycerides) fats in fat cells.  But this is where is starts to get questionable...<br /><br />Here are some of the negative points IMO:<br /><br />1.  He focuses so much on insulin but doesn't give much scientific proof proving that it's only about insulin.  All of his suggestions are based off of this narrow view that it's about your food and its effect on insulin and then insulin's effect on your fat cells.  There are lots of other things going on when you eat food and lots of other hormones and enzymes.  Do a YouTube search of Gary Taube on CNN and Dr. Oz makes this point, as does Jillian Michaels.  In other words, it's not just about the insulin.<br /><br />2.  The author puts rice and potatoes together with sugar, processed flours, etc... and without much evidence.  He doesn't prove that potatoes are bad or actually have a disastrous effect on insulin like sugar or processed flours might.<br /><br />3.  The author doesn't take into consideration the work of Dr. McDougall who proposes a largely starch-based diet (ie., rice, potatoes, corn, beans etc) supplemented with vegetables and fruits.  Dr. McDougall has thousands of people who have lost lots of weight and kept it off with his diet.  It shares similarities with Gary Taube's suggestions in that it restricts sugars and processed flours.  But McDougall promotes whole, natural starches (rice, potatoes, corn, etc).  My take is that whole, natural starches might boost insulin some but in the range where it's healthy and thus doesn't promote the fat-storing activities that a unnatural spike in insulin would produce with artificially concentrated foods (ie., sugar, refined flours, etc).  For those interested, read McDougall's book and check out the reviews:  [[ASIN:1609613937 The Starch Solution: Eat the Foods You Love, Regain Your Health, and Lose the Weight for Good!]].<br /><br />4.  Gary Taube even says it's ok to have artificial sweeteners in moderation.  I know this is off topic a bit, but he really should look at the evidence out there of the disastrous health effects of artificial sweeteners.  This really makes me doubt his medical expertise.<br /><br />Overall, his book suggests a diet heavy in fat, followed by protein, followed by vegetables, follow by some fruit.  It could work for some.  But I don't think he lays out a strong enough case to reject McDougall's starch solution approach.  Or if you do some research, google \\"The Rice Diet Solution\\".  There are other starch-focused diet solutions that many find helpful.  If Taube's claims were true, then those doing mostly starch-based diets (ie., McDougall's) wouldn't be able to lose weight and keep it off.<br /><br />Taube needs to re-examine and re-research the way he groups carbs together and scapegoats even the good whole, natural starches (ie., rice, potatoes, corn, beans, etc).
630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams plays the role of a robot, that after an accident, becomes self aware. You are along for the ride as he tries to become more human and his attempt to fulfill his need to love and to be loved. With an almost eternal life, he sees his loved ones pass away one after another before him. Williams plays the role well with heart and a touch of humor.

I have never had it mess up. its so easy to use. forsure and by far my favorite app! thanks y'all for making it. my husband on the other hand hares it lol. if I'm not on pinterest I'm trying to recreate something I seen on there.
0920668372|5.0|I just finished reading this book. The majority of the reviews are right: this book is going to tug at your heartstrings. As the mother of a 20 month old boy, I have yet to experience all these phases in his life...and this book is about how much he will change but my love for him will never waver, and I hope he passes on that love to his child(ren).<br /><br />As for those dense negative reviews about any perceived creepiness, I think, as with almost all children's books, you have to maintain a suspension of disbelief and not take things literally. The continuation of the *theme* of how the mother expresses her love from when he was an infant is what makes the story so poignant.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|kept my interest not as bad as some time management games. wish there was easier way to get energy it runs down quick

B000FC0SIM|4.0|It's been three months since I finished last book on Kindle. It doesn't feel good not to read books. So I re-started to read Stephen King's memoir On Writing.<br /><br />I bought this book because of some recommendations from friends on twitter. At first I thought this is a biography rather than a writing textbook. When I finished, I finally figured out this is a hybrid of both.<br /><br />Stephen King is a fiction writer. But I'm not a fiction book lover. If you by chance checked my reading history, you will find almost all books I read are non-fictions. But that doesn't matter. Thanks to the movie industry, I did read some of his novellas. And I did have one favorite Stephen King story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />In the first part of this book, Stephen King shared with us the memoir. You will definitely know more about him. One point I have to mention here is Stephen had problems too. He was an alcoholic and drug addict. You can find out how he dealt with them.<br />The second part will be helpful if you want to write. In this part we can find out many practical techniques on writing. There are no big rules but very handy stuffs.<br /><br />What I think the most interesting metaphor is theory of fossil of relics. In Stephen's theory, writing stories is like to dig fossils in the ground. You got to be extremely careful when you find one.<br /><br />And again I'm told to read more. No reading, no writing. This is what I've learnt from the book. (And the reason why I invested dollars to a Kindle reader!) I have difficulties in reading English, because it's my second language. But I'm lucky enough to read original books though my reading speed is unbelievably slow.<br /><br />The last part is Stephen's near-death experience in 1999. I never knew that! (Since I'm not a real Stephen fan.) And this part answered the big question why this book is there.<br /><br />The book is about 300 pages. The language is easy to understand even for a foreigner. A lot of advice are there to be noted down. I really enjoy reading it. This is a book for every potential writers. I'm looking for a good time to re-read this book.A lot of advice are there to be noted down. I really enjoy reading it. This is a book for every potential writers.

B007O4XX9K|3.0|Before anyone writes this off as the ramblings of another hyper-anal audiophile, let me state first and foremost that I love this album and feel it's Joe's best album/work since BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS. And while I'm anything but an audiophile, even I've noticed how loud recent releases are, but this one blows them all away (both literally and figuratively).<br /><br />I bought this album on the same day as the Beach Boys THAT'S WHY GOD MADE THE RADIO and Neil Young's AMERICANA. I listened to all three albums back-to-back, and when ANALOG MAN came on, the sound was so overpowering that I had to turn the volume down to HALF of what I had it set for the other two. Now, if the Beach Boys & Neil Young can get it right, why can't Joe? This is such a fantastic album, and I hate that listening to it is something of a chore instead of the pleasure it should be.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Overall the movie was pretty good.  But I thought it left a lot out of what was in the book, and I thought some of the actors were not the right ones for the part.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game it quite fun but once I get to the 1000's in distance, this thing starts to lag so bad it doesn't let me do any commands so I just fall and die. some people are complaining that they cant turn. to those people I say turn up your sensitivity.  Have Fun!

B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is the first Jojo Moyes book I have read.  Reading is important to me, and I always have at least one or two books on the go, so I didn't expect this book to be particularly special - But it is.  If you only read one book this year, THIS is the one !  It pulled me into it, and moved me to the extent that I read the whole book over two days - and when I rang and recommended it to my sister, she ended up sitting up all night reading it straight through.  It is completely un-put-downable, and the characters and ideas stay in your mind.  I certainly can't think of a book I have enjoyed so much, for years.
B002TOJHCM|5.0|This is pretty good for iPad using Kindle free app if you're jamming and want the real chords to the songs. No capability to change keys and the references to \\"chorus\\" or \\"verse 3\\" are annoying but surmountable.

The techniques and examples are easy to follow and encourage the reader on his/her journey to happiness and peace of mind.  Brilliant!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept me from doing anything else the whole time I was reading it! When I wasn't reading, I found myself thinking about my characters & wondering what was going to happen next. I could barely put it down from the moment I started, and I had no idea where this book would take me! It was unexpected, heartwrenching, and made me fall in love with some characters while wanting to strangle others! I became more involced in this story than I have in any other other book I've read. I would highly recommend this book!!!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Love this series!! I am so excited that it's in Blue Ray! It's of excellent quality, seller remitted to me very quickly. I am pleased that it's region free and description from seller was very very thorough. I have watched the series repeatedly and find that it is especially awesome on my great large screen Smart TV! Exceptional Quality! I cannot wait until Season  3 in January!!! I also bought Series 1 and 2 for this miniseries. High praises to seller, creator and movie itself.
0767817664|4.0|Bought a used DVD. Product came in great condition. Worked like new! A little scartches was on the DVD. But nothing that you could not just clean.  The movie didnt mess up anytime during the movie. Overall 4/5 for the condition not perfect but worth the price set!
B003UESJH4|5.0|My only regret is that I did not get the Blu Ray version! However, the seller did send a wonderfully flawless product in a very timely manner :) It was fascinating the methods the \\"therapist\\" went through and it was made very real in what the \\"therapist experienced personally in order to assist the King. The acting by \\"the Queen\\" was superb to show that level of loyalty, and the viewer \\"feel that intensity was amazing. I loved that he was the second son and although was as mortified as Firth's Character throughout, I really enjoyed the movie...so I watched it again~I'm sure I am pleased of my purchase I am very pleased and would gladly recommend this movie as well as the seller. Worth the watch!! and the rewatch!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I enoyed this book alot.  The characters were well developed and even though you didnt like some of them you still kinda wanted them to win.
B002VECLVO|5.0|It was a movie of good quality discs sent in a very good receiving time from my seller. I did not truly understand the ending...was the young guy deceitful? It moved as fast as I expected and Julianna Moore was excellent in her cast as I presumed. It was fairly melancholy but served to show Colin Firth's versatility as an actor. I typically enjoy his work. I wasn't enthralled with the storyline but that's a personal view. It is apparently highly acclaimed and I totally see why, but I was left pretty unsatisfied at the end and that will always be the feeling I will remember.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I and my children enjoy playing this. it's challenging, but there are hints to help one out of a sticky wicket.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|It was a very round about story. It was very confusing and I think myself fairly well educated and very good at solving mysteries. I saw most of the reviews and I was very curious.

Would definitely buy from this seller again due to efficiency and quality.

B003F3NEBG|5.0|GReat buy!!! Excellent seller! Outstanding quality product! I love the story. I watch it repeatedly and often!! I love Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was perfect in her depiction of Elizabeth Bennett in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice...Colin Firth is the ONLY choice of Fitzwilliam Darcy! Prefectly cast and time honored classic. Im sure that I will never regret this buy. The quality is topp of the line and I really appreciate the seller so willing to get this product to me very very quickly!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie is amazing I think it was really good I got it the minute it came out and everybody wanted one I don't understand how people don't like this movie but I respect that they don't like it it think the movie improved your view of the book cant wait for catching fire!  I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES BIGGEST FAN! !!!!!! I think it was the best movie I have ever seen Omg this movie and book are amazing !!!!!!!!!!!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I bought it out of season. I received it very quickly. I have yet to know if it is a good quality disc as I have not yet previewed it. I lan to do that in December during the holidays. I am excited to own this movie as I love Colin Firth and appreciate Jim Carrey. Great seller, product receipt pretty quickly.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Wonderful although very technical.  I have been off wheat since I started to read it a week ago.  Although the weight has not begun to fall off me yet...the way the book claims.  I do feel  better and did not find it tooo difficult to give it up.<br />It is nice to know that there is one less food item that is trying to poison me.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This behind the scenes look was at least as entertaining as I had hoped.  The performance parts were spot on (Could we expect anything less from these guys?) and the narrative felt informative and intimate.

0061122416|3.0|The Alchemist is a stimulating book for those who choose to open their mind to many abstract views of the world around them. Although jumbled and difficult to fully understand, the Alchemist asks the reader to analyze the workings of the world. A book that makes you think is a book worth reading. In the book, Paulo Coelho puts forth many of his religious beliefs and gives the reader an opportunity to embrace them and evaluate the amount of truth behind them. Some of these beliefs include aspects of fate, dreams, and most often, God, making the reader's acceptance of such things key to their understanding of them.  One such lesson is chasing one's dreams, or rather Personal Legends as the book puts it. Coelho simplifies the idea of chasing dreams, telling the reader that when they do so, the whole universe conspires to help them. This makes the message hard for the reader to relate to, as we all know \\"chasing your dreams\\" is never an easy process, in contrast with the book. The amount of value the novel puts on pursuing dreams is truly inspiring though, encouraging the reader that dreams will lead to fulfillment. Through probing the text, and trying to understand the author, one may find the morals of this book powerful truths that are applicable to their own lives, the reason I value it as a worthy book.<br />Throughout the novel, Coelho piles life lessons high upon each other and bombards the reader with them, making it difficult to focus on the main message. It is exemplified when Melchizedek speaks to Santiago in the plaza, touching on Personal Legends, the Soul of the World, the world's greatest lie, and other aspects of the world without going into depth, making the reader wonder what aspects they should focus on and try to understand. His seemingly scatterbrained writing makes the most important messages that much harder to pick out and comprehend. Yet if one is patient enough to sort through the jumble of writing that Coehlo presents, and keeps an unbiased, untainted mind, the viewpoint explained is one worth knowing.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|Bob Dylan is on cruise control. At the age of 71, he still tours relentlessly. And he records new albums about as quickly as your great-grandfather can peruse his collection of pre-prohibition vinyl records. He's like an old, rickety car making its way down the highway on fumes, puttering on with no sign of what'll give first: the engine, or that old tape-deck.<br /><br />Dylan said that Tempest would be a wild ride, but I never really believed it. And despite some stellar early reviews, I don't think Tempest is a return to form the same way that Time Out of Mind. But it is a continuation in that same general direction, picking off where subsequent lesser-albums like Love and Theft and Modern Times left off.<br /><br />The album opener, \\"Duquesne Whistle\\", is a typical 21st Cenutry Dylan opener: a strong, catchy song with just enough lyrical curiosity to latch onto,  \\"Don't you hear that duquesne whistle blowing/ Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart/ You're the only thing alive that keeps me going/ you're like a time-bomb to my heart\\" Those apocalyptic images make up one of Tempest's many motifs. The third track, \\"Narrow Way\\", features a burning White House, an empty cup, fighting in the streets and seeing someone both \\"buried\\" and dug-up. \\"You won't get out of here unscarred\\" Dylan says, before eventually waxing romantic.  Later in \\"Pay in Blood\\" Dylan tells us, in a particularly ghoulish bark, \\"I came to bury/ and not to praise\\". Toward the end of the record, there's a long ballad about the Titanic sinking (it's the title track). Like another one of Dylan's long and uneventful ballads, \\"Joey\\" from 1976's Desire, \\"Tempest\\" is tiresome and of questionable sentiment-- and makes reference to \\"Leo and his sketchbook\\". Dylan croons about the masses drowning amid the Titanic's extravagance, but it's hard to tell whether he actually cares. That ballad, clocking in at just over 13 minutes, is neither as good nor as coherent as the one which precedes it: a nine minute song called \\"Tin Angel\\" which deals with themes of personal struggle, salvation, and reformation and is the closest  Dylan ever gets to classics like \\"Hollis Brown\\".<br /><br />The most difficult song to devour is \\"Roll On John\\", which is either a tribute or mockery of John Lennon's legacy.  Dylan, from the present, warns John in the past, and smugly characterizes him as the singer who always played \\"to the cheap seats\\" and dressed in rags \\"like any other slave\\"; and then Dylan wails \\"I heard the news today, oh boy\\" and other Beatles lyrics, and makes wild exaggerations like \\"there was no more Joy\\" after Lennon died; and furthermore advises John to pass-over into that land where \\"the Buffalo roam\\". On one hand, Dylan does seem genuinely miss the influence of one of his greatest peers. On the other hand, I can't help but hear a few jabs to a rival between the lines of commemoration, especially given the extravagant way the lyrics pile-on praise and bizarre, sometimes outright goofy, imagery. Or perhaps the topic strikes too close to home for Dylan to handle. Whatever the case, \\"Roll On John\\" is the strangest, and in my opinion worst, song of the album.<br /><br />Ultimately, Dylan is Dylan, and he puts out whatever music he wants to. There are those among us who would sacrifice all the musical world in exchange for the privilege to listen to Bob Dylan's music, and those of us who wouldn't. After hearing Tempest, I still belong to the first group.<br /><br />Like Shakespeare's play of the same name, Tempest isn't Dylan's best or most enduring work and it might just be his last. But if that's how things wind up, it's not cause Dylan has planned it that way. \\"I ain't dead yet/ my bell still rings/ I keep my fingers crossed\\" says Dylan in another track, \\"Early Roman Kings\\".

B007VUA7VO|4.0|maybe I'm dumb,  but I never really figured out what all the data meant. like why was a.c. charge different then usb charge. probably just dense,  but I use this more than my other battery app. so I guess I like it well enough.
B001RTP48G|5.0|In my opinion this is the best Pet Shop Boys ever!  Every song is memorable. Fans will listen to this again and again.
B002UWH8SS|1.0|What can I say. for all of us that loved the original sg1 and Atlantis, this new Star Gate is not a even a shadow of what the Stargate series was. First off, the fat dude that wins the contest for a video game puzzle solving, has only one type of acting, which is the  \\"Irony face\\" attitude.  I could not stand more than 10 minutes of watching this. and when I  saw the sex scene I just turned it off. There is absolutely no seasoned  or at least natural actor or actress on this series. there are only teenager know it all. please don't even try to watch this ridiculous series if you do not want to be offended.  this few minutes reminded me of Battle star galactica. Which tried to utilize sex and strong imagery to appeal to the ever growing 1 minute attention span viewers that cannot follow up a story if there is no comedy, sex or action involved every few seconds. but at least they knew how to act other than the spoiled brat attitude acting that reminds me more of a kids movie than anything else.<br /><br /> Sorry but this one was a very expensive disaster and Im glad is not running anymore.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|When I saw the preview of Hunger Games, I wasn't sure about it.  I'm definitely glad I purchased it and would recommend it to everyone!
B0025KVLRO|4.0|This is the Beatles debut album, it hints at what was to come. It's no Revolver or Addy Road, but a great listen never the less.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I have been a fan of Ed for a while now, but I just recently purchased this album. He is amazing!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Revolver is probably the best album ever recorded. Can't believe its from 1966 it sounds so fresh and new. Truly a masterpiece.
B007TMON8M|5.0|My new favorite game.  I'm going to be disappointed when I run out of levels, but as each new level is taking me longer and longer that may be a while.
B0009MAP90|5.0|The first of many many great albums. Bob Dylan's debut has a folk blues feel, with songs by blues legends Booker White and Blind Lemon Jefferson. Strange for a Dylan album is the fact that there are only two songs here by him. Great album
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was first given book 1 as a birthday present on my Kindle. I purchased the 2nd of the trilogy on my own. It was good! I am so glad to see that Christian is changing his ways! I have blushed through many pages in both books, and I wouldn't want anyone to see me while I am reading it, but I have told everyone I know about it! lol can't wait to get book 3!
B000TERHD0|5.0|This album is my instant new favorite.  All of the songs are like little scenes that play out in my head when I hear them.  Her lyrics are smart and funny.  Her voice is wonderful.  And she uses all of her instruments (and voice) in clever ways...shows just how talented she is.  I love how her voice just sort of calmly floats through the songs, which are often rather complex and energetic rhythms and melodies.  Sometimes her voice is almost hip hopping through the song (without at all taking on a rap persona).<br /><br />The weird part for me is that after decades of buying records and CD's, this \\"album\\" is one of the first download-only purchases I have ever made.  I MISS looking through art work, reading lyrics, and wondering who all of those people are that are being credited and thanked in the notes.  iPods and Clouds are cool concepts but mp3's SUCK.  I guess I'm just an old fart.<br /><br />:)
B0073COMUW|1.0|I had ordered 4 bulbs but 3 out of 4 were giving humming sound which was annoying. I returned all.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I read the book first and couldn't put it down so I was excited to watch the movie. But it was nowhere near as interesting or intense as the book. The characters in the movie aren't really built up and much of the significance of certain events isn't relayed.  I highly recommend the book over the film. However,  Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job as katniss.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book was funny and entertaining from the beginning until the very end.  Great story.  Sophie Kinsella is a brilliant author!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app; very easy to use.  I prefer it  to TWC - the info seems more up to date.  Very easy to add locations.
B0000263YY|5.0|I owned the original vinyl and it was crisp and clean. I have also<br />owned previous cd issues of this soundtrack and both were very poor. Low levels and muffled sound were disappointing. This issuance of the Xanadu corrects all mistakes of the past. Crisp, clean and punchy, the way its supposed to be. Xanadu fans...this is the one you want!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I would give this gme 5 stars except the ads are making the ap flake out. Also,  I don't see the reason for needing all of the User information.
B008602KQI|4.0|Perhaps it seemed too realistic or the idea of children killing other children to survive bothered me, but I did not like the movie at first.  Once I focused on the science fiction aspect, I relaxed and got into the story.  Many of the characters seemed over-exaggerated, but that is how the story needs to be told.  The horror of it all permeates through the callousness of the characters in charge in the city.<br /><br />The movie is well acted, has beautiful cinematography, and a good soundtrack.  I am anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.  It was not quite a 5 star movie for me, but still well worth watching and owning.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Catching Fire and the entire Hunger Games series.  Whereas the Hunger Games was a thrilling page turner, Catching Fire builds what goes into social movements and revolutions in a realistic manner, one that sets up Mocking Jay ,the last in the series, nicely.  While this series is often referred to as literature for teen girls, it'a actually a pacifist manifesto of sorts for the 21st Century.  Not only was I surprised, but also challenged and entertained.  BTW, I'm a 50 year old man.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey I went right into 50 Shades Darker, I could not be left hanging like that and not know where we were going.  This one was a page turner I finished it faster than the first one.  Ms. James kept us on our toes in this one and slowly began to peel back the layers of Christian.  I LOVED IT!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|wow great better than the face book game. lots of fun. keeps you on your toes. great puzzle. ran out of words.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read many many books of erotica.  Christian Grey is hands down my favorite male counterpart.  The book is exciting and evocative, and I will read it more than once. I have recommended it to more than just a few friends.  This is a MUST read for men and women.
B003XYERRM|5.0|The author brings to life the tumultuous, double dealing times at the close of the Middle Ages. Richard III wasn't the misshapen depraved  monster as depicted by Shakespeare.  He was a king living in an insecure murderous time where friends and foes were not constrained by moral virtues.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Right now, I cannot give any Team Lava or Storm8 game a good review because they keep raising the prices of items on their games! Some as much as 200%! This is totally ridiculous and at least 1/3 of all players are boycotting until Team Lava lowers the prices back down! There is no reason for them to raise prices so much! THEY ARE JUST GREEDY! I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS OR ANY TEAM LAVA 'STORY' GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE $$ TO BURN!
B006LXQID8|5.0|The quintessential film for any veteran or n00b of foreign films. Whimsical, delightful, colorful - it will win over anyone :)

0385344228|4.0|Parents will do whatever it takes to protect their children from physical harm or to defend them from anyone, or anything, that otherwise threatens their wellbeing.  That is a given; it is just what we do - even for our adult children.  But what if a parent suspects that a son or daughter might have committed a violent crime against someone else's child?  And what if that parent is the District Attorney charged with prosecuting the very crime his son has been accused of committing?<br /><br />First District Attorney Andy Barber, facing precisely that \\"what if\\" question, never hesitates.  Jacob is the most important thing in Andy's life, and if Andy has to place his own future in jeopardy in order to save his son's life, well, that is what he will do.<br /><br />One of Jacob Barber's classmates, a 14-year-old boy, has been found stabbed to death along one of the walkways of the park that numerous students cross on their way to the middle school every morning.  Andy Barber, once he gets over the shock of such a thing happening so close to home, is determined to find and prosecute the murderer as quickly as possible.  He recognizes the fear and unease of his friends and neighbors and believes that moving quickly will help restore the community's sense of security and normalcy.<br /><br />However, Andy and Laurie Barber receive an even bigger shock when their son is arrested for the murder and Andy is forced to take a leave of absence from the District Attorney's office.  As the investigation evolves, the Barbers and the parents of the dead boy will learn things about their sons they never could have imagined.  They will also learn things about themselves and their neighbors that are almost as disturbing as what is revealed about the boys.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is a classic courtroom thriller that will remind the reader of earlier novels like Presumed Innocent and A Time to Kill, two other books that caught the imaginations of readers and sold in huge numbers.  And like the best of his predecessors, William Landay focus on nicely developed characters, plot twists, and a major surprise or two near the end to create a memorable story.  But, even though there are recognizable similarities between Jacob Barber's case and some recent real-world teen-murderers, Defending Jacob is as much a study of family dynamics as it is a legal thriller.<br /><br />The three members of the Barber family, ostracized and hated by their neighbors - every one of whom believe Jacob is the killer - have only each other for support and comfort.  But, as the pressure of the trial mounts, with more and more evidence pointing to Jacob's guilt, Andy and Laurie begin to sense that their son's emotional response to his arrest is odd.  The family's survival is in doubt in more ways than one.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the most memorable character in Defending Jacob is Jacob's grandfather, a man who moves into and out of the picture as the plot develops.  The man's pure evilness certainly makes a lasting impression; for me, one even more striking than that made by Andy Barber's decision to place his son's life above the very justice system he has spent a lifetime serving.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is probably a little bit over-hyped but it has its moments and will certainly be enjoyed by courtroom drama fans.  Warner Brothers has already optioned the book, so read it before the movie spoils it for you.like the best of his predecessors, William Landay focus on nicely developed characters, plot twists, and a major surprise or two near the end to create a memorable story.

B000NQRE1E|3.0|I was VERY disappointed in the audio quality of the Blue Ray.  The dialogue is so low that you can barely distinguish what is being said while the music and some of the sound effects will blow you away.  It's impossible to set the volume and watch the movie.  Maybe I just have a bad disc.  I'm curious to know if others had this problem.  The picture was very good though.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites.  I do understand how frustrating it can be to get stuck on one puzzle, but that's where strategy comes in. I restarted the game twice before I made it all the way through, but that just magnified the feeling of accomplishment when I finally  reached the end. If you are both a puzzle freak and incredibly stubborn, this game is worth every penny.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love this album! Its rare to find a cd where you can't decide which is your favorite track because you have so many! Can't wait for their next release.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book! It not only tells a great story about the author's experiences with the SEALS and the raid on the compound but shows that these guys are human too.
B001VS46DC|5.0|I'm surprised by the posters who compare this to the \\"Live in Paris\\" concert and find it lacking.  It's just a different format .. obviously a much smaller arena, people around cocktail tables.  I found it to be a much more intimate performance and the Rio crowd was into it:  singing along, applauding when she sung in Portugese.  I wish i had been there to watch it.  Well done Diana
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite pass time games. I will refer this game to anyone. Very relaxing and calming of the mind.

0439023521|5.0|Of course I'm pleased with this book and how it sets itself up for the trilogy. Of course the book is better than the movie, b/c the movie left out so small details. Can't wait to start on the next one.

I cant help myself but pin a load of stuff a day. the pins are in catagories now which also helps if u don't no wut to search for. AWESOME app. I recommend it
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Just picked this up on release day,and have listened to it several times through....volume cranked up high,and yes,oh yes,the Boys are Back!!<br /> All of the songs are just fantastic,and I say this as one of the biggest ZZ Top fans on the Face of the Earth.I have every ZZ album ever made,and this one shoots right up to the top of the list.<br /> All of the grooves you'd expect are here,\\"more of the same\\",as another reviewer mentioned----and there's not a thing wrong with that!!<br /> Money well spent--and sure better than 99.9% than anything else out there.This CD will shake your walls,rattle the windows,just like the ZZ we all know and love---Awesome-----that's the only word for this release!!<br /> No need to compare this to all the other great albums.The past is the past---be thankful ZZ can still put out one helluva great album!<br /> Put it in and enjoy!!
0062502182|4.0|The Alchemist struck me as a very moralistic and inspiring book, yet repetitive.<br />  In the book, Paulo Coelho uses the obstacles Santiago encounters during his journey to show how pursuing your dreams may not always be so pleasent. Thus revealing, you have to struggle sometimes to get to your own treasure. The thought of living out your dreams and never giving up, which is brought up alot in the book, is very inspiring. But, it is enforced almost too much. For example, when the boy wants settle down at the oasis; the alchemist strongly enforced that he continue on to The Pyramids. Santiago was happy with were he was at along his journey but was convinced to move on. Another time the repetition of finishing your journey came up was in the beginning of the book when all the boy's money was taken from him. He could've just stayed in town but yet again was encouraged to keep going.<br />  Although I personally appreciated the positive morals, like never giving up or accepting challenges, the book made it seem like thats all that matters in life. For example, the alchemist tells the boys to leave Fatima at the oasis and come back for her after he has success. Indeed it is important to go after your own prosperity, but the book leaves out the fact its also important to stick with the ones you love. Which I personally feel is a big deal.<br />  Overall, I enjoyed the adventures and suprising events throughout the book. It taught me to always follow my dreams and that everyone has a purpouse in life. Even thought it was very unrealistic, the ideas always tied into a learning experiece. I recomend this book if your looking for a little life lesson but don't mind if it's a little over the top in the way of teaching it.

0525953728|2.0|I agree with Pentagon General Counsel Jeh Johnson, this book should have been viewed by military censors. From the elaborate schematics of OBL's compound in Abbotabad to the disclosure of a clandestine operative named \\"Jen\\" to the disclosure of 85 dead SEALS gratuitously outed at the end of this book. The reasons that he wrote it may change, he wrote it for them or for those who died in 9/11 or so people know what SEALS go through in training, which there is precious little of in this book. Actually, the book is so devoid of substance, the prologue repeats almost word for word what is in Chapter 12 but there are plenty of code words and descriptions that should have been omitted. I'm not sure why he wrote this book but i'm sure of the answer as to whether it should have been written, clearly not.

George is shown testing the product for its authenticity and quality.<br /><br />George Jung (Johnny Depp), moves to California with his friend and they meet an airline stewardess, Barbara (Franka Potente) who introduces him to the main drug dealer Derek Foreal (Paul Rubens).  They go into the drug business and they make a ton of money while learning the business of selling pot.  George is into smuggling pot big time and he opens up a ring back in Boston where they came from on the advice of a friend who says the colleges are a hot market.  They use stewardesses as mules but they sell so much they can't even carry enough with both of their suitcases full.  He becomes known as Boston George, the pot dealer.<br /><br />They bypass source and go directly to Mexico to stop buying retail and to buy the drugs directly from the Mexican dealers.  He gets hooked up with the right guys finally and they start flying small planes across the border loaded with pot.  He plans on marrying Barbara but he gets caught with 660 pounds of pot and faces going to prison for 2 years. Barbara is dying of cancer and he skips bail to stay with her until she dies.  He is caught at his parent's home by the DEA after his mom turns him in and he has to serve his time.<br /><br />While in prison he learns about the cocaine business......<br /><br />This is an intriguing movie based on a true story.  George Jung makes over $100 million smuggling cocaine but his life is hard as he spends time in jail and his personal life is a wreck.  He is always facing betrayal from his drug partners and the life is dangerous.<br /><br />This is a good movie and it is worth watching.  Johnny Depp does a great job in this movie and it is one of his best roles.  Depp just plays the cool drug dealer, even when going through customs.  The acting of the cast of this movie all meshed together and made this a great movie.  This is an interesting story and worth watching.

B0089IGUP4|5.0|Here's one of those albums that really took time to grow on me. Upon it's release, the hype was up, way up; I was expecting something to blow my mind with originality, creativity, and catchiness! Did all that live up when I bought it and listened to it? No.<br /><br />I did however instantly fall in love with the closing song \\"National Anthem\\", that is such a great song, it's alomst impossible not to like it. But, the rest of the album left me feeling quite underwhelmed. Honestly though, I felt that with some of their older material as well. It's the darnest thing! I know they are good song writers/musicians and I like the voice, but the albums were always something I just kind of liked, never getting too excited.<br /><br />Listened to \\"Handwritten\\" about three times all the way through, and still just kind of felt underwhelmed. I hate hype, it usually destroys something great upon first listen, or honors something terrible, making you search and search for what is good in it, even though it's a wild goosechase.<br /><br />Turns out this album is the former though, for sure. The loads of hype \\"Handwritten\\" recieved didn't allow me to just listen to it with fresh ears. If someone would have told this was a terrible album, I would have had the opposite reaction, \\"Oh but it's sooo Great, just listen!\\"<br /><br />Putting the album on as background music one day I began to find myself repeating every track one by one as they played, then again, hearing something new and interesting each time; like the great guitar delay effect on 'Mae', or the lyrics \\"All of my hero's were failures and ghosts\\" from 'Biloxi Parish'. These little things began to come out of the wood work, and get stuck in my head. In fact each track I listened to had something. Then it hit me, this is a fantastic album, very much unlike most of the rock and roll albums floating around today. Here's a band writting memorable hooks, with interesting lyrics, a unique voice, and great musicianship! And, an album that is great from start to finish, probably enjoyed most when played in full. Now I can't stop listening, I'm excited about this one!<br /><br />Just listen and enjoy, put all the hype aside, though ironically they do deserve it for this piece of work!<br /><br />Absolutely one of the best things I've heard this year

B0001CNRS4|5.0|Have teenage grandchildren and this gives them an idea of how things can change with just one moment.  Never take anything for granted.  Be upfront with people.  Money never is the answer for a happy life or anything else.  Very entertaining, the teens loved it.  Have an 8 year old greatgrandson and he was really impressed with the Hip-Hop and now tries to do every move 'Honey' was teaching. I know he wasn't supposed to watch it but it's kinda hard to keep it away from him when he can see and hear any of these \\"inappropriate things\\" every day, on TV and Radio.  He's quite aware of these \\"inappropriate things\\".  Children today are much more aware of these things more than we want him to be. So every time he hears, sees or says anything we tell him to come to us first before he repeats or tells anyone else.  So far he has and we can explain things in a way that he can understand them at his age level.
B00004CX4M|4.0|There's a fight in town! A gun fight among the best around and the winner gets bragging rights that they are the best, $123,000 in cash and they also get to live, maybe.  The $123,000 is compliments of Mr. Herod and Wells Fargo and the cash is still in the stolen Wells Fargo cash box.<br /><br />As the movie begins a woman rides into town.  The town of Redemption is hosting the gunfight and the woman is Ellen (Sharon Stone).  She walks into the bar asking for a room and she is told to go next door where the women of ill repute work.  She teaches the bar tender a quick lesson and gets her room.<br /><br />John Herod (Gene Hackman) runs the town and takes 50% of the money from all of the businesses.  As the town fills up with killers and gunslingers the tension in town escalates to a peak of frenzy.  The lady has a mission on her mind to seek revenge for the death of her father.  The gunfighters are paired off against each other with the winner advancing and the losers dying.  Each person who enters the contest has to fight once a day. They can challenge whoever they want and the time of the fight will be pulled from a hat.  The fighters are from around the world and include army men, the Swedish champion, an Indian, professional gunslingers, a preacher and just plain killers.  Even Mr. Herod puts his name on the list of fighters.  He even sees his son, the Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio), is signed up to fight.<br /><br />Cort ( Russell Crowe) is the preacher and Mr. Herod wants him to be in the fight for his own reasons and he is signed up against his will while hanging from the ceiling of the bar....<br /><br />This movie is filled with a star filled cast and the action is very good.  Because they have to fight once a day the action is fast and furious. The gunplay is good and the dialog is well written.  Every gun player has a serious attitude and they don't mind the verbal conflict as well as the actual gun combat.<br /><br />This is an entertaining movie and you should watch it.  I recommend it to you.watch it.  I recommend it to you.
0345803485|2.0|I will keep this short as there are a number of negative things I have to say about this book. First, I am very open minded and nonjudgemental, so my opinion of this series is NOT due to any sort of disgust for the Dom/Sub subject.  Second, I have thoroughly enjoyed other \\"fad series\\" that have come out. But not this one.<br /><br />I am still trying to get through book one of Fifty Shades. I am towards the end now and this book is dragging for me. I didn't expect any sort of literary genius, but I'm tired of reading the words \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"my subconscience.\\" Does Ms. Steele have multiple personality disorder? She would be a perfect fit for Christian who evidently suffers from Bipolar Disorder. I find the inner dialogue Ana has with herself is a bit much. I find it distracting, annoying and terribly redundant. And the contract - her decision making process is painfully slow to the point of making this book dreadfully boring.<br /><br />I am trying to see this book as plain entertainment, but am finding even that to be difficult.

0547564651|5.0|Following the footsteps of Jonathan Kozol, Paul Tough employs his significant storytelling abilities to help readers see and feel the plight of children, families and communities trapped in cycles of failure and poverty. How Children Succeed challenges some conventional wisdom on causes of failure (poverty, teacher quality) and contends that nurturing character in children and young adults is the key to success. As a former NYC Teaching Fellow who has lived and worked in multiple communities of cyclical poverty, I'm convinced that Tough has nailed some critical pieces of breaking those cycles.<br /><br />Here is the argument in brief:<br />==============================<br />There exists in our society a troubling and growing achievement gap between the have and the have-nots. The cause of that gap is neither merely poverty nor IQ, but a specific set of non-cognitive skills including executive function and conscientiousness, which Tough calls \\"character.\\" Children who acquire these skills can break historic cyclical patterns of failure.<br /><br />Malleability of Character and Intelligence<br />==========================================<br />Whereas IQ is hardly malleable, executive function and character strengths - specifically grit, self-control, zest, social intelligence, gratitude, optimism, curiosity and conscientiousness - are far more malleable. These skills are better predictors of academic performance and educational achievement than IQ and therefore ought to be the direct target of interventions.<br /><br />Attachment and Lifelong Health<br />==============================<br />Tough sees two key areas of influence for those who care for those trapped in cycles of poverty. The first is secure early attachment to parents. \\"The effect of good parenting is not just emotional or psychological, the neuroscientists say; it is biochemical\\" (28). Specifically, children who experience high levels of stress but NOT responsive and nurturing parents suffer from a range of lifelong health and mental health issues. However, \\"When mothers scored high on measures of responsiveness, the impact of those environmental factors on their children seemed to almost disappear\\" (32). Tough cites one study in which \\"early parental care predicted which students would graduate even more reliably than IQ or achievement test scores\\" (36). Importantly, interventions that focus on promoting stronger parent-child relationships in high risk groups (including one in which just 1 of 137 infants studied demonstrated secure attachment at the outset) have shown promising impact. Of the 137 children in the study, 61% of those in the treatment group formed secure attachment by age 2, compared with only 2% of the control group.<br /><br />Adolescent Character Formation<br />==============================<br />Paul Tough highlights the work of school and support programs that intentionally focus on forming the character strength habits that enable children to learn well in schools, form healthy relationships, and avoid the destructive decisions and behavior patterns modeled in their communities. Here, too, Tough sees a ray of hope. Just as early intervention with parents and young children yields wide ranging benefits for families in poverty, so character interventions in adolescence can and do enable young adults surrounded by cycles of poverty to learn self-control, perseverance and focus that are critical for escaping the gravitational pull of their communities.<br /><br />Why You Should Read This Book<br />=============================<br />Paul Tough is tackling one of the most challenging - and contentious - issues of our time. His analysis will offend those who tend to blame poverty predominantly on the irresponsible choices of the poor by showing just how powerful the cyclical, environmental pressures are on children raised in these communities. His work is just as challenging to those who think that those trapped in cycles of poverty are mere victimsof their environment who bear no responsibility for their decisions. Tough shows compellingly that parents and children in poverty can and do overcome the powerful environmental forces of their communities - and that this is a beautiful and essential component of breaking cyclical poverty. His call is for those with education and influence - the kinds of people who read books like his - to demonstrate motivation and volition (two components of character formation he extols) to recognize, celebrate, and nurture the character of children and families in poverty.<br /><br />Graham Scharf<br />Author, The Apprenticeship of Being Human: Why Early Childhood Parenting Matters to Everyone<br />[...]of their environment who bear no responsibility for their decisions.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Loved Serenity. The character development was true to each character. Hated to see Firefly end, this helped filled the void. Definitely watch the Director's Cut!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was good. It was not as good as the first 2 books but it did keep my interest for every page. 2 thumbs up.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Best Book I have read in a very long time. If you love history mixed with Witches, Vampires, and Daemons, you will love this book
0553328255|5.0|I've just started reading this set, and I am the kind who doesn't read very much (outside of textbooks), and I am very intrigued by it already! My only down side is since I am a slower reader, and it feels like a bit of a \\"tough read\\" for me.  Otherwise, I love that it is challenging my vocab and sharpening my skills! (not to mention keeping my interest high) =)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the openness of the face of this calculator.  It's like having an actual machine.  Fits my Kindle perfectly.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|easy to use,  simple to understand,  passes time quickly when stuck or bored. I like the different levels and how I can challenge myself in times.
B00846TRHY|3.0|As usual Gerard Butler is incredible. The movie itself though was too disgusting, without purpose, and not well connected. It seemed a glorification of the \\"preacher\\" rather than a full multifaceted character. The wife was too was unreal in her mellowness. Seriously, your drug addict violent crime-prone husband comes home from prison and you don't have a concern in the world because you found God? No worries for your young daughter? And what is up with his drug addict friend living in his house (while druggin out) when he was in Africa for months at a time. What saintly woman would put up with that? It's just not real. This movie could have been much better. The topic is interesting and enlightening. Too bad. I will NEVER watch this again or recommend it. But I did get something out of it....so it's 3 stars.
0743233832|5.0|Excellent ideas concerning how to overcome adversity & how our interpretations of situations affects our view of the event.  I think this little book is worth its weight in gold.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|The Book of Revelation this is NOT for those likely to assume the movie is an adequate description of events portrayed there.  It is better viewed as hyperbolic post-modernism in which Nostradamas quatrains are integrated into a fixed calendar endpoint a la Mayan.  So, it's the atypical neutrino behavior that is behind the Earth's crust/core overheating and subsequent liquifaction/shift?  Nonscientists in the audience can be duped into believing this is a plausible scenario which is why Hollywood uses it as its point of departure.<br /><br />And, how about the competing themes in the movie; one espoused by the geologist in which 'representative genetic stock is selected for salvation' and the other by the crass former US presidential Chief of Staff '1 billion euros per ticket, after all we're not running a charity'?  This interplay/confusion mars the script in that the audience is left to labor under a false dichotomy pressurized by the faux &#34;crisis&#34; created by the dreaded 'End of the World'.  In fact, no one knows how this interplay would work out in fact; yet, we have examples from our own history from both 9.11.2001 response and hurricane Katrina.  Likely, short term, the fallen nature of man would be plainly evident, but what if altruism was removed entirely from the equation?  This is the view of Revelation, when fallen man is left completely to his/her own devices without the restraint of altruistic urges.<br /><br />The only couple of whimsical touches in the movie is casting the actual Buddist llama of Nepal to represent himself and the attempt on the part of common Tibetans to claim a right of stowaway passage abord an exclusive, wealth- and superiority-driven Ark.
0375507256|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I'm not even sure why I'm trying to critique it at all.  The technical side of the book, with the author's nifty modes of speech is stunning/amazing.  The best apart of the book, however, is the message it brings to the reader and our possibly future.  The underlying concept of meeting the same people over and over, throughout your many lives is another aspect that brings the reader to examine their own lives.  This is an important book and I look forward to seeing how it is translated to film. That said, I can't imagine how they will make the movie as enthralling as the book.  So if you are going to see the movie, keep that in mind.  I'm not sure if I have done the right thing in reading the book first.  I have loaned it to my sister, but plan to reread it when she is finished.  I'm sure there will be new discoveries waiting for me at the second reading.  Don't worry, just BUY THIS BOOK and enjoy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't Put it down! Brilliant! Showed the male vs female perceptions of every<br />situation. It is amazing how different we see things.  Well done!
0399159029|5.0|I am writing this review more than a month afer I read the book, and the impact of this  book is still fresh in my mind.  This book is brilliantly written, set in the time of the holocaust and strangely enough the hero is not one of the opressed but rather an opressor.  What I liked about this book was how vividly you felt their life down to bites of food in a time when food was scarce.  The mystery was really well set up too but in the interest of not having any spoilers, I will say only that another great social double standard and prejudice is exposed beyond the genocide that permeates and informs every scene of the book.  This is not a preachy book either. It still manages to be an entertaining thriller.
B000ZMCVRI|4.0|Has all the essential marley, great for chillaxin'. A staple for anybody's collection. Nice dinner music with friends. Or for lazy summer afternoons.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|This was not the role that Kristen Stewart was ment to play. Add to that, several plot holes, and some borrowed scene's and you have a very bad movie, I almost gave it 2 out of 5 is due to the cosuming and costars performances, but in the end I felt it was not enought to pull up the rateing.
