B004LWZW7Y|5|This is by far one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.  Puss totally dominates the big screen.  I hope there is a sequel!
B005GFPZYK|5|It is like being listening him to talk, telling his adventures, his views. I can imagine how nice should be sitting by his side, with some friends, a beer... and have him telling all this. I can accept what happened to him. At home, somebody he was trying to help. He did not have a chance...
B000000OQF|5|&quot;Appetite&quot; is one of the greatest rock albums on all times.  I don't think its fair that some people chose to rate this album based on Axl's personality; the rating should be on the music, and it doesn't get  any better than this!  Axl's voice is absolutely amazing; he has such a  range that its almost impossible to believe its the same person singing.  I  don't think there are any &quot;worthless&quot; tracks on this CD, they all  rock.  In time, they all will grow to become favs.   Even now, 12 years  after its release, I listen to it all the time.  Few bands will ever be  able to put out an album this great.  Its a shame that GNR split up;  separately, they won't attain the level of success they had as a band.  For  anyone that wasn't fortunate enough to see the original lineup in concert,  I feel for you.  A live show doesn't get much better than that.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|My son loves this game and I can see why.  So many levels, cars, and options.  Plus it's not like other games where you have to buy, buy, buy credits all the time.  They let you earn coins in competitions.  Nice!
B000JMKTLO|4|quite a page turner, waiting to see who dunnit great story line very different !! hoping to see more books by this author she knows how to keep the reader engrossed
0064400557|5|What an absolutely great story. In this story you will encounter sacrifice, love, friendship, hate, rejection, rebirth, both within the animal society and the human society. The similarities between both societies are quite evident. I simply loved this story and will always read it over and over again.
0393343405|1|Ok, I admit it. I really don't get The Swerve. It was an unusual topic for me - the rediscovery of a long ancient poem whose ideas led to the development of the modern world. It won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, so it seemed promising. All I can think of is the scholarship behind it was admired (pages of citations at the end), or the judges were enamored with the concept - the power of ideas as the engine of change.<br />As for me, except for one cogent chapter explaining the key precepts of the poem, I found the narrative unorganized and prone to unnecessary wanderings. Merely to prove that later luminaries cited the work and adopted some or all of its beliefs does not prove this poem had such an outsized impact. Development of HOW the poem's ideas were applied to change the modern world would have made for a far more interesting read.<br />Unless you are a real humanities geek and would like to explore further, avoid this book.
B0001US62I|5|Angel Heart is one of the best morphs of the picture genres of drama and horror on the market.  Alan Parker does an excellent job with a film that is pure story telling, in the tradition of Polanski and Friedkin before him.  Its a film that rivets you with excellent cinematography, acting, and clues big and small. <br /> <br />One of the major attractions to watching Angel Heart is following along with Mickey Rourke's Harry Angel in piecing together all the clues.  This viewing attraction will most likely be amiss for new viewers because Amazon placed a major spoiler in the synop. <br /> <br />Why?  Two thumbs down to Amazon for revealing \\"the ending\\" to a great story that would otherwise send chills down your spine.
B0013TXA5Y|5|Clary just saw a murdered in a crowded club in New York City. The only problem is that no one else seems to have been able to see it. Except for those who did the killing, and now they seem very interested in Clary and her ability to see what others can't. Soon Clary is taken into another world, full of demons and magic. But can Clary handle this world or will she want her old one back?    I will admit that I tried to read this book once before and had to stop because the beginning is very boring. However, after a friend told me I should chug through, I got past the slow beginning and the story started to pick up and become so engrossing I couldn't put the book down. I then went on to devour the rest of the series. This book is highly recommended for those with imagination and the free time to read a book because it will be extremely hard to put this book down once you start (or at least get past the beginning few chapters).    *5 STARS*    [...]

B00G6ZTM3Y|5|It's so much money and I don't know how to fight the wall of fleash
1607747308|5|I am a chronic organizer.  But this book dives deeper than just logistics. It is not heavy into psychology, but as you read the book it becomes clear what the author is really getting at.  She focuses on keeping the things you like, not on getting rid of things, e.g., you should only have 7 blouses.  She anthropomorphizes items, which may seem foreign to us in the West, but it makes sense, what she says.  I really never had a problem purging stuff, but the sentimental stuff was more difficult.  She made it simple.  I have donated 1/3 of all my books, but the focus is on &#34;I'm keeping what I love, and getting rid of things that make me sad, or I'm done with.&#34;  She has a beautiful way of looking at things that maybe you bought and you have never used, when you bought the item, the process of purchasing it brought you joy.  So you can get rid of it, if you no longer need it, because it did give you joy and now its purpose is done.  Awesome book, especially for analyticals!
B000096IBI|5|More a silent film with sound than a sound film-- and replete with Chaplins signature visual gags and set pieces-- this title works as initial exposure to Chaplin for kids, with Goddard  an adorable foil.
B00J2PFPVI|5|Lovely and engaging story for all ages that makes you laugh out loud. Love the message about act of true love between sisters rather than saved by a prince.

B00AE9UYJ4|5|Slender Man! Chapter 1: Alone is the second best app (apart from Minecraft PE)  ever!!!  Was playing it on the \\"farm\\" mode and for three signs,  he never appeared. But then BOOM BADDA BOOM he appeared on my trail to the graves. He kept on emerging in front of me,  but failure for him!  If he even is a guy!  It isn't that scathe but if you do not like being pwned or if you really have weak constitutions,  don't even press buy. But in the nd of my farm episode,  I won. Cool. Well don't just stand there reading this... get this game or be a s***!
B00DUGCLY4|4|Challenging at times, great to bring out with friends, I've enjoyed this game quite a bit. It's free to play, but beware, it's SO tempting to buy answers when it gets tough.

B008NABUU8|3|Load times are in the 4 second range on Evo Lte.  Fine by me.  Considering how bridge pieces snap into pre defined grid slots,  controls are adequate,  but not genre defining.  Eager to see what improvements the Dev can incorporate.
B00K9V2OPE|5|I was hesitant at first to read what I consider a taboo -teacher/student romance but the book was offered free so I bought it.<br />Oh, I'm so glad I did. Loving Mr. Daniels was such a beautiful story the trials and tragedies that both Daniel and Ashlynn endure prior, during and after they met and yet their love remain strong.
B000P0J0EW|5|Unlike most great film this one truly gets better throughout its duration. There is never a lull in the story and in fact the film actually climaxes at the very last scene. The acting, story, direction and music in this film is perfect.  I've seen thousands of films but this is my favorite without a doubt. Whenever I need something to pick me up or give hope I simply watch this film. Every time I watch it I still feel the huge power and raw emotion this film possesses. I cannot state this any clearer. This is the greatest movie of all time.
B000002G89|5|As with most of Clapton's albums, this has a good mix of blues and rock. The only thing that I can really say that is disappointing about these Clapton remasters, is that, unlike other remastered classics, we get no bonus tracks of any kind. I am sure that most fans would have wanted something extra to get their teeth into. And as a marketing move, it's a way for record companies to get true blue fans to fork out the money to replace their older copies if they are to get extra previously unreleased tracks. Maybe I should apply for a job there! But, that aside, this is a great album in true Clapton style. 3 songs are Clapton originals, and of course there is the Bob Marley hit &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; which introduced a lot of people to the reggae sound. Not a weak song on this album, but then again, this is a Clapton album. Recommended!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Cried, cried and cried through out most of this book. On the train. By myself.
B002QE3CTY|5|Pretty addicting. Gets you hooked to read the next chapter every time.
B00FATEJYE|5|Awesome game highly recommend you get to play as multiple dc characters and it is a blast to play as them.
B000000YNZ|4|This filled in a gap in my Bill Evans collection and shows him at his most introspective. His own tunes - Very Early and Re: Person I knew bracket some great ballad standards. Chuck Israels and Paul Motian provide sensitive support and swing. It's difficult to give any recording of Evans a low score and I'd rate this at 4 and a half stars.
B0050DZ8J0|3|Not much different than online but smaller screen to view results.
B008Y2FRFO|5|I love the game! when I run out of coins I quit for couple hours. I never had to pay for anything on this gsme
B004FRX0MY|1|I liked this app until I discovered that it cannot be set to store downloaded mp3's to the SD card. This essentially renders the application useless for its advertised purpose. Unfortunately I already subscribed for a year of the premium service. Lesson learned. I hope this review will spare you from making the same mistake.
B0055Q5F36|4|The things that attracted me first about the new Samsung Galaxy SII were  1) Display size   2) It is leek & thin   I wanted to keep things that way. Only well protected. Enter the Otterbox commuter. It allows my phone to be sleek and light thanks to its double layers. Layer one look like a regular gummy wrap plus some odd side bars that protect all the buttons, causing a slight confusion at first glance. Then I noticed a very light plastic outer layer that when used together, makes for a surprisingly thin yet sturdy pkg. I get LOTS of kudos for my find. It really looks like a batman like application. I love it and the price was right to boot!
B00000JLEP|2|Once you've heard Svetlanov conducting this piece, with nothing less than an absolutely volcanic passion, and then Gergiev's performance which doesn't lag far behind in terms of sheer voluptuousness, you are forever spoilt for the kind of \\"gentlemanly\\" music making as Boulez produces here. Heaven bless the Chicago Symphony, but hiring this metronome-besotted time beater was a huge mistake, explained only by a prestige that induces many people to shot their ears when they don't like what they hear - after all, this is the \\"great\\" Boulez! It does remind me, sorry to say, of the tale of the Emperor's clothes.<br />All the performances on this album are marked by a reticence and indeed tiredness which stands at the opposite end of an apposite approach. This is Scriabin, after all, a musical revolutionary, seeking to enlarge the expressive power of music by a new harmonic language and highly differentiated instrumental colours. With due allowances made for the fin de siecle temper that infested others as well (Busoni, Schoenberg, Mahler etc.), a good way of thinking of this music is of a creative mind seeking to burst open the thinning skin of traditional forms and harmony. In short, this music represents part of an adventure, a journey of discovery, and it wasn't driven by politeness, but by impulsiveness, impetuosity, impatience and a talent for the exotic and extraordinary.<br />Boulez, himself a radical in his youth, seems to have turned progressively into a fossil as he made increasing forays into the classical repertoire. Those who remember the excitement of his earlier years, when his Bartok, Ravel and Debussy were still revelatory, will groan with dismay at this colourless, uninvolved, stale exhibition of conductorial expertise. Even Ormandy, by no means at home in Scriabin, turned in a more apt performance for RCA. So now we have Poem of Ecstasy without ecstasy, a Poem of Fire without fire and a Piano Concerto that sounds for all the world like a youthful essayof Chopin.<br />I have my doubts that this is what the world needed.

031606792X|5|It has been a while since I was so enthralled in a book series. This series is awesome and left me wanting more. Too many people are too criticalinstead of letting their imaginations take over. This book allowed me to do so. It is such a beautiful story of love and devotion with just enough drama to keep you hooked. It would be wonderful if more books were written in this series. I would love to know more about the characters lives.

1455521205|2|I had recently heard that David Baldacci now has a team of people writing his books for him. Two things seem to support that notion - 3 books out in one year, and the poor quality of his last few efforts. I loved his earlier books, but I probably won't be buying any more new ones.
B000003N8R|5|I bought this a couple of years ago while I was on vacation in Vancouver. I was at a record store, when I spotted this one. I bought it. I listened, and came to conclusion that it was probably his best. The title track especially is awesome. It's 8+ minutes of killer saxophone, as only Coltrane can deliver.    Other highlights for me on this Coltrane epic include 'The Drum Thing,' 'Bessie's Blues,' and 'Wise One.' This was released on the Impulse label, which was purchased by MCA years ago. The sound quality on the remastered disc is simply amazing.    If you enjoyed this Coltrane record, check these out:    A Love Supreme-Impulse  Blue Train-Blue Note  Giant Steps-Atlantic  My Favorite Things-Atlantic  With Thelonious Monk-Verve    This is highly recommended. Check out his best compilation too, 'Ken Burns JAZZ Collection.'     ENJOY!!!
B004Q7DQLS|3|....how I determine that I enjoyed a book...<br /><br />NO:  Am I glad that I PAID for the book?<br />YES:  Was there good and realistic CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?<br />YES:  Was the PLOT logical and/or interesting?<br />NO:  Would I buy the AUDIOBOOK or REREAD the story because I enjoyed it so much?<br /><br />The characters and universe are so similar you start to think the two series are written by the same person.<br /><br />The only difference is that instead of angels with Guild Hunter, you have flying beasties like dragons, griffins and harpies.
B001N44BVQ|4|At first I was not sure where the story was going, then I got plunged in a lot of intrigues and lies. Di Caprio and Crowe were superb! Would have liked for the story to continue!    If you like thrillers and packed action movies, this one is for you: you won't be disappointed.
B0051T47NQ|4|Norwegian humor tends to be subtle, but this one is hilarious.  Helpful, but not necessary, to have<br />any familiarity with Scandinavian culture.  If you're from Minnesota, you hardly need to read the<br />subtitles even though the dialogue is in Norwegian.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Awesome gadget. Got rid of Comcast TV. Should have gotten this sooner. I recommend this to anyone wanting to free themselves from cable TV
B0040I09RM|3|I dunno why, but it just doesn't grab me.  It's fiction, so of course it seems &#34;unrealistic&#34;, but some fiction doesn't, and that's what I like.
B0051ANPZQ|5|Adults and kids should read this book.  Auggie's differences are visible to everyone.  All he needs is for people to treat him like anyone else.  A great book to start a conversation about tolerance and kindness.  The world would be a better place if we could all just be a little kinder.
B004XWLN20|5|Series is great. Although the shipping was done very good and on time but like others I have some beefs with the set itself. The discs are jammed in their sleeves and like everyone else I hope they aren't scratched or damaged but time will tell as it will take some time to get thru the 62 discs. But I was lucky to get them at the one day only cost of $114.00 and you can't go wrong with that.
B00CNQ7CRI|3|Last year when I went back to the UK for a visit I saw the release of this book with a fan fare, then nothing, no mention of it in the US market. So I already figured the book was a bust.<br />I related to the character being of a similar age and at the same stage of life (then I was a 30's single living in London, now I'm a middle aged mother living in So Cal), but come on! --Spoiler Alert-- Husbands don't regularly die - I guess she had to kill him off because divorce wouldn't work with the Happy Ever After of the last book. But how about making a HOOT and HOWL wife/mother? (Husband Out Of Town or Husband Out Working Late). That way Mark would be alive but away and she still can get up to antics just not sexual ones.<br />The thought of a mother bringing strange men into her home with small kids is appalling to me, and the whining about never finding anyone. Middle Aged Mommies know that their kids are number one in their lives and that the focus shifts to raising them which of course takes up all their time (Ask any husband, oh that's right he's away on business!)<br />By the end of the book I felt it was like reading a list, it just seemed like Fielding was tying up the lose ends and few of them made sense. I notice a lot of &#34;product placement&#34; and wondered about that. Also someone needs to tell her that folk don't normally Tweet they Facebook or Instagram. I was able to borrow the kindle book from my local library so when I was disappointed with the book at least it didn't cost me anything.
B0031YJFCQ|5|This third book in the series did not disappoint.  A fabulous book.  I will recommend this book to everybody I know who enjoys reading a great thriller.
B002AOWXQ8|5|This album is amazing. I dare you to listen to it and not become instantly joyful. What an amazing band. Buy this album and support them!
B003J27WFW|5|Beyond the Lighted Stage isn't your typical rock band documentary; it does more than just tell a story. While watching this fantastic documentary, I was in awe at how these guys conduct themselves, either on the stage or off. For those who already know a great deal of their history, there have never been stories of a band member (or members) trashing their hotel room with a sledgehammer, scandals, drug busts, or anything else that is pretty typical of rock stars. Geddy, Alex, and Neil are well-spoken, not arrogant, and just 'regular guys' who love to make music for their fans, who, by the way, are the most loyal you'll ever see. Why does Rush have such a loyal fan base? Perhaps it's because Rush have been slighted by critics and kicked around for 40 years, which doesn't sit well with fans. Or, it could be that fans respect their unwillingness to cave into being something they're not, such as 'selling out' for the record company or to the tune of way more money via chart-topping hits. Even after the very precarious period (1975) of not selling many copies of Caress of Steel, they still stuck to their guns and made another epic-length piece (2112). When this album became successful, people started to realize that these guys are real. Finally, I think that Rush fans are endeared to the band because they're there for the fans. Because of everything I mentioned, it's no mystery as to why they've lasted so long together. Most bands are lucky to log 10 years, but Rush has logged more than 40, and are still going strong. The documentary starts with the early childhood of Geddy, Alex and John (Rutsey), the original drummer. They epitomize the grassroots struggle of a local band finding their way in a market (Canada) that wasn't conducive to being noticed by U.S. Labels. Then, via a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio, they got their first break (because of a DJ's bathroom break) when the song Working Man was played. After this, people wanted to hear Rush. Subsequently, the newly-found attention would be the beginning of the end for John Rutsey, who suffered from diabetes, so touring wasn't an option due to his health. Neil Peart auditioned and was given the job, but his presence and songwriting transformed the band into full-fledged progressive rock. I think of Neil Peart as a symbol of quiet confidence; he gave the image of someone who was above all the rock culture nonsense and criticism that's so prevalent even to this day. I've never known him to say,  \\"how come we're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\\" His band mates had the same attitude. Rush have always wanted to be themselves, which alienated critics. But music is about fans and gold and platinum records- NOT what Rolling Stone magazine says. Rolling Stone has finally given Rush their due, most likely because they don't want to lose fans who like Rush. This documentary also touches on tragic events in Peart's life which sidelined the band indefinitely. Rush is a band of attrition, perseverance, and resilience. When they returned to action, they were bigger than ever, thanks to old fans and new legions of fans. This two CD set is a must-have for anyone who appreciates a great story about a great band. The second disc has concert footage included.y-found attention would be the beginning of the end for John Rutsey, who suffered from diabetes, so touring wasn't an option due to his health.

6304602901|4|This is by far the best and most consistently funny of the 7 Police Academy films.  They pretty much got worse as they went on.  Some of the funniest gags take place in this one: Tackleberry going nuts during obstacle training, Harris driving the motorbike into the back of a horse, Hightower tearing the seats out of the car and also flipping one over with his hands, the infamous podium/hooker scene, and of course Mahoney and Jones(the sound effect guy) have several funny scenes.  Fans of the series will want to have this.  The DVD isn't bad for a cheap one.  It includes only the full screen version(bummer), the languages/subtitles(of course), cast and crew bios, interactive menus where you can read facts about the film, a reel recommendations section which suggests another Steve Guttenburg film and other films that are also funny (such as Austin Powers), and a scene selection which is common but welcome.  The best part of the DVD other than the film itself is the inclusion of all 7 theatrical trailers for each Police Academy film.  Genuinely funny and contrary to other reviews, this is no where near the worst film ever made.  See it for yourself many many many times on many many many different occasions (inside Police Academy joke).

B0070Y46UY|5|A  very well written fanciful survival story. As an author myself I commend Mr. Martel for capturing my undivided attention. I will avoid the movie, however, so as not to dilute my fond memory of the hero, Pi. It makes one wish for more of Pi`s life, but not merely a commentary on the original, Pi needs no commentary, but his life must go on. I am eager to see if Mr. Martel can do it again, I certainly hope so.

B0030V0PEW|5|LOVED this book.  Although it's not exactly a step-by-step guide on when and how to create checklists, the book absolutely won me over to the value of using simple checklists both personally and professionally.  I've already seen basic errors from the people I manage at work drop significantly as a result of the checklists we have implemented in a couple of key business areas.<br /><br />Jack Dorsey at Square (also co-founder of Twitter) gives this book to every new hire.

0307269752|3|I'm not into stories of the thriller genre, but I've heard too much about Larsson's trilogy I was convinced it will be well worth a read. The story is not actually centred around a single girl hero: it's about men doing all kind of horrible acts against women, with a central focus on the Vanger's clan - a financially successful family from the outside, but a completely dysfunctional one (with some fascist tendencies) from the inside.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Salinder, the girl with the many tattoos (each one possibly representing a certain traumatic event in her life) have ugly problems with every kind of authority possible: guardian authorities, police authorities, tax authorities, teachers, psychiatrists, and even bars body guards. It's just as if all of these people exist for the only purpose of making her life miserable.<br /><br />Mix all of the above with a financial journalist whose life work is unveiling corruption in Swedish firms and you get a story that cannot be easily put down!<br /><br />Two stars are removed due to the unfortunate bad quality of the English translation, and Salinder's almost-non-existing character development.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun game so far.
B0002F6BRE|5|Sometimes I like Will Ferrell movies and sometimes I don't. I love this one! I don't think there is another actor who could have pulled off this part the way Ferrell did. My family has made it a tradition to watch this movie and Chevy Chase in 'Christmas Vacation' every year. Elf has to be one of the top comedies of all time.

B0034DGPEU|4|The Kitchen  House was historical fiction which I so enjoy.  The story was based  in the the south in the late 1700s to early 1800s and involved slavery and the ways of the Southern plantations. The book moved quickly and I found that I immediately became emotionally involved with the characters and their lives during that time in American history.  The book was definitely a page turner for me.
B0066W1AZK|5|Very good app.  You can change the difficulty of your computer opponent.  The board is attractive and simple.  Each player is timed.  If you love Chess, go for it.  If you are a noob, go for it.  This is a great introduction to the game.
B00E32507O|1|I love the story but the book was supposed to be new. It had ballpoint pen marks on the back outside cover and the pages of the book looked like the book had water damage. I wanted it for a gift but there was no way I could give a book in this condition to someone as a gift so I kept it for myself.
B0007OY2P8|1|Received DVD  with second side unplayable, disk separation, very unhappy result. I now purchase my DVD's at another site, which was a ease and has great costumer support and much better prices. Amazon has become too bloated to check it's quality and have a responsive customer service. I love Jane Austen, have read and have all versions of videos of her work going back too BBC stuff from the seventies [my most favorite]. The newest version so to be released in 2008 Northanger Abby, sounds good. Amazon does not keep up with new releases or version of Austen, Dickens, Elliot, or James. Do yourself a favor though look to other DVD suppliers for your DVD's.  John S.
0151013047|3|The author did a good job of expressing divided loyalty and visceral identification with primary culture.  A country is like a family in creating the sense of self.  As a person who grew up in a culture different from my parents, I have a dual loyalty and understand the tension. <br /> <br />I am concerned about the ending.  It seemed too simple and heavy handed in contrast to the complexity of the rest of the book.  In a James Bond scene the author perpetuates the myth that Americans kill dissidents like countries without free elections, free speech or term limits do.  (Think KGB,radioactive beverages, and oatmeal faces.)  If  America killed those who speak against those in power, we would have no one left at the Washington Post, The New York Times, the LA Times, the Philadephia Inquirer, the Detroit Free Press, CBS, NBC or ABC etc etc.  Contrast that to what happened to Daniel Pearl in Pakistan.   I have  family member whose job it is to visit imprisoned journalists in Islamic and other States.  There are no imprisoned journalists in the US last time I checked with Amnesty and PEN.  In fact the NYT's is giving coordinates of Iranian dissidents.  So this ending seemed unreal and unfair. I closed the book very depressed, thinking terrorists will feel further justified and the author will be responsible for more death. <br /> <br />It also made me think about the basis of racism being competetion for survival of the tribe, not only for cultural survival but survival of the ego and the genes, ie; sexual competetion.  Although love and marriage occurs often between races, when a culture feels threatened like the US or Muslim States now, the wagons circle and individuals are seen through the filter of race, not individual personalites.  (Even though you may like everyone more than your obnoxious loser brother and would never marry anyone like him, you will defend him with your life if he is threatened.)  <br />

B007VDN1PA|1|Bought this unit in hopes of scanning many older negatives and making fresh prints.  I used to own and operate a one hour photo lab so I know color and processing.  The negative holder was quick to permanently scratch many of my old negatives,  each negative that was scanned seemed to have a &#34;hot spot&#34; in the middle which covered just about all of the center of the image.  The quality of the prints that did get made were grainy - even after digital post processing.  Then the unit quit scanning the negatives, kept getting a &#34;locked sandisk&#34; image on the unit.  While trying to get it to scan the images the unit somehow dumped about 350 images on the disc.  Now I can't get it to scan at all and I've had the product less than five months.<br /><br />It appears that others have had better luck with this product than I did from their reviews.  I had high hopes for this product but when it ruins your negatives, dumps images you do have stored then quits working altogether I just can't give it anymore than a one star rating.
B00881VLCE|5|I have really enjoyed these puzzles and think this is a very good site.
B002RSDW80|3|Meryl Streep did very well in her role as Julia Child. She was a dead ringer, for sure. If only this movie could've been made as a biopic for Julia Child only. I would've enjoyed that very much, and it would've been a far more interesting movie.       Quite frankly, I could've done without seeing the antics of the Julie Powell, whiny chica who was attempting to ride Ms. Childs's coattails. At first, when watching the movie, I couldn't understand why Julia Child disregarded her. Then I finally read Julie's book and viewed her blog, so now I completely understood why Julia Child blew off Julie and her insipid blog and cooking \\"stunt.\\"  Anyone who read Julia Childs's book knows that Julia's life was far more interesting. She was no victim of circumstances. She had gumption, vision, she took the bull by the horns and when she was disappointed in something or when things didn't go her way, she didn't go falling on the floor in a meltdown like Julie did. I wanted to smack the Julie character when I saw that!    Amy Adams did the best she could with the material she was given. I don't fault her for having to play the emotionally immature Julie Powell. The screenwriter does deserve some credit for actually making that 'sow's ear' into a reasonable fascimile of a silk purse. Those who plowed through Powell's whiny tome will know exactly of what I speak.    I thought Stanley Tucci did an excellent job portraying Paul Child, Julia's husband. As for those complaining about the politics in the movie and the way it was portrayed, I think that is an unfair thing. It's good to see a movie that does deal with the way McCarthyism impacted the lives of regular people, not just celebrities.     Still, despite its flaws, I think the movie is worth watching, as long as you don't expect too much.
B003G4W49C|4|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author puts the story together in a way that you feel for the hero and hope he comes out of his task unharmed.  Very creative and enjoyable.
1563894696|3|To compare this with Batman year one is an insult to Batman year one. The ridiculous parade of batman foes, all of them just crammed into the story to satisfy brainless fans, is dissapointing. Not a single one of them is of real importance to the plot. You can really forget about them. And the captions in every single issue, telling you who is who, you can really see how the Long Halloween was more of a marketing excersise than anything else.<br />Now, that aside, the art is great, as the ending, and also the transformation of Harvey Dent. This is a good comic book, but by no means a great one. If Loeb had only worked with the crime families this would have been a much better story.<br />Do not believe the hype. Read at leas the first part before you buy this, decide then.
B0074VTHKM|4|The story begins with an &#34;accused&#34;, but he turns out not to be &#34;The Accused&#34;.  While it was a nifty twist, leaving that part of the story undeveloped was disappointing.

B000E6UK5K|4|David Gilmour really deserves credit for his \\"On An Island\\" album, released today.  The man clearly doesn't give a damn about following any trends, and I say more power to him.  The album does indeed sound very Floyd-ish, which Gilmour himself admits, but it's not merely some toothless rehash of past glories, and the production values here are really excellent (the album was produced by Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, and Chris Thomas).  And Gilmour's in excellent voice too, sounding as though he's barely aged a day in the past 20 years.  You needn't have any worries about this being a \\"modernized\\", high-tech disaster--the album sounds more like something that was recorded in 1980 than in the 2000s, and I really mean that as a compliment.      I think it's off the mark and misleading to bluntly say that Gilmour has \\"gone adult contemporary\\" with this album--that might get certain people thinking he's chosen a bland synthesizer-heavy approach.  Quite the contrary, synthesizer is only used for a light sprinkling of effects on the title track, and synths are nowhere to be heard on songs such as \\"The Blue\\" and \\"Where We Start\\"--instead, David favors real piano, real electric piano, and especially real Hammond organ (which all three of these have), and that plays a huge role in them sounding so wonderfully organic.      Yes, this is a VERY low volume album, but for the most part, it's very appealing, not just thanks to the production, but also because the songwriting is generally at a really high level.  Frankly, I think you could throw the same kind of praise at much of the Floyd's work--\\"Wish You Were Here\\", great album as it is, never rocks very hard at all.    Most of the lyrics here were written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson, and although they occasionally lean towards the sickly-sweet end of things, as on \\"Smile\\", they're hardly as embarassing as some of the reviewers make them out to be.  And ultimately, Gilmour makes up for it with the music.  The title track is sumptuous--it sounds kind of like an acoustic modification of Floyd's \\"Breathe\\", featuring superb guitar work, live orchestration, and vocal harmonies from Crosby & Nash that really take the song to the next level (Richard Wright plays the Hammond on this track as well).  The super-mellow \\"The Blue\\" has a wonderfully serene, blissful feel to it, with gentle harmonica and a remarkably effective back-and-forth piano line, and Gilmour's extended soloing, even if he overdoes those swooping sounds a bit, is still really really nice, with extremely impressive tone.  The relatively short instrumental \\"Red Sky At Night\\" is an intriguing change of pace, with Gilmour switching over to saxophone, and to excellent effect--he brings the same kind of unique feeling to his sax soloing as he does to his emotional guitar leads.  \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" is also a really fine ballad, with Gilmour's vocal making the most of the wonderful lilting melodicism on the verses.  \\"This Heaven\\" adds a welcome diversity to the proceedings, shuffling along nicely and containing a nice bluesy acoustic riff.  \\"Smile\\", like I said, is kind of on the sugary side, but the acoustic slide guitar work, Gilmour's somewhat jazz-tinged lead vocal, and the sheer tunefulness give it much appeal.     Gilmour's previous solo album, 1984's \\"About Face\\", ends with the song \\"Near The End\\", and he ends \\"On An Island\\" with \\"Where We Start\\" which seems like a sequel to the former song.  \\"Where We Start\\" is the one non-instrumental track on the album that Gilmour wrote entirely himself.  Yes, the lyrics leave a little to be desired, but the song has an undeniably soothing and reflective feel, somewhat melancholy and yet with hope for what's still to come, a trademark Gilmour touch.  It makes for a highly fitting finale to the album.    As for the few remaining tracks...  \\"Castellorizon\\", the obligatory album-opening instrumental, starts off as a sound collage before Gilmour starts wailing away backed by a full orchestra--it's certainly more enjoyable than the somewhat similar \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" from his \\"About Face\\" album, but it's still pretty forgettable.  Likewise, the instrumental \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" is okayish, but pretty dull.  The one track that particularly sticks out like a sore thumb and that you're better off skipping happens to be the album's hardest-rocking song--\\"Take A Breath\\" has annoying, repetitive spoken chanting, plus it's sorely lacking in terms of melody and catchiness; it considerably hurts the overall flow of the album, and it suggests that Gilmour isn't sure how to rock out effectively anymore, making it easy to see why the album is so ballad-heavy.    All in all, I can't see anyone who loves '72-'75-era Floyd or Gilmour's previous solo work not taking a strong liking to \\"On An Island\\".  I'm well aware that this album is taking quite a beating from a lot of so-called professional critics, and I can't help but suspect it's partly because of the album's mellow tone and a lack of patience on their part to really *listen*.  Maybe some folks were hoping Gilmour would push the envelope more, and I'll admit I do understand the feeling that if an artist just cranks out an album that sounds like a copy of earlier work, there's no point to it.  That said, this is an album for diehard David Gilmour/ mid-'70s Floyd fans who have listened to those records religiously and want something familiar, yet new, and for an artist of Gilmour's age and stature, it's understandable that he'd put out a record to fit that bill, and the fact that the result sounds this fresh and effective, it not only justifies the exercise, it actually provides an additional demonstration of just how deep Gilmour's talent is.  It also underlines that this is clearly the album he wanted to make, and I give him a lot of credit for following his instincts.    (P.S.  My copy of \\"On An Island\\" includes a bonus disc featuring the laidback bluesy instrumental \\"Island Jam\\"--it's a nice little bonus.On the downside, the book-style packaging of the album is marred by the vulnerable foam rubber piece that's meant to hold the CD--you may very well end up needing a separate case to hold the disc itself.)
B008XG1X18|3|I love this app, when it works right.  Half the time it won't open and it has to be force closed, then re-opened. Other times pictures won't load or it freezes.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this app. If you wait too long to cross the road or street, then a eagle comes and gets you. There are also characters to unlock and choose to play as. This app is really fun and cool.
B00JVZ0DQG|2|This is a fun and cute game for newbies.  Wonderful graphics, cute characters & fun chores.  I do, however, wish that I got the same advantages as those who are on Facebook.  I do not have or want a Facebook account.  I also wish they had a way to ask questions.  For example, I have opened the ability to purchase a dog house and I have the money and land, but every time I try to move it, I don't get the green checkmark.  Otherwise it is a great, addicting game.  9/11/2014 Update:  After playing this game for several weeks, I am not as big a fan as I was when I first got it. I dropped the rating to 2 stars. There are &#34;issues&#34; that the company says they are working on but they never seem to be fixed.  Or, they say they are fixed and a problem pops up somewhere else.  They also don't respond to &#34;bug&#34; reports.  It's very frustrating because it is a fun game to play when there aren't problems.  But everyday there is at least one (and sometimes more than one) problem.  7/2/2016:  I stopped playing this game for several months.  When I decided to try it again, I found that more and more farm land had been taken over by the special events.  The land over by the airport and the land just before the &#34;woods&#34; on the other side of the road are both open.  There is no reason why the land on the airport side couldn't be used for the event and the vacant land on the farm side used for...well, farming.  This game is getting increasingly frustrating to the point that I will probably delete it totally from my Kindle.

B001NEK2GE|1|I got this to replace my aging N52TE gamepad. I started off with the original N52 when Belkin made it, moved to the TE when Razer bought it, and now that my TE's dying I hoped this'd be an upgrade. My opinion is it's a huge waste of money.<br /><br />To explain, let's go point by point. The gamepad itself is easily twice the size of the N52. I mean that literally, it's huge and heavy. Heavy's good, it keeps it from moving around during use but the fact is it's massive. To use it I have to turn my keyboard sideways and slide it back on my desk to make room. I don't have a small desk either, nor do I have small hands. Point 2, it has a huge number of buttons. I thought this'd be a good thing, I always wanted another couple on the Nostromo plus the Nostromo lacks an analog joystick. This has a joystick and it works great....but it's tiny and way too sensitive. The buttons on the G13 are tiny and numerous, meaning to use them you need to have super long fingers the size of knitting needles. The N52 keys are normal keyboard sized, so while they aren't huge, they're not a problem either. Also, to use all the N52's keys you just need to move your fingers. The G13 is so huge and the keys angled so badly you can't use the handrest because your hand's doing the time warp all over the thing's keyboard. I can use the N52 for hours at a time. Literally, I played through all of MW3's campaign in one sitting (Breaks for lunch and dinner) when the game came out with no hand or wrist strain. The G13 on the other hand, I had to stop using after 20 minutes because my whole forearm hurt. Lastly the software. It can do basic keymapping only. Volume controls? Nope. Mouse buttons (Wheel up/down/middle) nope. Other media or non key controls? Nope. A save icon so you can save your keymaps after modifying them? Nope, gotta click this little totally unlabeled icon in the lower left corner. The N52 software may be ugly and a kludge, but it's 10 times more capable. Top all that off with zero documentation and the quick start manual has no words. None, it's 4 pictures and there's no directions on keymapping, what all the non-game buttons do, or how to use any of it.<br /><br />I'll freely admit the G13 is built well. Tough, I love the variable lighting, the handrest is well built, but only if you're just resting your hand on it. The software is, I'll admit, easy to use for basic keymapping and making a new keymap for a new game is easy as pie. Modifying it's easy also, at least until you try to safe the modifications. The thing looks good, has some admittedly really cool capabilities with the built-in LCD, like a clock, system monitor that displays CPU and RAM use, RSS feeds (Though good luck getting one you actually want, the interface for adding one's useless) timer, and media display (Not controls, just track name and so on)<br /><br />Do I regret this purchase? Yep, bigtime. I'd been hoping to unify all my inputs (Mouse, keyboard, gamepad) under one bit of software (Logitech) since right now I'm running 3 different kinds (Logitech, Razer, Saitek) and this hunk of junk voids that plan. Would I recommend this thing to others? Unless you've got spider fingers and don't need advanced features then no, I wouldn't. Yeah the Nostromo has some glaring flaws (The D-Pad most people use for movement is 4 directions only, it's so light it skids around a bit, the software's overly complicated) but do yourself a favor and get one of those.

1412960991|5|As a doctoral student, I purchased this book when a research professor at my university recommended it. I can see why! Since I am considering using the case study process for my dissertation research, this book helped me visualize how it might work. Yin filled the book with cogent examples from many fields, with references to find the original study. These examples were both relatively current and from decades past; this range of times helped me see the growth in the case study process and its breadth of applicability.     The book is not a follow-the-numbers process by any means, no cookie-cutter here. Instead, it contains a structured process from beginning to end, including analysis and reporting. Along the way, Yin forces the reader to ask questions and consider the applicability of the case study approach to one's own work.     All in all, very helpful and no doubt, it will be a reference for me in years to come.

6304595247|5|Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fienne's preformances are, to say the least, perhaps the most brilliant bit of acting I've yet seen. I had cried at, perhaps, let's say a total of three movies before watching this one night  on BRAVO - and never at a man's preformance. Ralph Fiennes produces a  gut-wrenching preformance as Heathcliff - hard, cruel, and yet a bit more  human than the author protrayed him in the book. Juliet Binoche adds light  to all her dark, dank scenes - and the film is mostly dark and dank - and  gives the added beauty to the cast. The casting of beautiful - startingly -  Sinead O'Conner as the author was plain genious, as the forlorn and yet  dazzling look of Bronte mirrors perfectly that of a perfectly costumed  O'Conner.<br />This would still be my favorite movie if it had ended badly -  with Heathcliff dying, kaput, THE END. Sadly, many tradegy/dramas like this  end up ending miserably and leaving the viewer with the feeling of  &quot;What a perfectly good waste of film&quot;. No one wants to watch a  beautifully shot and acted film based on a heart-wrenching novel like that.  No matter HOW beautiful. Thankfully, you don't have to. You're left with a  sense of &quot;Wow&quot; instead of &quot;Well, now I'm off to buy more  Kleenex&quot;. First rule of a critique: never gush. Well, to heck with it  all - this is the best darned movie you're ever going to watch, in this  lifetime or the next. Take my word for it.
0064407667|5|There are very few people who have the gift of writing that Lemony Snicket has. He is the only writer I have ever read with his strange humor and ability to incorperate vocabulary lessons into a story that fit perfectly; he uses the now famous \\"which here means...\\" technique. This is his first book in the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" series, and it may be one of his finest. It tells the misadventures of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire, who become orphans within the first few pages of the books (and whose names are not without a purpose; one who enjoys a little political humor may want to look into them). The story is ridden with carefully represented woe that saves the reader from pitying the orphans and instead has him or her cheering alongside them, which can prove embarassing if the book is being read in a public setting. The adventures are not too outrageous, indeed, the solutions to the problems prove Mr. Snicket to be a clever chap, but if you read book one, you will certainly continue on to book two.  <br />So be forewarned: He has the knack of continuing a story without making it seem cumbersome, but as the books add up, so does the stress and unyeilding desire to buy the next book. If one cannot handle this book, DO NOT continue the series; the trouble gets much, much worse, to say the least. Even I am getting a queasy feeling inside me as I search for an available copy of the Slippery Slope.

B000GFLAI0|2|Very nice of Amazon to make this album available for free on its web site, but once I set it up with Windows Media I immediately became very disappointed.  The songs fade in so quickly and seemingly right in the middle of a line, then, after thirty seconds or so, fade out just as quickly--often just as Dylan is about to resolve a thought or give a punchline.   <br /> <br />The problem starts with the opening number, the promising \\"Thunder on the Mountain,\\" whose cryptic lyrics, \\"You brought me here and now you're running me away/The writing on the wall...\\" left me confused and unsatisfied.  Same goes for \\"Rollin' and Tumblin',\\" a rollicking number that, just when you get into the rhythm, fades out and leaves you hanging.  By the end I was left feeling so completely baffled and unsatisfied that I vowed never to listen to the album again.  Maybe this is some kind of new approach to musicmaking that I'm just too old to appreciate, but I prefer songs that start with an intro and end with some kind of resolution.  Dylan is a living legend and should give himself more than thirty seconds to develop a theme.

B00000255X|5|I've always been a fan of Dylan's long form songs--\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", \\"Desolation Row\\", \\"Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\" and \\"Jack of Hearts\\", among others.  \\"Desire\\", released directly after \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" has three such opuses, and I've loved 'em all for 30 years.  The band that played at my wedding reception in 1991 played \\"Hurricane\\", the story of prizefighter Ruben Carter's arrest for a murder he may not have committed.  \\"Isis\\", a fantastical and allegorical tale of a treasure hunter, may not quite measure up to opus status by way of length, but the twists and turns taken by Dylan's story are always captivating--along with the great images and rhymes, my favorite being \\"the wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous/we chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn/when he died I hoped that it wasn't contagious/but I made up my mind that I had to go on.\\"  The third of the trio, \\"Joey\\", is certainly an opus--both lyrically and musically with its evocative accordion and violin accompaniment, along with Emmylou Harris's harmonies.  \\"One day they blew him down/in a clam bar in New York/he could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork/he pushed the table over to protect his family/then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.\\"  Maybe Bob is borrowing from The Godfather here, but it's still a vivid and arresting image to me.  Others in here have dismissed \\"Mozambique\\" as a lightweight song, but its catchy melody provides a good counterpoint to life on the ground in that country, which I don't think is near as idyllic as Bob describes.  The remaining songs \\"Black Diamond Bay\\", \\"Cup of Coffee\\", \\"Durango\\" and \\"Sara\\" are all good--they just don't grab me like three of my favorite Dylan story songs do.

B000BB1MHS|5|This isn't really a remake. Willa Wonka and The Chocoalte Factory....that's the one with Gene Wilder..and it was loosely based on the book entitled: \\"Charlie and the Chocoalte Factory.\\" Yes that's right..it was a book first. The movie \\"Charile and The Chocoalte Factory\\" is actually a movie version of the book...with a few things added or altred. In the book there were actually flashbacks to Wonka's childhood just like there are in the movie. Though the book never really talked about his father. There was only one line in the book about his father. Having said this....this movie is excelnt I loved it for two main reasons ...one: Tim Burton directed it...I love Tim Burton. And two...Johnny Depp was in it..Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. I also loved well...everything else about it. If you haven't seen this movie yet I suggest you watch it. You don't have to buy it...but just at least watch it..and then make up your mind about what you think of it. For me it was just a delightful adventure through a chocoalte factory. And another chance to experaince Tim Burton's vision of something I had loved before. Johnny Depp's acting was amazing in this movie..he had me laughing all the way through. Some things might have been fore seeabile...but I laughed at them all the same. I turlly think you'll enjoy this movie...espically if you enjoyed \\"Willa Wonka and the Chocoalte Factory.\\"
B005FITIK0|4|Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody reteam (following the widely successful \\"Juno\\" of a few years ago) to bring us another \\"slice of life\\" movie.<br /><br />\\"Young Adult\\" brings the story of a mid/late 30s woman (played brilliantly by Charlize Theron) who seemingly never grew up (hence still \\"young adult\\") and feels and acts as if it's still high school. Her job (writing \\"young adult\\" books) is going nowhere either and for no good reason she decides to go back from Minneapolis to her hometown (fictional Mercury, Minnesota) to win back the love of her HS boyfriend who is now a happily married man with a baby. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Reitman and Cody do a great job bringing this intensely unlikable character in full nuance. But hats off to Charlize Theron who really outshines everyone in bringing this troubles character in a way that makes it believable and not a caricature. No, this is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" movie in the way \\"Juno\\" could be viewed, but \\"Young Adult\\" is very much a worthwhile movie nevertheless, and by all means Theron should pick up an Oscar nomination for her performance.
B00ENYKBD0|5|Russel Crowe is an amazing actor. He allows you to go inside the mind of people with mental issues and sense their side of the story, what they feel and what they see.  The hard realization that the rest of us can not understand their thoughts, and the isolation in which they live.<br />Plus, this is a real story. That also give us the opportunity to realize the challenges and difficulties of other people lives.
B0082RHRHC|5|I have seen the movie but I had never read the book. I am so glad I did.
B007OWRBJK|5|Very quick page-turner. Easy to read and interesting. It made me want to get back into Tommy and listen and watch live clips with a whole new understanding of the man behind its creation. Pete is obviously quite a complex man and I ended up feeling connected to him and sorry for him at the same time. Quite a life he has had, to say the least. It's a must read for any fan.
B008YAPRPG|5|Thx
B004GHNIRK|5|My favorite secular work, the story is heart breaking while lifting up the soul to new heights.<br />This version cuts some of Hugo's lengthy exposition that is not directly story related. Those parts are good and help the reader<br />better understand the time period, but can be hard to read since they sometimes come in the middle of great parts without<br />progressing the story.  Start with this version, read the unabridged later.
B0017KIBAI|5|Best controller of all time!
B00004SCX6|2|I gave this album two stars because it contains two good songs-- the title track, and the Rolling Stones remake. The rest of it is very forgettable at best. Britney's last album lacked strong vocals, but at least it had a high  percentage of rather catchy tunes that went over well despite her lack of  vocal prowess. The songs on &quot;Oops&quot; are bland at best, and the  annoying dialogue between songs is enough to destroy any hint of artistic  merit lurking somewhere on this album.
B008NCSZQ8|5|Great script-well directed cast.  Perfect Summer Blockbuster: humor, action, chemistry, and great special effects.  If you like the work of Joss Whedon, Robert Downey, Jr or Sam Jackson, you will love it.
B00514HDNW|5|This book is - in my opinion - second only to Dracula when it comes to a great vampire tale. If you're a fan of horror, vampires, or even zombies, this book is a must-read. It delivers in every possible way. And please, if you've seen the movie, please don't think that is representative of the book. It's truly not.<br /><br />This is also the book that (love 'em or hate 'em) gave us the modern interpretation of zombies. It was this book that inspired Romero to write Night of the Living Dead, which changed the face of the zombie forever.<br /><br />Read this book. At the very least, it's the second best vampire tale ever written... and there's merit to the assertion that it's the best.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is perfect for all horse lovers everywhere. The graphics are amazing and the physics are great for this kind of app. Love it!!!!
B0053O89Z6|5|Not as good as the firsts seasons. Better than the sixth. Maybe less funny but I can't stop following these new friends.
B0009KA7BS|4|Of course purists will always cry foul at the \\"messes\\", \\"disasters\\" and \\"heresies\\" Hollywood performs on their little \\"possesions\\". Since I did not carry this burden, I was able to enjoy Constantine on its own, no preconceptions or rules. This movie rocks, plain and simple, and all of the ignoramus who insist on the \\"adaptation\\" label will surely fail to judge it on its own right.  I am not a comic book fan, and I did not read any of the \\"HELLBALZER\\" (as a so-called fan of the comic books mistakenly typed, TWICE). I enjoyed \\"Constantine\\". And as for those who also did, kudos. Don't let the comic book crowd make you feel any less. After all, their limitations and views are theirs alone to suffer...
0345350499|5|Marion Zimmer Bradley shifts the focus of the greatest British legend, the tale of King Arthur, from the Christian male perspective, to that of the powerful, old religion led by women and centered in the Holy Isle of Avalon.<br />Morgan le Fay, or Morgaine, is a warm, enchanting and above all real, woman.  She struggles with her dual role as wise-woman, powerful priestess and sister, mother, lover and wife in a growing Christian society.  Having nothing against the Christ, only &quot;his priests&quot; who trample on the traditions and beliefs of the Old Religion, Morgaine battles to find her place in the center of the worlds at war.<br />Morgaine's brother, King Arthur, has struggles of his own, but it is through the eyes of the women in his life that the true undercurrent of power can be felt.  Gwenhwyfar, his sorrowfully barren wife, plays her own role in the fate of Britain.  As do Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, Igraine, mother to both Morgaine and Arthur, and the wicked Morgause, sister to Viviane and Igraine and perhaps the most intrinsically evil character in the story.<br />This story takes place in a time long gone, but definitely not forgotten.  Through Morgaine, Viviane, and the other women of the Mists of Avalon, the Legend of Arthur and Camelot is now open to the hearts and souls of powerful, hopeful women for all eternity.
B004TI5N38|4|I have loved Baldacci sense his 1st book absolute power.  This one drew me in right away. At times when anyone writes military or government books as he does they are too difficult for me to understand. Not zero day.  I liked Puller and even though he is a kick ___ soldier he has a heart and compassion  the action is great the thinking methodical with sideline views with his poor brother, father and feelings for Sam Cole.  Great read!  I hope there are more books to make it a series.  Let Robert out of prison!  I am sure he is innocent.
B00DR0PDNE|1|chromecast did not work with kindle fire .before i purchased it i looked for info on this and found non and it does not always work with ipod its kind of a piece of s***. but thanks for asking

B000002VSN|5|some of her greatest work miss you
0575064080|5|I had heard Mr Prachett was a humorous writer- but I somehow expected it to be along the lines of Douglas Adams- who I enjoyed to a point but the humor wore thin after a while- like hearing a class clown day after day after day... But, I truly loved Mr Prachett's writing. It was funny but never lost sight of characters. I laughed out loud quite a few times- but they were not laughs that carried me out of the story.<br /><br />Where Adams always seems to be mocking his characters and seemingly ambivalent about killing them off, Prachett seems to truly care about his characters -large and small. One can easily see how a world exists around these folks and it is not hard to imagine wandering away from the storyline and having adventures of your own. The plot was great- not particularly predictable. I was not sure how it was all going to turn out -and was nicely surprised with the way he wrapped it up. I look forward to exploring more of his work. I highly recommend it to anyone with an imagination and an appreciation for an amusing storyteller with a great deal of heart.
B00BD99JMW|3|Why?! ... I think that was unexpected & crazy but I guess it's your book end it your way. :(

B000092ZYX|4|As a Radiohead addict, I downloaded this cd several weeks before it came out, but I also got up at 4 in the morning on June 10th to buy the cd. Its well worth it and a great addition to the Radiohead collection, but its not as electronic-driven as Kid A or OK Computer (which I recommend to anyone just getting in to Radiohead). While it is better than Amnesiac (what wasn't) or Pablo Honey, Its not another legend in the making. One quick comparison: (and not just because theyre Brits), but Radiohead's sucess is much like that of the Beatles. They peaked, and they continue to put out good stuff, but they'll never measure past their greatest accomplishment (Kid A, or the Beatle's Sgt.Pepper's), but everything is still smooth sailing.
B00DUGCLY4|4|it is easy but gets harder as you go over all it is a great app I would recommend it to every one
B0002SROSQ|5|On this double CD album the Bad Seeds make a huge leap. Nick Cave is fully in his own voice now, fully in control, confident and he's finally arrived at those monstorous themes that he's wrestled with since, well, forever. I think his artistic maturity fully matches his ambition now, and the results are beautiful.    <br /> <br />In fact, a major theme of the album is the struggle to find your muse, and more importantly, what you do with the damn thing once you've caged it. T <br /> <br />It's as brilliant a singer songwriter album as anything released in the past forty years.  <br /> <br />
B003ZMF26W|5|This is a great mouse. The software is easy to use and makes the mouse highly customizable. I couldn't even figure out what to do with all possibilities. All around, a great mouse. Only one problem, however. The laser stopped working about 4 months after I got it, rendering it useless. If it hadn't broken, this would be five stars.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Cooler Master replaced my mouse and it is now on its way back to me. I am very satisfied, and have thus changed my rating to 5 stars as this mouse deserves.

B00004U8JV|5|Jurassic Park left me in awe at how CGI could make these creatures, that I have loved since I was two, come to life with such realism! I was hoping for a sequel. <BR>Fortunately, four years later I got that sequel in the form of this movie. <BR>I felt the dinosaur action was more plentiful in this one than the previous installment and we get to see some newer faces in the dinosaur community. <BR>The acting is pretty good but seems to get a little off key here and there. <BR>Overall, I thought it was slightly superior than its predecessor and is one of the best dinosaur films out there!
B000YGIIPO|5|Pratchett's books are never offensive and always entertaining, even when intended for kids. Why do I have to write 7more words?
B008AK8FHM|5|Given what I already know about God and Heaven this book just fortified it. If you have questions about who you are and where you come from this book can help you find those answers.  I highly recommend it and a companion book - The Book Of Mormon Another Testament Of Jesus Christ.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|This game is too addictive, I have not been able to do too much else.  I do enjoy the graphics and th gameplay!!!
B003YFIUW8|4|This book is very cleverly written about an intense situation from the perspective of a five year old. I was intrigued by the story and moved by the main characters. I would definitely recommend it!
B00LTMIAF0|5|Great score like everything else about the film-artful and original.
B00000J6AG|5|I think it is one of the best CDs I've ever got. It is unique, alive, real, simple, both tough and sensitive. It is amazing that all 18 songs are that good. You do not have to be just rock, jazz, funk, or whatever to  listen to it.  It is an experience somebody has to live ... It is primitive  rythm!

1400079179|3|I suppose everything has its fashions, from clothing to cars to literature.  The Da Vinci Code seems to be one such literary fashion.<br /><br />I will concede that Dan Brown is a good writer.  He knows how to tell a story and to tell it in an exciting, quick manner which makes it hard to put a book down.<br /><br />My objection though to the Da Vinci Code is not so much the story but rather the inflated claims Brown makes.<br /><br />Brown has claimed numerous times all of the material in his books is 'fact.'  These facts range from certain assertions about conspiracies involving countless secret societies in the Catholic Church (ranging from Opus Dei to the Knights Templar) to secret grails to Jesus being married to Mary Magdalane and ideas about a secret 'bloodline' which is the royal heritage of Jesus and Mary and wait for it, involves French Kings and other nobility.  Tacked on to this is the notion Da Vinci's paintings contain secret messages hidden from all but a few, and Harvard Professors of Symbology (a post which in fact does not exist).<br /><br />The truth is, Dan Brown has borrowed many of his ideas from other sources, which upon critical examination are showed to be somewhat dubious.  There are many books which explode the 'facts' Dan Brown uses (and good scholars like Bart Ehrman are generous enough to point out what Brown gets right as well as wrong) and they are too long to mention, but suffice to say it is better to try and enjoy this book for what it is; a good 'airport' novel you can read in a few hours, rather than a ground-breaking revelation about the true nature of Christianity, Opus Dei, Jesus and Mary Magdalene, the Louvre in Paris, and God knows what else.

B0020BUWX2|4|Honestly it was amazing in the most terrible thing. It'll leave you guessing and angry. I was angry at parts. And then the ending was unclear of what really happened. But to bring out those feelings from the reader, that's how you know it was an amazing book :)
B008D30K7E|5|Just love it. It take my mind from everyday problems and give me nice relaxing time. So many historic events and so many countries in one story just made it great even with most of it being fiction mixed with real stuff. Great book.

0307352145|5|This was recommended on another website as a validating book for introverts and it really was for me.  I hesitate to use the word &#34;life changing,&#34; but it was so refreshing to know so many famous, intelligent, creative people as well as ordinary men and women like me, consider themselves introverts--proud introverts at that!  I kept underlining passages for those times when I'm down on myself for being described by my friends and co-workers as a &#34;wall flower&#34; and &#34;too quiet.&#34;

B000F4LPJ6|5|Before Hunger games you had Battle Royale. Serious tones in a &#34;what if&#34; scenario about how adults putting kids against each other to kill one another in order to &#34;act more adult&#34; and be better, progressive, responsible, contributing people in society backed by a government sanctioned program. Friends are put against one another, as well as some wild cards, to fight for survival with randomly given weapons.

006232912X|5|In place of an epigraph, the novel has a little teaser:<br /><br />&#34;The statistical probability that an illiterate in 1970s Soweto will grow up and one day find herself confined in a potato truck with the Swedish King and prime minister is 1 in 45,766,212,810. [This, according to the calculations of the aforementioned illiterate herself.]&#34;<br /><br />The said illiterate and protagonist of the book is a black girl named Nombeko, 14 when we first meet her. For the past nine years, she has been an employee of the City of Johannesburg Sanitation Department as a latrine emptier, but things are about to change for her. For one thing, she has a genius for calculations, and once given a chance to get rid of that illiteracy, she will reveal a genius for most other things as well. Indeed, she is a thousand times smarter the head of the South African nuclear weapons program, an alcoholic appointed through nepotism for whom she finds herself working as an indentured employee. Until the weapons program is ended, and she finds herself in virtual possession of a working atomic bomb that never got entered in the official registry….<br /><br />Alternate chapters take us to Sweden, where a fanatical republican brings up his twin sons, both called Holger (don't ask!), to carry on his mission to destroy the monarchy. He dies, and Holger One follows in his father's footsteps while Holger Two, saner and smarter, has other ideas. Roughly a third of the way into the book, the two stories will connect, and after the passage of several decades and many, many, many twists and turns, they will culminate in the back of that potato truck with the King of Sweden.<br /><br />This is not really my thing at all; I prefer a bit more reality in my novels. But I enjoyed it for several reasons. First, Nombeko is such an attractive heroine, and there is always pleasure in seeing the underdog use her wits to get the better of those who have all the advantages. Second, Jonasson (as translated by Rachel Willson-Broyles) has a most engaging style, seldom laugh-aloud funny, but always amusing. Thirdly, his plotting is so darned good. Unlike many tall tales, it is not simply a matter of tacking on one episode after another like a weekly serial. There is clearly an intricate geometer at work here, introducing vectors on page 80 or 100 that will not click into place until page 300 or 320.<br /><br />And finally, the novel is not so disconnected from reality after all. Although the doings of the main characters are improbable, they are shown against an international background that is essentially factual. The oppression in 1970s South Africa is real, as is the end of Apartheid. Events in Sweden are probably less well known to outsiders, but as far as I can see, these are real too, and the book gets in some sly questions about its political self-image. And on the world stage, its viewpoint extends to Israel, Russia, America, and the increasing role of China in Africa. The action of this political satire may be whimsical, but its world-view is as clear eyed as they come.chel Willson-Broyles) has a most engaging style, seldom laugh-aloud funny, but always amusing.

0061714402|5|Dave Mustaine founder, guitarist and front man for the heavy metal band, Megadeth, typically generate a variety of emotions resulting from his stage banter, interviews and music.  Megadeth fans will instantly give the horns sign with one or both hands as they exhibit their sweet air guitar skills.<br /><br />Others who might be fans of a competing bands like, say, Mustaine's first band, Metallica, are likely to pontificate about the finer points of guitar skills between Mustaine and Metallica's Kirk Hammett.  And, still others who are aware of Mustaine's conversion to Christianity are keenly interested in the strength or weakness of his walk of faith.<br /><br />As an avid student of celebrities and personalities as well as a Christian, I was eager to dig into the newly released paperback edition of Dave's autobiography, Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir.  I'll be honest: I wasn't expecting much from the book because, well, I've never read a head banger's autobiography before and really thought I was going to be bored out of my aging mind.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />The book is very heavy in personal introspection and transparency.  The reader will learn very quickly what make Mustaine tick and what ticks him off.  Megadeth and Metallica fans will read lots of inside scoop on the history of both bands and lots of stories behind the songs.  Dave also shares a lot of the interpersonal dynamics between him and the various configurations of his heavy metal enterprise.<br /><br />Christians who pick up the book expecting to read something along the lines of B.J. Thomas's Home Where I Belong will be shocked.  The language in the book is raw.  Very raw.  And, while I'm not one who uses the same kind of language as Mustaine chooses to use, I found his transparency and his simple, level-headed approach to his faith actually quite refreshing.<br /><br />For those of you who run, not walk, from all things Christian, don't be such a wuss.  Mustaine's book isn't \\"churchy\\".  Actually, it's far from it.  He states his faith in a matter-of-fact manner and doesn't try to jam anything down the reader's throat.  He just puts himself out there as he is and you can take him or leave him.  Either way, he's just going to keep on doing what he's doing while devoting more time to his family.<br /><br />The reader will get the very clear impression from Dave that  he knows he's lucky to still be playing guitar after going through his debilitating affliction with his money-making left hand.  He also comes across as one who knows darn well that he shouldn't be alive and is living life as one who is fully enjoying his umpteenth chance at living life to its healthy fullest.<br /><br />If you love reading about talented people - especially those who love a great rags to riches story, you're gonna love Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir.  While you're ordering your copy, why not go ahead and get some Christmas shopping done for that head-banger friend or relative by picking up an extra copy or two?

B000W1YYRC|5|Bands with such profound genius are rarely experienced twice in a lifetime. Sigur Ros have simply altered what we believed to be possible in the world of music.    From the moment the drama begins with the \\"guitar-plugging-in\\" sound until you notice it again seemingly turning off the the album, you journey from the most dreamish landscapes to the coldest and richest atmospheres and back. Although there is a reduction in the amount of instrumental layers involved (when compared to their other works), () offers an intensity, magnitude, and pure epicness that is unmmatched. A subtle hope is established as the backdrop of the first half until it transitions into a darker more contemplative state during the second, all to leave you seemingly physically exhausted from the massive and infinitely epic conclusion of #8.     If you want to experience new depths of life and music, () is an album to lead you on a journey.

B009G78EE2|4|I like that this artist is genuine and fresh, these days everyone copies each other to the point that it is rare to hear an origonal sound.
B00B2V66VS|3|The graphics are really nice but after a few seconds it becomes virtually impossible to keep up with plus even when I swipe the guy falls off anyway, I guess the developers need to fix that one but I do like it.  I always laugh when the guy falls off and you hear his yell.

B009GX7IRA|5|Even after 10 years, the story lines are still interesting and entertaining, and the characters still seem to work well together.
B00IUBM8PQ|4|Much the same great cast and production values.  The first movie was self contained and concluded nicely.  Not having read the books, I am guessing this served mostly to advance the theme of the series.
B000FBJAOG|5|this book is worth every cent, it explains everything you need to know about zombies from their anatomy to recorded attacks. It explains various weapons that are bad and good for killing zombies, how to rebuild after an apocalypse and even the stages in time after getting bit by a zombie until your transformation into the ranks of the undead. This is probably my favorate book out of all of them and it will probably always be. I hope you get a chance to download this book because I know you will love it and if you dont you will still love it anyway.
0061998494|5|I expected to read hilarious tales about Craig Ferguson's past.  While it had some humorous moments, the book was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be filled with interesting observations about America as told by a (former) outsider looking in. To my surprise it was mostly serious.<br /><br />The title is quite apt. How a hard-drinking, drug-abusing young Scot came to be a celebrated late night talk show host on a major television network in America really is an improbable story. If someone made it all up and wrote it as a screenplay, no one would believe it (or buy it). Luckily for us, Craig survived his drinking and drug-addled youth.<br /><br />American on Purpose is a well-told, warts n' all look at Mr Ferguson's life. He's not shy about who he was, and he tells his story in his own unique and charming way. If you're a fan of Craig Ferguson and haven't read this book yet, it's high time you did. What are you waiting for? Buy the damn book!

It won't win any Oscars, but who cares, this is about spending a couple of hours losing yourself and having a good time.<br /><br />Visuals are excellent and sound is awesome, especially if you have a sound system that will do it justice.

B000007MVD|5|In all my years of buying records and CD's, the live albums were usually the most disappointing. Either the technology was behind the times, or in the case of The Beatles Live at the Hollywood Bowl, the decibel level of the crowd noise made for a sub-par recording. I always enjoyed the 2 disc Live at the Star Club in Hamburg album that came out 35 years ago as a piece of early Beatles history. Then along came the Live at the BBC collection.<br /><br />As other reviews have stated, this disc proves that the Fab Four were a VERY competent live act. The Lennon quote from the Anthology Volume 1,\\"We were performers in Liverpool, Hamburg and around the dance halls... what we generated  was fantastic when we played straight rock, and there was no one that could touch us in Britain\\", is proven on these 2 CD's.I concur with the review that questions why Ringo isn't the number 2 or 3 drummer in rock history. Listen to this disc and tell me that the way he moves the song along and the fills he plays aren't proof of his talent and skill. And all of that with 4 drums, 2 cymbals and a hi-hat. Big drum kits and fancy moves do not necessarily equate with good drumming. You could apply that to all of the Beatles. Not fancy or flashy,no mega solos, just solid playing.<br /><br />Although I like the live performances of songs that also were a part of their studio output, the best stuff is their covers of American R&B, rockabilly and early rock and roll. Makes one wonder why they didn't release an album of nothing but these songs recorded in the studio. Apparently the hours and hours of tape from the Let It Be sessions give evidence that even at that late stage of their career as Beatles they still returned to their roots.<br /><br />John's vocal on \\"To Know Her Is To Love Her\\",\\" A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues\\", \\"I Got To Find My Baby\\" and  George's cover of  Carl Perkins \\"Glad All Over\\" are some of the best on these 2 discs. Their really isn't a bad track out of the bunch.<br /><br />The other thing about this set that is interesting is that much of this was recorded at the zenith of their popularity. While they could have been filling these dates with large concerts, they were fulfilling their obligation to the BBC. Whether that was at the insistence of Brian Epstein, their own sense of \\"doing the right thing\\" or a mixture of the two, it stands out in today's world of selling out to the highest bidder.<br /><br />If you're new to the whole Beatles experience, this collection gives you some good insight as to what it was all about.other thing about this set that is interesting is that much of this was recorded at the zenith of their popularity.

B0055SWM08|5|quality game.  this game has a very serene feel to it so it is perfect for anyone who just wants to mellow out and the levels are challenging enough to not make you fall asleep.  overall this game is worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone who loves puzzle games.

B00005Q4CS|4|ALL of the performances in this movie are EXCELLENT, especially Ellen Burstyn, who deservedly was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, 2000 (but somehow lost to Julia Roberts).      The movie starts off light, but gradually builds into this living nightmare, complete with SPOILER ALERT arm amputations, sexual exploits, and electroshock \\"therapy.\\"  The whole amputation thing didn't really bother me, but seeing Ellen Burstyn getting SHOCKED simply for popping diet pills like candy did.  I had NO idea that something that trivial could drive someone mad, and this madness would actually require that type of therapy, but my mother verified this information for me ... and that's because she herself went a little crazy on diet pills in her younger days.      An eye-opening movie, to say the least, but ... if you're squeamish, WATCH OUT!
B000SEIK2S|4|This is just an all around good sci/fi book. Action, aliens, humor, and drama. In the beginning of the book you start asking yourself would you make the same choice to join the CDF like our main character does, given that you both have about the same amount of knowledge on what you're really in for. But by the end of the book you're left asking yourself was it really worth it? I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next one in the series.
B003JTHXOK|5|Very good book! Filled with love and courage! It shows that o once you put your mind to something that you will never give up until you have what you want! In the end you discover it was the best decision you ever made .

B009ZQC7MY|5|I missed the first 3 seasons and discovered I could watch them on my new Kindle Fire HD - What a great series!  I can't wait for January for the new season to start!  I plan on re-watching the first 3 seasons again just in case I missed something the first time around!
B00FKF0F3C|3|I've read all of Ken Follett's and I thought this series was not as good as hoped.I would  give the book a rating of 5 out of 10.
B000ZMVAXO|4|The amp circuitry itself is awesome!  It works exactly as advertised, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small package.  Though I might like it better if it had some sort of mode selection so you could get more than one sound out of it, it's honestly a great little amp.<br /><br />The problem is with the construction.  There is no sort of strain relief whatsoever on the headphone jack, so after only a few days of use the jack's solder pads came off of the PCB.  I was only getting sound on the right channel and the sound quality was quite poor.  Opening the device up, resoldering the connection, and then adding some hot glue to hold everything together solved this problem nicely.  Not everyone has a soldering iron with them though, so I'd caution you to be careful when plugging/unplugging the headphones, be gentle, and if it breaks take it to someone with electronics experience - it's probably a 10 minute fix.<br /><br />Still, I'm quite satisfied, so 4 stars.
B00MO21WAY|5|Although it starts off slow we are in tears with the finale!

B006C5FWH8|4|I agree with one of the other reviewers that the dialog needs to be edited and that some things just aren't clear enough. I basically just try to get from drop point to extraction point without any of my knights getting killed. If there are extra things not listed on the briefing map I'm missing them. Also what to buy & whom to upgrade I'm not sure about. Oh and I'm not real sure how the prestige thing works as far as equipment goes. These are a few things that could be made clearer. Otherwise I DO find it addicting and playable even if it's not too understandable.

B007EECSFA|5|What a page turner - full of plot twists and surprises that kept me wanting to get back to this book all day and kept me up late at night. Interesting historic background with the story alternating between 1941 London (the Blitz), an event that takes place in 1961 and the lives of those trying to unravel their family history/mystery in 2011. The transitions between time periods are expertly told and the ending really surprised me.
B00005MM01|5|If you're looking for the definitive Donovan, then you've found him in this set of recordings.  It is quite simply a masterpiece of creative music.  Partly aimed at children, it is wholly aimed at adults who are not looking for sophisticated ideas and double meanings which have to be 'read into'.  <BR>You can sit back, relax and sing along with these songs, songs which have stood the test of time and which are still as fresh today as they were in the 1960s when they were first written.  Donovan clearly excelled himself and showed himself for the musical genius he truly is in these pieces.<BR>You can invest in this set of recordings with complete safety in the knowledge that you are not going to be disappointed.  Quite simply, and in the opinion of an awful lot of true Donovan fans, the best work he has ever done.
B008Y5T5ZE|2|Dull movie and slow moving. Thought it would be much better with Johnny Depp and the cast. I was very disappointed.
B004UXUUDA|3|As far as the movie's writing and directing both were well conceived but offered little new to our list of Holocaust stories other than preserve and remind us of what humans can do to each other. It seemed very \\"Diary of ...\\" like. Acting was superb. My main criticism is that the story seemed too scattered amongst all the parties presented and didn't spend much time on Sarah's family and most importantly on Sarah herself as she grew older. We are given little if no insight into her experiences and thoughts. She suddenly kills herself in a bizarre fashion. Sarah's story as an adult seemed too little and too disjointed.   On a separate thought I was struck by the parallel between what it was like to live as a Jew in those times and what it is like to live as a Palestinian in these times. Hopefully the conservative Israeli Jewish community can see that parallel also.
B00AIBZLVY|5|This is by far my favorite horror movie!!!  Well written and directed, creepy as all get out (without the gore), extraordinary child actresses, beautifully filmed and truly one of a kind. The depth and underlying messages in the film are raw and unexpected, so don't be surprised if you find yourself a little emotional after watching.<br /><br />***FASCINATING SIDE NOTE*** ~ For those that are not already aware, &#34;Mama,&#34; was played by extraordinary 6'ft 7&#34; MALE creature performer/actor, Javier Botet, who has Marfan syndrome, causing above average height, elongation of limbs/fingers/toes, abnormally flexible joints and the ability to dislocate them - producing a twisted and unnatural appearance. Despite many viewers assumptions that &#34;Mama&#34; was primarily created using digital effects, the elements used to produce her distorted appearance were primarily achieved without the use of CGI- i.e. 8 hours of makeup, prosthetic finger extensions and attaching wires to Botet's body to pull him in unnatural directions (using his ability to become disjointed and essentially operating him like a marionette), resulting in a very creepy and disturbing &#34;Mama.&#34;<br /><br />Genuinely Ingenious. Highly recommended. I rate it at 800+ stars.

B000MTFFZY|5|I think some of the best rock/metal today comes from Europe, and Delain's 'Lucidity' is a prime example. Awesome guitar perfomances teamed with fantastic vocals make this one of the best symphonic metal albums ever!!! They pulled out all the stops with artists from some of the most successful bands (Marco Hietala from Nightwish, Sharon Den Adel from Within Temptation and Liv Kristine from Leaves Eyes to name a few.) I hope this is a project they plan on repeating!
0375414053|3|Although sometimes hard to sympathize with Kate Reddy, still a fun read and probably too true to life for many. Very funny moments in this one! Will definitely look up any additional offerings from this author.
B00BT70J7M|2|I have been a fan of Kaufmann for several years.  I was leery about this album, but after reading the review in Opera News, I bought it.  Very disappointed!!  While his Wagner is excellent and his Werther is mostly very good, he is NOT a Verdi singer.  Most of the album, he is at full volume.  The few times he is not are rather nice, but he goes back to full volume elsewher in the aria.  Frankly, this album is difficult to listen to except a few numbers at a time.
B009CPES4I|3|I now know I don't need to see the sequel.

B000I2IT44|5|I stumbled across Porcupine Tree's music a couple of years ago and have loved every minute of the journey ever since.  I saw them play live last year and while nothing can take the place of being there in person, Arriving Somewhere is a resounding \\"next best thing.\\"  There's a great variety of songs across several different eras/albums and the mix and camera work is outstanding.  Some may not be a fan of the visual effects that go from color to black and white, and from clear to grainy, but these effects are just another winning touch that makes this DVD so memorable.  I grew up as a huge Rush fan, and while I wouldn't compare Rush's music to PT's music, the Tree has had the same effect on me that Rush did--I absolutely can't stop listening to and appreciating the music.  Other artists now pale in comparison to Porcupine Tree.  If you're a fan of great rock music and want to see an impressive band at its best, get this DVD.  You won't regret it.
B00BSBXZDY|5|It was very cute
B00HDMMISA|5|I loved What Alice Forgot, and this one is just as good! It's like a murder mystery among kindergarten mothers! Great entertaining read!!
0767827694|3|I watched the DVD of Orlando recently. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. The acting and the cinematography was breathtaking and excellent. But, with all of the unnarrated gazes directly into the camera,  I thought that the film could have been enhanced greatly if some of the  very rich interior narrative in the book could have been heard there (in  those spots). Even if they needed to get a different voice to read it (Lynn  Redgrave comes to mind), there were some paragraphs and sentences that we  all noted (in my recent class on this) that could have gone well during  these silences!
B004MC8CA2|5|This app is easy to use. I love all the Bible translation and reading plan choices. I look forward to my daily devotional reading and hearing from God. This is truly a blessing.
B00915G6MG|5|I have been a fan of Mark Harmon since &#34;Summer School&#34; the movie.  There nothing like the rules of life that I have now started following.  Can't wait to see what happens to the team in the upcoming seasons.
B002GHIPYI|5|fantastic.
B007SGM084|4|Loved the book's, kept me wanting to read more. Although I must say it kinda dragged towards the end but great overall.
B00IS87HYI|3|Although I like the graphics in these King games, they are billed as \\"free\\", but the time limits and prices of the power ups make that statement way less than true.  Bullbitz and Big Fish games, with limitless playing time, seem a better \\"free\\".
B000VT7AUS|5|This is perhaps my favorite album of hers and I have them all! She is really on top of her game here.<br />A great musician, artist and singer of jazz. The best jazz artist of our time!
1416595546|5|I'm not a big reader, and had this book passed on to me as one worth reading.  I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed it - an easy read, and found it hard to put down.  The main character certainly keeps you on your toes... what decisions and thoughts will she have next.  A sad ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Very funny and fun. Like a mix of temple run and subway surfers. Worth the time it takes to download.
B00622B3MY|2|not as good as cars. But my son sometime still watches it. He watches Cars way more than he does with Cars 2 though.
B00BSBR9N6|4|Nicely told romance between an odd couple. Well paced narrative with interesting characters fans of Silver Linings Playbook should check this one out.
B000FBFN1U|5|This is simply one of the best books I have ever read. Keeping track of all the characters can be a bit tricky at first, but three books in I feel like I know them all. Cannot wait to read the next one!
B00846REIS|4|Good, fast read....leagues ahead of those redundant Christian Grey novels---less S&M (thank goodness!), just as sexy, and written by someone that is literate!  Yay!!!!
0062409859|2|“Go Set a Watchman” is probably the most talked-about sequel to any book in the last fifty years – maybe more – and I’m writing a negative review of it. I liked it rather less than “To Kill a Mockingbird,” though that isn’t saying much. Now, bear with me. Please understand, I’m speaking as someone who wasn’t wild about “To Kill a Mockingbird” in the first place. It was fine and it was good and I was over it the second I closed the book in ninth grade.<br /><br />Now, if that hasn’t completely shattered your psyche, read on.<br /><br />A plot summary is hardly necessary; the bare bones of this early draft of “Mockingbird” have been splattered all over the Internet and the Arts section of nearly every newspaper in the country. All you need to know is that Scout is grown up (and now going by Jean Louise), romantically involved with someone who is not Dill, and living in New York. On a visit back to her family, she realizes that both her would-be-boyfriend and her father, the noble Atticus Finch, are bigots.<br /><br />Well, not so bad as that, but to Jean Louise, it might as well be, because it means they’ve been lying to her. All her life, she’s thought Atticus was a champion for racial equality, but now he seems to have come out as a white supremacist, if a milder one than most of them. Henry, her childhood friend who wants to be something more, has never shown any of this behavior either, but he defends her father to a point that shocks her out of any (if any; we’re given reason to think there was none) half-fancied notion of marrying him.<br /><br />This, oddly, isn’t what bothered me. Although I wasn’t thrilled to hear that the impeccable Atticus was nearly as bad as the rest, I thought there was a lot of potential for this to add depth to his character. That didn’t happen. Scout (forgive me; I can’t manage to call her Jean Louise) spends most of the book being blindly furious, and with good reason: no one ever gives hera straight answer as to why Atticus thinks the way he does and why she has never seen it before. Not ever. Uncle Jack tries, but he couches it so thoroughly in a literature-sodden history lesson that I wasn’t able to make head or tail of it. If you could, great, but I guess I just wasn’t smart enough.<br /><br />Actually, that sums up my feelings toward most of the rest of the book: either I’m not smart enough or I’m not patient enough or Harper Lee is writing in circles. I would read lines that were supposed to be biting, satirical, funny, and just wrinkle my eyebrows. I would skim over descriptions of place and time, longing for something to actually happen in this story. Because almost nothing does. By telling you what I already have, I’ve pretty near spoiled the entire book. There’s just not that much plot to spoil.<br /><br />I didn’t hate everything, though.  I liked the little sequences of Scout’s childhood after “Mockingbird,” especially the one where she tries desperately to fit in at her first school dance. And although the other characters didn’t address Atticus’s true colors well, I thought he himself did a decent job of it. At least he didn’t attack anyone else’s beliefs. And I’ll try not to, either. If you love this book like a child, that’s fine. If you dislike it in comparison to the first, that’s fine. And if you don’t even want to read it, that’s fine too. But I don’t regret the read – because if nothing else, I can say I have read the most talked-about sequel to any book in the last fifty years and then proceed to talk about it. Even if no one wants to hear.
B009XIXVU6|5|This is the best book I have read in years. I didn't want it to end,how ever the lead-in to the Greek doctor was to long,alll in all I would highly recommend it.
B0058Z4NR8|5|The thesis is clear, the examples easy to understand. If power is consolidated, then economics will be consolidated, which ruins economies. Selfishness destroys.
0783229372|4|Why is this movie not available in Blu-Ray?  The DVD is only standard definition 480i.  If a Blu-Ray edition is not to be made available please at least update the DVD to \\"anamorphic\\", \\"enhanced for widescreen tv\\" so that it can be played on an upscaling DVD player to \\"near 1080p\\" in it's proper widescreen format without having to make adjustments to DVD and/or TV settings. Yes, the movie is mostly fiction with the true story of \\"The Hindenburg\\" only as a backdrop, but I do find it entertaining and George C. Scott is always good.
B004XWLN20|5|I gotta say, while i have not purchashed this particular box set, i have been watching smallville for ages and own seasons 1-9 on dvd and looking forward to season 10 hitting australia, i think this is the best tv show ever, i have watched the series all the way through, then watched 7-9 again and now i'm watching it all the way through again. I love what they have done with the series, although a few things they could have done differently regarding the story line, but it's still and always will be my fav show. I love how they went from Clark as a teenager discovering his powers and eventually getting to superman, i'm sure if DC were not happy with it all they would not have approved it, so if they are happy with it i'm happy with it after all they are just telling stories that maybe weren't covered by the comics

0062314327|5|I love Neil Gaiman. While I was listening to this, (which I do a lot because I have a two hour commute) I was telling the story to my co-worker every night. She loved the story. She even found the T&#62;V. series on HULU and started watching it. It is a great novel!!! Full of exciting characters and an imaginative world that only could exist in our dreams.
B0053FANRC|5|This third movie, \\"The Fast and the Furious:Tokyo Drift,\\" is my favorite movie so far in this franchise. I liked the original [[ASIN:B0018OFN1S The Fast and the Furious]] and also [[ASIN:B0018OFN3Q 2 Fast 2 Furious]]. I wasn't expecting to like \\"Tokyo Drift\\" as much as I did.<br /><br />I liked the casting, especially Lucas Black. The music was dynamite. And I had never seen drifting before. It was like cars dancing on screen. Hokey, I know but that's what it made me think of. And I loved the Tokyo locales.<br /><br />Fast, furious and definitely fun!
B00DR0PDNE|5|This is a great device, its a cheap way to get Programming to any television in you house. I Recommend
B007HGPBRC|5|I have never read Hitchens before this book, but had heard a lot about him. I saw an article about &#34;Mortality&#34; in The New Yorker and decided to read it. After losing my father to esophageal cancer only about a month ago, it sparked my interest and I was looking for something philosophical to help ease my pain. Although I wouldn't say the book eased my pain, I do feel better knowing that my father wasn't the only one who, when dealing with such a disgusting disease, reacted the way he did. This book gave me an insight into the battle with cancer that my father couldn't give me. Well worth reading.
B0045HCJRG|4|Loved it when I first saw it and liked it upon seeing it again a decade later.  Family oriented and suitable for older children and adults.  Very innocent topic but the modern kinks have been thrown into it which render it unsuitable and unsavory for younger audiences.

It all goes well together - it is very seamless and congruent.  Congratulations on your success and popularity.  Please keep up the Fantastic work.  I believe they even have the potential to do better!  Please take the next one to 11 without losing the core sound and feel.

B00005LC3Y|3|Kubrick is a phony, a fake and a sham.  Do not believe the hype folks, Kubrick at his best is a mediocre film-maker. Don't believe me, then u should watch A.I.  Despite Spielberg's attempt to salvage the project, the movie still turns out to be absolute garbage with great cinematography.  Full Metal Jacket is only worth watching right until the end of boot camp, basically the first half-hour or so. After boot-camp, comes the war scenes.  Here, Kubrick attempts to be an insightful and original director.  This futile excercise only insults the inteligence of any individual possessing an I.Q higher than that of a senile goat.  There is almost no character development in this movie therefore one is always left guessing the motive behind the 80% of the actions of the characters.  The movie does not end it simply stops.  After it stops, you realize the movie really had no point and Kubrick is no Tarantino.  However I still bought the DVD because of the phenomenal performance of Lee Hermey who plays the drill instructor.

B00BAXFECK|3|I understand why this book won the  Pulitzer Prize. Donna Hartt proves she is a wonderful author. She makes the setting of her book, New York City and Las Vegas come alive. She makes you see the different characters of the book in intimate ways.  She keeps you interested and wanting to see how it will all come to an end.  But, I wanted to like Theo, and I didn't.  I felt as if he threw away the life that he was given and I was sad for him.  But, in the end, it is only a book...Maybe the best thing we can hope for, is to realize that the author can help us all see the fragility of life and how easy it is to take it all for granted.  For that, the author was a success.
B0017U7PT6|5|This is probably one of the best adventure films of the year.  It took me to a place I had not been before.  It showed me Wholly Mammoths and Saber Tooth tigers, and races long extinct.   Leave your history lesson at the door, and just enjoy the rollicking adventure of prehistoric man fighting oppression.  You might learn something.  Oppression still exists in the world in 2008 A.D.
B00003CWN3|5|i've pretty much stopped writing reviews, but this movie drew me back into the ring.  i usually have a strong point of view with things i read or watch, and can critique them comfortably, but not with this one.  all i know is that i felt disturbed, and slept horribly, after watching it.  i think it kicked up some real deep stuff in me.  but i still give it five stars, because its quality shined through.<br />incidentally, i almost stopped watching it entirely a couple of times during the film.  this was a film that like FEW others i could call TRULY DEPRESSING.  the crux of what made it feel depressing for me was that it was about a human being who was so STUCK in their life.  there felt like so few options for brandon, like his/her only choice was to live a lie.  it's like he/she so wanted to be something he/she wasn't that she/he just had to pile on lie after lie.  that's what killed me.  it was a story about a person who just SIMPLY DID NOT FIT IN OUR SOCIETY.  that's i guess what this film was about.  it was a major criticism about our society - a society that just accepts people who fit into narrow little windows of sex, sexual orientation - and certainly gender.  god, if i can't even comfortably choose a pronoun (he/she) for brandon, how would it feel to BE brandon...or teena?<br />i really do think brandon was neither a man nor a woman, a boy nor a girl.  he/she was a person somewhere in the middle, and because of our society's small-minded ways brandon just did the best he/she could...and picked a team and started playing.  she felt more like a man and tried going that way.  i myself am a therapist, and wondered how i would have dealt with a patient like brandon.  suggested a sex-change?  suggested more self-acceptance?  suggested anything?  cried?<br />one other thing that got me, and that i found painful, was that brandon's problems were not just about gender - and his/her gay friend summed it up nicely about the consequences of his/her destructive criminal/lying/irresponsible tendencies, from what i remember.  \\"brandon, you're either gonna end up in jail for a long time...or dead.\\"  the moment when the carpet got pulled out from under me emotionally in the film was when brandon was in court waiting to face sentencing for car theft...and he/she turned around and walked out.  it was like placing the kiss of death on herself.<br />so, i know this is a rambling review.  i hope it's helped someone somewhat, and i know it's helped me to write it.  i just found this film so disturbing, and it just shines the light for me on the fact that we live in a world that makes it VERY VERY hard for some people to live a happy, well-adjusted life.  i guess in our own ways it's hard for all of us.<br />got bless brandon...i wish you'd had better luck.l/lying/irresponsible tendencies, from what i remember.  \\"brandon, you're either gonna end up in jail for a long time...or dead.\\"  the moment when the carpet got pulled out from under me emotionally in the film was when brandon was in court waiting to face sentencing for car theft...and he/she turned around and walked out.  it was like placing the kiss of death on herself.<br />so, i know this is a rambling review.  i hope it's helped someone somewhat, and i know it's helped me to write it.  i just found this film so disturbing, and it just shines the light for me on the fact that we live in a world that makes it VERY VERY hard for some people to live a happy, well-adjusted life.  i guess in our own ways it's hard for all of us.<br />got bless brandon...i wish you'd had better luck.

B00EEDJHXA|5|First of there are 5x5 5x6 6x6 7x6 7x7 puzzles. Each set has 200 + 200 pro levels.<br />You can fly through most the 5x5 and 6x5 in less than  30 seconds easy. But the real challenge begins when you hit the 6x6 puzzles. I just reached them and am no longer flying through these things with ease. Enjoyed this the whole time flying through 20 puzzles in 10 minutes up until now. This was pretty enjoyable.<br />GAMEPLAY: match two or more  buttons to remove them from the puzzle. Color based matching system. Can't be a off cooled button between the two buttons. Easy to grasp and easy to do.<br />A few tricks you have to get good at to be faster are even out of number of buttons (tells you if you need to match things in groups of twos or threes) and assignment buttons. Does button A only align with one other button? If yes it can only match that button thus you know not to match other buttons with that one or you'll fail.<br /><br />Overall really enjoyable game to play in short spans. 0 ads, opens really easily, and has always run smoothly with light battery drain.<br />Worth the price if you're into these types of games. Just don't let the over easy ones bog you down on the game not being puzzly enough as it gets better.<br />Remove options are touch and swipe. Swipe didn't always work well for me. But the tapping was pretty good for some reason game has a slide function and miss taking can deselect the button you were on minor annoyance when you miss tap.
B00377V6J2|5|Just finished watching the DVD for the second time last night. Almost 1 1/2 hours of pure electric blues. I think this is unique. When do you get two blues players like this together \\"in session\\", and preserved like this to enjoy after they are gone? Other reviews are providing a lot of great details so I won't rehash it, but here are some reasons for 5 stars: 1)great picture and sound, 2)including full length uncut songs/jams, 3)pretty good choice of camera shots for the most part, although at times I wanted to see the hands, not just the face, 4)one-of-a-kind session.     I wish ALL available footage was on the DVD, but what is here truly satisfies the craving for unmatched electric blues, and I'm thrilled it was made available, and at a fair price.

0393343405|4|This is a great book, in the sense that it engages the reader and fires the imagination, and is probably not a particularly defensible book if viewed from the point of view of a professional academic. The author has a point of view and a grand conclusion and he selects those facts, stories and speculation that support or illuminate his thesis. If you read the reviews and comments on this site closely you will find a number of qualifications, objections, quibbles and major disagreements with the author's conclusions and with aspects of his argument.<br /><br />But, luckily, I am not being called upon to rule on a poorly sourced or misguided doctoral dissertation. I am just an interested amateur enjoying a bravura work of creative, romantic non-fiction. I enjoy John McPhee, but am willing to allow that there are probably lots of errors in his non-fiction books, as enjoyable as they may be. I am professionally accomplished regarding legal matters, and can say that most journalistic treatments of topics like the United States Supreme Court are incomplete and shallow at best and almost laughable at their commonest. That doesn't make them uninteresting; it just means they are not authoritative and are unlikely to withstand rigorous criticism.<br /><br />That said, this book entertains, it prompts thought, it leads to little aha! moments, and it shines some light on topics with regard to which I am generally in the dark. Since I won't be relying on this text in order to perform brain surgery, and instead am reading it for pleasure, I am happy to report that it is a pleasing effort. Consistent with the author's point - perhaps that is enough.
B000EQ4G5K|1|Lucky Barbadian born R&B/reggae singer rihanna, has reached new levels of anoying with her sophmore effort entiled 'A Girl Like Me'. Rihana's voice and ablum is so rediculously terrible and anoying, they deserve a prey.    God in heaven please let a record company sign some with actual talent, who can really sing, who is really pretty and doesn't just wear tones of expensive make up and weave.    Let there be a new artist who has something to bring people who actually like real music.     Rihanna is wack and I actually like beyonce' and think she is extremly talented (did you see the bet awards). Rihanna sounds like Beyonce minus talent, years of experience, vocal training and constant practice as a child with Destiny's Child.    Beyonce get 5 stars, no talent rihanna gets 0 stars.    Music Lovers if we are lucky by this time next year we won't remmember the musical mistake that was rihannah.

B0006284JQ|4|*sigh* What can I say about Miss Spears that hasn't been said? Well, we all know she is not a great vocal talent, but I can't knock her off too hard. I admire her for taking risks and trying new things and this is what her greatest hits cd shows. In past reviews, I have been hard on Britney's past efforts (even though I liked her \\"In The Zone\\" cd). But as I was driving in my car, listening to this cd I had to admit that her music made me sing and tap my feet. If anything, Britney smartly surrounded herself with amazing producers who knew how to work her voice with their sounds and they did a great job and she did a great job with the presentation of it. Even though I think a greatest hits cd from Britney is premature, I hope she uses her time off to GROW as an artist. Take some voice lessons and learn how to play an instrument. If she doesn't, its the end of her career.

B00JFBCDD2|5|What I like about these stripped-down versions is you hear these songs from a slightly different perspective and you can actually understand all the lyrics on some of the songs as Stipe was forced to actually enunciate in the absence of heavier instrumentation. Buck's mandolin technique is limited but works well with the band, obviously. Love the keyboards and the percussion. Mills' bass is always spot on.

B000059TFO|4|I have read reviews of Mississippi Burning that range from waxing poetic about its power to those that despise its use of disturbing images to elicite an \\"autonomic response\\" of disgust and anger from the audience.  Having viewed the movie several times, I realize that the latter's claims are not entirely without merit.  That being said, Mississippi Burning is one of my favorite movies.  <br />I don't know much about the situation in the South before the present day.  For that matter, I don't know much about it now.  I have no idea if things were as bad as they were portrayed in the movie.  Having seen pictures of lynchings, though, as well as the festival-like atmosphere that accompanied them, I can't imagine that the film was too far off base.  The atmosphere of fear and hate that pervades the film is almost visible.  It's hard to imagine anyone being able to survive it with their humanity intact.  <br />Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as the two FBI agents are an interesting study in contrasts.  Hackman, as a former Good Ol' Boy sheriff, sees stublety and patience as the necessary tools to solve the three civil rights workers' disappearances.  Dafoe, as a Kennedy recruit from the Justice Department, sees an intense show of federal strength and sheer investigative force as the way to go.  Dafoe is an idealist, Hackman is a realist.  The one thing they have in common is a disgust for the way blacks are treated in the South.  I must admit I found Hackman's performance more convincing than Dafoe's, perhaps because his was a more complex character.  A product of two worlds, one of racism and one of unity, his must not have been an easy life.  And of course, Frances McDormand is brilliant as the long-suffering wife of a Klan member/Sheriff's deputy.  She is disgusted with what's going on with blacks in her town, but cannot do anything about it.  Her sense of fear and entrapment in a prison of hate have a claustrophobic feel to them that is palpable.<br />I do wish the movie hadn't used quite so many stereotypes in its potrayals of secondary characters, particularly blacks.  I don't think there was a single scene in the movie that didn't show blacks as being the victims of some hate crime or other.  It got so bad I couldn't see a black face without getting nervous for his or her continued good health.  Surely *someone* in the black community decided to say \\"enough is enough\\"?  <br />Also, the idea that everyone in Mississippi was (a) in the KKK, (b) black, or (c) a passive, approving bystander is an injustice to human nature.  Situations are always more complex than they seem, and this one was no different, I'm sure.  Oh well, it's not entirely the director's fault.  He only had two hours.  <br />This movie understands racism, is able to dig into the wellspring of hatred and sniveling and air it to the world.  I've never been able to completely comprehend racism on anything other than an intellectual level.  That it existed, I never had any doubt, but it's one thing to know it, but it's something else to really *know* it.  And once you do know it, it's like staring in a funhouse mirror.  You can see the image, but you're unable to force the shape you see into the shape you *think* should be there.  This movie provides you with that gut abilty.
1935251740|2|I've bought this book after hearing much praise of it on TV. I thought this would be something Hawking or Brian Greene style (I have several Hawking and Greene books and love reading them for pleasure). So, I thought it will be  a science book presenting some new theory of time.<br /><br />This book however is vulgar mix of cheap philosophy, science X-Files style, melodramatic memoirs/mysticism Carlos Castaneda style, vague religious pantheistic ideas and other such vulgar stuff. Donnie Darko movie style that's what it is. But the Donnie Darko movie did have a clear idea to present and this book does not.<br /><br />Who am I an idiot teenage girl from some distant village to read this stuff, if I want to read this stuff I do have better works. I can read Castaneda, Lewis, Coelho for better entertainment. For science I can read Hawking and Greene. This book is neither quality science nor quality fiction. It will insult your intellect. Avoid it.

B0001ZX0OM|5|(...)<br />MYSTIC RIVER plays like a modern day Greek tragedy, full of pathos, remorse, guilt, failure in love, etc.  Brian Helgeland is to be commended for his faithful adaptation of Dennis Lehane's brilliant book.  Clint Eastwood is to be commended for his superb direction, getting remarkable performances from his outstanding cast.  Those who didn't like this movie probably aren't the kind who like a slower moving film, and one that can ultimately only end tragically, with no resolutions firmly established.  I found it to be a moving, disturbing film, one that would have won more Oscars had it not been up against the Lord of the Rings Return of the King.  Apples and oranges...those two films are so different it's hard to compare their excellences.  While The Return of the King is a fantastic film, MYSTIC RIVER is equally impressive but for different reasons.<br />Sean Penn, Cinema's ultimate bad boy, brings a depth to the character of Jimmy Markham that I would not have imagined.  Overacting?  How can a parent not over-react to the terrible tragedy of losing his oldest daughter.  Penn shows the inner torment, the guilt of having spent time in prison and losing his wife, and trying to discover his daughter.  A man who is a devout Catholic, ironically has chosen a life of crime to support his family.  Penn devastates with his performance and deserved his Oscar, hands down.<br />Tim Robbins as Dave is likewise brilliant and he too deserved his supporting Oscar.  His scene with his wife in discussing vampirism and how he likens it to his life is chilling.  \\"Sometimes it gets in you, and you can't get rid of it.\\"  The devastating effects of his childhood abduction have shaped his life, and shamed him enough that he won't tell the truth about where he was on the night of Katie's murder.<br />Kevin Bacon, one of our most underappreciated actors, shines in his role as Sean, the third of the boyhood friends, who as a homicide detective has to confront old pains in finding out who killed Penn's daughter.  His own failed marriage is exemplified in the telephone conversations with his wife who won't even talk to him.  Bacon deserved a nomination, but his role isn't quite as showy as the other two.<br />Oscar winner and nominee Marcia Gay Harden is heartbreaking as Robbins' wife who finds herself confused at her husband's behavior and the blood on his body the night of Katie's murder.  Her ultimate fear and confession to Penn leads to tragedy.  Harden's scene where she waves frantically to her young son in the final parade scene is heartbreaking.<br />Laura Linney, one of our finest actresses, shines in the role of Annabeth, Jimmy's supportive and ambitious wife.  She deserved a nomination but again since her role wasn't too flashy and she didn't have a lot of screen time, she was overlooked.  But feast in Linney's talent in the scene where she tells Jimmy he could be king and rule their world.  Her own agenda and ambition are coldly captured, and Linney is superb in conveying that.<br />Also excellent in smaller roles are Thomas Guiry as Brandon, the boyfriend of Katie, who was going to run off with her to Las Vegas, and Laurence Fishburne as Bacon's cynical hardboiled partner.<br />The entire cast is perfect, and the movie packs an emotional wallop rarely captured in today's youth-oriented cinema.<br />MYSTIC RIVER is a cinematic experience of immeasurable power, and does justice to a most exceptional novel.

B000096I9G|4|I bought this DVD solely for the performance of the Pornography album, my and many others' favorite Cure album. The only  disappointment with the performance--and unfortunately it's a major one--is that the drummer plays behind the beat on nearly every song. This gives the impression that the band is constantly running out of steam. For such an intense album, this dragginess saps a lot of power from these songs. <br />There are two exceptions, though: \\"The Figurehead\\" which sounds slightly more relaxed and melodic than the album version; and an absolutely amazing performance of \\"Cold\\"--if only the whole set could have been this good! <br />On the minus side, \\"Short Term Effect\\" and \\"Pornography\\" don't come off too well because of the dissonant Arabic guitar lines that never quite match up properly.<br />Generally, though, everything in the set sounds good but the drumming. In the interview section of the disc the drummer admits being slightly uncomfortable playing these older songs. Going to the Bloodflowers set you can hear how much better he is playing his own parts.<br />As far as the rest of the DVD is concerned, I enjoyed:<br />The Interviews, especially Robert's<BR>Stage, Light Show<BR>Simon Gallup's stage presence w/ low slung bass a la Paul Simonon/Peter Hook<br />Definitely worth a rental...
B004XJRQUQ|5|Amazing books! Highly addictive, you won't want to put it down! This is my second time reading them and still I am saddened when I reach the end.
0812416236|2|Though I had heard of Agatha Christie and her classic Murder on the Orient Express, I didn't know much about it. However, being a fan of the Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series, I was quite excited to read another classic mystery novel. Unfortunately, by the time I got halfway through the book my disappointment started to set in.    The problem with this book is that there is absolutely nothing driving the plot forward. Even with the old \\"the murderer is still aboard the train\\" plot-line, Christie manages to make this story as boring as possible. We know, for example, that there is no present danger to any of the current passengers because we learn early on that the murder was for the sake of a very specific revenge. We also learn early on that the murdered man was a despicable and infamous character, so none of the passengers were very distraught over his death (in fact, many of them seemed happy about it). Even the detective, Christie's famous Hercule Poirot, seemed like he was only interested in the case because he had nothing better to do at the time.    To add to this, Christie's writing is tedious. The structure of the novel consists of interview after interview (and even several re-interviews) of every passenger on the coach. There are interesting red-herrings, but they obscure the plot too much and they all seem to only be revealed at the very end (rather than slowly throughout the course of the novel).  I didn't enjoy this book, and, frankly, it makes me want to avoid Agatha Christie's books altogether.
B00FAX6XQC|5|I love the fact that they incorporate the sway that you encounter when actually trying to get a clean kill!
1608871088|5|Beautiful, inspiring artwork! It's very carefully constructed and shows really nice concept artwork from the beginning stages of designing characters and settings to the very end. Great for aspiring and professional artists!
B00D6DVSAE|5|This Double CD of Sting was a great addition to my collection. I highly recommend it to any Sting fan.
B00CWQAFT6|4|What a pleasant surprise this band was. Symphonic female-fronted hair metal that's really a lot better than it sounds. Solid album; no bad songs here, and a few great ones.
B00BB22GQM|5|so i started listening  to this record thinking \\" well these are the guys that made Contra, and it was a perfectly listenable record\\". You know, the one witht he song about  cousins......haha.  It had some pretty listenable tunes, if not a bit poppy.    But then they made this record.  I popped it in the CD player expecting a good listen, but wait, this thing seems really good. Better listen to it again......    6 plays later...holy crap this is a fantastic record. It seems i start playing it and next thing you know i have listened to the whole thing. I dont wanna call it rock but i dont wana call it pop either....all  i can say is this album is epic.  give it a listen.
B00CATSONE|5|Very Informative!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Upon finishing this book, I felt like I was reading AIA... I wanted to know what happened to van hougnten.... Did he ever finish the sequel?? Did Hazel ever get over Agustus? What happened to Isaac and Monica?  So many questions unanswered....
B0064X7FVE|5|This app gives me instant weather conditions when I´m traveling. A friend was tracing to OK and I was able to show him where the storm was.
B005LAIGN2|5|Love it and would encourage others to rent or own.  Have meet some of the airmen before at an airshow and they are a proud bunch of guys as we should be proud of them too.

B009IAIC5I|5|CLASSIC, A MUST FOR TRUE MAIDEN FANS. THE BEST WAY TO LISTEN TO METAL. NEED THE ENTIRE COLLECTION ON VINYL
B00CWVFPGO|5|Arnold Schwarzenegger  is so awesome  in the movie and  the cast is perfect  the best movie  of 2013
B00BGIC2J2|1|Filthy. Couldn't finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway Surfers is a great game that can keep you interested with the changing boards and mini goals. My family competes across the board. It is great that you do not have to spend money to play.
B000BCE918|5|I have been a dinofan since my earliest recollection and that goes back about 50 years at least.  These 3 movies are the epitome of technology and the acting is also top-notch.  Anyone who enjoys dino movies will certainly be enthralled by these masterpieces!
B00I8H6X58|5|Great movie, acting and the story were awesome!  Hard to believe this is how it was in 1985.  Easy to see why Matthew McConahay won  the oscar!
B00005N83M|4|Well,I have read all the reviews, and people keep on harping on the fact that she CANT sing! Ok, she does have vocal talents, she just needs to have a vocal coach to extent her range. Mostly, this is just her second album, and she is still trying everything, maybe on the next album she will refine one sound. I dont compare La Lopez to other artists like Christina(who can sing, my God, she won a Grammy!) and Britney, who really has no talent at all! <BR>I think J. Lo is just having fun with something. She is just enjoying the ability to entertain people. Nowadays, with all the bad things in the world, someone should be doing something.<BR>Anyway, I think she does have some weak songs-her slow jams&quot;Secretly&quot; and &quot;Come over&quot; are not the best. But, the hits &quot;Im Real&quot;, &quot;Love...&quot; and so on are good, with &quot;Play&quot; being one of the best songs along with &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, the album is not so bad. But, in my opinion, she sings much better in Spanish, her voice is much stronger! <BR>Anyway, buy it, it isnt so bad, at least not as bad as some trash out there today....Britney, BSB, NSync....etc...
B00004XMS0|3|The film version of BATMAN saw director Tim Burton ditch the campy 60s \\"KAPOW!\\" action and outrageous villians and go much deeper and darker. Michael Keaton IS Batman, evoking the same troubled character from the DC comics, and of course, Jack Nicholson as The Joker, a great character played brilliantly. Burton, master of the bizzare, was the perfect man to bring the legendary comic book to the screen, and he does it wonderfully. Danny Elfman's excellent score is another added plus, and the action is well done. The look of Gotham City is inventive and fascinating, creating a nuance of comic book-styled-action and dark storytelling.<br /><br />BATMAN RETURNS is much darker than the first film, yet still satisfying, popcorn-munching fun, with an apt blend of comic book action and trademark Burton weirdness. With Michael Keaton returning as the bat, Danny DeVito as the creepy pengiun and Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy Catwoman, Batman Returns has everything fans could want. The styilised look of Gotham City is fantastic. Danny Elfman's exciting yet creepy score fits perfectly with the film's tone. The only thing slightly amiss is the plot, but that hardly matters when it's Burton at the helm, and a sharp script and some witty one-liners make up for it's flaws.<br />BATMAN FOREVER has it's flaws, but it's still a solid entry into the franchise. Val Kilmer takes over the role of Bruce Wayne, and while he's not as good as Michael Keaton, he manages to portray the character well. Joining Kilmer is Chris O'Donnell as Robin, and the bad guys; Tommy Lee Jones as the disfigured \\"Two Face\\" and the suitably manic Jim Carrey as the crazed Riddler.  There are problems; the action takes over most of the time, leaving little in the way of exposition or plot for that matter. And the vertigo-inducing camera angles and frenetic pacing leaves the audience wanting something perhaps a little more grounded.<br />And then BATMAN AND ROBIN came along and killed the franchise. One of the worst movies ever made. Joel Schumacher owes me two hours of my life back!es ever made. Joel Schumacher owes me two hours of my life back!
B00AP06III|5|Did awesome playing and I will be buying more from Amazon.
B000J103PC|5|My husband and I Netflix-ed this movie.  And he didnt' want to send it back.  I told him, \\"just buy it!\\" But he didn't want to spend the money.  So I did it for him.  He could watch and quote from this movie endlessly.  Very enjoyable.  I higly recommend it to anyone who likes clothing and a good story about \\"finding oneself.\\"
B001AQO3QA|5|good
B002APS61I|3|its ok
B000XUBFE2|5|This story was very touching and I am so glad that I decided to read it. I look forward to reading more of the author's books in the future.
030758836X|2|This book was recommended to me by five people...most of whom know I love most of Tana French's work madly. So I was really looking forward to it and was totally and completely disappointed. Good writer, interesting idea, but who the heck does one care about? Or root for? And, after murder and character weakness and twists of plot and leaps of faith poorly rewarded, I was mostly left wondering just why Ms. Flynn wrote this story? I just didn't get the point, and frankly found it in all ways unbelievable and unsatisfying that two such dingbat maniacs ended up together. If one is looking for DuMurier's pessimism but total character believability, or for French's natural and realistic complexity of good and bad in each of us, don't look here.
B002H1J2AO|5|John Belushi at the beginning of a short meteoric career.  It does play a bit thin, but only because we've had the opportunity to see it many times.  The HD remake is a whole new movie.  If you haven't seen this, check it out.
B00FCQQ1IW|3|I liked the story but did not know it would continue in an upcoming book.  Not familiar with Clifton Chronicles.
B0008F1146|4|Ok let's face the obvious; Roadrunner has been constantly spitting out these 25th anniversary Re-releases as an easy cash grab from the fans.  Since they already re-released the rest of the albums from Max Cavalerea years, why not re-release roots?  Well, when I had first heard this news, I was excited and jumping with joy.  Roots was my first Sepultura album and one of my personal favorites, I practically have the thing memorized word for word and note for note.  Now I realize this is a long review so if you want a short version, then skip to the last paragraph.  If you want all the details, then read on from here.   <br /> <br />I checked websites weekly for updates as to what the bonus track would be on the second disc.  Roadrunner stated that it would be 15 songs, but they didn't release the track list till months later.  When they finally did, I was shocked to see that it was 13 songs instead of 15.  I looked back at the roadrunner website and there were still banners up on the website claiming that it would have 15 songs!  What happened to the three missing songs?!  And to top it off, most of the songs were previously released on the B-Side/Live disc Blood Rooted.   <br /> <br />Now I'm a Sepultura fanatic so eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I gave in and bought it.  This is the third time I've bought Roots.  I have the original copy, the rare import The Roots of Sepultura and now this one.   <br /> <br />The most interesting part of the whole package is probably the artwork and the 23 page booklet.  The lyrics part of the booklet has been changed, having the colors screwed around with (it actually looks pretty cool) as well as pictures of Jon Davis, Mike Patton, the tribe, Ross Robinson, members of the band and so forth.  The main problem was that most of it dealt with the recording process so much that they weren't able to include all the info they could have.  The Re-release of the Soulfly album does a better job (in terms of the booklet) because it gave some info about every song.  The Lyrics for Lookaway are still not present because they were written by Jon Davis.  They don't mention the guitarists from Korn helping out with Ratamahatta on percussion, nor do they mention anything about Carlinhos Brown (who also played on Ratamahatta and Ambush).  A large portion goes into the recording process for the untitled track at the end of the album.  This 13 minute improve jam goes by two names.  The booklet refers to it as Canyon Jam, if you insert it in your Computer or look online it comes up as Little Wood-Music, so which is it?  There are other things included such as their journey to the Xavantes tribe, but there are still several things that are left unanswered to the die hard fanatic.  Like with the bonus material, why did they decide to cover Celtic Frost and Bob Marley? They are great songs but I would like to know why.  It feels incomplete and a bit of a let down.  Just compare the booklets from Roots and the Soulfly album and the Soulfly one ends up as the winner.  It was simply done better.  However if you compare the overall music, Roots annihilates the competitor.   <br /> <br />Alright, enough with the booklet, does the bonus material make it worth the cash?  Well let's go over all the previously unreleased material and that which was left off Blood Rooted.   <br /> <br />5. Mine (Andy Wallace Mix): I don't understand why the reviewer Wobby praises this track as much as he did, but this is not a remix, this is an extended Mix, not a remix.  There is an additional 4 seconds at the beginning and probably a minute and half added to the end.  If there is an actual difference, then it's not easily noticeable.   <br />8. R.D.P. (Demo): I'm convinced that this is demo cover of a Ratos De Poro song, but I'm not too sure which one.  Sepultura previously covered their song Crucificados Pelo Sistema.  It's Definitely an awesome song.   <br />9. Untitled (Demo): An instrumental that was never improved on, probably the best song here, it could have been a second We Who Are Not As Others.   <br />10. Attitude (Live): This was on an Ozzfest CD so its nice to have it on an actual sepultura CD for the first time.   <br />11. Roots Bloody Roots (Megawatt Mix 1): very strange, not too good, but definitely better then the next track.   <br />12. Roots Bloody Roots (Megawatt Mix 2): absolutely unbearable.  It sounds like a really bad Soulfly remix.  With the exception of Max yelling, you couldn't be able to tell what this was in the first place.  Horrible, horrible remix.  I will bet that these two remixes were made recently at the last minute by someone at Roadrunner.   <br /> <br />The next time Roadrunner decides to release some old Sepultura rarities (which they probably will within the next five years) they better just make a Blood Rooted vol. 2.  There is plenty of live bootleg material that they can place on it and if you look hard enough, there is a rare Desperate Cry Vinyl Single that has a track titled Sweet Leaf (probably a Black Sabbath cover) and I'm sure there are plenty more demos.   <br /> <br />Alright here's my conclusion as to whether or not this Re-release is worth the money.  If you do not have any version of Roots, then definitely buy this version.  If you already have the original version; you can skip this entirely or buy one used at a cheap price or get it as a gift.  I personally do not like to support these cash grabbing re-releases so that's what I did; I received it as a gift.  The music is definitely worth 5 stars, but the overall letdown of unreleased material removes a star.  Hoped this helped and thanks for reading.
0545670314|5|love this trilogy. suspense from beginning to end.
B009ZFPQOQ|5|At first, I didn't know whether or not I'd like it. I've used several apps in the past as a tool to determine times, location, best routes, etc., while driving. I've not found an app that was either accurate, timely or efficient. So, I was reticent about using another one. Wow, was I in for a treat though! This started off as a great app. I was able to control location, settings and menu items right away. I wondered how many others were using this app and it didn't take long to see. It's one thing to have a million users but if you spread that out across the USA, that's not many per location! I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were a lot of Waze users around my neighborhood as well as on my way to work! It's saved me a lot of time, headache and stalls in traffic! I've thoroughly enjoyed this app and I use it every day. Great application for travel for long distances and the daily rat race to and from work, school, etc.<br /><br />I'd LOVE to see a way where Waze could give some room to Pandora at the bottom or top or even side to the screen so I wouldn't have to flip back and forth between these apps to give Pandora a thumbs up or down on their random music! Other than that, this app is great!
B008K8VDPU|5|I think it's great it works way better than other piano apps I have used and works every time! And I can play a lot of my favorite songs!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5|This was a sensational book.  Love at first bite.  The main character was just about every woman fantasy. Good Read
B00J8CGU64|4|I was aware that this movie said the F word more times than any other movie. It's not like I had to prepare myself. It didn't even phase me.  I was completely unprepared for all the sex and nude scenes. Just be aware.<br /><br />The movie was good from an entertainment standpoint but it wasn't amazing. It's good enough if you've got nothing better to do.
B00AB7HESI|1|This game does not install properly. I get an error message on every attempt to install on multiple high speed connections. &quot;There was an error while attempting to install scribblenauts remix please try again&quot; WASTE OF MONEY!!!
B000002RXS|5|All this controversy about one of the greatest singers that ever lived is really amusing. When I heard her singing this I thought she was made to sing Carmen. This dark, seductive voice is perfect for the sexy gypsy. And Gedda, Giuot and Massard are absolutely amazing in their roles. Pretre conducts with fire, the sound is awesome. In one word: Essential!
B00FB13Y74|5|This app is so great!!!! I love angrybirds and I have to say this is my favorite angrybirds game so far since star wars!!! If you get the chance, you should totally buy this app!!
B00L9B7IKE|4|It was a little depressing the first few chapters, but evolved into a really clever mystery.  The ending was the perfect twist of the knife.
031286504X|5|I was stunned to learn that this story is actually a short novella, and even more stunned that Richard Matheson was able to pack so much into so few pages.<br /><br />The story of a last man standing in a world radically altered by a virus that turns the world's population into a human/vampire species, is singularly focused through the eyes of our hero, Robert Neville, and written with a focus that makes this tale very powerful.<br /><br />Matheson draws the reader into Robert Neville's plight quickly, and then effortlessly begins to build the tension of psychological torture he feels during his days and nights alone, trapped within his house and his thoughts.  The secondary horror is trying to stay a step a head of a nightly group of Vampires looking to, of course, drink his blood.  The skill of Matheson forces the reader into this hell of loneliness and really sells this horror from all angles.  From resisting his desires, to controlling his anger, to repressing his memory and longing for the world before the virus; the mental pain Robert Neville experiences in a society where he doesn't belong is stunningly told.<br /><br />An interesting twist is how Matheson uses the Vampire legend to feed into our beliefs and superstitions, and then tears those beliefs down by introducing scientific explanations to our understanding of Vampires and our role in society.  Why does garlic repulse Vampires?  Why is blood important to Vampires?  What is the significance of the cross?  By examining these questions, and other things, Matheson makes these \\"monsters\\" much more human and sympathetic, leaving us wondering: Who are the monsters and who are the victims?<br /><br />The ending is superb and shocking.  What a terrific book.<br />.<br />As a bonus, the book has 10 additional short stories that are well worth reading.  I had to laugh when I read \\"Prey\\" because I had no idea that the horrible \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" film staring Karen Black was based on his story.  Horrible film but good story.
B00FEJIVRQ|5|This one is as good as the first. The second Iron Man was good but fell just a touch flat. This installment is just as fast paced and exciting as the first one.
B008RA3X5E|5|Wonderful app, many choices to customise to your own preferences. Love the weather feature too. One of my favorite apps!
B005NFJAZS|5|How could anyone not love this movie.  Makes you want to get up and march around the room.  Love it.
B002R88G4U|5|My only problem with this book was that it ended. Good times and lots of witty episodes, but in the backdrop of a World War just ended. Quirky and amusing characters, but still managing to be real and evoking empathy. Lovely read.
B003DBOS7Y|5|Best movie ever! A real tear jerker!
B009IF8CH6|5|Some of the funniest scenes yet.  One of the better seasons.  A definite must<br />or the Big Bang collector A1
B007IXWL2C|5|I've read this trilogy twice and loved it both times. Although the sex scenes were REALLY HOT, the story wasn't all about sex. I loved it because it describes what unconditionally love really is. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0054JZC6E|5|it is a great game and it does not take up that much space on your electronic. you can play whatever you want as long as you can and there all right there.
B001UN1KVE|5|So I've loved every Mel Brooks movie since I was young. Spaceballs was the 2nd movie I seen (Young Frankenstein was the first). When it's on tv I try to catch it and I been wanting a DVD copy for a long time but the price just seemed too much for the quality. Well this comes along, a bluray/dvd combo pack for less than $9! So I hopped on it. And from when I put it in the bluray to the end of the movie I couldn't stop laughing. The quality of the movie is much above an upscale and the audio is more than acceptable. For $9, get it. Mel Brooks deserves the money.
B001TH8UUA|5|Just what I expected.  The order was promptly taken to my hotel.  Very happy with purchase.
B0084IHVGG|5|This movie is precious, especially if you love cats!<br />My hubby hadn't seen it, but I had, so I bought it and we watched it together. We both own a Siamese cat.<br />We loved it! Super cute movie. We are in our late 20's early 30's. And we enjoy good clean movies. Great price. And we are cat lovers, oh and did I mention, I love Paris, and French things, so this fit all of that.
B000RMQH30|5|This was a present to one of our children and it was probably something that they had requested for Christmas.
B00006AW63|2|I like this movie, but did not notice that this was a region 2 DVD; MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT REGION!
B00CH87HF4|5|Great action based game and free also<br />Takes some time to get strong but replying levels is still fun second time around<br />Not a fan of spending real money for items, gems should be easy to obtain but it is not
B00BAVCD8A|4|Fall Out Boy - Save Rock And Roll<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />After announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2009, Illinois rockers Fall Out Boy make a triumphant return in 2013 with the release of their new album Save Rock And Roll.<br /><br />Over the past few years the band members have been exploring side projects they felt they could not do while Fall Out Boy was active. Singer and guitarist Patrick Stump released a solo album, Soul Punk in 2011, drummer Andy Hurley and guitarist Joe Trohman formed the metal group The Damned Things with Scott Ian of Anthrax fame, while Bassist and chief songwriter Pete Wentz teamed with singer Bebe Rexha to form the ska/electro pop band The Black Cards.<br /><br />With all of that out of their systems, the lads returned to Fall Out Boy with a sense of revitalisation and freshness. Save Rock and Roll has all the hallmarks that make Fall Out Boy a multiple MTV Video Music Award winner.<br /><br />The opening track The Phoenix is a big bold smack in the mouth, which signals the bands intentions, followed by the first single My Songs Know What Did In The Dark (Light 'em Up) which keeps the foot on the throat. Alone Together, Where Did The Party Go? and Death Valley showcase the band's ability to write a seriously catchy tune that won't escape your head and gets the toes tapping - this record will make you want to get up and move. A number of guest performers appear throughout the album, which includes American rapper Big Sean, Courtney Love, Foxes and Sir Elton John on the title track Save Rock And Roll.<br /><br />The album was produced by Butch Walker who has produced albums for the likes of Avril Lavgine, Simple Plan, Sevendust, Default and Taylor Swift among others. This is his second time producing for the band, having previously worked on their commercial success Infinity On High release, and the results are stunning. The sound is ambitious, polished and big...very, very big.<br /><br />Save Rock And Roll blurs the line between pop, rock, mainstream and punk but is one hell of a ride, one you'll want to take again and again.between pop, rock, mainstream and punk but is one hell of a ride, one you'll want to take again and again.

B0050DIWFC|4|Good read!
B00EL8I8IS|3|It is like all the other Zombie movies
B0015DROBO|3|This book did not live up to the hype. Parts of the story were hard to follow, but overall, not too bad.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Love everything about it! Impatiently waiting for season 6, it's final season.
B009KS4XRO|4|I like this game very much. I play it everyday, mostly to wind down. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's close to impossible to get all the pieces.
B0047Y0FGY|5|The only thing wrong with this book is that it wasn't long enough! I've seen Tina Fey on SNL since she first read the news and bantred with Jimmy Fallon, and learned from my brother that she was also a writer. Added all together, she is responsible for several months of solid laughter (day and night) and this book increased that amount by almost 2 hours.<br />What can I say? I'm a fast reader!<br />I learned the cause of Tina's scar, and the reasons she can laugh at life. She admitted to having some of the same problems I've had. We may not have chosen to solve them the same way, but I couldn't enjoy reading about her way and her life any more than I did this afternoon.<br />The thing Tina has to remember is that she's still a young woman, regardless of a few of the pictures she paints of herself. Since the average lifespan for women is past 70, she has another 30 years or so to live.  (I'm going by Tina's age at the time the book was written.)<br />If your first book is this much fun. Tina, you have to keep writing for us. Please....
0307341550|4|Because I loved \\"Gone Girl\\" and yet was not that enamoured of \\"Dark Places\\" I had been putting off getting around to Gillian Flynn's debut novel - so thank you to Erin Kelly for giving me the push... (Purchased in the UK)<br /><br />Camille Preaker returns to her hometown on behalf of the newspaper she works for,  to cover the murder of one child and the disappearance of another. As she becomes embedded once more into the places of her childhood some dark truths begin to emerge...<br /><br />I really am in two minds about this one - there is no doubt whatsoever that it is brilliantly written - and its not often that you get a single novel that has so many perfectly drawn, haunted characters. And I would imagine that critics (by critics I mean those people that are paid to read and review novels for some kind of media outlet) loved it for the most part. I loved it for the most part....<br /><br />Certainly it was compelling - the subject matter was terrifying, fascinating and complex and Ms Flynn creates a shadowy atmosphere that gives you a feeling of uneasiness throughout. The way she uses a sense of place to put you right in the story is dazzling - here we have a most terrific writer indeed.<br /><br />So you would think I would be putting this on my list of top reads. And yet, no, not quite. Whilst the matter of mental illness was obviously well researched and gave the whole story a depth that a standard mystery thriller would have lacked, I felt in places it was overdone. Thats not to say its not accurate - I would imagine without any actual medical knowledge that it is - but it seemed as if everyone who lived in that place suffered some form of it. There was not, as far as I found, a single character who was in any way normal, with the possible exception of the town's Police Chief, a man we find out very little about. For me this made it less authentic than it could have been - and sometimes removed me from the tale. I think you need some yin and yang personally....<br /><br />Still, its a 4* review for me because despite having said all that I cannot fault the writing or the flow. And the resolution will surprise the majority of readers I would imagine. The fact that I knew exactly where it was going quite early on is neither here nor there when it comes to my recommendation. If you love a great story, with an intriguing mystery and prefer that they are brilliantly written without cliche then you will love this. And you will never look at teeth in the same way again...<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!y....<br /><br />Still, its a 4* review for me because despite having said all that I cannot fault the writing or the flow.

B000F0UUT6|3|Enough has been written about the content. It's excellent. I previously viewed and was pleased with the transfer quality of the 4x3 release. I purchased this new set with high expectations and was very disappointed to find that the transfer to 16x9 looked like it was done from a video tape. The resolution is poor and the color looks washed out, sort of like one of those color enhanced black and white films without the cartoonish splashes of color.
B008MG1E4A|4|I preordered this book with much anticipation and burned through it as soon as it arrived.  Compared to other SEAL-themed books (Lone Survivor, Fearless, Service, SEAL Target Geronimo, etc.), I found it to have more humor (dry) and in my opinion it did not reveal anything that seemed like classified information (admittedly I am not an expert).  The author's account of the raid itself was captivating and the \\"business as usual\\" demeanor of these professionals is highly admirable.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the raid, DEVGRU or a glimpse into the comical \\"banter\\" that flows between these operators, even amid incredibly stressful scenarios.  If you're looking for classified tactical information or controversy, this book will probably disappoint you.  It's an easy to read, enjoyable, well-told story from the perspective one of the brave men involved.  I just hope he had the legal right to write it.
0440234743|4|I have a habit of buying Grisham novels as soon as they come out in paper back.  I let this one age a few years because I had reached the saturation point of reading Grisham.  This one was all the more pleasant to read after an extended dry spell.<br />Testament tells the story of the disposal of Troy Phelan's billions.  His children have been circling like sharks waiting for the blessed day when Troy expires,which he manages to orchestrate with dramatic flair.  Troy laughs from his grave watching lawyers predictably labor to carve themselves bigger pieces of the Phelan pie.  Much to the surprise of children and lawyers Troy leaves his entire estate to unknown illegitimate daughter Rachel Lane, who works as a missionary to native tribes in the Pantanal district of Brazil.<br />Recently rehabbed Lawyer Nate O'Riley is sent to locate Rachel and read her the will.  This trip brings a metamorphic experience to the  lawyer.  Nate finds Rachel to be a person of such simple integrity with her belief in a higher being that he longs for the same.<br />While I do not rate this as high as some of Grisham others,  I found it to be an extremely enjoyable book.  I particularly enjoyed the story of Nate's journey to Brazil.
B00ADW4I9O|5|Got this for my husbands birthday ... he loves it! Has more tracks than the one he purchased years ago.<br />Great quality and sound. Came very quick as I ordered it at last minute... thanks again amazon.
B008RA3X5E|4|Works well but not used very often. I worry that battery may die during the nite if i<br />am not careful to check charge.<br /><br />.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Terrific! I couldn't put it down.
B004TTMYQG|5|Works well, syncs with Gmail calendar smoothly. This is an app, I'm willing to pay for. Adding new events is easy and smooth.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Very cool!
B00P9TTSK0|1|Could not play. Went to title screen then died.
B00JAC25FM|5|Really like this game. It's a game that you can actually win without racking your brain and having to continue doing the same level over and over again.
B000K7UG34|5|This was a gift for my boyfriend's birthday, and he absolutely loved it! It was in great shape, and it shipped extremely quickly.  I was very pleased.
1451695195|5|What a wonderful journey that brings hope to those on this human journey.
1463524242|2|I bought this thinking it would be like all the other versions of this old text. Nope. It looks like they scanned it using a poor scanner, and they also omitted Keynes' own footnotes. Don't buy this version.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Lots of fun to play! The graphics and the music make it even more  fun to play...it's pretty easy to play but gets more challenging as you reach higher levels.
6305013578|1|Unwatchable quality.  Mutilaton of a great film
B00BMT9C84|4|Very funy!
B0000AQVCL|3|It is true- Jet blatantly rip off AC/DC, Nazareth, Iggy Pop, the Stones, etc.  They aren't original, they aren't subtle, and I think they set a record for the number of times &quot;yeah!&quot;, &quot;alright!&quot;, and &quot;whoo!&quot; is said on a single album.  That being said, this is still a good rock album.  Turn it up, roll down the windows, and hit the road.  And I disagree that they should be compared to the White Stripes or Strokes.  They remind me more of the Black Crowes in that they wear their influences on their sleeves but still put out some great rock.  Are they the flavor of the month?  Sure.  Will they be on &quot;classic rock&quot; stations as soon as they are pulled off the &quot;new rock&quot; stations?  Sure.  As long as they stay away from the average-at-best ballads, they're alright in my book.
B006LSZECO|5|Loved this book!
B00G21XNKU|5|SO glad to see David Tennant and Billie Piper again :) Lots of fun, and true to the newest incarnation of the Oncoming Storm.
B000WCDI5K|2|The only band I can think of that actually pulled off a really good b-sides album from beginning to end after releasing only two albums was The Smashing Pumpkins. Even great bands like Nirvana tried doing this as well but the outcome was inconsistent from what I can remember. The Killers needed to wait for another two or three albums before releasing a b-sides album. There is a few good tracks but it would have been better to wait for another couple of albums at least before releasing this so they could have a better selection of b-sides. I recommend downloading Where the white boys dance and Mr. Brightside remix.
B007SZ0E1K|5|Speedy. This thing chews through all my applications and games. Had it for a couple of weeks and no regrets. Worth the price.
B00K2QKM3C|5|Grand daughter loves the story.
B0089LOG02|5|very well written and interesting
B0000AQS0F|5|I took a bit of a risk buying this set.  I'd never seen a single episode, but read the super positive reviews on Amazon and figured I couldn't not like it.  While it took a few episodes to kick in, Firefly proved to be a very unique, original and wonderful series! <br /> <br />Typical of any Joss Whedon show (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel), Firefly is filled with humorous and witty dialogue, well thought-out and deep characters, and a plethora of secrets within the episodic plot.  Underlying the entire show is a very original and interesting mix of a futuristic world with the familiar elements of the \\"wild west\\".  There's one scene with a gang of henchmen riding through the desert on horseback  while the rich man rides on a slick hovercraft!   <br /> <br />The only drawback of this show is the fact that it's incomplete due to the fact that it was cancelled mid-season!  Such a shame, because there's so much potential for it to blossom into a REALLY GOOD SHOW!  So much was left unanswered.  Why is River wanted so badly by the authorities?  What's gonna happen between Malcolm and Inara?  What's gonna happen with Simon and Kaylee?  What is Shepherd Book all about? <br /> <br />Hopefully, some of those questions will be answered in the upcoming film version of the show, called Serenity.  But if you're a sci-fi fan, Buffy fan, Joss fan, or just a fan of great TV shows, I highly recommend you check out Firefly.  It's truly one of the best shows I've ever seen.
B006UKFFE0|5|Pretty much all of the Lean Startup proponents will tell you that what you want is to be \\"lean,\\" as in, minimal, efficient, etc, not \\"Lean,\\" as in \\"some consultant came to my company and ran through his checklist.\\" That said, it's extremely helpful to have Ash's take on running a lean company. Whether you take his steps or leave them, after you read the book you'll end up with both practical examples of how to run various stages of your learning, *and* a much better understanding of what the principles other authors try to convey. Must Read, even if you don't put everything into practice.
B0063IH60K|4|I love this game when I'm bored.  it's a great game on the kindle fire.  I have not had any problems with it at all.
B003EI2EH2|1|Timothy Ferris clearly thinks quite highly of himself and doesn't hesitate to let you know how superior he is to you in every way in this incredibly long (592 pages) doorstop of a book. In it he professes to have the solution to many of your health woes and promises to help you accomplish such things as \\"Sleep 2 hours per day and perform better than on 8 hours.\\" (I'll spare you the pain of reading his incredibly scientific and boring explanation by telling you that this requires an unbelievably complicated schedule of sleeping a few minutes at a time all day long. If you're blessed by the type of lifestyle where you don't have to work or interact with other human beings in any way, this might work for you).<br />Ferris' idea of a healthy life is chock full of supplements and expensive testing. He subjects himself to a myriad of experiments and has found success in his trials, but any adult with an actual job and family obligations could never afford the pills and gadgets he touts as lifesavers. I am thankful that I got this book from the library and didn't waste the $26.95 it costs to buy the book.<br />Besides being incredibly scientific and difficult to read, Ferris is simply too cocky and stuck on himself to gain my trust.
B007SGLZP8|4|The story had good twists, and the ending was a good surprise.  Could not tell whether the hero was a good guy or a bad guy.
B007DIQC90|5|This CD is really great, a different sound than I've heard for a long time. It has some great themes and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys alternative music
1878424319|5|The Four Agreements has changed my life in a good way. I live a tranquil life, I don't have anxiety anymore and I look at life in a positive way. Please read this book.
B00002N9ER|5|I love these things for keeping my 3D LED Maglite mounted in my work truck. Has a very firm grip on the light preventing any sliding/rattling when going down the road while keeping my light within reach whenever needed. The included screws have held their grip for months now in the plastic panel I have these mounted on through many deployments/insertions of the light. If you want to mount your D cell light somewhere, this is the way to do it. Plain and simple. It works.
B00HQI823Q|1|You would of thought that with all the technology of today they could have re-released this 2 DVD set in the same correct order as the 2 video tape collection series but NO.... they again had to mess it up and so that it is once again completely different from the audio CD version.<br /><br />If you want to see the &#34;so called&#34; extra live tracks you have to put on Disc 2 of the DVD and then it only plays 1 track at a time!!!<br /><br />As for the Audio CD why have they never put on Sinead O'Conner's &#34;War&#34; and rather than having Eric Clapton play the same song twice. Why not have Sinead's &#34;War&#34; or Nancy Griffith's  Boots Of Spanish Leather. It's not as if there wasn't the space on the disc for it.<br /><br />Another botched up  re - release from a record company  that has no value in Authenticity As I stated in the heading better off recording this from VCR to DVD recorder just to get the complete show in it's entire correct order. Wasted effort
6305736650|5|'Casablanca' is the greatest movie ever filmed. It has no &quot;action&quot; to speak of, no special effects, and it doesn't offend the senses. What it DOES have is spectacular acting, a great story, and an astoundingly good script -- all the more incredible considering this is one film of hundreds that Hollywood churned out in the wartime and post-war 1940's. If you don't like black-and-white movies -- then just close your eyes and listen to it. It's worth the money.
B001ILFUDM|1|The case inside was cracked
B0050PYNP8|4|We loved this movie.
B000007SPU|5|The second in the series of \\"This Mortal Coil\\"is much longer and Dominic Appleton of \\"Breathless\\"another unique band worth checking out, has offered up his vocal skills along with Alison Limeric, a vibrant wonderful singer,as well as the sisters Diedre and Loise Rutowski who`s  harmonies rival the wilson sisters of the band \\"Heart\\".The first song \\"The Jewler\\" sung by Appleton is a sweet melancholy story and there are also some other storyteller type songs.\\"My father\\" a Judy Collins song, Covered by Alison Limeric is extremly well done and as beautiful as songs get. Limerics voice sores to great hights and plumets to low visa versa,versa visa.I often have to repeat it because one listen is`nt enough.\\"The strength of Strings\\" is a rather unique song but is a treat to hear and I must say at first I didn`t know it was Appleton on the vocal because I had never heard him sing in the range he`s using, meanwhile instrumental soundscapes run through it connecting it all together,same as the first but more experimental, dramitic and complicated venturing toward the tribal beat.If you liked the first then you will like this. If you are not familiar with any of them, but enjoy ecletic music then this is for you too.It`s one of those cd`s that you can put on whilst enjoying  a quite evening to your selfe.Enjoy
B0007939NO|5|Great gift for a family friend.
B00BOL22GY|5|<REVISED> This show really sucked me in.  I was on the fence after first episode but so glad I kept going.  There are some AMAZINGLY good episodes about 2/3 of the way through.  The performances are made really mesmerizing by the weird accents, cadences and sentence structures. Lead actor has a wicked screen presence - meaning very good - even though it turns out he doesn't have much range, and those blue contacts...But still totally watchable - cannot wait for season 2 - might even pay for it if I can't wait a year.<br />Too early to decide - will try another episode.  Show could easily go either way (good or ridiculous).  First episode a few cliched moments.
B000KUD2G4|5|It worked as advertised. Frequency response is adequate and the hum was eliminated. Nice package/form factor as well. Buy it.
072325804X|5|Her illustrations are so wonderful and everything about her books brings a gentle world into the childs life. Loved giving her books.
B000N6TYLW|5|This season of Gilmore Girls tied up a lot of loose ends, which definitely makes sense considering that it was the last season.  It was also probably one of my favorite seasons, even though the season finale, also being the series finale, was very emotional and sad.  A definite buy for any Gilmore Girls lover. <3
B00821OX98|5|A good action show
B00R3DOCJM|5|Gave has a gift
0385535139|5|Another winner from John Grisham.  I love his stories about lawyers.  I can't wait for each new book he writes.
B00006M183|5|Some great music has been released in 2002 (e.g. Elvis Costello's \\"When I Was Cruel\\" and Sonic Youth's \\"Murray Street\\"). You can place \\"Riot Act\\" up near the top of that list. This is stripped down rock at its best that is neither a return to form nor a new direction for Pearl Jam. What it really is, is another great release in a long line of great rock and roll music from a great rock and roll band. The disc gets stronger and stronger with each listen.  There really are no weak tracks. So far, track 2 \\"Save You\\" is the stand out cut from the record.  However, some of the best tunes can be found on the second half, such as track 8 \\"You Are\\" and track 10 \\"Green Disease\\". Good stuff.  <br />As far as individual performances go, Eddie Vedder's vocals are predicatably top notch. Yes, he is a little more subdued than what you may be used to, but he's no less powerful.  I think this restraint really adds to the overall feel of the music.  He has such a unique voice that it still sounds fresh after all these years. Also, there are some rippin' guitar solos peppered throughout the album. Production is crisp.<br />The world of music has many uncertainties, but one thing's for sure, a Pearl Jam record is sure to please.
B000VBJEEG|5|Pixar has proven over and over again that they know how to tell a story, and they know how to animate, and that they can do both at the same time.  Ratatouille is no different in that regard, though as you might expect a company that holds themselves to such a high standard, they are getting better.  This movie is my favorite animated motion picture of all time.<br /><br />The story is that of an immigrant community.  In this case, rats.  In the process of the story we are never asked to make the correlation between how immigrants have been (and sometimes are) treated, but the similarity is there nonetheless.  We are forced to look at our assumptions and thanks to the wonders of humor, laugh them away.  Most will walk away from the movie having enjoyed themselves and thinking nothing of the meaning.  And that's okay, because it's a movie made to entertain, not persuade.  But having said that, I encourage you to watch this with a critical eye and realize that this wonderfully charming cartoon has a lot to say.
B0002Y4T92|5|This is a remarkable set of DVD's, for sure!  Any show sponsored by the World's preeminent guitarist, Eric Clapton, is sure to be excellent!  But, this show had unrealistic expectations of being entirely presented on this two-pack DVD set, I think.  There were just too many quality artists involved to permit each of them to be adequately accomandated on this set.  I believe that there will be much more yet to be seen! The \\"plum\\" of the festival was certainly the one song that Jeff Beck performed with Clapton, and it was mysteriously deleted from this set dramatically just days before it went into production, (if the media is to be believed).  A second set featuring this performance, along with a good helping of Buddy Guy's set, is certainly yet to come!  Actually, there is enough of the best stuff omitted in this set to allow for a second \\"Crossroads\\" release to be the better of the two!!<br /><br />  I think that Clapton did a good job in all his participation, (at least in what is on these two DVD's), with the one exception of not giving more time to Vince Gill.  Gill is the best guitarist in country music, and I had hoped that he would have been able to really exhibit his playing skills at this guitar-oriented event.  Usually, he has to focus on his vocals, that is what made him such a huge figure in his genre, but at the expense of his playing time on stage.  His guitar-work is incredible, when he has time to display it.  I had even thought he might have played some more rock-oriented selections, just to show what he can do!<br /><br />  The single best song presented on this set is the one solo number by Robert Cray.  It really stands out among the selections on the second DVD.  ZZ Top was a good choice to end the DVD, but they butcher the lyrics, though the two songs were well chosen.  Where were Tommy Shaw, & Styx?  I heard they were awesome at this festival!  The young guys were able to reach a different audience, I think.  I was particularly impressed by Jonny Lang, who sings as well as he plays.  Vai's performance was well-planned, and Mayer was an interesting addition.  But, what was James Taylor doing there?<br /><br />  This entire festival needs to be released!!  Or, at least much more of it!ang, who sings as well as he plays.  Vai's performance was well-planned, and Mayer was an interesting addition.  But, what was James Taylor doing there? <br />    This entire festival needs to be released!!

B000FC10MU|4|Good book. Refreshing storyline.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Couldn't put it down. Perfect for a quick read on vacation or long car ride. Riveted the entire book. Enjoy!
B00H4M3GXK|5|Cute movie.
B002ZG9846|5|I'll keep this short.  This movie is full of action, has some great laughs and kept me entertained throughout.  If you need to forget the crazy day you had at work and wind down, fix some popcorn and pop this title into your player.  You'll be in a much better mood when it's over.
B00CO5AQ12|5|I highly recommend this stuff! I bought two 2.2 pound boxes, one for my daughter and grandchildren and one for an art therapist friend. My daughter, grandchildren and the kids at the school where my friend works all absolutely loved it.  It is so incredible and relaxing to play with.  I am even planning on buying more for my holistic healing practice!
B00GJNQ40W|5|I am a great collector of Lucinda Williams. This new issued special edition has also a second CD with a LIVE concert<br />fro Holland - for a Lucinda collector a must!!!
B00005JPGO|5|I saw this movie when it was released in December 06 and was blown away. Dicaprio was spectacular with his South African accent and Djimon Honsou should have gone to the Academy Awards. When I saw it I expected that it would be just another action film but it far exceded my expectation. My only complaint is that the dvd has not enough making of features. Instead it is over crowded with a documentary about diamonds. Still a great movie. I know good and this film is good!
B008CLI4N4|5|Love the story. Have to admit I needed to watch it twice, then read the story, and watched them again. I've gotten my husband hooked on the story too.
B00I3ULXBY|5|It is amazing! i love how the back is crystal clear and shows the perforated phone back. Its very slim and doesnt add much bulk to the phone :)
B00KW23WOC|3|Fast paced well made action flick.
B000093BDX|5|Very pleased with purchase
B00H58VGIA|4|This is a great book. It offers the reader insights to pre-emancipation life in Charleston and more specifically of Sarah Grimke's evolution and contribution to end slavery. Weaving in Hetty and the other household slaves helps us to realize what slaves endured and.brings an even more personal touch to the novel. The writing style, detail, and story-line kept me interested for the entire book.
B0052UZIFA|5|Excellent graphics and runs great on droid2. The file is pretty big, but have not noticed any slowdowns or freezes, at all. One of my favorite games, so glad that popcap now made it for android. Worth the money, imo.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is an awesome game. I love it more and more every time I play it. I play this more than I play anything. I got my mom,brother,and nephew playing this game. It gets addictive, I really believe that. So I hope this shows how much I love this game!!!!!!!!!!
B009SJ47XA|5|I have been anxiously waiting the release of Season 2 of American Horror Story, my only reservation was that they could not compete with [[ASIN:B005SZADQS Murder House: Pilot [HD]]] fantastic character selection.<br /><br />I am glad to say that Asylum had met and bypassed Murder House in character quality and depth. [[ASIN:B009SJ47XA Welcome to Briarcliff [HD]]] introduced a huge selection of characters that I am eager to learn more about. This episode alone convinced me to buy the whole season.
B00DXLO0D6|5|I've read most of the reviews on this product. It appears all of the major issues with this product have been corrected. All of the DVD's are now stored in a container that holds all of the DVD's firmly and safely. The picture and sound quality on all of the episodes is outstanding. The picture and sound quality on the episodes originally filmed in black and white, but colorized for DVD release are outstanding, too. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the DVD's that I've watched. I've watched every episode of the first 3 seasons and I'm halfway through the fourth season, so, I believe, the entire set is an outstanding value. The show is more fun to watch now than it was originally in the 1960's. I highly recommend it to everyone. It's worth every bit of my 5 Star rating  and I hope this DVD Box Set will bring you and your family closer together.
B00GIXWXEO|2|Terrible movie. I only gave it two stars because we finished it, barely. There are much better movies for rent.<br /><br />For comparison, off the top of my head, of the movies available at Amazon Instant Video, here are movies that both my children and I always (or almost always enjoy):<br /><br />Tangled; Incredibles; Finding Nemo; Monsters, Inc.; Despicable Me; Toy Story; Toy Story II, Toy Story III; Shrek; Megamind; Kung Fu Panda; Ice Age: The Meltdown; Bee Movie; Tarzan; Enchanted; Cars<br /><br />Here are the movies that my children enjoy, and I sometimes enjoy:<br /><br />Bolt; Meet the Robinsons, Monsters U; Brave; Shrek 2; Shrek 3; How to Train Your Dragon; Rio; Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs; Madagascar; Madagascar 2; Mulan; Pocahontas; Bug's Life; Lilo & Stitch; Hunchback of Notre Dame<br /><br />Here are movies that are great, but both my children and I must be in a certain mood to watch:<br /><br />Wall-E; Up; Ratatouille; Robin Hood; Sword in the Stone; Alice in Wonderland; Most of the older Disney movies<br /><br />Movies that don't make the cut, which means we only watch them if we're desperate and my children lose interest fast:<br /><br />Turbo; Planes, Emperor's New Grove (though Kronk is very funny); Cars 2; Madagascar 3; Hercules
B0051ANPZQ|5|Loved it because it combined happy and sad. Also it makes you raise that you should be grateful for all you have and that you don't have to go through all the troubles little August had to go through.
B009UX2YAC|5|Love this game!  One of the best game I have played so far!  I'm not a person who plays games but I find myself picking up my kindle on almost all of my spare time!
B00CWY76CC|5|Can,t wait for more.  It was a little quick but I really enjoyed it. There were a couple times I was challenged but found my way out.
B00EKR61FM|5|I told my daughter I didn't like vampire movies and it took her over a year to convince me to give it a try. So one day I'm watching TV and #2 and 3 were playing, so I DVR'd them and watched them. Well, of course I had to watch #1, so I bought it, then I was hooked. Went on Amazon and bought the whole set. I've had it for 3 months now and have watched the entire set over a dozen times. I LOVE THE TWILIGHT SAGA!!!!!
1476746583|5|One of t he best books I have read in many a day and worthy of its Pulitzer Prize!
B00FJ2YTLK|4|It was enjoyable to as were the first two books. I will admit that there were some times where I did get a bit bored, but the ending was absolutely splendid. Maxon and America are by far my one of my favorite fictional characters
B0058S0OMS|5|The first Halloween is a must see in order to understand and appreciate this film.  The first film sets this film up beautifully, even though it was not meant to...I have watched both of these films numerous times and still love them.  This sequel does what every sequel should do...add a little more to the history/background without fleshing out the aggressor to the point of total understanding.  The pace is just right and there is not the over kill of blood and guts.  There is not as much suspense in this movie as the first film, but I do not believe it was meant to have it.  Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers perfectly.  Everything has been said already about the late Donald Pleasence role in the film, one word - \\"AWESOME\\".   This film is definite \\"must have\\" for the Halloween series fan, and it is a great addition to the franchise.  I am glad it will be coming to Blu-ray, as others have stated in these reviews...I have been wanting a better/updated copy since my $5.00 copy I bought \\"back in the day\\" from a used dvd store.  The music in this sequel is updated some from the first film but is still excellent and gives the eeriness of know that something is going to happen, you just not sure exactly when...  All in all, a great horror sequel which helped the series move along and set the pathway for parts 4 and 5, and gives some closure to the first film.  Hopefully in the near future Halloween 4 & 5 will get the same Blu-ray treatment...
B00J1IQUYM|4|Interesting story that captures your attention quickly. Characters are believable and animated. I enjoyed the storyline and it held my interest to the end.
B003FZ9AR6|5|Great storytelling.
0451196716|3|In some weird dystopian future 100 teenage boys volunteer to walk a death march across America in search of the \\"Ultimate Prize\\" for the sole survivor - you see, if you can't walk anymore, you're shot. Thus begins an epic 200+ mile walk in which the endurance of the human body and spirit is pushed to its limits.<br /><br />King does a good job of keeping the story moving despite not much variation in what's happening over nearly 300 pages: they walk, someone falls, is shot, they walk, someone falls, is shot, etc, repeat. The cast of characters is built up and then brought down. We slowly see the characters start to crack up psychologically and then physically, then turn on one another. It's fascinating for a while.<br /><br />King also doesn't give much away about the world this takes place in - it's recogisable except there is talk of a \\"Change\\", of \\"Squads\\", and the mysterious \\"Major\\" who runs the annual (!) Long Walk. The Walk is spectator sport at its bloodiest.<br />We are also kept guessing as to the reward for the winner - a prize is mentioned but walkers talk about how they just shoot the winner instead. The ending is masterfully written to keep the reader guessing as to what really happened.<br /><br />But even if this is one of King's shortest (by his standards), I still think the book was overlong.  It's an interesting story that gets a bit long in the tooth due to the slow depletion of the 100 boys and could've been as effective at half the length.<br /><br />Despite the feeling that it dragged a bit for me, I was definitely impressed with the way King portrayed psychological disintegration so well, as well as the subtletly in which he kept the boys' motives for taking part in the race somewhat ambiguous (\\"volunteer\\" is a term used loosely as you find out - or is it? Are they all mad or not?). One of King's most interesting works and better than some of his more well known books, a definite book to check out if you're a fan or would like to read King without the supernatural horror he's famous for.s famous for.
B000HIVQD0|5|After I caught the Pretenders at the House of Blues in Cleveland, I immediately went out to purchase the CDs which I had lost sometime ago to a love interest in college.  These are absolutely the best CD re-releases that I have ever owned ! The CDs cases are not plastic, but small fold out booklets with an additional remove-able booklet for lyrics and liner notes tucked inside.   Plus the demo tracks are AMAZING !!! I actually prefer Chrissie's vocals on some of the demos much better than they actually came through on the final mixes.   I bought all three of the CDs (Pretenders 1, Pretenders 2, and Learning to Crawl) for about $50. All have demos and previously unreleased material. It was the best $50 I had spent on music in quite a long time.   Great band. She is the pride of Akron and Northeast Ohio.

B00D7OMNXS|5|Thank you!  I ordered this for my young son and two days(regular shipping) later it was at my door.  The blue ray was new as promised and I did'nt have to go out in this cold Chicago winter.
B00BFUUMO8|5|If you like the movies this is a good download. Easy to learn and fun to play. Worth at least trying!
B003M70O5O|5|All consuming
B00915G6MG|5|This is  great series, my alltime favorite. No problems with the order. Too bad that Ziva left. Also, they made a big mistake in killing Mike Franks.
B00NEJ7MMI|4|Beautiful voices blended in harmony so well.  I only gave it 4/5 stars because of some of the selections that I didn't think showed their voices to capacity, but there are several that I could listen to over and over. I also enjoy watching this group sing. Watch them on U-tube, it enhances listening later.
0142403873|5|After watching the short movie inspired on this book we had to get it for my daugther. We just love it! very nice ilustrations and rhymes.
0671891634|1|Recently, Fidelity Investments announced that they would unilaterally increase all employee 401(k) contributions about to 7% of their pay checks and move all their current and future contributions to Fidelity Freedom Funds, which are managed funds with high management fees.  Employees, who wish to opt out can't do so until July 29, 2014.  The wise passive investor knows you should always opt for INDEXED funds with LOW management fees over MANAGED funds with their HIGH management fees.  This is just the Fidelity way of making even more money for their already overpaid and under-performing executives.<br /><br />I am ashamed to work here and will leave as soon as I find a position with a comparable compensation package.
B00AIQP9DE|4|I really like the style of this game. The fast pace can make it very easy to miss areas, unless the full version allows you to move throughout the map.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Compelling story .
B00IURL19Y|5|This Blu-Ray TV box set arrived on time and intact, with no sign of damage to either the discs or both the case and outer slip cover. Picture, sound and features playback is superb. I would recommend this Blu-Ray box set to anyone who purchases it online from amazon.com.
B000MD9UJC|5|Highly recommend this upgrade to others.  Easy to install.  Just plain bright.
0374533571|5|Good
B0014JIFWG|4|I bout them for my son.  I thought they had air holes in them, but didn't have them.  He will have to wear socks.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Just like flappy bird! What's with the poop though? I like flappy bird and flappy wings they're both the same pretty much
B00AREIAI8|5|Ok at first I was confused on how to work the game but after a few minutes of is really really fun and I do mot regret getting this game.....if you love horses then you should get thks game
1616614609|5|Two words.  Try it.
B000000OAA|5|I first heard this on a used LP years ago but I'll spare you the history lesson. This is a fantastic collection of tunes where heavy metal and cabaret collide with Beatle-type song structures and - somehow - it all holds together perfectly. The musicianship is amazing and, perhaps because none of the songs here were played to death on the radio, virtually all of this CD sounds as fresh as it did years ago. Even if you're sick of the few Queen songs that are still in heavy radio rotation, you will find much to cheer about here. The production is sleek, the riffs are furious, and the harmonies are stellar. <br /> <br />Highlights? \\"Brighton Rock\\" is an incredible guitar workout (including multiple overdubbed guitar harmonies) but has enough signature and tempo changes to have done most prog bands proud. \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is speed metal years before anyone could imagine such a thing, with heavy fleet fingered riffs that owe nothing to blues rock. And then there's the pop perfection of \\"Killer Queen,\\" the alienated balladry of \\"Tenement Funster\\" and the operatic strangeness of \\"In the Lap of the Gods.\\" <br /> <br />
B00B4VI8MQ|3|Good game but slow moving. It is also a little hard to understand. It needs better directions. All in all, great to pass the time with. I would not pay for it though.
B00K77STQ8|5|Works great!  Screen size is really not an issue at all for me.  Easy to install.
B00DF0ZP8Y|4|Plastic was coming off of the cardboard backing but other than that it is a good buy.
B00BD99JMW|4|I loved all three books in the trilogy. This book did not end how I would have like and it left me hanging with a lot of questions. I would definitely recommend this book, but do not expect a happy ending.
B00127RAJY|5|This video is a great workout, and I am still on level 1.  Want to work up to level 3 w/n a month.  The workouts focus on cardio, strength, and abs so you can get a full body workout in a short amount of time.  I highly recommend this video.
B008JGSM6G|5|good relaxing paced game.  slowly increases in complexity but at a satisfying pace.  like a lot and just right for a puzzle game.
B003WUYRGI|5|This book was a wonderful book and I would rate it A+ .com school academics grading and a #1 best  Oxford dictionary of English
B002VRNR1Y|5|Horrifying. I've seen this movie at least ten times over the years and it always delivers a good scare...even with the lights on.
B00G4I1CLS|5|Intriguing story. I am not a big fan of zoos and even less of SeaWorld and the like.
B007ED9FIY|5|The intensity and emotions of George Clooney's character is so well acted that one forgets it is just that; acting.
B001706I5I|5|A X-mas tradition.  Love this movie.
B007MNV5WU|5|Very well designed and written. I couldn't leave the game and played for 3 hours straight.<br />I like the physics, changing gravity and types of birds.
0316044938|2|Just didn't care for the way this novel was written.  Saw the movie and thought it was good although it didn't follow the book and develop the characters the way they are developed in teh book.
B00HY7VU60|5|Loved the books, loved seeing them come to life in this series. Please Starz, start work on the White Princess!
B000FQIRXQ|5|what is there to say about Charles dickens? In  this Charles dickens the characters are the best .I really enjoyed this new verion.
0316666343|4|Susie Salmon tells her story from heaven after being raped an murdered. She describes how her family is coping with the terrible events that unfold from her murder and how life in heaven develops.<br />The book presents a well depicted vision of what heaven is like but the most important acomplishment is the unveiling of what a family goes through as a consequence of such horrible events.<br />The only flaw I can point is that there is a point in which the story moves forward in time very fast creating a gap that would have been better filled with a more thorough depiction of what was going on.<br />Overall a very good read, definitely worth your time!
B00GEEB730|5|Beautiful love story
B000XUBC5E|5|Excellent. ...loved the twist and turns. Encouraged me to buy another one of his books! Rarely do I not see it coming.
B00GIXWHZ4|5|The action was fast, the storyline and acting was quite believable.  It was a story of intrigue and greed with Wolverine playing a reluctant hero.  I enjoyed it very much!
B00MFDQ8DI|4|Thought the acting was very good and the performances were believable.  The story line was ok.  Had the lead bad person been killed as soon as the &#34;take-over&#34; program been purged from the computer, it would have been more realistic, but then there would not be the second and third movies in the series.
1582701709|1|Positive thinking is good, yes.  The universe, however, does not react to our thoughts.  Wishes don't come true by wishing hard enough.  There's really nothing left to say about it.  This is the tired speech you hear from motivational speakers, but with unfounded \\"historical facts\\" and unfounded \\"science\\" to back up its, frankly, supernatural claims.
B0073U2FB2|5|Strange but great shipped fast
B0013TTLDE|5|Was one of those books did not want to put down. Kept interest all the way through. Liked her writing and immediately ordered her next book.
B007SGM084|5|I'm not a book reader at all. I saw the author talking on 20/20 about this book, so I looked it up on my touchpad.  Ordered the first book just for giggles.  I couldn't put the touchpad down.  The story draws you in and keeps you wanting more.  I have completely neglected my house  I ended up buying the 2nd book and read it in 2 days.  Tried to wait a couple week on the 3rd. But couldn't resist .  Now I'm done and want more.  This book could really be used for marriage counselling  I have been with my husband for 25 years and he will be reading these books soon. Love love love
B0006L16N8|5|I've read a good number of the reviews and I've been listening to the album for nearly a week now and here is my take. I don't like to make comparisons to other albums in the first few days because I feel that is not fair to the record. You need to listen to it when you are happy, sad, with friends, alone, in hte car, home with headphones, drunk, sober or whatever. Just give it some time to soak in, then make your comparisons. I liked Parachutes, and loved Rush of Blood, so it will be interesting to see where this one lands. <br />   As far as the songs... yes, Speed of Sound does have a Clocks kind of feel. Yes, there are some samples of Kraftwerk and a few other bands, but those are an homage, people. I really do enjoy the ballads What if and Fix you. The songs I can't seem to get out of my head though are Talk and White Shadows. The hidden track is great, I'd love to hear more like it. I also enjoy S of S, Low, A Message, and Square One, and I do agree with alot of reviewers who think Hardest Part is the weakest. It is. Its the only one I am skipping past now. However, as far as the whole CD, if you a Coldplay fan, you'll love it. If not, give it a try. <br />   Now, about some of the other reviews. First, the guy who told each member of the band what they are doing right and wrong. Do you really think they give a rat's ass if you think the guitarist is weak? This is a CD review, not a bandmate review. If you like the band and the CD, great, if you don't, go form your own band or listen to something else.  <br />  Next, the guy who said this is emotionless is clueless. That's way off base. Everyone has been through splintered relationships, broken marraiges and lost loves. Some of these songs sing out what those emotions feel like, and many of us turn to music like this to help soothe the pain. This album definitely delivers in that category. If you can't feel it, you are emotionally devoid. <br />   Finally, for the hypocrits who say they love Coldplay, then complain when there isn't some overwhelming change from album to album. If ain't broke, why Fix it? If the sound is going to change, it will be gradual. Since alot of people like the U2 comparisons, lets go wtih that. U2 didn't reinvent themselves on every album. They had changes from one to the next, but you could always tell it was them. So what changes are you looking for? If Rush was great in most everyone's minds, then why would they even want to deviate? I personally think they are great. They've done some different things on this album, I don't feel it's a retread, and I look forward to the next in 3 years while I continue to cycle through the first three.
B001F290E4|4|This is a really good, easy listening album. Some of the songs were a little older than I was looking for, but his voice is great to listen to any time!!
B000001FZK|5|`Myrrhman' is gently hypnotic, apparently devoid of structure and impossibly delicate, the barely audible vocals only heightening the soothing, spacious nature of the music. `Ascension Day' is far more accessible, although that word barely functions in the context of this album. It draws the listener in slowly with its deceptively simple, chorus like turn at some points, yet descends into a carefully orchestrated inferno of intense noise, each instrument combining confidently to achieve a cacophonous overall effect. `After the Flood' the albums massive epic, incorporates touches of organ and a lengthy section of guitar feedback which is somehow more eloquent than a thousand solos.<br /><br />After the masterpiece 'Spirit of Eden' one had to wonder where Talk Talk could go. These songs illustrate the grand plan of Mark Hollis then, namely, his desire to fuse progressive touches with a pop-aesthetic with touches of jazz and free form experimentation to create something entirely without peer in the world of `rock', for want of a better word, music. `Laughing Stock' sees the band move further away from traditional song structures, musical ideas or conventional use of instruments. Hollise's genius is not his talent for taking a musical hook which can worm its way into your brain and never leave, and painting a jaw dropping aural tapestry around two or three such ideas out of which emerges a beast that, I suppose, I'd have to call a song. More, it is his ability to utilize the sound of a number of instruments, slotting them together in ways I'd never have thought possible, to produce an overall effect that is never short of stunning. One only has to listen to the driving percussion on `Ascension day' or `New Grass', then wonder at how the swathes of organ and harmonium, then the crescendos of harmonica, then the spiteful, dissonant points of guitar are fused on to a musical movement which seems to evolve like it is alive, rather than simply a band playing together.<br /><br />Despite all this, it is the fact that the music is as accessible as it undoubtedly is that assures this albums legendary status. There are no solos, no particularly long interludes, and certainly not a wasted second on the disc. Rather, the experimentation is in form, structure, voice, and the manner in which instrument combine, as I've mentioned. The song `Runeii' is of particular note, as it may be the only song I've heard to use space (yeah, silence) to drive its point home: somehow, despite the pleading, at times remarkably powerful vocals of Hollis, it is the tantalizing, carefully placed gaps in the flow which punctuate the song that lends it its sense of urgency, the sliding guitar lines only adding to this feeling. This, I believe, is the central focus of the album, and the apex of the bands vision: to use experimentation as a means of putting across a message in a new, original way, and hence heightening its power.<br /><br />This is a very important record. It has emotional depth and power rarely matched, and it progresses in the most profound way: no pretension, no wasted notes, no indulgence. Along with `Spirit of Eden' which is probably the place to start with this incarnation of the band, it reveals layers barely imagined, over time, and quickly becomes indispensable. I would urge anyone who reads this and feels they may like this sort of thing to please, please check this album out. Don't just take my word for it, repeat listens will unveil a masterpiece.te all this, it is the fact that the music is as accessible as it undoubtedly is that assures this albums legendary status.

B005LAIHY0|1|I promise you, I was entirely excited for this movie when the previews blared all over the theater screens and TV spots.  Yet what it delivered was an unenjoyable, stupid, absolutely frustrating waste of film.  There is no \\"thought provoking\\" mystery to the whole thing, it's just a badly written movie that does NOT deserve to be owned, let alone be a part of the wonderful, honestly well made Alien films.<br /><br />Answers, there are none.  Questions?  You'll have plenty, and not about \\"why are we here?\\" more along the lines of \\"Why go through all the trouble?\\"<br /><br />Rent the movie, perhaps, but be prepared for a disappointing, blah film.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Hooked!
0345544927|5|Enjoyed the book.
B0000C7PQK|4|there are some scraches on the cd , but it works perfect. i am satisfied.
0307341569|5|Libby Day was seven when her mother and two older sisters were murdered. Her brother, Ben, was thought to have done it. It was his voice she heard calling her name after she escaped out of the window that cold January night. She even testified against him in court. But did he? And if he didn't, why isn't he trying to appeal his prison sentence?<br /><br />It's twenty five years later. Money Libby had in a trust from donations over the years is running out. Mentally and emotionally, she can't handle a job. As a means to get some cash, she agrees to meet with a group of true crime fans called The Kill Club. They are willing to pay her for her time. Their goal is to set her brother free. They believe Libby might have some information to help. Up until now, she's believed her brother was the murderer. After the meeting, she wasn't so sure anymore. She and a member of the club, Lyle, work to uncover clues.<br /><br />To give the reader a multidimensional view of what happened, the story is told from Libby's point of view now, but that of her mother's, Patty Day, and Ben's with a surprise voice close to the end that will bring the story full circle. The way the story flips back and forth is so smooth, so real, and so chilling. This is a work of dark fiction that surpasses the author's previous book, SHARP OBJECTS. A must read for thriller fans.
0767817486|5|I purchased this for my mother and father, they had seen it several years ago, and wanted to watch it again, because a documentary was being aired about the young man in the movie.  They were thrilled to be able to view the movie anytime they want and the price was reasonable.
B00BJ9VBLI|5|This game is very entertaining and lots of fun. My only problem with it is that you have to pay for the update, that's how they hook you in. I don't like to be &quot;toyed&quot;with. Why not just charge me up front and let me make my own decision void of deception.
B004I11VZA|5|hi i think this sequel to the first ipman is just as good,very well told story and full of action just what you want
B00005ASHM|5|Simply put, \\"God Only Knows,\\" if you want to experience the genius that is Brian Wilson this album will show you that and a whole lot more.  AMAZING!!!!
B00GSZEBE2|1|Like a 3 year olds game. Deleted it after 6 hours. Don't bother downloading unless you are a child. Not entertaining unless you are a child.
B003G94BZC|4|Matt Smith enters the picture. It takes some time to get used to the new Doctor.  Other than a few outlyer episodes, this season was GREAT!
B004DLPXAO|1|If you have an older Android device, don't even bother trying the latest build.  It won't work.  Older versions used to run just great on my 2.2 tablet but the latest upgrade is just TOO big and, as others have pointed out, it cannot be moved to the SD card. Therefore it won't load, it won't install, I've attempted to reinstall it 3 times tonight, and I've got it to the point where it will at least open but it won't copy books down from the Archive/Library. I've spent what to me is a lot of money on e-books and now I can't use them.  There's no excuse for this app to be this big.  Amazon needs to stop trying to force-feed customers cr*p they don't want and keep the focus on what customers DO want:  an app that actually works, and books the CONSUMER chooses.  I'm absolutely livid.  For God's sake, it's not THAT hard to make the legacy .apk available!!!
B00OCKS28Q|5|Love &#34;hide away&#34;
B00992CF6W|5|You should get this app because it rocks but there is not as much stuff as in the one on the computer but still you should get this app.
0802473156|5|Great Books!  Recommend all of them.  Quick shipping, Great price.
B0091REZMW|1|Terrible game.  Wish I had never downloaded it.  Would not recommend it to anyone. Not worth my time or anyone else's time
B00MU79IL8|5|Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who would of thought this pair could be so good.  No generation gap here.   A great selection of songs from the swing era.  Good music is never out of date.
B007SOQBCM|3|Needs HD, and Twitch accounts added.
B008K9SG9K|5|I heard them at the grammy and was so moved by their power!! It's a great exciting CD!!! It's fun to listen in the car!!!
2067002627|5|Very well done.  Plan to use this map for a trip to Normandy and find battle sites from D-Day.
B007HU4FZ2|1|A snuff film.  And it doesn't follow scripture so Gibson can appeal to anti-semitism and homophobia.  The opening scene is blasphemy, the androgynous-looking devil didn't change into a snake, and Jesus therefore didn't crush him.    The only time Jesus ever uses force in the scripture is when He flips over the tables of the money-changers at His Father's temple.  If there is only one thing to be learned from the life of Jesus Christ, it is to hate hypocrisy.  And this film starts off with it, and never relents.
B003Q6D2B4|5|Let me make this short and sweet.  If, like me (in my 75th year) you're an old fart and you still have a funny bone in your aging body, move your cursor up and to the right and click on the &#34;Add to Cart&#34; button.  You'll be glad you did.  Bruce has a fine tradition of bringing comic book characters 'to life' (Unbreakable, Sin City) but this really takes the cake given the Geriatric Gang he brought along.  And once you've clicked that button above, move along to Retired Extremely Dangerous 2 and do the same.  Great fun!
B001S33D1G|5|I fell in love with this story. It is one the books I whould want with me on a deserted island.
6305546789|5|HALLOWEEN marks John Carpenter's fist and unexpected strike in the world of horror.<br />You can't do a movie better on this budget ($320,000). Don't expect too much in the first half of the movie. BUT the rest of the movie is worth to wait a century for it!<br />Pros:<br />- unbeatable atmosphere in the whole movie<br />- Anamorphic Widescreen and Full Screen format<br />- Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Stereo Surround and oringinal Mono<br />- THX certified<br />- the main menu is well done and scary<br />- tons of extras (trivias, photos, radio and tv spots, trailers,...)<br />- it's THE original<br />Cons:<br />- no commentary track<br />Forget all those SCREAM-copies... This is definetly THE evergreen must-have horror movie!
0790729342|3|Great movie, fine quality, but not much more than you would have gotten on a VHS tape.  Would like to see more bonus content.
B0088TG252|4|good action movie, great actors, fast paced, and enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.
0765325950|1|Just not up to par. Ryan Sanderson wrote two great novels to revive the franchise, but this last one stunk. In a word: Boring. I found myself skipping whole segments just to finish it. It was almost as bad as GRR Martin's Clash of Kings. Actually, it might have been worse. I very infrequently read books where I keep saying in my mind, \\"who gives a crap about this anymore,\\" but that's what happened during this one.
B00TEAVEY8|5|Excellent game but it's a little simple
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I really recommend this for kids and teens it is really fun.
B000AGTPUK|5|It's truly a wonderful Christmas classic for the family. The movie teaches children to have faith-to believe, and it also reminds adults the true spirit of Christmas. I think it's a very clever to present the movie like an animated cartoon, because it gives a fantasy-like feeling. Tom Hanks and the children acted fine in this film. They expressed their character's feelings really well. <br />The theme song \\"Believe\\" by Josh Groban is a really powerful song that captures the Christmas spirit and sums up the central message of the movie. I love this song very much. <br />Go get it if you haven't already! <br /> <br />Stroy A <br />Acting B+ <br />Direction B+ <br />Visuals A-
1907947655|5|Beautifully written, the characters are very real and the description of the time and era is very Romantic. Coming of age story of a family who had its share of pain and disappointment, having 5 girls, so naturally they had to marry well to help the other members of the family. Very similar to what young women toady are told to look for from a very early age.
B004SIIBGU|5|It works great!  I have used it for several months now to make purchases and receiving recommendations and I am extremely happy with this service.
B007SGLZP8|5|i try to follow all of his writings, as i am from the same regions that he sometimes writes about.  did not like Calico Joe, though.
B00FPM19UI|5|I watched this as soon as I closed the door behind the UPS lady who brought it. I recommend it to any Nightwish fan and especially to any fans they lost because of Annette, their previous singer. Floor Jansen is 10 times better than Annette and at least as good as Tarja.<br />It seems to be about half older Tarja stuff and half newer Annette stuff but Floor nails it all and leaves you begging for more. Floor has me excited for the next Nightwish album.
B00ATPVA78|4|Game was too short, should have been longer. Graphics were beautiful, voice over should have been better. Overall a good game, but not great.
B0083UUV12|5|I started reading this series after giving it to my goddaughter for her birthday... and it turns out I got way more obsessed with it than she did! Excellent plotline that pulls you in right away!
B00H71PBQ8|5|Downton Abbey is always a great watch! I'm looking forward to the next season! Great acting, scenery, plot line, etc.
160309007X|1|I am, or rather I was, a huge fan of Alan Moore's work. Until I read League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Volume III: Century 2009 and realized that Moore has gone off the deep end. The deep respect for his source material obvious in Moore's ingenious melding of classic works of fiction that was the hallmark of the first two volumes is gone. League 2009 is Moore taking a big fat dump on all of modern society and modern fiction. As a member of modern society and a fan of modern fiction, I can't help but feel that the entire book is a middle finger directed at me and everyone else with the audacity to be younger than Moore. He has become a curmudgeon, a doddering old coot perched on his rocking chair, cradling his shotgun and muttering about them damn comic book publishers what kilt his dog and took his leg.<br /><br />Reading League 2009 is an experience very much like watching the movie adaptation of Volume I starring Sean Connery, in that both works are much further removed from Volume I than Volumes I and II are from the works that inspired them. Moore has gone from creating a satire/pastiche of 19th century fiction to creating a shoddy parody of his own work. Thus far, I have intentionally not discussed the content of League 2009 because it's barely woth discussing, but I suppose I should give it a once over. Everything is terrible, Orlando has to out on some 3D glasses so (s)he can get bitched at by Prospero, and then Orlando, Mina and Allan fail to save the world from Harry Potter's eyeball-covered lightning-shooting genitals. No, I am not making this up. If you're wondering if it's really as bad as that hasty summary makes it sound, well, trust me, it is.
B00B2V66VS|1|this game is slow, any crashes a lot.  it does not work well with the kindle fire.  it is so fun but crashes too much. I hope imamgi updates it
B002NZTZ8S|5|A very encouraging movie!
B000002B5L|1|I had been to a Fugees concert in Dublin. When the band started dropping bottles on their own fans I and many others were disgusted. Analysing this CD, most of the melodies are plagiarised from other artists - Enya, Abba etc (Some acknowledged, others not). I urge you - please do not support these people.
B005ZMUTZ4|5|We watch it 4 times a day
0321965515|5|This book was far more entertaining than I expected. It's packed with good, sound information for anyone who builds websites, especially those concerned with user experience.
B00IG2DOKM|5|What a fun game. It keeps you thinking and doesn't always ask for you to spend money to keep playing. LOVE IT! !!
B00OAKTEIU|4|I watched some of the videos for songs from this cd on Youtube and read the comments as i do. Many of them were comparing this cd to work done by Marilyn Manson and i reluctantly agree. There may have been either an influence or just by strange coincidence there are some similarities. This does not take away any of the feeling put into the production of these songs. I think they have only evolved into band that is growing into band that is here to stay.<br />From the first  track &#34;The Infection&#34;  I knew i would like this cd. I think if you like 'In This Moment' you will like this because of its new direction musically.Hope this helps you
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Excellent game. I love puzzlers and this is so mooth and polished. Definitely worth every minute I spent playing it.
0743455967|5|Mr. King, a name synonymous with horror fiction, as well as the writer's craft in general, presents a memoir/journal of the trade of writing that reads with his typically engaging styles. It is brief, in comparison with his other works, and is written in a personal style that flows more like a conversation than a text.     While the memoir is entertaining and engaging, the real heart of the book is in the notes on writing that occupy the middle of the work. It is not a comprehenive book on editing and style (such as Strunk & White, or assorted other books), but provides little bits of advice that have provided me with more motivation and guidance than most of the other books that I have read on the art of writing.     King is not only a gifted storyteller, and engaging writer, but a plain-spoken teacher who's trials in the realm of writing should be enough to encourage most students of the art to aspire to greater ability and renown. In the library of a man who is known as one of our century's most prolific writers, this is a rare and precious gem of knowledge, from one who has gone before. Mr. King reminds us that writing is first and foremost fun, and a journey that never really ends.
B001O4FGG4|5|I LOVE this movie! I lent it out to some friends, and guess what? Right! They never returned it, so I just re-ordered it. I love the price..very affordable, got here in good time, and no damage at all! very cool. Thank You!!
B002UJIY7A|5|This is a superb suspensful, chair gripping movie. Steve Zahn really surprised me in this film with his acting skills. Most movies I have seen of him are comedies so it was really nice seeing him play such a monster in this movie.
B00005JNBQ|4|There are two rival trends today in Mormon comedy. The first, and more unsuccessful, IMHO, embraces the \\"Singles Ward\\" family of films. There are a mixture of the solid Hale Family of thespians, with a mixture of the Brigham Young University's \\"Divine Comedy\\" and \\"Garrens\\" troupes.  They have the more slapstick, and even  Church Talent Night feel to them. In essence, they are the Jay Leno's of Mormondom.<br /><br />The other trend are the independent humorists, such as [...] and this film Napoleon Dynamite.  They are outside the normal institution and organs of Mormon humor, and therefore had to struggle to make their comedy work.  They are the David Lettermens of the Mormondom.  Which is why they are actually funnier.<br /><br />What can I say about this film?  When you present an anti-hero as hero, your competition is primarily the \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" franchise.  To his credit, Hess is able to have the same vibe, transplant it to southern Idaho, and throw in some Theater of the Absurd to boot.<br /><br />That is what you are getting, and that is why the film works with so many people.  If, as Carl Matheson assets, \\"The Simpsons\\" humor is \\"hyper-irony,\\" then this film's humor is \\"hyper-quirkiness.\\"  It melds Seinfeld \\"A show about nothing,\\" with Babbitt's mediocrity.  The dialogue is two steps above drivel, but that is the charm of the movie.  You get a series of \\"A Slice Of Life\\" themes that are like the prop GNDN tubes on Star Trek: \\"Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes I got he feeling that I was watching a so-called \\"reality show,\\" where a person makes no real intellectual or moral development in the process of the film.  Maybe ND is just a good natured Forrest Gump shipwrecked in Idaho.<br /><br />I think the key to the movie is ND's conceptual reference point. He reminds me of Calvin from the funnies-some panels Hobbes is a stuffed tiger, but in the more interesting panels Hobbs is as alive as Calvin's parents.  C. S. Lewis mentions that he had this same problem growing up: he had the external realm of studies and family, but he has the vibrant inner world of Wagner and Boxon, which at times, was more real than the so-called real world (Surprised By Joy, Chapter 8).<br /><br />ND has the same problem. He speaks of the liger, with it's magical properties, has the retro-80's \\"Pegasus Crossing\\" sign on his door, and the poster to the classic film \\"Dragonslayer.\\"  He is obsessed with nun-chucks and judo skills, but doesn't quite understand why he should wear the kung-fu pants.  He buys the suit at the Deseret Industries thrift store, but doesn't see that it looks weird, even with his retro 70's looks in the retro 80's town.  For ND, his clothes have become so old, they are back in style again.<br /><br />So there you have him: the fluctuating reference point-he has not quite left the magical stage that most of us leave in out early teens (See \\"The Road Less Traveled, p. 86-87).  This magical point of view is his charm is. He is a man-child like Brian Wilson or Wildman Fischer.  If Napoleon grows up, he will either be a total failure, or a monumental success.  With the white horse, things for Napoleon is looking up.<br /><br />NOTE:  for the love of mud, DO NOT DO A SEQUAL!  This film has to end as abruptly as it began.  ND has to stay a retro 70's teenager in a retro 80's town lost somewhere in the retro 00's.  Do anything-a documentary, a prequel, or even a Saturday cartoon series with a breakfast cereal tie-in, but no sequel!that he had this same problem growing up: he had the external realm of studies and family, but he has the vibrant inner world of Wagner and Boxon, which at times, was more real than the so-called real world (Surprised By Joy, Chapter 8). <br /> <br />ND has the same problem.

B008N9AAQ4|5|This is quite simply a stunning watch. It doesn't tell a story in the conventional sense, but it does have a narrative that runs unspoken through the film. In essence it is a collection of clips filmed across the world, it is edited to form a sequence covering aspects of life from a myriad of cultures. There's no speech it's all silent with a superb soundtrack, again reflecting the multicultural vision of the film.<br /><br />The visuals are amazing, it has to be watched in high definition. The glimpses of lives all over the world make this a fascinating watch. Some of it is uplifting, at other times cruel and disturbing, but it is always interesting.<br /><br />The soundtrack is also worth mentioning containing a variety of songs that match the visuals perfectly. This is an awe inspiring film, the two hours just passed by without notice.<br /><br />You may have guessed that I really enjoyed watching this and I won't apologise if I sound like I'm gushing and I can't recommend this enough.
B00BURWSHA|5|Great product and first-class service.
B00000JMQE|1|I have never written an online review, but I felt compelled to warn anyone who thinks of buying this DVD that this film is probably the single worst film ever released...Do not go near this one...The production values are laugh-out-loud terrible and the storyline is completely uninteresting. Do not go near this and who gave this film 4 or 5 stars??? I am shocked
B00HBQWGXK|1|Really, don't read this book, it is sooooo boring.
B009VB9VKY|5|I rented this movie because my adult daughters kept talking about it.  It was ok. Needless to say there wasn't much of a story line. But if you like to look at nearly naked men, you will like the movie.  As always, MMC plays a good part.
B0080CL0HM|4|The quote used in the caption for this review is form the writer of the novel on which this film BEL AMI is based - Guy de Maupassant, whose stories are characterized by their economy of style and efficient, effortless d&eacute;nouement. In many ways that quote summarizes the plot of this story.<br /><br />BEL AMI  is set in Paris in the upper-middle class environment of the leading journalists of the newspaper La Vie Française and their friends. It tells the story of Georges Duroy (Robert Pattinson), who has spent three years of military service in Algeria. After six months working as a clerk in Paris, an encounter with his former comrade, Forestier (Philip Glenister), enables him to start a career as a journalist. From a reporter of minor events and soft news, he gradually climbs his way up to chief editor. Duroy initially owes his success to Forestier's wife (Uma Thurman) who helps him write his first articles and, when he later starts writing lead articles, she adds an edge and poignancy to them. At the same time, she uses her connections among leading politicians to provide him with behind the scenes information which allows him to become actively involved in politics. Duroy is also introduced to many politicians in Madame Forestier's drawing-room. Duroy becomes the lover of Forestiers' friend Clotilde Marelle (Christina Ricci), another influential woman. Duroy later tries to seduce Madeleine Forestier to get even with her husband, but she repulses Duroy's sexual advances and offers that they become true friends without ulterior motives instead. In a few months, Charles Forestier's health deteriorates and he travels to Cannes to regain it. Soon afterwards, Duroy receives a letter from Madeleine imploring him to come to join her and help her bear the last moments of her husband's life. As Forestier dies, Duroy asks Madeleine to marry him. After a few weeks to consider, she agrees. Georges now signs his articles Du Roy (an aristocratic style of French name) in order to add prestige to his name. The married couple travel to Normandy, the region of Georges's childhood, and meet his peasant parents. Finding the reality different than her romantic expectations, Madeleine feels very uncomfortable with his parents and so their stay with them is short. In the newspaper office, Duroy is ridiculed for having his articles written by his wife, just as the late Forestier had his articles written by her. His newspaper colleagues call him `Forestier', which drives Georges mad and he suddenly becomes heavily jealous of Madeleine, insisting that she admit having been unfaithful to Forestier, but she never does.<br /><br />In order to suppress the stings of jealousy, Duroy starts an affair with Mme Virginie Walter (Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of the owner of the newspaper. He especially enjoys the conquest as he is her first extramarital lover. Later on, however, he regrets the decision, for he cannot get rid of her when he does not want her. Duroy's relations with his wife become chillier, and at one point he takes a police superintendent to a flat in which his wife is meeting a minister. They catch the two in the act of adultery, which was then a crime punishable under the law.<br /><br />Duroy's ascent to power continues. Duroy, now a single man, makes use of his chief Rousset (Colm Meaney) daughter's (Holliday Grainger) infatuation with him, and arranges an elopement with her. The parents then have no other choice but to grant their assent to the marriage. The last chapter shows Duroy savouring his success at the wedding ceremony at which 'all those who figured prominently in society' were present. His thoughts, however, chiefly belong to Mme de Marelle who, when wishing him all the best, indicates that she has forgiven him for his new marriage and that their intimate meetings can be taken up again.<br /><br />Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod are novices and the pacing of the film could use some polish. The sets and costumes are the stars and the musical score by both Rachel Portman and Lakshmam Joseph De Saram and cinematography by Stefano Falivene mange to creat the atmosphere of La Belle Epoque well.  The cast is strong, though the title role of Georges Duroy (aka Bel Ami) feels undercast: Robert Pattinson lacks the depth of subtlety in his current acting skill to be convincing as the poor cad of this rags to riches via abuse of women role.  It will be interesting to see if this film will last once it is released in theaters.

B00594XOZU|5|i love kik awesome way to reach your friends quick
0545259088|4|As much as I wanted this series to last forever (literally), all good things must come to an end. From the start of Shiver, to the very last word in Forever, Maggie's writing remained stunning with a touch of skillfully staged set of events. The journey I experienced with Sam, Grace and the gang will remain imprinted in my mind as one of the best wolf trilogies. It's just one of those long lasting stories filled with impressionable characters that tap into your emotional chamber. With each installment, Maggie gave me the chance to understand Sam and Grace better in separate narrations. I very much respected the fight between their obstacle of love, even in their moments of division. Plus, all the other characters such as Isabel and Cole, contributed an amusing aspect in the progression of the series. Those two were definitely a handful I couldn't get enough of, especially when they were in the same room together.<br /><br />Now, in all honesty, Forever wasn't my favorite part of the trilogy. Shiver fortunately holds the title for my wow factor reaction. However, the continuation was just as addictive, even if it read a little slower for me the third time around. I have a feeling it could have to do with the conclusion, I just didn't receive the closure I expected. Besides that, it was an exciting and nerve wracking ride to see Grace grow into her inner animal. She is an admirable protagonist I'll be sad to leave behind. And of course, who wouldn't miss Sam! His devotion and consistent love for Grace, puts shame to a lot of boyfriends. I will truly miss this series and I hope to one day re-visit it again in a spin off. Hm, wouldn't that be a hell of a surprise! *sighs* I'll keep dreaming for that. In the mean time, I hope to fall in love with the The Scorpio Races just as much as Maggie's unforgettable debut.
0743268091|5|While I truly enjoyed The End of Faith, it pales in intellectual clarity when compared to David Eller's Natural Atheism. While Mr. Eller's book isn't as easy to read, it is infinitely more relevant for our time. Read Natural Atheism and you won't need to spend (waste) any more time discussing childish religious precepts, concepts, and superstitions.

B0064MPXFA|5|Finding a character with those qualities in today's world seems a fantasy. However, The Good Wife is convincingly real, and it is a pleasure see one who is also a good lawyer and mother too in the complex world of law. In the first season, I found the crimes a little queazy and a little difficult to follow. Even the criminals have an interesting and complex side as the show develops over time. The prosecution becomes every bit as interesting as the defense over time. The characters develop depth all around. The various judges are all fascinating. In these days it is refreshing to see a program that has sympathy for (nearly) all the characters. The guest actors are all good, but I would not hang the success of the show on that. I think Alicia, Diane, and Kalinda are a great collaboration.
1250040779|3|If you haven't been reading Jeffrey Archer's saga, The Clifton Chronicles, I'd advise you not to start with this book because it is certainly not a series that can be enjoyed out of sequence. If you're reading my review of this, the third book in the series, however, I'll just assume you're familiar with the other books. Still, I'll try to avoid any spoilers.<br /><br />There's no question that I enjoyed Best Kept Secret better than the last book, The Sins of the Father, though I'm not sure it's quite as good as the first one, Only Time Will Tell. None of the &#34;secrets&#34; in this book (which, based on the title, should be full of secrets, or at least one big one) are as interesting or gripping as the ones in Book One, but the conflicts among the characters still make for an excellent read. I did miss Maisie Clifton, though, who seemed to be absent from the book entirely.<br /><br />One thing I'm noticing about this series is that Archer is fond of ending each book with a cliffhanger, though I'm not sure if the payoff is always worth the suspense. After three boos, I'm inclined to assume that the &#34;shocking ending&#34; of Best Kept Secret will be revealed to be a misunderstanding of some sort. I could be wrong (just a guess, not a spoiler), but I doubt it.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer has said that the Clifton series is semi-autobiographical. If so, I suspect it's more wish fulfillment on his part than memoir. His two male protagonists, Harry Clifton and Giles Barrington, have a lot in common with Archer, but they also have no faults. If Harry is accused of stealing, it's because he's covering for someone else. If he goes to prison, it's an elaborate case of mistaken identity. If Giles loses an election it's only because of election tampering. Even when Giles is fighting with his family over money, Archer makes it clear that his wife made him do it. Considering Jeffrey Archer's own checkered past with money, politics and prison, I doubt he could pretend to be as blameless as his fictional heroes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, faultless heroes often become dull. Let's hope the next book in the series, Be Careful What You Wish For, either dirties Harry and Giles up a bit or else focuses on the more three dimensional characters (bring back Maisie!).blameless as his fictional heroes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, faultless heroes often become dull.

0061703257|2|Are you kidding me Dennis? SPOILERS SIPOERSL LIOSPRSE ETC ECT TCE: Okay, so the first thing I'm thinking at the very end of the PRO-FREAKING-LOGUE is, oh, Teddy must be one of the patients, or soon will be. 1/3 of the way through the book, Mr. Lehane says here's my super mystery code, and here is how you crack it, because it is so smart that I need to tell you how or you'll never figure it out! Well, that means that when we get the next set of code #'s we easily translate them to: (r,s,d,i,e,d,w,a,l,d,s,n,e). Uh, don't those letters make up A-N-D-R-E-W L-A-E-D-D-I-S, assuming you are not blind? Oh and, I can see another name as well, EDWARD DANIELS. So, they are the same guy. And the next simple code of Rachel Solando = Dolores Chanal? So this is all in Teddy's head, like he's a looney on this island? Surely it can't be that simple cause I'm not even half way through the book yet, I thought! Long story short, that's exactly how it turned out, killing any possible ounce of suspense I had that it took me another 3 days just to finish it, with the slight hope that it was all setup as a prelude to some mindblowing ending....NOPE. To make it worse, Mr. Lehane thought it would be cool to spend about another 50 PAGES JUST TO SUM UP HIS ELCIREBNDI COED which should have taken 2 pages!!!!!! UKFC!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />The reason I gave this 2 stars and not one is simply because the ATMOSPHERE, and the POTENTIAL were both there, and Dennis let it slip  through the cracks. I usually don't look forward to a movies version right after reading the same book, but hopefully the Scorsese/DiCaprio tandem can make it more thrilling...it shouldn't be hard!

I thought the characters were strong with quality dialog, and the world that the author built in &#34;Cult of Mirrors&#34; is intriguing and full of excitement. I read this book pretty fast because I had a hard time putting it down. I highly recommend it.
B008JFUPFI|4|I'll make this short and get to only the important things, everything else is a waste of time to talk about. Remember just as many women saw this movie as men. The movies was 2 hours 23 minutes. The first hour was by far the best sci-fi, alien, extreme technology, krypton, superman piece of cinematography, and realism with compelling twist and turns (they thought of everything) I ever seen ever in any movie, at this point in the movie I turned to my wife and said, \\"this is the best movie I've ever seen to this point\\" and she said yeah me too\\". Then 5 minutes later the fighting started between Clark and Zod, and his peeps. Oh, my God it wouldn't stop!! The fighting went on non-stop for an hour and 10 minutes, it was absolute torture and the women who went to see this movie for the romance, some light action and fantasizing about the super hero hunk, were likely vomiting in the aisles like my wife was after the first 40 minutes of non-stop blown gasket complete destruction of what appeared to be a city the size of new York, it was 911 30 times over and over, and over. After 40 minute you were sick and still had to endure 30 more minutes of extremely loud destruction. Why they couldn't have shown Clark passing a physics test so that at some point during this 70 minute fight someone couldn't have outsmarted the other and put this superfight and city destruction to rest. Anti-climactic and stupid, he snaps his neck, sorry just don't buy the retarded ending to ZOD. Wow, the stupidity. In their defense if there is one, which there is not, the storyline where Clark meets Zod and defeats him is always the more negative and less inspiring of all the storylines, with too much fighting where no one seems to win. Wow, I'm tired just thinking about this.<br /><br />I may still buy the movie, not sure, but what I am sure about is I will fast forward through at least 40 minutes of fighting and destruction, so I'm not pissed off again watching a movie that previously had the best hour and 5 minutes of movie I have ever witnessed. Special effects in this movie are off the charts like no previous superman movie. Anyone who was not conscious of this hour plus of pointless destruction without anyone winning for 70 minutes and not being aware and fully aggravated by this continuous waste of time using computer special effects for all of it is an idiot. Those who loved the movie and didn't point this out are an idiot. It ruined a perfectly good movie that could have for the first time for a superman movie won a number of awards. The superman actor is by far the best actor for this character ever, who has the convincing thickness of a fully competing body builder with perfect proportions and chiseled facial construction like those superman faces in the comic books, who by the way don't look real because they are too perfect. They should make many superman films with him.<br />The Storylines, the cinematography, the special effects combined with the story were fully unimaginable, yet they did create them, many of them, fantastically so, and continually surprising you with the newest ideas for the story, that kept you entranced for the 1st hour . .  I want to buy the movie just to watch the 1st hour. My advice, hold you breath and you ears for at least 30 minutes of the hour plus fight or you'll leave pissed off like we did. 4 stars.
B004XUMPFQ|5|Yes, excellent.  We want more! The best sci-fi series of all time needs to have more episodes.  Everybody grab your pitchforks and torches so we can demand more Firefly!
B00HTC0L8I|5|MORE twists and turns than a drifting race! The background of the early 1950s is vivid, and the portrayal of mental disorders reflects the time period. Characterization is marvelous--dialogue (both outer AND inner) fast paced and gritty. This is my first Lehane novel--but NOT my last!
0385738781|5|I love it
B00FAPF5U0|3|I mean it's awesome and all but it kind of boring I need a little more excitement.
B00BKZUVGM|5|I have now read the Divergent Trilogy. I was not sure what to expect when i made my purchase however I soon found the books to be very hard to put down. I ended up reading all three books as one and was delighted with the story line throughout. I would recommend these books to anyone who enjoys science fiction.

6303908306|5|The second-best crime film ever made, a completely original idea and  fabulous dircting makes The Usual Suspects what it is.  The characters  include five criminals, Dean Keton, a retired criminal who now is  romantically involved with a criminal lawyer, and they have gone into the  restaurant business together.  keton is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is  well-cast, but not as well-cast as he is in End of Days, where he plays the  devil.  Stephen Baldwin plays McManus, a loud, crazy, but effective entry  man.  He plays this sort of role to a T, but he has been type-cast for his  career thanks to his role.  Kevin Pollak plays Todd Hockney, the explosives  expert, who doesn't care about anyone.   Pollak is great at this kind of  role, and he has some great lines.  Benicio del Toro, in his breakthrough  role, is hilarious as a wisecracking criminal with a speech impediment.   The speech impediment, where he mumbles constantly, makes him hard to  understand, but it's very, very funny.  And finally, to round out the  criminals, Verbal Kint, a cripple, played by the not yet so famous Kevin  Spacey.  Kevin Spacey is awesome in this movie.  This is his best acting  job ever.  He won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work, and  it is well deserved.   The opening lineup scene is a classic, and is  possibly the greatest opener ever, second only to the Diner Scene, from  Reservoir Dogs.  The story is told by Kevin Spacey, who is the sole  survivor of a mass slaughter in the San Pedro harbor, involving a ship.   The five men were sent to destroy coke on a boat by the mysteriously shifty  Keyzer Soze, who has never been seen by anyone, that has lived to tell the  tale.  Spacey is telling his account to U.S. Customs Agent David Cuyan, who  has a personal vendetta against Keton.  The movie jumps around a little,  but by the second viewing it is easy to follow.  The chilling climax will  leave you speechless, and will put your head in a whirl.  Enjoy!
B0029O0BKO|5|Over the top is one of my favorite Sylvester Stallone movies it's about how he goes to pick up his son at military school so they can meet each other and how is grandfather don't want him to know him because he sends guys out for him he sly Stallone is a truck driver Lincoln Hawk and he's going to a arm wrestling tornament and son found all the letters that was hidden from him in purses so if you didn't see this movie i recommend its one of his best family movies that everyone can watch.
B0094M4R3Q|5|My three kids (4-8 years old) all thought this was a very funny movie. They were laughing through most of the show!
B003TSEEDY|5|Great book!!  Engaging, soulful, a great story.  One of those books that you hate to see end.  Highly recommend it......now to see the movie.
142312166X|5|My grandson just loved it...he is 13.  I read some of it-really; intersting and sets  frees the imagination, the next granson down has just started reading it, he is 11.
B0089LOG02|5|Everyone should read this novel!
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Smart and Funny !!
B003U6BE8I|5|I throughly enjoyed the movie. I thought it was well acted and that the sets and effects were very well done. I think it's safe to say that it doesn't measure up to the books, but that NEVER happens. I took it for what it was, didn't put it into the same category as the book, and ended up really liking it.
0307276902|5|Contrary to one of the reviews written by a \\"pompous ass\\" himself <br />he totally misses the mark on the book.  It's of journey through hell by James Frey.  It is true; nothing is sugar coated; it's raw and emotional.  It is his experience and he tells it from \\"his experience.  That's the way he was when he was in rehab.  This is how it is in the real world of rehab.  It is a gut wrenching, emotional book of how one man beat the odds of rehab by not using the AA 12 step program.  He recovered by \\"choice\\" and if more people in the world excercised their decisions by \\"choice\\" it would be a better world.  I recommend this book to everyone that has an addict in their family or knows an addict.  It will give you a different perspective from the addict's addictions. I applaud Mr. Frey's choices. <br />Two thumbs up! <br />Shelley
B002GYI9C4|3|Entertaining as far as Fantasy and magic ...<br />Too much Revolution flowing into Religion without, that part NOT well done

B00005J6T1|5|All right, so maybe if you listen to this and then RAY OF LIGHT this album may seem like nothing except a little piece of pop fluff, but I recommend you look past that. This album contains some of Madonna's greatest work, such as &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, the latter 3 she wrote herself. Take it from someone who owns the original CD of this album, the remastering of these tracks is such a great breath of fresh air for them. Madonna's confidence, style, and great sense-of-self radiate through this album and are a great sign of what was to come. Sure, she may be at her best right now, but don't be afraid to pay a visit to Madonna of 1983. It really shows you how talented she has always been, as well as how wonderfully she has progressed and developed over time. This album is essential to your CD collection, order it as soon as you can, there will be no regrets, I guarantee it.
0752545639|4|It is very nice to have the complete works in one place.  I do have to agree with another reviewer on the pages being so thin; my highlighter pen bled through to both sides and when I scibbled notes in the margins, it shows through on the opposite side making it difficult to read.  But, even with that, the benefit of having a ready reference to so many cherished words is worth the inconvenience to me.  I just decided to use light pencil marks to annotate my favorite passages and that alleviated that problem.
0375707972|5|Being German, I have read many books on the holocaust and WWII.  However, no book has moved me as much as this one.  Written by a German, this book takes a completely different approach to the topic of the holocaust and the rise of the Nazis, a human approach. It allows the reader to read about this time without feeling intimated or uncomfortable.  Schlink broaches the subject in a very unique way, very indirectly, but lets the reader understand the horrors of that period in German history - I was very moved.  The story itself is very clever and well written.  It's hard to say that one enjoyed reading about such a topic, but it was for me a very refreshing and refined way to look at how this period in German history affected Germans.  Not in an in your face way.  This is a fine piece of literature.
B005GRTNVE|5|tHIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM BY IL DIVO.  THEY ARE THE GREATEST.  EVERYTIME I HEAR THEM SING, I HOLD MY BREATH AND THINK JUST HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE.  THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE GROUP AND INDIVIDUALLY.
B00KMX5V8G|2|Very fun game and lots of little bonuses and endless life's
B0018STVHQ|5|This is my favorite movie. It's a rarity that great movies are common these days, so I am very greatful for the release of this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5|this ap was a total life saver!  I found it was very easy to use and its accompanying apps were also easy to use. I use evernote for shopping lists,  projects and pictures, I even kept a recipe notebook. I highly recommend this if you surf around for projects, crafts, food ideas, or anything else you can imagine.
B003M70O5O|5|Great show!
B00000AFGM|4|Mechanical Animals was Manson's peak album in many ways, not so much for music as for the direction he would take in the albums to come.  Instead of the Sex/Drugs/RocknRoll theme, this album explores the room behind the mirror on that lifestyle, as is evident by the names of songs such as Speed of Pain, Rock is Dead, I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me, Coma White, Last day on Earth and countless other incredibly original tracks.  Manson breaks away from the Metal God image and goes into something profoundly different, exploring alternate idenities, androgyny, after effects of pleasure and creativity for creativity's sake.  This album doesn't have the intense anger and rage behind it as the other 2 did, but it certainly has lost none of the emotional qualities that define his music.  Its easy to see how one could interpret a Bowie-esque style here with the glam look and the Omega labelling, but the lyrics remain authentically Manson with the poking and proding at what is percieved as normal, and the mockery and challenge to break away from it all.  A nice change of pace from the hard metal, Manson proves he's not just a one dimensional artist but indeed has what it takes to back up the intelligent image he has worked hard to deserve.
0062082353|5|Great insight into how snipers perform and displayed excellent knowledge of sniper skills.  Also, enjoyed personal comments in his life.
B00AQ3K8IU|3|Geared to a younger audience, almost put it down after the first few chapters.  However, it got more interesting as i progressed. Loved the interesting plot twists in the latter part of the book.
B004TI1WME|5|Does exactly what it I need.
B00LLMFAAG|5|Awesome
B005MRXS78|5|A fun item to have for panning and tilting your camera with, especially with the use of the remote control device. Price is reasonable.
B008MM9630|5|like the app; just don't like that you have to spend money on gems to get a lot of the items.
B000NYT1M6|5|My nephew (4 years old) forgot all the others presents for his birthday!!!. The truck resists the treatment of Nelson. He uses outdoor and indoor and stays strong
B004GJNFHG|2|This film is certainly a strong piece of cinema but for me it was ultimately unsatisfactory.  I had expected a deeper exploration into the questions around the basis for the hunger strikes but this film presents such an extreme vision that it's hard to respond beyond a simple visceral reaction.  Perhaps it's because it's a subject I'm more familiar with than most (I had relatives living in NI during this time) that I expected more.  There's not much in the way of nuance here.  The hunger strikers were clearly not political prisoners (in that they were locked up for terrorist acts not for holding or espousing controversial political views - which is normally what we mean by a political prisoner) but this isn't really explored in depth by the film.  The potentially interesting issue is that they clearly saw themselves as being politically motivated and that drove them to wish to see themselves as much more than simple terrorists.  But again very little of that is explored.  It's more like watching a street brawl.  So for me I can't recommend this.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Just a Great overall game, very addicting and when you get some friends its just a huge blast to try to beat others!
078322947X|5|Just another great movie by a good actor and we will continue to look for more that he has performed in
6305350205|3|Yes Star Trek 5  had it's share of problems.  in fact there is a person on Youtube who took the movie and did their own CG graphics and it is way better than the original film.  Something Paramount should look into and arrange with this person to redo the film to make it better.   As to the worst, SORRY Mr. Ebert  but of the Trek films  Generations holds that title.  Compared to Generations, and it's story line, Trek five seems like a decent movie.   GENERATIONS  not only has a horrible story line, especially once inside the nexus.  Yeah it's 80 years after Kirk's death  and yet from his view point  he just arrived in the nexus also,  what  he lay in limbo for 80 years?  the whole opening with the 1701-B was way to fast, and short leaving  huge gaps  and questions,  then the whole soran, klingon, and especially picards alter life in the nexus  just dragged!   So No Mr. Ebert  Star Trek 5  was NOT the worse by any means.
B003UYV08E|5|It was a gift
B00OLMZIZK|2|Does not work as described. It does not mirror your background and only works with pictures, video & YouTube. Described as though it performs like Apple TV.  This does NOT work like Apple TV
B00C8S9W0G|5|Written in My Own Heart's Blood was an excellent read. Great follow-up to the previous book. Diana Gabaldon is awesome as usual. Cannot wait for the next book.
B005723JSQ|4|\\"I've Got Your Number\\" is an entertaining and light-hearted novel that I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  I think that Sophie K's writing is creative, funny, and the perfect thing for someone who wants to escape into a well-written story.  Anyone who is expecting Shakespearean-styled writing, or completely accurate non-fiction writing, is bound to be disappointed and should think twice before purchasing this book.  On the other hand, I feel that anyone who can employ a sillier sense of humor and who has a mind open to creative scenarios will enjoy reading this novel.<br /><br />I agree with some reviewers who stated that the main characters, Poppy and Sam, while likeable, were reminiscent of Becky and Luke from the Shopaholic series.  I hope that SK doesn't become a purely formulaic writer; her imagination seems capable of greater things than just plugging new names into the same old story-lines.  For example, her novel \\"Twenties Girl\\" is my favorite that she's written.  I found it to be unique, and I laughed throughout that particular book.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book, with the caveat that there are similarities to Shopaholic, and that anyone who is looking for more of a non-fiction experience might want to look elsewhere.  Personally, I really liked this book and enjoy this author.
6304795254|5|Don't read this if you haven't seen the film. Don't read this if you believe film critics ------ Sure, it's dark and winding, murky and confusing at times, but the film's ultimate message is that of hope. The entire film (read: the entire &quot;game&quot;) is designed to keep a depressed person from killing himself. What could be more positive? It's a two hour long anti-suicide mission.  Choose life, no matter how dark it gets. Great message, great film. Period.
B00005JMCW|5|hello lindsay fans<BR>this movie  is realy verry COOOOOOOOL YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE<BR>i love it <BR>greeting from the netherlands<BR>gerben van den bosch

B00DJFIMW6|5|Awesome
B0001611DI|5|This was a great movie, good acting, the blood was a too bright to be realistic and the make-up for the zombies were pretty simple.  But eventually it doesnt even matter, because as soon as they get to the mall it has you hooked.  Usually I have a problem with movies that have slow walking zombies because its not scary, just walk pass them, thats it, running zombies thats something different. But in this, Romero did good job(of course) showing what they do in numbers, so I was cool with it.  Tom Savini has a little role which was cool, overall great zombie movie!

B006JRIZJG|5|This bin does exactly what I wanted it to do. It neatly houses all 21 of my child's dolls, extra clothes and accessories, and looks cute in her room. We can pick it up and take it with us, but we rarely need to. It's heavy vinyl, definitely formed but soft enough to give, instead of tear, very brightly printed, and zips up all four sides. This makes it easy for my 8 year old to unfold it if she decides to play with the \\"doll house\\" print on the cube. She normally just plays with the lid, which has the swimming pool printed on it.<br />In a nutshell, it keeps everything together and out of her floor, and it's really cute. She loves it, and I no longer step on painful, tiny Barbie purses and shoes, therefore I love it.
B000002UAX|5|El mejor disco de los Beatles y, en mi ranking personal, el mejor disco de rock de todos los tiempos.  <br />Crudeza, mstica, salvajismo, melancola, desnudez, deliro, onirismo, premura, enfermedad, embrollo, oscuridad, amor, odio, lucidez, locura y - sobre todo - Belleza Absoluta, conforman este doble disco donde los Beatles, muy conscientes de su posicin - a aos luz de cualquier gran grupo -, desatan por fin a sus perros y se quedan tan anchos. Es gracioso recordar que esta Obra Magna en su da horroriz a los crticos 'lumbreras' y a los oos fans anclados en 'Revolver'. Tambin es gracioso recordar que an hoy en da se considere a los Beatles un 'grupo pop'. No me extender ms.
B000QRIGLC|5|Have read several times and the movie was great
B00JB3MVCW|1|Aweful movie and I love Russel Crowe.  It was not an accurate depiction of the story of Noah AT ALL and made God look like a bad guy.  If I could have given no stars I would have.
B0084IHVC0|5|Love the film. The Blu Ray has lots of nice extra features. I wouldn't pay full price for this though because it's kind of expensive. I got it for $25 and the product fits that price.
B0026P3G12|5|I love, love this CD. I am so glad that Susan Boyle is being recognized for her beautiful God-given voice and hopefully will earn a nice income after a not-so-easy life.
B00BAXFAOW|5|Malcolm Gladwell has done a really good job of going into the details of the David vs. Goliath paradigm. I especially like the analysis of the biblical battle and how various previously unknown factors played into the outcome. Once again, Gladwell has put together a treatise worth having on my bookshelf or Kindle.
B00KWVZ750|3|Lost its way for me. I prefer the original concept of a physics type game. What I did see was a visually attractive game, good for those who like this type of game
B00000JGHM|5|HEAT dazzles with styles, grips, and thrills. Arguably one of the best in its era, just like the two main cast in this film - Pacino &amp; De Niro (with the appearance of these two names, no need to say more, unless you don't give a damn about movies). No other film in the same genre offers the whole-out satisfaction as it does for the entire one hundred seventy minutes. To blink would be a waste of time while watching it.<br />Instead of raving about it, it really depends on how individuals appreciate this masterpiece. If you find it boring and lengthy, you are probably one of those dumb-fun action seeker who rather watch Jean-Claude Van Damme splitting legs, and I strongly suggest you stay away from the film because you would be disgracing it.<br />The let downs of this DVD title, one is that seems like Warner Bros. did not do a very good job on video transferring. The picture looked stretched vertically on a normal TV. And two, with a film this standard, even though it is well-worth every penny paid for, should have tons of behind-the-scenes features or at least a full-length commentary.
B008XG1X18|5|I have a kindle fire and have been waiting for this app! I love how quick and easy it is to navigate and pinning is so much easier than having to get on the browser..I would recommend this to everyone!
B000PTYPAC|5|This is a great CD, not one bad track here, and \\"Misery Business\\" is both funny and powerful.  I love this group's work.  For those of you who are older, like me; I think this group will remind you of Debbie Harry and Blondie.
B006LSZECO|1|One of the nastiest pieces of literature i have ever seen  disgusting and immoral.<br /><br />made me feel sick to my stomach
B00DR0PDNE|3|Does what it's supposed to do.  Easy set up.  Wish it was 1080p.<br /><br />Won't work with older versions of Android (and by older I mean like 2 yrs old.  That's unbelievable).  I have an Asus TF101 tablet which is running gingerbread I think and chromecast won't support it??  Doesn't Google make Android??<br /><br />But it works great with my Galaxy S3 so I'm happy about that.<br /><br />Now just TODAY I am reading that Google has released a bunch of new apps that will work with chromecast...including PLEX!  This means you should be able to cast LOCAL MEDIA without having to jump through all sorts of hoops (&#34;you can cast local media from your desktop by typing C://filename into a new chrome tab, then press CTRL+ALT+F5, B,A,B,A Select, Start, so you can play your media on the tv and still use your computer/laptop....but this won't work from your phone or tablet so you're kind of screwed there, ha!&#34;).  Read some of the other comments here and on YouTube and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />So if this is actually true then I would think about giving it 4 STARS but until I try these new apps out it gets 3 STARS.
B00BFUUMO8|4|This game is overall great. The battle arena crashes sometimes, and that's the only problem. I wish aquatic and glacier animals could battle too though, and it is taking along time to update so battle with friends will be available.
B009EEWZGU|5|Lots of story, great traditional Musical, the kind you can watch over and over again! Rod Steiger will amaze.
B0086700CM|5|A very exciting and heart rush game. Very fast pace game which I like.  I like the fast running, jumping, leaping over different things is fantastic.
B0012GMV58|5|I love Santana and when I heard this I was shaken with joy, great sounds and such soothing and beautiful songs, light up what ever you are smoking and lean back and listen you will be very happy

B00BUCXVPI|5|Great movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This is a great read. Unputdownable.....If that's a word! I enjoyed the plot. The characters seems so real especially if you've passed through high school. I can totally relate to them all.
B000XUBFE2|5|This is a VERY dark novel written about a very dark time in German history.  The setting is Munich and the time is the Second World War.  The story is about an eleven year old girl called Liesel.  But let me be clear, The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank this book is not. I don't think I've ever a read a book before this one that was actually narrated by Death.  It is a story about young Leisel and her foster family and friends who live on Himmel Street in Germany.  The story covers about 4 years of young Liesel's life, and what a life she has.  She sees more sorrow and heartache in that four year time frame than most people experience in an entire lifetime.  The book opens with Liesel and her young brother Werner traveling on a train with their mother.  An accident occurs and Liesel's brother is killed.  She carries this memory around for the rest of her life, and even after her mother abandons her in Munich, and she is taken to a foster family to live, she has nightmares every night about it.  But as it turns out, this is only the first of the horrors that Liesel experiences.  She finds some comfort with her wonderful foster family who care for her like she is their own, and with her friends, especially Rudy.  As we all know, terrible things happen in Nazi Germany during the Second World War, and this book portrays so very many of them, but there is so much love, hope and humour in it  that it makes reading the story much more real and much more heartbreaking.  This book will bring tears of joy and sadness to your eyes as you read it.  In fact I found that it was a book that struck a chord with many of my feelings and preconceived notions about Germany during this time. When I finished the last page I had to sit for a minute and contemplate what I had read and what it meant.  What more can you ask for from a work of fiction?:

B0095VPBFY|5|Bought this for a new mini-ITX build for my sister.  Paired this with an ASROCK FM2A85-X, Crucial Ballistix low profile 8GB DDR3-1600, Cooler Master Gemini II M4, InWin BP655, Syba SY-MRA55005 Multipurpose 5.25&#34; Bay Adapter. WD Black 750GB laptop HDD and generic BD-ROM/DVD-RW drive.  Got as high as 25 degrees (using CoreTemp) during the setup and O/S+program installation.  Played back a 20GB mt2s file (recorded NFC Championship game and converted to AVCHD) with no problems or dropped frames.<br /><br />The fans never once got too loud.  I don't know how the stock cooler would have fared (it does come with a cooler), but I like my computers to be as quiet as possible.  For the price this is a super product.
B0054JZC6E|5|I'm kind of addicted to unlocking new games. Some games super easy, and others require more time. I'm having fun.
B00HGJ18C2|4|I love this app, it's quick but really challenging.  However, the ads have become really annoying, especially the full page ads that you have to x out before going to the next game.  Sure hope that will be eliminated.
B00EEN66SY|4|I enjoyed this movie.  Found it pretty entertaining.
B00CSR2J9I|2|I had downloaded this game for my 4-year-old son without researching it. When the car clips and crashes it shows the driver's neck bend backwards as a snapping sound us made. I feel that this is inappropriate for his age. I will be removing it and looking for another game.

When my phone came back up and I launched the application every bit of my progress was gone. It was like I had never played the game. None of my towers were upgraded. In fact all my upgrades were wiped out. It was like I have never played this game. So playing this game almost daily since June of this year and it was all for nothing.

B00JOT3HQ2|5|Really good
B00DPM7TIG|4|I have read a number of historical novels set during World War II recently and, frankly, they all started to seem a bit conventional--until I read this one.  I'm not sure how to describe this book--the best I can say is that it was almost meditative in its prose and shattering in its plot.<br /><br />There are two parallel stories here: on of Werner, the young German with &#34;the knack&#34; for radios who finds himself in the German military and Marie-Laure, the young French girl who fled Paris with her father and found herself in Saint-Malo in the house of her eccentric great-uncle and his housekeeper.  Doerr does a nice job of keeping the two stories running simultaneously and maintaining the reader's interest in both throughout the book.<br /><br />War is not pretty, but there is something beautiful about Doerr's writing, even when he is describing atrocities.  I've noticed that novels set in war tend to cross the line into sensationalism, but Doerr deftly stays away from that.<br /><br />I will admit that there were parts of this book that I found a bit slow, but all in all it was a beautiful read that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in historical or literary fiction.  And I would really love to visit Saint-Malo!
B000R7HY0K|1|This review is a spoiler for one simple reason: I don't think anyone should ever see this movie. I simply cannot understand the high reviews this movie received from various websites, not to mention my friends. I feel that it was completely pointless. If, for some reason, you actually liked this movie, please feel free to comment as to why.    First off, I had high hopes. There were good reviews, my friends liked it, and Tarantino has directly the occasional good movie. I am also a big fan of Kurt Russell. Well, Kurt has been in some stinkers, and Quentin has directed some real dogs. This is both of them at their worst.    Let's start with the total lack of plot. Girls go out to party. Bad guy has crash resistant stunt man car. He crashes into them and kills them all because he's messed up in the head. Local Sherriff thinks he's a bad guy but can't prove it. End of act one. Act two: repeat. Except this time he picks the wrong party girls to mess with. They shoot and wound him. He cries like Nancy Kerrigan and tries to escape, wailing that he's sorry and he didn't mean it. They make him crash, drag him from his car and beat him to death. The end.     It takes two painful hours to tell this story that I typed in less than a minute. The worst part is that they set up Kurt to be a \\"cool\\" bad guy, and then turn him into a sniveling little wimp in the second half. Lame, lame, lame.     I realize that this movie is trying to do a 70s thriller camp thing, but the writing is awful. The dialogue rambles on aimlessly and reveals nothing about the story. Real people don't talk anything remotely like they do in this movie. The dialogue is about as genuine as a twenty dollar Superbowl ticket and everyone talks at hyper speeds while absolutely nothing happens. There is so much nonsensical blather going on I'm certain they killed extra trees in printing off the script.    All of the characters are annoying. The women aren't even good looking. In the first half, the one that looks half decent (Rose McGowan) gets stuck in some hideous wig, and this is magnified by the fact that I could never consider a woman who was married to Marilyn Manson attractive. She's tainted for life because of that. Rosario Dawson's infamous lap dance scene has her belly hanging out so far she looks like she is entering her second trimester. In the second half there is one nice looking woman (Lee), but she plays an insignificant role. The others are so annoying I actually want Kurt Russell to kill them, but he turns into a pansy and gets killed by them instead.     There is one character who swears like she is trying to be a female version of Samuel L. Jackson, but she fails miserably. The only person who can do Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, so don't even try. I was disappointed when she and her annoying friends didn't die.     The one minor redeeming quality of this move was Kurt in the first half. He was mildly interesting. Instead of expanding on that for the second half they turned him into sissy. Maybe Planet Terror will be better.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I finally jumped on the bandwagon with my friends and now I'm addicted too! Frustrating at times to get from one level to the next, but I do like a challenge!
B007MB5OCE|5|This book is  amazing.I loved how the story goes through his whole life, and how he influences so many big events.
B00IRMQADY|4|I thought this was an excellent film, but a bit draining. It is often tough to watch and I guess I just felt it would benefit from a few moments of...well not even happiness, as there was little...but a brief interlude of something a tiny bit upbeat. Say the slaves singing on a Sunday...Is that too much of a cliche? It just seemed to need a bit of relief...I was exhausted by the end.
B00BMKH5NW|5|Twins Cath and Wren are starting college. Even though they look exactly alike, Cath is an introvert while Wren is definitely not. Cath, convinced that her sister was going to be by her side like she has always been, is shocked when Wren decides to branch out and not room with her. Wren doesn't even want to continue writing Simon Snow fanfiction with Cath. So what do you do when the person closest to you leaves you all alone? Write more fanfiction, of course! This is the story of change, life, love, and most importantly, finding yourself in this big old world.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell has done it again. Eleanor & Park and Attachments are two of my all time favorite books so I had high expectations for this new novel. It didn't disappoint. Trust me when I tell you, once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down. So, plan accordingly. Like her two previous novels, this story is so realistic and emotionally charged. You'll fall in love with the characters immediately. Cath, Levi, Reagan...they are all so different but they have one thing in common: depth. They are charming without being fake, likable without being boring, interesting without being predictable. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />The romance aspect of this book is AMAZING. It isn't &#34;instant love&#34; and it doesn't feel forced. It is organic and beautiful. It is relatable because it doesn't cut any corners. It takes you on a journey of all of the terrifying emotions that come with falling in love for the first time. There are other kinds of relationships and love depicted in this novel that makes it one of the best books of the year. Cath's attachment to her father, her connection to her twin sister, and even the incredible relationship she was with her (sometimes bitchy) roommate makes sure this novel touches every single part of your soul.<br /><br />Now, the cover. Isn't beautiful? I feel Rowell's books are known for their minimalist covers. This one is a little bit brighter, girlier, and definitely more colorful than the rest. I know that you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover and blahblahblah but look at it! It demands to be read. All I'm saying is that if I die and I have the option to come back as a book cover, I'll choose this one.<br /><br />Even though I love all of her novels, Fangirl is my favorite of the bunch because I can relate to Cath in so many different ways. She's just a girl who is scared of growing up and is not ready to let go of her childhood. She's insecure but learns to accept herself along the way and discovers the beauty in trusting others and letting go. Most of us can see a little bit of ourselves in her and ALL of you will fall in love with her journey. I guarantee it.<br /><br />Original review uploaded to dontfoldthepage.blogspot.com
0140544518|5|Love these backward fairytales!
B000002UAF|5|excellent item fast delivery  higly recomended  thank you one of the best beatles album, jhon lenon voice is very good makes diference with ohter albums,5 stars.
B000RZGIQ8|4|Good sound and picture.  Enjoyed it.  Would recommend it for your blu-ray player.
B008IYR2BA|5|Looks like clever, complicated Dexter will be giving us another good season! We will see in the next episodes, can't really judge just yet if this one can possibly top the fifth season.
B00JH49OTS|1|This was an awful and disturbing movie.  It made me sick.  Nothing like the trailer and description.  I am so upset that I purchased it.  It was horrendous.
B003YL4LYI|5|I love the whole story of song of ice and fire. The author is brilliant and his detailed descriptions of all the characters and places keeps you glued to the pages. In this book, there are major events happening with Jon the wall and the wildings, Danny in Meereen and the dragons, and Stannis on his march and in Winterfell. Also one of our favorites tyrion and his misadventures and usual comic and amusing self. Not to mention new intriguing characters and twists but no spoilers will I reveal here.  It is a long book and there are some awesome cliffhangers so the story is not finished yet. Some people may find this annoying but I find it very exciting and eagerly waiting for the next book. In the meantime I am reading winter is coming which explains a lot of the mysteries and prophecies in the series in additions to tying it into history. What can I say I am just a real fan of Martin and his fantasy writing, although I consider myself a die hard history buff. It is amazing how I can enjoy something so different from history  but at the same time feels so real. It's all because of Martin and his story telling. So read on and enjoy!!
B00KWVZ750|5|BEST GAME EVER.
B0087GJ8KM|5|This book is extremely well written, organized and very practical, whether you're interested in selling a product, service, candidate or yourself. It is worth getting just for the chapter on Clarity in \\"selling\\" alone.
B000W0B0KM|5|Classic metal. One of the best metal albums of all time. These guys have been at it a long time. I saw them in concert recently and they still sound great!
B007QXWV1U|5|I haven't found many effects that I feel I would use on a regular basis, but those I like are far faster than loading and perfecting in photoshop. Time will tell if I want to have this stored in my kindle fire memory but as a free app it's great!
B000XUBFE2|5|Loved the story and the author's style. Interesting concept from Deaths point of view. Recommend this to all my friends.
B005LJK3AC|3|It was ok
B007SGLZP8|3|Grisham is a favorite...
B00MMPB3VG|5|love the movie.....my sons favorite movie of all time.
B008Y7CGO4|1|We watched this movie for only about five minutes then left.  We expected a movie, but the format seemed to be some kind of play with characters placed in positions of what appeared to be a board game. Sorry I can't add more. It just do not appeal to us from the start.
B0018CAAN6|1|I have been a Madonna fan from the begining and I have to say this is the worst CD shes ever put out! Is it bad? Not really, Is it anything Original, NOT AT ALL?!?! It's like she taken the best tracks from Justin Tumberlakes CD's and added her own words over his old tracks...It is just sad that Madonna has always been \\"original\\" And brought so many new sounds to ever CD shes ever put out...But this one is 100% sellout, Its sad that she would settle to do this, just to \\"get back on top?!?!?\\" I guess all she really cares about is selling more CD's and trying to catch Mariah with #1's??? TOTAL LETDOWN!!!!
B000JRYOPG|5|GREAT MOVIE FOR THE MONEY
B002OHB3IK|4|The price is a very good bargain for this album on vinyl.<br />The records sound pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.<br />It comes with a neato poster of the lyrics. Problem is, it's double sided, so if you wanna put it up on your wall, you'll have to choose which side. But that's not that big of a problem.<br />Still, very good price for a double LP.<br />I doubt you'll be dissatisfied.
B000E6UK5K|4|I think this is a very good album because he has chilled out. I can listen to this without a care in the world. If you like Floyd or Dave's first album you will love this. I like his DVD so this is a follow on from that. Well done Dave!
B000MRAAJM|4|If you like the animal and outdoors stuff this is a great set and would recommend to anyone.<br />The Blu-ray is definitely the way to go.
B00BAXFECK|3|Good, but the end left you hanging.  (What happened to other characters?)
B00006CXSS|5|I remember when the series debuted.. Honestly glad to have it to watch whenever. Best WWII movie/series ever IMO
B00RY7DCE8|5|Easy and fun.
B00JJXTP64|4|Janvier and Ash's book was as fun as one would expect from these two, who have been dancing around each other since the beginning of the series. Both have interesting back stories and there were some real emotional hits in regards to those stories.<br /><br />We also see Nassir, who quickly became top-of-my-list as far as characters I want to know more about. This strange man is going to have some crazy history to go along with him.<br /><br />Additionally we get a closer look at the Legion. I think there's a lot of potential there and I can't wait to hear more about it.
B007IXWKUK|1|I find it hilarious how much better the reviews are for this book solely because most people with brains stopped reading after the first one. I kept reading because it was free, and because I could read it on a PDF at my work computer.  I got paid to read this series, and I still regret it.  Just terrible.  At least the plot gets a bit more interesting, but still, awful.  Sex scenes are boring and repetitive, writing is awful. He's still abusive, she's still naive, and it's still an horrible message to promote to girls everywhere.  As long as he's handsome, it's okay if he treats you like crap!
B003VIWO8Y|4|This is a fairly well written easy read on Mustaine. I can't say it'll show you a softer side of him. In fact, it will probably show you that he's even more of an egomaniac that you may have originally thought. But it is honest, per how he sees things.
B002RKRGQ2|5|I have read this book many times, and it never fails to make me laugh. Wodehouse's clever plot and way with words are amazing .<br />I wish I had a Jeeves in my life!
B00KHUKUX0|5|Great album, Tesla always get's it right
B00J4KZSHW|5|I have been following, watching and listening to &#34;Amira&#34; since her audition in &#34;Holland's Got Talent&#34;.  Also, watched lots of YouTube of her interviews and as guest performer for charity.  Amira's voice is really amazing, and she has improved since winning the talent show.  This is her first CD.  The songs are wonderful and she sang/recorded them beautifully.  I have been listening to this CD almost everyday since I bought it.
B00005JOWF|2|Kurt Wimmer first burst on to the scene with the stylish, dystopic Equilibrium. This little-seen film when it was first released in the theaters soon garnered a cult following once on DVD. What was not to like about Wimmer's directorial debut. It had stylish action, a plot seemningly taken out from an Orwellian playbook and a cast of good to great performances. This sophomore effort from Wimmer got my interest the moment I read about it in the trades. It seemed like a continuation of his take on future dystopia but with a medical twist. I expected alot, though not too much that I overhyped the film to even myself, but what I finally saw once the film hit the theater was something that was a total mess.<br /><br />Ultraviolet takes place in another future dystopia where the world became ruled by a medical establishment that's become religiously fanatical in its quest to protect the world from a plague that genetically-resequenced humans into vampire-like beings called Hemophages. The main character Violet, as played by genre favorite Milla Jovovich, is such a being who is now a member of a dying and hunted species. Violet would've been a cool character if she was abit more fleshed out, so to speak. The character in the film was pretty much indestructible despite the growing odds she had to go up against. I understood from the intro sequence that Ultraviolet was playing on the comic-book style of storytelling and characterization, but Wimmer went overboard in making Violet too Ultra. The story itself doesn't even rise to the level of basic barebones. The ideas presented in the film were still interesting, but it seemed that the audience entered the film sometime during the middle part of the story. So many ideas were being forcefed to the audience through medical mumbo-jumbo that after awhile I just tuned it out. The story pretty much rushed from one talky scene to the next with techno-soundtracked action sequences filling out the gaps.<br /><br />The action looks to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium. As much as it would've looked cool in Ultraviolet, the PG-13 rating meant no blood and all the kills done so cleanly or offscreen that one almost thought they were watching something made-for-tv. Kurt Wimmer does know how to create action scenes. One in particular involves Violet on a motorcycle against several helicopter gunships. This was the only scene in the film where I actually enjoyed what I was watching. The soft, dreamlike look of the film even gave the sequence a very surrealistic feel to it. But in the end it wasn't enough to save the film. The rest of the action scenes look to be too choreographed and again the bloodless look to them didn't exactly make them better. Milla Jovovich did look good as Violet and earning a reputation as the premiere female action star, but she could've done and chosen a better project to showcase her talents.<br /><br />Wimmer really regressed alot with this second film, but rumors abound that it might not be all his fault. I don't doubt that talks of the studio getting overly involved in the editing and writing process of the film could've led to the mess that was the fiished product. It's just hard to see how a talented, up-and-coming action director like Wimmer could go from Equilibrium to Ultraviolet in such a short time. Ultraviolet looked like a film that had great intentions when it first began but ended up looking lost and deflated by the time the credits rolled. Here's to hoping that Kurt Wimmer learns from this debacle and goes back to doing what made Equilibrium a cult-fave instead of the stuff he did that made Ultraviolet awful.s to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium.

B0050DIWFC|3|INTERESTING PREMISE, but overly long explication with a a predictable outcome. Setting and portrayal of Newton Ma is spot on.
B000JMKRKC|2|I'd reread Jane Eyre rather than try this.  I suppose the book is meant to be an homage to the Gothic novel, but I thought it tried too hard and failed too often.  In fairness, I read it for a book group, and others in the group couldn't put it down.  Not me though - dull characters, convoluted plotting, heavy handed prose.  I hear the movie isn't bad though.
B000002TQV|5|I got this after OK Computer, and it blew me away. Fade Out is one of the  greatest songs I have ever heard. The Bends is a really groovy track that  will keep your head jammin. And Trees is an unbelieveable piece of music,  given that the lyrics are nothing more than abstract poetry.  A very  poetic, complex album. Black Star has the best lyrics, but the album itself  cannot even compare to anything else. A must have.
B004HXIZVC|2|I've had Soundcloud on my Kindle Fire for a few years, but just recently there was an upgrade aavailable for the app, so I upgraded. I sure wish I hadn't because now I can't access (my likes) which was the primary function on this app to me. The (my likes or my favorites)  acts as a sort of library, which now I can't access. I wish I had never upgraded. So to Kindle Fire users,  upgrade at your own risk.
B00B4VI8MQ|5|Some more difficult puzzles
0143120530|2|Not much actually information in here.
0553284347|5|This book was amazing. I recommend it even if you don't think your parents did any wrong. This book is an eye-opener, and it helps adults understand why they have problems in their life, even when they've moved out and away from their parents. Highly recommended to EVERYONE.
B001AH6ZWY|4|I like the science-positive approach of the movie and the hopefulness. Lovely. Why do I have to write a specific number of words! That is a dumb requirement.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Really a great book.  Loved it. Kept you interested.  Great story line.  Will read more by this author.  Great characters.
B00EHMFC78|4|One of his better books, enjoyed reading it.
B00TYB95I4|4|Good
B00IMYZL2S|5|This movie kept me interested.I like the super hero movies. Also I Love Chris Hemsworth, he is super duper dreamy.
0812550706|5|Not only did this book arrive way earlier than expected but it was in perfect condition :) If you are new to the sci-fi world or are purchasing this book as a gift, it is a wonderful story that any party will enjoy.
B003MOHX8S|5|I can't out do the already Epic comments made for this album,<br />but yes...it is very Epic. This is the magic that turns even<br />the worst of movies into the best trailers.
B00GRVV29E|5|Awesome and relaxing. While it's not really a game it is visually entertaining and the music is calming. My daughters both have downloaded it to their phones. It's not something to help kill time but when stressed it helps me take the edge off.
B007R41E8O|4|I like this game it has given me a lot of entertainment for 99 cents. Only 4 stars because sometimes the puzzles are too hard. The ending also kind of sucked, too sudden and didn't make a lot of sense.
B00M55C0LK|5|Decent size memory to start with
B000FP2OPY|5|The hit show Supernatural is worth it's weight in gold for the small price you will pay for the first season.  In my opinion once you start watching each episode it sort of becomes like Lay's potato chips;but this time you can't watch just one!
B00BEIYMIS|5|A movie that is well done.A scary movie without the blood and guts. The cast is strong . The writers were dead on with the script.
6301697707|5|Great take off on those old class B movies, my fav movie. No 2 is stupid, but this is great! LOVE IT! I RECOMEND IT!!! Rated pg-13 for violence/gore, adult content, brief nudity, and adult language. Not a bad movie! Kids at age of 9-anytime, will be allowed to watch it! I watched it at 6!
B005MLOKXA|5|I love this show. Ive been watching nonstop in my free time since i started watching 2 weeks ago. The cast of this show is amazing.
B0035LMTZA|5|The kind of movie that keeps you focus on every move they make. Suspense and Action is what I think about this awesome movie. You must watch!
B00C0W08XK|3|amazon error message when i try to sign in. other GameCircle apps work fine. otherwise a decent implementation.
B0083ZBW2Y|5|everything about this book is spectacular. it grips you and pulls you into the story starting with page one. it is so emotional
B00KFVE4B0|4|We like it.  Steve Buscemi makes a great gangster.
B0000DBJDM|5|i think this is an awesome dvd, specially for the fact that it's from an era when pink floyd were still that \\" elite\\" band in terms that they werent popular the way they became after dark side so that's make the dvd a great and really cool window to a very misterious and kinda unknown period of a great band. <br />The atmosfere created in songs like echoes ( part one must be one of the best stuff i ve' EVER heard in my life) careful with that axe, eugene and the rest of the stuff is just amazing, an undeniable display of good music from a band at his top!
B000MGUZMU|1|I can't wait until this current trend of music gives way to something else. It's boring and dreary. Next...
B000002PCS|5|One of my favorite movies, &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34; - the actors & music take us back in time to share a loving relationship, and the music sets the mood perfectly.
B0000AQS0F|5|Firefly is a lot of fun. The characters are interesting and well written. The dialogue is witty. The individual episode plots are entertaining within their own borders and also neatly capture tidbits of greater themes that weave through the whole series. Okay, I've hit the writing, check. I've hit on plot. Check. Oh, yes, the acting... what use is great writing if acted poorly? Rest assured the actors, all of them, do great work. You will enjoy visiting the setting of Firefly and its characters. Enjoyment. Entertainment. You've got nothing to lose in betting on this one.
B000ICL3KG|5|The scientific evidence for human-accelerated climate change has been laid out clearly over the past 30 years, each year becoming clearer. Gore has taken on the task of presenting the information to thousands of audiences around the world and this movie documents that. The film is not about political positions, which have only served to polarize this issue. This is a scientific phenomenon that some wish to ignore because of the myth that you can't be pro-environment and capitalist at the same time. I have a degree in Earth Science and the evidence for human-induced climate change seemed overwhelming as an undergraduate student 15 years ago, now we have clear effects rapidly materializing.     The film makes clear the moral responsibility to address our impacts on global warming, and that decision makers who continue to ignore or otherwise dismiss the issue are jeopordizing the balance in earth systems that permits life to thrive on this unique planet. There is hope, but we must act now. If you are not sure where to begin, start with this film. If you are one of the dwindling number of skeptics, please put your assumptions aside and watch this movie. We owe it to our offspring to do what is in our power to reduce our impacts on the atmosphere and preserve the ability of Earth to provide for intelligent life.
B000HA4WT8|5|This movie is off the hook and Its one of the best of the fast and the furious.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is the best for kids and also ME for a free game and not realalistick it is PERFECT
B008XG1X18|2|I am sure that this could be very interesting if it were actually active on my kindle.<br />I was dissappointed.
B00594XOZU|3|I love kik but it sucks because if your a pre teen or teenager it creates alot if stand with you and your friends
0525953094|3|disappointment
B0013A1T8I|5|I love this movie and the book series there amazing.
B005HV6Y84|5|NICE
B007PTJOV0|1|I agree that it is really fun but it is a waist of time. The controls work really bad. If you are not care full when you go to pause the game you can waist some if your amo. Adds come up as soon as you are done with a game and the next game goes really slow. Another thing that i dislike is that even if you jump on an enemy it will still waist one of your  life's. (Sometimes)also on  some of the levels you need amo to get past<br /> it. Rip off  of Mario.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|Superior graphics and plays like Gran Turismo. Must own for people who like to play racing games.
B000BQ7BX2|5|I bought this set on the strength of several glowing reviews on Amazon (British and American). ClassicsToday and Gramophone, although I already have the complete cycle several times over: by various conductors and orchestras (Haitink, Boulez, Chailly, Solti, Sieghart, Zander, Barshai, Kubelik, Levi, Levine, Rattle, Haenchen & Neumann) and the box sets by Edo de Waart on RCA/Cobra (good, but now out of print; if it's available it's rediculously over priced), Bernstein on DGG (no further blurb needed), Emil Tabakov on Cappricio (steer well clear of this one, it's dreadful really), Inbal on Brilliant (very good in some symphonies, listless in others) and Michael Gielen on H&auml;nssler (outstanding modernist view, a bit like Boulez, but less deliberate).<br />I relish this particular set because of the wonderfully warm sound quality (listen to those very deep basses in the \\"Alles Verg&auml;ngliche\\" chorus at the end of the 8th symphony), the non-prima donna singing of most vocal soloists, the generally faster pacing (as opposed to some of Haitink's snail like tempos; except in the ninth, where Bertini's finale is very much slower than most, but to great effect), the careful attention to detail and the generally unsentimental interpretation. The booklet comes with complete texts and full details about recording dates and locations.<br />One (very) minor point of criticism is that in order to cram all the music onto just eleven CDs, the various symphonies are sometimes strangely distributed over two discs and the chronology is interrupted. But musically a very worth while asset.<br />If you're looking for a complete Mahler set, this one should certainly deserve your consideration (with Gielen's a serious competitor; better: get them both).
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is really easy and hard at sometimes but is enjoyable for all ages! I hope this game is fun for you
B0031TZASY|4|I really enjoyed this book, but I'm a bit squeamish and skipped past some of the gory stuff. Loved the tiger and the animal descriptions (the sloth and meerkats).
B00G5G7EXY|5|Fast shipping, kids loved it
B00CAJDUX8|5|There are fan wars raging all over the blogosphere. Musicians, cell phone companies, box stores, automobile manufactures, political action committees, sneaker brands, etc, all have legions of fans whose sole purpose, it seems, is to ruin their competition and vice versa. It appears childish in nature, but because companies, musicians, and politicians have taken such a laisser faire approach to curtailing it, these people have become more and more embolden.<br /><br />Amazon, just a humble warning, you are ignoring this trend to your own peril.<br /><br />Having said all that, I am aware anonymous speech is protected by the 1st Amendment and therefore a legal conundrum.
B0054JZC6E|4|this game is really fun.....the only problem is that some of the games are hard to pass and some of them are pointless......over all a good game
B00BUP0IMY|5|I love this movie. I had to have it for my own collection. Brand new DVD that work great. Enjoy.
B00GQ6977Y|4|I felt that the first movie should have been named Hitgirl as Chloë Grace Moretz's character is just awesome in both.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character is still just a wannabe, but he did start to show some ability and maybe the next movie (if there is going to be one) he will start to earn the title of the movie. I am talking about the characters and not the acters as they all did excellent work. Rent, buy it, and just enjoy. :) Also press for a name change. :)
B007SGM084|5|A true love story, with much weird sex, only to find out that both of the major characters were in true love from the very beginning!
B00GP1ANXC|5|First I thought you can play but then I realized I can watch my favorite vids
B0054JZC6E|5|I bate that I accidentally deleted it and lost all my unlocked games and money and I keep getting my email bsck from support as undeliverable
B00MWD7XR6|1|Very biased - not how I remembered the 60's!  It had the feeling of two authors - one who wrote the gratituious sex scenes and shallow characters and the another who did some research. The first book was the best - but now I wonder how accurate that was.
B00004WKII|4|'South Saturn Delta' was the first disk of Hendrix rarities released by his sister and Eddie Kramer in their effort to restore the Hendrix catalog.  Here are four more disks in a similar vein.  While critics often scorned posthumous Hendrix releases after 'Cry of Love', most Hendrix fans could name tracks on those releases that were big favorites.  I would consider &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, and &quot;Message of Love&quot; essential Hendrix recordings.  Tracks I hadn't heard that really knocked me out include an early version of &quot;Little Wing&quot;, an instrumental early version of &quot;Bold as Love&quot; and a long blues improvisation &quot;Country Blues&quot;.  Nearly all the live tracks included in the set are of high quality, from the late 1966 show in Paris to 1970 Isle of Wight and Maui.  <br />Hendrix dabblers should stick to the &quot;Experience Hendrix&quot; set and serious listeners should have the three studio disks released while Jimi was alive plus the &quot;First Rays&quot; set.  But for those like me who think he may have dropped in from outer space this set is a must.  I'm docking it one star for including too many inferior soundalike alternate takes.  I don't mean to include several alternate early versions on the final disk, such as &quot;Astro Man&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot;, which are very different from the eventual releases.  <br />Of course the guitar playing is astonishing.  The man thought with his fingers and he's the most harmonically interesting guitar player I've ever heard in any genre.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Love this game.Would have given five stars but get frustrated by the short playing time.Would still recommend it though .

B00BB8SKPW|2|too much and prolonged nudity and the &#34;F&#34; word to serve any practical purpose in the film or storyline.

B00005JNEI|4|Michael Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" was one of the first documentary movies to take on the lies and evasions of the Bush Administration. It created enormous controversy earlier in 2004 when it was released. The DVD version, coming out just a month before the presidential election, is likely to exhume the same emotions that surfaced this spring.<br /><br />\\"Fahrenheit\\" is not a perfect movie. Moore's approach is to illustrate his points via stunts, not all of which work. Cornering US reps to get their kids to join to the military makes the point that reps are not terribly willing to put their own families on the line in the war on terror. But then, few Americans have had to sacrifice (yet) in this war. Though it has its moments of humor and absurdity, \\"Fahrenheit\\" is more frightening than funny; the stakes are too high. While it may be humorous to hear Congressman Charles Dingell \\"lecture\\" Moore about how our reps don't read the bills that come before them, it's pretty frightening that this is the case. The Patriot Act -- rushed through Congress with barely a reading and barely a debate -- being a case in point.<br /><br />That being said, Moore does provide us with well-executed (and frightening) snapshots of early-21st century America and its top leadership. Watching President Bush sit for 7 long minutes while reading \\"My Pet Goat\\" to a bunch of gradeschoolers said a lot about his purported leadership abilities. Witnessing the enormous protests in Washington at Bush's Inauguration made me wonder why I had not seen these images before. Seeing a mother, who had lost a son in Iraq, assailed in Washington, DC by a true Bush believer spoke volumes about the desire of many citizens to maintain their rosy view of Bush \\"values\\" and policies in the face of contrary evidence. Hearing American soldiers screaming in agony after an attack brought home the human cost of the war, which has been suppressed by our leaders. Listening to an Oregon State Trooper describing the budget cuts that have left a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Moore is a polemicist -- he is trying to influence the thinking of Americans who would rather not believe the duplicity and danger of the current administation. But being a polemicist doesn't make you a liar, as many of Moore's detractors would have us believe. \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" is an important addition to the currently muffled voice of protest and truth. Moore has done an exemplary job of bringing his point of view into public consciousness.a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.

B003UBTX72|5|I honestly loved this book. I read it in two days, I'm not normally a fan of autobiography's I feel they're often painted with rose colored pastels, but this autobiography is as raw and real as the author himself. To be honest, my main motivation for reading it was to see how hard he throws Mick under a bus. However, it never felt that way. If you have a brother, you will understand. There is true anger, true betrayals, yet at the end of the day there is love and respect. To learn the history of the Stones as well as KRs perception of that history, felt like a true honor. I have so much respect for the man, and I'm grateful he lived long enough to share his story so honestly and unapologetically.
B005LAZIRY|5|Opeth rules, this is one of my favorite albums from them, highly recommended, just A+ great tunes from start to finish
B00992CF6W|5|I love it!!! You get to build whatever you want!Also,you can have a pet a gift shop a science lab!For me it's a 10 star
0679809015|5|Great book! My 1 year old loves it!
068484267X|5|When this book first came out, i was quite reluctant to read it.  As I am  a native of Limerick City which is where McCourt is from.<br />However, once I  began to read the book.  I couldn't put it down.  Every scene in the book  was so well described, I could feel myself going back in time.  I enjoyed  the way each of the characters were portrayed.  However, cruel he was to  his Mother.<br />What appealed to me most about this book was the way in which  he described his school days in such an animated and fun way.  Its hard to  believe in parts that he is no longer a young man, long gone from his  native city.  I found myself laughing loudly as he described certain events  that happened at school.<br />All in all, this book is a great success for its  wit &amp; also for McCourts amazing ability to vividly remember his  childhood, even though it was not a happy one.
B003KUSUG8|5|I always like to wait awhile before I write a review to make sure I truly like it. After listening to this album now for two weeks straight, I realize how amazing it is. I liked it from the start and haven't even come close to growing tired of it. It is one of those albums you buy and can listen to for a month without listening to anything else. Not very many albums can do that. I feel like Eminem has been more honest with himself in some of these songs than he has ever been. He recognized the lack of quality in Encore. Although I don't think the album sucked, it definitely lacked the greatness of SSLP, MMLP, and the Eminem Show. Personally I don't know why he is so hard on himself for Relapse. I liked that album just as much as the first three. But it was nice to see him get serious for an album. Although he is still hilarious in his punch lines, there is more of an overall theme of seriousness. If he continues into going in this direction in future albums as well, I think the sky is the limit for him. Now a song by song rating:    1. Cold Wind Blows: 8/10 Good song, hilarious lines, loved having it on the album. But it felt like it should have been the second song on the album instead of the first. His true introduction is the second song so I felt like they should have been switched.    2. Talkin' 2 Myself: 10/10 Although Eminem is known to be brutally honest of other people and has let us into the problems of his life, I felt this song was great because Eminem was critical of himself. With as much crap as he talks on everyone, it's nice to see him show respect to Lil' Wayne, T.I., and Kanye. I'm not going to lie though, I would have loved to hear him rip Kanye for the Taylor Swift incident. Plus Kobe's part in it is great so that was a bonus.    3. On Fire: 6/10 One of the two songs I sometimes skip over. Not really a bad song but it felt it was out of place on the album. Just wasn't a favorite.    4. Won't Back Down: 9/10 I actually like this song a lot. I've noticed a lot of people disliking this song and one person saying \\"by far the worst song on the album.\\" I think that is pretty much BS. If you listen to what he is saying and coming up with, it really shows and brings out his talent. Plus the radio turn down and turn back up thing was awesome and original. I love that part. Clever lyrics with a good beat. Maybe some people just can't keep up with what he's saying.     5. W.T.P.: 6/10 The other song I sometimes skip over on the album. It's a pretty comical song but with as serious as the album is overall it was almost out of place. Maybe would have been better on Relapse and could have definitely seen it on Encore. But again it's not a bad song. I like some of what he says. Favorite line: You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car.    6. Going Through Changes: 10/10 One of my favorite songs on the album. I end up listening to this song a lot. He tends to do his best when he is most honest. I like the addition of Haley's voice. It's amazing. Enough said.    7. Not Afraid: 10/10 Great single for the concept of the album. Couldn't stop listening to this when it first came out a couple months ago. One of my favorite overall first singles for his albums. It's up there with My Name Is... and The Real Slim Shady. Not to mention it is his first serious first single which I think is good. It goes along with the idea that he isn't messing around anymore.    8. Seduction: 9/10 I seem to like this song a lot more than other people. It just seemed like a battle and I thought he really showed how he would destroy anyone who would challenge him. The line about the starstruck jaw stuck thing is great. I just thought this song was a good representation of how you don't want to mess with Eminem.    9. No Love: 8/10 I am not going to lie, I didn't like this song at first. This was the highly anticipated song with Lil' Wayne and I loved Drop the World. I was just looking for a faster beat. But the more I listen to it now the more I like it so I still feel like this song and I are getting to know each other.     10. Space Bound: 10/10 This is tied with being my favorite song on the album. I can listen to this song over and over again. I love the concept and the rhymes and the beat. It is just a well crafted song and has become one of my top Eminem songs overall.      11. Cinderella Man: 9/10 Great beat with great lyrics. There isn't anything I specifically want to talk about with this song but it is a great song. Another good representation how he's not messing around with his rhymes anymore.     12. 25 to Life: 10/10 This is the other song that is tied with being my favorite song on the album. Partly I feel like I connect a little with this song but I felt this was his best attempt at confronting Kim. The line \\"F you hip hop\\" trips me up so if anyone has any ideas please let me know. But just a great song in showing how Eminem has become an emotionally and mentally strong person. This song makes me respect him so much more than I already do.    13. So Bad: 9/10 I like this song but I see how some may say this is a filler song. I just like it personally so I'll give it a 9. I like the beat a lot. Nothing else to say about it but I like it    14. Almost Famous: 10/10 My favorite part about this song is the Ben Roethlisberger reference. Everyone knows what really happened and it shows how Eminem can still be serious while talking about current events. Good song    15. Love the Way You Lie: 10/10 This song brings out a lot of emotions and really illustrates the complications of relationships. I was excited to hear about the collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna and it met my expectations. Great song.    16. You're Never Over: 7/10 This is Eminem's true tribute to his best friend Proof. I didn't like this song as much as a lot of other people seem to. I respect the song and I like the lyrics, I just don't like Eminem's singing in the song. It kind of kills the rest of it and I get distractedby it. I wish he brought someone in to sing the hook or chorus or whatever he wanted. Maybe he just wanted it to be his own personal tribute without help, but I could have gone without the singing. But I'm not mad, even he knows he can't sing!    17. Untitled: 8/10 I like the song overall. Clever lines and well put together. I agree that it didn't need to be at the end but I mean honestly, its not as bad as some other misplaced songs. Like in Immortal Technique's long song \\"Dance with the Devil\\" where he has a little gap and keeps going. That was more unnecessary than this one. Good song, just could have gone somewhere else.    Definite songs to pay attention to: Space Bound, 25 to Life, Going Through Changes, and Love the Way You Lie
B003O86FMW|4|Collins does a masterful job of portraying the emotional currents experienced by the main character.  The empathy and relation the reader can feel for Katniss helps to enthrall readers in the plot, eagerly awaiting each new twist.  The complex symbols in the book help to entertain the most serious readers, but understanding those symbols is not necessary for the enjoyment of the book.  Collins also creates atmospheres very well; the confusion Katniss experiences at the end of the book is reflected fully in the reader's confusion.  Altogether, an excellently devised sequel that is hard to put down.
B002ZG98Z0|5|It was good size, very cute, well done and in very good condition. It was what was shown and I really loved it.
B00631VJIC|5|This compilation is as good as the show.  All songs are covers but all are really good renditions of great hits
B00003CXCT|5|Hi all! <br />  <br />I gotta share this! This is extrcated from an e-mail I sent out late 2004  <br /> <br />As I sit here, I am totally astounded... <br />  <br />I have just put in disk 1 of the 4 disk \\"Star Wars Original Trilogy'' box set, released in the UK yesterday Monday the 20th, namely \\"Star Wars - A New Hope\\", into my Pioneer DV575 player, and what appeared on my SHARP 32\\" (82cm) 16:9 flat screen has truly made my jaw drop! I have never seen DVD quality like this....NEVER!  <br />  <br />The colours, oh man...the colours! The clarity.....the sound.....the sound is so good I had to turn my system down! <br />  <br />\\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\"? Oh please! Sit down and shut-up! \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\"? Sit down and shut up!  <br />  <br />\\"A New Hope\\" looks like it was shot yesterday, let alone 1975! <br />  <br />I must admit that I am fortunate enough to have a system that allows for the maximum picture quality allowed by modern, current, conventional (Interlaced) systems, namely RGB (via SCART output / input) allowing for pretty much the optimum of the PAL spectrum, namely 625i resolution, which is pretty much just the next thing down from full-blown Progressive-Scan quality (625p) via Component output / input.  The result though, via interlaced RGB input, on my 16:9 flat screen, is distractingly good! The colours and resolution clarity of the picture that I'm witnessing is almost too much! <br />  <br />Even if, for whatever strange reason, you are not into \\"Star Wars\\" or have never seen the films (um..er...where have you been??), but you are at least a film fan, then do your self a huge favour, buy or at least rent this box set....do it, do it, do it!  <br />  <br />  <br />

B00005UKKF|5|We all know Britney can dance. We all know Britney can make excellent videos, and we all know she can't sing that well live, but it does not matter because the one thing Britney can do is put on an incredible show. Britneys at her best on her Dream Within a Dream Live From Vegas tour. From the opening Oops...I Did It Again she will have you hooked as she performs each and everyone of her hits. The choreography, staging, costumes, and special affects are breathtaking. I do widh she would sing live, but then a part of me doesn't. Its not about what she sounds like or even the songs themselves, its the perfect performance of them that matters. She is an entertainer and she soars at entertaining. Highlights include the funky Boys, Overprotected, and What Its Like To Be Me, The finale of Baby One More Time is the most sexually charged performance with Britney getting drenched as rain pours down on the stage. If anyone has not seen Britney live than you all must, but this concert will do just fine for the time being.
B0064MPXFA|5|Well constructed characters with believable personalities.  Story lines thread through all episodes and draw you on to see the next in the series.

B004U8VWLE|3|I felt with this film as I have with some of his other films, that he's trying to be fresh and avante garde but it doesn't quite feel authentic.  It felt like someone doing the hollywood formula version of being an independent film.
B000002UR7|4|Ten years later, it's so hard to believe that this is Radiohead.  This CD is more like classic rock, something you don't expect Radiohead to make.  In Pablo Honey, Radiohead have not still thrived enough to achieve their unique style.  Comparing to other rock CDs (by other bands), this album is quite good.  But if you compare this album with RADIOHEAD's later albums, this one is not as good as they are.  But it is necessary to listen to it in order to understand and enjoy Radiohead more.  When they made Pablo Honey, you wouldn't expect them to be one of the best alternative bands in the world.  It's quite amusing to listen to Pablo Honey in order to appreciate Radiohead's growth as a music band.  <br />i think Creep is overrated.  Even though its lyrics exemplify incongruity, rejection, and self-mockery, Creep is the one song that everyone remembers from this album.  Which does not do justice to the rest of the tracks.  There is Anyone Can Play Guitar, You, and other great songs that you have to remember.  <BR>You can see traces of similarity to Pablo Honey in The Bends.  But starting with OK Computer, each Radiohead's album has it's own style.  Each makes a particular entirety.  And that's what is fantastic about Radiohead: they're never the same.  <br />What is similar though is Tom Yorke's voice.  But that's also in its infancy in Pablo Honey!  Just compare it to Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box, or We Suck Young Blood... and you'll see how different he sounds.  <BR>The best thing about Pablo Honey is that it's the beginning: when we all started.

B00F91RYL8|3|If you like a good thriller this is it. Action, suspense, and thrills are here, the only thing missing is an R-rating!!! This movie is basically a Zombie Movie on Ritalin!!! No gore no blood no sense of death or fear of dread. You just kind of wanted to see more violence but Mr. Pitt kept it politically correct. I would have given it more stars if it was a little more graphic. Don't get me wrong I liked it but this could have been 100x better with an adult rating. Why is Hollywood going soft!!!
B00007LTIL|5|The point of these reviews is not to attack the artists (or the lifestyles of their fans), but to try to describe and/or objectively critique the music.  Yes, people are allowed their opinions, but an album such as American Beauty clearly is a classic folk-rock album, and to try to label it as a one-star piece of music just ain't right.  That being said, this album is one half of the pair with \\"Workingman's Dead\\" that appeared in 1970.  The Dead had already established themselves as a psychedelic bluesy jam-rock band, and had a loyal following.  However, they had not created much in the way of well-crafted songwriting until these two albums were recorded.  Basically, they fused together blues, country, boogie-woogie, traditional roots, and folk into a unique sound.  While Workingmans Dead may have more blues influence, this album leans a bit more towards folk and country.  Many of the songs are slow and introspective.  Please don't be scared away by reviewers who have some strange axe to grind -- trust the rest of us, and the fact that established music guides all rate this as a true classic.
B000QRIGLC|5|Started a little slow with the Navy SEAL training detail, but when it picks up shortly after that it really takes off.  An excellent read, gripping story and well written.

B006885LZM|5|This is once again Tom Hanks and Steven Speilburg doing their magic to bring the very real  story of the brave American Marines who faced the fanatical, and totally brainwashed Japanese soldiers who fought for their &#34;God on Earth&#34; and  would gladly have died to kill just one Marine for their Emperor.<br /><br /> But, in true tribute to their absolute devotion to his Country and his people , this  series also does shows how brave the Japanese were in battle. Almost every American vet would agree (except maybe the ones that were tortured, and of course those people, men, women, and children in occupied countries,  and the pain  these abused people suffered , ... well  they sure get a pass from me).<br /><br />This Japanese bravery is so unreal to most humans today, and the series does a good job of showing how dedicated they were to their cause. And, just to realize that the many of the thousands of Japaneses that fought in the madness, how few surrendered, unless very badly wounded, ...  so badly  they just could not fight back. Early on in the war the Marines learned to never take prisoners... because to try to do so could mean their very lives,and so why take a chance, when all they just wanted to do was come back home.<br /><br />This is a tribute to the Pacific side of land war  for an American in WWII, to complement their other two fantastic projects together showing the European side of the land war, &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; and the beautiful translation from the history book written by Stephen Ambrose into the so wonderful mini-series &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;.<br /><br />The first time I watched it I thought it was fantastic but maybe not quite as good as Band of Brothers, But I always watch great undertakings more than one time (and with Amazon Prime it is cheap and easy). The more I watched this mini-series the more I began to realize  just how good it truly is.<br /><br />For  people who have never experienced the absolute horrors and traumasthat mostly young veterans, fighting for their very lives, day after endless day sometimes, (and of course always, fighting for the lives of their buddies next to them) in  the living and weather conditions that can't even be imagined by most people (except in active war zones).<br /><br />This project was based on several books, all written by some of the Marines, the real people that are depicted through the series. And unlike the Band of Brothers series, this does a very touching job of showing the true human effects on the people who are exposed to the madness of an insane, total war. Very few people see the real cost of wars and even fewer live to tell about it. This is one more epic project by the Hanks/Spielburg team. Well worth watching..... many times.<br /><br />Most of all thanks to all of you American Service Members past and present. It is the only reason why America is still &#34;The Home of the Free and the Land of the Brave&#34;. Also, ... respects to the Japanese warriors, when they acted honorably.
0802130208|5|When I read the words \\"hunting cap,\\" I thought of Holden Caulfield, and that is what Ignatius Riley reminds me of. Ignatius is a keen observer of human life, and spares no words in voicing his literate opinion on everything. Everyone's got to listen, because like Holden, Ignatius is so smart he's got to be right about everything. Perhaps Ignatius is really Holden as a 30-year-old?  The star (or shall I say \\"ignored genius\\") of the story is Ignatius Riley; thirty years old, obese, gluttonous, messy, lazy, and with ten years of college under his belt (though it's not clear if he ever graduated). Now he's back at his mother's ramshackle house in New Orleans, lounging in his (filthy) room in his (filthy) nightshirt, writing endless raving on paper tablets. When he's not stinking up his room, he's wandering around 1960's New Orleans in his hunting cap, shouting his opinions on everything and making a nuisance of himself. Ignatius is a mad raving lunatic, but quite and amusing one.  What struck me as Ignatius' most marked characteristic is his habit of taking a job and ruining his employer, despite the fact that he's able to do well at work. He persuades his boss to let him come late to work every day, organizes the workers to hold a strike, then messes it all up at the end. He takes a job selling hot dogs, and then nearly ruins the entire business by eating them himself. May I add that by the end of the novel, his weight is ballooning to mega-proportions?  Confederacy of Dunces is a good title for the book. Ignatius is the type of person who's so convinced of his abilities that he regards everyone else as a fool. He's a lot like Holden Caulfield in that he's smart, but not practical. But while Holden had rich parents in Manhattan who subsidized his habits, Ignatius Riley has only his mother, living in poverty in New Orleans, with barely enough money to keep herself going. And did I say she spent her mother's life insurance policy sending her son to college for ten years?Did he do anything to repay her? Of course not! But then again, it's not easy for a genius like Ignatius Riley, especially when the people around him are nothing but a \\"Confederacy of Dunces.\\"
B00E8KLWB4|5|It's fun and challenging enough to keep my interest. I love mysteries and hidden objects. Must try.
B00BXDOSXS|5|Will play files that other video apps will not. I'm not sure if it's my file but I can't hear the movie. Sound is there, just too low to enjoy. I will try other files to see what the problem is but I like this app.
B002501AGG|5|almost bought a Polar 400SD which would have been roughly the same price. Instead, this watch has all the same features plus GPS (Providing you buy the foot pod as well for indoor use)    Easy to set up and mind blowing amount of data during your workout using scrolling pages of customizable data fields, suggest you download the instruction manual from Garmin before you buy to appreciate the features.    Not sure about the Garmin Connect web software yet, might be better if you could compare workouts somehow to plot progress (Maybe it can do that and I just haven't worked it out yet).    The is also \\"Garmin Training Centre\\" which is a non web based bit of software - not sure how this is set up but it might have added functionality.     I like the bezel interface which is a bit like an Ipod control, the heart rate monitor and USB ant. both sinc and work perfectly.    All in all an excellent piece of technology which I'm sure will help my motivation to keep fit.
1439153663|5|a great book.
B00004WC6J|5|a magnificent collection of golden songs from some other universe - where art takes precedence over commerce and true vision rules.<br />I have a slight problem with the packaging of this work. Everytime I open it the flimsy plastic center pieces designed to keep each cd in place, which broke apart, cause the cds to fumble around and possibly get scratched. The manufacturers should have the same standards that the music executives building homes in Malibu do! Provide us something that helps us better store our music.<br />Sylvian is an incredible musician/artist who should not be faulted. His catalogue is highly impressive and thoroughly satisfying.<br />Enjoy, but make sure you quickly preserve the songs before the packaging destroys them!
B00NO08SOI|5|I know I heard groans from people about this last season but I actually enjoyed it.  I like how it was switching from past to present to future, and the way they tied things together from previous season's episodes.  I did hear about the ending and it was always in the back of my mind but I think it was done well.
0316098337|4|A story narrated by a five year old boy who spends the first years of his life locked into a room with his mother, who was kidnapped as a 19 year old and locked in the room by the man named Old Nick who visits the room with supplies and Sunday treats but is hated by Ma and distrusted by Jack. They concoct an escape plan, which involves rolling Jack into a carpet and pretending he's dead. Jack will escape from Old Nick's brown truck on the way to his burial and run for freedom. It works and Jack and his Ma are freed, first going to a clinic and later to their own apartment where they enjoy their freedom in the Outside.       The story revolves around the love between a mother and child, with insights into the boy's awareness of the world from the confines of an isolated room and his perceptions of the outside world, first in the Room and later on the outside where he realizes people are real and not images on TV.       The boy has a vivid vocabulary for a five year old and Old Nick's crime is far fetched but the novel resonates with its depiction of Jack's conception of the world and his Ma's effort to protect it.

B000000OQF|4|Although Guns N' Roses are now looked upon in a different light now than in 1987, thanks to lead singer Axl Rose's nosedive into becoming a passive-aggressive, arrogant, self-centered, and childish ego monster, there was a time when the band made great music together.  Along with now-legendary guitarist Slash, Izzy Stradlin (guitar), Duff McKagen (bass), and original drummer Steve Adler, GN'R gave late-'80s hard rock a much-needed punch in the gut with their blistering debut album APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION.  Though it's not quite the classic that many repute it to be, it still stands head and shoulders above any of the mindless, faceless &quot;hair rock&quot; that was going on around that era.  If you looked at their pictures, GN'R looked just like another hair band, but their music was much more real, rawer, and in your face than those groups.  This sounds like something Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones would do in the '70s, not Poison or Ratt.<br />Everybody knows the singles &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Paradise City,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot; since they helped launch the album to multi-platinum mega-success.  Out of these three songs, &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot; still holds up the best and sounds great even today.  The same can't be said for the former two; too much radio airplay and MTV rotation have damaged those songs in my opinion.  What makes APPETITE a great record are the obscure album tracks.  My favorite song is &quot;My Michelle,&quot; a scorching riff monster that starts out very pretty like a Led Zeppelin tune but quickly turns into a menacing tale of a girl from the wrong side of the tracks.  Other riff-heavy and relentless rockers include the paranoid &quot;Out ta Get Me,&quot; the bluesy shuffle &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; (about a drug dealer), the very catchy and melodic &quot;Think About You,&quot; and the fierce closer &quot;Rocket Queen.&quot;<br />This album is definitely one to bang your head to since every songrocks hard from beginning to end, but it's not entirely great.  &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; &quot;You're Crazy,&quot; and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; are juvenile tunes that should've been scraped (ironically, the acoustic version of &quot;You're Crazy&quot; is surprisingly better), and &quot;Nightrain&quot; goes on for far too long, even for a 4 minute song.  Kudos though for producer Mike Clink and his mixing team, for which the album sounds raw and rugged like a '70s record, and not overly polished like most of the rock records were at the time.<br />Though not a perfect album, APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION did indeed bring the true essence back to rock &amp; roll and purified it for the next generation up until a certain point.  On a sidenote, Slash, Duff McKagen, and second GNR drummer Matt Sorum recently reunited this year and have teamed up with former STP frontman Scott Weiland to form a new band called Velvet Revolver.  They released their first song &quot;Set Me Free&quot; on the HULK soundtrack and will release their debut in 2004.  Be on the lookout for that.  Can't say the same for Axl, who's probably wallowing in his past.  Oh well...

B000063DI9|3|The first impression you get of a band is usually the one that sticks with you; the way they present themselves early in their career is what we can assume to be their preferred artistic style. I officially came onboard in 1983 after hearing 'Flight of Icarus' and thinking it was the greatest thing: heavy but melodic, with excellent musicians and great vocals. And I mean HEAVY. Fabulous. I was hooked. The liner notes to 'Piece of Mind' stated &quot;No synthesizers or Ulterior Motives.&quot; Great, I thought, these guys believe in true metal! Then came 'Powerslave', which was more of the same. Awesome! <BR>Suddenly, we get 'Somewhere in Time'. Hmmm....guitar synthesizers. I approached it with caution and found that, despite the muddy production, it still kicked some ass. The synthesizers weren't THAT intrusive, so I dealt with it. I was a little worried about 'Wasted Years' and it's overtly commercial tone, but Adrian's solo was so good that I quickly forgot my concerns. <BR>Then we get 7th Son. Hmmm...even more synthesizers....even more commercial songs...what happened to the guitars? I think I hear them but I'm not quite sure.....permy hair-dos....oh crap!!! This can't be! Fancy new stage outfits! AAAARRRGGGHHH!<BR><BR>The praise this album gets mystifies me. It represents Maiden at it's most commercial and most lightweight. For someone who got into them with Piece of Mind, thinking that was how they wanted to sound, this was a nightmare. It sounds nothing like their previous albums, and therefore sounds nothing like the style they became famous with, which is what attracted the original fans anyway. You don't get into a band thinking &quot;well this is good, but I hope they mellow out and get all prissy after a while.&quot; And all the arguments of &quot;progession!&quot; can't possibly mean that they should &quot;progress&quot; into radio-friendly music and lighten up their tone, can they? This album has very little musical progression, just musical softening.<BR>Storywise it's Steve Harris at his most pretentious. Of course, he thinks he's being clever because this album is the 7th album from the 7th line-up of the band or something, but must we be subjected to this barely intelligible concept of some mystical kid who will be, as far as I can tell, either the anti-christ or the new messiah, depending on which side converts him? More religious garbage. &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;...there he goes with more of his dream crap again. <BR>Musically it introduced his outlandish belief that beginning a song with a bass line (The Clairvoyant) was interesting to anyone other than himself. That technique hasn't worked since 'Wrathchild'. Sure, Adrian's true love for commercial songs had a lot to do with the poppy sound, but Steve's name is on both of those singles as well. If it hadn't been for Adrian and his superb compositional talents ('Icarus', 2 Minutes', '22 Acacia Ave.',' The Prisoner'), many of Maiden's best songs wouldn't exist, but Steve just put too much trust in him this time around. However, Adrian's solos are some of his finest here.<BR><BR>The production is dismal. Perhaps Martin Birch realized that the album's content did not deserve anything better. The guitars are pathetically low in the mix and have no clarity or definition, whilst the keyboards/synths are up front and blaring. Even with the cover art it was obvious that Derek Riggs didn't care much anymore, either. Maiden was hard pressed to design a stage production around that piece of insanity.<BR>The only songs I find myself attracted to are typically considered 'filler' by most fans. &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; has what I consider one of Dave's best guitar solos, and &quot;The Prophecy&quot; really stands out as an anomaly in Maiden's repertoire due to its blatantly classical chord progression and 'greensleeves-ish' harmony section. Now THAT's progressive. The rest of the album is progressO!

B00B2DGYQS|5|If `Yossi & Jagger` mesmerized with its passionate lovers caught short in war, then its long-awaited continuation, `Yossi` will charm with its sensitive portrayal of a man struggling to love once again.<br /><br />Years after his military service and traumatic loss, Yossi has become Dr. Yossi Guttmann, a serious, introspective cardiologist.  Withdrawn, bearded and pot-bellied, Dr. Guttmann lives for his work, completing his duties with a robotic efficiency.  Oblivious to the head nurse`s crush on him, he follows the lead of the charming Dr. Moti (an aging, yet ever-handsome Lior Ashkenazi) as the latter attempts to revive some life into him.  Moti suspects that his friend might be gay, but nonetheless sets him up with some female companionship.  This of course ends disastrously as Yossi finally determines to face the source of all his angst, his refusal to let go of his deceased lover.<br /><br />In a beautifully rendered scene, Dr. Guttman confronts Jagger`s parents and lets out the truth he has held inside for so long, that he and their son were lovers.  Ohad Knoller`s Yossi is a confused mess who wavers between emotional collapse and incoherency as he circuitously rambles towards his confession.<br /><br />Having unloaded his secret, Yossi struggles to start anew.  While he looks for connection in the all the wrong places,  with on-line porn and humiliating hook-ups, Yossi soon decides to escape from his failures to the barren, dangerous  wastes of the Sinai.  As fate or chance would have it, en route he picks up a group of young IDF conscripts headed for a holiday at the Red Sea resort of Eliat.  One of the four is Tom, a sexy, young gay man who takes an interest in the gloomy Dr. Guttmann. While Yossi hides under beach umbrellas (he skips on the Sinai) with Thomas Mann novellas, Tom does his best to pull Yossi into life.  And like an ice-block in the desert, Yossi melts quickly.  Their ensuing courtship unfolds in a sweet, funny and heart-warming manner.  Tom sees the beauty that lurks underneath Yossi`s bulging belly and stern, doctorial manner, while Yossi pushes himself to take a risk.  The result is a second-half that turns into a sweet story of rebirth that works despite its sugary optimism.<br /><br />The first half of `Yossi` is the better (and darker) half as the desperate Yossi threatens to slip into an abyss of despair and paralysis.  Yossi`s repressed pain and frustration are conveyed with his every sluggish movement and burdened glance.  Knoller`s Yossi perfectly captures the torpor of being caught in a whirlpool of your own making. You feel as if Yossi is slowly being trapped within his own labyrinth.  Even the cinematography expresses this with its chiaroscuro shadows and dark colors.<br /><br />The second half of the film beams light and levity.  Yet, Tom (the sexy Oz Zehavi) proves he has more to offer Yossi than just a delicious body.  Despite their crushy awkwardness, Zehavi and Knoller manage to keep it real.  You don`t know what will transpire between these two, but at least Dr. Guttman has returned to the living.<br /><br />`Yossi` is a tale of rebirth, old skin peeling off, the new peeking through.  Yeah, there`ll be a bad burn or two but Yossi`s deathly pallor is tanning quick.  The Fox/Uschovsky team has found a formula that works.  Their stories of difficult loves, impossible situations, and the men caught up in them carry a universal and lasting appeal.

B000002J09|5|This was the last Led Zeppelin Lp I purchased as a teenager who grew up when this music was being made.  My band played many of the songs on this record including the frequently lampooned Stairway to Heaven.  I got sick of friends asking me to play this Lp and one day I handed it to the person asking and said \\"here, keep it!  please!\\"  I went off and became something of a jazz snob.<br /><br />I hadn't heard the music on this disc in at least 30 years and then, after discovering the incredible Terry Reid, who had turned down the singing job that eventually went to Plant, I got curious about my hazey memory. After reading about Reid and his near miss with Zeppelin I started revisiting Led Zeppelin one disc at a time - see my other Zeppelin reviews.<br /><br />The music on this CD is really fantastic, every single track is brilliant.  I especially love The Battle of Evermore because it features the incredible voice of the late Sandy Denny who could warm your heart like a winter hearth or turn it to ice with a banshee moan.  What an amazing woman she was.<br /><br />It's kind of sad that Stairway to Heaven became so much fun to mock, it's such a wonderful piece of music and poetry.  Even Plant, in a Fresh Air interview, seems to have accepted the mockery (Hairway to Steven being his favorite) I must admit that I have vivid memories of working in a music store and got so fed up with kids coming in, pulling a guitar off the wall and playing the introduction.  This must have happened at least a half dozen times a day for a year or two.  We never had a \\"No Stairway to Heaven\\" sign but I wish I'd though of that!  I'm also eager to hear Zappa's band (The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life) cover Stairway.  I'm told a horn section cops the famous (and very good) Jimmy Page solo note-for-note.<br /><br />As far as a review goes, I'm not going to go into all of the tracks, others have done that and I just don't have the patience.  I will tell you that I'm still an active musician who usually listens to the likes of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.  I find this and most of the other Zeppelin releases were remastered with loving care.  If you're picking up the Zeppelin catalog I would start here, then move on to Physical Graffiti, Led Zeppelin III, Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin I, and Houses of the Holy (in that order).  I know nothing about the final two releases and I'm a tad wary of them.  Surely Physical Graffiti was the pinnacle of this band's accomplishments anyway.<br /><br />This was an exceptional band with extremely talented players.  The Runes album ranges from hard-rocking to mystical beauty. Some how it all fits together beautifully, nothing seems out of place (unlike the next release Houses of the Holy where the band seemed to lack a consistent focus) Hearing the Runes album after 30 some years was almost like discovering it for the very first time again :)  What fun!  The Runes album is a must have for any serious music collection.<br /><br />By the way, I listened to the backward masking of Stairway to Heaven.  People can hear anything they want to hear I guess.  It's like looking at clouds and picking out animals, people see different things in the same cloud.  Personally, after hearing the backward masking I believe all this Satan nonsense is just that, nonsense - someone heard what they wanted to hear and started a commotion.  Through the power of suggestion others can hear it too. But come on, the words from the backward masking are ridiculous and make no sense at all to a sane person.  \\"Satan kept us in a little shed.

038533348X|5|Vonnegut's dark comedy masterpiece is one of the best books I've ever read.  He successfully blends philosophy, science fiction, and humor to create an interesting and hilarious novel.  In my opinion, this is the best book Vonnegut wrote, which is saying a lot considering his other triumphs.  Anyone looking for a plot heavy book should probably look elsewhere.  Vonnegut's novels focus much more on the characters and their traits (flaws, many times).  This is a wonderful story about the nature of man and his tendencies towards destruction.  The ending (while trashed by many other reviewers - perhaps they didn't get it) is one of the funniest and most chilling things I have ever read.  This book is wonderful for its ability to make the reader look at oneself and laugh.  A must read.

B002MBAJ4M|4|Gov't Mule is one of the best live bands you will ever see.  Warren Haynes is unbelievable as a musician.  As a songwriter, he is good but not spectacular.  Hence, G Mule studio albums are not on par with their live shows or live albums.     This album is worth owning, and will be no surprise to fans of the band.  To me, Dose was their best studio album, and ever since the albums have all been strong but never stellar.  This one is the same.  I feel like some of the songs could have been left off (like from song 9 on).  Maybe it's just because by that point you've been listening to the album for an hour and it's enough already, but the quality of the last few songs seems to be a big drop off.

B0041B785Y|3|I guess I'll have to apologize in advance for not thinking that every album by my favorite Metal band of the last twelve years is perfect.  I was relatively late to the Meshuggah party, as Chaosphere was when I jumped on the train, and, to date, is still my favorite release (by the smallest of margins).  While DEI is an unbelievable record which possesses one of Metal's greatest tracks, Future Breed Machine, Chaosphere, in my opinion, was simply more consistent from start to finish.<br /><br />To give an idea of where my review is coming from, I should state that Nothing, while totally original in terms of direction, is my least favorite record from these guys.  The first twelve minutes of \\"I\\" is near-perfection.  While Catch 33 is a bold record that shows their songwriting ambition (the ethereal guitar sections are its best feature), it contains too much of Nothing's style of one-note riffing for my taste.  Obzen, in my opinion, was a fantastic amalgam of their post-DEI style.  I'm a huge fan of old-school Thrash, and Combustion was *exactly* the track I was waiting for Meshuggah to make; it's literally Thrash-done-Meshuggah-style.  In fact, I think Combustion ranks right up there with Future Breed Machine.  While the one-note riffs are still there, they incorporated more of Chaosphere's staccato muting, and, for me, the direction was perfect.<br /><br />That brings me to Koloss.  After about a dozen full listens, I think I have developed a sufficient enough opinion.  My expectations were *not* for the record to sound like another record; I just wanted to love it for whatever it is.  Unfortunately, I just *like* it.  It's pointless to mention production value, as Meshuggah know what it takes to make their records sound great, and it sounds as good as ever, here.<br /><br />\\"I Am Colossus\\" is a solid opener, and contains very straight-forward riffing (relative to Meshuggah).  I'm a sucker for triplet-based tracks with this feel, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Tomas was correct when he said that the two notes Frederik plays during the solo are all that was necessary to make it sound great.  The supporting rhythm riff during the solo is, to me, the standout section of this track.<br /><br />\\"The Demons Name Is Surveillance\\" is one of two fast/more driving tracks on the record, and, while its 6/8-double-bass feel is wonderfully played (does anyone really need to continue emphasizing how tight these guys are?), the notes/riffs just don't grab me.  The higher-note bends that are done during what might be called the second Meshuggah-chorus (which is never truly a chorus ;) just seem a bit gratuitous.  The solo isn't particularly noteworthy (no pun intended), as it's Thordendal's typical tapping, and it doesn't sound very inspired.  It sounds as if this track was trying to be the Koloss version of Bleed.  The endings are similar, but the exclamation point put on the end of Bleed is not even close to being matched, here.<br /><br />\\"Do Not Look Down\\" is what I believe a Nothing track *should* have sounded more like.  As a drummer, I love the fact that Haake's pocket is so deep.  Meshuggah isn't what I would call a \\"groove\\" band per se, but the fact that they have such a great pocket makes their brand of Metal that much more enjoyable.  The riffs themselves during this track just have a much freer/less-intentional feel to them, and the solo is one of the best that Thordendal's done in a while.  I love the effect that was added to the last few notes of it!  He took a break from the tapping and let all of us know, once again, that he can own with the traditional picking style.<br /><br />\\"Behind the Sun\\" doesn't grab me, at all.  While Meshuggah are quite capable of producing slow/brooding tunes that are effective, I don't feel that this is one of them.  It's usually a difficult task to make this type tune hold interest, and this one just doesn't quite do it.  I find myself listening *only* because it's Meshuggah playing it, and simply hearing well-played music is sometimes enough for me.  The second half of the tune is serviceable, but that's about it.<br /><br />\\"The Hurt That Finds You First\\", the first two-thirds of which is quite Thrashy, just didn't quite hit the mark until, strangely for me, the speed was over.  I quite enjoy the ambient/relaxed material these guys do, and the outro is nicely done.  Like TDNIS, I just didn't like the notes that they chose to go with the respective feels, and I really do believe that they could have done better.  Take a listen to \\"Terminal Illusions\\" or \\"Combustion\\", and you'll hear Thrash riffs that mean far more than anything played, here.  To me, this tune would be a really good Thrash tune for any other band, but, for Meshuggah, it's merely decent.<br /><br />\\"Marrow\\" is nothing more than a b-side/cutting-floor track from Nothing.  While my opinion may seem slanted because of the song's Nothing influence, I really don't think it would have even stood out if it were *on* Nothing. The only reason to listen the tune is because of Haake's excellent performance.<br /><br />\\"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\\" is one of two tunes that's grown on me since I starting listening to it.  This is slowness-done-right.  In context, the riffs really do work well with each other, and the parts never seem gratuitous.  This is a standout track on the record.<br /><br />\\"Swarm\\" is a track that, while solid and consistent with a good feel that they haven't done in years, just never quite takes off as anything special.  There are no riffs that really stand out.  This is yet another missed opportunity, and the ending is just plain lazy.<br /><br />\\"Demiurge\\" is the other tune that has started to grow on me.  In terms of feel, Meshuggah really hasn't ever done a track like this one, and that's why I really didn't know what to think, at first.  It's hard to describe the feel of what might be called Meshuggah-verses here, but it's almost a....rebellious feel?  I know that there's a better word for it, but I'm currently at a loss.  It sort of reminds me of the approach of \\"Up Lift\\" from Reinventing the Steel.  That said, while the majority of the tune is quite good, this is another case where I believe the outro should have been a little less lazy.<br /><br />\\"The Last Vigil\\" is a nice outro that fits quite well with the scheme of the record.  As has been pointed out, it has that Catch 33 feel to it, and the fact that Koloss ends this way isn't at all a detriment.<br /><br />My Standout Tracks:<br />I Am Colossus<br />Do Not Look Down<br />Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave it Motion<br />Demiurge<br /><br />I'm sorry for the levity, and I apologize if none of this was helpful/interesting.  I started typing and couldn't stop!  Meshuggah is one of the only bands that brings it out!<br /><br />Meshuggah have the luxury in that they have to *try* to make a bad album.  That hasn't happened here, but it could have been so much more.

B001A3GSFW|4|For the price it's a great buy. There's a couple of songs that could've been on this album that I feel were keft out. Other than that great album.
1401922732|5|Just love the cards. They are the real deal.
B004EPYZXK|1|This is 90 minutes of nothing. It's Blair Witch in space with alien rock spiders.<br /><br />The drama and suspense is manufactured. The dialogue is boring.<br />For a film about a secret mission it fails to convince you it's anything<br />at all. It's just a thin icing over the 'plot'.<br />The visuals are drab. The camera affects are blatantly fake.<br />The aliens are literally rocks that turn into spiders. They're not even<br />cool and you only get maybe 30 seconds of them in the entire film.<br /><br />The movie is essentially 85 minutes of boredom<br />and 2 minutes of action/story and it's not even good.<br /><br />The ending is completely devoid of tension despite the bad acting and attempt to<br />convince you otherwise.<br /><br />Not worth anyone's time.
006135323X|4|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and had quote it in conversation nearly daily as you see these behaviors play out. It is written well and goes quickly.  The authors blog isn't bad either.
0765326361|5|Truly the Stormlight Archive will be Brandon Sanderson's greatest work. The first two books in this series have been some of the best books I have ever read. And no I'm not using hyperbole. The Words of Radiance is just as good if not better than The Way of Kings. I wouldn't recommend this to just any reader as there needs to be some patience in reading them as they are lengthy but the reward comes when you are so invested in the characters that they feel real.
B00FATEJYE|5|Best game in the world guys if you get it the people of injustice will thank you trust me if you get it you will get things for free
B006GLLREU|3|Not as good as season 1.  Too much doom and gloom in the lives of the main characters.  I'm hooked on the show and plan to watch season 3.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Loving this show.
B0018OFN2W|2|If you are a male under the age of 20 you'll love this movie. 'Nuff said.
1451695195|5|as a retired RN, I have witnessed some amazing occurances during and at the end of life....something really does happen
B00006FDCD|5|Isn't this MOVIE in bluray!!!! Its a classic and it deserves to be in a bluray dvd! Now im just wasting characters because apparently I need 20 of them to publish this post
B0006LZPLM|4|I haven't gotten to use them yet.  They are for a Hawaii trip; however I'm looking forward to nothing but great things from them!!
B004LROUNG|5|Excellent one of the best, and very funny in places. I highly recommend ,
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Awesomeness
B00992CF6W|4|When I played online it was with herobrine and I got of the game quick and he disconnected me and I went back and herobrine took my stuff DO NOT PLAY ONLINE! IT COULD BE HEROBRINE!
B00E5Q1LTY|5|Great movie
B0031RAOVY|5|Very few movies make me cry. The CHAMP (1977) I think when the father dies and maybe one or tow other ones. But this one creeps up to you without notice. I did not really see much going on for a while other than a very adorable puppy. I watched this movie with my cat and by mid movie all I wanted to do is hug my cats and show them how much I love them for being so unconditional to me. It a timeless and very simple story and all can watch and learn from. Some basic human emotions that trancends to animals alike. It hard to keep it together toward the end as the story concentrates on the dog. I was speechless towards the end and could not stop sobbing. The kind of film that will stick with you and learn to appreciate the power of love and loyalty no matter whom or where it comes from. Highly, highly, highly recommend you watch, rent, buy, borrow this movie however you can find it and just pop it in alone, if you are to scared for other to see you open up to true emotion.
B00DR0PDNE|2|This sounds like a great idea, and it probably is...  IF it worked.<br />I was told after contacting Google that Chromecast didn't work with my router.  I use Verizon and it's hard to believe that with the size of their (Verizon's) system this router is not supported by Chromecast (Google).
B00000I49J|5|After the noise filled Pscychocandy comes the starkly lovely Darklands.  The JMC layers acoustic guitars with electric and brings off an album that is haunting and beautiful.
B009XIXVU6|5|Another amazing story by Khaled Hosseini. He has become one of my favorite authors and I eagerly await his next book.
B00005QW5X|5|Despite some really good films that came out late in the year (Lord of the Rings, Gosford Park), this tops my list for 2001.<br />John Cameron Mitchell has created a character that is fascinatingly complex and bizarre.  It's impossible not to get swept up in the story.  Stephen Trask has written songs that rock at one point, and turn touchingly poignant the next.  Mix in a lot of wild costumes and witty one-liners, and you've got an amazing film.<br />Funny, touching, impossible to get out of your head - all the marks of a wonderful movie!
B00P7PJ9P0|4|very pleased with this movie.  I was entertained and as someone who saw sleeping beauty way back in the day it was fun to see a new twist.  I think Angelina Jolie did a really nice job with the role. My wife suggested it and I am glad we did.
B00CB4ET0K|5|Better than frontline
B009IU6BIS|5|Every year classic finally fell of Prime - no problem - BUY IT!
B00005O5CM|5|I LIKE THIS MOVIE. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE CLUELESS. I LIKED CLUELESS A WHOLE LOT. BUT, ELLE SHOWS WARREN SHE DOESNT'T NEED HIM. I WAS SO GLAD WHEN SHE HAD TURNED HIM DOWN. SHE WON THAT CASE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HIS FIANCE HAD BROKEN UP WITH HIM. THE VANDERBILT. WARREN WAS STUPID FROM THE BEGINNING ANYWAY; WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MARRY SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR LAST NAME. SHE SHOWED HER BEAUTY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE WAY TO GO!!!!
B00M2Y6VTG|5|Very good game, pure strategy, Long time did no see a game like this.
B00005JNQS|4|I watched this movie several times with my son. We both enjoyed the movie. It is worth watching with your wee tribe.
B007HJ8UAO|5|Sexy as hell
B00992CF6W|5|this game is so fun...I play it every day.who ever has a spare 7 bucks......you need to buy minecraft.I have it for the xbox Pc and kindle fire.this game is EPIK
B0014Z4OQG|1|One of the worst movies I've seen in some time. Other than some cool action and all the insufferable main characters dying, there is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever. There's certainly no point or meaning despite what wanna-be critics and fanboys will try to tell you. Void of any legitimate thrills or even remote sense of terror. A poorly conceived mess with laughable dialogue, awful acting, completely unlikeable morons and way too many utter absurdities to even go into. Sounds like a review of Lost. See it only if you're really bored and want to watch a few entertaining minutes of monster destruction (which are unfortunately the most realistic parts of the movie).
B00B2V66VS|5|never the same game twice. lots of great game play. a super game and must have! very addictive and great graphics.
B000003TA4|5|This album is just fantastic! It was really kind of a shock when I first heard Cobain's voice- strong and hmm very original... each song has it's own climate- famous Smells Like Teen Spirit, silent Polly next to loud Territorial Pissings, also silent and relly nice SOmething in the Way close to Endless Nameless, although seperated with 10 minutes silence. I don't think I will ever listen to such a good part of music. Each time I listen to this album I have this nice feeling of listening f something really good, oryiginal and honest!
B00008L3U1|5|A+
B004MC8CA2|5|very nice, does what it says, I enjoy using this come in handy will tell everyone about it, keep up the good work
B00L9B7IKE|3|I probably would have enjoyed this more were it not for the countless &#34;NEXT GONE GIRL&#34; and &#34;HITCHCOCKIAN&#34; promises thrown around in countless reviews. I kept waiting for a twist that never came, and I was disappointed. An ok book, but nothing special ...and certainly no Gone Girl.
B008K6HN8I|4|Still not used the full potential of this product.  I do enjoy the ability to control the files etc.  See comment on the Dolphin Browser.
1451695187|1|I am a Christian.  This book contradicts the teachings of the Bible regarding Heaven.  There is only one way to Heaven and that is through Jesus Christ.
B0095ZMMCK|4|What can I say, I just get lost in Clancy's stories. What more can one ask? And there are echoes of truth in the  cyberwar theme
B00CYQXGMW|5|No review needed.  I own all 5 seasons.
B008TTPQXA|4|I truly enjoyed this book on so many levels. I loved the way it was written and the author's amazing ability to capture a concept or idea in a way that I could relate to, understand and visualize.  The author takes you through his journey, his thought processes and not only opens his heart but also reveals a glimpse of his true self in this very delicate, mysterious, wondrous discovery. I suspect  this NDE will continue to inspire and touch many, and more importantly finally give hope to a jaded and lost generation.
B00HDMMISA|5|Book club book and I found I could not stop reading, had to find out more. A must on you summer reading list!
B00LEIT6K2|5|One of the best games I have played. Worked really well on my Kindle Fire. Better story than most, great graphics, good puzzles. Will look out for more from Artifex Mundi.
0060765488|5|This book is very fascinating. It has you see the creativity and imagination of people such as the author, C.S. Lewis and the amazing world that we live in. I think it will keep everyone who reads it interested in it. Animal lovers would definitely like this due to all of the animals in this book. Also people who like mysterious action movies would also like this book because it keeps you on your toes and there are wars and many conflicts. I would definitely recommend this book for other readers.
B00E8KLWB4|5|love it! easy to do and play. so fun even my step daughter plays it along with me on facebook and on here as well.
B004S49YVU|4|Aniother great read from the author. for me thiis book holds my attention throughout,i  recommend this book to all your readers.

B000009ED0|4|This is not the beatles \\"white album\\" Its fun humor rock. Its a new category look for it a the record store. Anyways have a good time with it. Love it or leave it. But, take it for what its worth....sittin behind the garage smokin a blunt...If thats your deal you might enjoy this album. If you sit at a desk  pushing pens all day....stick with the elevator music..
B00B2V66VS|5|Got this game a few days ago  and haven't stopped playing it yet (except to write this review, of course). I definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B0050DIWFC|4|There are so many issues here to ponder,moral,legal,soul searching. What would you do when faced with this? I was thinking one thing only to be surprised by the turn of events and then again! Stunning.
B000XUBFE2|5|I enjoy this book from beginning to the end.  It was truly amazine, the relationship between this father and daughter was so wonderful I cried when her family died. After reading the book I rented the movie.
1432794426|5|I have read just about every book that I can get my hands on about Michael and this is by far the best book out there.  So much information that we, his fans are looking for not the usual few nice comments and then the nasty, vicous things that have been written.  Just the good things that we want to hear.  I had the opportunity to borrow my friends copy of this book and i loved it, so I in turn bought my own copy and wlll probably read it again and again.  Loved it.  Thanks Karen for loving our King.
B00AEBBA36|5|Exceptional. Very realistic.    Be advised: Lots of killing in a film about a real battle where many brave men - on both sides - were killed. Grueling and hard to watch at times, due to the sheer gruesomeness of the battle scenes.    This movie truly seems to capture the horror and utter chaos of this historic battle of the Viet Nam war. There is actually real film available from this battle, as well as the best-selling book, not to mention those brave men who were there and lived to tell about it. This film seems to be a reasonably faithful version of what really happened - at least from the American standpoint.    So, if you think this is just a valentine to the American military with little basis in fact, you are mistaken, as the VC are portrayed as courageous and competent fighters. Truth is stranger than fiction, and no make-believe Hollywood story has anything on We Were Soldiers. This fight really took place, with both sides taking extremely heavy losses.    Yes, it is quite gory, but certainly no less so than the actual battle must have been. With so many bullets and bombs flying around in such close quarters, it had to have been hell on earth.    These men were astoundingly brave and their story deserves to be told. Such amazing courage needs to be remembered, and such profound sacrifice should not be sugarcoated.    I honestly cannot fathom why any viewer would give this film less than three stars. Perhaps some people are just so opposed to violence in general, or the Viet Nam war in particular, that they dislike any film portraying our military in an even a vaguely honorable light. I personally feel the war was a waste, yet I still think the world of those men and women who were brave enough to go and fight it, not because they wanted to, but because they had to. To any and all remaining survivors of this battle, you have my utmost admiration.    A truly emotional film. A real story that every American interested in history should be made aware of.
B0040YFR1Y|5|Look, it is not really a FIVE Star film. Compared to the AVP ones it is, but it is really a solid 3.75 Star Film, but the fact that some people feel compelled to give it only a single star is Absurd and forced my equally absurd higher rating of FIVE.  If you liked the original, you can't help but like this one, as it is more of the same.  I loved the homages to the Original, and it was entertaining.  If you didn't like the original movie don't bother watching this one.  With that said, it was a good movie.
B00DMCV7K0|4|The success of translating history into compelling narrative story depends upon the subject character and her culture. Kidd works with a repressed difficult period in American history and does a decent job enlivening the Grimke women. However, I agree with other reviewers that her slave women, born of imagination, rather than flesh and blood greater capture my attention and &#34;heart&#34;. This is curious...our creative selves can conjure greater authenticity than our documentary/fact finding selves? Rated the book four stars for solid writing, research, and effort to teach audiences about the beginnings of abolition and the fight for women's/equal rights.
1582701709|5|I have this book as a soft copy but wanted the hard copy for reference I am also going to give to my mum to see if it can help her
B000003CUJ|2|Should you want an abstract from Ring, take Great Scenes Solti one CD form, with voices. Should you hate voices and search a wordless synthesis, this would not be te best choice. Please read my review to \\"The Ring,an orchestral adventure\\", where Vlieger (well conducted by Jarvi) shows a  mutilated unforgivable shape as Maazel does here. I agree with Alexander Arsov 1 star review.<br /> Both \\"finales\\" of Rheingold and Die Walkure are missing, although label includes \\"Entry of the Gods\\" and \\"Wotans farewell\\"<br />  Flavio J Morsch<br />  Brazil
B00DC7N9NS|4|I guess I went into the movie with some preconceived notions about what it would be like—which I try not to do—but the film still surprised me! It was very cool to get an inside look at how the Wizard came to be, and the relationships that he formed along the way. The cast did very well—especially Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West!! Overall, the film was a fun ride and I would watch it again. Family friendly. Good stuff!
B00DR0PDNE|5|It works perfectly. I am so happy with my new &#34;toy&#34;.
B00DDPZIUG|5|Always totally absorbing and interesting.  A fabulous read.
B007SOQBCM|5|It is almost like youtube but u can find live streams easily
B00004TDTO|5|At long last, Jaws on DVD. Why did it take so long? I have watched the VHS version many times and always marvel at how poorly a really good picture can be transferred to tape. DVD makes all the difference in the world. <br />I  needn't go into how good the movie is. We all know that. But the DVD is  GREAT!
B003UAHIM0|5|Best comedy ever!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|5|again
0316236535|4|I bought this book for my neice after having it requested over and over by several preschool students I work with.  Kids love watching the monster come together and apart part by part.  Seems to be all kids love it!
B000X4GXT0|5|romeo and Juliet is one of my all time favorites, the music and the cinematography are beautiful. wonderful movie -
B000FC2L1Y|5|I just love the Outlander book series by Diana Gabaldon.  I love Clair and Jamie can't wait to see what's next in their life.
B007SGM084|2|If you are a guy and want to read this be careful you may get bored out of your mind. Is made in a woman perspective which makes it less attractive for man.<br />However, I can say that even that the book is in a woman perspective it can still be good if it had a better plot.<br />The story is boring and without major conflicts which makes it emotionless and unrealistic.<br />.
B00GEEB730|5|This is a different book. Not the usual story line, characters or drama. It is great to read something that is not cookie cutter.<br />Try it.
0446608955|4|A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, is a story about two high school students who find love despite their opposing personalities and upbringings. Jamie Sullivan is the minister's daughter and is shy and conservative, while Landon Carter is a rebellious teenager who desperately tries to be \\"cool\\" and fit in. The two students meet in rehearsal for the school play, and they slowly begin to fall in love with one another. It wasn't until Jamie confesses to Landon that she has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, Leukemia, that the struggles in their relationship emerge; it is a true test of their love.  <br />The reason I chose to read A Walk to Remember is because I heard great things about the book and I enjoy reading about love and romance. I truly enjoyed reading it, but at points it was a little TOO sad for my taste. I think Sparks did an incredible job with his characterization; as a result, I could precisely envision the Bible-toting Jamie and the typical teen rebel Landon. I read this book in only two days because I could not put it down! I thought, though sad, it was extremely entertaining and hopeful for those who believe in love and companionship.
B004RLO0EA|5|Love the whole soundtrack.
B00EPFEY44|5|The CD, and DVD, brought back so many wonderful memories for me. the rhythm of the music, the beach side venue.  It has changed since the 60's, but my memories haven't. It was a lovely trip back in time.
B005NA3B8U|5|This is a great port of r type. Love it. Controls are great. Got the two different options of either arrows out relative touch controls. Works great
B008IJTFYW|5|This. is a great app to get sometimes I pretend I play in the woods with the sounds.It puts me to sleep easy to.
B005Q1W10A|4|This is a good series, it reminds me of the need to know the law where tax and usurpation of property rights is concerned.  If you want to know how to never have to pay tax, and control your property drop me line, slcgtuttle@gmail.com You will be amazed at what you weren't taught in school.
B00AZMFK3K|5|jj abrams has done it again, don't care what anybody has to say this movie has it all, and then some more..........and more. abrams has done one heck of a job with this.......just came back from seeing it with the family (all 6) everyone loved it......i have seen a good deal of movies over the years but, i  would rather see them at home.  this is one of the very very fue movies i have seen that i can say i enjoyed in the theater. can't see how anyone can say that abrams has lost his touch.  the second this movies ended i turned to my wife and said...i'm ready for part 3, i can't wait for the dvd (as soon as possible) (next week i hope) lets see its may that means oct. CAN'T WAIT........the sooner they get this on dvd/bluray the better.  if you liked the last film i really can't see why you would not like this. from my hole family its a++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ thanks jj you are one heck of a writer and director.  can't wait to see what you do with star wars.
149539090X|5|Bree Prescott arrives at the little lakeside town of Pelion, Maine and hopes that the tiny town will help her finally receive peace that she so desperately seeks. Day one she meets Archer Hale, an isolated man who holds his own pain tight against him like a shield. No one bothers Archer mainly because no one knows him. As day goes by Archer and Bree begin a friendship that turns into something more healing one another.<br /><br />Archer's Voice was the first book I read of Mia Sheridan and I must say it was beautiful. Mia puts all her emotions into her characters that her words make you feel every ounce of the love, pain, heartbreak, and love. She grabs you by the heart strings and doesn't let go until you finish...which for me I couldn't put the story down I had to finish to the very end. All I can say is it hits you right in the feels and leaves you laying on the floor. :)
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Just Awesomeness
B00DSY8D36|2|I like a lot of the features. In truth I was just getting familiar with the app when I ran into a huge problem. It won't run without internet access. Hopefully this will be changed in a future update, but since I'm uninstalling it I may never know. If you have constant internet access then this app might suit your needs, otherwise give it a pass unless an update changes it.
B0050DIWFC|5|Loved this novel!  Couldn't put it down! I read it in just 2 days.
B006671NPM|4|The movie itself is great. seeing this saga come to an end is quite sad. so far as the 3D conversion, they did an okay job but it looks like they got the parallax a bit off on the conversion leaving very little popping out of the screen... it's okay if all you care about is depth but unless you have a bluray player with parallax adjustment or playback software that allows you to adjust it you will never see the eye popping 3D that many of us have come accostomed to with many of the 3D films currently available.    how i rate this movie on a scale of 1 to 10-  storyline, cast interaction and overall film - 10  3D - 4.5
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Best show ever
B0004Z33F0|5|This ia an awesome movie. stallone revives his role as rambo in this third installment of the series. rambo 3 is just as good as the first two. stallone doese a great job at this character. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004K4IZ3G|5|This is one of my favorite movies and I am happy to have it on BluRay so I can watch it in full 1080p.
1439152799|5|The Forgotten Garden was one of my favorite books, and The Distant Hours does not disappoint!  I would definitely recommend this book.  The plot interweaves the stories of several characters over several generations, and does it easily, just as in The Forgotten Garden.  Kate Morton has such a wonderful way with words, and the characters feel very real.  Just relax and let the book take you--it's a delicious escape and satisfying read.  Can't wait for the next one, Kate!
0823015017|4|The experiences shared by these two artists is exceptional and they have succeeded in meeting the challenge of transferring what they have learned into a book that can easily be understood by their readers, a daunting undertaking indeed! It has certainly made me much more aware of colour combinations but I am not sure I will follow their detailed path in my efforts as I tend to enjoy a much more serendipitous journey. A good reference book to have in any library though.
B0099Y2MYK|5|Awesome series wished they would get 4 out already.  UK is on season 6 already why does US wait so dang it long :)
B007D2XSW0|4|Test devices:<br />Samsung Epic, Cyanogen 9 beta 3 (Android 4)<br />Viewsonic gTablet, TeamDRH ICS 1.2 (Android 4)<br /><br />Given that one of primary uses of smartphones is taking pictures, it's no wonder why there are so many different pic editors on the market.  Having dug into several dozen, I can say that not one of them is perfect, each lacking something here or there, some feature(s) that another one has, isn't as easy to use, etc.  Though I keep two different editors installed, my default goto editor has been [[ASIN:B004OZK9VW PicSay Pro]], which is what I'll be using as a comparison in this review.  In terms of cost, PicShop and PicSay Pro are pretty close, with just a dollar separating them.  Both have free trial versions, so you can have a chance to check them out before plopping down your cash.<br /><br />As expected, I found a lot of things with PicShop that weren't up to the caliber of PicSay Pro, and PicSay Pro lacked some of the features of PicShop.  You can share right from your gallery into PicSay Pro, but not PicShop.  Exporting pictures is quite limited with PicShop, with only exporting to your device, Twitter, or Facebook.  PicSay Pro on the other hand can also export to anything you can normally share to on your device, plus set as image for a contact or set as your wallpaper.  PicSay Pro also lets you save the image locally where you want and under any name you want, while PicShop saves in the same location as the original photo under whatever name it chooses.  It's not all bad for PicShop though.  It can save in more formats automatically, upscaling your image on its own when needed.  Resaving an edited image results in a new file with a new name, so the original isn't overwritten.  In PicSay Pro, you have to set the new name manually.  Filters, effects, and additional features again goes it PicSay Pro, which has a much larger set of these.  PicShop fights back though with the ability to layer images, and use frames on your final output.  The UI for both apps is pretty easy to use, though they differ significantly.  PicShop may win this argument by a smidgen, because of it's larger buttons, sliders, and filter previews.<br /><br />So far, not a single issue with performance of PicShop.  It worked well, and at my slightest touch.  Stability has been excellent as well.  While I'm not ready to give up on PicSay Pro, I'll be keeping PicShop around as my new backup editor.<br /><br />*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse. Please note the date of this review, as it may contain info that is no longer accurate.*e UI for both apps is pretty easy to use, though they differ significantly.

193700788X|5|Good read excellent mystery great author
B005LAIHYU|2|The book was excellent; the movie was so far from the book that it isn't even worth comparing the two. The fact that the screenplay was written by the author of the book that the movie is &#34;based&#34; off of makes it even worse. If you read the book and are looking to see the movie because you liked the book, then don't watch it. If you haven't read the book and are looking for an action movie with a weird premise, then you may find it hard to keep up with the plot, but does that really matter in an action movie?
B00L8O7KW8|2|Not even close to the original 300.  Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B0002WZTOI|5|Good story.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|I purchased this game for my granddaughter and I find myself playing it.  It is fun and easy to play.
B00KJFZZLU|5|I've always enjoyed RT's solo shows the most, and this CD is an excellent in-studio representation of acoustic set staples. For those who like this I'd also recommend 1998's Celtschmertz and 2004's The Chrono Show. Both are self-released sets of live acoustic shows, and both also feature Teddy Thompson joining RT on a handful of songs. Though there is a bit of duplication in the track lists across the three CDs, each has its own highlights and each includes many songs not found on the others. For example, Celtschmertz has the best version of When the Spell is Broken that I have heard (better than the one on Acoustic Classics IMHO), and the Chrono Show has a great coming of age song entitled Watch Me Go, that I have never seen elsewhere, as well as a great cover of Dylan's Jack of Diamonds.
B004SJ3AXI|5|Got this for my grandson and he has really enjoyed it.  Waiting for the &#34;new&#34; to wear off so Grandpa can try it.
B000058983|3|I know this album is praised far &amp; wide, but I personally found it a difficult &amp; not too rewarding listen. I've always loved &quot;Alone Again Or&quot;, a magnificent single by any standards, and its flip side, &quot;A House is not a motel&quot; is a compelling track as well. But the rest of this CD just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe I was expecting more music like those first two tracks. I just found most of the rest of it too oblique and weird. A couple of the bonus tracks are interesting, such as &quot;Wonder People&quot;, but I don't know why they claim the extra version of &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; as the single version, which it is not. I have the original single and this is not it. Perhaps it is the promotional 45 version. It is also referred to as an &quot;alternate mix&quot;. So much confusion. Much like this album. There is absolutely no mention of Arthur Lee's incarceration, or the fact that this project did not receive his endorsement. Maybe if the Rhino people were less inclined to pat themselves on the back for issuing this &amp; more inclined to give us the facts, we would all be better off.

B0031F0DVC|5|Amazing film, never gets old. Great plot, great cinematography, and overall perfect. Watch the subbed version, the dub is eh.
B000001TVD|5|From the days I first heard the title song while in college (76-80), I have never forgotten this album.  I spent years trying to locate the vinyl and finally did, although the CD was impossible to locate; I wasn't even sure it had made it to CD format.  Now, thanks to Amazon.com, I see it has.  Anyone who enjoys Hendrix and other related guitar-Gods should listen to this with headphones and prepare to be blown away!
B003ASLJQS|5|Dennis Lahane is a masterful writer.  He lived much of what he wrote about and he tells it in a fresh and magical style. He is a writer who carefully hones his words and loves his characters, warts and anything else ugly, and all. He brings Boston to light as it really is and his characters fit in so well-- they ARE the people of the south side of the city.  The film was as good as the book, which is hard to do most of the time. Lahane had to have a hand in the film, I'm sure.  This is a novel to purchase because it is an example of a perfect novel. He does it all.  (This novel is right up there with Stuart O'Nan's Prayer for the Dying. If you have not read that one, please do so.) Excellently done, Dennis!
B00P7PJ9P0|5|Excellent movie. Beautiful graphics. I had not wanted to see this movie but my 15 year old daughter talked me into it. She loved it as did my husband and myself.
B00005QZWI|5|This soundtrack is incredible! When I saw the movie for the first time, the part where the Fellowship is climbing over the mountain after they had just departed Rivendell, and the music is climbing towards the climax, that's when I knew I would buy this soundtrack. It has a very peaceful and happy theme at the beginning (Concerning Hobbits) that turns to an intense and choral theme (A Knife in the Dark) and becomes very heroic and powerful as the music demonstrates good vs. evil in The Bridge of Kazad-Dum! I LOVE the brass (as I am a hornist myself) Words cannot describe the power of music!

B000FCKGPC|3|Getting to drag.  Too much info on the side - not that interesting. I am getting turned off of this series.
B005IQZB14|5|I love this book.  As soon as it came out I knew I wanted to read it.  I just ate it up!!  couldn't put it down!  I'm familiar with the country she writes about and I felt like I was on the trip with her.  I usually pass on the books once I've read them, for me, this ones a keeper.
B001ANSS5K|5|I have read of your books, John. Of all the female characters that play a main role Margo is the one that made me think the most.<br />The truth behind her paper town and paper girl mysteries made me question whether there is really a person out there that isn't a 'paper person'. Paper towns are the ones that are secluded and hidden, so I think. But paper people to me are the ones that differentiate themselves in their own ways. And to me that is basically the same thing as being a person.<br /><br />This book was written in an interesting way that captivated me even more. I plan on reading it many more times and reading much more of your works John.<br /><br />DFTBA,<br /><br />a fellow nerdfighter.
1476729093|4|The characterization and writing were excellent. It was an easy read, and a very enjoyable one.
B00000JFV9|5|Dope album
B00KK0PICK|3|I made it halfway through the book before I lost interest. Although the tone of the book is almost endearing, it is also slightly off-putting and intense. Are you ready to have a heart to heart with inanimate objects and have the spare time to purge your house all at once? Then this is for you.
B001KWTBVQ|5|I still love watching this movie after having seen it several times.  Romantic and sweet.
0618680004|5|While I partially agree with one reviewer who said Dawkins' book was preaching to the choir, I think that it can serve as a very valuable tool for those agnostics out there who can't decide if there is a god or not, or who have decided to take Pascal's wager.  Dawkins clearly  refutes practically all arguments for belief in a supernatural being, including two of the favorites, consolation and inspiration.  Of course, like another reviewer, I can't really see any devout devotee of a religion reading this without a gun to his/her head, because those people are already convinced that they are right, or are simply unwilling to consider the possibility of other realities. <br /> <br />The book was very readible and entertaining and is a worthwhile addition to any critical thinker's library.
B005LAIIS0|4|It was good, and I always like Liam Neeson.  I didn't like that last part but I won 't say more so I don't spoil it for someone.
B00G5G7K7O|5|What's not to love come on!  It is wonderful and cute and funny.  If you love animation, singing, and funny Reindeer you will love it!
B00AYLTMMM|5|Such a GOOD Movie! I highly recommend this.  This deserves more than 5 stars.  Helen Hunt is great, and William H. Macy, there are no words! LOL.....Watch it, BUY it.
