B008L0DPE4|5|purchased this for my 2012 Kawasaki Ninja 650R which was whisper quiet and cars wouldn't know I was beside them and it was dangerous. So I brought this and now everyone knows when Iam coming. I love the sound quality and the backfire pops when I come off the throttle.
B004RGOS24|5|Cleans my BMW dakota leather really well. I like how its water based and light on the leather.
B005RJ3GBE|5|It's advertised as not including the little VW emblem but those are near impossible to find by themselves that aren't just a decal, that's my only real gripe.  Other than that this is of OEM quality and looks and feels just like a new one for a fraction of the price.<br /> Transferring your old key fob components is rather easy EXCEPT for removing the RFID chip in your original key(s)!  It's about the size of a grain of rice and mine was apparently just as delicate:/  Even being super careful, I broke a little tiny chunk off of the chip and my car was rendered immobile. I Had to call the dealership for a tow and it'll take them a couple days and couple hundred dollars to remedy this.<br />  I'm somewhat handy with small electronics but this is a very delicate component and shouldn't be attempted by a novice.
B000CSQBPS|5|Don't know how long this sensor will last; I've only installed it twenty-four hour ago. It was in my hands and installed in les that forty-eight hours thanks the Amazon Prime two-day shipping! It is, indeed, the correct part and a perfect fit. Time will tell of its longevity, but it does its job......no more dreaded &#34;Check Engine&#34; light!
B00Q57UFBG|5|It works great!!! I would recommend this to everyone. If you don't have it then you need it. A must have for every car. This could very well save your life!!!
B000BOKML2|4|Good stuff.
B00B1VBQRS|5|We were about to drive from Arkansas to Penn, changed the oil and followed the recommendations to add on an empty tank.  My mileages jumped to 24-25 mpg while doing 80-85, engine felt smooth,  I will be using this every other oil change, another great product from Royal Purple...
B00CKFWKWY|4|Doeskin read all Airbag codes or SRS
B00HV87LVK|5|Great shifter for the money.  Works much better than the ratchet shifter I originally had.  Comes with 3 speed shift gate.  4 speed can be purchased separately.  Gates can also be modified for your liking.  Do a Google search too find out what others have done.
B00079ZFK4|4|Purchased this 3 years ago for my wife - I thought back then this jacket felt a little bit cheap and light weight.  So far, 3 years later, it is holding up just fine and she has broke it in pretty well and now kinda feels like a sweater weight.  She still wears other thermal layers but for the wind block and basic fit, it works great for her.  It also looks very nice on her fit body style.
B001D5I4SQ|3|Perfect
B00JORJEFC|5|Love this- it pushes the air around very well and doesn't draw from the battery much
B00UHD4HJA|5|Great 5 stars
B00DQSYKDG|3|I love Mechanix gloves and have used them for work for years.  I bought two pairs to replace the single pair I wore out over the winter.  The touch feature works well and is something I need as a supervisor using an iPad in sub-zero temps.  Note, these are not insulated...but it's better than anything else I've used.<br />Unfortunately, they do not last overly long.  Within a couple days, the seam between my thumb and forefinger came apart.  They are still completely usable, but this is the reason I dropped from 5 to 3 stars.  They are work gloves and should reflect that in design.
B00AMNW0X0|3|A Little Thin And Small
B00UHD4HJA|5|Great variety ! I'm in love

B005N221G6|5|I am very pleased with the lights for my car and I will use ya'll for future orders. Thanks......
B002DU3TTO|5|Very practical for a Corvette with the battery in the rear of the car.  The 12 foot lead is long enough to position the charger outside the vehicle while charging.
B00I3RCOF6|5|INSTALLED ON A 2004 COLORADO AND IT FITS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL FACTORY PART.
B000YEQP10|5|Great price about to order another set for a friend.

B000WK4EC8|5|Best Motorcycle Cleaner on the market!
B0050SGIOE|1|This listed as a METAL vacuum pump. It is not metal as advertised but plastic this a scam by OTC they are putting there Label on the Mityvac MV8000 and selling it for more money!!
B00J43YSMU|1|One of my bulbs didn't work i don't know y but I didn't send it back because it could of been damaged through the process of getting here
B00RM327NG|1|THIS PRODUCT requires you to stick a metal plate permanently to the back of your phone and I don't think many people would like that damage. They were nice and refunded me .
B001LNRRM4|1|Can't return it
B00A80EVXO|4|I wish it was yellow but it's more orange.
B003L643KS|5|Works as it should. Perfect fit on my Batteryminder.
B0031BHZZ8|5|Installed and working great.
B00TZF06VO|5|works great
B003TUNRGM|5|Worked as advertised.  Would buy again.
B00Z7N71UM|4|Love it
B0092KVYGI|5|as described. Thanks!
B000GU3KHO|4|I agree with other posters here, do not go by the seller's recommended sizes. I have a 500 cc Piaggio with a top box and the XL is a snug fit.  That was what I wanted, but be aware. I've bought this cover in XXL before -- I get about 2 years out of them -- and the looser fit blows around a lot in a strong wind, even with the elastic bottom, which loosens up over time, as all elastic will. TIP: Sunlight over the course of a summer will deteriorate any cover, so if you park in the sun (e.g., a parking lot) most of the year, use a second, cheap cover over it to take the UV hit, and this one will last much longer.
B0002T8FM4|5|Works great
B007D7QMX2|5|As described, thank you.
B00XZ9OU2M|1|I got the key fob in in a really short time the only problem is there are no programming instructions<br />And no way to. Contact the supplier
B00J7XSOFE|5|Excellent delivery and removes pilling from alcantara quickly and effortlessly. Recommended.
B00BSATJLC|5|Really nice quality. Very pleased.
B002DPTQX2|4|The pins are a challange.. But once setup it worked great. Kept the dish above ground level and out of the dirt and mud
B00032K4TW|5|Using this and cable ties, I put the front plate on the car without drilling holes. Cheap and useful!
B005NHPBLS|5|They fit my 2014 Chrysler T&C van perfectly.  Good quality - they should last a long time.  They also arrived on time.
B0083ROROC|4|Very good helmet, well constructed with high quality materials. Sizing is accurate for me; I ordered a large which is my normal hat size and found it fit very well and very snug. I am looking forward to it &#34;breaking in&#34; to loosen it up just a bit. Only two aspects prevent me from giving it a totally excellent rating: the double D ring chin strap and the sliding sun screen mechanism. Not only is the screen unduly complicated, but I also find that the setting is not secure and may suddenly retract into the helmet. That can be very disconcerting at highway speed. The double D ring chin strap is very simply old and difficult technology. A helmet at this level of price and sophistication should come with a european sliding buckle clasp.
B004ME11FS|5|Works well for a garden hose for my townhouse.
B00O5BC7I8|5|good product
B00HG2UEBA|1|Not heavy duty. Made of hard plastic. If you don't step in middle, it bends. Should have returned it
B002801NI8|5|Perfect stylish fit for 2015 Honda Pilot.
B00RBL9FKW|5|Really happy with my purchase.
B007RXBTI0|5|Use with<br />Ideaworks JB6368 S/4 Anti Vibration Pads ...<br />to get the door of the mini-fridge to open over the edge.<br />Works great.  Just the right size for the dorm fridge.
B000C9QEF4|5|WORKS OK
B000GQ6LF6|5|Very quality product.  Was easy to bolt on. Have used it twice and plan on many times over.
B00CEPV8TQ|5|Great fit and sturdy!
B0053O9EUA|5|Changed from the HD Synthetic oil to this in my '08 Ultra. Seems to have better clutch engagement with this. Highly recommend.
B000JZSKEY|5|First shipment came all bent out of shape and looked like someone had used it for a step stool. The replacement came perfect and my mechanic said it was as good as the one he supplied and yet I paid $100 less. My mechanic welcomes me to provide the parts. You may not be so lucky.
B00UCB7URS|5|These Balaclavas are a high quality, versatile design and a way better deal then you'll ever find in a ski shop! I ordered them with standard shipping and they arrived in 3 days! The company is extremely focused on customer satisfaction and with a great product like this they'll have many, many customers to satisfy!
B00QMWQSAG|4|A little smaller then I thought but still nice and a great value
B000ABCHH8|3|Works well. It was a bit messy to disconnect and was smelly on my hands. It was really hard to open the lid. I had to get a wrench to get the clear lid off.
B007CUKQVY|5|perfection
B004ALF3PW|5|good
B005RJ3GBE|5|Perfect replacement shell, can't complain at all.
B00DCULNXS|4|the connectors are not very good but the resisters are very good
B00I5058NQ|5|Received the lift at my front door 2 days after i ordered it and i used standard shipping. These guys from New York have great service and the product is even better. I love the new look of my truck and definetely am looking into buying a set of these for my friend. Absolutely love the lift.
B00UY6WFLM|4|Very suitable for rav4 2015
B009XRMW2U|5|These floor mats were purchased trimmed, and installed on a 2000 Subaru Outback.  I've seen thee trimmable mats before, but never had previous experience with it, and it was much easier to handle than I expected.  Initially, they came in a large package, attached to one another with two bolts/nuts.  This was easily removed, and I got the scissors out.  Other than trimming the trim tabs, the rear mats fit without modification.  he fronts drivers side required me to remove most of the trim tabs, and the front passenger side required me to trim one side of the tabs.  The fit was good.  not perfect - like the expensive &#34;custom&#34; ones, but a good fit ,with no obstruction of the pedals.  I told my wife that evening that I had put them in, and she said she hadn't noticed them there.  That tells me they fit well.  If they don't get in her way of driving, and she doesn't notice the appearance, then I have to assume they fit well, and the color was matched well.  My only regret is not getting to sets - now my wife's car looks good and well keep clean, and my Durango - not so much.  Assuming I'm still pleased in a couple months, I'll be putting the same set in my Durango.
B000GTZMY4|5|Good product,great price
B0046I3I8I|4|These are cheap wheel covers for the wheels on my travel trailer. It keeps the sun off the tires. Nothing fancy or special. They do the job.
B00MR3NLH2|3|I knew when I bought it I would need to modify it. We have a Polaris rzr 800. I searched everywhere for one to fit that model. No luck. what I didn't see from the pictures is the bottom needs to be fitted by drilling holes  in the frame and inserting a screw with a snap fitting attached. the 800 doesn't have the same framing as the 900 I guess.
B000C9GNIC|5|GOOD REPLACEMENT PART FITS JUST LIKE THE FACTORY PART
B008RU3FRA|5|Popped this baby in my 50cc Dazon Diamondback scoot, never felt such a difference in performance. My top speed maybe improved by 5mph but it packs one hell of a punch in exceleration. Certainly a must buy for those who struggle trying to move faster when the light turns green of turn left in a main road. Just don't abuse it, if your not careful, you can slowly damage your engine by constantly taking off or staying at full throttle. Also and very importantly make sure the pins are plugged in the correct spot and that it CLICKS when you plug it in (sometimes it can take a little force).
B002MQCY7C|5|So easy!! Wouldn't wear a helmet without one.
B0002T8FKG|5|Love this stuff! Best products
B003ZLS77E|4|Overall it looks and fits fine (2004 Ford Ranger). There is a plastic cover that fits over the piece of the handle that the 2 bolts are attached to. It serves little functional purpose, but the new part included with my new handle fell off because of the cheap plastic tabs that hold it in place. I was able to reuse the original one with metal tabs in its place. This was the cheapest handle I could find on Amazon, so I am not disappointed. Make sure to oil/white grease the latch mechanism when putting the new handle in.
B00SDMJLQ6|5|WORKS GREAT.....I HAVE A 2201 F-150.IT ALSO FIT IN MY WIFES 2011 KIA SOUL.
B00F2PJZCW|5|Worker well.
B000C2UIHQ|5|Never a dought
B0085CAQPY|4|I really like my new seat! I am tall and now I can slide back a little farther and can stretch my legs. I was having problems with my knees with the stock seat but no more. The mustang seat is well made and looks real good on my bike!
B00II5YADC|5|If you clean your own vehicle you have got to get this to help dry it. Trust me.
B00JXI9QE6|1|Where's my lights
B000KZUTCY|3|This is a pricey substitute for essentially JB Weld.  Try JB Weld first...if that doesn't work, then order this stuff.
B00F2GU6U6|1|The paper was off when I got them in the mail, they werent sticky. Didnt get to have fun with them.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Delivery was super fast and this item was super easy to program to my vehicle!  They were exactly as pictured and I have had no problems with them.
B00CU4L78S|5|Great fit and easy to to use and very good quality.This accordian style is much easier to use than a roll-up style I have had in the past.
B0002NIKFC|4|looks great in my 2004 Monte Carlo these floor mats are made to last make me smile every time I open the door to my spaceship
B004L0A9NI|1|BOTH bonnets were dirty and used.  If I could rate a zero star I would.
B00GWEU166|5|These bulbs are pretty bright in my dome light.
B005HQK3VS|5|Installed unit just fine. The window switches are reversed. All plugs matched, so the unit wiring is backwards.<br />Am not taking it all apart again to fix the wiring error.
B000YC6R5Q|3|Not as good as historically produced by this company.  Lower quality, breaks during installation, but item was quickly replaced by manufacturer. Works, but windows don't seal as well with product installed, and squealing during highway driving is a little annoying.  That said, I've decided to keep, and use.  These are still by far better than any stick on version.
B00062Z17Y|1|Seems good KN product BUT did not fit the stated application for my KN E 3951 filter!
B000VM09TE|5|Its been a year and a half, not rust and none has been able to cut it. I used it to lock my ladders in a very rough neighborhood.
B000CNN2A0|2|Said it would fit my 2015 RAM 1500 EXT CAB OUTDOORSMAN... Well... It doesn't.  With a trip to the muffler shop it will.  Stock muffler is 12in long, this one is 10in long.  Not exactly a direct fit as I was under the impression of.  BUT I will take it into the shop let them jimmy rig something and my truck will sound awesome..
B00BMDYWTY|5|Looks great
B005JPJNMW|5|Extremely Great Product!  I had been working with the Foam Pads for Cutting and Buffing over the past Year.<br />And, I am  very pleased that Mcguiars came up with their MICROFIBER CUTTING AND BUFFING PADS for D.A. Polishers.  I have used both their 6&quot; and 3 inch micro fiber pads- they are really Great!  MADE IN THE USA, have 2 pieces per package, are manufactured by sewing (and possibly gluing) a piece of foam sandwiched between a micro-fiber Cutting/Buffing Surface with an EXTREMELY STRONG CLOTH LIKE MATERIAL that attaches to the backing plate.  And man, do they perform like nothing else I have worked with!  So, save your time (shopping around) and money for foam pads that under perform (for the most part).  I recently used both a 3&quot; and 6&quot; microfiber from Mcguiars to detail a 2011 Ford Mustang (dark color- purple metal flake).  The paint was moderately jacked up with a lot of oxidation, bird droppings, a bunch of swirling and several significant deep scratches.  I detailed the entire car with just the 2 pads- 6&quot; and 3&quot; Microfiber from Mcguiars,  cut for hours and when I was finished, there was no apparent wear with either of the 2 pads- they will hold up for many more vehicles-  the micro fiber from Mcguiars are far superior to any foam pads I had ever used.  And, when you consider the Price, 2 pads per package, Made in the U.S.A. AND, they hold up like steel, do yourself a favor and buy these
B0012ILZAS|5|Haven`t put  on yet but sure ill love it
B007V2E8GW|5|Fits perfectly in my 2011 Sorrento! Completely darkens the inside of my car. My car is not Floridian and the heat was causing major distress. This lowered the temp in my car 4 to 9 degrees. So good I had to buy one for my 09 Rondo! Amazing customer service and quick delivery. Will order from seller again :)
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Incredibly easy to use, durable and overall a great purchase!
B00E8TAEZU|3|Good gauge just need a flexible hose
B002ZTK946|3|So apparently I use my door lock on my driver side more than my passenger side (even though that is not true since the locks are activated together every time automatically) as I have now gone through 3 of these on the driver's side and I am still using the first replacement on the passenger's side.  And neither of my rear locks have had an issue.  I just don't know.  Fairly easy to replace on 2002 F150 Supercrew, though I hate doing it.  The rubber boot does not like to stay put and I usually cut my hands a few times trying to install it, but maybe it's just me.
B004AQZUX2|5|Extremely cheap but so far zero issues.  Fitment was perfect.
B0031OYB84|5|bought it to repair a damaged seat cover looks like I took it to a shop to be reupholstered very happy with product
B000RUDAY6|5|Perfect fit.  Works great
B004O2LDO2|5|installed in 45 min. very easy
B00EI6CKVE|5|Sticks on without any hassle, large size and overall a great purchase
B00771WT0E|5|They fit great
B000C5HTAC|1|also, .Also they say they were never contacted.  They are saying that it was my fault for the wrong part, even thought the page says it will fit. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!  If I could give them a ---*** I would.
B00AAICNPW|5|Great tires and they arrived fast.
B00Q75V3XU|4|just needed a pony end for my grow house lights works good for that
B00CJ5DV2I|5|Well made and works as expected.
B00HZ86YAU|5|The 1842 was easy to hookup and reprogram my 2002 F150 but I had major problems installing the software. I kept receiving an error that the USB drivers failed to install correctly. After 5 attempts (using Windows Vista) I moved to my wife's laptop (Windows 7) and it only took me about 10 minutes to update a and program my programmer. I think it was my computer but couldn't get in touch with tech support so that's why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, 5 stars all the way. I wanted to see if there really is a difference so I changed my truck from &#34;stock&#34; to &#34;performance&#34; and there really is a difference! Throttle response and acceleration is DEFINITELY improved. If I add a few extras to my truck, I should see even more improvement. I mainly bought this for the towing aspect and mileage so I will update in a couple of weeks when I go camping, So far, I'm happy with the outcome. UPDATE: I used the economy setting to pull my trailer to the beach in stop and go traffic and I'm happy to report and increase of 2-2.5mpg! The only drawback, performance wasn't as good but I'm okay with that.
B0031ZDU62|4|Exact fit as to the old ones and a good value, to early to tell how they will last but after a couple of weeks, they are working fine. May give a update after a few months of service.
B00BB1JAIU|1|Didn't fit the molding of the front bumper at all. Ended up selling it.
B00075XCBC|5|This Is my first time at Amazon 😀 And I've purchased 3 items so far. My hitch for my Nissan Armada was spot on I really didn't think I would get the right part you guys came through especially for my second part it was my back LED light saved a lot!!!!!!! And for my 3rd purchase. My daughter has autism and I needed a certain dinosaur  that spits venom the Delapa Sauris. Nobody had this not Target not Walmart. In the words of Robert Dinero! You ! Your good you! Na were just doi, uuaaa! your good!
B00907Z6PI|5|Great looking frame.  Picture is a very good representation of what was received.
B009TC9PG0|5|Nice and cold- very easy to add on
B005G7Y2XS|4|As advertised. It allows me to comply with the law.It is strictly an on/off device. In other words, it is for emergency stops.
B001KO84I0|5|Cool tool
B00ST2AHE0|5|LOVE THESE!  I use this to power up my subwoofer and amp in my trunk.  The LED on it is nice because you can tell when the subwoofer is on or off.<br /><br />Great design, and awesome color.
B00BNIOH84|3|Ok
B00P87W0IU|5|Fantastic.  Car is slick to the touch for days after application.
B008FCD0DE|1|Wrong one, did not receive a return pickup label.
B0015FYQ90|5|Incredible. Takes a bit of anxiety out of driving. Get one. Really!
B00SMS4TAO|5|great customer service. One bulb wasn't working, sent replacement right away. Awesome product. Thanks!
B00KR7H56I|4|Good value, simply yet effective
B000VXIA94|3|Excellent terminal if it fit. I bought both the Positive and the Negative. This is supposed to be the Negative terminal and is marked with the (-) sign for Negative... but it's too big! It fits the Positive so I know it's marked wrong. I had to bend and put a copper penny between the terminal and my new battery post to make it fit. I tried the lead battery caps from the auto store but they were too big.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|these little puppies are awesome.<br />Shipping was way fast!
B0013U9YUS|4|Good quality part but LOUD, I had to add a glasspack to quiet it down. Even with a catalytic converter .
B00K2QPRT6|5|Great decal
B00AFVTL9K|5|OEM Filter for Land Rover, great quality. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B00IA9NVU4|5|Great product! Instructions are straight forward and easy for anyone to follow, gave my 2012 suburban a great look and stands apart from the rest
B0023VIP1A|5|good product. I like it.
B0000AXQPA|5|Ordered two of these.  Fit perfect on my Harley fairing.  Nice look and protects my radio from the elements.
B00ARURLWS|5|Can't believe how inexpensive these are.  No problems yet.
B001P2GDTE|5|These bars are nice and takes maybe an hour total install time with a ratchet. Maybe an extra half hour to get everything level. They're painted more of a flat black. Not shiny but they have a hint of shine. The plastic pads are really cheap compared to rubber pads you'd find on other more expensive models but they hold up well. Make sure you put the right brackets where they need to be. They're all labeled so it shouldn't be an issue. Other then that great buy for the low price!
B00AN5SPCC|5|Great price, and great product!
B005TOLSBC|5|Money saver
B00KGIE5AC|5|Exact replacement. Bolted right on and works perfectly.
B0074DFTKM|4|Fit and worked well.  Connectors are a little loose - added dielectric grease.
B0093XZDS4|3|Little pricy....!
B00JA396BC|5|Good thanks
B00IMUC9YA|5|I absolutely love this product. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves that added touch of bling. It's very durable and the diamonds are very secure and it doesn't hurt my hands or anything.
B0016KFVV6|5|At first I was skeptical. I read you had to drop the exhaust (and I'm not mechanically inclined in the least). NOPE! Me and my 9 yr old daughter had it installed in ab 30 minutes. She held up one side while I tightened the bolts. EASY to install, EASY to follow directions. If you are thinking about buying this product. Please do. It's worth every penny. And it's amazing. And when it's not in use, just pop the plastic piece back in, voila! Can't tell you have a hitch! 5 stars!
B003PB9RZ0|5|Fan works very well.  I first bought a look alike fan off eBay thinking I could save some money.  Nope, just wasted money instead.  This thing pulls a heck of a lot more air than the cheaper fans. Don't make the mistake that I did.  Go with a name brand proven fan.
B000BQR100|5|Thank you.
B00062YK4O|5|I have K&N on all my vehicles!
B008Y84XCQ|4|They are really cute however for the price I expected a better material other than just plastic
B0016IRHMO|5|AC Delco part, brand new, perfect fit.  The absolute best price was from Amazon. Thanks!
B007683L5U|4|Awesome.  Best sunshade yet for van.  Wish there was a way to make storage more compact as it is very bulky when rolled up which is why I deducted a star.
B00GLW42BO|2|Instructions require 24 hr. charge before use.  After 48 hrs unit was still charging and not showing a full charge (steady green light).  Tried to return it but when requested return shipping label got run around.  Back and forth email explaining the situation several times till I finally gave up and paid the return shipping.  Never tried it as I didn't want to take a chance on unit that possibly was defective.  Construction and functionality appear adequate but not up to what a high end unit should be.  Not great, but probably an OK buy-  if it worked.  AMAZON:  Poor customer service on this one!!!
B00BB0FQLQ|5|Best Floor liner on the market. Fits perfectly on my 15 Brz Limited. Easy to clean too.
B00AMLQ4BG|5|Fit my 2013 Tundra Crew Max SR5 4x4 just fine. Easy install as long as you get the tubes pointed in the right direction. Very sturdy. They have enough drop that my 5 year old can use them to easily climb into the back. Comfortable step in for me too.
B001MXL71A|5|This is the 2nd one that I purchased for my aging dad.  He wanted to put in each vehicle in case of an emergency when he is on the road.  The 1st one worked great.
B000BUU5Y0|5|Purchased for our 5th wheel, this does the job!  Make sure you know your measurement between your tires when ordering.
B007USCM7E|4|Air conditioner is working great now, but extra Freon in can leaked out inside a week.
B00L4LFXYC|5|Very good quality!
B00HB9JXMY|5|Great experience will definitely use again. Thanks
B000GKD5NI|2|It won't stick to glass properly. Suction is not good. Keep hanging most of the time on 2 or 3 suction caps.
B00DBENCZC|5|Looks sharp
B0027I88VQ|5|Works great. Just what I wanted.
B00080QHMM|5|Works great! Fast and accurate.
B000NKCIKM|5|I have a 2010 Cadillac CTS-V with 650rwhp. This is a great price on the filter. I would buy the added magnet that applies to this like a beer coozie.
B008WDSIWY|3|Awesome love them but had to glue them to the helmet cause the suction cups are s***
B001GC2LVM|5|Best leveling product out there, so simple to use, quality
B00RH3AMIS|5|Exactly as advertised, very fast shipping, Would use again.
B005C980N8|1|I wish I could review the actual product I ordered.  I purchased these from Pickup Specialties for my 2004 Toyota Tundra. I received an email a day later that this particular brand listed here is back ordered for 6 months, and would I accept a different brand that is &#34;identical&#34;.  What I received was total junk. They are not shaped right, look like factory seconds,  and will not fit the vehicle at all. Pickup Specialties claimed a 90 day money back guarantee but are now ignoring my emails. Consider yourself warned.
B00DJE1PYE|5|Bought these before my 5,000 mile round trip to Sturgis this year.  Man!!!!  I would have died without them.  The quality is what you would expect from Kuryakyn...excellent.  The fitment was perfect and easy.  I love the design and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.
B006K8GPHI|4|These are great rags for my at home auto shop. They do give off a bit of lint when being used and I have seen the color bleed off onto my gloves. As such if you are using them for wipe down/cleaning purposes on a finished surface I would go forward with caution.
B0000AXF21|5|These are well made, but realize they are very heavy.
B00JFFG67C|1|Very flimsy, and did not work as anticipated.  Cannot return because I had to alter the connections.
B000LQ78YY|5|They are very nice, and seem to work well in my living room.  I do feel they are maybe too easy to unlock them to get the batteries.  I don't know that would be an issue when using them in real life, and I hope I never find out.
B005EV22O2|5|Fit perfectly, arrived on time, easy easy installation. Steel components, shine brightly and last
B008Y8137E|5|Looks ok to me. I'm happy.
B00VAWOJXG|5|Just want I expected
B002GP87NO|5|Everything was Great!! Ordered more, thanks!
B00429NKWK|4|Makes for an easy and efficient way to get the headlight covers back almost to the original clearness.
B00IO4EYMY|5|Good price, Great product...
B001CF3ND8|1|Returned after rips and unwraveling of their poorly sewn molle.<br /><br />Here is an alternative to this item... I used an old TAC vest and 550 cord and seperated front and back plate, cost me 30$, I have just as many pockets and its molle also. Quality is better since it us US issued equipment and made to last.<br /><br />I tied off the top plate carrier snaps to the head rest bars and tied the bottom corners of the vest to the bottom rails of the seat, and not only do I have a better product for a fraction of the cost, but now I dont have to sit on uncomfortable cordura material, and my seat A/C isnt restricted anymore. The front of the seats are completely uncovered. This tells me that these guys are charging WAY too much, since I rigged something together for a 3rd of what one seat costs for two seats...
B00G2TV7OG|5|Put these in for DRL upgrades on a 2013 Tahoe.  They're a pure white and very bright.
B00T2XWQCQ|2|I bought the extra large and in doesn't fit a standard Chinese moped scooter.  Please note that the size info for the XL is listed as larger than wat is listed for the XXL.  Make no sense.  I measured my seat before ordering and if the if the info was correct it would have fit. The company needs to get it's act together.
B00BG3G83S|5|Worked great!
B005NLQAHS|5|Inexpensive. Works fine on my 2001 Honda Accord for pulling codes and lots of other stuff with Torque app on android phone. Using this and poking around on the internet I was able replace the part throwing the codes for hundreds less than it would have cost if I had just taken the car into the shop.
B004SSEOQG|5|Works like a charm! Couldn't ask more from the price
B00JFRFCXY|5|the price was perfect and it a perfect fit for my hummer h3 2006. very easy to work with and is a open and play item. exactly like describe and like the picture
B009OJ0I4G|1|Works but extremely noisy<br />Would not Reccomend it<br />LASTED about 6 mths<br />Went down to the local salvage yard and got 1 for  $10.00  and guess what it's 2 years later and it still Works
B00PCUE054|4|It looks just like the picture! I had it for a month it looks still new, but hopefully it lasts longer! Lol GET IT
B001C6L5XM|5|Great fit
B002N5YEZM|4|Works very good for the money.<br />Very adjustable and sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  It could be a little easier to adjust height because I have slide it apart once adjusting it.<br />  Maybe a limiter or better release.
B010YDO4FO|5|Is it too much to ask for gearhead's like us to get good parts at reasonable prices!!.....apparently not, I have just unboxed and installed this beautiful and well made short shifter in my S14 and I have to say that I'm very impressed with the fitment and just how sharp and precise my shifts feel, I bought this shifter to replace an ageing MEGAN V2 shifter that only had about 3 years on it and I can say right off that P2M's V3 shifter fits and feel's better then the MEGAN ever did!...I highly recommend this to any 240 owner who isint willing to pay the 250$ price for the B&M.
B004SFKJIQ|1|No spout to poor waste. Sent back
B00MEWP6LA|5|Good product. Saves on the back from lifting 5 gallon can
B00WOY33EA|5|works great,better than the oem
B008CQUUIQ|5|fit great
B00H6XPZN6|5|I love my new shade!  My wife is always concerned about excessive sun and she loves the extra one...
B003M2D07S|1|Ordered two<br />Two different manufacture's<br />one is falling apart<br />Also they are different sizes
B00BJMIZOG|3|As described ..sturdy..shipping was prompt....but had to re-drill one side as the hole was made badly.
B00W30U2QM|5|fantastic
B00L84AFPC|4|Hubby is very pleased to have these added to his truck and help complete it to make it HIS truck
B00RW7WTVW|5|Easy to install and work 😊
B009EA3IGA|5|Came in within 2 days. Front one didnt line up with holes but aftet some drilling it fit perfect. And they look great
B0049EOOTQ|5|As described.
B00707B9AG|5|Easy to install
B00PEAU0L0|5|Very bright and very blue! Will buy more.
B000GZBZOE|5|I always purchase the auto vent shades that lock in due to the fact that the tape on ones always come loose. They are worth the extra money.
B00WDSVEE8|5|These are very lightweight and easy to clip on/off. Unlike some other clip-ons I have seen, you can wear these WITHOUT looking like a bug-eyed dork!  Very discreet in appearance.
B0024E6W02|3|Seems to be good quality, but be careful of sharp wires sticking out near the fitting ends.  I cut the crap out of my finger... not a good thing when handling poopstuffs.
B00KG13S20|5|Great product for the price. Comes with easy to use tie downs too. Fits our 20' center console well. Just put it on so we'll see how it holds up to the FL rainy season. But so far good with regard to quality, price, and ease of use.
B0051W7MYY|5|Very durable and rugged mat I have cleaned it a few times with a pressure washer and it still looks great nice rubber backing.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Love these holders. Great gift for my teenage daughter.
B00G0P0ER8|5|Great fitting part.  I put a little bit of car wash soap on it so it would slide right into place.  The old one had broke and fell apart.  Fits my 2004 Toyota Sienna Van just fine.
B000FW2MCM|5|works well and received item quickly. would recommend to others
B000HEBR3I|2|Didn't work.  Sent it back. Not well made.
B00657C2JE|2|wrong thing didn't fit
B001VYO9JC|5|Fits my 2007 Silverado crew cab very well.  No complains.
B00FTBW1CK|5|as described fast shipping highly recommend
B000M5Y720|5|Helps with night vision!
B000C36BGW|4|It was good as it was supposed to.
B00KSUA6HY|5|A must have , great difference before and after! In love with them
B000C36B30|4|It was good as it was supposed to.
B001C5CPR8|5|Thank You,<br /><br /> Tbone
B0036R6IT6|5|Comfortable seat. Little difficult to install on 2015 Suzuki rear rack, but only meant putting clamps in different locations than what instructions depicted.
B008YGPAG6|2|Material was stretchy and ran small. Had to return it.
B0012GTVVA|5|This was one of the least thought of items that once you install it you wonder what did we ever do without it. It took about 15 minutes to install which was actually a shorter amount of time than it took to decide exactly where to mount it. I mounted it 2 inches above the center support of the screen door.  That worked out perfectly for grab height and hardware functionability.  We really don't know how we camped without it. We camped for a week since installed and have had no problems, holding up well.
B00UG52P7U|5|Awesome Backseat Organizer for any car.  I sits nicely around the head of the drivers or passenger seat then attaches to anything you can find underneath the seat of the car.  Once attached it does not move, which I was worried about because I figured the wind would throw it everywhere.  It has many pockets to place things in, I have been using it to simply hold items I have laying on the ground of my car.  I umpire and weight lift a lot as hobbies so I place certain items that fit inside of this Backseat Organizer.  My car has gone from a mess to actually organized.  I absolutely love this organizer.  I would like to thank Decanus for allowing me to test this awesome product at a reduced price!
B00B7OH6QY|5|Make my IS look like a beast!
B005QE7EPY|4|Does what it's intended to do.  Takes longer than I thought it would to install in my 2011 Camry (especially getting it to wrap around the rear view mirror).  I'm not sure if I paid to much for it, but it seems it will last at least 5 years.
B0000AXRH5|5|Excellent product and seller.
B00HYWC1DQ|5|Exact replacement. Looks like new. Works great. Used on a 2006 VW Beetle
B0051E4AMY|4|Exact fit as to the old ones and a good value, to early to tell how they will last but after a couple of weeks, they are working fine. May give a update after a few months of service.
B00AAMHD3K|2|These were no brighter than the stock Ford bulbs - maybe even not as bright.  A real disappointment.  I'd put the OEM bulbs back in, but they're a little bit of a pain to change on the truck.  Hopefully they have a decent life.  I'll put the OEM bulbs back in when these burn out.
B004BRINTS|5|I like it
B00OHQAYHW|5|Perfect!
B004R30AJW|4|Ok
B004804NNI|5|Works great
B00538TU8C|5|fits great
B007USCM7E|5|So easy to recharge a/c!!!
B006GLEBIO|4|Overall the glow kit is kinda cheap, but the price is right when your just goofing off with stuff on your car. Works great, no issues with that at all. I had to spentd about $15 to get hardware and heavy duty double sided tape to mount to the bottom of my car. Definitely does not come with everything you need.
B004PPXZIA|5|Unit functions as specified.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Ramps work great, wish they had a handle on them to carry them though
B006FLMGGO|3|It came rolled up and bent up.  Packaging was terrible and it doesn't sit super snug to the trunk but overall it does the job.  Overpriced IMO.
B004ZF39T0|5|Exactly as described. Is a great match to my LEDs. Quick delivery.
B00L42LP7A|5|My car sounds amazing now the quality is good enough for the price but I'm pretty sure my iat has increased
B005H28X46|5|Recommended by my local auto parts store for my BMW 335D
B00JNEB37I|5|Perfect
B00SVRHD22|5|I love this Microfiber, I use it to wash and dry my brand new car. I recommend this product for others.
B012BPUYKC|4|Great product but, for my 2015 ranger crew 900 the plexiglass was a little too wide to fit with the rubber seal but, who needs the seal anyways right!
B000GROHQ0|5|Exactly what they said it would be.
B000VUC566|5|It fits great in the back of my Honda Ridgeline ! It seems to be in good quality.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Went from yellow deteriorated headlights to like new. Lots of patience and elbow grease though. Skill at this is everything.
B00A0GN10U|5|Perfect
B00OVW09N6|5|Good
B006VCWY4Q|5|Awesome product looks great in my 750LI
B000BEZNSO|5|This is a good product that is offered cheaper here than anywhere else.  It fits perfect on our campers's intake and comes in handy for many uses.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Great on my leather couches, car leather seats and leather bags. It is a bit pricey but lasts a long time and comes with the cloth to apply it. Does not leave a film residue like some other kinds and not a bad scent. I keep buying this one.
B00NF1EXAE|5|Nice product.<br />Fast delivery.
B00NWGZ3A6|4|Nice multimeter! Compact design and handy size. Was a great purchase at a great value!
B006F441SW|5|awesome
B001P1XF1E|1|it work for  only 1 month
B0071I3OAC|5|Works perfectly.
B005CLMSMU|5|Worked perfectly for the 2000 Plymouth Neon I have.  The old handle was sticking so the door wouldn't close sometimes and even fly open while driving.  I'm not sure why this is advertised as Front or Rear since it does NOT have a lock provision.  It is intended for the rear.
B00IKL1Y3S|5|Super Fast shipping. Great price. They even included a spark plug socket for installation. Highly recomend
B000CRET3U|5|Nothing better than Anchor when it comes with this kinds of product...never had any single issue of fitting it, straight from the box hassle free installation!
B002DQH4W6|5|Thanks again just as described
B00JIHC36K|1|I have one set that I purchased a while back that have been flawless as parking lights, but have gone through the refund process numerous times after I decided to buy another set for sidemarkers. They either stop working completely or begin to flicker and go out in segments. They are also burning hot after use. While just as bright as advertised, not sure I can recommend these with the terrible consistency and reliability.
B00MPJWMVY|5|good
B002DPHDF0|5|Works as advertised
B000LQHCJK|1|This item only work about 5 times it is definitely not worth the money
B00HQZNOQO|5|Fit like a glove.
B00WY3CADQ|5|Plug and play, perfect fit in my w210 1999 Mercedes E320. extremely bright! 6000k matches headlights perfectly! clean cut off line. I would definitely recommend to any w210 owner looking for LED license plate lights
B002JH7PEQ|4|Has worked great so far.  Went on a long trip and it satisfied our needs.  Make sure you know what size plugs you are using.  if you are going to be using two large plugs, this will not work for you because the plugs are close together.  If you are using regular plugs it will work great!  Fan is a little noisy but not too bad.
B004HIPRPO|5|Worked perfectly with '68 Camaro.  Sound is just right and fit perfectly
B00OU2BCNS|5|happy with this item
B0072GW3F0|4|Very fine
B006QGD996|4|A little more lightweight than expected, but very long straps.  I use them just as backup for my more sturdy ones.  For motorcycles, get something stronger.  Rubber covers on the winch part come off way too easily, which is a bit annoying.  Overall, not a bad deal for the price.
B00GUDCVN0|5|PART WORKED AS ADVERTISED AND SOLVED MY LIFTGATE ISSUE
B00QQ40PIG|1|Didn't work
B00IKSN8VM|4|Good.
B00BWT353C|5|Excellent
B001KR8APE|5|Part worked without issue in my 96 Chevy Corsica (aka Bernice). Saved a ton of money vs buying at the local auto parts store.
B009NP4N24|2|They work but i wasn't expecting them to be made out of cheep plastic.
B00SDFY7P8|1|Bristles from both brushes started to come off. They're also glued together,  the whole thing came apart.
B00N2K6M2A|1|Never worked.  Wouldn't connect with Torque.  As is the case with many generics it's a gamble as to whether you'll get one that actually works.
B008S7A4IU|3|buen producto
B00FA75NC8|5|Exactly as advertised.  Great support from the seller.  Thanks.
B004GFTC0E|4|The lenses on my 06 Honda Pilot were dull and foggy after 10 years. The product has multiple steps and somewhat labor intensive. It took me around 2 hrs. to complete all the different applications but the results were good. Now lets see how long the lenses stay clear
B001GRSPR6|5|Great product, quick delivery!
B000W0KUEY|5|Great locks, could have more rust resistant surface.<br />Need to clean more often then normal padlocks.
B00GHTE2IO|5|Saved me $160 from having someone else do it. Took me 30mins to do it but if i had to do it again would take less then 10min. Simple its just 2 screws to undo cut and reattach them and your done. I cut them short they way people wont kick them as much when they are sitting in the passenger seat.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Just as expected. Beautiful
B00WOY33EA|5|Before I found these I tried making something like it from plastic.  Epic fail.  These end caps went on in less than an hour, and they work great!  Excellent fix, easy install!!
B001BDPG4A|5|Thank you for the quality parts
B008BCG4HM|5|Great map lights for tacoma. leds are directional so flip them over if don't work the first time
B000F11972|4|fits okay but I really need to use Velcro to make it fit snug.
B0024NO9CG|5|Super price, fit perfectly, arrived in short order, easy to install.....!
B002N1J5IM|5|It is what it is and that is good
B005BN46TM|5|Nice item
B0006IX87S|5|Received as described. Worked well with my fan spray mister system.
B000Z0HVHA|5|The light has the brightness I needed when I respond to calls and the extension cord works perfectly.  Barry
B006JXVW72|5|I hate leaks, so I immediately replaced these inner axle seals at the first sign of seepage.  These seals worked great and stopped the leak.
B00Y195OR0|5|Awesome purchase
B000WLHGJA|5|best money ever spent great valve works great
B001GN6QS0|4|Watch the end.  They are not standard I ordered the wrong ones
B00ZYTU354|5|Everything on time and worked perfect
B0002SA0AA|4|This is certainly the best fabric top that I've had. With the windshield channel, there is very little flapping--the multiple straps also help. I wish that the straps over the front doors connected side to side (passenger to driver). Because they are just velcro, they slide down and allow water to pool when it rains. Overall though, I'm very happy with it.
B0042ZIT7U|4|Nice mat... grass doesn't stick to it.  Chairs will leave indentations in the plastic weave though.
B006TMLVVA|5|It's ok. got it for my son in law so i guess it works.
B00HND017Y|5|No problems whatsoever! Great!!
B00CJ5DZE2|5|This product is a REAL tiime saver, for a fraction of the cost of a shop brake bleeder.  Homerun Motive, homerun!
B008KKPC7S|5|Perfect fit in our 2007 Volvo XC90. Would have preferred a part made in the USA, but this was available sooner. We'll see how it holds up. The price was certainly right.
B010SII91U|4|Parts arrived after 2 weeks.  I ordered red as pictured but they look more like dark Orange.
B00GMRM3KA|5|Easy install on my Jeep and the difference between the OEM and these are incredible. I was shocked to see the difference. I would consider this a must purchase just from the safety aspect of it. Being able to see better at night is priceless.
B008J25JHA|1|It did not work with my 2002 Rendezvous...I will not buy a factory second clicker in the future now that I am aware of the fact that the numbers on the clicker must match up!
B0009XDITS|5|Fast delivery.  Perfect fit on my 1990 Ford F-250 4x4. Drill six 1/2&#34; holes and it bolts right on. I did it alone with the help of two clamps to hold it in place.
B000C7M6G2|5|Works great
B00DZLUXD0|5|Great price on expensive BMW parts
B000KYVEAQ|1|Can't get the darn thing to connect to our 2004 MDX :(
B00GG9FB8U|5|Perfect for if you don't have a water line to hose your car off if you want to/enjoy washing it yourself, it's kind of therapeutic to do it yourself once in a while :)
B000BPSVV4|5|looks so slick! great price and feels good when driving.
B00VVFNHXA|5|With the help of a YouTube video and 20 minutes the new motor was installed. The only thing I wish that came with the motor was the rubber boot. It seems someone had replaced my motor before and left that part out...
B005063TEI|5|It is messy but works.
B00I9SK52S|4|Love the product.  The can's spray nozzle on a couple of cans clogged during use.  I used a nozzle from another can and continued my project.  This would have been an issue if I had only purchased one can but since I purchased a six pack, I was able to switch nozzles.
B000BUU5Z4|5|Cute, do the job wish have some blue red and black:)
B00068WNZG|5|just the smell is too strong but works and makes things shiny i wouldn't say mirror polish but shiny and you have to work hard to make it look shiny
B00B5XTCMS|5|It's smaller then I thought but it's still very cute
B00BYGTZKK|5|Just as advertised.  Delivery was excellent.
B00A23B6E4|5|Love these things!!!
B000GD5FMY|5|They fit great and feel freat when I ride. No fogging when when its hot
B0088P06AS|5|An absolute necessity to use with 3M Tape for body mouldings or spoilers.Crack and crush the little vial and apply to the area where the tape will go, after you have cleaned it with alcohol..NOT GIN OR VODKA. Makes the application far easier and stick better.
B002PUTC0M|5|I am a professional auto technician and this product has exceeded my expectations.very accurate for today's automobiles with tire monitor sensors.same as the the ones being sold on the tool trucks for a lot less.you will not be disappointed.
B000C2WERS|5|Fit my 4 cylinder 98 toyota camry. Fixed my problem and is doing the job as well as any OEM product.
B004C443P8|5|Love the fit and the style! I have added silver spikes to the gloves and made them even better! thanks
B00BCRMAAS|3|OxGord 17pc set arrived promptly.  Upon opening, there was a very strong toxic chemical smell.  I did check out each piece and they seem to made nicely.  Because of the horrible smell, I am unable to put into my vehicle still, as I don't want my vehicle to be trapped with the smell and my children to breath it.  I will edit this review again once I put item in my vehicle.
B00XYSZ1D6|3|Just okay quality but rather expensive.
B00ZQEN8X6|4|Decent set of brackets. Welds look like a 5 yr okd did it but overall it's good. Easy to put on/ just bolted up.
B000F5LKNQ|5|I am happy with this looks cool and perfect step up
B000221M94|5|This protector keeps my car doors from getting &#34;dinged&#34; when opened against the cement block wall of our garage.  Need to order another one so that it will protect the front door as well.  We didn't want to drill holes in the wall so we used clear silicone to secure it and it works great.
B000BZI4K2|5|worked as expected
B000RFLR0U|1|Does not work. It told me I had broken wires every were, about ten places. I went to a good online forum and asked the moderator in the electrical section which wire colors and location on the box on the firewall. Then test the voltage between that and the next each connector. You may have to remove the dash cover. It was a broken wire under the brake master cylinder. I cut it and added a new wire. It took about three weeks to learn how this all works, but I learned. If a old truck why not, but I did run through 20 fuses. It can cost about $200.00 at a small shop to find the problem.
B002L1F9BQ|5|Great service, no complaints at all. Very pleased.
B00O4F7PA0|1|The worst piece of trap I ever order, doesn't fit my 1996 Honda accord, now can't send it back because my son had to use gorilla glue to make it work, will not order again from the factory or whoever it came from.  I hate it and further more it is supposed to have two more parts to go with it and maybe that is why it didn't work.  One side fit the radio and the other side wouldn't fit.
B00QJWUPC6|5|These look great bring and white compared to stock
B005R6R6DG|4|Eats my poops.
B00SW8TI14|4|Great product. Definitely puts out a lot* of light only disadvantage is that about a month after having it it got condensation in the lens. Owned this brand before and was shocked with how well their products are built and how much light they produce
B002MQOXGW|1|Bought Accu-Gage RA60X about 3 years ago to ease checking of motorcycle tire pressure, for which right-angle chuck is a good idea.  However, the poorly-designed shallow opening makes it difficult to seal against tire valve stem.  Even worse, the chuck came off the metal tube, to which it had been joined by glue rather than threads.  As it didn't seem worth returning for replacement, I repaired it with a hose clamp and wire to make it usable but even more difficult to hold onto the valve stem.  Other reviewers describing this product as junk are being too kind.
B00A1XDD7I|5|OEM oil filters just as I expected
B009CNYJG2|1|Simply does not work for measuring current. The multimeter function works, but that it and that's all!
B0041PZBLI|4|I purchased this thermometer a year or more ago and mounted it in our Jeep. There was a delay in shipping due to availability (which is the reason for the 4-star rating), but other than this it suits our purpose well.
B0031HNHPY|5|Fit and function perfect. Four years ago Purolator had their part numbers mixed up for the 2009 Nissan Altima cabin filter (it did not fit as original OEM) but now just like OEM with great fit and function.
B0009YDPFO|5|Nice small economical trash solution for even sub compacts
B000S2SHZK|5|Fixed my problem in my 2003 Escalade where the rear overhead ceiling vents would only blow cold despite being set to heat. After I replaced this unit, it properly blows hot or cold with the thermostat setting.
B002MQCYO0|5|The secret is, this stuff is worth twice as much to a welder. I clean my hood with it every day and it makes my lenses last ten times as long. A welders best friend.
B00K85BSPI|5|yes good
B000PWV9NA|5|perfect fit
B000NJ1HIC|5|Thank You,<br /><br /> Tbone
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Perfect for a motorcycle. Buy one and toss it under your seat.
B00VNBDVOC|5|Very bright compared to my old halogens. I'll update if they die on me, but for now they are bright and instant on (and off). Install went pretty well, but they were a SNUG fit, and I had to put a log &#34;english&#34; on them to get them to turn into their slots. Also, there was no instruction manual in any of the boxes, so I had to rely on Youtube and online instructions and comments. That isn't a reason to give the product less than 5 stars, but I thought it worth mentioning.
B0067P2E7O|5|when used with tuner and swept pipes. awesome performance and sound
B009WE01FO|5|Hey, it's Arlen Ness.... 'nuff said.  My wife's 2012 Softtail Slim came without a coil cover and I didn't want her to a shock if she gets in the rain.  The fitment was perfect and the quality is----well like I said, it's Arlen Ness.
B00PW30ZPU|5|One tip: When you set it the first time, mark one of the side mirror covers. This helps in quickly setting it up starting with the side mirror covers.
B000LVBQBU|5|These Valeo wiper blades are very good quality, they are quiet even on a dry windshield, they last a long time in this Texas heat and they are reasonably priced. My only reservation is they can be a bit tricky to install. I have used several sets of them over a period of years on different vehicles always with good results.
B000GRZIRW|5|:D
B00SI6V2D2|4|nice gloves for the price... Happy with my perches...
B004CIOJIK|5|Well built, high quality, kit with good instructions. Very easy install with just basic hand tools in the driveway, no lift or jack required.  Doesn't come with shock boots, so if you want them order prior to install - I feel it finished the look nicely. Would recommend a little WD40 to get the bushings in at the shock head and for mounting to the center shackle / bracket.  Immediate improvement noted post install.  I'm only running 34's but still got a lot of vibration with OE stabilizer, this kit took it right away. Biggest thing I'm noticing is over decent bumps at speed JK feels much more &#34;in control&#34;.
B00BT0970O|5|Love them.
B001AGPD96|5|Direct fit!
B00JHOHBNY|3|no gasket, fit good
B00J6ZI4JE|5|Easy install
B00796UQHA|5|This is a great, very durable antenna. We bought one and put it on a 2010 Xterra 5 years ago, just recently got a 2015 Xterra and moved the antenna over and it still looks like new! On top of a nice product, they have great customer service too!
B00DY6FMMI|3|More of a net than a sun shade.  Fits loosely, could fit better.  I like it overall but not perfect.
B004AGCV8Y|5|These are among the best rotors for stock cars that money can buy.  Never worry about brakes squeaking anymore with their special coating.
B00U3XL2P6|5|This does what its supposed to.  However, it is a international unit so it cannot be updated on the with the US launch Tech software and no USA warranty.  I used it on my Mercedes C230 and it was able to read all systems, Engine, ABS and trans.
B006VFEJJQ|4|fits perfectly.  You need to get the wrench extension. It's less than $10 at a local hardware store.  It's worth.
B002JSYH14|1|Still having problems.  Getting it diagnosed to see if it's the transfer case motor,  or something else. The transfer case motor was defective. Replaced with a new one. Problem solved.
B00BCRMB34|4|[[VIDEOID:5731dae3be1f8e6403028fcfe24d72c6]] We recently purchased a 2013 Ford Focus with leather seats. We live in Florida, so that only means one thing..burned legs over 70% of the year!!  I have been on the market for seat covers to not only protect the leather, but also my legs.  I was so impressed with the fact that it came with seatbelt covers and a steering wheel cover! My husband did all of the installing of the covers.  We opted to not use the s-hooks that came with them. They still are very secure on our seat and don't slide, even without the hooks.  It took my husband a bit to get them on correctly, (bless his heart for being out in that Florida sun/heat to do it) but once he did I was very impressed. The fabric looked smooth and clean on the seats. The material seems thin but durable.  There are also covers for the headrests which I love.  The back seat was a little of a concern to me at first because we have a pull down arm rest/cup holder. We quickly saw that there was a zipper so that it could still be utilized and my back seats are protected! The only thing that could have made this product any better is if the cover of the back of the front seats would have a slot for the pockets. But, I could alter that by cutting slits, which I may do.  Overall, I was very pleased with these seat covers. They look great in my car and are perfect for what I need them for...to keep my legs protected and the seats protected from my boys! I would recommend these car seat covers to anyone who is in the market for car seat covers.  I received these covers at a discounted rate in exchange for honest, unbiased opinion.  All pictures, videos and opinions are my own.
B00TF3IXRA|5|using as a grow house light. so far they have burned out every powersource i plug them into due to being too high in wattage versus source
B0031I5Z80|5|Direct replacement for my 2003 Bonneville SSEi. good quality.
B00EHJZ7NU|5|Heard good things about this product got it in three vehicles have to give it time and see how well it works
B00KGIBXZM|4|Right part worked great
B003E7LJNI|5|The lines worked great. I had broke a rear line and yes, while it's difficult to fish the new lines in they worked wonderfully. Glad it's a full kit, when I test drove the Jeep for the rear line, I discovered my front line leaking as well. The front it much easier to install with the help of a second person. One in the front pushing the in, the other person to pull and help guide where it should go. I found it easier to install the driver side first for the front line. The overall quality is also great, the tubes could bend really far and not collapse or fold.
B000OCH8FO|5|A great little brush.  Works great and easy on the car.
B000OZSABW|5|Perfect fit seats look like brand new
B00ANZHG4U|5|Good buy for the price. I have not used more than five so far. The quality is great as well.
B006EGAIII|5|I used these to life the front end of my 2005 Chevy 2500HD with the Duramax motor.  The truck weighs about 7,000 pounds, with about 4,000 of that on the front axles.  These are sturdy, yet light and very portable.  I highly recommend.
B0045S6XHM|5|Excellent transaction, better then described.
B0048IZW2G|5|Works the way it is supposed to.
B0009IQZH0|5|nice
B0023VD6SM|5|I was happy with the product.  It fit perfectly and installed in about 5 minutes.
B00BTGSGL4|5|These make the best towels for our detail shop, Great prices, Last a long time, after repeated washes, they still perform great.
B00KTIE5VS|2|Remote looks good, but mine didn't work on my 2004 trailblazer, sadly. Is it because it didn't come with a remote before? I'm not sure if that's why it didnt. Someone tell me
B0055B0H0C|5|Work good
B002CCNOVG|2|Out of the box,  I loved it!  Nice heavy thick leather.  Loved the padding in the back. Lots of storage. Felt great.  After one week the front zipper broke.  No problem. I was able to repair it.  Second week, stitching is pulling apart of the pocket and it is falling apart.  I have no choice but to send it back.  Because I love the look I may give then a shot at sending another that hopefully will last.
B004V6QB9I|5|I got one of these to make moving my husband onto the front passenger seat of my car a little easier.  I kept it on my driver side and when I moved it into the house to use on a kitchen chair I missed the extra lift it provided so I bought my second one. My husband has dementia so once I get him seated, it is easier to turn him towards the table to eat. The bottom is slightly rubberized to grip and the top somewhat slippery, so it works for us. My car has leather upholstery - don't know how it would work on fabric.
B00062YOYU|4|good
B008KNALS0|1|Part gets warning light to go off, but does not work properly. Oil gets to the add level mark and does not warn you. Junk!!!!!
B00O6WPVXY|5|great
B006N39MVQ|5|Fit a 2001 vw jetta.
B001P6GONU|1|I have had this briefcase since March 2014. A few days ago, the interior came completely unglued so the entire back portion fell into  the briefcase. I do not know whether it can be glued again. It is only 17 months old.
B005WER25U|1|Cheaply made and don't fit 2012 z71 1500 seats no matter how you try to make it work.
B000KITSMI|5|great tool
B005HF3BWW|5|Perfect
B000IY4A2W|5|Nicely finished rotor fits and works, weighs more than the stocker, doesn't warp like one.  Good buy.
B000CIPE9M|5|7 Month update: Still loving this product and getting plenty of compliments when others notice it.  Has held up great, looks good  Highly recommend this item!<br /><br />Really love this product so far.  The install was pretty straight-forward and it looks so much nice (IMO) than a spray on bed liner.  This is not a work truck so I have no plans to haul lumber, rocks, tools, etc. with any regularity thus I won't be able to review durability for those needs.  For a personal vehicle I think this a  great product that will allow me to move furniture, TV's, etc. without damaging the product and having to using moving blankets or other items to prevent my truck from damaging the items. The carpet is easy to clean and I haven't had a problem washing or vacuuming it out.  I have a tonneau cover so this doesn't have exposure to sun light often so I have no feedback on UV durability, but is does remain cool when I have the cover open and haul things around.  The fit of the bed liner is pretty close to perfect.  You certainly don't need to pay someone to do the install, but do take note of the location of any tie downs that you plan to put back after the install as you will need to poke some holes in the bed liner to get at them and it can be difficult to locate them if you don't have a pretty good idea of where they are.
B00005BZ98|4|very cool- It DOES get stuck. So when the train gets stuck, just SHAKE IT. (and teach your kids to do the same so they don't get angry)
B00904WS84|4|I dont ride without it .. I enjoy the coat very much
B00K1C1WC2|1|Very cheap not sure they even get home garage job done!
B001ED3S38|5|Cute fits perfectly. I love it!
B001C6Q34S|5|A little less dense than the OEM Subaru filter, but otherwise fine. Good quality OEM replacement. Don't let the dealer swap you filter for you. Anybody can do it and requires no tools to complete the job.
B00E9SVFXK|5|Despite a few crashes, it has never torn.  Cool and comfortable!
B00C8C6IEK|5|Great quality and great price!  I used this along with a BAFX products scan tool to check my 2010 Mercedes Sprinter transmission fluid level after a diy transmission service.  (found out I was a liter low on fluid so you really need this tool)  And super fast delivery too!  Thanks so much!
B00FOOV40W|4|Works as intended would have given 5 stars but it lacks instructions.
B001TE0IMG|5|Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended.
B000QFN3DU|5|I bought this to line the inside of my lower race fairing on my 2006 CBR1000RR. I had previously used another brand of heat-shield tape and it wasn't doing the trick. Even with the exhaust wrapped and the other heat-shield tape on the lower fairing the paint was bubbling and discoloring. With this tape I no longer have the problem.<br /><br />This tape seems to be much thicker and the extra thickness seems to be for the insulation layer of the tape.<br /><br />As far as the adhesive goes it seems to be adhering well but some of the edges have needed to be pressed back down. The other thinner tape I used in the past has the same issue. I'm sure the problem is that if they make it too sticky you'll never get it off.<br /><br />As far as my needs go it is working perfectly.
B000CSWCAG|5|worked perfectly, strong smell but ultimately effective
B0033DOKX4|5|Had no issues. Was a direct fit. Very cheap price than buying locally. Arrived as expected.
B004RCRS9I|5|Big brush, works fine
B00XZ9N00K|5|Excellent
B004GFS2C8|5|Just got a new windshield installed and on the drive home got a chip. After calming down for intense road rage I looked up this kit and decided to give it a try. Depending on the severity of the chip, this really works. Wish I would have taken pictures.
B00KLL1T5I|1|The break pads are not good. I installed but couldn't keep because of noise.
B001FZL9ZO|5|looks great and is fun to use as a seat or a step
B00BNEXJ28|5|Way stiffer and stronger than other stands I have had in the past + I flipped the handle to forward position so I can hold the bars with one hand while lifting and lowering with the other.  One of those ideas that when you use it you wonder why all stands don't work like this.
B00IOKMEQ6|5|we have three cats and hair gets everywhere. This magical stone grabs all that unwanted hair quickly and easily. This works so well that the neighbors have purchased some for themselves. They also last forever as there's nothing to wear out.
B000I0ZA4S|3|It worked okay, but I had to rent an additional set from O'reily's because in order to compress the struts to unbolt the strut on my car a third one was needed. Also, doing the rear strut on my car wold have been impossible with these because the space in the wheel well was so tight on my car. The hooks with the wing nuts were cheap and almost like it was added after manufacturing for safety reasons. The coil springs are very dangerous! Having the extra set of spring compressors I rented was well worth it to.
B008LTJOX6|5|I used three of these so far with no issues at all.
B004F63RYQ|5|I have a convertible and when I have the top down I don't like my purse/handbag sitting on the seat next to me out in the open where anyone walking by can reach in and grab it. So I tried this organizer out and love it. It sits behind the passenger seat on the floor, and holds a small collapsible umbrella, hand wipes, and also my medium-size purse/handbag. Small little items like hand satirizer easily fit into the mesh side. This little car organizer is great!
B00J9QG4VU|5|Excellent product.
B000IG5PZQ|5|Well pleased , works fine !!!!!!...John
B001C1ZN8U|5|Love it and it fits perfect.
B0006IX7Y2|5|Using with our sewer line for our 5th wheel camper.  Don't know what else to say except that it holds our sewer line.  It seems to be very lightweight.  It is compact in storage in the underbelly.  It is currently stretched rather far and have not had any problems with it breaking.
B007XZK7F8|5|The new headlights look great! It was easy to put in, and I didn't even have to adjust them.
B003TPW5YM|5|Suds up a lot, but I feel that it works a little better when you use a little more than recommended per gallon. I use this for two bucket style car washing and the gallon size makes it economical. This gallon size will last me a long time.<br /><br />The cherry scent smells really nice and makes the water a light pink/red. Washes off well and leaves a squeaky clean surface. Doesn't smell like chemicals masked by perfumes like some other car washes.
B004A344EQ|5|great little table, old school style
B0040CVT54|2|Larger flat head than OEM but snap and fitment is fine.
B001DUDUU8|3|Decent quality. You need to take the axle off to install. I cut them in 1/2 to get them on. No problem with install yet
B002B3N7HC|5|this is a great product i have it in my car for under dash lights and it works great, 6 channels to put lights everywhere and 10 light functions are great, the key fob works from a good distance away so u can be out of your vehicle and control the lights, very easy to set up, only down side is that i find the key fob is a little easy to press so you have to watch turning it on in your pocket
B00THR39SC|4|Bought these to use on my 04 Avalanche. The quality seems to be pretty good and the fact that they are paint ready is a plus (although I decided to leave them as they are). These flares came with the required amount of pins and easy to use double sided 3M tape. I did find that I had to remove my factory mud flaps in order to install. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to do just a very small bit of trimming on the inside in order for the flare to fit flush with the contours of the truck body.  Not much, just a bit, but otherwise a great buy and made the truck look even better!  Please note that I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B00VA5N26S|3|Have not used it yet  nice flashlight can't rate it  good or bad
B00GSAUHB8|5|Keeps your car cool! I live in Houston, where the summers are almost unbearable, and this makes it possible to get in your car, and not melt. Great product.
B007TY4STY|5|Just what I needed and it saved me about $600.
B004R2Y64S|5|Product works as advertised.  Arrived about a week ahead of scheduled delivery date.  Took about an hour to install.  Looks great on my Mazda5.  There is a small amount of wind noise at highway speeds, but nothing I cannot deal with.  One great feature of these bars over others I've seen is that they have a rubber strip on the top, which helps protect bars and the things I'm carrying, plus help hold items from slipping around.
B01093PU2K|5|I put this Gelepad in my car where my knee always hits on the console. It's saved me a lot of pain and strain. It's amazing how it stays put even in 110-degree heat!
B005T7JQ4A|5|Took a chance that these would be the right size and look for my STS - they are fantastic.  They look so close to factory and do not have that over-done &#34;bling&#34; look.  Great price and fast delivery just make this a 100% winner!
B00LLJ6COW|5|Good cut out<br />Clear and neat
B00774U6HY|5|Great deal installed in secounds
B00QR4UMC4|5|I can count on these brakes.
B00MZLTCBU|2|Cute keychain,  but very flimsy Feeling Like It Could Break Easily
B00ITE85GA|5|I put this on the back door of my Excursion and will be ordering a pair for the front fenders to go next to the Excursion emblem... Solid chrome, best emblem I have ever came across.
B000VBZCKG|5|Happy Hubby!
B0027QWNGO|5|Great product at a great price. It's big and looks great.
B0101SLT5U|5|I absolutely love this product. I put it around my ignition ring on my 2015 jeep compass and it adds that extra touch of bling that expresses my personality. I will definitely recommend this to a friend.
B009FUF6DM|5|They do a good job cleaning things.
B006GLA8TA|2|Does not cover as much as I thought it would I still see some of the rocker panel so it still gets scratched kind of disappointed for the quality for a Mopar part they don't make them like they used to
B00Q3NCUL0|5|Let me make this perfectly clear, These are a pain in the a** to install. They come with no method of installing the bars and unless you want to do some crazy wiring you will have wires everywhere. Other negatives are they have no way of daisy chaining the bars so unless you want to put the box in the middle of the car you will have to extend the wires. The remote sucks, it has a horrible range and it is made of cheap plastic so if it does break your screwed because you have no way of hard wiring even an on/of switch. I actually ended up just soldering the 2 antennas together. So why was my rating so high? The wires are made of copper so making adjustments to them is fairly easy even if you don't know how to solder. The bars them selves work well and are quite robust. The remote does work and because I mounted it and the power box inside the car it has a lot less chance of breaking. Even though it took a long time to install and everything other than the bars appears to be cheap they work quite well as long as you are quite careful to do a good job installing them. And the best part about these and the main reason they get 5 stars is that they are very cheap.
B00XQ0ZEL6|5|Good product
B00HJ6TYJ6|4|Does shine the dull fiberglass (once you've cleaned it) of our 20 year old shower but doesn't repel water.  It will need to be reapplied every 6-8 weeks..
B010G0QTC6|1|Well I was hesitant to purchase this tool as there are no reviews. Went a head and bought it any way. When it arrived the company only sent the polisher and forgot to send me the 6 piece  buffing pad set. I opened the box and the u shaped handle was defective. Its made out of real light weight cheap plastic. I guess if you were to use it the straight handle would hold up better.For its size the polisher is heavy. I plugged it in and it was very noisy running. Sent it back and  ended up the next day going to Harbor freight and buying almost the same product but I would say a little nicer for $49.00. I wouldn't recommend this one for the price. The other guy that post a review right before me I suspect might work for tcp global.
B00021XQLC|5|Good straps. We use them in our trucking business and they seem to last.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Used it On my leather couch. Works great.
B007KGYYY0|5|What can I say about a cv boot. It's a cv boot and it fit the truck.
B001G7E3Z4|3|Can't use it. Doesn't fit too late to return it, tossed it into recycle bin. Get from junk yard.
B00SZK26T0|5|Install is always dumb on my honda accord for having to take the entire front bumper off, but besides that, easy install. simply putting the new bulb in. drastastic change from old to new headlights. They are a very bright white. I will be trying them out tonight for the first time to see how good they do, will edit review with updated information! sorry that one picture is rotated lol.
B00DT82INW|4|Very nice
B008FR35GQ|5|Great price and very fast shipping. Will do business with you again. A+
B00V7AW1FY|5|Easy simple install takes about 15 minutes
B007IVS93Y|5|Great mirrors. Too bad that Dodge sells a truck with tow package, and poor mirrors. Thes are exact oem mirrors that should have been on the rig when it was sold.
B001KSGO4M|1|Extremely disappointed, purchased new front and rear rotors, wheel bearings and these pads for my 2009 Honda Accord EX Sedan. These pads make more noise then my old worn out OEM Honda pads. Backing out of spots, and slow braking are the worst in terms of noise. What a pieces of garbage wagner made! Will be forced to pay for new pads and labor!
B00OKLTCOU|1|did not fit
B00DRZXRO6|5|Great product
B002J7KDZO|5|Great towels!!!! Absorbs fast!!  The whipes grab onto water, and muddy paws. Dries well too. Would recommend for small doggies.
B0002SRG4S|5|Tough as nails, and SUPER handy.  I love that the hammer screw-on is actually pretty short.  I don't like using a hammer on pickle forks when they're a foot long or so.  This lets you get into tight spaces and still have room and angle to swing a mallet or hammer.  Also, the air attachment obviously makes things VERY handy.
B000C75NPI|5|Great fit
B008GH4WEY|4|good
B000WK1K7U|5|Great
B0076AU0YS|5|The sound as with the original!!!!
B0050DC604|5|Plug & Play just like it says, worked great for my 2010 goldwing. The hardest part was trying to find room to stuff the wiring into the framework so the rear panel would fit back on.
B0009PCPNQ|5|It takes out everything ive come across in my car. Pop, coffee, mustard, mud and dirt, even blood.<br />I love it and am making this my go to cleaner for my car seats and carpet.
B001JT5NMQ|5|Sure tests the tire pressure (and skull strength) very effectively.
B0002MADZ8|5|perfect match to original
B00HVVVEYM|5|Just drove for 2 days in the rain with suitcases in  this. Nice and dry. Well made. Heavy material. I have no complaints.
B00HB2LP8Q|2|They look great and work good but the lenses start to fall off. This is my second pair and it would be nice to just perches lenses.
B00KV8MS6U|5|Awesome lights for great price.
B009S31WQG|5|This did fit fine on my 2006 Ford Fusion right side rear passenger door. The plastic bit the the cable connects to had broken and this worked and look the same as the original OEM handle.
B00G2586NK|4|Seems to work very well, water pressure slightly less than normal but thats to be expected since it is filtering water. Get the flexible hose protecter to go with it! Well worth it!
B007P05FBW|3|Misread the description,  didn't fit my king cab...
B0006HP9ZS|5|Been using these for years in my car and never had any issues.
B000A7BMKK|4|Excellent
B00ITZ7EP2|1|Well it was a bear to install and it just went bad, now I need another. It's not just frustrating, it's really dissapointing to see the Remy brand so degraded and used. These brands used to represent American quality. Now we get to have the residual pride associated with our father's employers used to sell us junk.
B004TOB6EW|5|Works great, easy to haul, nice build quality
B000JJMGPY|4|Ok fit
B000BUU5YU|5|will always go with Camco!
B005FKMUQW|5|Went on easy with the directions that was sent with product. Came with all needed parts. Had to use the old brake pad clips. The ones that were sent did not fit in the calipers. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase.
B001THXAR8|5|These headlight were easy to install and work great.  I am very happy with them.
B00EQ9FSEO|5|I installed this on my CBR 250R stock windshield. I immediately noticed a significant improvement in the comfort because the wind blast was directed  out of my face over the top of my helmet. This makes extended riding less tiring and increases the maximum comfortable speed by 20 mph for me. I can easily ride at freeway speeds and beyond with minimal buffeting. I strongly  suggest permanent mounting over clamping once you are sure you want to keep it. There was significant force on the edge of the stock windshield causing a noticeable bend when it was clamped on.
B00L1CL32A|5|Fit just fine and the brakes work well.
B00GBVHQB8|5|Great gloves for the price. I took a rock to the knuckle at 60mph and didn't feel a thing. Would definitely want something warmer for those cold days though.
B003O0YO0U|5|These fit perfect for my 2004 MDX
B00E63TI32|5|thank you
B0097IECXM|5|Works Great!! A huge thank you to Rice Toyota for shipping it so quickly and getting it to me well within teh timeframe that I needed it.
B000KTKSNK|1|Item would have required a full length cut to fit hood.  Either was the wrong item, or not custom as described.
B00D9NBQH6|1|it does not fit my car as stated...  Please send correct size item...
B001UP0ENM|4|It was easy to replace (with the help of a youtube.com video).  Works great, although I had to file down the tip of the key that came with it because it didn't go in very smoothly.  After I did that, it works fine.
B00ALH4B0M|2|I cleaned the area after I removed the old emblem and when I reattached the new one it didn't perfectly match the curve of the car so it's a little lop-sided. I tried pushing it with a lot of pressure but it still would not completely attach and now when I press on it you can feel it wobble. It's very nice and matches the original but the attachment is not great.
B00OZ1GKI6|5|it arrived to my house super fast and quality is excellent
B003CSNCUC|5|Towed a 7500 lbs travel trailer behind a GMC Yukon Denali XL over the Continental Divide.  Brake controller worked great, the ability to manually apply the trailer breaks was great on the downhill side allowing me to keep speed low while going around the bends.  Mounting was simple, wiring was easy with a little instruction from YouTube.
B000BUU5WW|5|Works quite well and stores easily.
B00316K61S|5|Works great, nice addition to my test equipment.
B001PLBV4W|3|Not very bright.
B00GI77I3G|5|Nice color lighting!!!
B005DCKRP8|5|Love! it! blingy!! Enough on my black BMW PERFECT!!
B005JU5XE4|5|Covers the whole area. Quiet and smooth. AAAAA+++++
B005ESEU8G|5|Very nice heavy made product. Easy install.
B00ACQBE1Q|5|Perfect.  Delivered quick!  Exactly what I ordered!  Thank you!
B0083SL82A|5|Nice
B00BUQ5ZL2|5|My husband had put up with a defective switch for years until it finally gave out altogether. He was really happy to receive this and have it work perfectly.
B001EOV492|5|High quality product!!
B00GRHRTEU|5|A legal must in Illinois and it is tough to back up or change lanes with the doors off and no mirrors.
B001GRSSQ4|5|Nice custom fit on my mustang.
B00SHLP0ZE|5|Got tried of the trunk lid coming down when a wind blew and finally remembered to order these. Product was here a week earlier than promised and was so easy to install my wife was wondering if I even  had time to do it. Less time to replace than fill the gas tank.
B00I98YCN6|3|Nice item, but does not fit the 08 Mini Cooper S.  It is way to big and the light is at the bottom on the car not the top as on this item.
B0055B121U|5|FITS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL FACTORY PART. RUNS AND IDLES A LOT SMOOTHER NOW. INSTALLED ON A 2004 COLORADO.
B0051D3MP6|5|Excellent product. Keeps my motorcycle charged and ready
B00JRE6APE|5|It's awesome.
B00B4KPDEI|5|Perfect replacement for my 08 Silverado. At 80K miles not sure if they need replacing but it gives me peace of mind and you can’t beat the Amazon price. They are VERY simple to replace yourself. If in doubt there are videos youtube that help.
B00GEW6MVE|5|Perfect.  Exactly as described.  Colors are perfect.
B00WF93KTW|4|We liked the set up, however it was not what we needed. I have returned the product for ONLY that reason
B006V7TBBA|4|Looks great on our 2004 Wrangler TJ. Fairly easy install. A little disappointed on all the plastic (the KC on front is a little to soft plastic for my preference), but looks nice and hope it lasts. Bright and works as expected.
B000NWA6T0|5|Direct OEM replacement takes about 10 minutes to remove and install
B000W7GLB8|5|Great Fit... very nice looks and works perfectly.
B000M8OYNE|5|very good. I have one in all three of my vehicles
B000XQ0WTK|5|Good tool
B00CS8SNY2|4|Had to do a little &#34;adjusting&#34; but it works and is comfortable on our older Kubota.
B00TBHXC4E|4|I use this on the bumper fender and side panels on a 2002 Ford Ranger.  This cleaned the Vinyl panels nicely.  Just spray on and use some elbow grease.  Removed a lot of old road dirt and grime.<br />My only complaint is the spray bottle, I would prefer a continuous spray that was easier to aim and hit specific parts, but that's just my personal preference.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|This product delivers as promised. So handy, especially when I have a passenger. Keeps my purse and other items accessible and safe.
B000CKPHZQ|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B001B57D26|1|too expensive for a rusty cap and made in china
B001O0AMZS|1|Didn't fit
B001GKQZQG|5|Works perfect . Well constructed material. Great for a 3rd brake light application . Very happy . Only sticky tape mounting
B003E1ZIC2|5|Very good pad ,would purchase again.3M products are the best
B0023VFB2G|1|The connector for the wiring harness was installed on the wrong side. It uses a plastic press fitting and should be installed on the INSIDE of the tab, the product I received had the connector press fit on the OUTSIDE of the tab, which caused the assembly not to fit. It interfered with the bed and I had to break the plastic press fitting and relocate the connector to the correct position. Piss poor performance by the manufacture. Very unhappy.
B002FUR5FG|2|Bad craftsmanship. Welds on the inside are not smooth. Placement of MAF sensor hole is too far away, so cable is now really thight. Shield needs cutting or bending, since it's interfering with a bracket. Should've gone with the K&N 69-8757 kit. Had a K&N kit before in another car and it fit perfect.
B000CO9Q68|5|Worked Great on the 68 Camaro.  Slightly made up for sagging springs even.  Rides great.  Easy to install. Perfect fit.
B0043DYCAY|1|Ordered for 3in pipe for my truck  the clamps I got wouldn't even fit on the 2.25 pipe on my car. Sending them back for a refund.
B003N302D6|5|Fits perfect .
B00XU70H7G|2|not the same as OEM, still attempting to get my return finalized
B004X5QPI4|5|Shipping was fantastic radiator fit perfectly
B000IYLZDO|4|part was a direct replacement but my truck didn't have the connecting plug on the main harness so had to cut it off and splice the wires. Works perfectly and so does the cruise control
B000DZXIME|5|Good quality
B00829RHE8|5|Great
B001I1F11S|5|WAS THE RIGHT EXACT SIZE FOR MY CRUZE AT A LOW PRICE!!!! LOVE IT!!
B004JBOXJU|4|good fit and seems similar to o.e.m
B00K74STWK|5|My daughter just moved to college and put her car cover on, we are not sure yet if it really works good. The cover was thick material. We will see.
B00KIP5JPS|5|Its perfect for me i love the fact of a key and opener all in one
B000C53Q9K|4|Good price
B00IA5QD26|5|great product
B00JX2U0ZG|5|Good quality, look great, and came with four bulbs (two extra!!). Highly recommended.
B00BQYCIVI|5|Great car detail wipe towels.
B00804F080|5|So amazing...can't get any better than that😃
B0051D3MP6|4|So far it has been doing the job. No complaints.
B005EZILIE|4|The actual product works and looks very well.
B000CQRME4|5|Nice quality brakes with clips as well. Work great and no issues.
B00YV5D4B2|4|Fit great  thanks
B001GEO0ZA|4|They do what they do as they should do.
B00MTHPAN4|5|I am very happy with this item thank you
B00U85H9G0|5|Great
B00GWFKT26|5|Love it.  Fits great on my 2015 Tacoma DCSB. I do wish the passenger side would extend higher into the foot area and the sides are higher. I would but them again, but I doubt I have to seeing the quality.
B00OZQHFTY|1|So disappointed. These were just stickers on a blank plastic frame and the design was terrible. The stormtroopers didn't even have mouths!!
B000CPAVJ8|4|Fast shipping.. Just its a hot pink its not like the picture.
B00AJ5DCOW|5|Awesome
B000GV95G8|5|Great quality and less than HD ones. I'm very particular about the products I put on my Harley Davidson. I'm always looking for products that match its original equipment quality feel and these fit the bill.
B00LO20530|5|Item is as good as offered ... Thanks
B000CN7J0O|4|I didn't buy it for my truck but my dad's I had a set that was a bit better in quality.  What I do like about these is that it starts from the side mirror.  That's pretty much it, doesn't have a rain channel for rain to travel on not that it's important but it's just a bonus addition.  Also.. it says tapeless, yes you can install it without tape but it's recommended you should use tape not by the manufacture but me.  My dad's passenger almost fell off thank goodness my brother was on the passenger seat and was able to hold on to it.  Great look I recommend it but you'll need to get your own double sided tape and make it right the first time ;)
B00N6QGQWG|5|Great quality material and graphics !!!
B000ALG86E|5|The cover was purchased used.  It came in perfect condition.  Although the cover was purchased to cover a Mini, it is big enough to cover my Saab sedan.  I am extremely please with the product and value of the item.
B004SJUFH2|5|Easy to attached and nice looking.  Reasonable price
B00HCQA8Q6|4|Just what we were looking for, they look great on our 2015 Chevy Silverado. The only thing I would change is for the mounting brackets to be a little more heavy duty. But overall they look and function great!
B004L6AAUE|5|Excellent product and seller.
B006WQSESQ|5|The hub and Bearing assembly is a great product for the price and was easy for my mechanic to install in no time.
B000JZD8LY|1|i had to send it back because it didn't look like nothing on the description the bushing was too small which causes clunks when i start to drive off
B000N3CP7A|5|Great price fast delivery
B001C92VU0|5|I don't think i can say anything bad about them
B002N5PP8W|5|Worked great for my new 3&#34; rv sewer system
B000ALJ4NS|1|hardener wouldnt come out of cylinder<br />hard as cement from factory
B00RZXYC18|4|Good quality
B00O9V57FE|5|Thing works great, i have it wired to my 200watt eyourlife roof light bar on my polaris ranger. Nice set up
B002BJEG3U|4|good
B00EKTI8TM|5|Love these covers. Its been a couple months and they have made it through 4 car washes and look great. Look like factory grade.
B000N37FIY|5|Can now take spare air with me when I take my mower to another property.
B00EP3PTF4|4|Mounted these on a 2015 Ram 1500. Installation was fairly easy and they look good. Plenty of clearance for mudflaps. My only gripe is they don/t mount to the frame of the truck, they mount (2 supports on each side) to the rocker panels. Not much of a problem if your light on your feet but they do flex noticeably if your 250 lbs and step on them. To be sure, the nerf bars don't flex, your rocker panels do.
B002V8735E|5|Worked out great when my original remote died on me. Easy to program!
B004PBXUDY|1|Do not buy.. abt the 2nd ride my running light quit working got caught in rain so it's not weatherproof total piece of junk.. and abt my 6th ride the licence plate light quit working to so far I have just brake light and turn signals. Just waiting for when they go out.
B000W0KTMW|5|I've had this for two years and two winters now. it's still going strong. I park my bike outside year round. This has stood the test of time and weather. I've had to put some lubricant in it a few times, but other than that a great lock at a great price.
B009WQ3JFQ|5|I was debating between husky and weather tech. I chose the husky after reading the reviews about the materials used. I was concerned about foot fatigue with the harder plastic. These liners are made of softer msterial and whick i like for preventing ankle pain. The husky floor mat fits my truck very well I live in the country with a gravel driveway and have live stock so I was concerned about mud and manure on the carpet and so far I am very pleased. I would purchase theses again.
B004C6OBBC|5|Works great.
B0009IQXXG|3|3 stars as the shine is not that hot! Didn't expect this is Meguiar's. Did the job on instant shine when wet, but not impress when dried. Blackened your tires for couple of days.
B004O42CTU|1|nope...couldn't get my scala rider to work... customer service SUCKED!
B00IWOZ4GQ|4|Haven't installed it, but it looks like the one that is on the car
B00O5MVFZI|3|It does what it needs to, but not the best. The main screw which connects to the Tow hole always gets loose. Ends up making the license plate swing left and right so its never straight. Due to this it actually scratched my front bumper. As of right now I don't use it. I have it in my car tho just in case I need to go to an area that makes me need to put a plate on.
B00JRE38EA|3|LED DOES NOT FIT IN ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS QUOTED ON THE SITE.
B0002NILKG|5|Holds Myers
B008BMQYGI|5|Love'em!
B001DRM8FY|4|So a few things on the install.<br /><br />First, get the bolts that attach to the exhaust pipe (lower bolts) from honda.  You should be able to reuse your springs, but the bolts will most likely be shot, and the ones it comes with don`t work right.<br /><br />Second, get a can of pb blaster and liberally apply it to every bolt that will be coming off.  Be careful as it may cause a fire if you spray it on while the parts are too hot.<br /><br />Third, assemble the entire unit to check the fitment of parts before you take your old exhaust manifold out.  Also it will be easier to take some bolts out while the unit is still warm (but don`t try and touch the old manifold while it is very hot or it will burn you).<br /><br />fourth, a haynes manual will come in handy for torque specs and steps to take apart/reassemble.  When you take the old unit out take pictures and keep track of your bolts.  While the new one will have some hardware, some is reused.<br /><br />fifth, after the old unit is out, you should put both the O2 sensors into the new one (I didn`t replace either O2 Sensor, but it is advised that you do).  They are harder to put in once the manifold is in the car.
B004A2IFII|5|Awesome service. Quick delivery. Install was quick and simple. Will order again when I service my fuel filters again.
B00J00X5YO|5|My go to motor oil.  Never had a problem with my any of my cars ('05 '13 Accord and '12 Fit and '08 civic).  I went from 3K to 7.5K oil change intervals.
B00CXADGQ0|5|Used them for the dome and map lights on a 2000 Mustang. These are nice and bright. A bit bluish, but I hated the stock yellow lights so the change is great. Much easier to see things.<br /><br />They were a bit loose initially, as these were a bit slimmer than my stock light bulbs. I just wrapped some aluminum foil around the ends to get a nice snug fit. Has been working great for 7 months.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Doesnt quite fit the window but it still sticks and stays up so thats all I could ask for.
B00GM859O6|2|Nice concept, but the attachment process is horrible, the cinching mechanism put on backwards (as correctly described by others), and the ends won't stay put in the corner where the tailgate normally closes against the truck bed.  It's probably just a bad or inadequate set of instructions.  It's quite heavy duty so that's the only reason it's not a 1-star.  Be careful not to close it on your hands else you'll get a blood blister, too.  sigh.
B00AQ29GA2|5|Came how I expected them to be and fast delievery 👍🏼
B00BFDFP60|5|Great OEM cap. What more can you ask for, it works
B00JDN73P0|5|Perfect fit, quick delivery
B00HV6TKRA|1|only 1 set of lights work. on both bulbs
B00REQVA34|3|It definetly lights up more of the road then stock bulb. High beam isn't much different then low beam. I have had a lot of on coming traffic flash there brights lights  at me . Really lights up reflective signs along the road. Just did a 5000 mi. trip out west and it seems to work well.
B004BBNOL6|5|This is the only brand my husband will use!
B00AC6SAZE|5|Used Road King Microphones since 1979, the  headset meets my expectations.
B00ELR3YO2|5|They fit my prius like a glove. I love my hatchback now.
B00914H14O|5|just what i needed
B009082VDC|5|exellent rack for light to medium construction use.  Fits any size truck,  i use it on my toyota tacoma w/ 6' bed and can easily haul 16' material.
B000C2ZKG0|5|Its for use on Explorer with Rotella 5-40 synthetic oil says good to 15000 mi but I change every 5000 with synthetic oil.
B007FIUBW2|5|couldnt locate part anywhere in town, had it ordered in five minutes,only 41$, including 3 bulbs, awesome deal,and it arrived on time
B000KKOGLO|5|Works excellent!. Good price!. Easy to install.
B003TU6066|5|I have completely covered the interior of my 65 Corvette, I still need to add the new jute underlayment and new carpet. I have a radically camed engine and I'll put a killer system in with 10&#34; sub included. I'll write an update on how it all sounds when I'm done. The FatMat went on very well and it looks like it will stay on.
B002MB8T26|1|Pos. Found a longer cheaper better made one at Walmart.
B001A7RP32|5|I have one of these in gray but I wanted one in s***e which would match my RV's color better. Fits very good and is easy to set up.
B004I18L6C|5|Purchased this when my G6's headlight wiring/connectors become too rusted/eroded to function properly any longer. With this and the help of a Haynes repair manual, I was able to replace it myself with no trouble. It fit perfectly and functions just like the the original. When I have to purchase one for the driver's side, I know exactly where to purchase it from!
B00FALVTX6|5|I am gonna keep this short and sweet....best stuff I have ever used to keep our cars shiny and clean!  I wash them, dry them, then spray this awesome goop on my car and buff it off and it shines like new.  The smell is awesome as well.  Another win for Chemical Guys!
B003FBV8ZW|5|Very comfortable motorcycle goggles.  Padding around eyes is soft, and the ear piece is snug but also still comfortable.  The yellow really helps with night vision.
B00GDGS9SA|5|It is amazing and looks better than the photo, it worth the price and fit my 4 series very well, the car looks more beautiful with that cover
B00CMOVIQM|5|Fit my 2008 Nissan Maxima just fine, looks good too. These are the rear ones BTW.
B0095MW0IE|1|It's not good !
B0039Z3SUM|3|Installed in front dash of 01 TJ. I replaced the stock speakers with upgraded aftermarket ones, but still wasn't satisfied with the tinny, hollow sound. So, I decided to try these. Based on some of the reviews, and a few Jeep forum suggestions saying something like this would help, I decided to try them.<br /><br />Installation was super easy; anybody can do it. But, I didn't notice any improvement in sound quality or speaker performance. They haven't hurt anything, but they certainly haven't helped. Now, back to the drawing board...
B007V2BFQ8|5|Good quality, but have to be careful because you can bend the inner cardboard.  Looks great with a Kodiak brown, black, or gray car.
B003OC1S6G|5|Very good quality and cool retro look for my 87 Porsche
B004EIDD2Q|5|worked real good on a snow and icy day
B00FYKTXBI|5|A+
B001GRM64O|5|Fit as advertised. Seller communication was  good. I was contacted by email by an actual person concerned about a possible fitment issue before shipment, generic application codes seems to be an ongoing problem with amazon/weathertech.
B00480FHJC|2|Bulb lasted about 5 minutes... lol I know not to touch the glass while installing, and was careful not to. I installed it in my GSX-R 600 (04 model) and the bulb worked for a few minutes while the bike was idling warming up. It burned out before I even left the driveway! I stopped at a local auto parts store and bought another bulb, some over-priced no-name bulb, and it's still working after a few hundred miles. Maybe I just got a dud with this one, but it wasn't worth asking for a return/exchange.
B00ZE5RGTY|4|[[VIDEOID:f58b73fc4f01e3560dda4ef5dcc4dc19]] Please watch the video for specifics<br /><br />I think in some cars it might be too slim but those you probably can reach what gets dropped easier so it shouldn't matter as much.<br /><br />The baby on board sticker is a nice bonus IF you have a baby, I do not.<br /><br />The phone pad...man it is sticky all over! It leaves no residue but I don't know how it would fair in a sealed car over a really long time...like most things it might (likely will) degrade but this is in a situation where the vehicle is in direct sunlight and rarely driven. If this applies to you remove the unit when not in use. Warm soapy water will clean it if...when needed. As you can see some phones won't work well and other phones will. If you have a larger heavier phone don't expect much.<br /><br />Overall it might be better in thought than in use but the pockets which I think are really the focus do the job intended.<br /><br />4 stars...certainly there is room for improvement. Maybe some velcro to keep them from sliding around or maybe some different sizes to accommodate different gaps in vehicles.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.
B000ER46RM|5|Wonderful Decal.  I have it right next to my EVOLVE fish on my car and they are an awesome accessory to the fellow humanist and Darwinian supporter.
B000E3EXH4|5|Worked great with my Honda Odyssey's interior.
B004R34HDC|5|I purchased this rack because it appeared well made and durable. I also bought the extension section to have more room to get 3 people's gear up there for long hunting trips in my 04 4Runner. The rack fits perfectly on the top, the back hatch door opens with no interference, and the brackets to attach to the cross bars are solid. assembling the rack with extension IS a pain in the backside, but I got through it with only minor cussing in about an hour. Every thing went together pretty good, slight mis-alignment on a couple of the screw holes. I added a 32&#34; curved New Brights LED light bar, and you can see from the pictures, it looks like it was made for the curve of the rack. I installed the light bar with Modify Street brackets made for 1 1/2&#34; tubing and it works great. I'm real happy with the whole package. I can't really say how much wind noise just the rack would produce, but with the light bar installed- you'll need to turn up the radio at highway speeds! But on the other hand, it LIGHTS UP the night.
B006LJAX74|1|Although motor fit was reverse wired. Returned
B001TLC12E|3|Does not fit my 2003 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.
B0097IE926|4|Maybe Toyota cheaped out?  New rug seems short on all 4 ends by 1/2&#34;.  Also seems much lighter in materials than my showroom new rug had 3 years ago.  Overall very pleased
B006IC6Q1Q|5|good price
B00XCOPJRA|5|So far has been working great! I love just being able to glance at the tires and know that the tire pressure is adequate instead of guessing.
B003YLMPPA|5|Did the trick and restored all my fan speeds.  Good item
B00RED9KP2|1|Luckily these were cheap because it failed to mention that it was for flat surfaces anyway. It's a thick carbon fiber that does not bend easily. The pink is a pretty color but if you have a surface that bends that you're trying to cover, buy carbon fiber through a dealership.
B00HRHWHNW|5|Good price for good product.
B003O0YO0U|5|Strong as advertised....good product!
B00L1TOYGU|5|Perfect
B00LIRVV2K|5|Easy to install took me about 5 mins. Each side to remove old and install new ones looks great and works great so far
B000WJ7QEC|5|Got it to replace the toy tools that came with my new Yamaha.  I'll probably never need this. I got this because I stopped to help a fellow biker stranded at the side of the road who rode a custom bike and didn't have anything to work with.  That's when I saw my paltry set of tools for the first time and saw how pathetic and incomplete they are.
B0077K8O2M|5|Pricy now that oil products are twice cheaper.
B00VJ4LHUS|4|It worked for what we needed, a small compact trash bag that travels. Even better, a space for tissues or wipes! Thanks!
B000GD5FMY|5|Nice glasses
B00NON1VDA|5|Bought this light bar back in the spring and attached to my 1993 Ford Bronco.  Attached it to the windshield visor on the truck with the included mounts, but replaced the standard hex-head nuts with lock nuts and 2&#34; fender washers.  The light does come with a pigtail and harness, but I ended up cutting mine off because of its bulky size and the routing I had to take and never saw the need to re-attach it.  LOVE the results! It's incredibly bright, so bright to where I can't tell I have my regular headlights on. Didn't take mine apart beforehand and add extra silicone--so far this hasn't been an issue for me, and I've driven with it on and off through some pretty heavy Michigan rains.
B004AU3HT2|5|Looks great
B00H27JMEE|5|Appears to be good quality.
B00GZ88SLE|5|I have been installing HID kits in all of my cars for a number of years. The quality of light even with stock reflectors is far superior to halogen and it makes driving with plain ol' halogens aggravating.  I have used a number of different brands most commonly Xentec. Over the years I have grown to trust Xentec components but in hindsight realize I have had to endure on different occasions uneven colored bulbs, failed ballasts (even though I use dielectric grease), and poorly measured color profiles. I even failed a Texas vehicle inspection because of the unevenly colored bulbs. This time around I decided to try spending more on a more premium kit. Various forums and reviews show Kensun to be a quality brand, not just for the performance of their kits, but also for their excellent customer service.  The customer service reviews is what tipped the scale for me.  The fancy case was a great bonus that I'll admit I totally fell for.<br /><br />I ordered the 9007 35W 4300k kit for my Xterra. It arrived within 2 business days in true Prime fashion. I installed the kit the following weekend. After installing which took about 30 minutes, the driver side bulb did not ignite.  I switched the bulbs and then the passenger side would not ignite.<br /><br />So I emailed Kensun and let them know one of the bulbs was defective.  Within hours Kensun replied with an apology and said a new bulb would be on its way. A new bulb arrived by USPS First Class mail in a manila bubble envelope. The envelope was open on one end, the foam protective cover was missing, the edge of the mounting ring was cracked, and the bulb was marked 4000k.  Nevertheless, in need of a working lamp, I installed the bulb hoping the temperature was a misprint or would be close enough to the working lamp that I had.  Sure enough, the bulb worked great, but it was indeed noticeably warmer than the first working bulb.<br /><br />So I emailed Kensun again and let them know I was sent the wrong color temperature bulband that the two bulbs were mismatched.  I would have been okay with it, but since I was paying more for this kit than I usually do and specifically for the customer service experience, I decided I wanted to have both bulbs match.  Kensun emailed me a few days later and let me know that another replacement bulb was on its way, AND that I should keep the first replacement bulb as a spare [these guys are awesome]. That bulb arrived a few days later in the same manner as the first but in better condition.  This new bulb was also marked 4000k.  I removed the first working bulb I had marked 4300k and replaced it with the new one so both bulbs were rated at 4000k.  This time, both bulbs fired up, they have the same color profile, and there are no problems.  In fact, after having had the brown and blue eyed dog for a week, I liked the 4000k color profile better anyway.<br /><br />Even though I took the longer road to getting the results I wanted, I'm pleased with the responsive customer service and the great looking lights. These lamps do seem to warm up faster than the Xentec lamps as well and the color is clean and consistent.  There is no shaking and there is quick activation of the high beam magnets. The high beam rise does not spill out evenly but there is excellent visibility in the corners. Plus that's why I have LED light bars.  Well-played on the fancy case. Mine has been gutted and now holds some of my electrical tools.
B0002JMIEK|5|Best car polish ever, not a wax ,my car is like a mirror now
B001EMRQBE|5|Great fit - almost a year now and no sign of coming loose.
B000F23F0A|5|good product. Delivered as stated.
B00ESLBS1W|3|Ok case for the older design Mercedes keys. I do own a better case that has been worn out through several years of use and was looking to replace.
B00GQ0A1NY|4|Worked ok but not as high quality as expected for price paid.
B0009IQXJ0|5|Makes my tires shiny for at least a few days.  I love how it makes them look.
B00UMHCCSY|5|The are very nice, easy to install and bitght as sheet
B00MJ488JA|5|Great product. Easy install. Satisfied my needs.
B0091W52MY|5|please never stop selling these, my cat goes crazy for them!
B000C7YLEW|5|Shipping was fast and on time!  Easy install, part worked well.
B00DTDDVOM|5|Did just what I was looking for at a very affordable price. Very easy to instal. I stopped half way through to have lunch but total on-hands time was probably less then 2 hours. The lift got me just a hair under the much needed extra 2 inches of extra clearance my RZR needed.
B003PIQ2SS|4|Install requires that you take off the rear bumper and lower the exhaust. Also, you may have to hone out the holes in the frame for the bolts to fit. Does not come with wiring kit.<br />The instructions are useful if you are half ways mechanically inclined. Looks decent and stays out of the way. Easily accessible.
B00KWMG4A6|4|Everything I expected!
B01092I9LA|5|We love the covers for the price a great deal, custom fit ones cost 400.00 dollars more and do the same job.
B000ALG86E|2|Covered my car for a week, mainly to protect it from sun and bird poop. To that extent it performed well, but as I removed the cover expecting a clean vehicle I was surprised to see a thick layer of yellow dust coating the whole car. So, this bargain cover is great at neutralizing the threat of  airborne avian projectiles but porous enough to let seep through (and seemingly attract) every speck of pollen in a five mile radius.
B00BRL6S9I|4|The product appears to be good; I have yet to use it. I'll update my review as soon as I use it. My only complaint is that the bottle with the oil leaks.
B004ZF391S|5|Love 'em
B0045IBCGE|5|Great lens. But need new bulbs to be brighter and whiter. I used philips xtreme vision 130
B00RWGKGGS|5|Perfect fit, very nice
B00FDW4AWO|5|Ez to install, i put one in my 2015 polaris 570 midsize with no problems. Awesome product, way better then polaris attempt at a heater, you have to butcher your machine using polaris heater system. Thing throws mad heat, noce also to use when warmer out for air circulation
B007N6YWQM|1|Purchased the front hood lift supports August 16, 2015 and installed them when received. Here it is September 16, 2017, just two years later and the lift support on the right side has broken away from the fire wall nub. Apparently the plastic used for the hinge is poor quality and I wouldn't purchase these again.
B004HYPO38|5|They fit perfectly and was easy to install!!!
B000HZUXNW|5|Great alternative to having your child's things all over the floor of the van!
B0024NO97Q|5|Recently installed these lights....they fit perfectly (for aftermarket lights) and the beams are fully adjustable.  Very satisfied.
B000FN8H52|5|Works great on precise sanding spots.
B000HE6ULC|5|fit in same place as leaker.. works great.
B003W04A7O|4|I have cruise control on my bike, so this is just a secondary thing for slower in traffic riding. It keeps my wrist from cramping up so it gets a definite like.
B00QT7ZZBC|3|Just okay quality.
B00430CBSW|5|works great for small spaces, inside lettering on trunk, etc.  Also use to dust dashboard crevices and little holes in ventilated seats.
B004ATQBJ6|5|Love them
B00SOWKL6Y|3|Not quite what i expected it to be. i thought it might be raised a bit since its stated to be a decal not a sticker... in reality its just a boring flat sticker. Pretty script but i definitely won't be putting it on my Mustang.
B000C5403G|4|Better than the factory one,  don't know if it's good enough though.  I may have to upgrade to an aftermarket heavy duty adjustable one.  I really shouldn't penalize this one,  though,  it is better made than the stock one.
B002UD0GGS|1|Tried this on a plastic screen protector and cintiq screen.  It didn't do anything.  Just about everything I've tried using this on has done absolutely nothing for removing scratches.  Terrible product.  Also on the back- Warning: Buffer application may create airborne crystalline silica, an inhalation carcinogen.
B00CA63DHE|5|the best !
B00SA5I1FS|5|Ordered this for husband.  He put it on his 2015 Chevrolet Equinox.  Very satisfied.
B000CL3DN8|3|Fits Toyota pickup (87) flasher socket perfectly, but does NOT work at all with all LED bulbs. At least the original factory flasher would hyper-flash. This one does nothing.
B00ZVJ2T40|3|they were real hard to put on and didnt fit my back seats but their customer service was good!
B00LNQBQLW|1|Does not fit a 2015 f150 super crew. Plugs in but does not fit into housing.
B005CHFD62|5|Like that the product is much like the decals you receive when renewing your vehicle plates.
B003YJJHI0|3|Slight increase in water flow. Better than the standard but not as good as advertised.
B00EYK50UC|5|So originally I bought other LEDs which did not have this protective clear coating on the LEDs that the iJDMTOY ones do and about 2 hours after<br />I installed them they burnt out. These can handle extreme heat and are perfect since I mounted them very close to my light bulb near the projector. They are super bright and actually project onto the wall lol overall I would highly recommend these.
B000C9VWQU|5|Comes with about 12&#34; of wire from the plug.
B003RWQATI|5|Very happy with this purchase, second time I buy someting from this company, and everyting works realy good.
B001O7PNS2|5|Perfect for a diy quick waxing job, can't go wrong here
B000IOQ7XM|5|Great price, great fit, hopefully holds up better than the factory magnesium cover.<br />Gasket included!
B00TXQUA8O|1|shame on me for not noticing it contains an error: noun and verb do not match, should be LOOKS.
B000COCTWG|5|I installed these on my 01 TJ. Big improvement over the old stock/OEM bulbs. Worth the extra cost.
B004LF6KJU|5|worked just as advertised
B000EA5WLS|4|My crack was old and so it's still visible after the repair, but beats replacing the entire windshield. And come Inspection time I no longer have to worry about that red sticker marked FAILED.
B001DRP9E6|5|Fits well, identical to OEM for much less cost. Thank you MANN for offering quality parts to North America for those of us who that drive rare euros.
B00NF1SK1M|5|The kit comes with instructions and was very easy to install. Just be sure to be careful when cutting out the original piece of plastic as the knife can slip out of the groove and get a cut. Anyway it amazes me that they didn't put these filters in from the factory.
B0068FWM70|4|Slick
B000P17NXQ|5|Easy to install.  Easy to setup.  Makes adjustments to fining tuning e--brakes on the trailer as simple as possible.  The real time read of the voltage and the multiple color options for the screen are nice touches.  Greta, compact size, fits perfectly on the lower dash with a couple screws.  The added bracket options in the box make putting this anywhere convenient.
B001T9CG9E|3|Seems to work as advertised.
B00BWAGWYK|5|Arrived quickly. Frame is solid and rhinestones are secure. Love that the screw covers are a little anti-theft to keep from easily stealing the license plate.
B00S0GDRMY|5|Looks great, great transaction
B004L9RPN6|5|Stands up to what I expected. Use it on a 200hp Johnson and the changes are:<br />1-out of the hole in a short jump,  with lower rpm.<br />2-no more porpoising and no more need to place people on the bow to get a better ride.<br />3-chine walk that apeared at top speed is now gone.<br />4-can cruise now at lower speed with down to 2800rpm, and that means a pleasure ride with lower noise and a clear drop of fuel consumption.
B00ZGUMW8W|5|came in 4 days as described. fit was spot on and all pins and clips were with it...totally satisfied
B007M5QGHW|3|It did the job but I had to buy an additional piece that was shown in the picture but not included.
B000667QL4|3|as described. a little slow to heat.. Thanks!
B00B5KYS9I|5|Looks great and was easy to install, however the staples don't completely go through the plastic (not the staples fault really), so what I did was got them through as far as I could (about half way) and then just duct taped the edges to the plastic.  My other issue was my console lid was cracked and broken in many spots which I had to rig back together.  The over all out come looks great though.  Much cheaper option to revitalizing your center console lid.  Highly recommend
B00JLPNHJQ|5|supper product
B00KL3ALGO|1|Doen't blok the sun. It falls regularly and it doesn't look good (lots of wrinkles no matter how much you try)
B000BGHYDO|5|Works great
B001LHVOVK|1|I have tried to use this on both a 2008 Honda Fit and a 2007 Acura TL-S.  It will not work with either car.  Be sure you confirm that it will work with your car before you purchase.  The claim that it works with &#34;1996 and new cars with OBDII&#34; is misleading.
B0088CNNGK|2|These are too long for my wheels. I need to find some half as long.
B000HDGH1G|5|Easy to use and not too heavy.  the quick release is nice too.
B00OHY0XXO|5|I just received my steering wheel cover and it fits just as expected. The color is great and it seems to made of very quality materials. I bought this cover because my old one fell apart after a short period of time and based on the quality this one should hold up better.
B003SJ2B8O|4|I received this during a rare cloudy/rainy period of our Iowa summer, so yet to test effectiveness.  Definitely pleased with my other Goal Zero purchases, and happy with durability of this item.  Just ordered another one to maximize wattage for my Yeti 150.
B009DK2PL0|5|Very happy with the quality and fast shipping.
B000CCDN14|4|This is a very good system and priced well, the only downside is Stainless is very difficult to clamp. I had to have a local shop mig weld it for $100. It still ended up costing $250 less then if I had purchased everything locally. Quiet system from inside the cab, but deep tones outside.
B00L84EKI0|5|Awesome product
B00C070M9K|3|I purchased this Vission 13.3&#34; flip down DVD player to replace one of this same brand that quit working in a used car we purchased. I wanted to be able to just unplug the old one and put in this new one without any modifications to the wiring or my vehicle. The directions that come with it are minimal and not intended for the DIY installation. We were able to install it easily enough because it was the same brand. I bought the same size (according to the owner's manual that was left in the glove box) but this player is a few inches bigger so it covers most of the view out the back window of my Chevy Traverse. My kids love the bigger screen but in heavy traffic situations it isn't safe to have it down.<br /><br />The player itself works great. This player is easier for my kids to insert and remove the disks. The last player had very little room between the roof of the car and the disk, making it difficult to get the disk lined up to be pulled in. The infrared headphones we have (two different brands) work just fine with it. The kids can hear their movie and I can listen to the radio or have a conversation with my passenger. The FM transmitter is not great. The sound has to be turned all the way up on the radio in order to hear the movie and then it still isn't loud enough if there are quiet conversations in the movie. When we are driving close to large cities, with a radio station on nearly every frequency, the sound breaks up. Also, when I turn off the car while they are watching a movie using the FM transmitter, the radio blares very loud static. I had a factory installed DVD player in my last vehicle so I'm having a hard time getting used to this player turning off with the key but the sound still being on through the radio.<br /><br />This player comes with a remote but I can't give a review on that as our last player's remote was missing so we got used to navigating with the buttons on the player and we continue to do so with this one.
B003IS3HV0|4|great
B003EOZLEO|1|I wish I had something nice to say here. These look like they would be a great product if they were manufactured properly. Both side steps were impossible to install without rubbing or scraping on the body mount cups. Even when I did get them in place, they squeaked constantly due to rubbing on the body mounts. I really wish I could have liked these more. I do like the look better than most other options. I was forced to return them when I couldn't get them installed without rubbing and squeaking.
B000C9RTG2|5|Fit perfectly on 2003 Camry.
B00E7BADXM|5|I LOVE this shirt. I am a huge Porsche fan and this was a must have since I eat slee breathe racing. The fit is spot on and it feels to be quality made. Worth every penny.
B006N98Q1M|5|Fit well on 2003 Camry.
B0040M8D1W|5|Does what it says
B00355IZM2|5|Worked very well. Never had a problem again. I have to say that since the cost includes the materials for only one side,  I consider it overpriced. 'Corvette tax' or not,  it's still a Chevy.
B00I87BM5E|4|perfect OEM item but over priced compared to aftermarket.
B00D3E1E5A|5|Fits in the filter holder of my '04 Highlander much better than the Purolator.
B00ZY2AE6E|5|Love these things. They come on and off with ease but are still secure. Not sure how they do it.  The gel is super comfortable and stays mostly cool even in the summer. The black color goes well with my car's interior. I also bought the wider one for a coworker who was having wrist pain with her computer. She said that they've really helped her.
B009Y7MJVS|5|Ordered this product when I got another car and removed my EZ pass with the Velcro tabs. I was wondering if I should get more sticky tabs from my local EZ pass center or look for something else that does not stick to the windshield? I found this product after doing my research. The EZ pass (I have the older, bigger one) snapped right in. I tried the suction cup on my kitchen counter first and it stuck really good. I went out and placed it behind my mirror so I don't even see it when I am driving. I saw the arrows on the EZ pass pointing out, however, I did not want to see the EZ pass at all so I turned it around and it works like a charm. So, no matter which way the EZ pass is pointing it will still work. I leave mine in the car and so far it has stuck on the windshield without movement. I know if I ever want to take it off, just pull the small tab and voila it will be off in a jiffy. I recommend this as an excellent product and the bonus is very little cost.<br />P.S. Lifetime guarantee. You cannot beat that.
B00HS4IKIA|4|Nice cover except the fabric used is thin (although very waterproof)  and will most likely be in the trash within a year. It was cheap and I suppose you get what you pay for!
B00HEDKWPY|5|679012 is the same y as 679011 except it has heat shield attached.Installed the y pipe today on a 2004 super duty 6.0 removed turbo to install.Easy job except for removing the exhaust manifold bolts needed heat to remove .pipe is made in China ,look and fit is good.Looks like OEM .This was the cheapest option $209 shipped.we'll see how long it lasts !
B00U8ETLJ4|5|Rules
B004R35CUE|4|These roof racks are great for how cheap they are (compared to the $500 Thule's I was looking at). I have a 2012 MazdaSPEED3 and these fit perfectly! The design of these aren't thrilling-the setup was kind of weird with the base that looks like suction cups. But I love how low-profile and not bulky these are! I bought these to haul my kayak around and one thing to keep in mind is that these have a hauling capacity of 110 lbs!<br /><br />My one real complaint was the packaging of this product. Mine came with a huge chunk of the rack scraped down to the metal. Other than having to paint these immediately so they don't rust I don't have any complaints. Yeah, there's more wind noise from them but that's to be expected. These met my expectations for $200 roof racks, but if you expect to use them all the time I might spend a little more and make sure that you buy durable ones so you only have to buy one set.
B0035YYZXQ|5|Great item for the wall.
B00E3VVLTQ|1|Not very thick material.It arrived all bent up so I sent it back. Packing sucked !
B008FY27QI|4|Recently moved to Las Vegas and knew that it would be super hot in the car if left parked or even while driving. This Dash Designs dash cover definitely keeps car temps cooler and protects dash from the harsh sunlight. Highly recommend this product. It fits pretty flush but I would like the kit to include more velcro as 2 strips that were included arent enough. Otherwise an excellent product by far
B0061N0IHU|5|Good quality, just as described. Very good value for the price
B001P3VJR4|5|Worked good on 07 prowler
B000E63LCE|5|Delivered as promised
B00032KC2G|5|This was exactly as advertised.  The quality was good.  Fit was perfect.  Would recommend.
B004Q4XWLU|3|Be prepared to get frustrated with the install and spend half a day doing it. For something as simple as a skid plate that's ridiculously more time than it should take.  No doubt the plate itself is seriously heavy duty. But anytime you start seeing things like a template for drilling holes, special adapters to get bolts into possible places, you know they didn't take their time planning this thing out.  And plan on making a couple trips to the hardware store. I called tech support to complain and they said they were &#34;aware&#34; that different bolts were needed. As if it's really hard to go pull one off the shelf and make sure the bolts provided actually fit the adapters that you supply!!!!  In short? Well made unit, but you better have the equipment and tools and be VERY creative and have plenty of mechanical ability to pull this project off. And I do call it a project, not an install. It's far from being bolt on.
B0087NAZM0|5|The only way to have a pleasant ride with your partner! Great reception, easy, easy setup!
B000CIPBFE|5|Excellent product and seller.
B001KQCC9K|3|BEWARE of fitment: This part DOES NOT FIT the 2002 BMW 330Ci.  Amazon's site said it does.  After removing the regulator on our car and comparing it with this model, it is clear that it is not a correct fit.  If I had to guess, this one fit's a BMW e46 4-door sedan.  The doors on our car (330Ci, two door coupe) are larger.<br /><br />I will say the part quality looks very good-- the cabling system appears to be an improvement over the OEM regulator.
B002E581AK|5|Just like the original. Plug and play.
B008BC8G7S|3|The right side angle is off, but other than that they are good.
B00BTGSID0|5|I was as skeptical as anybody else when purchasing these towels. I've bought plenty of microfiber towels in the past from walmart/target etc - but these definitely are a bit better and have a higher quality feel to them.  I have put them through the washer/dryer and used them to dry a car and they still perform excellently. Its very easy to tell what side is the drying side and what side you can use to scrub something down - and to my amasement - they felt just as new after going through a couple washer/dryer cycles. I do appreciate the quality of these towels and will be buying more from the Chemical Guys.
B00DQ9YT6I|5|Fast delivery, quality work
B00MVQPQ0U|5|I like it
B0038YNA16|3|used the buffer with compound and it did no seem to have enough power to buff the compound. Had to manually rub the compound in with a cloth
B00X04M6V4|5|I didn't expect it to be rubber but I like the way it looks. Just put in on today so we'll see how it holds. I used 2 part epoxy as recomended along with the 3M tape on the back. I didn't give 5 stars and almost gave it a 3 star rating because it is extremely difficult to install with trying to keep the epoxy in control and not drip it all over the window or roof. 2 part epoxy sets in about 5 minutes so you have to warm up the spoiler before mixing epoxy, hurry and apply epoxy and install spoiler before it cools down too much and before your expoy sets or else you're SOL! As you know the top of the window on a dodge challenger is pretty high and hard to reach the center standing 5'8&#34; tall. Really does look nice after all is said and done, gives that extra flair no other Challenger has..............update 3 weeks on and still holding srtong even in the 100 degree weather. Really love the way it looks, changing my 4 star to a 5
B00O7Q1XFY|2|The pictures provided are confusing and suggested that the curtains could be used for the front windows as well as the back. Turns out the provided curtain rails are only suited for the back side windows of my 2004 Toyota Rav4. Wish more information on the product was provided. I dove in and purchased these thinking they would work well for me, but I was wrong.
B006N9392I|1|wrong ones
B001RBCU90|3|I really like this, the only issue I had was when putting it on my car window I had issues with it completely sticking on so I had to use some glue on a portion of the paw.
B0055FFMGM|5|I love the variety.  Haven't had a cool enough day yet to use them yet.  Can't wait.
B0046IC24O|3|the programming procedures did not work with this vechicle
B003IS3HV0|4|Easy to use.
B00MB0D9G4|5|Good
B00ONGZTQ2|2|Only worked on high speed
B000JIND4S|5|Bought this after my car was stolen. It's easy to put on and take off and feels very sturdy. No safety device, on it's own, will prevent theft, but this, layered with other devices, like an &#34;across the steering wheel&#34; Club, gives me a little more peace of mind. At least thieves will have to work a bit harder if they have to break through 1, 2, 3 or more devices, and hopefully the extra time will mean someone will have more of a chance of noticing what they're up to and scare them off.
B004ZF3FJO|5|Great Product I have theses on my 2006 Nissan Frontier and they are super bright!! Way brighter then my stock headlight I had! Well worth the money
B007SKAKPU|5|works well
B003DNJ728|5|It's perfect fit for my Volkswagen EOS.. love it...
B00266Z8LW|5|yes good
B00U1PH5H0|5|I love it
B00ADS667K|5|As advertised  a good product . But they should have directions sent with the items.
B000BYD7B4|5|No problems, and after tune-up gas mileage went up.
B005IUY9JK|5|Rotella 5-40 going to run in Explorer& scooter
B00GSAUHB8|4|No complaints. Got to me on time.
B000O1E5UQ|1|I purchesed the pump about a year and a half ago.... I used it 5 times, then i moved and couldnt get to it for a whole year.. I recently moved and had the pump mailed. It cost 50 bucks and when it arrived to only would pull to -10. I did some research and turns out I most likely blew a vane in the pump. Theres only 5 authorized places in the US where you can take it.. Just so happens one is in the next city over... So I call robinair.  ROBINAIR WILL NOT FIX YOUR 3CFM STAGE 2 VACUUM PUMP..  SO MANY OF THEM BREAK THEY CANT KEEP UP. AND WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AFTER THAT 1 YEAR WARRENTY IS OVER...  SO WISE UP AND BUY A USED BETTER BRAND..<br /> THE GUY PRETTY MUCH SAID SORRY/TOUGH LUCK.. if you dont believe me call...  ITS A SHAME BECAUSE I KNOW OF A LOT A 710ers THAT BOUGHT A 3 CFM STAGE 2 AND NOW THEIR UP S*** CREEK..  TALK ABOUT A BUMMER
B009HL6P3O|4|So far so good. Just curious how long it will last
B000ALBZA8|5|Great match for my ice silver 2013 camaro!!!! Fast delivery !!!
B001C6N6F2|5|arrived on time and is better than oem was thank you
B008G21YE0|5|These are some great headlights! They are definitely worth the money. They replaced my old fogged out lights in my 2008 Silverado. Wasn't difficult to install. I just watched a video on YouTube and followed it and they fit perfect.
B000Q86IQQ|5|A+
B0007Z1A0M|5|perfect
B001GRTHQ4|5|Great product, quick delivery!
B007KALCSM|5|Came quickly and is really cute....however screws that came with it do not fit and it has 4 screw holes and only came with 2 screws. I used my screws from my previous holder so it worked out
B000E2CVDI|5|It was packaged well, fit, does not leak what more to say besides the ability to use a ratchet or wrench to take it out should make life easier when it becomes time to change it out.
B00XYOCY5S|5|fit great
B00PNKHW4E|2|First off, If I had known that it was coming from China, I would not have bought it. Second, It is not a 360 degree bulb. So it only lights half of the headlight. Third, It is not as bright as the halogen light bulb. I would NOT recommend this as a main headlight for any vehicle. It would be just fine as a fog light or DRL. I would not waste the money to buy as a headlight.
B005CHFD62|5|Great Deal!
B000QGZXCS|5|Best. Product. Ever!
B0009IQXJK|5|excelente
B000OZXLQ6|5|great storage...keep everything from bouncing around on the side by side while riding and it keeps the items safe.
B00P80905I|4|Seems to be very good quality.  It is slightly smaller than the OEM filter it replaces, perhaps 3/32&#34; less in width.  Height and thickness seem to be the same.  I shimmed it with some paper so it wouldn't slide around.
B00NERV3M0|2|It does not mount up to the Yamaha Rhino 450 radiator. There are adapters that are used to make it universal, however it does not work in any configuration. I could not wait another 8 days for a new one so I made it work by only securing it to the radiator with to bolts after drilling a new hole in the radiator mounting assembly. It works but is is not what was advertised.
B00EKTIVGW|5|No complaints perfect
B00FWPFKGM|5|Just as described, actually received two gaskets in package.
B00U36UON4|5|I bought this for my husband, who just got back into motorcycle riding. He  LOVES it! Has not worn it riding yet but he loves the quality, style and fit.  He is 180, 5' 11&#34; and typically wears an XL in a shirt or jacket but I bought the large from the reviews I read on how a motorcycle jacket is supposed to fit. It is PERFECT, an XL would have been way to large. It's a keeper!
B000WJAH5M|5|After using these covers I can't ride without them. They dampen the vibrations and are much more comfortable than the hard grips.
B000C91FRQ|5|fit perfect
B00CL2J0DS|5|awesome
B00144DDOQ|5|as described. Thanks!
B001KSA9SE|5|awesome
B004PFYCM8|5|This magnet is just what I needed to hold the bottom of a gate closed. It holds securely but is still easy to open.
B005FNKSMW|2|does not hold charge
B001DKT0DO|5|Nice product!
B00GWEU166|5|this work great and give a sophisticated glow in the cabin.  Not too bright and not too dim but just right.  Because of their size, my fat fingers had a time getting them into the socket but of course that has nothing to do with the lamps.
B000E35UV2|2|cheap. worked ok for month, lower hose nipple broke and leaked all over
B001G7IHPG|5|Fit great.  Was a bit tricky to get the old switches out of the Bezel.  I ended up taking a small screwdriver and opening up the old bezel from the center first, then the outside of the switch and it popped right out.  Fits great.
B00UG2QYSY|5|Does what it is designed for.
B00APVPEI2|4|Works fine, but a bit pricey
B000C75LLE|5|good product
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Really great for the price.
B00I09IZW8|5|Took out the drone in my Jetta, still loud when i step on it, but cool and quiet when i'm cruising, I would recommend.
B000M5ZWBA|4|Wonderful and amazing. Very big size disadvantage.
B005YP38EQ|3|Fits tight in the 1999 Chevy Tahoe LT
B0023WIUCS|5|Every f150 these year models should be equipped with these fog lights they are very nice it changes the look of ur truck they fit perfect no problems even comes with bulb
B003ZWKH3U|4|Works great.  Fits well.  Made sturdy.
B00PQZPMYI|5|Actually quite nice material, not scratchy. There is a seat cover installation video that made for easy installation.
B004SL8568|5|Was genuine Toyota coolant as advertised.
B000P6UNL0|4|Purchased this recently as a replacement tip for a grease gun I've had for many years that had developed a leak.  Screwed right on, with no leaks after several uses.  Not an extremely high-end product, but you get what you pay for.
B00JHEG7UW|1|Color was not even close to what it was supposed to be. I ordered purple 9006 and H11, but the 9006 bulbs were dark, dark blue, and the H11 bulbs were bright pink. I have ordered purple headlights before from other manufacturers, and the color was perfect. When i seen the color output these bulbs gave i was very disappointed.
B00AUKRZLW|5|Great material. Will last a long time!
B00VBPKII2|5|Works good, take your time. Patience
B00SJXE9R0|5|Very Good.
B003X3PQN2|3|Used as instructed and the tank sensor did show 2/3 full instead of full but didn't  quite work as well as I had hoped.
B0062EI33O|5|Just as expected. Fit great and works very well. No need to spend triple the price for name brand

B009K4H42Y|5|exact fit, good price and quick ship
B001GJ3G0A|4|Bought all 3 Viking's microfiber drying towel, wax removal cloth and wax applicator. Drying towel is of decent size and works well. Use wax removal cloths for polishing exterior and interior of car. Size is small yet did the job. The small blue wax applicator sponge absorbed liquid such as tire shine but later use to apply the same for exterior plastics fittings. For all 3, it served the purpose with a good price. Viking's wash bucket is on the way.
B006T8IWGQ|3|This was my first time installing a wall decal.  The process was tedious and frustrating, but I am happy with the final outcome.  The quality of this particular decal was not great.  The letters were not coming off easily.
B00NPMRNZU|5|FIT PERFECTLY AND OME!
B00FZRYQPS|3|whew pricey  but works

B0002SQUTU|5|Just what the Doctor ordered
B00P1HQKVK|4|Love the doors only thing they had no instructions...
B00U02PQR0|4|So...part good, part not as great. So I waited to Do my review until after I had a chance to get back from vacation where I used both new discs. I live in Arizona and loaded the western disc about a week before we left for New Orleans. There were no issues what so ever. The western disc worked perfectly. On our drive the disc continued to be perfect. Once we got to say Baton Rouge the western disc ran out and I needed to load the eastern disc. There were problems right away. It wouldn't load and work and gave me an error message. I ejected and loaded it several times and it started working. While in New Orleans it continued to give me trouble off and on but mostly worked. Since I live in the west and go east in my car very rarely I will only use the western disc 99% of the time and it works fine.
B000IG3QUM|3|it is too small to see the number.
B005C58JZQ|5|Excellent
B00EOTE8BA|5|Fit my old motorhome perfectly.
B00JXNJT8E|2|It ended up being way too shiny for my liking. In the pic it looked like more of a dull metal finish. No go on this one.
B000C7ZRT0|5|Good item, great price.
B00FPKZY60|5|Looks and fits wonderful. Recommended
B00FS77ISW|4|Product works great. Super easy to use an durable.
B000EQFK5K|1|Save your money and buy OEM!<br /><br />I've had this for all of 3.5 months and its already giving me problems. About half the time the left indicator blinks fast like a bulb is out but is not. Went through and replaced every flashing bulb in the car and I still randomly get this problem. I know its the switch because I can flip it back up and down again a few times and it starts to flash normally and all bulbs now blink after doing so.
B001V6MGZO|5|Just what I wanted
B004GDUUH0|1|Not quite oe. Mounting tabs were smaller and pretty much completely  broken off when received. Should have paid for the real thing.
B002UC4TEO|5|Strap on good
B000KL8QUK|3|OK item, but didn't look good on the 4 runner because of the roof rack position.
B008S2XJF0|5|Excellent quality frames, OEM from BMW. Couldn't ask for more.
B000AMBNPY|5|We have a Subaru Forrester and I hate the sun burning me. The have shields for them in the back and I can stick a blanket in the window but then my hubby can't see. This is the best for both is us. It shields me and he can see perfectly. When it's HOT (high 80+) you still feel the heat but it still helps!
B00DI4TA2Y|5|excellent helmet
B000HI0UK0|4|Good product for the price, quality is well made and did what I needed it to do.
B00AY1K41U|2|Doesnt actually clip the sun visor it just rests in it
B002FXQ3FQ|5|Went on very easy.  Looks great
B00XF6R464|3|I had to make a minor modification to allow the clip to catch on the OEM side of the plug. Other than that it was an easy install and they worked as they were expected to.
B007DPI0AM|5|not what I thought it was have a 2500HD this bumper is not made for it but made it work<br />if you have a 1500 or 2500 would be better than great
B008G1Z47Y|3|Coming straight out of the box, they were great.  However, during installation, the driver taillight had a bad circuit board and did not work.  I was too short on time to send it back so luckily I was able to use the circuit board from the old taillight but I still had to transfer the rubber gasket from the new circuit board to the old for the tighter fit.
B00L4TF32G|5|This product works great, and it is simple to use. Everyone marvels at my tires.
B00B5WB9AM|5|Added that little bit I was missing from the bike (bought it used with parts missing) 08 gsxr 600. Took a bit of the vibration out of the handlebars as well.
B003U95R6K|5|Sounds amazing. Good bark to it around town. When over drive kicks in the exhaust is almost silent. Took a 5 hour road trip. No drone, radio on level 2 at 70 mph. Only heard it to pass vehicles. Excellent kit.<br /><br />Only con is they instructions. It looks like in the diagram you still need to use the mid pipe when for the crew cab short bed you do not. Very quickly figured out when putting it together. Fit and finish amazing
B00EEDWRYG|5|Excellent. Closest to authentic, other than making a trip to SE.
B001TAJXXA|5|Can finally see through my headlights again!
B00DSGHP7O|5|Great oil. Only stuff I'll use as long as the price is right.
B005N6XC8S|4|Pretty true to size,very thin with longer arms but overall pretty cool

B007K22FVS|5|Love the new look. Fits perfect, installs in just minutes-plug and play.
B009GLWZ2K|5|Very heavy duty. Great mount. We use this on a commercial truck towing boats around the country. Fit our 2006 F350 perfectly
B000MNN4WQ|5|Purchased for husband to hold down awnings with the ability to tighten easily.  Bright orange so it can be seen easily.  Works great.  Quality Strap
B000VU7NL8|5|Bought this for my new 2015 Silverado 1500 with the short bed.  Works great, very well built and sturdy bed mat.  Keeps all my precious cargo (golf clubs) from sliding around when I romp on the gas and let that 6.2 Liter breathe!
B0042B9REI|5|It fits like it was built for my truck. A real value and worth every penny. Came a bit earlier than expected which is always welcome. Packaging was perfect. Honestly, it keeps my truck about 40deg cooler.
B000C7YQ3I|5|Go for it.
B00GNBHO4U|4|I have to admit I was worried at first because right after I put the brakes on the car pedal was mush and she didn't want to stop. I made sure the lines were bled and ran through the &#34;break-in&#34; procedure. Now I have confident stops. Still not sure how they will hold up long term but we'll see.
B00DQJB7EK|5|Installed in just a few minutes. Made my truck look alot nicer. Very happy!
B0077CSNGW|5|Love it
B000C16XLC|5|Fit  perfectly

B00WVG88EQ|4|Works great and it was a prefect fit
B000WK6P52|5|Pipes were exactly as advertised.  Great service too.  Thank you.
B00LST3022|5|so far so good.  i dont normally write reviews often on here but i do depend on them greatly so with this i thought id put in my two cents.  in reading others reviews ive seen a few guys having trouble with it not always engaging the lock mechanism.  with this in mind during my install i played with the locking mech. and found it to be kinda stiff.  so before the install i lubed everything up with a coat of white lithium grease and worked it in.  so far i havent missed one lock or unlock.  another not i followed the instructions but found on my 08 double cab i dont have white with silver strip or blue with silver strip just plain white and blue.  instructions say go blue from the lock to blue in the truck and green from the lock to white in the truck.  now maybe its because i was working at night and possibly i got them mixed up but i dont think so im pretty sure i connected according to the instructions but the lock was working in reverse.  the simple fix was just to swap the two butt connectors on the lock itself and everything is working good.  keep in mind i just completed the install and havent fully tested but have locked and unlocked maybe 15-20 times each and like i said with the grease in there i havent missed one operation yet.
B00LB47Q8S|5|5 stars!
B00062YYGS|2|The wires do not come ready to go, which was not advertised when I purchased them.  After assembly, I noticed that there were short wires, so they didn't all get ran exactly like they were supposed to, but they did connect.  I just had a hot mess under the hood of my 02 GTP.<br /><br />At first I was very pleased with these wires and looking forward to improved performance, however I did have to check them a few times for the first couple of weeks because they didn't want to stay attached to the spark plugs and would loosen and pop off.<br /><br />The wires seemed to do well for about 4 months after having been put onto the car.  Then I was experiencing serious misfires.  I was convinced that I had a bad fuel injector, and replaced them each one by one, however the problem persisted.  I gave up and took my car to a mechanic, who spent a few days going through everything after I assured him that the plugs and wires were almost brand new and couldn't be the source of the misfires.  He  called me a while later and asked if he could just try to change the wires out to see and I reluctantly agreed.  By the end of the day I had a call stating that the car was running like a champ and the wires were the problem.  The MSD wires were replaced, and new ones put in.<br />Afterword, I attempted to contact them and they basically said that there was nothing they could do.  After spending over $90 on wires, having them fit improperly, and having to replace them within a year, I was unimpressed.
B005FO1WJY|5|A life saving product and at amazing price. This kind of the mirrors should be made part of the original fitment for any vehicle.
B004SKSOJ2|5|it works just fine. Fits my MINI countryman perfectly
B00D8KBTWC|5|very well made, very strong, looks great on my 2015 santa fe
B0071HE2SQ|5|High quality product worth every penny. They took a little time to install, but not difficult by any means. Sound quality is a lot better than the blinc system in my spare helment. People can actually hear me when going 70mph. I can hear music and phone conversations clearly and controlling music, calls, intercom, etc. is easy. Wish I would've bought these a long time ago.
B0006PJJC4|5|as expected good
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Very satisfied with my item.
B00189AMZA|5|Nice seat
B0018R9CMG|1|I should have looked at the original Quitman first before I open this box. The old parts with 190,000 miles on them were far better shape then the new garbage that came From CENTRIC  ( The one star is for fast shipping )
B00KO9712W|5|Worked fine, does what it's suppose to do & shipping was very quick!
B00499J5W2|1|I bought this for my Honda Fit 2015, but it wasn't the right one.
B00NYXIEKI|5|99 civic...Gettid beautifully Did not eveen neeed load resistors p.s I Like flash But these are True Switchbacks Which means They  light up white when the parking light are on amd when u signal the white shutss off and then the amber signalss.. works flawlessly.. very bright to....im Not Gettin paid to post this I jst really love theThem

B000C8P8M0|5|Great product
B000BOK1NG|5|Fits well
B00099BJWU|5|Very easy to apply:  just follow the directions on the can and it will look great.
B005LH5S4U|5|Good
B00OLPGJZA|4|Worked great on my FZ09<br /><br />Greatly reduces vibration while cruising. I find myself more comfortable in the higher RPM range now as well..
B00TQZU0FA|1|Good enough metal and paint. Delivered damaged otherwise would rate much higher. Possibly from packaging, but more likely from stock storage. Bent in a couple places with a small crack. Hand straighten, but not perfect.  Good enough to use. Not worth the time to return.
B002U2D8JG|5|Looks great, easy install, I love it ❗️When I hit the brake it flashes about 10 times quickly before going steady on. It has full adhesive back. Be forewarned the wiring goes straight out of the back of it so whatever u mount it to will need a small hole drilled in it so the wires aren't bent and don't break. You can put this on whatever you like but I added mine as a light/brake light to my motorcycle. I put a mounting bar along the bottom of my Givi trunk plate so it was held securely. I went on a 1,400 mile trip the week after I installed the light and it worked great.
B002VDJ76C|4|Work great
B004WNXVNO|1|my mechanic say its to noisy when starting did he put it in correctly?
B000CPHXQ2|5|Very Nice
B00BYH6C1E|3|Initially would have given the product 5 stars.  It is great, fits perfect and performs exceptionally well.  After having now for a few years, it has faded and does not look as good as I would hope.  Now it is in a car, gets a lot of direct sunlight so I probably should expect some deterioration in color.  That's why I still give it a good rating, but would always like color to last more than a couple of years.  Might be a little too much to expect.
B007EES23M|5|I is for my husband are he is very proud to have it on his truck
B0042HLK8S|5|The pad and the velcro on the pad held up well during its first use. Used this with the Chemical Guys backing plate and with Collonite 845. Spread the product out well without absorbing too much into the pad. Because of the product I used it was difficult to wash out, but I think I got most of it out after a very thorough washing. I even tossed it into the washing machine with my microfiber towels and it held up just fine.
B00K5BDUSS|5|Ordered my leveling kit Sunday night and had it Friday morning. Had no issues with the kit when installing. I did not purchase an adjustable track bar. I just cut my old one and sleeved it with a piece of pipe. I've had no changes in ride comfort or control.
B00M78820I|3|It doesn't really reduce the heat inside your car. I think it only provides protection for the console area.
B00BI3QMAA|4|Installed these on my 02 Polaris Sportsman 700 twin. Time will tell how they hold up, but my abusive days are over so I'm sure they'll last. Upon initial inspection, I found metal shavings in the grease in both ball joints that I purchased. This is most likely a byproduct of milling the cup before installing the ball, but it shouldn't happen. That would've shortened their lifespan for sure. The Polaris OEM ball joints have a hole in them to accept greasing, these do not have the same hole so they should state they are &#34;non-greasable&#34;. I remedied this by simply drilling a hole in the same location that OEMs have one. Installation was a breeze... Put the ball joints in the freezer for a while, heated the strut up with a torch, and they slid right in with no force at all.
B0007M1FNM|5|Had a previous one that I made for towing with my 10 1/2 foot camper installed on my truck. Recently upgraded to a heavier boat, so I was concerned that the all hollow construction of the old one may not be strong enough . The portion of this Curt unit that inserts into the reciever is solid steel  and find it to be quite sturdy, but needed four more inches in length, so I also ordered a Curt ball mount that is longer than normal. Have towed the boat on several rough country roads with no problem. Very happy with the 2 day prime shipping and low price.
B00R26B9PU|3|Ok Godó
B008IK7TSA|5|Works great, only had to adjust the idle. The choke lever is too long though.
B000G22DDE|5|Easy to install, I did it by myself and the help of a jack. 3 bolts on each side and took me about an hour.
B00KLKNYF2|1|Part didn't fit
B00KBM8194|1|Thanks for sending me a USED engine mount! My mecanique didn't even accept installing it. Never buying again from Beck Arnley
B001E3HUAA|5|Last on lasted 13 years, car still looks new.
B00FJ5LBOA|4|We actually got this for our 4 year old for his birthday. He is obsessed with mowers, weed eaters, blowers, etc., and toy versions don't impress him. This is light and easy for him to operate. The only downside is he can't stray too far from the garage because it has to stay plugged it, but I must say our garage stays quite clean now! I was hoping to use it as a vacuum for my car (that would be super easy and convenient since it stays plugged in), but it doesn't really work too well for that purpose.
B0027V9NLC|5|All English Retreads products rock! They are made out of recycled components, awesome. Totally indestructible. And with this awesome biker aesthetic that really gets attention. Every time I go out with this bag I get compliments. Sadly the company no longer operates, so I'd file this under collectible!
B00DWYOVCE|2|A row of leds are intermittent. No heatsink for driver I can see.  Bright white. 3M adhesive tape on back.  Meh.
B00AK91ZDM|5|Purchased these for my 2013 Lincoln MKX to replace the AVS units I had purchased the year before which never fit correctly and were always hanging up.  After installing this product I kept my fingers crossed that that the windows would close flawlessly and I was relieved when all four windows closed without hanging up.
B004GDAZWU|5|perfect fit
B004I5O658|5|Light works as it should n also it arrived in good conditon n very fast. Thanks.
B001NYTEP4|5|Nicely made, lightweight ramps.  Handled my KLR650 just fine.  I bought two so I could walk up one while pushing my bike up the other.  Using the included strap to secure the ramp to the bumper of your vehicle is a must as the fingers that rest on your tailgate don't attach to anything.  The ramp could slip off if not secured with the strap.  I like these ramps because there is metal across the entire surface of the ramp, as opposed to some slightly less expensive ones I've seen that have only the rods welded between the side rails.  The metal &#34;mesh&#34; across the surface of the ramp makes it smoother to roll a tire up the ramp.  I will say that the metal surface did bend somewhat from weight of my bike rolling up and down.  However I don't think it's a big deal.
B007ZGE7MO|5|THE FIT WAS EXACT TO WHAT MY CRUZE SIZE IS,  AND THE PRICE WAS WELL WORTH IT!! PLUS DELIVERED ON POINT!!!
B001NIM8BW|5|Fit nice and comfy for my long road trips. Perfect!
B00HZCGHZ8|3|This decal is very pretty on my car window but it was really hard to apply...it stuck together and broke between the pedals. There has to be a better way to apply but came with no instructions.
B000BUU5YA|5|Purchased for use for our camper.  the cord is heavy duty and the plugs are sturdy.  Works well
B000BZL8UU|5|This was a perfect drop in replacement fuel pump on my 1997 F150 XLT Triton v8. Not easy getting the tank off but once the pump assembly was out of the tank and dry it was easy to install this pump kit. In fact the original wire on the assembly snapped right onto this pump so there was not re-writing needed. This comes with a hose and some clamps but I just reused the original hose and simply cut one clamp off to put on this new pump with one of the supply new clamps. The truck started right up with this pump and has been running fine for a week now. I will update this post if I have any problems with this pump in the future.
B00SL1O0VU|5|[[VIDEOID:49e0fe6f1167304f36075c7cf2d6ee58]] Please see the video for the specifics and thoughts on this unit. I can't be sure about 20 uses but as a power bank and flashlight it works great. Really hope I get to test the jumpstart aspect and revise this if needed sometime soon.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.
B005NS94CE|2|nice kit but made the truck ride very harsh.....took them back out and made shims out of a rubber mat.  Brought the truck back to proper ride height and a soft ride utilizing the old bushings soft rubber
B007TD1WIK|5|I bought this for myself a few years back and purchased again for my wife. We've used these to jump a few cars. Convenient size, long enough to reach from car to car even if not parked directly in front of each other, and short enough to easily wrap for storage in the trunk. They are very durable. No complaints. Great price!
B000E2AQXA|3|Pros:  It filters contaminants very good as far as I know.<br /><br />Cons:  The nut on top is pathetic!  It appears to slant inward ever so slight, which causes the wrench to slip off, which in turn strips the nut.  In other words, the nut is useless!  Also, it would help if they didn't put any kind of coating over the nut, this makes it too slippery when turning with the wrench.  It would help if the nut was a slightly harder metal as well.  If you try and tighten the filter to spec, it will definitely strip.  Good idea, bad cheap design!
B00B2HP1A4|5|Thank you for this great product at a great price. Looked at other sites and was expensive. Also great delivery time.
B000C2UCFE|5|Shipped as promised - product as advertised.
B00PCHSMW4|1|I just returned my black one to WalMart. The price was 107.00 on sale. I waa SO excited to see this product. It was nice looking and fit my 2006 Nissan Sentra bucket style driver's seat beautifully. It was a nice, snug fit and looked good in comparison to other brands. The problems I had were numerous though, and the first most important one  is how weak the fan motor is. I could barely feel the air flow through the cushion when the fan was on high and my A/C was on high too. I ran it like that for more than twenty minutes and my back and legs were sweltering worse than if the cushion was not on there in the first place. My normal seat are black cloth, and this was just sweaty and awful. The other complaints have to do with the odd instructions on the box and in the owner's manual. It says it ill take just five minutes to install, what a joke. I've worked with the product for two days trying to get it all right and make sure it wasn't the installation that caused the product not to work. I finally found that video online at the manufacturer's web site. I didn't have the nice luxury of taking the seat out of the car in order to install the seat cushion. LOL. Even then five minutes is a lie. I don't recommend this product.
B002W2R700|5|Me brother has a red one, I think from factory but the black one feels better just to say though the printing is just really a printing so long term I think the print would start to crack and peel off.  Of course if it was stitching it wouldn't look as good anyways! Toyota 4 Life ;)
B00UZU5DU2|1|It's way bigger than expected. When I put it on my car, I tried to lift it up a bit to reposition it and the letters got stuck on the car.
B008DRJA30|2|Had to return it did not fit my RZR..
B00540BMZS|4|Good
B00AR0PCFG|1|Installed the Diablo sport 91 octane tune on my 2014 challenger r/t at a dyno shop.  I wanted to see the hp and torque difference.  I lost 22 lbs of torque and 19 hp from stock.  I do not recommend this tuner, that is unless you prefer spending  $400 to lose power on your vehicle.
B004DWZOT8|5|loctite out performs other brand of thread locker
B00029WSWW|5|great product . Have used them before... mirror is an OEM Donnally Product
B001QVFD4K|5|Great polish/detailer to use and smells great too. Goes on very easily and wipes off with ease.<br />Flip
B010MEHHMM|5|Amazon states these are long bars, but they are SHORT Bars as. per Curt tech.  They measure approximately 28 3/8&#34; which is what I needed.  Good product
B000WJAH5M|4|I've had them on my Buell Ulysses for about a week, and in hindsight would have paid $20, or $30 for the end result.  I knocked off one star, as they're harder to cut to length than I expected.  Part of the improvement, was in the added thickness for me, and the foam is surprisingly more comfortable than I expected.  In fact, when I recieved the package I was really skeptical, contemplated sending them back, then installed them, and completely changed my mind.
B00CZCY5SE|5|Low amp draw with the same or more light output. No more burnt bulb covers as these don't get hot
B00XVDAADK|5|These 3 pc Custom Rubber Car Mats are high quality.!! We can't believe how heavy they are. We really like that we can cut the mats to fit our car. We have been undecided about whether to put them in our existing car or wait for our new car and decided that they are such high quality that we would put them into an SUV we are getting ready to buy. Really great price for these quality and durable car mats.!! Highly recommend. We received these car mats at a discount for an unbiased review.
B00YML13OU|5|Great for teaching kids in a big city. Arrived on time. Very useful.
B0038Z6LTI|3|The fans make less noise than I expected and less than the Spals that I had. I wanted more air flow, they said they were 1000 CFM each I don't think so. They work well, but put less air than the Spals which are rated 650 CFM each.
B005NACDRA|5|Well made, looks great, great price. What's not to like? Big enough for 2 people but not obnoxiously big. Handled windy Chicago weather well.
B0036TY5GC|5|Great product, great price!
B0002YR82M|5|great product which was received early.
B00XYXPWL2|4|So far, so good. It has stood up to burning hot temps, rain, and a few times through a car wash.
B00QHHLG58|5|looks grate thanks
B001FAO8I4|1|This thing is crap! Bent on first use and completely broke by 5th use.
B00QSLNK5M|5|Fits perfect and is 10x brighter than my original bulb.  Used it in my dome light inside my Tahoe.  Liked it so much I had to replace all the other interior lights to LEDs.  Well worth the time and money!!  Love it and get tons of compliments on them!!
B004NYFK7M|3|installation was easy and the rubber housing is a perfect size to hold the lights. I definitely wish they were brighter though. i installed them on the sides of the bumper on my truck in hopes that while reversing they would add light. they do add some light but i dont think its enough to make worth the time, money, and energy spent.<br />they are well made however. i've had them in salt water multiple times, got rear-ended, and had in sub zero temps and they're still working great
B0002MAANI|2|FYI :  bought for my Harleys ... the hooks are not big enough to go over a handlebar ...

B001PWA0IO|5|Bought two of these for a Ford F-150. Yes, I know it says you only need one, but I wanted my gate to drop slower, and I think just having one will over stress the shock mounts. Besides, it looks cool to have one on each side, and I think they will last much longer.

B000COA1LC|5|Purchased corner guards to hide a dent on passenger side. These were easy to install and all the holes line up perfectly.  They are plastic but look cool and well made. Only gripe I have is the bottom corner of the license plate area is not a clean looking area and is material is thin there.
