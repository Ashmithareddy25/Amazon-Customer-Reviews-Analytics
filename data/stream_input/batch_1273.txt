B004XN3FHA|4.0|I got this torch from Amazon the other day and have been very impressed so far with the brightness and solid build of the torch. The torch has quite a tightly focused beam so is great for long distance work where you need to spot out something in the dark. The flashing mode is very intense and will certainly get you noticed if that is what you want to achieve!  The only downside is the carry case for the torch was broken when I received it.  Overall a great torch for those looking for a high end unit. I recommend using some rechargable batteries with this torch as 8 batteries being used can quickly add up!
B003MC5N28|2.0|Just because a book has a sad ending does not make it a good book. The plotting was thin, the characterization was uneven, the characters themselves were described as smart but acted like idiots, the writing was juvenile. I had to go look and see if a teenager wrote this - no, it's an experienced writer. She's got no excuse. The book is a hack, in the original sense of the word. It takes pieces of other stories, hacks them to pieces, and reassembles them - badly.<br /><br />The first part starts out decently written - if you haven't watched TV or read any science fiction for the past 50 years you won't see what's coming, but if you have you'll smirk at the rather transparent \\"hidden\\" aspects of the society. The trouble is when these things are revealed it's supposed to be shocking, and it's not. I can only assume the award committee would never lower themselves to consume popular lowbrow media because everything in this book has been done, over and over, ad infinitum, since the 60's. Soylent Green, Star Trek, Twilight Zone, Asimov, etc - all did it first and honestly, did it far better.<br /><br />Haven't been this disappointed in a book in ages. This is what kids are expected to read in school across the country? This is supposed to make them think? Why is this particular book so popular with the adults who educate kids?<br /><br />It's getting made into a movie - and for once I can see this fact improving a book. This was *made* for the movies; what seems terribly shallow on the page might seem deep and meaningful on screen. Although I can only hope they dispense with the \\"Blue Eyes Soooo Special!\\" bit, because that bit just makes me sick.
0439023521|5.0|I am through half of the book, and I will say I love this story. I am on the edge of my seat and I am always wanting more. This is an easy read and the story is full of action, mystery and excitement. I just ordered the other two books because I know I will want to continue as soon as I finish the first. Can't wait to see how it all unfolds. I highly recommend this series.

B004UUKDNA|5.0|i love music in general, and to tell you the truth i listen to a lot of hip hop....but since the day i bought this album it has been playing in my ipod, ipad, phone, car stereo, company car 24/7.  This album has a unique mixture that is absolutely brilliant.  It has an old school, new school, garage band, indie, electro brilliance to it.  In other words its inexplainable, undescribable but definately addictive.

B001GMH8RO|2.0|What could be better than a romantic ghost story? GHOST begins as a humorous romantic fantasy about \\"Sam\\" (Patrick Swayze) and his sweetheart, Molly, played by the attractive Demi Moore. Sam is shot and killed during a robbery gone bad and finds himself unable to part mortality. Things become more interesting when Sam's best friend Carl [Tony Goldwyn] is revealed to be a swindling good-for-nothing crook who becomes a threat to Molly. To make things worse, Sam learns his good buddy was the one who arranged for the robbery in which he was killed. Although no harm was supposed to come to him, Sam had proprietary business information that was valuable to his buddy. As a newbe to the ghost community, Sam finds that he can't touch or move anything in the mortal world, nor can he communicate, except through a medium played by Whoopi Goldberg. Eventually, he finds another ghost (on a subway) who teaches him how to move and throw things. At this point the movie bogs down as Sam begins some first class haunting. Part of the paranormal world of spirits rests on subtly, which flies right out the window. Finally Sam manages to fight and beat up Carl, who has a fatal accident. The hounds of hell appear and whisk him off after he mumbles, \\"Sam?\\" and turns to see his body lying in the window. After that, Sam appears as a luminous being who says goodbye and walks into the light.<br /><br />The writers of this film would have done well to study \\"after death\\" experiences chronicled by Raymond Moody, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross and George G. Ritchie, not to mention many \\"paranormal\\" accounts, many of which suggest that spirits are under certain restrictions in how they can act. As far as I know, there are no \\"fights\\" between spirits and mortals, and the writers of GHOST could have brought this to a much better close. I would have personally liked to have seen Carl hauled away in handcuffs, as Sam kept his distance as a spirit.<br /><br />GHOST had a great beginning, but soon digressed into a maudlin series of unlikely events that ruined the movie. (Some may say the whole thing was unlikely, and that life after death was particularly unlikely, but that's for each person to say.)unlikely events that ruined the movie.

0316069353|5.0|Since I have been reading Michael Connelly books, he is probably my most favorite author.  He keeps you setting on the edge of your chair and I find it hard to put the book down even though it's time to quit.  This book \\"The Fifth Witness\\" is no different from all his others and I am still engaged in reading it but will finish soon and I will start another one which is \\"The Drop\\".  Keep on writing Michael and I will keep on reading.  Thanks, again,  Jack Green  Cleveland TN

B005I6EU7U|4.0|After receiving my new Fire and placing it it in the cover I laid it on the coffee table.  My son came over and picked it up and said \\"what old book are you reading now...\\".  When he saw it was my new Fire, he said, and I quote \\"Awww man Pop, that is dope! I thought it was an old book\\".  I decided then it was money well spent.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it didn't have a place to put my stylus.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|I've had this DVD for several months now, and it has become my \\"go to\\" disc when I am sick of the crap on TV.  Yes, the Scorps have a lot of concert DVDs out (and another one coming in February!), but this is a unique gem.  I was always one who loved that the Scorps delivered both in-your-face, blistering hard rock and gorgeous power ballads.  Many bands can \\"bring it\\" and make your ears bleed, but these guys are incredible musicians who really seem to care about their craft.  Nowhere have I seen them demonstarte it better than in this \\"acoustic\\" performance from Lisbon, Portugal.  The audio and video rival blu-ray in quality, and the band is as tight as ever.  The first notes Klaus sings are a bit uneven, as if he's unsure where he should be in his range given the mellower vibe.  But, a few seconds in, he locks into a groove, and his performance is amazing the rest of the way.  Most of the hits are here (some pretty true to form, and some with new arrangements), along with new songs written specifically for this show, and 3 covers (including Kansas' \\"Dust In the Wind\\"!!).  Believe me, they nail everything!  I also have Live at Wacken, which is awesome for a Scorps concert at full octane.  The 2 DVDs work for me as a \\"definitive\\" collection of the Scorps live in concert.  Yes, there is a fair amount of overlap on songs between the two, but they are delivered so differently that they do not seem reptitive at all. I'm sorry to see the Scorpions retiring after 30+ years, but I'm glad they have left us with these great recordings.

B000P2A3WI|4.0|The first thing I will say is that if you mind cussing in a book, do not pick this up. It has a lot of cussing in it. I don't really mind cussing in a book but at times I started to feel as if the author was trying to see how many times he could fit the word F--- in the book. Im not saying it did not fit the characters but it was overused, in my opinion.<br />This book is about four people who go to the top of a building to jump off on new years eve, meet each other and decide to come down after all. I put this book off for awhile because I thought it was going to be one of those way to sappy insperational stories and that isn't what I really wanted to read. Don't get me wrong they have there place but it was not something that I was interested in right now. I can't say what made me take another look at this book and then buy it,but I'm so glad that I did because it was anything but what I thought it would be. A lot of people say this is a really funny book and while some parts made me smile, I did not really laugh out loud at any of it.<br />The characters were really like able and I really enjoyed the different writing style for each of them. Each part of the book is from each persons viewpoint, and goes back and forth.<br />The book made me think, as I've been we're they are before and recently had a loss in my family so I know that depression. A long way down gave me other ways to look at things without being a really serious or depressing book, I really enjoyed it.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|The recent 2011 film `Limitless' is not only a fast paced, technically mesmerizing cinematic experience but surprises the audience with ever an accelerating journey into contemporary modes of power, persuasion and mind expansion. I was sucked in immediately, but lost a little interest halfway in when it appeared to be drifting away from the internal, speculative \\"hidden powers of the mind\\" theme and evolving into a mundane action/adventure film. Fortunately it readjusted one last time for an unexpected and memorable finale that left me with a smile on my face. Loved the soundtrack too!
B006A819AG|5.0|Unfortunately for me, I purchased this on itunes for 9.99.  Anyways, as expected, super solid album from the roots.  Great production, good lyrics.  What more can you ask for.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Watching films dealing with the theme of the Holocaust are somewhat a necessary evil. \\"We must never forget\\" is not just an overused slogan, it's an existential imperative. Yes, they are definitely difficult, often times traumatic emotional experiences for the viewer. So much so that one actually feels guilty afterwards admitting that they enjoyed the film. Somehow using the word \\"enjoyed\\" sounds out of place, callous, or more appropriately blasphemous. Atrocities of this magnitude must be studied, understood and endured, but enjoyed?<br /><br />So keeping in mind the above mentioned sentiments I would like to recommend the 2011 film `Sarah's Key'. Though a fictional tale, the foundation of the story deals with the true account of Frances collaboration with the Nazi's in gathering up the Parisian Jewish population in the infamous Vel d'Hiver Roundup. As one would expect from a film of this nature the events are horrific, heartbreaking and intense. And as far as happy endings go, the wise viewer should be looking more for a little personal insight and hope rather than any rainbows and unicorns.<br /><br />In my estimation the Holocaust theme alone makes `Sarah's Key' worthy of one's time and attention.  However add to that the simple fact that this is a thoughtful, well told, tale perfectly paced to keep the audience focused and fascinated from beginning to end. The acting is wonderful especially little Melusine Mayance as Sarah Starzynski and Kristen Scott Thomas as Julia Jarmond. This is a story that will stay with you. It will make you think, make you reflect, make you ask yourself what if? 'Sarah's Key' is a film to own and watch whenever your priorities are in need of a little reminder of what's really important.
1451627289|5.0|Got this book on a Thursday and finished it up by Sunday night-one of the best book's I've read this year.  First King book I've read, so can't compare it to others
B004SGWYW4|2.0|First of all, I will say the artwork and anime design in this movie are top notch, although I'd seen scenes of zombies attacking and eating humans that were better designed and drawn out in todays video games than presented here in this film. And although I've outgrown my desire for slasher films and Friday 13th type movies, I did realize what this film was about going in. I purchased it, however, hoping that there would be plenty of nudity and aberrant sex scenes thrown in to add to the mix and make up for all the other gory parts of the story.   Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. And not being so inclined, I don't feel the need to spend time watching teaser films either, hoping as I was that this film was going to be a bit more than that.  Something else I disliked about this film was the frequent number of times it went off into song. This was most disconcerting and annoying, and totally extraneous and unnecessary to the storyline. I mean, I understand music backing up the action of the story, yes, and background music. But stopping the story and going off into this interlude several times just to break out into some type of quasi-rock song only to then go back to the action of the movie...Really aggravating.  So, this is a mixed review. Personally, I didn't care for the movie, but then I have rather eclectic tastes as far as anime films go, running toward the more hard core, and either reviewers didn't expound enough in their reviews to give me a clearer picture of what I was in for once I committed myself to purchasing this film, or I missed the ones that would have guided me where I needed to go.  There is no nudity until very late in the series, only teasing up-skirt and busty clothed boob shots throughout most of the film, as we watch the youngsters run for their lives trying to escape the zombies death grip. If you're looking for nudity and sex, look elsewhere, If you like the teasing and soft-porn style this movie presents, then you will definitely like thisfilm.

B004HO6I4W|5.0|I was able to grab this movie on sale and it was well worth it! I got it for my daughter for her birthday and the entire family loved it. That includes ages 11, 16 and 20 along with mom and dad. The disc offers a number of fun and interesting extras that are worth viewing.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I just finished watching the remake of Fright Night; with my husband an hour ago. I loved it. It was just as good as the original. Some of the scenes took me by surprise.

His characters are strong and I believe I would enjoy meeting them in this part of the multiverse.  This story sees Sam, Sybil and young Sam holidaying in the countryside at the old Ramkin Estate and even Wilikins comes along for the ride.  Sam has to deal with honest country folk, goblins and whirling maids then return home in time to save Fred from a mysterious fate.

0783225547|1.0|ok, where to start.  well, it appears that hollywood's storywriters for a long time seem to have something less than merely a 3rd grade education, for in this movie, the logic and plausibility slip-ups are so numerous, that even suspension of belief and special effects cannot cover for the absolute ingnorance of science, and absence of common sence withint the storyline, plot, scripting, etc...  every 2-3 minutes there was something that either defied any plausible eplaination of logic, science, or common sense.  in most movies, you have to step outside of fact and logic some...but in this one, you cannot even recognize that either exist.  it was that bad.  i guess maybe the storywriters should probably finish grade school before they start writing their stories, coz a 5th grade student knows that ash suffocates, volcanic gasses asphyxiate, heat will cause spontaneous ignition...all of which would've happenned before the highly unlikely viscious lava flows would have reached.  rubber tires would've been nearly vaporized upon contacting 2000f degree lava, and then the rims, brake dics, and undercarriage would have melted withing a matter of seconds...and oh yeah, where's that gas tank, and what would it have done at such temperatures?  let's also not forget the dog at at least 1000f degrees on the rock in the miffle of the lava flow with all of that asphyxiating gases.    then there's the little problem that acid strong enough to dissolve metal fast enough to sink a bout while you're in it would've dissolve all of the dead fish within seconds, as well as the dock, and event much of the biomatter on the shoreline, creating so much, potent fumes to knock you out cold and lethally unconscious.  then there's the volcano's explosive pressure wave that would knock everything standing down out past 20 miles, followed by the superheated lethally toxic gasses, then the rocks and ash, followed only then with suffocatingly dense/fine ash (not in the lest bit resembling the 'dirty snow' in this movie!), and then comes the 100mph+ pyroclastic flows (as the ash plume collapses), and or course the cement-thick lahare flows.  and again, oh yes, the hot springs incident.  they'd have been boiled, and if acid, then also mostly dissolved.  boy, isn't hollow-wood overrun by ignorants...whom also pretent themselves to be elites.  ...and all of us common folk are supposed to be the mindless, ignorant trogalites.  i give this movie one star, coz they'd not let me rate it a zero for utter inane stupidity.  besides, the special effects are MEH, the acting is almost disinterested, and there is almost an insultingly lowbrow level of character development.  go find a better movie to spend all of your hard-earned money on folks, coz this one's not worthy.  God bless.
B003UESJH4|5.0|A compassionate gripping portrayal of how Prince Albert , Duke of York later George VI (Colin Firth) , with the coaching of the unorthodox and colourful speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Certainly gets to grips with the characters and the frustration and angst suffered by King George. Superb performance as always by Helena Bonham Carter as his wife,  Queen Elizabeth. Begins in 1925 where Prince Albert dismally fails to give a speech at a ceremony the Wembley Stadium,a and takes us through his many efforts to correct his stammer. Covers the crisis caused by Albert's brother Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), a decadent and mean spirited Hitler sympathizer and his infatuation with American divorcee Wallis Simpson, which caused him to give up the throne to a reluctant and nervous Albert.<br />With the help of his family, his government, Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall) and especially Lionel Logue, King George reveals his great ability to lead and addresses the nation in a splendid address at the outbreak of World War II, beginning his role in helping to keep up the morale of the British people against the Nazi enemy during a crucial period of history. Explores a variety of themes including a valuable lesson in how we must always be tolerant of disability, ands how it can be overcome.

B00004X01U|5.0|This is one of Madonna's greater albums ever made.  It's almost a continuation from the \\"Ray of Light\\" album that was the previous album.  I would even consider it a supplement to it.  It's fun, upbeat and will get you through any long road trip drive.  It's not as spiritual or has ambient as \\"Ray of Light\\" was, but it's more of a celebration of that album.  This is definitely a must have even Howard Stern who has knocked Madonna raved about how good this album is.
B001E45XT4|5.0|So far so good with this Headset. It's super comfortable. I've used it multiple times for 4+ hour gaming sessions and it doesn't make my ears sore like my last pair did. The mic works fine and sound quality is solid. They're so comfortable that I've started to use then even if I'm not using the mic, which I never did with my old set.<br /><br />For $25 you really can't beat it for what you get. My brothers have nicer sets but their's cost $120+. So if you're like me and don't want to $120+ on a headset, pick these up they're well worth it.

B005LZW8FO|1.0|The story had potential but whereas similar, \\"What is the meaning of life?\\" movies \\"The Tree of Life\\" and \\"Le Quattro Volte\\" succeeded to a large degree in presenting an engaging visual representation to that question this movie seemed scattered, disjointed, schizophrenic and even factually highly inaccurate. The potential shown in this movie question, \\"What would we really like to see if we could stand outside ourselves and look at us?\\" The movie's answer was shown as inappropriate sex between an older male and young vulnerable female, along with alcoholic enticement and a contest inspired free trip to another Earth. Next we'll see American consumerism at it's best with coupons and TV sing-offs for that final spot.  The vehicle of using another Earth with hypothesized identical selves not only was ridiculously portrayed as a barely visible Earth coming out of nowhere and growing as the movie progressed into a planet so large and so close that most of the physical science we have ever learned is now tossed out the window. So much for education. Meeting identical selves was just plain '50s scifi absurd. The scenes where the custodian decides, for no reason, to blind himself with bleach added nothing. The scenes where the surviving husband has no knowledge of who killed his wife and son and then blindly accepts a young girl appearing out of nowhere to clean his house for free - beyond incredulous. Acting was unemotional and bland - you end up feeling nothing for either of our main characters.   Summary: Given the intriguing question of who we are and ways to evaluate that question the movie failed to offer anything new nor inspirational.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Purchased the Fiio E7 along with a set of ATH-M50 cans, and was a bit skeptical of the amp itself making too much of a difference, but figured \\"why not\\" since I wanted the best aural experience possible. After reciept of both products, I used just the headphones right from my ipod, and was pleased with the results greatly. It was only after I used the line-out from the ipod to the E7 that I was blown away by the superb audio quality, lack of distortion, and all around awesomeness. Sounds amazing also when run as a USB DAC. Live music never sounded so good!
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Yes, financial people behaved irresponsibly, as in \\"driving to endanger,\\" and laws that have been relaxed ever since \\"Reaganomics\\" need to be re-established.

B005O64VH8|4.0|People do seem to have a problem categorizing Secret Garden. I've found them filed over the years under Rock, Pop, Folk, World, New Age, Easy Listening and Classical. Wikipedia has them listed under Neoclassical performers, a type of New Age, but they are certainly Easy to Listen to, and the music is definitely influenced by Irish and (more recently) Chinese Folk music, and, I imagine, Norwegian too. It certainly isn't Rock, and it isn't Ambient in the way I understand Ambient. It is composed and structured; and it is sometimes played in stores and lifts. That puts many people off.  This review is really for those people like me who appreciated the early Neoclassical approach but found it steadily eroded as each album came out. 'Earthsongs', the last 'real' SG release, seemed to be pushing a specifically Christian message in the place of the 'World peace and love' of previous works (The Christianity in 'You Raise Me Up', from the album before it, is very subtly limited to the St Francis imagery in the line 'I am strong when I am on your shoulders', a reference that few non-Christians would recognize); as a non-practising Christian I felt I was being preached to, and avoided Earthsongs' songs in favour of the instrumental tracks. In that area there was also a very deliberate broadening of style, far removed from the first album's uniformity: remove 'The Rap' from 'Songs From a Secret Garden' and you have 40 minutes or so of some of the most beautiful chill out music I know. I understand the need to diversify, but even apart from the lyrics, 'Earthsongs' didn't quite do it for me. (See my review, 'Not their best, but...' on amazon.co.uk).  That was 2005 and I thought I would find out by 2007 if the muse had gone; but here we are, six years after Earthsongs, with 'Inside I'm Singing' the only official SG release in the interim; and if your opinion of SG's career isn't too different from mine, you'll join me in passing over that particular project. I checked out the SGwebsite from time to time, but was caught out by the release of 'Winter Poem'. (In the Northern hemisphere. Those below the equator have to wait until their winter to get it!) I've bought every SG release so far, but I was far from sure I wouldn't be throwing my money away on this one, and the reviews didn't inspire me: it isn't a criticism of the 4 and 5 star reviewers to date to say that I suspect many of them like SG for different reasons to me. Also, the group's website states that the new album was \\"arranged for symphony\\", which suggested that it might not have the simplicity of their best work. So I spun it up, and...  ...liked it from the opening notes!  It's a very clear production, it's very well played, and it's a clear return to an earlier style: I would agree with another reviewer and say it strongly recalls 'White Stones'. Based on a couple of plays, it doesn't reach the highs of 'White Stones', but it is the first SG release since that album to hit the button right on the nose, on several tracks, first time. This might even have been a conscious decision: compare the titles, 'Winter Poem', 'White Stones'. Pretty similar, with the vowels - ie oe - identical. Probably a coincidence, but a telling one.  The downside? The lyrics of some of the songs remain explicitly Christian, one of them is preachingly ecological, and I just don't like any of them. I love Irish airs and ballads (Planxty, The Bothy Band etc), and like all of the singers' voices on this disc, but these songs just grate on me. I've found that with repeated plays the same effect on some of SG's songs on the last 2 or 3 releases has worn off a little, and I've even got to be a little fond of one or two of them, but on this album I'm more inclined to play the six more traditional 'Songs From Secret Garden' - the instrumentals. So one star off.  And that leaves the album's last track, 'Suite: Prelude, Intermezzo, Polka'. Say what? A suite? Fourteen and a half minutes long? SG rarely step outside of 5 mins; their longest to date has been the title track from 'Dawn Of A New Century', at 6:33, so in length at least, this is something of a departure. And otherwise? Well, no, it even references 'Nocturne' from the first album. After a couple of plays it seems a bit fuller than the rest of the album, and obviously longer, but in style very much trademark SG.  As per my comment under  Q. Zhao \\"silentwings\\" review, I disagree that this is formula music. The arrangement, strings, piano, violin, is common to much of their work, but Chopin based most of his career on just one of those instruments, and Satie wrote more than one Gymnopedie. Self-reference is commonplace in art, and I've always felt that much of SG's work is just that, 'art'. Simple, polished, (usually) unpretentious, art. 'Winter Poem' is more of the same. Enjoy!
B00514HDNW|5.0|regardless of what you thought of the movie, READ THIS BOOK! Besides sharing a title and the main characters having the same name is there is absolutely no similarities between the two.  This book Rocks!
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I saw the movie and figured the book would be even better (as most are) and ( was not disappointed - worth the read! That poor kid!
B00005V9HH|5.0|Kevin Spacey does it again!  Here he stars as Verbal Kint, the gimpy lone survivor of a major heist gone wrong.  He weaves a tale so detailed, that we soon start to believe every word he says.  Why shouldn't he?  He has immunity, so why would he lie?  What we find out is that this thing is deeper than we ever thought, and that maybe, just maybe he's not telling the whole truth.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you'll watch again and again and still find new things that you missed the last time.  They may not be huge, but it's still a lot of fun.  This is a great movie, definitely worth the watch.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Well I'm a teen and sad to say, I was obsessed with the shows about gay stereotypes at one point(ie. The L Word, Queer as Folk). This movie is something completely different. The characters were easier to relate to and they have the same issues that we do as average people.        I love that the guys were open in the end, it sends a nice message out to today's gay youth. Being gay is okay and you shouldn't hide it from your family or friends. They might be hurt when you don't tell them and they find out from other people.   This movie didn't portray gays as sex hungry pedophiles that take drugs. The romance was beautiful and I could understand why one of the guys felt so unsure and confused. Some people don't know they're gay till later on in life and this movie says it can take time to get used to -nothing happens over night. You won't always be so uncomfortable in your own skin.       BRAVO!!! I want to see more movies like this and show them to my friends in LGBT youth group. I'm sure the are more symbols and messages that can be taken from this movie. I'm going to watch it a few more times. This picture is absolutely amazing and fantastic!
0345529057|5.0|I bought this set and found it to be exactly as advertised.  Mind you, I don't have a Kindle (they're just not for me) so I bought the antiquated version for paperback.  I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />The price of this set is barely more than that of one hour of work, therefore, I could justify it very easily b/c it ended up taking me five months to complete the boxed set.  The books are very sturdy, they traveled in my backpack every day and took a beating.  The box wasn't that great, my one year old killed it pretty easily (but that's to be expected when destrobot gets his hands on things).  Fortunately, I don't really care.<br /><br />Best part?  You can sell the books back and make most of your money back.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I've thought all along that the first two HP movies were the best. After watching Deathly Hallows my opinion hasn't changed. Hallows looked and felt like a movie trying to find an end, and it finally did. Acting and special effects were excellent, but the Steve Kloves' screenplay left me wanting.  It's hard to believe that both JK Rowling and Warner Bros. Pictures would let such a successful franchise die, so I see a bright future for Harry Potter adventures, no doubt with a completely new slate of actors and characters. Perhaps Harry becomes the headmaster at Hogwarts and stumbles onto another Tom Riddle, or we skip a generation and pick up with the adventures of Albus Potter. It's impossible to predict, but I'm sure Harry will be back in one form or another. I'll be a happy camper when that happens.
031604461X|5.0|Unfortunately, I had an opportunity to read some of the other reviews, which were brutal. I even agreed, in principle, with a lot of them. What saddens me, however, is that so much time and effort was put into ripping this author's creativity apart. Anybody who is that profoundly critical of an author should do one of two things; write your own novel or quit buying books by the offensive author. Gee wiz. The books aren't legislation. They are FICTION for heaven's sake. Your experience with marriage, sexual initiation, or motherhood may be a different experience than that of the author's. Get a clue...everyone's experience is different. Its FICTION. Tip...that means its make believe.   Furthermore, if you guys take such time to rip a new one for this female author - who by-the-way made MILLIONS not only on the book but the movies as well AND re-vitalized the prospects for an obscure town in the process - you ought to have a field day with Walt Disney and themes that are perpetuated persistently in the story lines for his audiences. Talk about hogwash and unrealistic goal setting.   Give Stephanie a break. She was creative. She wrote in a simple everyday conversational style so that those of us with limited vocabularies would still enjoy her work. So she made some bizarre leaps with her character portraits, big woop. I thought it was a very tongue-in-cheek depiction of the bizarre mindsets of unbelievably idealistic, hopeful human-beings we encounter every single day. Like those who attempt to justify there choices in their own minds so that they can continue their own special brand of madness. As well as those who perpetually create their own misery through their thoughts and actions.  I enjoyed the novels. They were incredibly long. Unnecessarily so at points, but it prolonged my experience of this other worldly reality. It gave me a well deserved mini vacation from my own world without commercial interruptions. That is called the joy of reading for pleasure.  Unlike other reviewers, I recall that these books were targeted towards a pre-teen to teen audience. I found that not having read the books before seeing the movies left many holes that the books amply filled. Steamy sex was not required to enjoy this fictional experience.  If you like/want steamy unadulterated vampire sex, try Laurell K. Hamilton. You will get more than your fill with her vampire series.  Its true. The themes set up in this saga, if used as a guideline for living, will unequivocably set little girls up for failure in life, the same way every thing in society does. Our society is afraid of smart powerful women - ask Hillary Clinton - so we try to build false hopes in our little girls to keep them off balance. The truth is, even if you succeed in marrying and procreating with your wealthy first love...you still lose. But that's a different tale seldom told.  If you want to read about that you needn't look to the fiction aisle. They fall into the murder mysteries true life stories category.  That being said, I caution any responsible adult to reiterate that this is just FICTION. Talk to your sons and daughters. The female character tried to be so strong all of the time, even to her detriment. This is very often the case in real life, to the detriment of many a female. The male character failed miserably time and again to live up to his own ideas, false bravado in tact all the way through. Too often true of many males in society, which blow so much smoke from very little fire to the detriment of others. Bernie Madoff ring any bells? Its important to help our youth distinguish between fantasy and reality.  The mind can create beautiful things. Just have a care about what you install there.   As for all of us ADULTS just seeking a little mental escapism, more power to you. I personally admire what Stephanie Meyers has been able to achieve...movie cameo appearances and all. I say Kudos to you. Keep going.  Critics, let it go already. Its just FICTION. Made youthink though, right? Now if we could only get you into Congress. Maybe you could whip THOSE folks into line. :)

0393330435|5.0|IWoz gives a first person perspective to history from the historical person themself in their own words without the taint of the ghost-writer. As much as has been written about Steve Wozniak, and what he brought forward, you would expect a resuscitate-&-regurgitate or a propagation of the myth of Two Steves  and Apple. What is presented here is perspective and detail that just did not make it into everybody else's story.  If you are an engineer, if you are in the information industry this book is above all fresh air, by being in Steve Wozniak's own words. It is informative in that it shows how the events were not just plain luck and serendipity, but a process full of wonder and energy. From the science projects, to the just for fun computer on paper, to the Cream Soda Computer, to the Blue Boxes,  . . . and beyond, the whole revelation is not so much a 'seize the day' as 'hey check this out' or 'why not'.  If you are burnt-out on the whole IT-Industry, this should revive you.  The pranks and jokes are a dimension that just seemed trivia in any other book of the PC birth. Here, with Steve Wozniak telling the story himself, you see the same passion and fun in making a circuit board or simplifying a circuit, gets Richard Nixon's autograph, takes over a dormitory's television, and keeps a healthy level of insanity.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|I'm sort of in the middle with Cowboys & Aliens.  I'll keep this review short and just say that this film's biggest flaw is that its pretty much all over the place.  Is it sci-fi?  Is it a western?  Is it lighthearted romp or to be taken seriously?  I have nothing against genre mash-ups-in fact, there have been several pretty good ones over the years (\\"Outlander\\" for example).  The problem with Cowboys and Aliens though is that it's so busy trying to be everything that it ends up being nothing.  I had heard a lot of mediocre to poor reviews of this film going in, so I already had my expectations in check.  Really though-I wanted to like this movie simply because it's my kind of movie.  When all was said and done though it still managed to disappoint.  It was decent for what it was I suppose and it's impossible not to like Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, but this could have been so much more.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Neil Gaiman is a genius, but sometimes he becomes so epic that he has a hard time figuring out how to end things. American Gods is an example of this. The first 9/10 of the book easily get 5 stars from me, but the end feels anticlimactic. Still, it is a staple for Neil Gaiman fans. It is still a must-read, but be prepared for a fizzle out. This is partly because Neil Gaiman write it to feel more episodic and less like a neat Hollywood Script.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book, you should LOVE Anansi Boys. I feel like Anansi Boys took the concepts explored here and completed them more successfully. I know it is blasphemy for a Gaiman fan to say American Gods isn't their favorite, but this is how I truly feel. It is a very solid 4 stars, but the end left me unsatisfied.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|I admit that I have grown tired of hearing the same old Christmas songs rerecorded by a multitude of artists throughout the years. It is really refreshing to find an album with with a collection of songs that are traditional but only occassionally recorded or recorded/performed mostly by choirs. I particularily love her arrangement of The Holly and The Ivy, which is typically only recorded by choirs. Many other songs are traditional lyrics for which she wrote new melodies or arranged their traditional melodies. A few of the songs are traditional songs that I had never heard before: The Seven Rejoices of Mary, Noel Nouvelet, Glouchester Wassail. A few use traditional words combined with different traditional melodies. I have found that songs I did not originally find that impressive have grown on me. Overall a lovely album worth listening to during the Christmas season.  If you enjoy discovering rarely recorded traditional Christmas/Winter songs, I would also recommend Sting's If On A Winter's Night. But I must warn you that his album is not a happy one. While I wouldn't call it depressing, as many of his reviewers did, I would say his themes are often of hardship and longing during the winter months.

B005LB1MY6|3.0|I like and understand the concept Justice was going for with this album. I like the fact that AVD is very disco-y and has an almost rockin feel to it. I feel like it's an Ok album. It has a lot of potential. I just feel like they lost they're funk with this one. I wasn't expecting a remake of cross, or even planisphere material, but this album is just extremely lacking in a lot of ways. One of my favorite aspects of Justice was how soulful and funky they made electro music. There was emotion behind it, but with AVD theres little if no emotion, it's very flat during most parts. It doesn't have the dynamics or flow that they had in past albums. It's a good listen but this album just doesn't bring what Justice is capable of. I mean maybe they'll have a slammin live delivery and jam out a bit, but as for an album it's mediocre. This album is very repetitious, almost if you took queen and made it into a trance album. The best songs on the album in my opinion are helix and on n on, but even with these songs I feel they could have delivered more.
B005V4FJC4|1.0|I bought this CD at Starbucks, thinking it would be nice to have some Christmas music in the car, and recalling \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" from the movie Elf. Unfortunately, this CD and that song are nothing alike.  If you like, or are looking for \\"Christmas-y\\" Christmas music, this is not the CD for you.  If you want Christmas music that is so slow as to feel like it's incredibly dragging, making you wonder if \\"she\\" forgot the song she was singing, then this is for you.  Oh, and the way \\"she\\" sings it, shows all the flaws in her voice, and makes sure you know you wasted your money.  Bottom Line -- just buy something different.

B003Y5H5FG|2.0|As a big fan of [[ASIN:0767817664 the original film]], I had serious misgivings about seeing the remake. It took David Tennant to get me to give it a try.<br /><br />Yes, I know he's the [[ASIN:B000JBWWP6 Doctor Who]] guy, but while that's what originally brought him to my attention, I've been following his work since, and man is he one talented actor. His portrayal of [[ASIN:B0038RSJ0U Hamlet]], for instance, was stellar. The man has serious acting chops.<br /><br />But the screenplay lets him and his otherwise capable co-stars down. Dull, by-the-numbers, and banal action sequences attempt to carry the day through special effects what wit and skilled directing did in the original.<br /><br />I understand why Tennant did the film. UK television and cinema may be challenging, but American film is where the money's to be had. The man can be a fine actor, but he has to pay his bills like all the rest of us.<br /><br />That said, he did a capable job here in an otherwise undistinguished film and I'm hoping it leads to better roles for him in the future.<br /><br />In the meantime ... do yourself a favor and see the original instead. It may be dated, but it's still much better than this mishmash.

B004LWZW4W|4.0|When I first saw the trailers for RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, I had several thoughts: What an awful title; James Franco is doing his wooden caricature thing again; animated animals mixed with live-action humans hasn't really worked since WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT; and do we really need this, or is Hollywood milking yet another franchise for all it's worth?<br /><br />Well, the latter may be the case, but at least they're doing it right this time.  First, the flaws: the script is necessarily short, with several films' worth of info crammed into 100 minutes; there are too many side-stories that deviate from the main plot; the storyline is predictable, and plays upon everything even remotely similar that's come before it; and quite honestly, it takes too long for the apes to revolt.  In fact, the film could have benefited from an R rating; there doesn't need to be any (more) violence/gore, but darker tones could have been examined further.  The film's greatest scenes are the ones that truly make you ponder the horrendous possibility of nature turning its claws on us.<br /><br />These are the flaws, and there are several.  However, there are a lot of good things about APES, even a couple of great things.  Director Rupert Wyatt knows how to craft a great shot, and the pace remains steady, even when the script is tempted to dip into maudlin schmaltz.  James Franco's performance is delightfully nuanced; he's been better elsewhere, but we've also seen him far, far worse.  Andy Serkis more or less carries this film; I don't know if his performance is truly Oscar-worthy, but it's certainly more worthy than some past winners (admittedly, I have pretty high standards).  Serkis utterly changes the tone of the film with a simple look.  Supporting roles aren't quite fleshed out (Frida Pinto, as Franco's girlfriend, is pretty much there for female support/companionship), but certain actors (namely, John Lithgow, as always) make the most of them.  Also look for Tom Felton doing his Draco Malfoy thing, and for some reason it's not tiring, probably because nobody does petulant bullying better than him, at least not since the 80's.<br /><br />RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is far from perfect; and indeed, there have been better--and bigger--summer blockbusters.  But it's still a fun ride, filled with great visuals (I hesitate to use the term \\"special effects,\\" as it seems somewhat dated) and pretty solid acting.  I'm not sure if the film has sold me on a sequel (and you know one is coming), but it's definitely a solid examination of the origins of the original series, both overtly and subtly.  Definitely a must-see for science-driven thriller fans, and those interested in just HOW those damned dirty apes took control of humanity.

B000002KHH|5.0|English hard rockers Black Sabbath released its second album entitled Paranoid in October of 1970 in their native UK and then in early January of 1971 here in the States.<br />By the summer of 1970, Black Sabbath (which comprised of singer Ozzy Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward and bass player/lyricist Geezer Butler) released their incredible debut album which gave birth to the heavy metal movement (despite the fact the band don't (like Led Zeppelin) consider themselves heavy metal) which was zooming up the charts and the group had gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. With the momentum going, the band decided to go back to the recording studio (once again Regent Sound Studios plus Island Studios with Rodger Bain producing and Tom Allom engineering) to record the sophomore album. When Paranoid came out, would it either improve on an already great debut or would the band become a one album wonder. Read on and find out, as I did in late 1986/early 1987 when I acquired on cassette tape.<br />We begin with \\"War Pigs\\". This is one heavy track and was the band's critique on war. Originally called \\"Walpurgis\\" (about witches), they luckily changed the lyrics to reflect the Vietnam War. This song just rocks. The outro to this is called \\"Luke's Wall\\" but is better known as ending to \\"War Pigs\\". Next is Black Sabbath's signature song which is Paranoid's title cut. This straight-forward rocker was originally wrote as a filler tune to balance the album sides out but this filler track was great. Who would have thought of this? Ozzy and Sabbath (without Ozzy) would close shows with this Sabbath classic. In fact, Warner Bros (the band's North American label) had the band name the album title to Paranoid due to the Vietnam War happening around Paranoid's release and the title War Pigs didn't seem right so the US label called the album Paranoid (and the rest is history). Next is the languid and relaxing \\"Planet Caravan\\" which is somewhat bizarre but a great tune. Ozzy's voice singing through a Leslie speaker (the speakers used on Hammond Organs) make him almost unrecongnizable. Iommi's playing is excellent and also there is some keyboards at the end of this track (played by Tom Allom). Texas metal gods Pantera would cover years later. We end the first side with the classic rock radio/album rock staple of \\"Iron Man\\". This killer rocker is rightfully a classic and tells the tale of a person who time travels only to be turned to steel and seek revenge on those who ignored him! This track has appeared on Sabbath and Ozzy solo tours as well as movies and was the entrance music for pro wrestlers The Road Warriors during their time in the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance) when they'd go to the ring and annihilate their opponents.<br />The second side of the album begins with the classic Sabbath piece (and criminally underrated) \\"Electric Funeral\\". This song rocks and its lyrics are dark, politically-angry with a touch of sci-fi thrown in. Also it has tempo changes often seen by bands like King Crimson were doing at the time in this tune. Next is \\"Hand Of Doom\\" and is a perfect example of what the British called \\"Light and Shade\\" with the quiet verse then rocking chorus and heavy middle section. The lyrics speak about doom, gloom, death and what a great track. Criminally overlooked. Next is the rocking instrumental \\"Rat Salad\\" which rocks. It also features a stellar drum solo from Mr. Bill Ward who is criminally underrated as a drummer. At a time were everyone was giving props to Ginger Baker, John Bonham, Carmine Appice and Keith Moon as the ROCK DRUMMER EXTRAORDINAIRES, Ward was conspicuously absent from the GREAT ROCK DRUMMER LISTS. We close proceedings with \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\". The intro riff and middle section of this piece is called \\"Jack the Stripper\\" and is a kick*ss intro before we proceed into \\"Fairies\\" proper with its swinging drum beat, pummeling riff and slightly odd lyrics but a great song!<br />Paranoid wouldhit #1 in the band's native UK and would become their first US Top 10 album peaking at #8 and is their highest selling album of original material during the original lineup's time together (though more great albums would come Sabbath's way over the next 40 someodd years).<br />RECOMMENDED!band's native UK and would become their first US Top 10 album peaking at #8 and is their highest selling album of original material during the original lineup's time together (though more great albums would come Sabbath's way over the next 40 someodd years).

B0002VKZL6|5.0|I've owned this album for a few months now and it has had plenty of play during my commute, at work, and at home.  This is NOT a Dire Straits album - it is not fast, not exciting, not guitar dominated, and the songs are not epic in scope.  If this is what you are looking for then you will be disappointed, as some reviewers have.  With Amazon you can check out the samples so there's no excuse for buying the album with false expectations.  The album is relaxed, folksy, wistful, ironic, lyrical, clever, musical and catchy.  It is a physically relaxing joy to listen to but at the same time if you invest some energy into it, then it pays you back.  At first \\"Boom Like That\\" is the go-to song, then you research the lyrics a bit and find out about Ray Kroc and the song takes on new life.  You then do the same for Sonny Liston, George Bush Snr, etc and get the same expanded sense of joy when you hear the songs.  This album will appeal to a listener whose own experiences resonate with the lyrics, who has developed a joyous philosophical resignation to life's ups and downs, and who apreciates intelligent lyrics (but this isn't a cerebral album - it's melodic and musical).  If you like Paul Simon's \\"So Beautiful So What\\" then it's likely to appeal.  I find the album compares very favourably to Mark Knoffler's other solo outings.

0441013597|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books ever written.  I've read the entire series twice - I like them all but Dune stands alone as the best of the bunch.  BTW - don't bother with the \\"prequel\\" novels, those all suck.  It really isn't possible to summarize the plot in a short review because... well... it just isn't.  You'll just have to take my word for it - like you should always do.  The nutshell is that the entire galaxy is addicted to drugs - specifically, \\"spice\\".  The spice opens the mind, allows space travel, and is only on one planet.  Unlike weed, which turns your eyes red, spice turns your eyes blue.  The plot is basically a Mexican drug war in space - except one of the drug lords is a selectively bred super-human who uses drugs to open a big can on his enemies a ride giant sand worms like wild horses.  Hmmmm... very similar to my own life actually - except I have groupies...  After reading Dune, I figured that starting a drug habit might be a good idea.  I started with Weed, it was smooth, but soon bored me.  Therefore, I moved on the meth, cocaine, crack, and heroin.  Heroin just didn't do it for me - the needles sucked and I was always passing out in public parks, bathrooms, and behind dumpsters.  One time, I woke up when the garbage truck came and picked the dumpster up right in front of me.  Good thing I wasn't in the dumpster that time!  I think the closest thing I could find to \\"spice\\" was probably LSD.  It was awesome because I found one of those fancy freeman water suits online and would put it on when I dropped the acid.  Then, I'd hang out in my living room and be like \\"ahhhhh I'm in the desert!  Ahhhhh I'm so thirsty!  Ahhhhh I'm riding a sand worm!  Riding a sand worm! Weeeeeeeee....Weeeeeeeee... ahahahahahahahaahaha!!\\"  Good times.... Yeah... good times.  I'm blind now.  I freaked out once after getting me a pair of those crazy \\"dune\\" blue contact lenses and looking in the mirror.  I was ripped out of my mind on the hash and forgot that I'd put the contact lenses in.  I looked at my reflection and stabbed my eyes out with a tweezers.  It is ok though - now I wear a patch over each eye and play \\"hide the eyeball\\" with my nieces and nephews.  Which patch is it under?  Left or right? Hehehe... oh boy do they love that game.  Sometimes I'll give the kids a little surprise and put a marble in the hole or maybe a small plastic animal or lego toy.  I've also found that little LED lights are a big crowd pleaser.  Plus, when I close my eyelid over the hole, you can see the lights flashing on and off in there!  Anyway, there are a lot of self-righteous pinky-in-the-air coffee house review writers filling up the review pages with their swill.  Unfortunately, a lot of those reviewers will put Dune on their top lists just because sci-fi fans pretty much think that is what you are supposed to do.  Not so with me.  I'm recommending it just because it is good.  If it wasn't good, it would qualify for the fabled Hall of Suck.
0375703764|1.0|This book is convoluted for the sake of being convoluted and allows pseudo eccentrics to continue bolstering their own nihilism.   Oh my goodness, I had to turn a page upside down to read it... So scary. Give me a break.   If you bought your kid a Toyota, and he/she complains that his/her life is ruined because it's not a BMW, they will enjoy this book.

B006B3975Y|4.0|The Roots Undun is quite simply a cold dose of reality on some primarily laid back tracks. Those looking for club music don't even bother, this is much more serious. The only real downfall to this cd is the last part of it, that features some instrument tracks. There isn't much appeal in those few short tracks. One of which turns into pretty much choatic instrumental noise. The rest of the cd though is brilliant. If only there were more rap groups with this much talent.
B005K2XWR6|5.0|Sturdy and well constructed.  The Fire slides in snugly and seems to be well protected.  I can easilly put this in a backpack or just carry it like a book.  The velcro holds tight.  There were no surprises.  I did read a review that said this had a loose fit that let the Kindle slide around.  All I can think of is that he has the wrong sleeve.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second in the series doesn't disappoint. Also super easy to download to my Ipad. I really like the books and I love using my Ipad for reading them.
B00007K5C0|5.0|It was an Elton John CD that caused me to return my first CD player, it sounded horrible (compared to LP) tape hiss noise galore. As usual, when the record company has more impressive sound to offer (remixed/remastered), they'll also offer it as a HDCD set, sort of like Sony does with Blu-Spec. Anyway, for now, this is a fine (Japan issued) CD set, with great detailed sound of instruments. I can't say the US issued rendition will sound the same.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was shockingly surprised how easily I got hooked on the first book in the trilogy. I immediately downloaded the other two. It kept me spellbound from the very beginning. Love downloading ebooks on my ipad. Too easy!
B005JSM5YW|5.0|I planned on this movie being good, but it was so great! Ryan Gosling is truely a gem of an actor. Steve Carell is fantastic. There is a great twist in the movie which no one I've talked to saw coming. It has more than one story line going throughout so it keeps it interesting.<br />My husband & I went to see this in the theaters. Normally I don't drag him to see movies that would qualify as chick flicks, but he likes Carell & Gosling so he was actually interested in seeing it as well. We saw in theaters & loved it so much I had to own it when it came out. Emma Stone is great in this movie as well. Overall the cast was entertaining & did a great job in this film. My only issue was towards the end when the babysitter gives a gift to Carell & Moore's son. I found it a bit disturbing & inappropriate. But the rest of the movie is fun & entertaining & I'm recommending to everyone!
0060873027|4.0|Quick blurb.<br />This was thoroughly enjoyable if read in the right light. That being you're looking for a quick, fun, and entertaining escape. Nothing to be taken too seriously in this thriller but that. I liked it for that reason.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Timeless movie about an episode in American history that must be taught to our children today.  Very PG movie so kids can view it.  Schools don't evan mention December 7th, 1941 anymore.  Its has a docu-drama film style to it but is never boring.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I must admit I was somewhat skeptical upon hearing of plans to reboot the APES franchise, but this prequel is quite entertaining.<br />The movie focuses on a brilliant young scientist who is developing a drug that may cure Altzheimer's.  While experimenting on apes, a dangerous side affect of increased aggression results in the cessation of the project.  The determined scientist sneaks one of the baby apes out of the lab and continues the experiment on his own.  This ape is \\"Caesar\\" who is destined to be the leader of the future rebellion and ultimate \\"rise.\\"<br />James Franco, Frieda Pinto, John Lithgow and Tom Felton are fine as the humans but it is Andy Serkis' \\"motion captured\\" performance that is the true heart of the film.  All of Caesar's desires, emotions, reactions are beautifully evidenced and provide the movie's dramatic pulse.<br />The FX are quite good with a dynamic climactic confrontation on the Golden Gate Bridge.<br />RISE is the best APES film since the classic original; I think Charlton Heston would be proud.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'll be honest - I don't like books told in the first person, I don't like time travel books, and I especially don't like conspiracy theory books.  All of those combined made me hesitate before purchasing this book.  I finally decided to give it a try - I've always been a fan of King's huge novels like The Stand, It, Under The Dome, etc.  And Duma Key wasn't a half bad first person story.  I purchased the Kindle edition and was surprised how quickly I got into it.  It starts a little slow - Stephen King focuses his energy on the surroundings and describing the past, but once the main character heads to Derry and you start seeing crossovers with novels such as It, and the reappearance of the Takuro Spirit, you will be hooked.  I found myself actually getting mad when the main character did something I didn't think he should, or hurting for him when something didn't work out.  At risk of giving away any plot elements, I found I wanted the main character to abandon his main quest before he got in too deep - I would have been ok with that ending!!  King brings real world characters to life in this fictional setting, and that concept really works.  After reading this, I read a Dean Koontz novel (The Husband), and the shallowness of that novel made me really appreciate the effort that Stephen King puts into character development.  No other author does what he does, and this will become a classic mentioned along with novels like the Shining, Carrie, etc. in my opinion.  Great read, nice long read, well worth the money.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I was not really sure what this film was about, but I gave it a try.  It had rich twists in the plot.  My opinion of a film depends on how much I think about it later.  This film made me think about what love is in this messed up world of imperfect people.  I'd recommend watching this.  I wish more American films had the depth of this one.
0316017930|1.0|Malcolm Gladwell, at the end of the audio version of this book, admits that this is his \\"manifesto\\" for his philosophy. That being \\"Luck and circumstances determine success, NOT individual effort.\\" He says people should not be compensated based on the value they produce. I have no problem with the idea that luck/upbringing/circumstances are a PART of success, but to say that individual effort is not part of the equation (or that it, too, is determined purely by circumstances) is silly. So this book, although it gives many good examples of how circumstances are necessary to produce an EXTREME outlier like Bill Gates, ends up being a silly book. And possibly a dangerous book, in the hands of some liberal politicians. There is a reason the USA out-produces Canada, where Malcolm Gladwell is from. If your attitude is \\"my effort does not matter, I'm a victim\\", you simply won't try very hard, because your effort makes no difference.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|This out of the way, I was never much for death metal. But then I kept hearing how Opeth flirted with progressive rock, and this new release, even more so, with Mikael Åkerfeldt dispensing with those monster growling vocals. The story goes that Porcupine Tree had inspired Opeth to go more progressive, and Opeth inspired PT to get more heavy. The mixing of Heritage was done by both Steven Wilson and Mikael Åkerfeldt. I have never heard any of Opeth's other releases, so they are new to me. Of course, I didn't expect this group to suddenly become Yes or Genesis, more of heavy rock with progressive overtones, and I was right. Maybe a little like King Crimson during their more heavy moments or Anekdoten (the presence of Mellotron sure helps). Also I loved how they acquired a real Mellotron this time around, a Mark VI (basically an improved M400, which is even compatible with M400 tapes). For guests they even brought in Peruvian-born percussionist Alex Acuña, who had played in the likes of Weather Report, and veteran Swedish flautist Björn J:son Lindh (for years I used to wonder why his middle name was J:son, then I discovered it was an abbreviation of Johansson). The title track is a short piano intro. \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" is heavy rock, while \\"I Feel the Dark\\" starts off acoustic, with some nice Mellotron passages, with some heavy moments. \\"Slither\\" a song dedicated to Ronnie James Dio, and tends to the heavier side. \\"Famine\\" starts off pretty strange, but when they get settled down, one starts drawing comparisons to Jethro Tull, because of the flute, played by Lindh. \\"Marrow of the Earth\\" is basically an all-acoustic piece. No matter if the band was being heavy or not there's that doomy undercurrent to be found throughout.  I have the Special Edition, which the artwork features that similar 3-D effect as found on the Rolling Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request. Plus you get a bonus DVD that includes a 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound mix of the album, two bonus cuts,\\"Pyre\\" and \\"Face in the Snow\\", and a documentary on the Making of Heritage. My favorite part is where drummer Martin Axenrot shows his skills, and it plainly shows what an accomplished drummer he is. I'm certain I'm not the only one, but I was wishing they'd used the subtitles throughout and not just when they're speaking Swedish as it's often difficult to understand what they're saying. I understand English is not the mother tongue of any of the band members (and not even Swedish for bassist Martin Mendez as he hails from Uruguay). At least Mikael Åkerfeldt attempts to make his English loud and clear, Martin Mendez appears to be camera shy and I can barely understand anything he says, making me wished there were subtitles. But on the other hand, you get to see the instruments being used. I also noticed how Åkerfeldt kept saying how Heritage was going to be different from what they done before. He very much shied from the word \\"prog\\", probably not to scare off his fans. This was to be Per Wiberg's final album with them. Their new keyboardist is Joakim Svalberg, who already played the piano on the title track.  This album is not easy to get into. There are some slow passages that require your full attention. This will certainly divide their fans, but on the other hand, their more prog inclined fans will likely have less trouble with it than their more metal-inclined fans. Also given so much of my collection consists of albums that never charted, I am really amazed to no end of the chart success Heritage is receiving. It actually made the Billboard Top 20. I just love it when a band like Opeth sneaks prog for the masses. Remember how Radiohead also sneaked in prog for OK Computer nearly a decade and a half ago and it was a smash success, I get reminded of the same for Opeth, even if they hardly sound alike, naturally.  I don't know what else to say, but if you've been put off by the band in the past because of those growling vocals, give this one a try, none of thatto be found here. I recommend this to even prog rock fans!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Simon Curtis' \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" tells all in the title. It's the story of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), an aristocratic, well-ccnnected young Englishman, and how he had a brief fling with Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) while serving as a production assistant on the film \\"The Prince and the Showgirl.\\" The film, though very well-made, is pretty much a trifle, except for the astonishing performances of Williams and of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier.<br /><br />Seeing production stills before I saw the movie, I didn't know how Williams was going to bring off playing Monroe; with her round, girlish face, she looks nothing like Monroe, and being dressed, made up and coiffed in full Marilyn drag only emphasizes her lack of resemblance. But this turned out to make no difference, for Williams becomes Monroe to the life, capturing her incandescence, her crippling insecurities, her manipulative flirtatiousness. If there is a more consistently impressive young American actress than Michelle Williams, I don't know who it might be.<br /><br />Like Williams, Branagh bears no physical resemblance whatever to the world-famous actor he's playing, though his resume makes him a natural to play Olivier (even down to his directing and starring in his own versions of \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"Henry V\\"). Branagh nicely captures Olivier's magnificence of voice and gesture, but even more, he captures something of Olivier's soul. Watch Branagh's close-ups, and particularly his eyes; on several occasions his eyes have that wild, imperious look that Olivier alone had, and no other actor in cinematic history.<br /><br />I was less impressed with Eddie Redmayne; he was likable, but essentially just Richie Cunningham with a posh accent. The rest of the players, though, are superb. I was particularly gratified to see Judi Dench playing Dame Sybil Thorndike as a fount of thespian and worldly wisdom. Emma Watson, Derek Jacobi, Zoe Wanamaker, Philip Jackson, Toby Jones, Dominic Cooper and Julia Ormond also acquit themselves well. \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" is well worth seeing as a splendid showing for British Rep, as well as one American interloper.. \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" is well worth seeing as a splendid showing for British Rep, as well as one American interloper.

0545157617|5.0|He's not just a stick, he's Stick MAN, yet to everyone else around him, he's simply a stick to fetch, throw, weave into, and used as a sandcastle mast. Alas, all Stick man wants to do is return to his Stick Lady Love, and their stick children three, after going for a routine morning jog.<br /><br />\\"One day he wakes early and goes for a jog.<br />Stick Man, Oh Stick Man, beware of the dog!<br />A stick, barks the dog,<br />An excellent stick!<br />The right kind of stick<br />for my favorite trick!\\"<br /><br />Thus begins Stick Man's adventures as various play toys and employment in alternative utilitarian uses as he pines (pun intended) to return to his \\"family tree\\".  Just as Stick Man is sure to meet his demise, he finds himself in for a fortuitous surprise;) At the beginning it doesn't appear that Stick Man is a  Christmas story, but then abruptly, it turns into one. I suppose I could make an issue of that, but I enjoyed Donaldson's play with words too much. There's just one brief moment where the rhyming gets a bit awkward, but not enough to impact what does work well.<br /><br />Once again, the author collaborates with illustrator Axel Scheffler as they have in several other books. One of my favorites,[[ASIN:0142501123 Room on the Broom]], has his same distinctive style; characters have big round eyes and his use of black to outline objects in his illustrations, which I find appealing and whimsical.<br /><br />This was my holiday book to read this year to grades 1-5 and it was a big hit.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|For whatever reason, Westerns have not been a hot genre in the movie business for quite some time. Cowboys and Aliens did not bolster that confidence.  I will give the team credit for creating an interesting mix of western and sci-fi. Kudos as well for combining Han Solo with James Bond. These are two iconic actors with great acting chops.  Harrison Ford does a great job as a cynical old war horse who's plagued with a fool for a son. Daniel Craig passes as a man who has forgotten everything about his past yet loves his hat...that crazy hat.  I thought the aliens were well done. Even though Steven Spielberg had a hand in this film, you will not find friendly ETs anywhere. These creatures want our gold and are insanely fast.  The script was decent. You can't blame the film too much whenever the script passes through as many hands as this one did. While the plot seems to drag often, you can always play the fun game of guessing how many times Craig will take off or put on his freaky hat.  Bottom line: good attempt at creating something fun & new but I was really hoping for something so much better.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|i first saw this movie on DVD, then decided to seek out the blu-ray but found that in the US, an official blu-ray version was not released by Lionsgate.  i researched and found that the french warner bros. blu-ray version of this movie is closest to the english version presented in this DVD, it is full english TrueHD audio as well as 1080p video and english text displayed throughout sections of the film. i bought it from amazon.fr.  concerning the movie itself, it is a very well made film that i enjoyed. the story and cinematography are done quite well, the acting is very good, you will not find a single scene in the film that is pointless or just there for filler. the props and settings of the film were believable and authentic looking, i like how the director used a zoom in/out from scenes on the surface to being out in space looking at the earth, while also fading audio in/out of these transitions nicely.  it's really a shame this movie hasn't been presented in the US on blu-ray, it is an incredible story and a superbly done film. not like much of the fictitious hollywood garbage that's been eroding the minds of movie-goers over the past several years.  the blu-ray transfer of this movie is stunning: color, lighting, details, audio are all right on the money. blu-ray.com reviewed this release and rated it nearly at the top, 4.5 out of 5. not many blu-ray transfers are rated that good for overall quality and reproduction of the film onto blu-ray format.  those like myself that enjoy movies set back in this era or in ancient times, Agora is a film that will make Troy look like a kid's flick. get it and enjoy it.  you must have a multi-region player because the disc is locked to region 2.

1416549447|1.0|The timing of the first publication of ChiRunning is important. Dr. Romanov, a Russian sports scientist and Olympic coach, published \\"Pose Running\\" in 2002 (he had been teaching the technique in clinics and on DVD's for years before that). Dreyer's 2004 \\"ChiRunning\\" technique is not far from being a dead ringer for the technique published two years earlier by Romanov.  Hence, the claim that ChiRunning is a \\"ground breaking\\" technique is, quite simply, false (Romanov himself began by analyzing the techniques of world class runners, and so he doesn't boast of being a ground breaker). If a book begins with false claims, buyer beware. Dreyer has tweaked Romanov's technique in a couple of important ways. Romanov advocates landing on the ball of the foot, while Dreyer advocates landing on the midfoot. Dreyer doesn't, however, explain what the \\"midfoot\\" is. Is it the arch of the foot? If so, how does one land first on the arch of the foot? The toes, ball, or heel of the foot have a nasty habit of preventing an arch-first strike unless the runner lands on the outside of the foot (known as \\"supination\\") or the inside of the foot (\\"pronation\\"), which not even Dreyer recommends. Or when Dreyer refers to the midfoot, does he really just mean the ball of the foot? If so, he is once again plagiarizing Romanov. A \\"certified\\" ChiRunning instructor has an online video and tries to deal with this embarrassing ambiguity by explaining that landing on the midfoot is really just another way of describing landing on the \\"whole\\" foot simultaneously. If so, why didn't Dreyer just say so about something as important as how the foot strikes the ground while running? It wouldn't be the most efficient way to run, but at least there would be some clarity about what is being recommended in a 320 page book that is long on fluff and short on practical detail (an online video of Dreyer running in a race, as opposed to the carefully staged photos in the book, shows him landing heel first). ChiRunning also omits a critical element of the Romanov technique that is critical to learning to run in an efficient way (I tried Dreyer's method before happening upon Romanov's book and am hence speaking from personal experience). Romanov's book includes extensive, easy to understand and follow drills to learn how to run correctly. ChiRunning, on the other hand, devotes only a few pages to recommendations such as rotating your pelvis from your \\"pivot point;\\" i.e., the T12-L1 vertebral level of the spine. The T12-L1 vertebral level is not a Tai Chi concept. And try looking anywhere to find support from a doctor, physical therapist, professor of anatomy, or anyone other than Mr. Dreyer that the pelvis rotates from one particular part of the spine or that T12-L1 plays a unique and \\"pivotal\\" role in the spine, let alone pelvic rotation. Dreyer, a carpenter, doesn't provide any references for his claim. And even if such a pivot point existed, his recommendation would be useless. When spine surgeons perform surgery, they use X-rays to count the spinal vertebrae to make sure they are operating at the correct level. If a spine surgeon needs an X-ray to be confident of being at a particular spinal level even though the surgeon can look at an anesthetized patient's naked back and feel the vertebrae, what chance does an ordinary runner have of concentrating on one out of 17 thoracic and lumbar vertebral levels that the runner can't see or feel? If you are mistakenly concentrating on rotating your pelvis from one level above or below T12-L1, is that going to set you back because your mental gaze has missed the \\"pivot\\" point? Dreyer has another exercise in which you place fingers near your collarbone and on your lower back to \\"lengthen\\" your spine. If a spine could be lengthened so simply, there would be millions of kids aspiring to life in the NBA walking around with their fingers on their collarbones and lower backs trying to lengthen their spines. What Dreyer recommends is just a gimmick for adjusting a person's posture, and it has no practical value for running. If you doubt that, try running the same distance with and without \\"lengthening\\" your spine before you set out (not even Dreyer recommends the lengthening procedure while running) and compare your times and exertion levels.  I mention these examples because they expose Dreyer's utter lack of expertise or even basic understanding regarding the anatomy and mechanics of the human body (he talks at one point about the medial meniscus tendon; he probably means the medial collateral ligament, because there is no medial meniscus tendon, but with Dreyer you never know). In 2002 Terry Laughlin, a swimming coach, published a fine book on swimming that includes several yoga concepts (Laughlin had been conducting clinics for years prior to that). Dreyer admits that he tried, in part, to pattern ChiRunning after Laughlin's approach. That included starting ChiRunning clinics and copying various words and phrases Laughlin uses in his book, such as \\"effortless\\" and using different \\"gears.\\" Is it possible that Dreyer read Romanov's highly technical, detailed Pose Running, read Laughlin's practical swimming book that includes yoga references, and decided that he could market Romanov's technique by sprinkling in some Tai Chi (if you want to learn Tai Chi, you will need to look elsewhere than ChiRunning) and claiming it as Dreyer's own revolutionary and ground breaking method? If so, it appears to have been a highly profitable marketing ploy and expropriation of another person's work. But buyer beware. And beware the many five star reviews. There are marketing companies that will write positive reviews for products. There are also a lot of \\"certified\\" ChiRunning instructors and this is, after all, big business, not a revolutionary new way of running.mick for adjusting a person's posture, and it has no practical value for running.

That included starting ChiRunning clinics and copying various words and phrases Laughlin uses in his book, such as \\"effortless\\" and using different \\"gears.\\" Is it possible that Dreyer read Romanov's highly technical, detailed Pose Running, read Laughlin's practical swimming book that includes yoga references, and decided that he could market Romanov's technique by sprinkling in some Tai Chi (if you want to learn Tai Chi, you will need to look elsewhere than ChiRunning) and claiming it as Dreyer's own revolutionary and ground breaking method? If so, it appears to have been a highly profitable marketing ploy and expropriation of another person's work. But buyer beware. And beware the many five star reviews. There are marketing companies that will write positive reviews for products. There are also a lot of \\"certified\\" ChiRunning instructors and this is, after all, big business, not a revolutionary new way of running.
0307346617|1.0|I realize I'm in the minority here, but the interview style Mr. Brooks elects to use just doesn't cut it for me.  I'm a huge fan of the zombie genre and can deal with minimal character development if the action doesn't allow for it, but this doesn't have much of either.  I'm also not a fan of books or movies that start at the end then flip to the beginning.  The very fact that this is a series of interviews lets the reader know that at the end of it all humanity is alive and well collecting journal entries about the horrible events that took place.  Yes, I knew that going in, but with all the hype surrounding the book I decided to give it a whirl after all Fallen and Cloverfield shared that as a similar feature (granted as movies) and I enjoyed both of those.  To me, the story told in interview fashion was flat.  I never could lose myself in the tale the character was telling, and certainly never got invested in the individual stories.  I didn't expect this subject to be as unexciting as it came across.  Clinical, lacking warmth, and character differentiation this is probably technically correct work, but lacks the heart and soul I look for in a book.  If you like the genre and can get invested in the story I expect this would rate much higher.
B003ZWTGKU|3.0|Yes, Jonas Kaufmann is a great singer.  The singing in general is great.  Lovely soprano.  Music is fun.  Not a especially deep plot or characters but hey that's ok.  Perhaps if I just dropped it in and listed to it like a CD but it's not; it's a DVD.  Arg.  Forget the willing suspension of disbelief- the person who shot the opera's video, killed it.  Video of Jonas waiting in the wings, others waiting in the wings, shots from directly overhead, from backstage, weird closeups of the head of the person being sung to while the person singing is obscured, ahh death, wait no up they go, watch them get comfy, and then lights up.  Oh, did I mention there was music under all this - really the whole point of the thing is music. The videographer has no faith in the opera and seems determined to imprint himself on it.  As a video, it's dreck.   You've got stars carrying a pretty good conventional opera.  It is what it is and that's pretty good.  Let it be.

0446585025|5.0|Are you an Ellen fan? If so, you'll enjoy SERIOUSLY . . . I'M KIDDING (Hachette Audio) by Ellen DeGenerres.<br /><br />It's a collection of her observations on a wide range of topics, presented in short chapters that make you feel as if you are having a one-on-one conversation with the stand-up comedian and television host. There's even some good advice thrown in along the way:<br /><br />* How to become a billionaire:<br /><br />Number 1. Make a lot of money.<br />Number 2. Don't spend it.<br /><br />In addition, DeGenerres includes an entire chapter devoted to tweeting for those interested in that technology:<br /><br />* This is a tweet chapter. An observation in 140 characters.<br /><br />How come when you wipe up  dust, it's called dusting? But when you wipe up a spill, it's not called spilling? Just something to think about.<br /><br />Not every part of the book will have you laughing out loud, but you'll certainly find yourself smiling as I did when I heard the following:<br /><br />* Everyone tries to multitask and do twelve different things at once. I once saw a woman talking on the phone, putting on makeup, reading a newspaper, texting, twittering, all at the same time. I went right over to her and said, \\"Hey, you need to focus right now. You are my therapist.\\"<br /><br />And on that note, I need to also stop multitasking and start focusing on important stuff--like watching Ellen on her television show, which is beginning just as I finish this sentence.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are perfect for me for running because I can't use in ear or over ear headphones when I run.  I have always had a hard time finding a pair that will stay put.  With these the price is right and so is the function and sound.    I run 15 miles a week and have been using these now for about 6 months with no issues so I would say that they are plenty durable as well.
0446547654|4.0|I must admit to being a big Nicholas Sparks fan, and I think I've read just about every book he has written. Most of them I have really enjoyed, too.<br /><br />I wouldn't quite put THE BEST OF ME (Hachette Audio) in that same category . . . the story about high school sweethearts who reunite 25 years later was quite good in the beginning . . . I liked learning about each of the main characters; i.e., until the violent parts started taking away from the story.<br /><br />And overall, there was too much violence for a romantic story of this type.<br /><br />What's worse: The ending was way too predictable. I guessed it way before the ending of the book and when it came out exactly as I thought it would, I was disappointed that the author hadn't gone in a different direction . . . or at least not been so obvious with his clues along the way.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book is more than just a book on business... it's a book on how to live your life.  Mark Cuban explains how to live your life to the fullest and to view every opportunity as a learning experience.  Complaining won't really get you anywhere but if you reverse your thinking and view issues in a positive light, then greater opportunities will arise.    Furthermore, Cuban explains that success takes a lot of hard work and that business is 24/7, 365 days a year.  In order to succeed, you have to commit and work hard, and that there are no short cuts in life.  But the upside is that business is fun, it's pretty much a sport.  Just like in sports, you have to compete against your opponents to win.  He tells it like it is and that's what I appreciate most about this book.    Anyways, I truly enjoyed reading this book.  As a recent college graduate, I didn't really get the job that I wanted but I now view my work as a learning experience instead of just a job...  I highly recommend everyone to read this book.
B004VF68AQ|3.0|Listening to early Jane's Addiction was like going to the Asian jungle and encountering a wild Bengal tiger face to face amid the overgrown ruins of an ancient Indian temple.  It was dangerous, quasi-mystical and terrifying.  Jane's Addiction's latest CD is like watching an Animal Planet documentary about tigers on your big screen TV in your living-room.  Safe, kind of bland and smoothly produced.<br /><br />The phrase \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" has a whole new meaning here.  This album is about as adventurous and wild and groundbreaking as a trip to the local mall. There's none of the danger, urgency or depth anymore.  When I first heard Jane's Addiction in 1988, I imagined that I felt the way people felt hearing Elvis Presley for the first time in the 50s.  Nothing as incredibly bizarre and wild as this had ever been heard before.  (I'm not saying that JA sounds anything like Elvis.  Just illustrating the newness and 'unsafeness' of early JA.)<br /><br />Listening to Nothing's Shocking was almost a transgressive experience.  It felt kind of like you were doing something considered unsavory and a little depraved by the mainstream, but at the same time, extremely satisfying and fulfilling.  Ritual De Lo Habitual was a little more mainstream, but still unique and wild, free, mind-blowing and dangerous, and it contained the two best ever Jane's songs: 3 Days and Then She Did.  The last Jane's song that approached that wild free feeling was Hypersonic on 2003's Strays.<br /><br />The songs from The Great Escape Artist, however, can safely be included on a mix to listen to at the office with the latest Coldplay and U2 tunes.  They won't clash at all.  It's basically nice, clean, acceptable radio-friendly yuppie-rock.  Only Irresistible Force comes anywhere near the feeling of the early songs, but still falls far short of even Hypersonic.  I imagine the people who will enjoy this the most are younger listeners who are more comfortable with the safe, over-produced commercial pop and rock of the last decade.  Original Jane's Addiction fans from the 80s and 90s will be disappointed.  It's not that we are stuck in the past, just that we have memories and expectations of far more adventurous and creative music from this band.  To use a tired out cliche, Jane's Addiction has really 'sold out'.<br /><br />It's an OK album, very good if merely taken as a major label rock release of 2011, but alongside early Jane's Addiction it's sterile, soulless and 9/10ths dead inside.  I know Perry and Dave and Stephen are better off and happier and healthier as wealthy rock stars with supermodel wives than they were as edgy, half-crazed, slum-dwelling visionary junkies, but they sure made incredible music back then.  I miss it very much.ecade.  Original Jane's Addiction fans from the 80s and 90s will be disappointed.

1451627289|5.0|I finished 11/22/63 about two weeks ago and was extremely happy with my purchase and time well spent.  While I was listening to Glen Miller's \\"In the Mood\\" (a reoccurring reference throughout the novel) recently, it illuminated scenes and memories from a book that I feel as though has afflicted me with happiness and melancholy.  The love story that arises from the main character and a librarian in the past is evocative writing and the suspense that slowly builds throughout the novel boils to a dramatic conclusion.  With an ending that I appreciated very much so and with storytelling that is performed masterfully, I cannot recommend this novel enough.  There is a clear reason why this book has garnered 500+ positive reviews since its release last month -- 11/22/63 is a treat, a delight, and a novel that deserves your reading crave.
B00000DOZ6|5.0|Houses Of The Holy (1973) was Led Zeppelin's fifth studio album.  I really like this album's variety of songs and overall diversity.  I think this album is one of the band's best.  I rank it my fourth favorite studio album behind Physical Graffiti (1975), Led Zeppelin III (1970), and their untitled fourth album (1971).  I think Robert Plant was at the peak of his vocal powers on this album.<br /><br />The songs I find myself listening to the most on this album are \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", \\"The Crunge\\", and \\"No Quarter\\", which is one of my all time favorite Zeppelin tunes.  Overall, this is a 5-star album all the way.  This album overall is a little bit more on the lighter side and more upbeat compared to their previous albums.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album.
0307949486|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a fine example of fantastic and original storytelling.  The first half of the book more or less sets the back-story for what is to come throughout the trilogy.  This is important to keep in mind because although the extensiveness of Larsson's build-up may seem trite for the first book, it actually sets the stage for the two sequels.  If I had to pick my favorite aspect of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I would definitely select the setting.  Larsson's ability to describe such an idyllic vacation spot as a chilling retreat is especially remarkable.  Although Larsson's writing style may receive some criticism, it's important to recognize that this is a translation from Swedish, so the book may have lost a lot of its literary merit.  The book itself has been criticized for its slow plot and seemingly \\"predictable\\" outcome but I believe it's slow because it's building itself up for the entire trilogy and not only that, but the book's predictability to one person may not be predictable to another. Additionally, the novel also does a good job of addressing current world issues such as misogyny, feminism and feminist rights, as well as exposing the dark that is shrouded by our society's mantra, \\"out of sight, out of mind\\".  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a fine piece of literature and deserves a chance, even if it is slow to get going.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I enjoyed the soundtrack very much!  The songs were chosen appropriately for the movie that has touched my heart with the very first movie.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I purchased this through a retail chain about a week ago, and used it to sharpen up a few dull old pocket knives.  As another customer had mentioned before, it will sharpen the blade, but it puts a 40-45 degree edge on whatever you use it on. For hunting knives, combat knives, or anything with a similar edge, this will produce mediocre results at best. Depending on what you use the knife for, you may want to consider shooting for an angle closer to 30 degrees for such blades.<br /><br />If you want a decent tool to sharpen a cheaper knife, this will do the job. But if you're expecting to put an edge on any quality knife, you'll be best off with a whetstone.

B0051C5CSC|4.0|Ive owned several Animal versions through the years. This is the 2011 Remaster. Not a plastic case. Has Japanese notes and info. Im not sure why this was more expensive, i was thinking it would be of higher quality but really is no different than the U.S version of the 2011 remaster. I guess because it's imported it's more money. Still it's Animals, so I wont complain.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Daft Punk is awesome!  They couldn't have done a better job with this soundtrack.  It totally fits the movie and sounds amazing.
1594744769|4.0|Well, I debated on whether to give this a 3 star or a 4 star, but since the GoodReads rating says 4 Stars is \\"I really liked it,\\" I'll go with that because I really liked the concept of taking the old/odd eccentric photographs and weaving a story around them. Brilliant! And very well integrated.<br /><br />I confess about halfway through, when my daughter snatched the book out from under me and I had to wait a few days, I started reading other reviews...and they got me a little worried, saying the story collapsed or fell flat about 2/3 of the way through.<br /><br />I couldn't disagree more.<br /><br />While the way the story ended was anticlimactic to me, I think the last 1/3 of the book had really good movement with a new plot point. That's really the key, I think--approach this book, not as a whole, but as two parts. In doing so, you'll find a ramping up at the introduction (of both parts) a great middle, and a decent ending (at least on the first half). At the end, we were introduced to some interesting new creatures, and I was a little disappointed this wasn't more fully explored, but rather felt like a rushed introduction/explanation/conclusion in the last third. Otherwise, I'd have to say this story has a sagging middle that nearly deceived me into laying it down. That is where this book might lose its readers. However, if one pushes on and enjoys the story and its world and loops, you'll soon find yourself captured again in a fantastical story.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed the world that Riggs created and his unique characters.
B004M20YDU|5.0|Great addition to the regular soundtrack!  Awesome to work-out to.  Thanks Daft Punk!  You guys are so talented. Movie is not too bad either!

B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is a GREAT watch for any runner no matter what skill level. The controls are somewhat easy to figure out if u read the manual. The connecting to the computer part is a little bit confusing and difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it gets easier(just try a few times). Took it on one run and gave very accurate times and paces. REVIEW: good watch, but could be a little bit easier to use.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Any time a Criterion Collection edition of a DVD comes out, it is usually worth the few extra bucks it will cost you.<br /><br />This presentation of \\"Seven Samurai\\" is fantastic.

B004JN1CW4|5.0|I am a big fan of the Maze Runner Trilogy, and even though some parts of the book were a bit anti-climactic, my overall rating is 5 stars. Dashner has created some amzine characters and he has a very good plot. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure.
0525423656|3.0|After they came and took Ky away, Cassia wasn't sure what the future held, but she knew she had to find him. Now she's been working in the outer Provinces for months in hopes of somehow finding a way to connect with him. Fearful that she's running out of time before she must return to her work assignment in the Society, Cassia sneaks onto an airship transporting workers to a village in the border provinces. Once there, she hears word that someone who fits Ky's description has recently been in the area. Along with Indie, her one friend from the work camps, Cassia plans an escape and embarks on a journey to find Ky and with any luck, others who want to rebel against the Society as well. While she searches for Ky and the Rising, Cassia must stay alive, avoid capture or discovery and decide where an with whom her future lies.   Now that Cassia has ventured away from her comfortable life in the Society, the sterile and pristine world we were introduced to in Matched has been replaced by rugged wilderness and harsh terrain giving Crossed a very different feel than the first book in the series. Along with the Society, Cassia's family, and to an extent Xander have also disappeared from this second installment. I found myself missing the characters from the first novel, but did enjoy the new characters that were introduced in book 2.   Each chapter in Crossed switches back in forth between Cassia and Ky's points of view. While I enjoyed getting to better know Ky in this manner, I found the flip-flopping confusing at times and often had to check back to see who was speaking. While the story isn't quite as gripping as Matched, Crossed does set up the next book in the series wonderfully. I'm eager to see how things work out in book 3!   An enjoyable read, Crossed felt a little more like a bridge between the fist and third books in the series rather than a complete novel on its own. Fans of Matched will want to read this one, but don't expect the same book you read in the firstinstallment in the trilogy.

B006INDMEE|5.0|The Debt is one of those rare films that depicts covert operations in both a believable and exciting manner. There is little if any need to suspend disbelief. The film portrays the emotional and physical tolls paid by a small group of Israeli operatives during (and following) a European mission. The acting is outstanding, the story is entertaining, and the subject matter is serious. If you enjoy relatively realistic spy thrillers like Body of Lies and Munich, then you will love the Debt. Though it is serious and realistic, it also has a good amount of action.

B005EHNEDO|5.0|The Whole Love represents a band that now fully understands how to use the considerable talents of each member to record an album that is greater than the sum of the parts. Sky Blue Sky and Wilco (The Album) were a band learning how to take advantage of each other's strengths.  The Whole Love is the current lineup's [[ASIN:B00005YXZH Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]. Art Of Almost opens the album brilliantly, telling the listener to reset their expectations. I Might, Dawned On Me, Born Alone, Capitol City, and Whole Love are classic Wilco rock songs. Mixed in are Sunloathe, Black Moon, Open Mind, and Rising Red Lung that change the pace of the album and are melodic classics. The album closes with One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley's Boyfriend) that is in the discussion for Wilco's greatest song ever. You don't realize the song is 12 minutes long unless you're looking at a clock. The guitar melody and piano accompaniment work perfectly together with Tweedy's Dylanesque songwriting. I think this song's brilliance is how the piano accompaniment has subtle changes each time around.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|If you want to see Anne Hathaway literally turned into road kill, watch this movie.<br />If you want to watch a slow moving sad movie, watch this movie.<br />If you want to want to see a bunch of bland unbelievable acting, watch this movie.<br />If you want to watch a movie where the character you WISH was turned into road kill escapes, watch this movie.<br /><br />This movie is NOT a \\"hidden gem\\" it is not even an acceptable way to \\"pass the time\\".  Take a nap.  It would be more entertaining fun.
0385534639|3.0|I had read so many reviews about this book that I thought it a crime not to read it. So, I picked up a copy and dove in... as the title of this review stats, it's a superb letdown.<br /><br />The premise is quite magical, but the characters are dry and thus, the plot moves along slowly. With a book this long you expect much to happen; alas, it does not. The ending is trite, but mostly, I just feel like the entire show is one person.<br /><br />The reason being: Every bit of conversation is the same. Not verbatim, but style. No character has their own method of speech as in real life, which takes away all semblance of realism to this book. If you covered up the names of who was speaking, you wouldn't know who was who.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book is a poor representation of a grand idea.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic puzzle game with impressing presentation and polish.  The puzzles are tricky, often with an &quot;obvious&quot; solution that's one step too many, and a completely different solution for the Perfect.  Can't wait until Reflect is available for Android!
B002WJI65S|5.0|This is the coolest little plush I've ever seen!  It's very soft, it seems very durable, and the feet have extra weight so if you try, you can get it to stand upright without any support (though the slightest disturbance would make it fall).  It's the perfect size: small enough that you could hold it with one hand, but big enough that you could hold it with two.  The felt eyebrows give it the perfect expression.  From this point forward, I will avoid jumping on Goombas in Mario games when at all possible, because I couldn't imagine squishing this guy! D:
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I love this set, and the price. At other retailers I have seen this price listed at $140.00 which for this set is completely ridiculous since it has no real special features. But for someone like me who doesn't really care about the extras and just wants the films this is perfect.

1419702238|5.0|I had just about given up on this series.  I loved books one and two. Book three was ok, but books four and five just didn't live up to the first two. It was almost as though Kinney was writing the books only so as not to disappoint his millions of young fans.  I had also read somewhere that book five was to be the last in the series, so I was rather surprised when the announcement came about book six.  Fortunately for me, I am a school librarian and my students love this series. Therefore I had to read Cabin Fever in order to stay current with my students.  I'm glad I did, because this book reignited my love for the series.<br /><br />What I liked about the book: Greg is less whiny in this book. Oh, sure - he's still the King of Bad Choices, but he actually seems to grow a little, in spite of himself.  That was my problem with books  four and five - Greg seemed rather stagnant.  I like that the book is a quick, easy and entertaining read.  Kinney certainly knows his audience and does a great job of meeting their expectations.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book: Can't think of anything I didn't like.<br /><br />As I mentioned my students (3rd - 5th grade) are crazy about this series.  Our pre-winter break library lesson involved a book talk about Cabin Fever and then they had an indoor snowball fight. They each wrote an adjective about snow on three slips of paper, balled them up and spent 60 seconds having a snowball fight. At the end of the fight they took three \\"snowballs\\" that had landed near them and used the three words to write a poem about snow on their blog.  They had a great time.  I'm not sure which they enjoyed more - the excerpt I read from the book or the snowball fight.<br /><br />AR Reading level: 5.8<br /><br />Recommended for 3rd grade and up.<br /><br />Mrs. Archer's rating: 5 of 5!
B005VR9328|5.0|The Roots went a step further in this album by not only touching on how South Hip-Hop has gone, but ending the album with instrumentals so deep, Spike Lee would shed a couple of tears. For those of you who don't appreciate reviews such as this like the Yelawolf Radioactive review, get lost. For those of you who appreciate a concise review, especially if you are an authentic fan of this group, get the album. It's somewhat of a sequel to How I Got Over. Period!!

0385493622|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you love math and if you love history - you will love this book. I derived a lot of inspiration from this. This is a story that talks about the astounding capabilities of the human brain. I am particularly inspired by the resolve of Prof. Andrew Wiles (Who ultimately proves Fermat's Last theorem).  Not only that, Fermat (who was a prolific mathematician) was a full time judge and only a part-time mathematician. This basically reminded me of how the youngsters (including myself) of this generation are wasting their precious time in worthless activities like watching tv, fb and all the other nonsense. From this book, I have understood that anything could be achieved (in the outside world) only by sheer striving.   I am planning to present this to all my cousins who are in schools / colleges. Though this is a popular science book, there is no compromise on the rigor and that's one of the reasons why I liked this. A must read for people in Engineering/Science/Math research.   P.S.:  Do watch the BBC documentary (titled fermat's last theorem) by the same author available on youtube before you buy this book.
0395389496|5.0|My son loves the movie and the book was a hit as well.  The little ornament that came with it and the Audio CD were great added bonuses.  We almost picked up the book only somewhere else for twice the price!
0345529057|5.0|LOVE IT! If you like reading and are looking forward to be gripped by an amazing story, then this is the correct place for you.  The books are incredible plus this edition rocks!
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Not a good deal.Too expensive for a plastic cover that does not even provide support for viewing in a vertical position.  Tends to collapse in use.  It does offer excellent protection for the Kindle when closed.
B0012Q732O|2.0|I went to this movie expecting it to be a fantasy; therefore, I suspended my logic. I just wanted to enjoy the special effects. They turned out to be a mixed bag. They are riveting, and look real in the scenes where the doldos (giant birds) chase and kill the men. The mastodons look impressive and convincing too. However the saber-toothed tiger look obviously fake. The ending scenes where the pyramid was being built are one of the most spectacular I ever seen. It looks huge, lively and beautiful.<br /><br />The plot is an exact copy of Apocalypto. Yet this film does not have the suspense and intensity of Apocalypto. The acting is not convincing either. At the end, a few people laughed when the female character was resurrected from her death but I didn't mind. I had already expected it to be a fantasy.<br /><br />Overall, it's worth watching once for curiosity. Everybody who likes dinosaurs will certainly wants to see this picture. As for me, after seeing this, I pulled out the DVD copies of \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" from BBC and viewed them. They look real and much more interesting
B0042MDAL8|4.0|Eclipse was my favorite of the 4 books in the saga, but the movie is my least favorite of the films.  Maybe it's that the director on New Moon did such a great job and the soundtrack was phenomenal - but this film just fell flat.  Its saving grace was being able to look at Robert Pattinson.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|whats there to say that hasnt been said about this lp its just one of those albums u just play and listen to from start to finish  without any dissapointments!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|If you guys gave this a less than 5 star, shame on you, you have no appreciation for classic Disney movies. If there is something wrong with your Blu-ray player, don't blame Disney, blame your Blu-ray player.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything worked just fine (on my kindle fire) till I went full screen. I had it on radar which was working perfect, and then I changed it to satellite and it locked up tight. Wouldn't power down or sleep. Finally I just held the power button in for about fifteen seconds and it powered down. enough for me. UPDATE:3/14/12 Way too early on the review! Never have reason for the satellite view. I use this app at least once a day and sometimes more. \\"Recommendation--Very good app, and do your homework before you write a review, (UNLIKE ME!)\\"
B004259BMM|5.0|Not my favorite CD of his..but still amazing! I love Keith Urban...if you ever have a chance to go see him live do it! He is the best performer I have ever seen. :)
B002VPE1AW|5.0|So far, in 2011, it is still the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />I watched this in the theatre and in my relative's home on a 3D TV 3 days ago. Both times, I was glued to the chair. My words can not describe the beauty of the landscape, the animals, and the forest. It still amazes me after watching this film twice. No wonder it got an Oscar in 2010 for Art Direction.<br /><br />In terms of character development and plot, there is nothing new. However, that does not affect its charm. It deserves 5 stars.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I loved all of the characters. I actually read the book in 1 day and then completely re-read it the very next day. I liked this book even more than the Twilight series, not just because of the way McGuire writes, but because it is intended for adults and not teenagers. There are sexual situations, drinking, and cursing so it's more fun!! If I could give it 10 stars I would!
1423117166|5.0|Absolutely amazing. This is a book on character art and animation. As another comment has mentioned, it is full of expressions and you are able to share the emotions of the characters within the pages. There are some in portions of sequences and there are some that act as a stand alone, but either way if you are an animator or even just a Disney enthusiast, you will enjoy this book immensely. I love these artists and highly respect the quality of their work. I highly recommend this book!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|this is a great music app but, with the latest update it has a flaw now. it will allow to put on sd card but when I do that it force closes constantly. however I have enough space on my phone so I won't worry about it till you can get it fixed thank you
B0043URV5U|3.0|What is here is terrific (and needs to be in chronological order), but this is mainly a rehash of the 2 Greatest Hits CDs that were previously released.  What's the point?  There is way too much that isn't here -- where is Heavy Music, 2+2, Lookin Back, Lucifer, Living Inside My Heart (from About Last Night), Understanding...  well you get the point.  Little Drummer Boy???????????  Guess this is ok for the new casual fan, but better to get the 2 GH albums.  More than any other artist, Bob needs a 4-disc Anthology in chronological order.  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I have been a fan of Pearl Jam (especially Eddie) from the beginning. Eddie Vedder is a gem in our culture. He brings sincerity, raw emotion and tranquility to his music. No matter what mood I am in, Eddie Vedder always puts me in a calm and relaxed state of mind. I love this CD! Eddie can not do wrong.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I watched this in the theatre and just now on DVD. I tremendously enjoyed it both times.  The dialogue is funny in some scenes. For example, in the motel, Grover held up Medusa's head and said...  The special effects are life like. The snakes on Medusa's head look scary and real. They are much better than the ones in Clash of The Titans 2010.  In short, it's entertaining. It deserves 4 stars.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I could not be more pleased with my case for my new Kindle Fire!  The cover is beautiful and looks and feels like an old leather-bound book.  I was initially concerned that the straps were too small for my Kindle but was able to easily secure it in place and it is definitely secure!  I've noticed no sound-loss whatsoever from the straps.  I love how the cover makes my Kindle feel and hold like a book (the cover will even fold back on itself, but as with any book that you hold like that, it doesn't want to close all the way when you do until you lay it on that side of the cover for a bit).<br /><br />No complaints whatsoever, I'm even thinking about taking it to a local bookstore and getting my name embossed in gold in it to really finish off the classic look of a great book.
B003L77G8I|4.0|Enjoyed the show. I was able to see episodes that I had not seen. Really liked being able to see episodes more than once.

B005K2YTG4|5.0|The cover, pouch is perfect for holding  my Kindle.  It is very well make and attractive.   I just bought another for my husband.
B000X107GI|5.0|I bought these to replace the coin battery in my pedometer. The batteries came a day early and it looks like they work. I know pedometers don't use much energy, so my using one won't hold much weight, but after a month the battery I used is still going. In case anyone is curious, I bought mine from MYBATTERYSUPPLIER.<br />Great price and they work. I have no complaints and would by again in the future.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I waited all year for this dvd to join my collection.  I thought it was a great way to end the series and love that they stayed true to the ending of the book.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Everything about this concert casts a spell.  The lighting is so warm that every instrument and face and fabric seems rich beyond probability.  The camera closes in on each with an intimacy I've never experienced in a filmed concert, from the musicians, who play some instruments new to me, to the beautiful blend of the voices, both Cohen's and his three female backup singers.  It's unusual to see a singer/songwriter still performing at this age, which must be over 80, but his voice has aged like good wine.  I understand that when he went into a monastery a few years back, his agent ran off with all his money.  True or not, we are beholden that Cohen is still singing.  And he is clearly delighted to be before a full, enthusiastic house, most of whom seem to be several generations his junior.  (At one point, he refers to something that happened when he was 60 --\\"just a crazy kid with a dream.\\")  If you're a longtime fan, all of your favorites are sung here -- plus some recent you may not have heard; Cohen is ever-evolving.  The concert, like the camera, takes its time, and they're brought back for many, many encores. This DVD includes the lyrics to most of the songs, which is a boon when you find yourself singing them for days afterwards.  The first of Cohen's songs I remember hearing was \\"Suzanne\\", and I'm most grateful that I now have the lyrics to refer to. For me, the man is first and foremost a poet, but the melodies are enchanting, and you would never mistake any of them for anyone else's.
0439023521|3.0|Everyone keeps saying this is a rip off of Battle Royal. I think they are both rip offs of Survivor by Walter F. Moudy. It is a short story set in the future where countries fight but instead of WAR, each party would gather up their best 100 soldiers and put them in an arena to fight. The last side to have any survivors would be granted immunity in their country and would be able to do anything they wanted as compensation for their term. The country would recieve \\"spoils\\" money, food, oil, from the losers.  Very Familier sounding idea eh?!
0689835604|5.0|I love this book so much, that I want to buy all of Karen Katz books!! This is a Perfect compliment to the baby you can read seriers!!! My God, those 2 people must of gotten together to put together such projects!! Colorful, Bright, it is just perfect! I'm so excited when we read this book more then he is I think lol.  But, the only thing is, yeap, watch out for those flaps.  I'm debating about buying all of her books used - but I'm not sure, because I WOULD WANT ALL MY FLAPS TO TO BE IN PLACE.  Babies rip and tear things - THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT..  So, flap books use only be used with parents supervison, or you will have torn flaps.  My 18 month old has not worn the flaps yet, but I have no doubt that one day he may, if unsupervised.  EXCELLENT READ - I've also ordered it in Spanish, since I'm teaching baby Spanish as well.  Excellent for learning English/Spanish - as one other reviewer said as well!
0307949486|4.0|I received this book for my birthday from my fiance, mainly because of my excitement about the upcoming film and the fact I had been expressing interest in reading some fiction.  This is the first fiction book I have read since \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\", I read about maybe 1-2 fiction books a year the rest of time is spent reading non-fiction.  I've never really read a criminal/thriller novel.  But I must say I was intrigued by the book and I had a hard time putting it down.  Considering the book was about 590 pages I got it done in about 5 intervals of reading.  It's a good read, is it a great literary classic, No but then again I haven't read that much fiction. There are a substantial amount of characters and I did have a hard time keeping up with them. I plan to read the rest of the series, hopefully they will go into more detail about the Lisbeth character.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|This is a wonderful book, well written, and very difficult to read. It is difficult to read because the author concentrates on all the negatives, the failures, the negative attributes, actions, some small and some large, that the main characters have and do. The characters are not monsters, they are just too human: kind one second, nasty and selfish the next hour. It is their human traits, the ones that I identified with over and over again, that made the difficult, after all no one wants to be reminded of their failures while trying to relax.  It is well worth the pain.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|This is a great DVD.  It some of the best performances from the Live 8 performances.  My only complaint is that people expected great sound quality will not be satisfied.  There are better concert DVDs from each of these artists, but this is a great snapshot of dozens of acts that you may have not heard of.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Just got this, and it is a wonderful soundtrack.  There was a couple songs I was hoping was on there that wasn't, but all in all very good.  I would buy it again.
B005NK69ZC|1.0|I am a huge Ellen fan and watch her show everyday.  I was expecting a lot more from this book, glad I didn't actually purchase it!  What a mess, couldn't even finish it.
0439023521|5.0|I've been hearing about The Hunger Games for a few years now. Fellow friends and readers have urged me on several occasions to pick up the book, the whole trilogy in fact. Two things put me off the idea. The first was the fact the the novels are considered \\"Young Adult.\\"  As a fairly well-read individual of many genres, with plenty of classic and modern literature under my belt - I had trouble visualizing myself reading a book written for children.  Secondly, when friends tried to describe the plot to me, it just didn't make a whole lot of sense.  After reading it, I see why. The plot is difficult to describe to those uninitiated to the captivating world of Panem. When I heard they were adapting the novels to film I thought, \\"Fine! Let's see what all this commotion is about!\\"  It was a great decision. For those of you with doubts similar to those I harbored, allow me to put your mind at ease.    The Hunger Games, and the entire trilogy are really NOT young adult novels.  The only reason I can find for this classification (and I've given this much thought) is that the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen - is sixteen years old when the series begins.  The story is written from her point of view, but with the highest level of style and imagery.  There is nothing juvenile or simplified about the plot, or the writing.  In fact, the diction is every bit as solid as that of Stephen King or any number of bestselling authors whose novels rest comfortably a few rows away from the YA section. The tone of the novel is grim and candid, no punches are pulled as Collins expertly describes a brutal, violent and dark dystopian future.  If the concept of a \\"dystopian future\\" wrinkles your brow - worry not.  No one wants to read another knock off of 1984, and there are dozens.  Beneath veneer of a world gone wrong lies an emotional torrent of hope and bravery that breaks through to the reader in every page.  However, the world of Panem is a violent place, and the plot - which very simply put - consists of children between the ages of 12 and 18 being placed into vast arenas and forced to murder one another with any available means.  Again, this is not a book for children.    But of course, the story goes much farther than that - and the trilogy as a whole has a thoughtful and original plot that leads the reader into deeper places than the lip-biting thrills of the games themselves.  Many reviews have been written with greater detail in regards to the plot, and I don't want to spoil even the smallest twists for the would-be reader.    The point is this; if you feel disinclined to read a YA novel, throw your inhibitions away and go for it, you will not be disappointed by the adult quality of writing and the very adult content of the plot.
B000002KDX|5.0|Love these old songs. Puts me in a good mood and brings back so many memories. These songs are wonderful with great lyrics and played so very well by the group , America.
B0060LYM34|5.0|The movie you buy is Armageddon, the problem was fixed!!! It looks great on the Fire and is well worth buying!
B000056TKD|5.0|When I listened to this for the first time, I couldn't believe how many of Holst's pieces had been stolen and ruined by advertisers the world over.<br /><br />It is brilliant music, powerfully written and performed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD.
0553296981|5.0|My daughter is enjoying the book as she has enjoyed eveything else I have ordered.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Game play is just like on the computer. Excellent play on the fire. Clear screen. Ads a pain but keeps the price down.
B000004756|5.0|I was absolutely blown away by this performance. The three of the guitarists perform live and you are hearing blazing fingers, riffs and interplay as it happens. It's just fantastic.  Melodic, passionate and impressive.  I highly recommend this CD for music lovers, or for guitarists looking to diversify their ears. :-)
B00650SSWG|5.0|I kind of felt like I was watching skinamax when we started watching this movie but once you get into it, it is a really cute, funny and relatable story. I liked it a lot more than I initially thought I would and look forward to watching it again and catching the details I always miss the first time around.
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|Terence Malick's &#34;The Tree of Life&#34;  is about as good as it gets in terms of an American film with avant-garde qualities destined for wide distribution.  And so I can understand why it won the Palme D'Or because it was a wholly American picture that simultaneously transcends that very category by way of its universal appeal.  Generally the cinematography is stunning--This is a great film to look at--Whatever one ends up thinking about the content.  A number of themes are juxtaposed resulting in a picture that wants to have it both ways--IE &#34;Life is beautiful and mysterious and we're all connected&#34;--Yet concurrently--&#34;You'd better be tough, strong and Machiavellian or you're not going to make it in this world--Nice guys finish last&#34;.  Or: &#34;There is so much beauty in this world.  Therefore one has no excuse not to make something of themselves.&#34;  In the process the film goes back in time in its exploration of Darwinian themes--IE a scene featuring a wounded, bleeding dinosaur at the edge of the beach while hammerhead sharks hover nearby; elucidating the fact that in nature the weaker creatures are left behind to die; the more fragile among us are more likely not to survive.  Secondly--God is a legitimate force in the lives of this 1950s Texan family that is the focus of this picture.  In one scene--Mrs. O'Brien points to the sky and tells her son &#34;That's where God lives&#34;.  The world of the dinosaurs is destroyed by a comet--God decides to take back what he has created.  Just as God decides to take back Mrs. O'Brien's son.  By having faith one can justify the irrationality of Nature.  Similarly, Mr. O'Brien's tough-love / borderline abuse of his son Jack is also justified by this film.  Which works in the end because although tormented, the older Jack (Sean Penn) ends up being what appears to be a very successful architect with all the accoutrements of success--Jack is truly his father's son.<br /><br />Highlights of &#34;The Tree of Life&#34; include the state-of-the-art / influenced by &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34; visuals--They do lend credence to the way this film explores age-old philosophical and spiritual questions.  Whereas &#34;2001&#34; is cold, bleak and sinister--&#34;Tree of Life&#34; tells the viewer that we're all in this together.  For almost all of the picture I was drawn in by Malick's vision--The coming of age story; the superbly created cosmic visuals accentuating the process of mourning and the resulting contemplation of the universe and the meaning of it all.  But then near the end of the film comes a sequence featuring many people wandering around on the beach.  While I found some of it to be moving--It was also the weakest section of the picture.  Here I could see influences from Fellini's &#34;8 1/2&#34; and &#34;La Dolce Vita&#34;--Groups of people near the ocean in awe of the mystery of life.  But in the end, this sequence made me recall the &#34;I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing&#34; Coca Cola commercials from circa 40 years ago.  In this &#34;Magical Mystery Beach Scene&#34;--Even the boy with the burned scalp (representing the Misfit / Outcast) who is viewed with suspicion by the neighborhood boys for his &#34;difference&#34;--Will be loved--If only by his mother.  Because again--&#34;We're all in this together&#34;--And so compassion is possible.  Regardless of its ever-changing hues--This film is ultimately hopeful.<br /><br />Stephen C. Bird, Author of &#34;Any Resemblance To A Coincidence Is Accidental&#34;34; include the state-of-the-art / influenced by &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34; visuals--They do lend credence to the way this film explores age-old philosophical and spiritual questions.

B006ANJ4BW|5.0|This version was completely different and that is what I was hoping for.  I didn't want to relive the Schwarzenegger film I wanted something new.  The young Conan did an excellent job.  Jason Momoa is a great actor and really played the role of a Barbarian.    I have enjoyed his talents in Stargate Atlantis and was pleasantly surprised to see him in Conan
B004EPYZOO|5.0|i hate to coin a phrase but, This movie is a \\"must have\\" for all of you Nick Cage fans out there.<br />The storyline is creative and, in some twisted way, plausable and inspiring.<br />We all wish we could be the super-hero-anti-villain character (portrayed by Cage)with the roots of our checkered past serving as the foundation for our ruthlessness, all the while being inspired to protect the innocent by reflecting on the loss of our own.<br />The acting, the directing AND the storyline are all top notch !!<br /><br />i've said enough without giving anything away...See the movie, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />XXX<br />Matthew

I do like all the characters and the thought of a disease raging through the entire population. The end didn't live up to what I was hoping for. Maybe I put added pressure on it because it is a trilogy.     5) Final recommendation: I did like this book and the whole trilogy. Well worth the read.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|This one is for the pilot who is looking for an inexpensive GPS alternative.     I purchased this GPS along with Approach Systems software [...]. The GPS works flawlessly with the moving map in the air. We took a flight from Long Beach to Catalina to test the unit out on my 10.1\\" netbook. Our altitude readout and heading was spot on (as compared with the aircraft instruments). The unit acquires satellites really fast and signal is strong. Please be advised that I am using this device for a little extra awareness during VISUAL (VFR) flights and that is all it should be used for. This is not a super advanced $600 Garmin.     For the price it is unbelieveable. I am flying to Vegas for the first time this weekend and I am taking this unit with me. Try it out, you might just love it :)
0446573019|3.0|This was the first time I had ever read a novel by David Baldacci.  To say I was dissapointed is an understatement.  It was so similiar to the Reacher character in Lee Childs' novels I was surprised it was even published.  Puller pales in comparison to Reacher.  It's like he's a Reacher wanna-be.  This just may have been my first and last Baldacci.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|An interesting premise, full of possibility, turns into a very, very slow paced story of one man's mission into the past and a major complication that he discovers there.  I am reluctant to say that this would have been a great 30 minute Twilight Zone episode, so I'll be generous and say it's a good 60 minute Twilight Zone episode.  This isn't the Stephen King that I loved from years past.  He's different this time around, more concerned with theorycrafting over action and minutiae to a point irrelevant to the character's journey.  It shows that King did his homework on Oswald's world before JFK's assassination, but at the cost of hundreds of pages that just didn't need to be there.  It would have been a great short story.  As a long one, it's not.

6304711905|4.0|The quality was very good, but the format was widescreen, which I don't particularly care for.  When I purchased this DVD, I don't recall reading anything referencing the format.  The service was great as usual.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|Bought this product new because other reviewers recommended it;  sound quality is as advertised-- but the earphones are shoddily made and the cushioned ear pads detached within a month of regular use.  The third-party seller, Adorama, would not accept return/exchange.

Sure they smell like chemicals RIGHT when you take them out of their packaging but... it's brand new, it's going to have a BRAND new smell to it. It eventually dissipates, just like any other product that comes with a \\"new car\\" smell.   The sleeve itself is very well made. These comments where they say it is dollar store quality do not know what they are talking about. What are you expecting; cashmere, silk.... tank armor? The fabric used for this sleeve is of top quality. And, I cannot get over how classy the faux leather band with engraved Kindle logo looks set to match the fabric of the sleeve. Honestly, this is one of the best looking cases/sleeves on the market.  The Kindle does fit very snug in the sleeve, but it is absolutely prefect for every day use or travel and will protect your Kindle Fire from most mishaps. Don't buy this thinking its going to protect your Kindle Fire from a 50 foot drop... that is NOT what this is designed for and those who are reviewing this product acting like it should... please get real. The internal egg carton cushion design is more than enough to protect your Kindle Fire from normal abuse. Just don't go tossing off the Grand Canyon and you should be fine (though I can't say that any of the sleeves or cases currently on the market would honestly protect it from such events either.... unless you're going to go dip it in Kryptonite, of course.)  Overall this is a VERY well made, VERY classy sleeve. I ended up ordering three of the color schemes and each one is amazing. I highly recommend this sleeve to anyone who owns a Kindle Fire.
0756405890|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a while. It's genuinely imaginative, wonderfully written, and a fascinating story. I highly recommend this book for any reader of fiction, be it fantasy or otherwise.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Lately Megadeth has made some great music. This new Cd is a continuation of the End Game except with the return of Dave Ellefson on bass. Songs have a lot of complex structures, tons of solos and catchy tunes like the song \\"Public Enemy\\". I recommend the CD to all old thrash fans, old school Megadeth fans and any fan of Metal music.
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|I guess this movie was just to far over my head.  I get the story, just wondered why it took so long to get there.  However, it was worth watching just for the beautiful scenes in it.  I watched it on my Lap Top which has a Blu-ray player and again on our television (sans Blu-ray).  This film has made me start looking for an HD TV and a Blu-Ray dvd player!!  Awesome..and the music was beautiful as well.  To me, the story could have as easily be left off.  Couldn't decide whether to like or hate the father!!
0375413405|2.0|I bought this cookbook to give my mom for Christmas, as we'd both watched \\"Julie & Julia\\" multiple times and loved it. As a full time college student working part time for minimum wage, it was a bit of a splurge for me. Unfortunately, the copy I received has dirt-colored smudges all over the front of the paper jacket. It's really disappointing, as I don't have time to return it and get a new one (and what if the new one was dirty as well?), so I'm going to have to give my mom a besmudged cookbook for Christmas. I'm really frustrated by this.

B004LROUNG|4.0|I listened to this book via Audible.com in the unabridged edition and really enjoyed it. It reminded me of the &#34;old&#34; John Grisham from the days of the The Firm etc. Totally mismatched characters from opposite ends of the lawyer universe - a group of folks that should never be together and yet Grisham makes it work. Wish we had seen more of the secretary, but that is my only complaint really. There was plenty of humor which is always welcome in any book. Loved the firm dog, AC!

1451627289|4.0|Like many, I enjoyed reading this book.  King is such a great storyteller and seems to have done a good job on researching Kennedy's assassination.  However, I kept getting distracted in the details of Texas and was surprised that he did not have a better job done on the research.  Here are a few things I noticed.  Fort Worth is about 300 miles from the Permian Basin and you can never smell the petroleum from that distance.  When you drive to Midland, you notice the smell, but not anywhere near Fort Worth.  When you drove east from Dallas before Interstate 20, you drove on Highway 80 not Highway 20.  It helped the storyline, but when Bobbi Jill's face was cut they took her to Parkland, because no hospital was closer.  Jodie is described as being near Killeen.  Temple, thirty miles from Killeen is home to Scott and White Hospital, which would have been the obvious choice.  In addition, his descriptions of Greenville Ave during this time seem more in line with Deep Ellum.  I was surprised that he didn't have someone do the research on these details he used.
0385738773|5.0|i couldnt believe what happened in this book. People like  Teresa and Newt dying in the end, it stung me like  a dagger to a heart. I'm, glad that Thomas stayed with   Brenda they both loved each other and stayed committed to  help eachother to the very end. I hope the author decides to make a part two series for this book.
B006BOT28U|5.0|It's Not Luck is a sequel to Eli's first book \\"The Goal\\", and follows the same basic strategy, following the career of the protagonist, Rogu, teaching us along the way the thinking and business principals that Eli sees as key.  I really enjoyed the book.  Teaching through parables and stories is a great technique, and well followed in this book.  The big idea being communicated was a process for thinking carefully and deeply about problems.  In looking through this, we see it being applied primarily in a business context, and additionally in the personal life of Rogu.  The different scenarios presented help us to see how general an approach it is, and that it is something that we can apply to al areas of our lives.  In looking at the business applications we also see some of the principles of how Eli would run a company.  In particular I found the following summary of  business goals very helpful:  Make Money now as well as in the future,  Provide a secure and satisfying environment for employees now as well as in the future, and  Provide satisfaction to the market now as well as in the future.  These three goals give a business that thrives both now and is sustainable.  The goals ensure that the company is profitable, that employees are happy, and that customers are being served.  All of which are required to ensure that the company works well now and it is being done in a sustainable way.  While I found this succinct description of goals for a company helpful, the key of the book is the thinking process presented within. I highly recommend you go and read \\"It's Not Luck\\", you'll learn and have fun while doing so.

1401309666|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who want to understad E-commerce.  It is very important for any small business person.  It is also great for young people to understand the environment we live in today and how you get things done. Excellent summary and overview.  The only negative is that it appears to have been written a few years ago and needs to be updated. They refer to companies that are no longer in business because they have been acquired.  Eg. Sun Micro which is now part of Oracle.

B003PBB4ME|1.0|The X-Grip has two knobs on it: a short screw knob on the upper arm to tighten the upper shoe, and a long screw knob underneath the base to secure the camera. The one on the base is supposed to have been drilled with a 1/4\\" hole in order for you to mount the X-Grip on a tripod.   However, their factory drilled the 1/4\\" tripod hole in the wrong knob: the shoe tightener. Since the screws are of different lengths, they're not interchangeable.  It makes the unit far less flexible. Picture this: I'm out in the field, shooting with the X-Grip, with my video monitor, XLR adapter box, and camera mounted to it. I take my freeform action shots. Now I want to change to a tripod shot. If the hole was drilled properly, I could just attach the X-Grip directly to the tripod. Without that 1/4\\" hole, now I have to detach everything from the X-grip and remount it on the tripod.   This is apparently an ongoing issue with this product, as more than one reviewer has mentioned it as far back as September. I hoped they would have fixed their stock. Obviously, it still has not been corrected.  Yes, I can return it. But if I replace it with another one, how do I know if THAT one won't have the same issue? All I want is that one part, properly manufactured.  I emailed Opteka several times in November, asking if they could just send me that single knob. I think it's ridiculous to have to spend all this money and effort on postage, packaging, and handling to exchange the unit, when all they would need to do is mail a $1 part with $1 of postage.   I received no response. I finally posted it on their Facebook page. I received a response from an M. Coleman. I emailed him that day, on Nov. 25, 2011. It's now mid-December, and I have received neither a part nor a reply.   So - that's two stars off for a defective product. Minus another two starts for horrible customer service. And I'm just going to return the unit and get my money back. Thanks for nothing, Opteka.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this for about a week now, on my Cruz T301, with satisfactory results.  I'm also pleased that it includes a countdown timer.  I like the included ringtones, especially \\"Medieval Jaunt\\" which I've been using as my wake-up alarm.  This app includes a fade-in, so if you don't like being startled awake, it's worth looking into.

B005F6NA56|3.0|Leslie Feist's third is about open spaces - spare, crackling guitar, dry vocals, and exposed nerves.  There's no \\"1234\\" here (Feist's 2007 smash that got picked up for an Apple commercial) to bounce you to the pop clouds.  Everything about Metals is basic, much of it evincing an early-demo quality.  Feist's enunciation is sloppy, inviting misconstrued lyrics, and with liner notes done in a curly, squared font, in a single block of run-on print -- titles, lyrics, and credits, it's as if Feist were going out of her way to make the album more difficult to experience.  Melodies meander, with half-measure inserts; few songs have memorable hooks.  One song that stands out is \\"A Commotion\\" - only because its ostinato string rhythms are pounded flat with a shouted male chorus, in studied contrast to Feist's lighter tones.  However, this is not an album to which I felt invited back.  Metals just sounds a little unpolished, like its shimmy needed more shammy.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|I have searched for a regular (not Blu-ray) DVD of this that has the interview between Daniel Radcliffe and Jo Rowling, the expanded viewing with explanations of special effects, and the other good stuff that the Blu-ray package has.  It is not available to me.  This is discrimination, and another way of forcing me to buy a TV and DVD player that I don't want or need, since mine work just fine, and I don't want to replace them right now.  I am very disappointed in this trend.  It was the same with HP & DH, part 1, and other recent DVDs.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|On par with most Studio Ghibli movies, this fun and imaginative title comes from the same creator/director who brought us \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\\" which is another fantastic film.

Definitely a must watch if you're a fan of animated movies.

B0036OS3Q0|4.0|I am a 10 1/2 Wide (11 W is what I usually have to buy).  I read the reviews and took my chances, even though I couldn't go up a size like people recommended.    I bought an 11, and the actual footbed fit with plenty of room, but the instep is not high enough, especially towards the ankle.  I have extremely wide feet, so I can't imagine this boot not being wide enough for anyone's foot.  But, unless you have a low instep--in other words if your foot is the same height from the toes to your ankle, it will probably be too tight for you.

AND the movie is coming out soon!!! which makes reading the book a win win.

B005HP2JAM|5.0|About 40,000 years ago there was a 'great leap forward' when palaeolithic man began to think in the abstract and use symbols.  he no longer simply reacted to the world but he began to interpret  and reproduce it with sculpture and drawing. he acquired skills that were beyond those needed for basic survival.  Neanderthal man it seems never made this leap.  Perhaps that had something to do with his demise.  I also read if the neanderthal birthrate was 2% higher or death rate 2% lower they might've survived. Maybe it was simple math, or maybe it was the inability to think abstractly, or maybe both. ...the stunning art in this cave was drawn for over 5,000 years from 33 to 28 thousand years ago.  Many of the drawings were in conjunction with each other like a mind-bogglingly long ongoing art project (outside of time.)  the cave was sealed shut by a rock slide about 20,000 years ago which helped preserve the drawings.  I wonder why there were no drawings during the 8,000 years before the rock slide because apparently the cave would've still been functional then....so many mysteries so little time.  If anyone knows, please inform.  thanks
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I just finished reading the book last night, and it left me feeling mad, upset, disappointed!  How in the world could the author end the book this way????  She spends about 90% of the book building up the confrontation between Katniss and Snow, and blah...we get nothing.  I read intently for 2.5 books about the Peeta and Gale triangle, and blah...once again nothing.  So many plots sewn up with one or two pages of resolution.  There is nothing I can't stand more than leaving a reader hanging.  The author must have been to scared to use her writing skills to fulfill what she has been promising this whole time.  She felt the need to cop out of her responsibility to all of us readers.<br /><br />Also, people believe that the negative reviews have to do with a missing fairytale ending.  However, I have to say that the entire series is a bunch of 'fairytale endings' with her winning the first games, surviving the second games, so why can't we expect it from the 3rd?  I didn't even need it to end happily, but at least deeply would have been better than flat.<br /><br />This was an unbelievable ending and not in a good way.

B005URRCUY|2.0|Its hard to believe this is the same band that made Thickfreakness and Rubber Factory.  Those albums had a unique and interesting sound that had an edge to it.  This album is over-processed and boring.  I could barely make it through the entire album the first time I listened to it.  They need to drop the big name producer, move back to Akron and get back to making music that has some real emotions.

0240815807|5.0|Mike Senior's \\"Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio\\" is one of the best books I've read about how to deal with (and overcome) the often frustrating obstacles you'll encounter in trying to obtain reliable mixes in the less-than-ideal environment of a home studio. He explains his ideas with clarity and brevity, which I really appreciated since I am not all that familiar with some of the more advanced mixing concepts. I recommend this book highly to anyone desirous of learning how to mix music and get wonderful results despite the limitations of the small studio environment, which often does not have all the bells and   whistles of a commercial facility. For me, personally, I came away from this book with a much clearer understanding of the often arcane art of mixing. But the most important thing I discovered was that being a songwriter/singer/performer first and foremost, I did not want to put on the extra hat of mix engineer--I would much rather leave that to a professional. Making demos of your music is one thing, but I'm finishing work on recording an album, and I believe it would be to my advantage to let a professional do the mixing. That is no small revelation.   \\"Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio\\" will be an invaluable resource to anyone who wants to spend the time and effort to create world-class mixes at home. But even if, like me, you find that you don't want to take your mixing to that level, you can still learn a lot. And what you will learn will make your home mixes sound much more professional. You couldn't ask for a better guide.

030788743X|4.0|In reading player one, I felt like I was reconnecting with parts of me which I had forgotten, books I had once read, songs I had once loved, and video games I had once played - and quietly forgotten for 20 years.  Perhaps painfully it showed how nerdy/bookish I was in the 90's when I all this was going on.  I simply don't understand how people who didn't live through the time period, or were cool in the 80's-90's, could appreciate more than 25% of the references - Cline moves seemlessly from referencing 1960's computer games, to dropping a refence to PanGalactic Gargleblasters (go Zaphod), to vivid discussion of mechs from various anime series.  Rarely does a paragraph go by without an obscure reference to some piece of pop and unpop culture gome by.  It is impossible to not think of Steve Jobs, probably deliberatly so, but the book predates his death.  My only criticism of the book is that the amount of imbedded trivia often interferes with appreciation of the light plot - you are often taken out of the convention of the book to think of the shows, anime, rpgs, video games or songs that are referenced.  That being said - I am recommending it to everyone i grew up with, as a true trip down memory lane (despite being set in the future).

0307891372|4.0|This Strategy guide is extremely thorough and helpful for finding anything in the game and was well worth the money I paid for it. The only Cons I had was the index is way to short for all the info packed into the guide and to find full info on something you had to flip through multiple locations. Also if you are looking for something specific like trainers or a quest item you found without starting the quest you had to flip through the whole guide as they werent listed in either the table of contents or the index. I also dislike the fact that when it listed a location in the quest or basic info section you had to flip to the index to find the map code for the map poster. I doubt it would have added any pages to the guide if the added the map code in parentheses and a smaller font where they listed where to go in the quest or basicinfo sections. Despite these draw backs though a very thorough and well written guide.
B006JN5KBG|1.0|There is no way I'm paying this price for a blu-ray of \\"Fright Night\\".  Like I buy into the 3000 limited editions only scam.  And no extras???  I've read some reviews and the quality of the transfer is just ok.  We'll be seeing this at WalMart for $15 eventually.  Love the movie, but what a marketing crock.
0439023521|3.0|This is a good book, interesting premise and a fun, quick read. However, the way the \\"love story\\" is developed and culminates is sort of difficult to believe. And for someone who reads a fair amount of science fiction/futuristic kind of writing, I was disappointed that the overall backdrop of the world was fairly thin.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is a beautiful movie.  It's hard to believe 2D animation can be this breathtaking!  We don't watch a whole lot of TV with our 2yr old but this is an exception.  Even as adults, my wife and I love this movie.  For young children, it's refreshing because it's an epic story without being violent or graphic.  As a parent, you can truely relax and be comfortable watching with kids.  Our daughter watches along singing and smiling.  Also, the music is amazing and on Blu ray, the effects are stunning.  I'm really surprised this movie has not caught on more.  Plenty of reviews go into the story / plot so I won't rehash that in this review.  Just an outstanding movie on many levels and well worth owning.
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|I bought this Item looking for a high quality gaming headset after other cheaper headsets failed to last three months. the headset arrived in mint condition and worked perfectly for 4 months then the connector that the cable jacked into in the headset failed I was unable to do a warranty claim due to a lack of internet. I will say that the headset was made out of the same high quality materials as another pair of headphones I have had for years that still work so I was expecting the same result. I do intend to try a new pair as soon as I have the money but my budget right now just doesnt allow it.  I did find it to be a rather long process to register the product with steelseries so if you do buy this product I would suggest registering this product right away so you can do a warranty return if you need to.
B005SJIP2S|1.0|Firstly, 5 stars????? For me 5 stars are Close to the Edge or Fragile or Relayer. What are you smoking, so called \\"Yes fans\\" giving this parody on Yes 5 stars?  It has the artwork stolen from Keys of Ascension, one of the best CLASSIC Yes live set.  The trio that represent the current castrated Yes clearly understands that they are just miserable copy of the past glory, so they are eager to capitalize from that past glory of the classic Yes line-up by stealing the artwork and by calling the current band \\"Yes\\".  Well, Downs ain't Rick Wakeman, and Oliver is not his dad, and Benoit.... Oh, he is a good singer for his own band and for the Yes tribute, but replacing Jon Anderson?   The shame with the modern \\"Yes\\", or to be precise, with the walking dead \\"Yes\\", is going on.  Led Zeppelin decided to call it quit when they lost a drummer, not even their voice or a major composer or arranger! And they are respected for it.   I cannot say the same about the current \\"Yes\\".

B005URRCUY|2.0|Why the Keys let Danger Mouse alter their sound is beyond me?  The last three albums have been a marked departure from what made them a good band in the first place.  When you only have a guitar player and drummer, the sound you put out is noticeably sparse.  Or it should be.  That sparseness and raw electricity is what made the Keys so great, especially in this age of over-produced pop trash.  Gone are the raw sounds of \\"The Big Come Up\\", \\"Thickfreakness\\", the excellent Junior Kimbrough tribute \\"Chulahoma\\", and the slightly pop-ier but still pretty good \\"Rubber Factory\\" and \\"Magic Potion.\\"  In are the synth and over dubbed crap synonymous with pc-sound guys like this Danger Mouse dude.  Many people like that sort of sound.  I'm not one of them.  Bring back music with some raw emotion and less of the emo-tinged trash.

B005C9YZIW|2.0|Do you like death? Well, if so you're in for a treat in this video series. Along with some of the most jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring shots ever put on film, you'll get a heavy barrage of animals hunting and eating each other. Understand, my wife and I are not vegetarians nor are we easily made squeemish. Our complaint about this series is the mind-numbing repetitiveness. Unbelievable overhead shots of are only part of this series. The rest is one animal after another stalking, killing and eating another. And it goes on like this over and over again every episode: stalk, kill, eat, stalk, kill, eat, etc. etc. As soon as you see some cute fuzzy thing on this show, you can rest assured it will be eaten alive in the next few minutes. In the episode on the Great Pains, we counted (yes, it was so repetitive we starting counting the kills) more than 10 kills in the one, 50-minute episode. That's one kill every 5 minutes.   Listen, we all know that hunting prey is a large part of life in the wild - it's feeding time 24/7 out there - but surely there are other aspects of life on earth. Couldn't the filmmakers could have shown us as those as well? What about nesting behaviour or mating rituals or raising the young? What about environmental science? There are so many things the filmmakers could have taught us about our planet. Yet everything is ignored for the sake of showing us one more kill. Such a shame, and a complete waste of spectacular cinemaphotography.

The doctors or anyone dont know what is wrong with him, but in reality he is trapped between the spirit world and ours. All the things his mother had been hearing and seeing are the spirits trying to get into his body. Later on in the movie they make contact with the spirit trying to get into his body and he is not very pleased of them trying to have danny back, so he shows them that he is in charge of danny now. Towards the end Danny's father finds out that he can too travel to the other side into the spirit world, whuch he does just to find Danny chained up in what seemed like a dungen. He rescues him by takung him back to his body, but the reason i wouldnt recommend this movie is because the ending was weak. Instead of a happy ending when they get back to the real life his father is possesed by a spirit.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved this book. Though full of typos, I understood, and I'll be biting my nails for 9 months until the next one comes out.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|I've been playing settlers now for 10 years. It's a great game. It's the new classic in board games. The game is easily enjoyed. Again,10 years... and we still play this game, that should say a lot for it.<br /><br />Pros: 90 minute game makes it a fair playing time. It's pretty simple, yet still challenging.<br />Negatives: the basic game does have a high level of luck in it. Luck based on the throw of the dice.<br /><br />Still a great game and with the addition of Cities and Knights it's one of our favorite games still.
B000GWE44U|2.0|The Shining is an older made movie. Jack Nicholson was really young and begining in his career. Jack is a father looking for a job to supply his family. He found an outlook hotel deep in the top of the montains. His son Danny would have visions of someone telling him not to go to the outlook, but in the end they decided to go. Everything seemed ok when they got their but they were going to be the only ones their since during the winter months that it would close only the caregiver and if he choose his family would stay there. Little by little Danny the child started seeing things that he couldnt explain, but his parents wouldnt believe him. He was always lead to an especific room where a father had killed his twin daughters and wife before killing himself. The surprise turn happens when his father Jack is the one going crazy from the isolation that he to begins seeng people. The difference between them two was that jack had really become possesed by the hotel and decided to kill his wofe and danny. They outsmarted him and he ended up deying. The is also a book for this movies and the book is a lot different than the movie is. Its and Ok moie but i wouldnt recomend it to anyone.
B004WE01YA|5.0|What can I say about this Disney \\"Classic\\" of the modern era...I loved it when it came out in the theatres, I loved the \\"work print\\" on Laser Disc, I loved the DVD when it came out and now I have (I hope) the ultimate edition on Blue Ray and 3D to boot.  For me the 3D only makes an almost perfect movie even better.  The 3D adds obvious dimension to an already \\"3D\\" story and animation.  Is it needed?  Absolutely not!  This animated classic, arguably one of Disney's best ever, was perfect when it was released in the theatres.  To be honest only a Disney completest would really need or want this. Which is why I now own it!

B00000JMOF|5.0|I have long been a fan of this adaptation of 'Frankenstein'.  Please teachers, this is NOT closely based on the book so do not buy it if you think it will reflect Mary Shelley's book. It is SUPPOSED to be the old, campy, classic James Whale production that I used to watch as a kid. It did terrify audiences when it was originally released. All the silly complaints of bad acting, script, etc...yes, yes, yes! That's what it was supposed to be!
B005URRCUY|3.0|I must confess after Attack and Release I couldn't stop lisening to the Black Keys. But after the last two releases, I'm done. If your expecting anything like A&R forget it. In my opinion this band has sold out. Skip it.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|I bought a similar watch to this at a great price here from amazon.com.  The great price was possibly due to it being a \\"last years model watch.\\" I wore it for about 2 months before one of the 2 main links that connect the band to the watch had broke.  This of course dropped the watch, resulting in cracked crystal.  Trying to find proper warranty information was difficult. Amazon said to contact the manufacturer, Invicta's website is clear but the warranty guidelines are not. To contact someone, I made an email to the sales department describing the situation. They responded personally to my email which was good and within a day or two, but with less than appealing news. Invicta will take the watch in for repairs but with a charge for repairs including a $28 shipping and handling fee which alone is half of what I paid for the watch! So, my assumption is, after 2 months, a broken band link is not a warranty issue. Either this or I don't know the full meaning of \\"Warranty Coverage\\". Great watches, great prices, pain in the butt service. Thanks.

B0057R5XRG|4.0|Like everyone else on here you can not deny the technology advancement of this film or the great direction by Spielberg.<br /><br />Pro's<br />Great film<br />3/4 of film scenes are better on Blue Ray<br /><br />Con's<br />Certain scenes have a very grainy appearance, that looks like a VHS experience not Blu Ray/<br /><br />Sound is weak at times.  Dinosaurs yell but don't roar. Disappointing.<br /><br />The worst scene is the start of the Jurassic Park tour. When they are seated in the auditorium and it begins to move.  That scene for 5-10 minutes is horribly grainy, extremely bad picture.<br /><br />The other let down I think is the surround sound.  Spielberg couldn't get THX for this? The sound of the dinosaurs are weak, in my opinion.  I personally think that when a T-Rex roars I want my 5.1 sound system and house to shake, it didn't.<br /><br />Still overall a great film.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is fun, I usually don't buy apps but the free version got me hooked. I haven't put it down down! I can't wait to beat this game!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This item do warrant a closer look.<br /><br />Musically, it is hard to fault Born This Way. It's a very edgy marriage of dance, 80s pop, rock, opera, electronic, fashion, the future manifesto and religion. Hardly a subtle aural assault.<br /><br />It's fantastic when played really loud, especially on The Edge Of Glory where she sings her guts out. Tracks like Hair and The Edge Of Glory are in the rein of 80s hit St Elmo's Fire while You And I is very Aerosmith. Why so? Because it comes from the same spiritual source.<br /><br />Lyrically, there are obvious and veiled references to who this spirit being is. In Born This Way, Gaga's introduces this being as \\"capital HIM\\". She is not referring to a king but someone greater than mankind.<br /><br />Judas would make Gaga's choice clear. One can interpret the lyrics as a metaphor for her choosing bad boys for love. But the lyrics are obvious about Gaga's spiritual alliance, \\"Jesus is my virtue but Judas is the demon I cling to.\\" You might want to watch Gaga's video to decipher who the symbolism's all about. Vigilantcitizen.com is a good place to start.<br /><br />Like Madonna and Prince before her, Gaga is disturbing with her take on Jesus Christ. Bloody Mary and \\"Jesus is the new black.\\" Somehow it doesn't add up. Gaga's work contains lots of biblical and spiritual references so parental guidance are needed since minors are too young to really understand the content.<br /><br />The Bonus Disc:<br />My favorites are the Born This Way Country version and the remix of Fashion Of His Love. Did not really enjoy the rest.<br /><br />The Born This Way Tour:<br />When this came to Singapore, Gaga packed  the stadium for three nights - a record for a western artist. On one of those dates I logged on and tried to get tickets. Somehow, the credit card and bank would not cooperate. So I got dressed to buy tickets off the counter, only to see the sky darken ominously. I then gave up going out. After ten minutes, the sky brightened.It is as if someone is trying to prevent me from going. Uncanny.<br /><br />Thanks to the kind souls who loaded the concert on YouTube.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|A great end to a great series.  My son has greatly enjoyed watching these AFTER he reads the books.  The ability to see it brought to life has been sweet.
B005OLUOVA|5.0|Rammstein has always given their fans much respect when it comes to not doing things in a half-arsed way or ripping them off with money grabs like, for example, Depeche Mode.  Which was why I was astounded when I received my box set in the mail yesterday and it was less than satisfactory.  Luckily I came here and read a review that mentioned quality control issues.  Here are the issues identified by Rammstein, who have said that any defects will be fixed.<br /><br />1)missing/duplicate discs,<br />2) undeburred box edges (can cut skin),<br />3) Printing errors on metal box and/or metal slipcase<br />4) stained clothes<br />5) unsatisfactory book binding.<br /><br />See the Rammstein site on how to exchange these items if you are affected.<br /><br />Despite this, the box set is a magnificent thank you to fans.  There is an enormous amount of material here, and the dvds have obviously been produced to high quality standards.  And once the quality control issues have been resolved, it will probably be one of the best put together box sets in my collection.<br /><br />The only downside, is that the music suffers from the loudness war.  Since there is a maximum loudness level available to recording, (which is different from playback voulme, which you control), boosting the overall loudness of a song or track eventually creates a piece that is maximally and uniformly loud from beginning to end. This creates music with a small dynamic range (i.e., little difference between loud and quiet sections), rendering it fatiguing and robbing it of emotional power.  In modern music, that means a drum hit is no louder than a quiet vocal-only section because both have been raised to the maximum by the mastering and/or recording engineer.  Other effects include clipping and distortion as the top of the soundwave is either hammer squashed or mercilessly chopped off.  But this phenomena exists in almost all music of this type, nonetheless, I would have hoped that Rammstein would release a so-called audiophile edition some day that restores the power and emotion that only music with real dynamics can have.  If you want more info, lookup 'loudness war' at wikipedia.<br /><br />cheers.ores the power and emotion that only music with real dynamics can have.

B000001FS3|4.0|by 1987, there were ont many rock bands left !  springsteen, mellencamp, and bryan adams were at their peak and ready to fold it or take a holiday, and all the old dinosaurs were done !  so, U2 pretty much had the stage to themselves and they took full advantage of it ... good for them.  my favourite is side 2 - with Red Hill, Gods country, and so on ... yes there are hits but side 2 is much better yet - all in all a very good albun (as in vinyl LP).
1451627289|2.0|Kings' prose resonates so well when tuned, this time however it begins and maintains a boring nature that doesn't seem to gain sufficient traction to provide satisfaction or benefit to out weigh the shear bulk of this tome.

B0050SYS5A|3.0|I was hesitant to buy this after reading some of the reviews. But there is absolutely nothing else on the market, from what I can find, which will decrease the minimum distance required by the kinect. So, my thoughts:  1. The distance decrease is not all that dramatic. Instead of the front of the sensor area being the front of my couch, it is now the 1 1/2- 2 feet in front of the couch. Still, it actually allows me to play the games, which is a plus.  2. For more coarse motions, this is fine. My wife and I have played Fruit Ninja, Dance Central 2 and Fitness Evolved 2012 without any real issue.  3. Games that are more sensitive to fine-motion are problematic, like the Michael Jackson Experience. This game, the game plays...well but not fantastic. Certainly playable, no question. The menu interface is a nightmare, however.  4. I saw people complain about the hand tracking. There's a reason for that. Some games allow you to see larger versions of the blob that the kinect sees as you. With arms, it has a tendency to either make the arms past the elbow disappear, or for the area between elbow and wrist disappear, so that it has difficulty is figuring out what that floating blob (your hand) is. This leads to some real nightmares with menu interfaces. The same thing happens with legs- they often simply disappear below the knee.  5. When you do the kinect tuner, you can see what the camera sees through the zoom, and it clarifies the tracking issues. The lenses used actively interfere with the image processed. You can see that the world seen by the kinect with the zoom on is splotchy, the splotches being the lens in front. It is NOT grease or dirt on the lens, I was extremely careful with that. It is just a problem wth the lenses themselves. Perhaps if the lenses were replaced, this wouldn't be an issue.  6. Ultimately: If you have the space so that you don't need this, stay away. If you are like me and don't have the space, you really don't have any other choice. It's notgreat, but with a little patience it will get the job done. The choice was between moving the couch and buying this. For me, there was no question- I bought the Zoom.  And for better or for worse, I stand by that. If I had the space, I would chuck it in a heartbeat though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great game and is alot of fun! I enjoy it, especially since it has a left hand setting!
0307279189|5.0|I have been a runner for over a year, in the sense that the US Army requires me to run. Recently, I began enjoying it. Loving it, even. My fun run Sunday is the best day of the week, because I just go, go, go. At any rate, as a new runner, in this new sense of actually enjoying the activity, I picked this book up as a starting point. The title does promise a lot. It delivers, for the most part, as well. \\"Born to Run,\\" a story about a journalist's journey to find a cure for his pained foot. The hidden tribe are the Rajamuri or Tarahumara from the Copper Canyons of Mexico.   They are, or at least the people introduced in the book, are \\"super athlete's\\" by most athlete's sense and definitely in the case of couch potatoes. The author embellishes that these people can run over 100 miles a race, at a time, in sandals, etc. Take the embellishments with a grain of salt. The greatest race might be a bit of a stretch. As a new born Runner, I can't say what is the greatest race is. But from the authors perspective, he paints the picture that it certainly is.   What I love about this book is the introduction of people you, if you are a Runner, should know. If you are not a Runner, perhaps you'll find some of his tangents entertaining (various coaches, athletes, Nike, and so on.) If I were to rail this story down to two words, it would be \\"run barefoot.\\"
B002HWRYJE|4.0|This was a great movie to watch. I'm a self proclaimed trekkie, so it was cool to see the old characters back, even if it was just one. It is action packed, witty, silly at times and overall a decent film.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I'm embarrassed to say, I don't remember this show on TV at all! Good thing my boss suggested it on Netflix. After getting my DVD's, I've watched both seasons at least 20 times now!! I was hooked on it 4 minutes and 40 seconds in the first episode. A shirtless Craig Horner is something to behold, YUM! The episodes are fast paced, with romance, humor and edge-of-your-seat excitement. I lost some serious sleep watching this the first time through! The cast is phenomenal. Craig, Bridget and Bruce were born for these roles. I can't believe they canceled this show! Whoever made that decision is seriously disturbed. So being cheated out of further episodes, I read the books too. They have their own qualities, but the show is better!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a solid, straight-forward chess app.  Nice classic look to it and nothing fancy, but not completely bare either.  It has sound effects, a timer, and two-player option.  It is worth the dollar or two normally asked for it, and a great deal for faotd.  Installed and works just fine on my HTC EVO.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is a movie that you can really relate to, the crazyness of high school sports if you have ever played (for a good team.) The characters in this film are so strong, QB Mike Winchell, James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, Chavez, Don Billingsly and even the quite Ivory Christian was a strong character as well as Coach Gaines.   This portrays how crazy high school football can be in Texas and how sometimes it may go a little too far. The radio announcers were a strong feature to this as well. The players doing actual football plays, blood, pain in their voices, sadness, triumph, partying. It was all there and I can truly say one of the best sports movies I've watched.  ****Though I have not read the book I know they are very different from each other. It is my understanding that if you really enjoyed the book you will probably hate the movie.
0553106635|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read, period. Front to back, but especially the last few hundred pages is the best story telling I've witnessed.

1451627289|5.0|This book, from the beginning, poses to you a question that so many people have probably asked themselves, would you change the past if you could?  And the one moment in time that you may think of is the Kennedy Assasination in 1963.  King presents characters to us that are so believable and relationships that are the central theme of the book.  Sure it involves time travel, but it brings you back to the late 1950's and into the early sixties, a time long gone by but described wonderfully here.  Was Oswald the lone assasin, and how would the world be different if Kennedy was not killed?  Great questions, and a great story in this book.  Read it, it simply Great!!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Fantastic blu-ray with extended version that blows away the movie theater release, 3 hours long and worth seeing again and again. No special features on this disk but to see the full cut the way it was meant to be is well worth it.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Item took a little long to get here (over two weeks).  It looks good other than the fact that the CD cover is cracked, which I was disappointed in, seeing as it is a \\"new\\" item.
0345505387|5.0|Diana Gabaldon has become my ultimate favorite author especially with her Outlander series.  This book allowed me to have a visual of what Jamie and Claire would look like in addition to some other characters in the book.  It was neat to find some answer as to what happened to her undergarment since I was wondering about that.  I wish they would do more graphic novel for the other books in the series.

B0052U59F4|4.0|***may or may not contain spoilers***<br /><br />Bought this book because of all the rave reviews.  I started the book thinking wow this author whom i've never read before is great.  I was sucked right in and couldnt put it down.  Then I get to the part we're he tells her he likes bdsm.  I hate those kind of romance.  I just could never get why people like that.  I mean he really wanted to hurt her sometimes.  I almost ended the book right there but the way the author writes had me hooked on and couldnt let go. The reason I kept reading is because I felt that Christian really is falling in love with her and that gave me hope that maybe he would forget about being the dom and just try to love her the \\"normal\\" way, if thier is a normal way (lol). In the book thier is plenty of funny, make you smile and get your heart pounding moments.  The book is definitly steamy (phew). When I decided to continue on and read about the bdsm is was actually done tasteful I thought.  Not too out of control.  A few things like repeating words the author likes to use some of the same words and that got a little old after awhile.  I also didnt like the use of all the huge words in all of thier conversations.  I consider myself of average smarts but come on,  too much.  Seems like they didnt have a normal conversation during the book at all.  I also didnt like that she was pushing Christian for answers about his past.  He was aviously tortured as a kid in some way.  I wanted to yell let it go for now at my screen.  The contract.--OMG, That grossed me out, thats when i started skimming threw it I just couldnt read it.  I am 32 years old and have no clue what half the stuff means and some of it totally made me blush.  I actually felt uncomfortable reading the contract. WOW.<br /><br />I feel like when these books have this kind of content that we as readers and buyers should be warned before we purchase a book for 7.99.  I really wish that it said that it was a BDSM book.  Then no I wouldnt have bought it.  But in the end I guess I am glad I did.  I see a love relationship coming for those two.  So on to number two, I heard its more romantic and Christian has changed a little.  Good.  That makes me happy.<br /><br />Like I said the author has a way of sucking you in to the story, I think she is an excellent writter and thats why I finished the book.  I hope I can look forward to new books from her without the BDSM.  I think she has great potential.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? I don't think my sister would enjoy this since I share all my books with her.<br /><br />*****Not a teen book, should be read by mature adults.  Strong language, adult situations, BDSM.  If you like soft romance books this is not for you.***<br /><br />*****4 stars for writting****in the end I guess I am glad I did.  I see a love relationship coming for those two.

B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I know that it isn't likely - given that he seems to write in a lot of different genres, but I picked up this book more for its subject matter than for who wrote it. I've read the gunslinger books and enjoyed them and I enjoyed this book, though for some reason I couldn't get that episode of Red Dwarf related to the Kennedy Assasination out of my mind ;-)
B005N0PJJO|4.0|OK.  So I just finished both books.  Again I gave it a 4 star because thier is a few minor things that I didnt like about both books.<br /><br />Things I liked/loved.  Christian. Need I say more?. He did a total 180 in this book.  He was much more romantic, more relaxed and much more appealing than the first book if thats even possible.  Again, I really do not like the BDSM subject in a romance, But Christian seemed like he didnt need it that much anymore and decides to be the perfect gentleman with Ana.  What a complete turn a round.<br /><br />Things I hated.  Ana just started getting on my nerves.  She whined alot, had to be reminded to eat even at the point of picking fights with Christian.  Come on, you have to be reminded to eat?  She was like \\"oh crap I forgot\\".  You forgot to eat for five days? Highly unlikely.  Also Christian was trying his hardest to be the perfect guy for her and I feel she just seemed to give him a hard time at ever turn.  She is a moron.  He asked her repeatedly not to use work e-mail to talk to him, what does she do? she does it anyway and does it on purpose. Ugh. He tries so hard to open up to her and have a \\"vanilla\\" relationship and she just ruins the scene's.  She frustrates me to no end.  This is why I gave the book 4 stars and not 5.<br /><br />Another thing is the Author though good at writting was repeating the same scene's using a few different words.  It seemed like everytime they fought they would make out.  This seemed to be repeated threw out the book.  Just like another reviewer had said. \\"How many times do people have sex\\" I agree.  I would rather have more romantic moments.<br /><br />Looking forward till Jan 2012 for fifty shades freed.  Hope Ana changes her morinic ways. (one can hope). If not it will ruin the book for me.
0131480057|5.0|I've owned three of the four editions of this book over the years, starting with the second one and having heard murmerings about the awesomeness of the first from colleagues. This book proves that Unix and Linux Systems Administration texts can be well written. I read somewhere that Tim O'Reilly wanted to emulate the quality of this book when he set up his company. The clarity that this book provides for core administration tasks is exceptional and it's a pity that few other books on the subject have approached this level of quality. I read somewhere that this will be the last edition of this book - which depresses me greatly. The core stuff is all here. How you do it changes over time. I hope that sometime in the near future there is a 5th edition.
B000002OOY|5.0|This is one of John William's best.  The only flaw is the strange order that the tracks are in.  After consulting Wikipedia's very helpful article on the Jurassic Park soundtrack, I can recommend the following re-ordering of the tracks, for an experience of the music in the order it appeared in the film... (note: I expanded the track titles according to their original names from the screenplay)<br /><br />1. Opening Titles<br />2. Journey To The Island (To the Island & The Entrance of the Park)<br />3. Theme From Jurassic Park (The Dinosaurs)<br />4. Hatching Baby Raptor (& Eggs in the Forest)<br />5. Jurassic Park Gate<br />6. Eye To Eye (& Goat Bait & Preparing to Meet the Monster)<br />7. Dennis Steals The Embryo<br />8. Incident At Isla Nublar (& The Falling Car)<br />9. A Tree For My Bed<br />10. Remembering Petticoat Lane<br />11. My Friend, The Brachiosaurus<br />12. High-Wire Stunts<br />13. The Raptor Attack (Into the Kitchen)<br />14. T-Rex Rescue & Finale (& March Past the Kitchen Utensils)<br />15. Welcome To Jurassic Park (End Credits)<br />16. End Credits (final section)<br /><br />Listening to the CD in this order makes the experience of listening to this already AWESOME soundtrack perfect.

I especially like \\"The One That Got Away.\\"  Check out the video of this song on YouTube; it's really good.  Now that I have this CD, I will purchase future Katy Perry CDs because she's very talented.
B003L77G8I|4.0|The sixth season of Bones pretty much picked up where the others left of.  It has some interesting forensic puzzles that continue to build an esoteric forensic pathology knowledge with the viewer as it builds  on the caracters developed in previous years.  The strong point of this TV series is the cameraderie and interpersonal relations built up around the core \\"team\\" and this comes in for some investigation here. Acurate investigation is the best way to describe it, the screenwriters are to be congratulated. The new phrase \\"squinterns' was coined and brought a smile.  This comes to a head when one of the team is lost to a psychopath who simply \\"got the wrong target\\".  The up-down, On-off relationship of the principles builds to a completely unforeseen crescendo ending with a veritable thunderclap and until the sound hits, you don't realize for the most part that anything's comming at all.  If you've bought the series before, this will definately NOT dissapoint.  If you're considering it for the first time, I'd strongly suggest starting with the first series and working your way through, as I bet most people who enjoy this genere would find they had to buy the whole set.  Season six, and I'm surprised its still so entertaining, dynamic and vibrant, I look forward eagerly to season seven.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I've had these headsets for about two years now. They are very durable and I believe they last very long. The mic output is pretty decent; not the best obviously. I recommend these to anyone that is looking for a cheap gaming headset. Before these I was using cheap $15 logitech headsets that broke on me every month or so. Once I got these I basically never went to any other pc headset.THe cable is pretty thick. I don't know how many times I broke my logitech headsets because my chair ran over the wire. For this headset though the wires are very thick and if you do happen to run over it with your chair(like I do) it won't damage it. There are only a couple things I don't like about it. I don't know why but for some reason one of my cups collects A LOT of lint and the cup looks like completely white and the other cup is black and is like what the other one is suppose to look like. The other thing I don't like about it is that when someone is near you and you're like listening to music through it or something, that person can hear everything because there's no noise isolation. It's not too much of a problem though unless you don't like other people listening to your stuff. The cups are decently comfortable. They aren't the best but after like a couple hours it gets kind of annoying. Other than that though I've used these for two years so the complaints I have for this are incomparable to the duarbility of this thing. It's been the best headset I've had so for, but sadly I don't pc game as much so I'm going to get a ps3 and pc compatible headset soon that will probably replace this D: I will still keep it as a back up though!
B000VBIGD6|1.0|I understand that this movie does not assert to convey any kind of heartwarming message of Christmas.  If you want that type of movie, may I heartily recommend It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, or even the animated Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  However, this movie does bill itself as being funny and funny it's not.  It's a tasteless, worthless, overly contrived piece of trash.  In my opinion, outlandish displays of stupidity are NEVER funny, they're just plain stupid and PATHETIC.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I must of seen this movie 3 times at the theater in 1980. Watching it now more than 30 years later it's still one of my favorite cult flicks. Don't hesitate to buy this blu-ray version even if you have the Saviour of the universe edition dvd. The picture quality is stunning. Has a cool menu as well. Same extras i believe as the saviour edition but the blu-ray upgrade is worth it alone.
1451627289|5.0|The biggest problem with alternative histories isn't the alternative part but rather simply the historical part.<br /><br />Put simply:  the fictional treatments all too often twist the historical character(s) into unrecognizabilty.<br /><br />This not so here.  As portrayed in this book Lee Harvey Oswald -- aside from whatever politics or ambitions he had -- was a spouse abuser.  He was an uneducated know it all who thought himself better than others.  Marina Oswald, his Russian bride, was beautiful and chose to suffer his abuses despite chances to run from them (apparently Russian 50s/60s women were all too similar to their American counterparts).<br /><br />Even the secondary characters are played just right. For those more interested in this aspect of this book they can purchase a copy of On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald and see all these characters for themselves.  On Trial was footage from a mock trial conducted by Vincent Bugliosi pairing off against Gerry Spence to answer the questions raised in this book:  was Oswald guilty of shooting Kennedy and did he act alone.<br /><br />In answering both those questions in the affirmative, On Trial presented evidence from actual witnesses including:<br /><br />Special Agent James P. Hosty.  As described in this book, Hosty did seek out Oswald prior to the assassination.  Hosty did get a threatening note from Oswald prior to the assassination.  And perhaps most damningly, Hosty destroyed the note.  In On Trial you get to see Hosty's demeanor as he takes questions from both Bugliosi and Spence but for my money King's treatment of his demeanor in this book is spot on.<br /><br />Ruth Paine.  As described in this book, Paine was indeed part of that greater Russian emigre community.  Like Hosty her testimony is preserved in On Trial as well as her demeanor.  And like with Hosty I think King's treatment of her is completely accurate.<br /><br />I could go on but without exception King's development of both the greater and lesser characters involved in the Kennedy assassination shows the considerable research and time he put into creating this work.  At the close of the book, King said he'd first contemplated this project back in 1972, that he'd read extensively prior to finishing it and also that he'd personally visited the crucial scenes in question.  His flawless attention to detail is so considerable that in my opinion it actually merited the title for this review.<br /><br />So like I said as to what really happened I give King top grades on this book.<br /><br />Surprisingly (and I mean really surprisngly for me given the fact that this book was written by Stephen King), the place where I think he runs into problems is when he discusses his alternative history.<br /><br />As with Tommy Knockers, King -- a far greater storyteller than imagineer -- takes an animorphic view of time.  Whatever Einstein or modern physics may say, according to King time is this monsterous thing that that will get you if you mess with it.  How this eventually plays out at the end of the book I think is not only inconsistent with modern physics but actually even limits the power of the story itself too.<br /><br />For those interested, there are several fun and informative books on time and how it works.  For casual readers I would suggest Michio Kaku's wonderful Hyperspace.  For the more amibtious readers I would suggest Paul Davies excellent About Time.  And for the scholarly readers I would suggest Dieter Lee's Physical Basis for the Direction of Time.  All three works harmonize with the predominant so called many worlds view in physics that all realities that are possible do occur...a tantalizing thought not only as to the Kennedy assassination but also as to any life event as well.<br /><br />For my money, by staying with reality as to the history yet straying from reality as to the physics King's book suffered a bit.<br /><br />It didn't suffer much though because we're still talking about Stephen Kinghere which means you'll at least get a very good story.

1419702238|2.0|My daughter is a big fan of this series, so being the 'brilliant' mother that I am, I ordered the latest book.  However, when I received the item (in a timely matter, no less) it was bound...upside down! Now, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer....but isn't this a HUGE mistake?  Or are all the Wimpy Kid books like this? (Or perhaps....just the really 'cool'...'rare' ones? lol) Lucky for me I am only gifting it to my 10 year old child and not someone that would see it as a TOTAL knock off.  Good luck! GOD Bless.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Like many reviewers here, I am a fan of most of actors and Richard Curtis's previous films. Though there are hints of good acting here and there, and some funny and clever moments, overall the film left me with an uneasy feeling. I liked it enough to buy the DVD when it came out, but as I watched it I started to realize how much has changed in Britain and society since Four Weddings and A Funeral came out. What this film really is, is a baby boomer/Richard Curtis 'fantasy' about how Britain should be: irreverent, multicultural, highly sexual (even children), shallow and nihilistic. In the director's commentary Curtis hints that he didn't make that decision himself. He comments how there were many, loud complaints about the lack of minority characters in his previous films. Here it's blunt, clumsy in your face miscegenation, carefully color coded characters, happy never never land diversity. There is nothing wrong with 'ideals' but these are more like political messages, and so out of touch with reality suspension of disbelief is difficult.  Curtis also creates a 'fantasy' prime minister that actually speaks up about the failure American foreign policy, but he can't take himself too seriously, and in essence, Curtis unwillingly shows why Britain cannot standup for herself; She has lost her confidence in being British and doesn't believe Englishness is anything special.   Others have commented on the inappropriateness of the child romance - an elementary school kid having a lusty sexual conversation with his step father. \\"rock stars shag chicks\\" ... I couldn't believe it, but then I realized its a perfect reflection of what the current elite in Britian and the US want for our society.   I also believe that since the success and attraction of the very 'English\\" previous films, Curtis was pressured to make them more multicultural and less English. Again, the commentary, Curtis unwittingly alludes to that.   The highlights of this film, I think was the romance between Firth and Portuguese maid (though frankly shallow and unbelievable, I suppose like many middle aged men I am willing to suspend disbelief :) ) , and the haunting beautiful soundtrack.   I personally believe that what we watch for 'entertainment' profoundly effects us, and I believe the overall 'message' of this film is bad for the soul.

0307593312|1.0|I am not a fan of Haruki though I liked his novels 15 years ago when I was young.  I read this novel just to have some fun, and I thought that the novel must be at least engaging to be as popular as it seems to be through media.    The novel makes the reader curious (and in fact, makes me keep reading through), because the story is mysterious.  The problem is that the story remains nonsense after reading till the end.  Of course, one can interpret the novel to make sense out of the nonsense, but I am not interested in analyzing the novel.  The ending is nonsense as the rest of the novel, and quite poor and abrupt leaving all the mystery unsolved.  I felt deceived at the end, but it may be my fault that I expected a wrong thing from the novel (and this is the reason for writing this review: to warn the potential readers with wrong expectation).  It is not just the ending that I do not like.  The characters in the novel are 1 dimensional and shallow.  The novel often explains at length what is going on in the minds of characters, and it is often extremely boring, repetitive and redundant.  I may have tolerated this novel if I were a teenage boy who pretends to read a big novel, but I would also advise any teenage boy not to waste his time on this pretentious nonsense if I were his father.

B000000H4V|5.0|They say time is the greatest test of quality, and Sepultura - Chaos A.D. is testament to that statement. Released almost 20 years ago, it still sounds heavier and fresher than most metal albums released today. Sepultura really found their niche on this record, mixing tribal elements and basing lyrics on events from their home country of Brazil to create a unique masterpiece. Max's vocals hit a career high (or low!) on this album and hopefully the original lineup will reunite and possibly play this album in full! what a dream that would be!
1250004349|4.0|I read this book not to say that I read another book, but I wanted to get insight and read something that I am not used too. This book did it. I was emotionally drawn to the storyline and  by what the Jews experienced<br />during the War in paris at that time. Torture and suffering only gives a few highlights but Sarah's Key takes on a deeper meaning as you read further. I have found out that mass genocide is not biased. It has touched every culture and nationality.

1451627289|5.0|I've never read anything by Stephen King before, but I couldn't resist the title--my generation's 9/11. He took me back to the time that made me, conceived of a quest which, if it were possible, I'd sign up for in a heartbeat, reminded me that high ideals don't always produce good outcomes, and then reassured me that even if I can't change the world, living according to my ideals and treating the people around me with decency is sufficient. Not a bad message for us boomers as that good night looms ever nearer.
0195067142|3.0|I highly respect Eugene Sledge and his service to our country.  Read that sentence again, please.  Sledge was not in a rifle platoon, which I should have realized and thought more about as I began reading this book.  I found myself more often than not wanting to read about these campaigns from the perspective of a man in a rifle platoon.  Most of the time Sledge was one to several hundred meters behind the assault platoons...supporting them....doing his job.  The point of this review is to convey this point clearly to those who might be disappointed as I was.  I have nothing negative to say about Eugene, his writing style, or the structure of the work.  Ultimately, I found this book a little boring, more an account of front line living conditions, instead of front line action.  I will be attacked by Sledgeites who will call me insane and state that Eugene was on the front lines.  Again, I would only make the distinction that he was not in a rifle platoon, thus he had a different vantage point as a mortor man.  I should have understood this better before I read the book, but was persuaded by the many 5 star reviews and failed to do my research.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app works great with the Kindle Fire and will not require any complex steps to get up and running for most people.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of optional end-to-end encryption at the time of this review. This is one reason why Splashtop is so much faster than the competition. On Splashtop's official support forum, they also admit this was done on purpose to maximize performance. This is fine, but I think there should be optional encryption for those who won't mind slower performance in favor of a more secure connection on public wi-fi.<br /><br />You do indeed need to create a security code for your computer and the Android app so it's not like your computer and your Android device is left wide open to be taken over, but the session can still be snooped on. The good news is that I read a forum post by a staff member on September 1, 2011, that additional security features are being planned. I will edit this review when those security features are released.<br /><br />Another piece of good news is that encryption isn't really needed when you use this app to connect to your own computers on your own home network as long as your wi-fi is secured properly (preferably using at least WPA2). When using Splashtop on public wi-fi networks at restaurants, cafes, library, airport, etc, you are at a risk since there is no encryption like with some other remote desktop apps for Android. Honestly, most people are not going to bother snooping on your remote desktop session or even know how to do it, but the risk is still there if you happen to be on the same public network as someone savvy and crooked enough to do it.<br /><br />So for now, I will only use this app on my own home network. Until they update Splashtop with additional security features to make using it on public wi-fi more secure, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars. If you're only going to do things like remotely play games or watch movies, I wouldn't worry too much about the lack of encryption. It would probably just make the game or movie too slow anyway. If you're going to view your banking info or sensitive documents, then use some caution. The connection between the bank and your remote PC is secure, but the session between the remote PC and your Android device could possibly be seen by someone else on open public wi-fi. Probably won't happen to you, but possible.<br /><br />Anyway, no regrets at all for buying this product! For those of you who are more curious about this topic, I recommend you visit their official forums and do a search for \\"encryption\\" or \\"secure.\\" Thanks for reading.low anyway.

B003UYUQZW|3.0|This Disney throwback to an earlier epic film era is plagued with ridiculous fake pompous British accents by everyone in the cast. No one in the time of this Middle Ages movie, set in what is today modern day Iraq, would have been speaking English, much less with a fake Brit accent. The whole thing carries on too long. The plot is a family drama, which combines elements of the Lord of the Rings with 1950s B-movie fantasy. There's plenty of brief comic relief, mostly when certain of the characters sort of step out of character for a second or two to indulge in some post-modern banter which is also out of place. Jake Gyllenhaal looks ridiculous all pumped up, and the plumped up baby lips of the leading lady drove me to distraction. Not much entertainment here for thinking adults with at least some higher education.

0470449748|5.0|I bought this book after my first failed GMAT. This is MUST HAVE book for preparation, cause it gives you great overview of real GMAT questions. For my 1st exam I prepared just on the Veritas courses. It was helpful, but only for 30-40% of the test. The main difference between this book and other books for GMAT (Manhattan, Veritas, etc.) is that OG shows you questions' types (about 90% of the questions, similar to the real GMAT qstns are covered here) and other books show you the explanation of how to solve them fast (as I wrote before, about 30-40% of the questions, similar to the real GMAT qstns were covered on Veritas courses). Now I use OG, The Power Score Critical Reasoning Bible and Manhattan Sentence Correction books.   Hope it helps! Good luck on the GMAT!

1466401885|5.0|Its like when a volcano meets a tornado...thats the only way I can think to describe this book. If you are looking for a fairytale this is not it. Yes there is a happy ending that you may not expect but if you are waiting on Prince Charming to rescue Cinderella then you are reading the wrong book.   The title is Beautiful Disaster for a reason. Human nature is that we can do bad on our own but most of us are just as well satisfied with tormenting ourselves and Travis and Abby are no exception. However, like the feeling you get after any natural disaster when you see the first signs of new life and growth, the first signs that the world will go on beyond the distruction that has been left behind and long forgotten you see what is left is beautiful, signs of hope and that is what this book ends with.   This is one of those books that you stumble across and you wonder why on earth you haven't heard of it before. I devoured it in a day. I must say about 75% of the way through my emotions were everywhere. I felt like this is quite possibly a book I could have written in college.   I know there are alot of mixed reviews out there so I am going to try to be as objective as possible. This book is not a love story or at least not in the sense that everything is perfect and that there are no wrongs in the story line. There are things in this book that Travis does that should be considered unacceptable. He is termpermental and has an anger issue. He is controllive and possesive at times but he is honest when it comes to his feelings about Abby. She becomes his drug. She is the love he never knew he went with out and never expected to feel. He doesn't know how to react when he beleives he is going to lose her. Maybe his reactions are not justified but it reminds me of someone who is given a gift they never knew they needed to survive then it is taken away.   It is the tale of most college romances or many that I have witnessed. Girls fall for the guy they believe everyone wants, the one that will fight for him. Yes Travis fights for Abby but no I don't think it is ok that he attacks anyone that looks her way.   Abby is not without fault herself though. She strings Travis along knowing she loves him then gets mad when she thinks he has moved on.   However, with this said it is a book. From page one McGuire throws you into the story. It is emotional and will play on everything you know is wrong but you feel is so right. You want Travis to protect Abby, to love her and to change for her. You want him to prove everyone they are wrong.  The sexual tension in this book also adds to all the unexpected emotions this read brings about. The McGuire definately hit the nail on the head as far as the exploits and actions that most young people believe will fix everything in their realtionship. I believe readers can realte to the characters because most people have experienced that relationship in which we hurt ourselves in.   Abby wants to be saved from her past while Travis needs to be saved from his future. Travis, Everywhere University's example of every father's nightmare, is the typical use them and leave them college guy. He doesn't show remorse for the women he beds and is to self absorbed to see the destructive path he is following. Then he meets Abby, a good girl from Kansas, or so she presents herself. Abby is running from a past, trying to start over and create the future she believes is best for her. She meets Travis, the cousin of her best friend's boyfriend. She makes a point not to humor him and definately not to become one of his statistics. As fate would have it, he begins to fall for Abby who finds every reason in the book not to let herself love him. Although she is a Pollyana on the outside, her past is s different story and Travis reminds her of everything she is running from.   The two make each other miserable and hurt each other by trying to stay away from each other.   There force is like magnets, when they are together they can't be seperated, but when the wrong ends are near each other the force pushes them in an unnatual direction. I admit in the begining it was as if Travis couldn't live, function or breathe without Abby. It showed the signs of co-dependency most college relationships tend to take on. He became a little scary at times. He was very possesive and controlling of her. He had never learned to love someone after the death of his mom. Abby makes them both miserable because she can't decide if what she feels is worth it. Each of them tries to move on for the other but instead they are just drawn back to one another. They hurt each other more in the process of trying to be happy alone. This may not be your typical love story but if you don't relate to this story and understand it is typical of many relationships then you may be as delusional as Travis and Abby believing they can live without one another.   Finally Travis causes Abby to speak to him after throwing her over his shoulder. Her reaction... \\"You can't tell me what to do Travis, I don't belong to you.\\" He replies simply \\"I belong to you.\\" This was the turning point when she knew she couldn no longer fight what she felt.  As bad and wrong as it may seem, although they hurt each other , I still found myself wanting them to be together. He was wrong in so many ways and you felt you needed her to save him and for him to protect her. I really enjoyed the ending alhtough it was not at all what I expected. Once again I believe in a twisted sort of way, that every person who finds themself in one of these relationships may read this book and think they have a chance at the happy ending. I definately wouldn't want my daughter to read it but that could be because I relate to it. I doubt there is ever a gray area with this book, its going to be a love or hate book from the begining and I must say I loved it! I think it is beautifully written and if nothing else... if McGuire sole purpose in writing this book is to get peopel talking, no matter how you feel she will accomplish that will all readers.  I truly enjoyed this book and would definately recommend it to others! I plan to read it again.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I find this album to be more of an audio book than a music CD. It doesn't feel like something you'd bump in your vehicle, or even something you would listen to with friends. The heaviness and thrash you'll find here from Metallica would love to contradict that, but I still feel it's true.   It's a performance piece by Lou with background Metallica thrash. To me, that means you won't find easy listening or that catchy tune. Expect repetition, it's more about creating a feeling than impressing us with riffs. I don't see failure here, but I definitely don't think it's for everyone.
140053271X|5.0|I looked at both the Kindle and the Nook Simple touch thoroughly before purchasing them. From what I read they are very very similar with some slight variation on details. The inability to download epub files was what drove me to the nook instead of the kindle. Why wouldn't a device primarily built for reading e-books not support the #1 e-book format (.epub)? It only makes sense from a business and money making perspective, not a customer focused perspective.  The only good thing I can say about the Kindle is that it is 100% easier to download library books to it. Using the Adobe Digital software to unlock library books with the nook was a headache at first, and I'm a librarian who is somewhat tech-savy. :D Once you do it once, it's easy to do again, but it is frustrating.  The only other criticism I have about the nook is this: Why bother making it wifi? The only way you can add content to your device (other than purchasing content from B&N) is to hook it up to the computer? :S

1589949811|5.0|Me and my husband collect card games and really enjoy cooperative style games, since I am competitive and am really a sore loser. This is by far our favorite.  I won't go into components or gameplay. This is easy to find in other places. I just want to tell you what I liked:  1) The art is pretty. So much so I decided to sleeve all my cards. Sleeving cards also made card shuffling without bending the cards easier.  2) The game is cooperative. This works well for me and my husband, who sometimes get bitter when we play against each other and one of us loses, of course.  3) The game is solitarily-cooperative in the sense that it is very much of a solataire with some collaborative moments. This keeps controlling type-A me from trying to run the show, which sometimes happens when I play cooperative games. Each person's cards in front of them don't affect anyone else but themselves. Sometimes cards can help other people or the team as a whole, and of course each person helps the overall quest, but I don't feel the need to peep over my husband's sholder to make sure he is making the most of his cards, because oftentimes there is a lot going on with my own hand.  4) Lots of expansions! I personally use the expansions as my own \\"reward\\" system for exersicing and eating healthy (I'm bad at both those things). It's a great non-food reward and for the price, it's great. They come out with a new one every month too. The game shouldn't get boring because of this.  5) The gameplay allows for multiple play-through without getting bored. For example, we also have Pandemic, an awesome multiplayer cooperative game, which has become a hit with the entire extended family (and it's not nerdy). However, after playing through this 10+ times, you get a feel for what a \\"winning\\" strategy is, and then it gets old. LOTR's doesn't get old. The cards are random enough that sometimes you have an enevitable \\"losing\\" game on an easy quest. However, this makes winning all the more fun. Also, with the different decks (or combining decks), play styles change, making the game interesting.  6) Easy set up, easy put away. This is not the case with games such as Arkham Horror, which takes 30 minutes just to shuffle cards and lay them out, 3 hours to play, and then another 30 minutes to put up. It's so easy to just pull out LOTRs, play a 30 minute game, and put it away in 2 mins. This means we play it more often than other games... making it worth the money.  My biggest complaints are   1) The box innerds. There is no good way to store the cards, which is fine if you like a big jumbled mess of cards. I made my own card holders for the box out of foam core to keep everything nicely separated You can find several templates for these at boardgamegeek.com  2) The game is nerdy. If you have non-nerdy friends, it's hard to want to ask them to play. Any game with \\"Hit Points\\" and \\"Attack points\\" is hard for me to want to ask non-nerdy friends to play. But that is the nature of the game.  Overall, if you like board/card games and are a fan of LOTRs, I say this game is worth trying. Even better if you want to play solo games. I've found myself wanting to play, but having no one to play with, and playing either with one deck by myself, or playing two decks at the same time as if there were two people. :)
1451627289|5.0|another good novel of Stephen Kings - can hardly wait to finish.    nice  addition to my collection. this novel is about the assination  of JFK which I remember so well. teacher turned t.v. on in our 5th  grade class to see when it happened. was ten but left that day to go  home with tears in my eyes. He was our president - hoping this book  will erase all that and replace them with something totally King!!!  thank you for this opportunity.

B004EPZ02A|1.0|I went to see this movie in the theater and really was disappointed in it.  I think the main reason that I was so disappointed was the fact that over 80 percent of the trailer was not in the movie and the scenes that were cut were really the reasons why I wanted to go see the movie.  I thought, initially, that there were going to be a lot more questions answered like the fire and what happened to their mother, but this was just a subpar movie with nothing really answered.  There are a few scares and the ending of the movie is pretty messed up but otherwise this movie kind of plays like the others and leaves you with more questions than answers which I thought we were going to get.  Now I fear we may get yet another prequel to the series with PA 4 when really I think most fans just want to find out what went wrong with Katie and her sister, the fire, etc and move on.  I'm curious as to what happened to the baby at the end of PA 2 (will this ever be answered?) and there are some other questions that I have but I don't want to waste time on that.  The movie just wasn't that good due to the trailer scenes being cut and you know something is wrong when, and I'm not joking, when the movie was over people in the audience said, \\"What?  That's it?!\\"  I think it was kind of a bad judgement call from the producers and directors to cut so much of the trailer out of the movie as this is the reason why people come to the movies based off what they see in the trailer.  In the future maybe you should release a plot synoposis and no trailer that way you give people no expectations of the movie.  Oh and to anyone who likes to go to scary movies to jump and yell and act stupid please stay away.  I actually had people in the theater I was in jumping at everything and screaming at everything and I swear there was one guy that was so scared he was ready to walk out.  Really?!!  Grow up and stop ruining movies for everyone else.  That's not really anything about the movie just people in the theater in general and I thought I'd put that out there.  Getting back to the movie though, it was just ok for me.  I think if the producers and director would have not shown too much in a trailer or a finished trailer then this movie would have been good.  I just think most people were a little disappointed that they didn't get to see the fire, the mother dragged down the hall and slammed on the bed, the little girl throwing water at the entity, the girl jumping down the stairs, the entity in the bathroom with the girls as they play bloody mary, the dad play the knocking game at the closet and the medium or preacher or whatever he is getting his head slammed off the table and pulled backward, etc.  I think if they wouldn't have shown these parts in the trailer then they wouldn't have gotten people's hopes up and ultimatly squashed them.  Next time show us a finished trailer so we know what we're getting.  Hopefully PA 4 will be better.  Hopefully!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game has quite a variety of zombies, who are even represented by counsel.  The achievements provide for added fun.  I wish you could jump right into quick play immediately, but that might make the game too easy.
1400069181|5.0|The holidays are the perfect time to think about giving, and New Year is when thoughts turn to self-improvements.  If you want a little inspiration to help kick-start you on both, I highly recommend reading Start Something that Matters by Blake Mycoskie, the creator and \\"Chief Shoe Giver\\" of TOMS shoes.    Mycoskie, who had no background in footwear or even retail, started TOMS as a way to help provide shoes for children in developing countries.  Inspired by a trip to Argentina, he was able to donate 10,000 pairs of shoes to Argentine children the within a year.  With his \\"One for One\\" model, the company has become one of the fastest-growing footwear companies in the world, and is, unlike many other companies, a for-profit company that has built giving into its DNA.  The book is filled with stories, not only about TOMS, but about other companies who are doing things \\"that matter.\\"  Through their inspiring stories, you learn the importance of having your own story, facing your fears and being resourceful without resources.    No one can deny that TOMS shoes has been successful, both as a for-profit company, and as one doing good in the world, so their story is one that many will be inspired to try to duplicate.  The book offers a blueprint for channeling enthusiasm and limited resources to create something that can grow.  A very inspirational and quick read, this book should be required reading for anyone wants to make a difference in the world.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. One of the first apps I got for my Fire. You get weather specifics like humidity and wind chill. If you don't have it you should try it.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|This is the ZZ Top greatest hits album to buy.  I absolutely love it.  Billy Gibbons has one of the dirtiest blues rock guitar sounds you will ever hear, and this lets all of his great work shine.  Not to mention the chops of the rest of the band.<br /><br />It has all the popular songs plus a ton of other gems that really make you appreciate their work.  And great songs like Waitin' for the Bus (Have Mercy) -> Jesus Just Left Chicago that other ZZ Top greatest hits albums don't have.  Worth every penny.  A definite must buy if you like rock/blues!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Had forgotten how funny the muppets are. Loved this movie not to mention the cringeworthy outfits that were in style then! Great funny family entertainment.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is definitely by far one of the best Drama shows on TV. Season 2 was a little disappointing with the Porn business and all (it almost kept me from following the story line), but fortunately season three brought me out of my shell and now I'm glued to it since and can't wait for season five. We started rewatching the series from the beginning and getting more out of the charactors and their roles in the club. The Finales of season 3 & 4 are to be watched over a few time to really get the punch in the stomach on what a great show this is.
B005G4TJUC|1.0|Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011. I found this movie disrespectful to the true Transformer fans and see this regurgitation as a middle finger from Micheal Bay to all of us. If your a True Transformer fan stay away.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Way back in the 60's there was a show called \\"Star Trek\\". I was a kid then and it had a great affect on my life and on many others as well. Movies, cartoons, books sprouted up after the show was abruptly and obviously wrongly cancelled ... probably for being too subversive and intelligent. As good as I remember it to be as a child, the original series is dated and simple. Originally it was billed as an adult science fiction drama if I recall right but it is almost unwatchable anymore because it is so simple and slow moving and single-threaded.  Still, I am sentiment, just realistic about that original series.  My affection for Star Trek had me going to movies and eventually watching spin-off series, one after the other, until I just lost interest as it got to be too commercial. Most of the Next Generation shows were too staid and politically correct for me, dry and preachy and too campy. There was one excellent episode I think was entitled \\"The Flute\\" that stood the test of time. But I lost interest and stopped caring about Star Trek after a while. Then came \\"Deep Space Nine\\", \\"Voyager\\", and finally \\"Enterprise\\". By the time \\"Enterprise\\" came along I considered it commerical \\"kid stuff.\\"  When the \\"Star Trek\\" movie reboot showed up it was great eye candy, but it just made me mad it was so far from the original vision of Gene Roddenberry and so brain dead and just stupid.  Well ... thank to streaming video NetFlix and Amazon I have had the chance without a major investment in time and money to sample \\"Enterprise\\". The first episodes of the first season were pretty much what I expected and more or less the same predictable formula of the franchise. But a funny thing happened over time as I watched the episodes develop, the show got into a pace, and it was more raw, more honest, less politically correct, less preachy, and by the second season - it was damn good.  The first season is good, but I almost did not keep up watching it. Something happened in the second season, particularly with the episode \\"Cogenitor\\" that showed me the series had writers that were not afraid to dive into tough issues, with thoughtful and excellent writing.  \\"Enterprise\\" is excellent. Certainly it will never have the same effect on me that the original series had as a kid, but I think it is better than the original series, though not quite as comedic, it meets the criterion of an adult science fiction drama. It's really good, and congratulations to the actors, effects makers, writers and directors for doing a f-ing excellent job of bringing Star Trek back to life. The whole cast is great and the stories are much fun yet the stories as serious and human but still do not take themselves too seriously. Just a wonderful experience to se this ... and my only regret is that I did not give it a chance and add to \\"Enterprise's\\" ratings when it was on. This show has every indication that it had plenty of adventures to go and a lot of good ideas and thought provoking statements.  As I approach the finishing of the 4th season I find myself sorry that it is coming to an end and wanting more. I would not jump at the chance to see another Star Trek series franchise if it was anywhere as good as \\"Enterprise\\". Thanks \\"Enterprise\\" - GREAT JOB. 4/5 for season 1, but 5/5 for the rest of the seasons.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|As other reviewers have noted, the most recent Kindle for Android update has caused a massive increase in the amount of memory utilized by the applciation.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|This item is everything it says it is. It is very lightweight which is good since the Fire is a bit heavier than most ereaders. It also appears to be well-made. The flap that bends to support the Fire in landscape worked perfectly out of the box - no need to break it in so that it would stay put. Love this cover!!
0307891372|4.0|I love strategy guides. Even if I don't use them much I enjoy reading them, especially for such in-depth games as Skyrim.  I don't often write reviews, but I thought I'd give my opinion on this guide after about 50 hours into Skyrim.  There is a lot of information in this guide, but much of it is not really organized very well. There is an index, but some of the things I am trying to reference are not in it.  This is a huge game and don't get me wrong, I have gotten some very useful information from this guide. I just wish it flowed a little better and answered some more questions, like where is the best loot, etc... There is a long section on character suggestions, which is completely useless, as any character can be played any way you want in this game.  I loved the Prima Fallout 3 guide and was expecting something along those lines, but inevitably this fell a little short of my expectations. It does have some great info, but suffers from poor organization. I have found myself going to online sources more than this guide.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Very very impressed with the speed of this being delivered via UPS. I honestly didn't think they would be able to get it out of the warehouse in less than 12 hours, but they did! I ordered this for my boyfriend, had one previously, no issues. Would reccomend this seller/product to any of my friends.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I loved this film and wanted it on dvd. I was worried that it had been totally remastered, maybe it wouldn't be the same?? But i'm happy to say it made all the difference to the movie! The dvd was delivered quickly and new as described so in all i'm very pleased.
B004EPZ084|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time! We were almost literally falling on the floor laughing.<br />Watched it twice in a row and I know we'll watch it time and time again and laugh just as much. It's that funny.
0307454541|4.0|It took forever to get into. Very dry at parts and I sometimes would confuse people since names were so similar. Last 100 pages are great though and worth the wait.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|Well nevermind about the UltraViolet Digital Copy. The Movie was pretty good and I kinda liked it better than the first movie. Yes I have read all the bad and good reviews and the only suggestion I can make to you is to buy it and figure it out yourself. I know a lot of people do not have the same likes and dislikes in movies. I happen to love watching movies and this one was good. If you liked the 1st movie you will of course love watching this one as well and it will make you laugh. I even want to watch it again this weekend.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Being a commuter for my job, I enjoy audio books.  I listened to Tina read this book.  It was SO funny that once I had to turn it off for a few minutes because I was just laughing way to hard to drive.<br /><br />I haven't enjoyed a book this laugh-out-loud funny in years.  Thank you, Tina Fey.  Just this week I practiced the \\"Irish Good-night\\" with some friends who wouldn't leave........still laughing!
B0052YAKS6|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD... I HAVE HEARD OF DAVID GUETTA BUT I WASN'T SURE IF I WOULD PLAY THIS CD IN MY CAR.. THE SINGLE... WITHOUT YOU (SINGLE WRITTEN BY USHER) IS THE MAIN REASON I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THIS CD.<br /><br />WOW! I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST CDS OF 2011 - AND I KNOW I WILL BE PLAYING THIS CD FOR YEARS TO COME. THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE ON THIS CD....  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS GETTING MOTIVATED TO EXERCISE OR WALK ON YOUR TREADMILL - PUT THIS CD ON.. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP MOVING...<br /><br />ORSAYOR
0767903862|4.0|I read this after a month long Australian trip. It was a gift from my Australian friends. This is not just a travelog. It is full of Australian history, politics and facts all very interesting and often funny. So not only do you get an  account of the authors travels. You also get a sort of condensed australian almanac and a long list of things that will kill you while visiting there. Bryson has a feeling for the Australian mindset. He is not afraid to write about the Aboriginal issue but does not bore you with a lot of diatribe. I would recomend this book to anyone with an interest in Australia. And if you are not interested in that continent I can guarantee you will be after reading the book.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game just loads a black screen when trying to play it.  Please update the app to work on the Galaxy Nexus!
0792836502|4.0|Shipment was received earlier than promised and was as described.  I have enjoyed watching this movie and would deal with this vendor again.
1401219268|5.0|I got to say that I was impressed both by the quality of the product and the time of arrival (I live in Brazil). And the product itself, just great!. I adore the way that they explore the phsychological part of what it is to have powers, and how everyone would response to this. Anyway, I'm totally satisfied, and I recomend!!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I liked this movie well enough the first time I saw it years back, but it didn't really strike me as a great film. It was entertaining and complex but not complicated or hard to follow. It didn't try to be more than what it is. It certainly didn't judge or preach.<br /><br />A year ago I rented this movie as I wrapped Christmas presents and REALLY enjoyed it all the more. This year, I decided to purchase it and loved it more this third or fourth time than I did that first time (which I don't think was during the holiday season). I'm watching it a second time this Christmas season, and it's really become a holiday favorite even though it's not technically a \\"Christmas movie\\".<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe Reader is one of the most reliable wares that I own. I have it on all of my computers and devices. It will not disappoint.
0451228375|3.0|I just finished World Without End and simply have to ask: was I the only person who felt this was just a weak rewrite of POTE? We've got the young but brilliant builder, the headstrong, surprisingly modern love interest, the evil man (struggling to achieve a higher status) raping and killing left and right, the unscrupulous monk(s)/prior(s), the big project the builder is working on that we all know will be finished in the last few pages of the book.... The plague and mysterious letter story lines were weak and didn't add enough variety to the book to justify how similar it was to POTE. I wasn't a huge fan of POTE, but still, it was stronger than this one. In World Without End, the characters seemed...thinner and paler. They were weak copies of Jack Builder, Aliena, etc. Not to mention all of the bad characters were pretty much 99.9% evil, which is something that rarely occurs in the real world. I prefer my villains to be a little more fleshed out and realistic. All in all, a bit of a boring read, especially with the never-ending sex scenes. I'm not a prude who's against sexuality, but really, it got to be too much. Not to mention, some of the scenes were just unintentionally funny, like the scene where the main character thinks of his wife's perfect breasts only minutes after finding out she's dead. Really? Your wife died and one of the first things you remember about her is her breasts? That's borderline creepy, although I had a good laugh over it. I don't think I would have minded the sex scenes as much if they had been written a tad better.  Overall, I would encourage those who are interested in reading the book to go ahead and read it, but I would caution that you may not love it as much as you expected to.
B000ICM5MG|4.0|Was looking for a new copy of Rocky.  Found it easily and paid for it easily.  Quality is good along with interesting bonus disk about the cast and making of the film.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a great keyboard, and I like it much better than Swype, but I don't like how the period (.) is so close to the spacebar, and the past few months I will press a button and it will stay highlighted, and not be input into my screen.  That seems to have started happening in the last update, and  it really bothers me.  Other than that, it is pretty good at predictions, especially if you have it re-learn every now and again.
B003CCAIGO|5.0|Jimi Hendrix / Valleys of Neptune (Single - two song CD):  This single is better than the \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" album.  This single has `valleys' and a seven minute unreleased version of \\"Peace in Mississippi\\" that is better than everything else on the 12 track album.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Like everyone has said before me, the graphics are AMAZING on my Motorola Xoom. However, as soon as you start to get into the game, it's over.<br /><br />If you like Professor Layton's on Nintendo DS then you would like this game. I guess it reminded me so much of Layton that I was expecting it to be longer.<br /><br />This is just a taste of an actual game, like maybe an inning of a baseball game. Not even an inning. Just one side up to bat.<br /><br />If this was longer, I'd give it 5/5. But I would expect to only devote an hour or less to play the whole game. Just as long as you realize that, you won't be disappointed.
B000002UCQ|5.0|George Harrison / All Things Must Pass (Original 2 CD set):  Having heard the new box set, I can only say that I hate most of the added material.  Stay with this Original set.  The original is Great, yet even it should have been paired down to a single album.  With all that being said, this may be the best of all the post Beatles albums.  Even with its flaws, this is a Great release.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I love friends and thats why i bought this! The only thing is, i wouldve liked more bloopers and it takes so long to ship!!!! lol but it was worth it, i watch it all the time! It has good quality and is great for any collector.
B003162R7E|5.0|Jimi Hendrix / First Rays of the New Rising Sun (CD):  Through the huge number of older posthumous releases, we have heard nearly everything on this CD already, but with this CD, we finally get a true idea of what that next Hendrix album MIGHT have consisted of.  That is not to say that this CD does not have problems, indeed, they purposely do not attempt to `blend' the songs into an album (as the previous \\"Voodoo Soup\\" album attempted to do) but leaves the finished and unfinished cuts as they are.  This gives us a sense of the theme Jimi had in mind, and at the same time, it gives us an accurate sense that, if Jimi had lived, the album would have gone through several more changes and would not have been exactly what we have here.  If you are a fan of Hendrix's music, but are not one of those who are looking to buy every note ever released, this may be the one album to buy after you have bought \\"Are You Experienced\\" (1967), \\"Axis: Bold as Love\\" (1967), and \\"Electric Ladyland\\" (1968).  As an album, this CD rates five stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I totally love this version of the game! it has so many different options to customise the game for a better gaming  experience... enjoy
B000002GFT|4.0|Fairport Convention: Liege & Lief:  It is always a joy to hear a Fairport Convention album.  Their fine rendition of \\"Tam Lin\\" is the best cut here.  The rest of the album is enjoyable and rates four stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The games are fun and basic which I like. There are too many app pop ups but its expected for a free app.
B000002A70|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel / Bridge Over Troubled Water (Gold disc): If you don't have this album, you need to get it.  This is among the greatest albums of all time.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is a series I was kind of hesitant about. It's odd story had kept me from watching it but I found it cheap on Amazon so I went for it. Best decision I've made in some time. Great acting, unique story, great character development. Must have for any TV fanatic.
B000001EG6|5.0|Elton John (Self-titled) / (with Bonus Tracks):  Although Three Dog Night had already released their own version of \\"Your Song\\", it was this original version that caught the radio listeners.  In buying the album they discovered a collection of great songs, and the success of John/Taupin in the States was virtually guaranteed from that moment.  This is a five-star album.
B003L77GGK|4.0|I was very excited to finally start watching season six (I like to stay a season behind so that I can watch them all at once) and was very excited that Sera Gamble was taking over. After watching the first two episodes, I was worried, I hated those episodes, they were super boring and I found myself not really caring what happened to my beloved boys (I know right?!!! It's an awful thing to say! But I truly did not care).  I actually went a month before forcing myself to watch the next two episodes and was feeling like I was kinda done with the series. Then in episode 6 (SPOILER ALERT!!) when we see Sam allow Dean to get turned into a vampire it started to suck me back in again, and it only got better from there.  I ended up really enjoying the season and loved some of the plot twists with the angels and demons.  Over all it was a good season, it picked up nicely, it just wasn't great!
B00005A8MA|5.0|John Mayall / Back To The Roots (Two CD set - Remastered 1971 original album plus, as bonus cuts, Eight remixed versions from the 1988 \\"Archives to Eighties\\" release):<br /><br />Here are the other musicians on this album; Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Harvey Mandel, Keef Hartley, Sugarcane Harris, Jerry McGee, Johnny Almond, Larry Taylor, Paul Lagos, and Steve Thompson.<br /><br />Among the songs are, \\"Accidental Suicide\\" which John wrote about the death of Jimi Hendrix.  Both Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor play on this cut, which makes it an extraordinary session and an extremely good song as well.  \\"Prisons on the Road\\", if you drive, you have one.  \\"Television Eye\\", about media brainwashing.  \\"Groupie Girl\\" about, well, you know.  \\"Mr. Censor Man\\" is, or course, about censorship.  These and every other cut on this album are superb.<br /><br />Speaking of censorship, one of the things that this double CD set does Not do is reproduce the original LP book.  That book was wonderful but it did have one pornographic drawing in it and so the produces of this CD decided Not to reproduce it.  Mr. Censor Man still lives.<br /><br />This is a Masterpiece album.  This is early 1970's Blue-eyed blues and social commentary at its very best, with the very best musicians of the era.  This is one you ought to own. It deserves a Sixth Star.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a really good movie. Everyone should watch it. It is very enjoyable. I think I'll watch it again.
B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles / Let it Be:  Yes, the sessions were a mess.  Yes, Phil overproduced it.  Yes, it is an odd collection of tunes.  Yes, Billy Preston stepped in to make them at least be polite to one another, and then happened to save the album.  Yes, this is The Beatles \\"Let it Be\\" album, and it's still better than what most bands produce.  So let it be.  This is a five star album.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I had never watched an episode of Sex and the City since I didn't have HBO.  From all the people who loved the show raving about it, I decided to buy the complete giftset for myself and check it out.  I'm so glad I did!  I found myself watching episode after episode!  I didn't have any DVD problems and each DVD played smoothly.
B004NCOQCE|3.0|Jimi Hendrix / South Saturn Delta: This is not an essential album.  There are some interesting things here as well as some poor recordings that were obviously never intended to see the light of day.  It is interesting only to the Hendrix Fan (which I am) but overall this is not a very good album.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Journalist Julia Jarmond relentless search to find out what happen to a little Jewish girl and her younger brother.She had her younger brother to hide in the closet and keeps the key when the french round up Jews for Hitler.In the end she Finds out the fate of Sarah and her brother,I don't want to give the answer to their fate away, it would give some suspense away from the movie.She also finds Sarah's Son who does't know his mother was a Jew.This Movie should be nominated for an academy award,but i will tell you that about half the movie is subtitled in English an in a foreign language French,the other half is in English.
B00328G4V6|3.0|Jimi Hendrix / Valleys of Neptune: It is nice to have a clean version of \\"Neptune\\" at last, but it is obvious that the well has run dry for Hendrix releases.  Some good stuff among some poor recordings and some things better left on the shelf.  Hendrix was great, but if this CD represents the best of what is left, there will be no desire to buy any future `finds'.
B00631VJIC|3.0|Of all the great music that has played these 4 seasons, I'm pretty disappointed in their selection.  About half of the music is pretty good, the rest is not so good.  Katey Sagal makes the CD worthwhile tho.  What a talented woman she is.
B0009P5YXO|1.0|What i ordered was the tenth doctors sonic screwdriver that extended with uv light,sound,and 2 different pen caps what i recieved was a tenth doctor sonic screwdriver flashlight with no pen and from the package discription no sound as i wouldnt be able to tell because it was cracked and doesn't do anything.
B001CFLHJA|5.0|I listened to this CD for 2 months straight after receiving it. Great music. Very innovative. Nice tunes ! great improvisors ! A+
B000002LOE|4.0|Time for me to be contentious. Why do I like this album so much? I don't think Michael Stipe has a great singing voice. But the backing singer Mike Mills has a fantastic voice. And his voice is in much prominence here. Listen to his singing of 'shiny happy people', he has a much purer voice than Michael. Listen to the lead vocals he does on the fantastic 'near wild heaven', what a beautiful harmonious song. He also sings on 'Texarkana' and it is another good track. I also love the instrumental 'endgame' an excellent track with interesting instrumentation. When looking on wikipedia, it doesn't surprise me that Mike was the main songwriter behing REM's two best songs ever: Nightswimming and Find the river.  As for the weaker tracks on the album: Low doesn't go anywhere and is just depressingly kind of shallow with out of tune vocals. 'Country feedback' much of the same. It sounds rambling and tuneless to me. 'Me in honey' is also horrible. The same riff over and again, but without any kind of inventiveness. No tune to this one either.   Bring on more Mike Mills vocals!
B000065U1N|3.0|An absolutely great, well-made film about a tragedy ... in spite of the fact that there wasn't a performance by ANY of the actors playing officers in this film that I believed.  Including the Captains out on the street.  And Sam Shepard chewing gum with his t-shirt on and wearing sunglasses in the JOC.  You have GOT to be kidding me.    Yes, I was in the military so I'm going to be a harsher critic of actors playing military officers.  But there are plenty, plenty of performances by actors who play military officers well.  Shepard just didn't convince me.  And I don't think his performance would have convinced me even if I had not been in the military ... his words, his tone, his demeanor, his concerns, his reactions - either he didn't fully understand how that character would react in that situation, or he was miscast in the role.  I think the latter.  And likely poorly directed.  Ignoring that, otherwise a great, great film.  All the young actors ... tragically effective in their portrayal of that incredibly unfortunate situation.
B0041B4H1M|4.0|I bought this item from Amazon and i recieved it in great condition and it arrived weeks before scheduled. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to buy from this site.
030746363X|5.0|This is an encyclopedia, not to be read from cover to cover. I found several things that have helped me, all worth much more than the price of the book. I started the slow carb eating, lost 25 lbs, and got a new job requiring a physical, which I passed with flying colors thanks to my new eating habits. Kettle bells? Great item, and that is a new habit as well. Great book for your Kindle...the print edition is a doorstop! Enjoy!!
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|New, in plastic wrapping, like I'd just bought it at the store when it first came out.  It was in new condition and timely shipping.  Thank you.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I have a kindle fire and bought about $20 worth of natural music before I found this app! if u play the thunderstorm screensaver w/ the sleepy time thunderstorm sounds its really cool. or the beach sounds w/ the fish screensaver to look @ while u drift off is nice.
0393064476|5.0|Even though I haven't personally read this book, I give it a rave review for the timely manner in which it was received and for the price. Another satisfied customer and gift idea. my mom loved the gift! :)
B005KELQEU|5.0|I like the light padding, the pleather panels, and the dual zippers.....keeps my kindle protected and accessible.  Be aware; it is for storing/carrying your kindle....you have to remove it from the sleeve to access the kindle.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie is a favorite of my daughter's. I purchased this for her birthday in October of this year. She has then since watched it numerous times.<br />I am thrilled with the service I received for this item. It was the right price and arrived in plenty of time for my daughter to open and enjoy her birthday present. :)<br />This movie is a very inspirational and great family movie. I'm glad my daughter enjoys this so much!
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome game that is hard to put down...you can not go wrong with solitaire...you must download if you like card games
B005K17RU0|1.0|got it installed, no problem. Got initial location weather and forecasts,  sweet ! went to a different town,  it remained in the first town and would not locate current town. got frustrated and uninstalled it. definitely has issues with getting locations.
0439023513|3.0|I absolutely LOVED the first book in this trilogy.  The character development, the insight, the details, all fascinating, I couldn't put it down.  This trilogy started going downhill with the second book, Catching Fire, then totally collapsed with Mockingjay.<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />The book began with some promise, a new life in 13, the past, etc.  But I never felt connected with Katniss the way I had in the other books.  Sure, she's shell-shocked, but goes through long periods of time being drugged up, unresponsive, uncomprehending, etc etc. and Collins takes the time to describe every boring detail of these periods.  The final 1/3 of the book seems cheap, like Collins needed to come up with an ending.  Main characters are killed off with no purpose, the plot stops, then goes again, then stops.<br /><br />When it ends, it seems like Collins took the easy way out of the long love triangle and political thriller she's weaved, and we don't know if things are better now or worse for the people of Panem.  I was hoping for and expecting more.  I don't know how the heck they're going to do this one as a movie.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Before I bough this item I read some of the reviews and the video availble from 3Dgameman.com. I received yesterday. I took out of the box and it was easy as 3Dgameman showed in his video (hate those plastics box that you have to cut open). I right way want to test and see how it works, so when my husband open on Christmas day, he can enjoy right away. I connected to my computer to charge what didn't take long. I followed the quick instructions to pairing with my phone. And it was easy. I made one call to check the sound and it was great. I am very pleased with this prodcut. I am thinking to buy one for myself now. But it is true what Dean! from Dallas, TX says. This product does not have a call id so you need to look into your phone screen. But I am not the kind of person that will buy the top products with all the features that human minds can fit in a device because I don't want to pay for it. So for me it is perfect and look in my phone screen it is not an inconvinence. It is better than what my hubby and I do now that is drive holding the phone and be distracted. I give this product a 5 star because it is a very good product for the price.
630289915X|5.0|The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would buy from this provider again, because their product description was adequately stated.
0756686970|5.0|My 4 year old loves all of the Lego video games and movies so when he seen this he asked for it for Christmas. He loved it! he can't read but he does not care he looks at every page and just loves to see all the guys and there are so many pictures on EVERY page and info that he just loves it!
B004ZNACA6|1.0|First of all, the music is excellent (it IS Pink Floyd after all), the sound quality is great, BUT...  The first review on the product page states that the CD's come in Digi-packs.  Wrong!  They come in faux album sleeves without so much as a paper or plastic liner for protection!  The book of art that comes with it is nothing big and after thumbing throught it once, you'll probably never touch it again.  The box itself is nice enough but as with almost every 'box-set' box if you want to use it you'll need a special place to store it as it won't fit well on an ordinary CD rack.    So if you buy this, I suggest that you buy some CD liners or jewel cases as well.  Unless you like scuffed discs, you're going to need them.
B00275EGWY|1.0|As a veteran, I am constantly amused (or dismayed) by Hollywood's depiction of military soldiers.  All wrong, most all the time.  'nuff said.
0439796644|5.0|I liked this book. I know it is written for young people but that is what made it fun to read cause it was short and had big letters
B005L38QK2|4.0|While I could do without the Diablo III branding, I'm sure that will be a selling point for fans of the game. For me, the best features of this mouse are the excellent tracking, well designed buttions and sizing of the mouse itself. I really found movement to be smooth. The housing is strong and doesn't get slippery with use. This mouse lights up in a dark room which I don't find particularly useful. The cord is extremely thick and durable.
0740785508|3.0|As far as I'm concerned, this book is simply an addendum to James Gurney's \\"Color and Light\\" (see my review-comments for the latter elsewhere)--if you regard both books as instructional treatises for would-be artists. The latter had much more to say and covered a wide range of material, whereas this comes across as more of a \\"commentary\\" rather than painterly instruction on the subject. Is this book of value on its own? Only in the sense that its author's insights are worthwhile, in any format.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|I liked this movie. Not AS good as the first of course. But really, it's called the Hangover PART ll? What were you expecting?! I didn't mind that it was a lot like the first one, but did wish they had a tad more originality in it. Other than that, great job! Crude, funny and outrageous? Yup, that's this right here! Oh yeah, and my digital copy is for iTunes since I got mine in Canada. Baha!
0740797719|5.0|The book is extremely informative, based on years of accumulated learning and hands-on art experience--insights verified not merely by personal experience or interpretation of \\"old truths\\" but contemporary scientific data from fields adjacent to but not directly affiliated with art per se, e.g., optics. Do I totally agree with all the author recommends, especially regarding the examples of color wheels he includes for instruction? No--not because his examples are wrong but because there's more to color theory application à la color wheels than Mr. Gurney seems to imply for artistic usage, namely, for instance, color bias and/or temperature--but in all fairness, mixing color paints with any accuracy entails myriad experimentation and even greater difficulty to explain simply in book-form. All-in-all, a highly instructional treatise for more than just the so-called \\"realist\\" painter.
B004NSVF7C|5.0|I confess, I love books.  My \\"Library Thing\\" account lists over 1,000 and I just keep adding.  This story, however, is about an obsession that takes a criminal turn.  I was amazed, at the start, at the world of \\"first editions\\" and rare book collections.  (That is a very different type collection than mine.)  Books valued at thousands and hundreds of thousands dollars!  The true story follows a journalist who interviews and becomes part of the life of a rare book thief.  We can hope her story will help book sellers prevent some losses, and help the rest of us understand how precious each book is - not just first editions.  A mesmerizing read, in the end, truth is stranger than fiction.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Gives more opportunities to solve while still maintaining the challenge of traditional solitaire. Keeps you glued to the game while at the same time allowing for solutions in fast time. Addictive, fun and stimulating.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This story had me hooked from the beginning.  I read it straight through in one day.  A great sense of mystery and adventure.  Would be a great read for young adults as well.

0071636080|5.0|Well, it's quite interesting book, that provides lots of information and advices, but guys, don't expect your presentation to be the best just after reading this book. There's a lot of suggestion you gotta foresee.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Great new take on some old favorites as well as exciting new songs determined to make their way onto the list of Christmas favorites at Amazon.com. Michael Buble doesn't disappoint this time, either!
0439023491|3.0|This was a fantastic series. The first book is by far the best, but I couldn't put this book down halfway through. It is well worth the read.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|A must have in areas with unpredictable weather.  It auto updates every hour but you can manually update also for up to the minute forecasts.  I like the hour by hour forecasts and the &quot;feel like&quot; temperature in addition to the actual temperature.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Nice convenience features, very easy to configure and easy to play... what more do you want?  I recommend it highly!
B0061S0A64|4.0|Very fun to play around with when you want to tap into your creative side. Nodes and generators are customizable. shuts down on my Fire after about ten minutes, without sleep mode on, obvious glitches in the app. would recommend to anyone, from young to old.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought my wife a Kindle Fire for her birthday. She was so happy with it. And she uses it a LOT. She loves getting books instantly. She is also delighted with how much free stuff there is to read and video to watch. She loves Deep Space Nine and she can watch episodes for FREE.<br /><br />She has found the Fire easy to use, plenty fast, good battery life, she disagrees with the negative reviews of it. She said that she wanted an e-reader with some web access and this fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />I also bought her a case for the Fire and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />Frankly, it made her so happy that I am delighted with the purchase.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI
B004DSPRJO|4.0|I recently broke my foot & none of my shoes were fitting properly on the broken one.  Every other shoe I looked at was either a summer shoe (it's winter), sneakers, or two million dollars!  I decided to finally buy the ugliest shoe in America THE CROC & they are really comfy.  I just got them so time will tell if they are going to be in my future repertoire but for now, they fit!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I just saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes film.  It was an impressive debut to a much maligned franchise film. The film starts with a scientist who is on the edge of discovering a cure for Alzheimer's disease. John Litgow portrays his ailing father. Although his role is understated and small; it contributes to the main plot.  Going against the policy of the corporation, the doctor injects his father with the new serum.  He miraculously gets better and improves in his cognitive ability.  Caesar, the ape that he tested for the cure, is becoming increasingly super intelligent.<br /><br />Almost the entire film focuses on  Caesar's rise to power. Under a different studio, this film might have been very gratuitous and violent.  It has enough over the top action to carry the film, yet it's restrained in it's use of violence. Caesar's first spoken word is \\"No!\\", when he orders his  troops not to harm others.  It has an epic scope that wasn't possible in the early films.  With CGI, an ape army of thousands can be seen running down the Golden Gate Bridge at rush hour.  There was a good resolution and future to the franchise after this movie. I'd like to see the director helm the next segment in this compelling series.<br /><br />I have such clear memories of the first five movies. I wasn't old enough to watch them in the theater.  However, watching them on TV, made me a life long fan.  The TV series in 1974 only ran for thirteen episodes before it was cancelled. Roddy McDowell who portrayed Cornelius in the film, returned to play a character called Galen in the series.  Roddy brought a respectability to a show that was constantly dismissed by critics.  Mark Leonard, took the role of General Urko of the secret police force in Ape City.<br />I purchased the show on DVD five years ago.  It's scripts had good life lessons a morality tales that made a huge impression on me as a child.<br /><br />The late 90's version of Planet of the Apes directed by Tim Burton, pales in comparison to this recent update.  If you get the opportunity to see Burton's movie; you'll see he didn't have a good vision on the franchise.  It was more about costumes and atmosphere.  The story logic didn't follow the previously established mythology.<br /><br />Planet of the Apes fan since 1968on to this recent update.

3836503050|5.0|I was at the book store one day, and this caught my eye. I picked it up on a whim, found a seat and read it. I read the entire thing. It is so wonderful, the literature is great. But I the pictures are what really got me interested in it. They are high quality breath taking prints. I absolutely adored it so much I bought it right there. One of my favorite books!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The app works great on my Zoom.  I tried other solitaire apps, and like this the most.  It has continuous Vegas scoring making it more. enjoyable.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This film is a must see for comedy lovers of all ages!  The banter between Grant and Hepburn is hilarious and the supporting actors are no less fun to watch.  I highly recommend 'Bringing Up Baby' to anyone who needs a good laugh.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Sultry and unique voice.  A true start.  I am glad that she came out with this CD.  Have been waiting for it for so long.  I love \\"Our day will come\\", \\"Between the cheats\\", \\"Like smoke\\", \\"Half time\\", \\"Best Friends, right?\\", \\"Tears Dry (original version\\", \\"Your songs\\" and her version of \\"Will you still love me tomorrow\\".  I could feel her emotions listening to her album.  Exceeded my expectation.  Amy, you will be missed forever.  Thanks for your music...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started using on my smart phone to take notes in meeting so I didn't  have to carry paper and pen. I now have an Kindle Fire and use in the same way.

B001DDBCUA|5.0|I love this movie. I felt the show ended quite well, and this was a great addition. It felt like watching a marathon of the show.
0762434279|5.0|When I bought this, I thought I was buying the full version. But in fact I find this a great little tool to use when growing my business. Its quick, to the point, and it really opens peoples minds to do something better about their financial situations. <...>
0802473156|1.0|Me and my fiance sat down and read this book just for the heck of it. After about 30 minutes of reading we were both bored of it. For me I was turned off even by the first chapter.   \\"Books abound on the subject. Television and radio talk shows deal with it. The internet is full of advice. So are our parents and friends. Keeping love alive in our marriages is serious business. With all the help available from media experts, why is it that so few couples seem to have found the secret to keeping love alive after the wedding?\\"  Chapman basically goes on to say that his book has the answer, the \\"truth we're missing.\\" Great. Just what we've all been waiting for...  And then it doesn't get interesting.  If I had skipped the first chapter maybe I would have gotten through the book and thought \\"oh that was nice I guess.\\" but that would be the best I could say about it.

B0056BMK6K|1.0|I wasn't impressed with this ebook. I revealed very little, if anything, of value. I have read far better books on this subject. The guy might be making plenty of money but he is keeping his real secrets to himself.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Just received the cover from Amazon. 1. The straps are not too tight or too loose. Perfectly fine, and easy to get on. 2. It's slightly larger then the Kindle which is a good thing since it now won't be so easy to inadvertently push the on-off button on the device. 3. True it doesn't close absolutely flat but expect it will do so with use, but it's still close enough. 4. One review refers to the magnetic clasp not working - have no fear, there is no magnetic clasp. 5. 4 stars because it's a bit expensive. I'm happy I got it though.

B001RCD2DW|2.0|I'd like to meet the guy who designed the headband at the top of these headphones and ask him \\"what were you thinking?\\".  The headband is made from hard leather which has some padded dimples embossed into it.  The entire weight of the headphones is supported by only two of the dimples on top of your head.  These dimples dug into my skull after about an hour.  Now 5 days later I can't even handle 10 minutes of wear because of the pain they cause.  The sound is good, flat, but unremarkable.  When I received the headphones, one of the foam ear cushions had come off the headphones during transit.  Fortunately it was simple to re-attach it.  Overall, not what I'd expect from headphones of this price and caliber.

B001V7P2W2|5.0|Saw this film in an art house and liked it so much I bought dvd. Captures the atmosphere of the era just before the annexation of Austria by the Nazis. Imposed on this is a gripping mountaineering story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The tradgedy of the story seems preiscent considering the massive tradgedy that is about to unfold upon Europe.
B005AUWY2W|4.0|The story was good, and will probably captivate adults even better than the first, but a bit convoluted and sensational.  You would expect this from an animated flick, but not necessarily in the context of the downhome story of the first.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|It's hard to even begin to convey how excellent this album is, except to say - simply awesome (I know that word is overused, but here it is definitely appropriate). As a musician/guitarist myself, I've always been a huge fan of Steve's playing, even though in his Genesis years, his playing was often decidedly understated and always under appreciated. But even as a young guitarist just starting out back in '74, I realized there was something special about his playing that really spoke to me musically, and I've considered him one of my main influences ever since (along with Gilmour, Clapton, Knopfler, Garcia, Ackerman and Howe).<br /><br />For anyone not familiar with Steve Hackett's playing, IMO he has the melodic sensitivity and feel of a David Gilmour or Mark Knopfler, along with the technical prowess and speed of Alan Holdsworth's \\"shredding\\" or Robert Fripp's \\"tapping\\". Just an all around phenom on guitar, but without all of the unnecessary pomp and flash of many of his contemporaries. Every note he plays is purposeful and structured, and always adds to the overall phrasing and/or feel of the music at hand. He is also an accomplished classical guitarist, and often intertwines his classical influences with his hair raising electric work (mostly on what looks to be a customized Fernandes \\"Les Paul\\"). And while many of the other greats of his generation seam to be winding down and mellowing out, Hackett just seems to get better, stronger, faster, and more impressive with age. That goes for his playing and his songwriting.<br /><br />I was recently talking to a fellow friend/guitarist about this CD and I told him, without any reservations, that it was probably one the finest pieces of music I've heard, in any genre, for well over twenty years. I told him I have to find some pot, because this album reminds of the first listening my friends and I had after pulling the plastic wrap off of Dark Side Of The Moon back in 1973. Yes, It's THAT good!<br />Steve put a few words in the liner notes inside the CD jacket that read something to the effect of (I don't have the cover with me at the moment) \\"Strap yourself in and take a ride from the shores of Lake Lomond to the rings of Saturn\\". And man, he couldn't have said it any better. The album is definitely a musical journey to n'th degree.

B004IFYMYI|5.0|The movie is one of the best movies, by one of the best directors of all time. Most people know that, But. The packaging of this dvd, is the best i think ive ever seen for a movie. The case is perfect, and as someone who likes to collect movies, that actually really matters to me. The special features are great as well, with 3 commentaries , a documentary, and more. Perfect, a must own.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Very well done movie interesting extras. Even for adults entertaining a lot going on in the background. For some little kids a little scary( two year old) although our two year old loves it. Good story.  Love it.
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|this album is boring and dull he puts no effort into his music plus hes one terrible role model since hes on a label that features bad role models like lil wayne nicki minaj etc etc etc this album was rushed and drake the fake returns with more fake efforts because he is indeed a fake this album has no emotion in it what so ever! whenever i wanna hear a album with emotion and passion i turn to other bands and musicians but drake the fake only cares about money and his posse of bad role models i e lil wayne birdman nicki minaj
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces is a memoir written by James Frey about his six week journey through intensive drug and alcohol rehab.  James tells this heart wrenching tale to give readers a glimpse into what recovering Addicts experience mentally and physically on a daily basis.  In the beginning, James finds himself waking up on a plane to who knows where, covered in blood, vomit, urine, and alcohol, he is missing his front teeth and has a large chunk missing from his cheek.  He has no memory of the night before.  After hitting rock bottom, James's friends help him onto a plane to Chicago where his parents meet him and immediately check him into the best Rehab center in the world.  From there, we see the day to day struggles James experiences dealing with detoxification, facial reconstructive surgery without anesthesia or pain killers, and the mental dependency to drugs and alcohol.  While in treatment, James meets the love of his life, Lilly.  As James regains control of his life, he helps Lilly do the same.   James's unorthodox writing style is a little distracting in the beginning but it quickly emulates the thought process of a person.  There are no quotation marks, commas are scarce, and lack of grammatical structure can be seen as lazy but this realistic style really allows readers to get into the mind of a recovering Addict.  This book would be perfect for several audiences because of the broad message that James is portraying.  Any one from high school to adults can enjoy this book.  This book can show the audience the dangers and horrifying truths behind drugs as well giving inspiration to those in a similar situation that recovery is possible.  James captures the hearts and minds of readers to give an intimate perspective on rehab.     While there is speculation over the legitimacy of this memoir, that should not be a defining factor of this book.  Memoirs are based off of memory and don't always portray the truth because they are based on one persons perspective.  There are several points in this book that seem too absurd to be real, but in the mind of James Frey, they ring true.  Like all literature, it should be read with a critical eye and not taken at face value.  This is one person's account of his experience in rehab, truth or not, it is a phenomenal story that really pulls the heart strings.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|When I had read they were going to release previous songs recorded from Amy Winehouse, I thought what other songs could there be that would top \\"Back to Black\\".  Well, they have found several on this CD and this is the reason why this is a great five star effort. I particularly like the jazzy \\"Valerie\\" and the stylish \\"Half Time\\" and her last recording with the remarkable Tony Bennett-\\"Body and Soul\\". Her spin on her idol Donny Hathaway's, \\"A Song for You\\" was sad; yet soulful to listen too because I feel she sang it from her heart.  However, the one song I really didn't like was \\"Like Smoke\\". The silly rap lyrics playing over her vocals ruined a completely good song, which didn't make a lot of sense.  All I can say when listening to this CD is that Amy Winehouse had lot more great songs to give to the world and it is very sad we will not hear her great voice again.
B000WN8AHA|4.0|A decent model for the intermediate modeller. Several very fine plastic parts that must be carefully cut from the sprue. Take very much care not to use too much glue or the moving parts will not. Pay special attention to the rear doors and the front wheels. Not a bad piece.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this version of Solitaire, it's. easy, fun and quick. I play it anytime I sit to watch TV or in bed until I fall asleep.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My kids loved the books so when I heard a short came out of it, I had to get it.  We checked it out from the library first and it was scarier (for my kids) than the book but just wonderful. Great animation and the kids still talk about checking it out again so I bought it.
B00005LOUP|1.0|I am a huge Seuss fan.  LOVE the Grinch.  Now that we don't have cable, I requested it from our library, and was surprised to get this Jim Carrey version.  We put on the fire, snuggled as a family and eagerly sat down to watch it.  About 30 minutes into the movie, I yawned.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't entertaining.  There were some cringe-worthy moments as this story introduced sexual innuendo between the Grinch and another character.  The scene where he winds up with his face in her breasts was downright icky.    The kids chuckled a bit at some of the sight gags, but when we stopped because of time (this is a LONG movie!), they didn't protest at all, and never cared to see the end.  Usually my kids love to watch any humorous movie and can't wait to see the second half.  But this Grinch bored them.  My husband and I talked afterward - this is not the Grinch we know and love.  Dr. Seuss must be rolling in his grave.  The added theme of consumerism and excess consumption weren't needed - nothing was needed.  The original story was brilliant in its own light.  I've since returned the dreaded movie and ordered the real Grinch on DVD to add to our collection.  I wouldn't waste your time with this version.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I snatched this Bluray version for $4.99 as my DVD copy has seen its wear and tear (yes, I have watched it that much).  This is one of my favorite movies. Yes, it could possibly be because of all the abs, but I do like movies that are based off of history/legends/myths so the story interests me.  The cinematics helped suck me in, obviously, and so did Gerard Butler at his finest (after Phantom of the Opera).  I like this movie even more than my husband, lol.  This will definitely be considered a classic decades from now in its own right.
0634060384|2.0|This book does not always distinguish between major and minor chords.  An F major chord and an F minor chord are both notated as simply \\"F\\" in Lullaby of Birdland, for example.  A major disappointment and oversight.  Some songs do distinguish, as can be seen in the \\"look inside\\" preview.  But many do not.
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay deserves a 2 1/2 out of five stars for myriad reasons.  First, the writing is sloppy and rushed throughout, especially in the last third of the book.  For example, several potential plot points are foreshadowed and then left unfinished.  Before Boggs dies, as an example, he tells Katniss to \\"kill Peeta and don't trust them\\", meaning Gale and her other companions.  The end of the story neither fits with this statement nor makes sense because her companions- including Peeta- turned out to be trustworthy.  Why did Boggs say this and how was it integral to the story?  This statement would have been more appropriate and the story would have been much more interesting if one or more of her companions- such as Gale- had been moles working for the Capitol.   Then there's Gale and her mother.  At the end Gale takes a 'fancy job' in District 2.  Really?  'Fancy' just doesn't fit his personality at all and nothing in the book would suggest he developed into a materialistic person.  Cold blooded, yes. Fancy, no.  The author clearly rushed to wrap up the love triangle.    And, what mother would abandon her sick, broken daughter and choose to never see her or her grandchildren again?  The mother supposedly had grown from her earlier ways of abandoning Katniss and to have her revert back to that behavior was out of place.  Finally, Katniss herself seemed to understand that violence has no place in an advanced, civilized society yet she willingly voted to continue the Hunger Games and she shot Coin, which were out of character for someone trying to stop the cycle of violence.  It didn't make sense because she seemed so sick of violence and fought so hard to stand up against it.  With more character development the author could have come up with a better way to illustrate her problems instead of just turning her into a 'crazy lady'.  In fact, with better character development the author could have created a much more intriguing story.  Not a good end to a magnificent series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|one of the best puzzle games I've played.  it is also the only Droid game I've paid to play.  worth the buck.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Awesome and addicting, finished all five in two months, could not put down and have not been able to find a comparable series to read next. Book 5 was the best.  Would highly recommend.

0060899220|5.0|Anthony Bourdain manages to paint an irreversible image in the reader's head about what truly goes on behind the closed kitchen doors of a restaurant.  Drugs, sex, even weapons dealing are all mentioned in this book about how Bourdain became one of the top chefs in New York City.     Without a doubt, Bourdain's love of the culinary world came from various experiences he had in his youth, which are for the most part what this memoir speaks about.  From washing dishes at a small tourist restaurant in Provincetown to being executive chef at one of the top restaurants in New York, Bourdain has seen it all, and it is not always pleasant.  While many chefs at high-end restaurants may look back upon their experiences as pleasant, Bourdain provides a very new and quite different outlook on cooking.  People do not become chefs out of love for food, people become chefs because they are good at it, and can get work done.     In Kitchen Confidential, Anthony Bourdain provides a new and interesting outlook on the world of cooking, something that I haven't heard of before.  No doubt Bourdain is one of the rare breeds of culinary artists he speaks to in his book; while his experience is sporadic and seemingly random, he has gained what seems to be immense knowledge about how to run a restaurant, something that has helped him become the master he is today.  For anyone looking to see what truly goes on in their favorite restaurant, this is for you.
B003YCIE68|3.0|Santa Claus The Movie(1985) is a fun piece of 1980's camp. It was produced by Alexander and Ilya Salkind(the Superman movies) and directed by Jeannot Szwarc(Jaws 2, Supergirl). The music score by the late Henry Mancini is quite good. I remember when TV stations frequently showed this film on Christmas in the 80's. Dudley Moore and John Lithgow are given top billing, but it's character actor David Huddleston who plays Santa Claus. Judy Cornwell plays Anya/Mrs. Claus. Mr. Claus and Ayna Claus almost freeze to death in a blizzard and they are saved by elves. In the 20th Century, Santa Claus has to deal with an unscrupulous, corrupt,  Grinch-like businessman(played by John Lithgow) who wants to ruin the spirit of Christmas.    The late Dudley Moore played head elf Patch. His name was Ollie in an early draft. John Lithgow is campy and over the top as corrupt toy maker B.Z. David Huddleston is warm, sincere and earnest as a flesh and blood Santa Claus. Carrie Kei Heim and Christian Fitzpatrick play kids who become Santa's friends. Burgess Meredith played The Ancient One. Santa Claus The Movie is impressive on a technical level and it was made on a $50 million budget. The filmmakers used over 20 flesh and blood reindeers as well as animatronic ones. The visual effects by Roy Field, David Lane, and Derek Meddings were state-of-the-art in 1985. It was made before movies used too much CGI. The script for Santa Claus does have some plot holes and there's McDonald's product placement in the middle of the film. Some people think of Santa Claus The Movie as \\"ponderous\\". At one point, the Salkinds tried to hire John Carpenter, Guy Hamilton, or Robert Wise to direct the film. The role of B.Z. was offered to Harrison Ford and Dustin Hoffmann. The Santa Claus The Movie novelization by Joan D. Vinge tries to give some backstory to the elves. The elves are also refered to as \\"Vendequm\\". Christmas is a religious holiday, yet Santa Claus The Movie was designed to not reference too muchreligion. Santa Claus The Movie is fun, lightweight, and wholesome. Check it out during Christmas.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|THE BEATLES-1: Little else can be written about those Liverpool lads' indelible impact on the musical &#34;blip&#34; that is rock n' roll. Taking cues, licks, and harmony tricks from CHUCK BERRY, BUDDY HOLLY, and THE EVERLY BROTHERS, they progressed from teen idols slinging two minute slices of unabashed pop nirvana to risk-taking, experimental craftsmen virtually creating the need for FM radio. All twenty-seven tracks here effortlessly topped the charts somewhere in the world, gathered for the first time on a single party platter. Check out the psychedelic underpinnings of JOHN's lyrical twister COME TOGETHER...the quiet charm of GEORGE's exquisitely rendered SOMETHING...the nursery rhyme charisma of YELLOW SUBMARINE administered as only RINGO could bring it...the stark mindset of ELEANOR RIGBY and YESTERDAY, technically &#34;solo&#34; efforts from PAUL. In lieu of obtaining their still vital catalogue of original albums, &#34;1&#34; serves as an economic and respectable Fab Four starter kit. What else one can utter upon encountering euphoric headshots like SHE LOVES YOU, PAPERBACK WRITER and GET BACK but, &#34;YEAH YEAH YEAH&#34;?<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BEATS
B006J38144|5.0|SOA has so many twist and turns \\"To Be - Act 1 & Act 2\\" gave the Sons an opportunity to run into a Season 6 or 7 easily.  When the season started I notice Tara's looks and remarked to myself that she is looking more like a Biker-Babe than a doctor. (It seemed she was embrassing the whole biker life style more than in previous seasons.)  I kept waiting for Tara to flash her tats or ride into the SOA parking lot on her own bike.  (Speaking of which it time for one of the gals on SOA to ride her own bike or introduce us to a female biker MC.)  Kurt has created opportunities to write the battle for head-old-lady between Gemma and Tara, and background story for a much younger Gemma, Jack's dad, John and Clay.  Also, he created an opportunity to introduce a baaad assss African American biker MC, someone is going to have to get revenge for the death of Le'roy's wife and our local sheriff has already introduced her dad as the badest crime boss in Oakland.  SOA remains one the best show on TV, I looking forward to several more season.

1400049628|5.0|I bought this book as (Joking) Christmas present for my boyfriend to go with his real one.  He hates zombies and when i saw the book i thought it would be a good choice for him.  This book got here quickly, and in great condition.  The actual content of the book was also good, and funny, even i had fun looking through it and reading it before i wraped it!  I would reccomend this book to someone who just wants to have fun, or a good present to your zombiephobe.

B005TZFZJC|5.0|I have loved Rihanna since she first came out years ago. I have every album and I can say she is quickly growing into her sexuality. This CD is NOT meant for kids. In fact, I don't listen to it with the kids in the car. This CD is loaded with funky songs perfect for working out. Yes, it is very sexual....but thats her. There are still a few love songs on the album, but she delivered exactly what I wanted...
B000NQRE0K|5.0|If you're wanting a good, clear, image then get this Blu-Ray.  I have original DVD with Mel's commentary and it's still the best commentary I've heard vs others for movies.  I'm into video editing and re-rendering for my different devices. I am please to say I can see the difference in the details of the images vs DVD.  Most movies aren't worth High Definition, but this one IS!!   I'm not a follower, and I won't be programmed by anyone..I check things for myself. DVD does very well still, so if you don't See the Detail..or care enough, yet, then stick with DVD.  I ~loved~ this movie when I saw it in the Theater, and now that I have a Large HD LG Monitor and TV, it's Sharp!!  I still use normal stereo and it sounds brilliant.   The packaging is pretty.  Hehe.  The 2nd disk has the extras.  They're a nice compliment to the movie...and the interviews were well done.  I have some insight into Mel from it about about he ~Feels~ the people for the movies he makes.  Very Cool!  His political/religious Beliefs mean nothing to me..his story telling, and the way he \\"Feels\\" how it should be told for a great movie, and passion for making them.   So, buy this movie. Buy AnyDVD and Donate to HandBrake or Donate to BD-Rebuilder as you encode for your iPad 2, iPhone and even iPod Touch's and your Desktop, Laptop and MacBook Pro computers.  The price is GOOD.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Haven't bought a new Christmas cd in years because it seems they all start to sound alike.  My son was talking about the new Michael Buble Christmas cd.  I trust his music judgement, so I purchased it.  Wow!!  I can't seem to get it out of my cd player!  I just keep replaying - over & over.  It's fresh, fun, and of course his dreamy voice is awesome.  If you buy only one Christmas cd, buy this one.  It's fantastic!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Looks the same as amazon's website across the pond. Price is roughly the same. Got it for 18 pounds shipped and sold by amazon. Check it out there, the cover looks exactly the same with the 18 mark on the front cover.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Was searching on Amazon for a toy for a 6 year old boy, when I happened to see the Perplexus Epic.  I had never seen this particular puzzle/toy before.  But WOW did it ever get my undivided attention then.  With a penchant for games and puzzles, I immediately checked out the details and reviews.  Within 5 minutes I had one ordered for myself.  When it arrived at the house I felt like the 6 year old who I was originally searching for a toy for.  The box was ripped and torn to pieces and the Perplexus carefully placed on my desk.  It looked beautiful with it's blue and white color scheme.  After admiring the magnificence of the design and look, I gingerly picked it up to begin to challenge myself.  WHAT A GREAT TIME!!!!  A true understatement to say that this is probably one of the most brilliant puzzles I have ever seen.  I can't wait for clients and co-workers to see this piece of engineering wonder and pick it up and try it.    Thank you,  Michael (A pleased 41 year old puzzle lover)
B003C5FMFI|5.0|It's a shame that this wasn't released as a 4cd boxset containing both concerts at the Hammersmith Odeon. These were the last 2 shows of Clapton's 1974 Tours of US, Europe, Japan.  Clapton had a wonderful band and they are razor sharp here.  The cd starts off with Clapton on accoustic guitar and George Terry playing beautifully melodious solos on Charlie Chaplain's Smile and Let it Grow.  Yvonne Elliman (JC Superstar and Saturday Night Fever fame) is by far my favorite vocalist to ever work with Clapton.  Then it's I Shot the Sheriff, Clapton's first song on electric guitar in London since the Rainbow concert where he had considerable help from Pete Townsend and Ron Wood.  He steps on the wah wah peddle and really delivers, playing an absolutely beautiful solo. The next night Sheriff would be more of a guitar duel with George Terry.  Little Wing has beautiful slow powerful guitar and backing vocals from Yvone Elliman and Marcy Levy.  The versions of Layla, Badge, Little Wing, I Shot the Sherriff are the best I've ever heard.  And Let it Rain rivals the version on Derek and the Dominos live, which imho is the only other cd that can match this for showing Clapton at his astounding best.
B002JODUI4|5.0|Well since I started to listen to electronica dance house and blah blah  I just want to say that this album is just incredible even years after I bought it, starting from Strobe, that I love that song simply love it, then Ghosts N Stuff thats hilarious it always puts me in the mood.  So i would totally recommend this album to any house lover that wants to experience something beyond any other things when listening to music.  hurray deadmau5.
B004Z29X3E|4.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene, brilliantly and subtly realized by Elizabeth Elizabeth Olsen, is a young woman pulled from world to world and obviously desperate inside to find a world she belongs in. The dysfunction in both worlds is alternately attractive and repellent, though eventually one becomes decidedly more repellent than the other - this may be a flaw in the movie, or it may be a statement by the filmmaker; I suspect the former is closer to the truth, but it's a relatively minor flaw which is overwhelmed by a slew of note-perfect performances.
B000002LFU|4.0|Too heavily amplified, frivolous, commercially-oriented, and a complete sell-out of the band's sound and indie credibility (in so many paraphrased words) were the primary complaints some long-time fans expressed upon the release of REM's sixth full-length release, \\"Green\\". And the criticism might be justified if you separate the phases of REM's recording career into universal points of absolute demarcation, but REM has always resisted being pigeonholed, incorporating distinctive instrumental flourishes that remind the listener of elements of the timeless, folk-tinged sound prevalent on REM's first (largely unamplified) three releases.   Although some longtime fans might've considered the chirpier, conventionally-arranged \\"Stand\\", \\"Orange Crush\\", and \\"Pop Song `89\\" to be material included because it had the potential to mine universal commercial appeal, it's my belief that these are actually pop songs with a subversive edge to them; this CD was recorded during the last year President Reagan held office, after a number of decisions that were dubious in legality at best drove the highly aggressive foreign policy he chose to pursue during the course of his last term. \\"Stand\\" in this context sounds like a call to become politically engaged; \\"Orange Crush\\" , ostensibly about the negative, carcinogenic impact of the Viet Nam era defoliant upon the veterans returning from that war, can be interpreted in the context of  preparing a new generation of young males for selective service  in response to a foreseen militarization of American society (which thankfully has not yet come to pass); \\" Pop Song `89\\" obliquely refers to the trivialities that keep the public from becoming aware of the environment or political climate. Savagely indicting President Reagan for his unsanctioned interference in the sovereign affairs of other countries, \\"World Leader Pretend\\" examines the hubris of leadership that refuses to acknowledge the checks and balances of legitimate government.   REM chose once again to work with Scott Litt, and he tightens the polish on the level of production (though it isn't as glossy as \\"Out Of Time\\"), bringing a punchy sense of aggressiveness to \\"Get Up\\" , \\"Orange Crush\\", \\"Turn You Inside Out\\", and \\"I Remember Califorinia\\". \\"You Are The Everything\\", \\"The Wrong Child\\", and \\"Hairshirt\\", however, are somewhat of a return to the band's acoustic roots, songs driven primarily through a heavily dominant mandolin line (marking this instrument's first appearance on an REM release) and sparse instrumental accompaniment, with \\"You Are The Everything\\" and \\"Hairshirt\\" given Micheal Stipe's plaintive, husky vocal treatment, and while there is a universally wistful feel to the music and Stipe's delivery, the lyrical content is largely affirmative.    My suggestion is that \\"Green\\" is worth getting on its own merits, not simply because it contains several tracks that were in heavy rotation on the modern rock charts and two (\\"Stand\\" and \\"Orange Crush\\") that still receive  airplay, nor because \\"You Are The Everything\\" is a perfect invocation and distillation of their timeless acoustic sound, but due to the sense of urgency and vitality that drive many of these tracks. Don't get it simply to cross it off of the kind of checklist maintained by a rabid completist; grab it because it shows that the band could evolve while still remaining true to its older musical roots, yet simultaneously recording songs with infectious hooks and more complex melodic arrangement.

B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This was an amazingly funny movie, one of the best rom-com's I've seen. Ever. Period. Steve Carrell was really great, not too over the top, but still managed to make his pain funny but fairly real. Julianne Moore was also good. I hate it when bad behavior is excused or swept under the rug, but her slightly morally ambiguous character could have been someone you'd love to hate, but it didn't go that way. Ryan Gosling. Smoking hot body. Passably talented. And who wouldn't want to take a lady's man and make him their own? Last but not least, Emma Stone. I love her. She is a fantastic actress, and is great here too. Her character did not take crap from anyone, very admirable. The ending was completely predictable in some ways, but there was a twist I did not see coming. And in a romantic comedy, unpredictability is something to cherish. So watch this, and cherish it, because it is wonderful.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|This cover for my Kindle really gives me that \\"book\\" feeling that I miss from turning pages.  I can carry it with me without feeling bound in by electronics.  It does need a place to store a stylus and it would be helpful to have a storage space for the headphones as well but all in all, I love it.
0375831002|4.0|The Book Thief is a marvelously written novel. It's narrated by Death, which is an interesting twist to the story. The youthfulness of The Book Thief also contributes to the wider innocence of it. It's set in Germany during World War II, adn focuses on a little girl named Liesel Meminger. She steals books to read after she is robbed of her brother, who dies at the very beginning. She finds a sort of peace in her books. Her mother also left, so she had to enter foster care. A bunch has been taken from her. Zusak is great at metaphors and the writing itself. His writing is mesmerizing. It's wondrous. You can practically feel th emotion dripping from these pages. The sarcasm was also a nice touch. It's very possible to be impressed and overwhelmed by moments in The Book Thief. This book is beautifully written. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read-- or even people who don't.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|I expected to at least be entertained by Ms. James, but her writing is dull and stilted. She makes almost no attempt to keep with the spirit of Jane Austen's characters and the whole thing seems pointless. Don't bother.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|It took me years to finally watch this but I now look forward to seeing it every Halloween. It's an easy, entertaining watch. What it lacks in sweeping imagery it more than makes up for in the fun plot. (And honestly, if you're looking for high level cinematography then you totally miss the point of this type of movie.)
038572179X|3.0|I bought this book ages ago and it sat on my shelf for a couple of years before I read it. Its one of those big suspense novels where you're waiting for the big secret to come out, and when it does your left thinking, so?
B005V1WZ10|3.0|I've been a huge fan of KoRn for many years now. I give all their albums a good listen before I judge. I've listened to this one three times now all the way through and it's about what I expected. I'll admit I was excited because I really dig \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" and thought maybe the album as a whole was going to be as good. I was wrong.<br /><br />While it's not terrible and certainly better than SYOTOS and Untitled it still has problems. Alot of the dubstep sounds are very similar in almost every song and the aggression and anger from JD is sadly missing. Songs like \\"My Wall\\", \\"Illuminati\\", \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Way Too Far\\" are repetitive and somewhat boring to listen to. It feels like they could have done so much better with them.<br /><br />There are good ones on here though. My favorites and ones that have a fresh feel to them are \\"Chaos Lives in Everything\\", \\"Kill Mercy Within\\", \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\", \\"Get Up\\", \\"Fuels the Comedy\\" and \\"Tension.\\" I love KoRn and always will, but I'm an honest fan and even though they are one of my favorites, I don't like everything they've put out. I love how they like to constantly experiment and progress as a band and I'll continue to support them no matter what direction they go. \m/
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Title pretty much says it. It's attractive, protective and lightweight. It fits great and actually helps me hold on to the Kindle Fire better. The Feel of the rubberized back is an improvement on the Kindles. I like the quality of materials - it's not just cheap plastic. It's textured and has softtouch velvet on the side that folds against the screen. HOWEVER - the fold back stand is crappy. Bad design. Just a couple of mm deeper, or a convex shaped slot would have taken care of it. I hope the Industrial design guys really use it as a stand. Within a few hours, I bet they would be re-designing it. The slot is definitely too shallow and not conducive to interaction. If you use it as a web device or Pandora radio (my fav app!) within a few touches, It WILL Collapse. Annoying. Contemplating return, but so far, nothing better seems to be available.  Update - Three weeks of use later: the inside \\"felt\\" part of the flap that covers the screen is a Hair Magnet. My cat's fur is all over it now and pain to remove.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|This adapter was working well at first, allowing me to use my flat screen as a secondary monitor to show videos and power points to my classes. However, one day it just stopped working altogether. There was no gradual breakdown of functionality. It was as if one day it worked and the next day it didn't.   Tested to make sure it wasn't the television by plugging in a PS3 using the same HDMI cable and it worked fine, making it clear that the problem was this adapter.  If there's one thing I need my electronics to be, it's reliable. This adapter is not.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I didn't really expect much when I rented this movie. The Wife and I were looking to see anything. I must say that this was a pretty good movie. It didn't get the rave reviews and promotion that Bridesmaids did but we laughed pretty hard at lots of points throughout the movie. I was a great way to spen a couple hours. I say rent it and see for your self.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Should be the best protection for the White iphone 4S that enhances the white color of the phone with its concentric spirals at the back. The transparent body ensures that you even forget that your phone is now protected. Volume buttons are accessible and doesn't obstruct the flash in the camera.  It passed all my requirements and was definitely cheaper than most bigger brands.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|My husband loves this show!  I love how I can pre-order from Amazon and know that I'll have the high quality item(s) that I've come to expect from them.
0142403873|5.0|This book was a lovely read for my school pupils and myself alike. we all enjoyed it very much indeed
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Maybe its too much to ask for XLR outputs, but I'm asking. Also, I use the CD/Tape input for backing drums out of my PC, using the Berhinger USB external sound card.  For some reason, I get a high pitched sound through the control monitor channel. It doesn't seem to show up on the recording, but I can't get rid of it, and I don't understand why its there. Otherwise its a solid unit.
030788743X|2.0|I am the perfect audience for this book as I grew up in the 80s and I played all the video games and watched all the TV shows that the author watched.  However, I require a book to have some substance and this has none.  How can I dislike a book that on the surface is such a good match?  Like the other low reviews have stated, the writing level is garbage.  That being said, if you do not read books very often you will probably really enjoy this book.  For active readers, not so much.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout. 20 minutes of serious workout and you're are done!! (plus 5 min warm up and cool downs) This is a really tough workout but I love it. All you need here is a set of hand weights. Everyone knows that circuit training is the best workout and she uses it. The great thing is that when you feel like the strength moves are gonna kill you, that circuit is over n you move on to aerobics and then when your heart is about to pound out of your chest, again it is time to move on to abs. Great super intense workout that hits all the problem areas and muscle groups and does so quickly. Again the advertising and lead in bla bla bla at the beginning is a bit annoying but I just fast forward through all that, or I hit play while I am still putting on my shoes so it's ready when I am :) There are modifications shown generally, but you know your own body so if there is an exercise you feel causes you a problem make up your own modification. Just as long as you don't let your heart rate drop you should be fine, repeat an earlier exercise even. I haven't had any problems, and all her exercises are fairly standard. Of course good shoes are a must! Again I love this really tough but totally worth it workout.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I like the simple but smartphone appropriate graphics.  The game play was smooth on my  Optimus V.  I got interrupted and wanted to save the game in progress.  I do not see a save feature so I must either start over each time our leave the program running in the background...
160059672X|5.0|Anything by Sherry Serafini has to be great! I've admired her work for many years & she takes bead embroidery to a new level. This is just as great as her other books. She never lets you down & always provides plenty of \\"eye candy\\" for inspiration! :)
B001UV4XI8|4.0|The reviews here convey the content of the movie well and I agree enough to give the movie 4 stars. But wanted to add this heads up: This \\"version\\" does NOT include the digital version like the images suggest. I should have been more careful and not trusted the pictures. My bad.
1600597963|5.0|This is a fantastic book & supplies a lot of inspiration for your own work, as well as tips & techniques.
B0024FAR5M|1.0|Sup sup y'all.... I love good tv shows and movies just like everyone else these days but last week someone really irritated me when they said 'Jersey Shore' was a dumb show and I should watch good tv shows like 'Sons of Anarchy'...So I hopped on my netflix account and lookd for this show...  Oh lord! This should'nt even be considered a TV Series! There is virtually no plot.. just a bunch of bikers hurting other people...Violence is NOT the answer people! The acting is also bad... Peggy from Married with chlidren needs to take lessons from Snooki Pillozi if she wants to have a succesful acting career. The other biker guys suck at acting and the action scenes are so boring I yawned most of the show!    Take my advice.... avoid this show and stick with good television series like \\"Jersey Shore\\" and any of those MTV teen mom shows.. if you want good TV viewing.. peace out folks!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root are amazing in this incredible story of love lost and found. Tradition and family keep the two lovers apart until Anne decides to put her foot down and make her own decision. I love character studies and in this book and shown in the movie, the surrounding personalities have a lot to be desired for kindness and generosity. Just love that movie.
B000002KIE|1.0|Sup peepz? How is every doin' this cold and cloudy winter day?  Anywho, lately ive been pretty angry at the haterz saying Avril Lavigne and Blink 182 are not TRU punk rock... and how I should listen to the Sex Pistols and Misfits and bla bla etc....  So I decided to give the Sex Pistols a chance... I know that Glenn Danzig is the Singer of the Sex Pistols and oh my his vocals are horrible on this album! The guitar and bass have no rhythm... (unlike Avril's guitarwork)  The lyrics he wrote don't even make any sense.... \\"anarchy in the UK\\" is a horrible song about people who don't like the government... thats bad!  Another thing is that there is no aggression or history behind this album... its just another generic 1990s wannabe punk rock album...   Not to mention, this album is missing a lot of songs like \\"Die, Die, My darling\\" , \\"I wanna be sedated\\" , and \\"London's Calling\\".  If they are gonna release another album I suggest that they include those...  Be sure to avoid poser punk like the Sex Pistols and stick with Limp Bizkit, Jonas Brothers, Avril Lavigne, and Milli Vanilli for good punk rock.  Peace out folkz!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth just made this movie sizzle. Most productions made him Darcy insipid and a weakling. In this Firth puts his own twist and changes things where we could almost dislike him. Just love this version of Pride and Prejudice. Jennifer Ehle is the best one to play this with Firth. She is lovely, firm and direct without being overbearing or childish. She is the best Elizabeth Bennet.
0670020478|5.0|For America to survive as a world power in the modern global society it is necessary to transform our public education system. NCLB and the nightmare to follow conforms to backward Industrial Age thinking that does not prepare our children to thrive in the Information Age that demands critical thinking and creativity.  The Element should be REQUIRED reading for policymakers that endeavor to micro-manage education via narrow minded legislation.  Cheers Sir Ken!
B002VECLVO|5.0|I could have used a few more stars for this wonderful movie. If the story does not get you, Colin Firth dazzled me with his handsome face and strong presence. His character was just stunning and the love of his life, just as beautiful. I fell in love.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|My gamer girlfriend swears that the headphones to get are \\"Turtle Beach\\", and after chatting with some friends on MW3 about multiplayer gaming, all of them swear that good headphones make a difference. So, when I saw these headphones at this lowered, company refurbished price, I picked them up, and my appreciation for sound design has since been elevated to another level. I have no idea how these compare to other headphones, but they're comfortable and I'm glad I bought them. I hope this helps.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|This product gets four stars??? Are you kidding me? The E7 is a great unit for the consumer group that it has been targeted for and even better than this. Apart from the nice look (honestly I don't even care about the looks) and the silicon protection cover, which is a great addition when you carry the unit around in your backpack, the sound it produces is great when used as a DAC (through laptop usb output). It reveals some very deep bass (when used as a DAC from a laptop), that I wasn't able to get through the 3.5 mm connector. I haven't tried it with an Ipod, but via the 3.5 mm output on the laptop the sound is not impressive and can't bring the deep bass that comes via the USB inlet.   Also, I am pairing it with great headphones - Grado 325. The E7 couldn't fill the gaps of Sony MDR-5000 headphones - those were lacking the lows too much and I had to return them, especially when comparing with the Grados. Actually I also tried the MTH M50 headphones, but they are not even worth mentioning, not sure how they got full 5 stars, honestly. I would give them 2-3 stars. 3 to 4 for the Sonys.  I also bought the E11 but wasn't impressed as I didn't need an amplifier, and the E11 is just that. Use the 3.5 mm connector on the E7 and you will have the E11.  If you want some great sound I recommend the E7 and Grado 325 combination. You want to pair the unit with good headset, otherwise I doubt you will appreciate it. Remember what I said about the Sony MDR-SA5000 DJ Stereo Headphones, they just weren't good enough, despite the amazing characteristics they have, and their price was quite steep. The grados are about 300.   By the way, the E7 has two 3.5 mm outputs (for two headsets) and I sometimes watch movies with my wife, each of us wearing his own headphones. I am very happy I bought it. Try it for yourself.
B000XXLY6I|4.0|Love the boots. Light, stlyish and durable. Waiting to see how they do in the wet and cold. I recommend not lacing all the way to the top or else it feels uncomfortable around the ankle. Leave one acelet empty. There's enough room in there for a heavy sock to help with keeping warm (even at my normal size). They are flexible but heavy duty enough to handle rough terrain. Plus you can't argue with the use of recycled products.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Despite some miscasting, this was a fun movie to watch.  Not too heavy, not too light.  The CGI was phenominal.  The story line was well thought out and logical.  It also fit well with the premise of the original Planet of the Apes, including the use of the same names for the various apes (though the orangutan appeared to be cloned from the remake of that film).  The science was...well the science never is too great in this type of movie.  But, then again, it doesn't really need to be.  Andy Serkis was brilliant, as was John Lithgow.  David Oyelowo had his character spot on and Tom Felton, while still showing signs of Draco Malfoy, played the character as if he'd grown a pair.<br /><br />That leads me to the miscast roles.  James Franco neither came across as the scientific type, nor did he show enough desire to maintain scientific discipline to be upset when it was breached (by others)...after he'd already breached it.  Freida Pinto  was cast to be cute, not to be relevant.<br /><br />The bit at the beginning of the closing credits was a work of genius.  It helped explain things to those lower down the evolutionary scale, who might not have understood things, otherwise.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|This is one show I watch every week with even more excitment every thing I turn it on..Watched all the 1st season at least twice..
1846467640|2.0|My 3yr old daughter is a big Peppa Pig Fan - The books are really really small...much smaller then they look in the photo (can fit in the palm of your hand), and the merchant also sent the books in a padded paper shipping envelope vs a small box so the books were fine but the cardboard case was crushed. (Not good packing)- Ad is missleading should say the size of the books instead of just the close up photo.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This is one show you will want to watch each week.. The first season quickly lead me into the second season and now awaiting to see if they will have a third season..
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Love, love, love Amy's take on these old songs. I listened to this repeatedly on a 4 hour drive and didn't tire of it. Amy has a terrific vibe going on with this album. Very inspiring.
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber maintained an interesting relationship with the VPO.  The impression I retain is of quite fine playing, tonal balance, secure rhythm and very defined phrasing.  After listening to Kleibers firm control of the finale other recordings will not please your ear.    The fifth symphony here, belongs in any collection, along with other Beethoven 5ths.  This performance is swift, taut and well controlled.  The analog recordings yield nothing to digital versions.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|Well, I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister so I have no idea how well it plays this series. All I know is that I got it super fast.
B005KA188S|4.0|The remake of the 1985 classic fright night was not only a beautiful high-def transfer, but every actor played their heart out for their rolls in the movie. I can easily say that this is my favorite roll by Colin Farrel because he played a really insane vampire. Anton Yelchin also did great in this movie as a freaked out teenager. Even the people who were killed did a great job... well, dying! This in my opinion is a must own on blu ray!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Wonderful movie, worth the watch!  Haven't seen a great film like this in years.  Makes you stand up and take notice of the past through a great story that depicts truth.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|As others have told the plot line to the movie already I won't re-tell it here. I will say that it was a wonderfully done movie - beautifully shot and executed- the characters were believable and lifelike, and the plot line was gripping. However, like many other movies, if you read the book [[ASIN:1250004349 Sarah's Key (Movie Tie-in)]] you might be a little disappointed- some things are inevitable skipped, shortened, and lost in translation from book to movie. However overall I enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it.
0307269752|5.0|Not only did I really enjoy this book, but I just finshed the Girl Who Played with Fire, and liked it just as much.  I can't say enough good things about this author's work. I will be jumping into The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest tonight, and I will be savoring every last word.  So sad that there will be no more.
032147404X|5.0|Highly recommend this book for those getting into digital SLR photography.  It's a great introduction to the lingo, hardware, and techniques.  Author's humor (and sarcasm) makes the book enjoyable and fast reading.  You basically \\"hit the ground running\\" with this book.  I'm looking forward to Book 2 of this series!
B005KDWUFA|3.0|I was disappointed in this latest CD.  The songs I knew were performed badly and so were all the others, seems their tempo was gone very slow, dragging.  I was so excited to hear they had made a new CD then to be so disappointed was a real let down.  I am not sure who chooses their songs but they need to shape up and get back to the wonderful music from before.  I have seen them live and have all their other CD's and won't get another one unless I hear it first..bhamilton
B0055SWM08|5.0|A nice challenge without becoming a head throb. No Gore or mayhem. Just simple fun. I even found myself loosing track of time. Pretty good for a little drop of water. Thanks creative app people!
0316287059|4.0|This book proves once again that Kevin Aucoin was amazing! However, it didn't really help me figure out any new tricks or looks (and I'm not a makeup artist or anything like that). In my opinion it has some content as \\"Making Faces\\" and a great selection of examples. I do not think it is a bad book or anything like that; the transformations are astonishing. However, I would have just stayed with my copy of \\"Making Faces\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app offers all the different settings you'd want in a solitaire game. If you like solitaire, look no further, this is the app for you.
0060254920|3.0|I like it alright.  More so only for the illustrations.  The story is pretty \\"meh\\". But my 3 1/2 year old HATES this book.  We've read it a couple times and she won't let me read it to her anymore.
1451627289|4.0|Stephen King;s long period of personal darkness seems to have ended, and with a bang.  11/22/63 shows King at the top of his form.  He leaves the macabre behind and spins a hell of a yarn.  The only lightweight part was a skimpy explanation about the in's and out's of time travel.  It was confusing and far too short.  Other than that, I found it easy to suspend my disbelief and go with the story.  Marguerite Oswald was so sharply drawn I actually felt sorry for her sons.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased the  Graphite Micro Folio Cover for my Kindle Fire, sight unseen. I really like this product. It has protected my Kindle and is easy to open and close. Also my husband recently watched a live stream from ESPN and could set it up on our table and watch it. Great product and asset to my Kindle Fire!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app runs better than weather bug on my android &amp; kindle fire. Only bad thing us that it took me so long to find it!
B0058VW36U|1.0|App is awesome. Made the mistake of buying from Amazon. Never again. First and last purchase. Update has been around for too long on the Android market. What's your excuse amazon?
B000OHZL1W|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies and it was a birthday gift for my   son. He also loved it. It was delivered in a timely fashion.   Peggy Garrett
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun and simple. This was the first app. I download on my new kindle fire. I highly recommend it.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and doubt I have anything to add that other positive reviews haven't already touched on.  However, as someone who always reads credits straight through to the end I was pleased to see that the images of the runaway dogs seen on the bulletin board where Joe posts a picture of his own dog Lucy came from animal shelters.  Thanks to exposure from being in the film, if only for a moment, the dogs have all been adopted.  I can see the description now:  \\"Lovable lab looking for forever home.  Was seen in the blockbuster Abrams/Spielberg film 'Super 8'!\\"  This movie gave new lives to some homeless animals and that is a wonderful thing.
B005NPBTQ6|3.0|Does anyone miss \\"Love is Hell\\" 1 and 2? I sure do. He is a bit too Neil Young in this album. I appreciate his massive talent, but after the third song, I am done.
B004EPZ070|1.0|I ordered the DVD and it arrives right on time, but then when I watched I found that it was scathed. So I contacted the seller and they were great about sending a DVD out right away. But then when I went to watch the new one I found this one to be scratched as well, I didn't bother contacting the seller again and just left it alone. So the seller is great but the product not so much.
0670022411|2.0|I bought this book after hearing the author on NPR. I should have known that an academic (and I am one) would be anything but concise. The book is far too long, and the story line is too predictable. It's very much like just about every other male-vampire-falls-in-love-with-magical-woman story out there (think True Blood without the biting). The artistry fails when the female protagonist discovers that she's the most powerful witch who's ever lived and can do just about anything with magic. And given that her vampire lover is one of the most powerful vampires who has ever lived, there's not much of a question about which way the story goes.   What was truly disappointing was reading all the way through hundreds of pages only to find that there is no ending to this story in this volume - it's the first volume of a multi-set story. I felt pretty cheated. While the story isn't horrible, I won't be spending my money on the second part (it just wasn't that intriguing); nor will I be spending the time that I could use more wisely on better-written fiction.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great note taking app, hard to believe the cloud storage is really free. Used it to plan a wedding, and now use it for lists.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this album given the single \\"Headlines\\" that was released prior to the album, that was a two months ago. Now here it is, after umpteenth listens of the entire album.   This album is certainly an improvement over the last album by many miles. The biggest part of the improvement is the production. Last album was decent but it seemed pretty premature, and it was more for the radio and music videos.   The Good: Like I said the production and the lyrics are certainly an improvement, Drake has become more of a story teller and some of these songs give me insight into who Drake is and what he thinks. It's a nice change of artistry when you considered the game as a whole. He's certainly has embraced his rhythmatic, smooth side vocally. There are very few rappers that can pull of singing or a smooth R&B side and it work like this kid here.  Which is also a plus. The album is moody, emotive, personal, daring while it also is gritty. Another good thing is the versatility of his collaborations starting with the female singer from Canada singing the hook on \\"over my Dead Body\\". Wow!. A big plus for me is that he got Andre 3000 on the album. I smell an Andre 3000 solo album coming out. Andre 3000 blew up another collabo.   There are more great songs on this album than the last, in my opinion. I can easily listen to the album all the way through without skipping, sometimes i go back to a song more than once.   The Bad: There really isn't too many bad things with the album. The album came off a little too \\"R&B\\" heavy. There were only maybe 3-4 straight rap songs; \\"Lord Knows\\" \\"HYFR\\" & \\"The Real Her\\" (my favorite song). He did minimize the \\"radio\\" songs. He attached interludes to the end of songs instead of making them separate tracks. Sometimes I didn't want to hear the interlude all the time, but they weren't that bad. While he expanded his lyrics, he was never the overtly braggadocius type, he hasn't really pushed it too far to eye opening territory. But to his credit, he has gotten deeper with his lyrics. Lil' Wayne should've came up with new lyrics for his portion of \\"The Real Her\\", those are the same lyrics from \\"Tha Carter IV\\". C'mon son!  I was excited to see that Stevie Wonder was featured on the album, but he was minized to just a harmonica part. Maybe there'll be a remix coming out where he actually sings or raps on it.   Like i said there aren't too many bads and this album is leaps and bounds better than the last album. Slowest wins the race.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Brilliant movie set in 1950s NZ; when an unlikely school friendship develops between the attractive, wealthy Juliet and scowling working class Pauline, it soon turns into an obsession. Living in their own imaginary world and brought together through shared problems with their parents and their health, their passion is seen as unhealthy and their parents decide to separate them... Horrific but utterly compelling
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Lioness may have been assembled in a rush, but I actually think it is a very good representation of her talent and an excellent CD.  I have not always been a fan.....not because I didn't believe in her talent as a artist, but more due to the inconsistency of the performance.  Amy Winehouse was at times amazing and had the ability to take an older song and give it a new twist with her voice, her rhythm and her style. I loved her interpretations of \\"A Song For You\\" and \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" These covers as well as the originals of the songs she wrote are beautiful.  You sometimes listen and wonder what decade she was born and performed..... are we back in Paris, NY with the beginnings of Jazz or here in 2011?  It is a really beautiful CD.  May she rest in peace.
B004A14W3G|5.0|I recently bought a copy of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" and sent it to my adult daughter as a gift. The new copy of the book was delivered in a very timely manner and was in new condition. The book was enjoyed by my daughter. I recommend this seller highly
1423140591|5.0|Oh how I LOVE Percy Jackson! Rick Riordan is absolutely masterful with this series. This book is the second one in an interesting spin on the Percy Jackson series. Apparently there is a Roman camp of demigods as well and Percy Jackson ends up there with amnesia courtesy of Hera. Of course it has the usual adventure and quests and all kinds of action. I really wanted to see everything from Percy Jackson's point of view again but it wasn't too bad having the perspective of his two new friends. I thought it was interesting the way that the Roman camp was run, it seemed a bit more successful and useful than the Greek camp. I love mythology and I love Rick Riordan's new spin on what he originally started out as Greek mythology. This is an extremely well written book and I recommend it to all Percy Jackson fans but you definitely need to read the first one before this one.<br /><br />Also posted at [...]
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice to have this ap on my kindle fire!  I don't have to put my book down when I am in the middle of my book!
0553386794|5.0|First I have to say this book was 800+ pages (which I loved), extremely frustrating and even more riveting. When I found out it was being made into a television series I decided I had to read all the books so I could judge if the show is as good as the book. I could not put this book down. The brutality and intricacy of all the plots and fights that went on in this book was intriguing to say the least. The only thing that I can say bothered me about the book was that the point of view kept switching from character to character. I normally find most books to be predictable but this book kept me guessing and on my toes until the end. It definitely made me want to pick up the next book right away and continue to see where the characters were headed. I recommend this book to any fans of fantasy novels or those who want a deeper understanding of the television series.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Overall I have been pleased with this product.  It fits my Kindle Fire like a glove.  Very durable.  The screen does fold as the picture shows, but it does not really support as well as I was hoping it would.  It can slip out of the little groove/slot that is designed for it to hold.  Some apps require the screen to be the other direction as well, so \\"the fold\\" won't work.  Very durable and nice looking, just a little tweak on the design and it would be perfect.
B004WJRDN2|5.0|Yes, I know this album is 41 years old, but it sounds as fresh today as it did back then.  The difference is, the sound quality has been improved for this archive set.  You can hear things on it now that you couldn't hear on the vinyl.  But what makes this new release stand above all others is 1) the book giving the background of the production with loads of photographs by Linda McCartney, 2) the second CD with alternate song versions and newly released tracks that were recorded in 1970, 3) the DVD of performances and 4) the option to download the album engineered two different ways.  If you're a Macca fan, I recommend this set highly!  It will go well with the archive versions of Band On The Run & McCartney II.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan of re-makes.  If people of a younger generation can't appreciate the brilliance of Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, or even Kevin Bacon in Footloose, then maybe they shouldn't bother. I don't want to compare Fright Night to Rear Window or anything, but this was one of my favorite scary movies growing up. I still love it as an adult, especially now that I can appreciate how sexy Chris Sarandon was. So, needless to say, I was a little wary of this re-make. Then I saw that Marty Noxon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was behind it. Buffy is my all-time favorite television show, so I knew this re-make was definitely worth a gander.  The cast the new Fright Night was another draw. Anton Yelchin is always likable.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse is always funny. Toni Collette is great as Charlie Brewster's mother, and it was a pleasant surprise to have a more aware and present mother in the storyline. Let's also face facts, Colin Farrell is sexy. Add in Vampire Colin Farrell to Marti Noxon's writing and my tickets were purchased five minutes ago.  To put a cherry on the top of that, David Tennant is Peter Vincent. Doctor Freaking Who is in this movie.   In all, this re-make was the best pleasant surprise.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Just an advice for writers and directors of TV series.  I hope you buy all the boxes of Breaking Bad (from season 1 to 4) and learn how to write and direct a show.  This is great...  ... everything else not!!!
0345529057|5.0|The product came in just a few days and it was carefully wrapped up. The box set was brand new and the price was a amazing! With shipping, it was still way cheaper than store prices. I definitely recommend the Game of Thrones Trilogy to everyone. Great reads, couldn't put them down!
B005V4FJC4|4.0|This She & Him album is a lot of fun.  Zooey Deschanel has a sweet and natural voice that delivers genuine quality and charm to her tracks.  With that going for her, not to mention her fame as the lead lady and crooner in the movie \\"Elf\\", it was inevitable that She & Him would produce a Christmas album.  They delivered.  Overall this album carries the standard Christmas fare in a new and enjoyable way, true to the She & Him sound.  It has a definite low-key, but fun mood to it.  So when you want to listen to some nice Christmas music, but not get overly excited about it, this album offers a good accompaniment to the mood.  Recommended!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Thisis my all-time favorite.  The language ia a little rough but accurate for the time and place.  The story is the most heart-warming and inspiring I have ever seen.
0143117009|5.0|For a book that's a call to arms and an educational tool, the author's points kind of sneak up on you.  Jared Diamond lays it all out early in the book -- that many human civilizations have destroyed their environments, and thus, themselves -- but he does so in such an engaging way that it takes a while for the alarm bells to really ring.  But eventually, they really do, just like Al Gore rang them a decade ago with his lectures and film about global warming.   Prof. Diamond says that he used an undergraduate lecture class as the testing ground for this book, and it shows.  He painstakingly lays out his points (\\"There are six types of ecological damage, and I will now discuss them...\\"), but somehow it's entertaining to read.  He works through the same themes over and over again, especially about how deforestation causes a cascade of problems from food production to water quality and quantity to loss of habitat for animals and plant species.  In place after place over tens of thousands of years, he finds evidence of how man used natural resources recklessly and then perished as a result: Easter Island, Chaco Canyon, the Maya, the Vikings.  Occasionally, Diamond points out a bright spot, such as the Inuit surviving on Greenland for 700 years (until a 2nd wave of intrusion by Europeans ended their isolation forever) or the relative success in the Dominican Republic today.  Those cultures show the virtues of living within the boundaries of what nature has provided in a particular place and adapting lifestyle and technology to what is available.  Diamond suggests that steps are being taken across the world to mirror those smarter ways of living, even as we rapidly move down a generally destructive path.  The most moving parts of the book for me were the descriptions of lost civilizations, perhaps because I find them to be so romantic.  What happened at Easter Island or to Vikings who sailed to Newfoundland and roughed-out a life for hundreds of years on Greenland is irresistable fodder for me.  Diamond does a great job of explaining how they lived in a most practical sense: what did they eat, hunt, and wear? Did they have human enemies? Did they have contact with other humans?  With his descriptions, it's easy to put yourself in their place, even though you wouldn't really want to live in such unforgiving conditions.    The other parts of the book, in which he explores more familiar cultures (current-day Montana and Australia, for example), are just as well done. They just aren't as romantic.  The great thing about this book is that it's both a meditation on how we can save the planet and also a cultural-biological history of how man has chosen to challenge nature for the last 10,000 years.  It works on both levels.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this thing really has the potential to increase productivity and convenience like no other app I've used. works great on Kindle Fire.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I must be in the minority-- I couldn't get to this album, or the artist either. Adele does a lot of screaching throughout the CD that gets really old after a while. Using it for affect is one thing; but as a constant part of your interpretation of the music, that is something entirely different. I picked up the CD after a friend of mine gushed about this CD; proclaiming it to be one of her all-time favorites bar none. And admittedly, Rolling in the Deep was a catchy song. I couldn't help but compare Adele to Joss Stone-- another British \\"Soul\\" singer-- which reminded me of the movie about the british \\"soul\\" band The Commitments. So to me, there is nothing fresh or unique about Adele's contribution to the British Soul-Singer genre. As one other reviewer commented, all the songs started to sound the same, with the same vocal inflections, etc.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:   Buy  SUMMARY:  This DVD set is a welcome improvement to a classic series. Overall the series is well done with only a few minor flaws. The primary issues lie in the DVDs and packaging.  DETAILS:  The episodes have been cleaned up, sharpened, etc. Even the music was rerecorded. Overall well done. There are occasional minor issues such as the CG being inconsistent, or where they missed cleaning up some scenes. On the other hand some of the effects are stunning. The additional content is also pretty good as some of it explains the remastering and some is interviews with actors, and other key people.   The disappointing parts are in the DVDs and packaging. The DVDs are plain sliver disks with very fine print near the center giving the disc number etc. You would think they could have done a silkscreen on them but I guess they are cutting costs. Additionally it makes one wonder who handled the disks. Mine came with minor scratches etc that I've never seen on production DVDs before. The case is ok but be careful with the insert/box the dvds come in, its a bit flimsy.
B001HN694K|5.0|This dvd is a very bizarre but very good movie to watch certainly a bit dark for children of a younger age groupl For them I would hope parents use the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland. This one is definitely a dark one. Yes this one is Disney too but not the animated one. I would strongly suggest that very young viewers watch the animated version of Alice in Wonderland then grow into this one.
B0031QVW2U|5.0|PERFECT FOR HOLD  THE CAMERA STRAP, IT IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS IS VERY GOOD. THANK YOU FOR THE FAST DELIVERY.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|My husband enjoyed this album alot. He as well as I have been and probably will always be Scorpion fan. Some people who are younge than us know only the Scorpion version of the song \\"Dust in the wind\\". The original was recorded by the group called Kansas. Back to this album it sounds great a joy to listen to and recall the words and enjoy it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very useful, detaled, I like design and colors, reports are just fine, works great on my Kindle, thank you The Weather Channel!
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie of all times. It is star packed from James Caan, to Maggie Smith. A who dunnit and a set of slueths try and figure out who killed the host. Very tongue in cheek humor. I first saw this movie when it came out back in the late 1970's early 1980's with my aunt. I loved watching then on the big screen and I love watching it now on the television screen through my dvd player. It is truly a MUST watch.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I had gigantic hopes for this movie, it failed them. I think the only aspect that made this movie worth while was Zach Galifianakis.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book finishing it in one day. The second book was good to but not as good as the first and I have to say I was disapointed with the last book even though I read to the end. Would like to read more from this author.
B001G9LV9S|4.0|There's some difference of opinion about this deluxe edition, but it sounds awesome to me. If this is the 2000 remaster, it's a good one. I agree that disc 2 isn't as good as the extras in the Teaser and the Firecat deluxe edition, but they're enjoyable anyway. The packaging and booket are beautiful and very nicely done. Nice job.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover fits the Kindle Fire snugly and provides great protection. Additionally, if I don't feel like holding my Fire, I can turn the front cover over and use it as a stand for the Fire! This is quite a superb item. Now, if it only came with a built-in light . . .

B002NFCHBA|4.0|This complete disk set contains many piano players. Players are different and all are not Chopin players by mind. I think the best are Krystian Zimmerman, who plays only a few performances unfortunately, Anatol Ugorski in some compositions, as well also young Vladimir Askenazy, and especially Maria Joao Pires who is a real Chopin player. Maybe also Rafael Blechacz in some compositions. Maurizio Pollini is not by my mind a Chopin player. He plays too loud and uses too much pedal, mechanistic player by my mind. I do not like his playing of Chopin. That is the worst part in this collection or CD's I think.<br /><br />Erkki Terho<br />Finland

0807014273|4.0|Everyone should read Man's Search for Meaning at some point in his or her life. I personally am not a huge fan of pulling a book from the shelf and reading for hours, but I could not put this book down.   In his book Viktor Frankl uses his experiences in concentration camps to teach this valuable lesson: that when one finds meaning to life, then trials, challenges, and pain become more possible to overcome. Frankl, who is a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, uses his background in psychology to help him survive.  I really liked the book because he taught the valuable lesson that no matter where you are and what happens to you, no one can control your thoughts, mind, and attitude. Frankl is thrown into Nazi prisons and endures more than I will probably face in my lifetime. But he showed me that even if your job, home, family, career, and name are taken away, no one can take away what is inside of you.   The possibility of seeing his family again was Frankl's motivation to survive the different situations that he was thrown into. I really enjoyed the moral of the book and his desire to survive. I wish that he would have written more about his experiences and time in the camps. The book is a short read, and about the last third is devoted to explaining his psychotherapy called Logo Therapy.   One of the reasons that I enjoyed reading the book so much is because it is a part of the world's history from an individual's perspective. I personally felt like I could relate different parts of my life to the things that were being said in the book. I was never put into a concentration camp, but I think that at some point in everyone's lives, they are stripped of something.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a lot out of a little. If I can read it, you can too!
B0067QPVD2|5.0|I feel like the director went through great pains to tie this movie to the original. There is a hole in the plot, but it's not that big and doesn't take away from it.  I mean even if other die-hard  Thing fans (like me) take issue with this film, on its own it is definitely the best alien horror film to come out in a long time.  And I LOVE Mary Winstead...

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I waited 10 years to see them together back-to-back. I am so blown away. This is the way to watch these movies. Great collection. Epic story. Dobby is the greatest character of them all and Snape is worth 8 movies. ENJOY!
B005Q4CKI0|5.0|Before Anne Perry became famous as a novelist she was famous as Juliet Humle who helped murder her best friend's mother. Director Peter Jackson chose to tell a fictionalized version of what occurred in 1954 for his first serious and mainstream films \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" a film that displays his remarkable ability to tell suspenseful stories while also handling the fantasy elements exceptionally well.<br /><br />Featuring Kate Winslet in one of her earliest roles as Juliet Hulme and Melanie Lynskey as Pauline Rieper, the film nicely captures the flavor of the 50's and the often represssive atmosphere that existed at the time. Both actresses do exceptional jobs in their roles and the supporting cast give marvelous supporting performances.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite nice but keep in mind that the film was shot intentionally \\"soft\\" particularly during the fantasy sequences of the film. Detail is stronger here than the older DVD and there are nice textures throughout while color looks terrific and isn't oversaturated.<br /><br />The audio likewise has some limitations but the 2.0 DTS lossless sound is extremely good--there's loads of detail and dialogue comes across with good clarity.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Lion's Gate has chosen NOT to include any special features. As I recall there was a short documentary produced for this film and that certainly should have been included. It's also disappointing that Lion's Gate either didn't ask for(or Jackson chose not to provide) a commentary track. Given how pivotal this film was in establishing Jackson's reptuation as a \\"serious\\" film director I'm surprised there's nothing here that also discusses his choice to make this project.<br /><br />Although the lack of special features is disappointing, \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" IS an improvement over the previous DVD editions and fans will want to pick this terrific, disturbing movie up.<br /><br />Recommended.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I bought the Kindle version for my new Kindle Fire and for the most part I'm very pleased with it.  As a Catholic I was apprehensive to purchase the ESV Study Bible as it is a version of the RSA primarily for believers of the Protestant faiths.  It's not a Catholic version so it does not contain the books that are considered part of the Apocrypha. I did compare some of the texts to a version of the RSA 2nd edition for Catholic and found it to be very close to the ESV texts.  What I really like is the 20,000 notes that you can reference on the passages and all of the extra items such as the maps, and articles that explain why the books of the bible were selected and why the books of the Apocrypha were not.  As a Catholic we are taught that some souls may go to Purgatory before they enter heaven. The ESV Study Bible explains that the supporting passages in the old testament are contained in the books of the Apocrypha which many Protestants do not consider canonical. So that is the reason they do not appear in this version of the ESV and also the same reason that Protestants do not believe in Purgatory.  I like the informative introductions to the books of the ESV and the amount of details they provide. I do wish that Crossway would publish a Catholic authorized version which would include the books of the Apocrypha. The ESV is so large that it's a lot to deal with on a 7 inch Kindle Fire, but for the most part it fits the device well.  I like using it on my laptop too as it provides more screen real-estate to view the maps and tables that are part of this study bible. It is a large file and takes awhile to download, but once loaded it opens as quickly as any other book and you would never know its a huge file compared to a 400 page book, the ESV is thousands of pages.  So for $10, I can live with out the Apocrypha in this edition.  It's the best deal I have found on the Kindle for a study bible of one of the most popular versions of the Bible. I may even consider a purchase of the hard cover version at the price Amazon is selling it for.  Check it out.  [[ASIN:B001CDWFPC ESV Study Bible]]
B000066C1N|5.0|My sister and I love this album.. we have listened to \\"Here I am\\" so many times that we just sing it around the house (we can harmonize really good too).  I love Bryan Adams voice, because it makes me think of a horse.  (That's a compliment because I'm a major horse-lover)=D

B00406Q428|5.0|Once again Merlin takes our notions of what the sword of Excalibur is meant for and turns it into something more powerful than just a weapon for Arthur.  As with all things with the show, Merlin himself, along with the powerful magic of the Great Dragon, once again is instrumental in creating Excalibur, one of the best known symbols of Arthurian legend. Although its creation stems from the past mistakes of King Uther Pendragon. The use of a wraith, summoned by the sorceress Nimue to avenge the death of Uther's wife Igraine, as the reason for creating Excalibur is a very novel approach for creating a weapon that is made specifically for Arthur to destroy that which is already dead.  This episode more than the others shows Uther as more than just a cold-hearted king with a pathological fear of magic, but a warrior king and a self-sacrificing father. Uther is a complex man here.  This is another episode that provides the origin of one more symbol for those familiar with some of the Arthurian legends -- but in its own \\"Merlin-esque\\" way.
0061689246|5.0|I ordered this book as a Christmas present for my boyfriend seeing how much he loved the movie.

I'll definitely be ordering more products from them. :)
B00406RMOM|4.0|Merlin once again gives an interesting spin to pre-Arthurian Legend with Lancelot and Guinevere.   Although we know Gwen (Guinevere) as a servant, a departure from the legends, we now have Lancelot being introduced as not just a commoner, but one whose heart belongs to Guinevere as only one can when \\"love at first sight\\" happens. Merlin is the catalyst. Lancelot saves Merlin's life, and as thanks he wants to make Lancelot's dream to be a knight of Camelot a reality. But Merlin also sets in motion the start of Guinevere's and Lancelot's romance when he enlists Gwen's help in outfitting Lancelot to pretend he is of noble birth to gain that knighthood.   This is one of those episodes that is so sweet with the tentative looks and actions of the two sweethearts, and the nobility and humility of Lancelot. Angel Coulby and Santiago Cabrera seem perfectly matched as the two lovers. The musical themes used to highlight the romance between them and the bravery of Lancelot seem to underscore those moments quite brilliantly.  A very enjoyable take on the Legend of Guinevere and Lancelot.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|.<br /><br />A serious story of the French persecution of their Jewish citizens during WWII, Sarah's Key is an impelling tale of a young girl's struggle with her captivity and the consequences of her actions.  Set in Paris in 1942 and 2009, The film switches back and forth between the 1940s and 2000s as the plot develops.<br /><br />The story is told by an American journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) who in 2009 discovers that her French husband's family bought a dwelling that had been occupied by a Jewish family before the internment.  Julia becomes fascinated with the history and resolves to discover the truth concerning the events of 1942.<br /><br />The Jewish family  Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski and their children are rounded up by the French police in 1942.  The family lost all their possessions, them they were separated and sent to different work camps before being transported to Auschwitz.<br /><br />Unlike many films about the Holocaust, Sarah's Key does not focus upon the death camps or the killing of thousands of Jews.  Instead, this story is about Sarah who locks her little brother in a closet to protect him when the French police come to arrest her father.  Unfortunately the police take her and her mother as well and sarah is unable to return home to release her brother from the closet.  Sarah becomes focused upon escaping the police so she can rescue her brother.<br /><br />The film does show some of the initial suffering of those Jews who are arrested by the French.  There are several graphic scenes of police brutality and indifference of the general population to the plight of those captured.<br /><br /> Julia Jarmond  Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent as Julia Jarmond, and Niels Arestrup is outstanding as the French farmer who aids Sarah.  However ten year old Melisine Mayance carries the movie as the young Sarah Starzynski.  Mayance is talented and according to her director (DVD special effects) a gifted natural actress.<br /><br />Sarah's Key is a gripping movie.  The story is based upon a best selling novel.<br />I recommend this film.ased upon a best selling novel.    I recommend this film.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is a \\"real\\" review. I didn't know the company from Adam and am only writing this because I have been so *darn* frustrated to find a good SD/USB MP3 player that I can play through my car radio. Most of them are very, very poor.  It is awesome because the form factor is perfect. Fits right in a cigarette lighter and then folds down so you can easily see and manipulate the controls. Screen is bright and big and shows a lot of info. Works well with USB and SD (I've tried with both).  Most of all, the sound is *crystal* clear into my stereo and it allows for selection of almost any unused spectrum on your radio unlike some lame devices that have a switch for just a few, fixed stations.  This is simply the BEST SD/USB/Aux capable in-car transmitter I have ever used. It is just awesome. It freaking rocks. Best thing I've bought for the money in a long, long time.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This controller is  both easy to install and feels a lot like a Xbox 360 controller. It's like playing Xbox 360 all the time and deciding to buy a PS3. With this controller it  feels  like there's almost no difference between this one and a Xbox controller. For the price its a good deal. It can be a little annoying to figure out how to set it up but just read the tiny guide if there is any trouble.  This is a easy controller to set up once you have to cord figured out. All around pretty easy controller to use.
B005JZBP8W|1.0|A wonderful classic movie musical has been given an appalling transfer to high definition.  It moves, shakes and wobbles throughout the entire running time. Image quality is highly variable.  There are severe color issues on the left and right sides of the image, especially notable in darker scenes.  This is one of the worst transfers of a 70MM production that I have seen.  The only positive is that the audio is a marked improvement on the standard DVD.  Avoid and let's hope a fix is forthcoming - but don't hold your breath waiting!

B005GSVFF0|3.0|POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)<br /><br />My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />There are about 31 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer but many of them are quick. An additional 11 effects made it to 25%.<br /><br />The 3D is somewhat inconsistent from scene to scene. A few scenes looked great but most lacked in-screen depth, being shallower than in most animated 3Ds. Many times the background was flat and the cardboard cutout syndrome is obvious regularly. This is one of the earlier conversion attempts (2005) and it shows.<br /><br />The film itself had some LOL moments and IMO the 3D even though flawed does add to the viewing experience.<br /><br />Active Glasses Users: Near the end of the film crosstalk was evident 4 times.

Eric Clapton playes on the most sensitive strings of soul and You can feel his presence. Great music, what a great show.
0380730405|5.0|Pages:  410<br />Release Date:  This edition - 2008; first edition - 1938<br />Date Read:  2011, October 14th - November 12th<br />Received: Own<br />Rating:  5/5 stars<br />Recommended to:  15+<br /><br />Summary -<br />\\"Last Night I Dreamt I Went To Manderley Again.\\"<br /><br />So the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter remembered the chilling events that led her down the turning drive past their beaches, white and naked, to the isolated gray stone manse on the windswept Cornish coast. With a husband she barely knew, the young bride arrived at this immense estate, only to be inexorably drawn into the life of the first Mrs. de Winter, the beautiful Rebecca, dead but never forgotten...her suite of rooms never touched, her clothes ready to be worn, her servant -- the sinister Mrs. Danvers -- still loyal. And as an eerie presentiment of evil tightened around her heart, the second Mrs. de Winter began her search for the real fate of Rebecca...for the secrets of Manderley.  (From Goodreads)<br /><br />My thoughts -<br />Golly goodness I really really really love this book.  It is one of the most unique, thought-out, and weirdly fascinating books I have ever read and probably will ever read.  It was recommended to me by so many people and I found it for less than $2, almost brand new, at a 2nd hand store, and couldn't pass it up.  I've found myself getting into the idea of Gothic novels and was quite interested...<br /><br />By the end of this reading experience (for it is an experience), I had been shocked so many times it was almost impossible not to give it five stars on the spot.  But not only did it shock me - it made me love it, incredibly so.  I love this book; and for that, five stars in inevitable.<br /><br />Character notes -<br />The second Mrs. de Winter is quite extraordinary, for many reasons.  One is her name in and of itself.  I say this because she does not have one.  As the story is told in first person, she does not introduce herself;  her name is mentioned once as being hard to spell, that people usually get it wrong; and after she marries Max she is called by everyone she knows as \\"Mrs. de Winter\\".  It was quite shocking for me to discover half-way through the book, that I had missed her first name, and I that I was such a terrible reader for missing such an important detail like that.  I re-read parts of the beginning, asked around and discovered the truth:  she has no first name because it is not important.  What is important is that she is the second Mrs. de Winter.<br />Besides that, she amazed me by totally getting on my nerves sometimes and still being a fantastic character who I could relate to and love.  How did she annoy me?  Her lack of ability to speak out sometimes drove me up the wall with thoughts of, \\"Goodness!  Why won't she just say something?!  After being so ill-treated!\\"  But it was her character; she became like a friend; I could love her in spite of that fault (and whatever others to her name...or lack thereof).  And in the end - well, she's quite the lioness at the end.  I love books with changed heroes/heroines. :D<br /><br />Besides Mrs. de Winter, the other characters are so perfectly drawn for the reader that it is hard to forget them.  Frank (one of my top three favorites - he was soooo awesome), Maxim's sister, Max himself, Mrs. Danvers, and Favell especially, but there are others, and they, too, are profound.<br /><br />And Rebecca, even being a mere ghost of a character, is still shockingly real.  Everything about her made my skin crawl - and I didn't even know why.  You won't know why either.  There is no exact reason why I felt that way, and you will wonder... Oh, you will wonder.<br /><br />Story notes -<br />This is such a unique story - and so weird.  Everything happened in a way that made me weirded out with no real explanation whatsoever as to why.  (See above comment on the character Rebecca.)  And then - BOOM!  There's an explosion, and you'll be holding on for dear life, becausethere's no possible way this could really be happening.<br /><br />At least, that's how I felt.  I was on an airplane when I read the climax - the EXPLOSION - and holy crud don't ever do that.  Confined to a chair with quiet people all around me and flight attendants scanning the rows with narrowed eyes, searching for disturbance of any kind  - yeah, don't ever try it.  Best to wait until you've landed, read it when you get home, and whoop and holler and scream and stare in shocked silence as much as you want.  All I could do was hyperventilate in a very quiet manner.  Haha - just kidding!  Sort of.<br /><br />Summing it up -<br />Shocking, to say the least.  I did not expect it to be the way it was, with the writing style or the set-up or the conflict or the climax or the resolution.  All of it was unexpected and perfect.  Please, do yourself a favor and read this book, now.  Unless you have the tendency to scream when shocked and are currently on an airplane.  If this unfortunate combination applies to you, please wait until you have reached a safe environment before expression appropriate feelings of exuberance and/or show signs of sudden startled or disconcerted emotions.<br /><br />For the Parents -<br />This is a classic, and should be treated as such (which means everyone should read it at least once).  However, themes are slightly more mature, and I wouldn't recommend to anyone younger than 15.  Some brief strong language and lots of...death.  But I can't say anything else!! ;)there's no possible way this could really be happening.<br /><br />At least, that's how I felt.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|\\"My family thinks I'm this giant loser,\\" Kevin Spacey informs the audience minutes into \\"American Beauty\\", the black-humored saga of a man who has lost touch with his family and realizes it only too well, \\"and they're right.\\"  This could also apply to Matt King, George Clooney's character, in \\"The Descendants.\\"  Despite residing on a Hawaiian island, there is plenty of trouble in paradise.  He's in the midst of a real estate deal that the entire island is watching; his wife (Patricia Hastie) is on life support following a boating accident; and his two daughters (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller) are acting out.  He's never been the family disciplinarian, and their lack of respect perpetually baffles him.  Further complicating things, King realizes that his wife has been unfaithful with someone (Matthew Lillard) who he's never met but has direct ties to the land deal.  This may sound like grim subject matter, but it's handled deftly and with more than a touch of black humor. \\"If you're doing this to get my attention, Liz, it's working,\\" Clooney says to his wife during one hospital visit.  When a visitor begins to have a breakdown, he takes her by the shoulders and steers her out.    Many movies begin strongly and go downhill in quality; but this film improves as it goes on, and the last 20 minutes had me blubbering (and I don't cry at movies).  The only thing is: that although pains have been taken to make Clooney look like an ordinary guy, I still had trouble believing that he was part of the same gene pool as his movie \\"cousins.\\"  But that was a minor point in an otherwise poignant and heartbreaking movie.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|Having grown up watching the original Christmas Carol, and all the versions made, we were hesitant to give this one a try. Jim Carrey has a very specific type of humor, and we were not sure it would translate well into the character of Scrooge. To our amazement, he did quite well and did not let his wry humor overwhelm his character. We were entertained enough to order the DVD. Is it the best version ever made of the Christmas Carol? No. However, it is worth a watch as, with each version of the movie, it has its only little twists that add background to the story.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|When one reads both the book and then sees the movie, most likely there are changes to adapt to the wide screen. So it is with this movie.  Like most of us, we often believe the book better; however the movie did bring a different level of poignancy and understanding of a terrible time in history; along with a blight upon France for its role in sending thousands of Jews to their death.  A serious movie, a good one and one not to forget.

0761129235|2.0|This is not a book written with careful consideration and research but much more like an author's essay.  The contents can be summarized in one page, even a few sentences; \\"Break a big work into small chunks and solve them.  Do not aim grand slam but single hits.  That's all it says.  I agree what he says, but it is quite misleading to connect to Japanese Kaizen and their achievement.<br />If you work with Japanese companies (I do), you will realize that their working styles are quite different from the others.  They work in groups always, do numerous impromptus small meetings everywhere (because of their open office) , which provides so many chances  for them to exchange small thoughts and ideas. On the contrary the \\"official\\" meeting in the conference room is much like a ceremony since all the employees know what will be discussed and what are the outcomes.  There is no private working environment (except a few managers' class).  You will learn that environment is a big contributor to improve their working environment little by little, day by day.  They even discuss copy machine setups to minimize the loss of paper together and share the \\"ownership\\" of the working environment.<br />To understand Japanese Kaizen, you need to learn their behavior and way of thinking, which some of them will not be acceptable for non-Japanese.  I believe leveraging their achievement is possible, however, this requires careful research and understanding what are behind them.  This type of book, which seems to be a quick easy fix and just to advocate small continuous improvement, mislead readers and ruin the opportunities to learn from different culture seriously.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I work on a tugboat and wanted to take my xbox with me. The G155 works perfectly. It sits at the end of my bunk, bout 7 feet away. Takes about 5 minutes to set up.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've been looking for some really good headphones for a while now, and after much looking, I impulsively bought these. After a few days of worrying that they wouldn't be all they were hyped up to be, they finally arrived. After reading some Audiophile forums, I found that its good to \\"break in\\" your head phones by just letting them play music at a medium level for a few hours. Outa the box, these things were awesome. At first the bass was a tad muddy, but a half hour of play time cleaned that up. Five hours later they sound even better. They have a 55 ohm Independence, which for non-techie people means that it takes a bit of juice to runs these, but I've been playing them all day on my iPod, and the battery life has barley dropped. They are really comfy, 5 hours in and it still feels nice, no head crunching pressure. My only complaints are the fit on your head, and the cord. They are a tad lose due to the auto adjust system that fits snugly to your head. It's really comfy, but if you start looking around every where they will slip and slid a little. The cord is the most annoying feature. At 9 ft long it can get in the way, but just stuffing the excess to the bottom of your pocket fixes that, defiantly not a deal breaker. Overall, I'm Highly impressed with these headphones. They give off enough sound from an ipod to cover up average conversation, which is great if your in college and wanna have some peace away from your roomies when your studying (I'll have to test this next year). I'd Highly recommend them for any one from the casual user the music junkie, these \\"Cans\\" are awesome.

1594744769|5.0|Sixteen-year-old Jacob had an interesting grandfather.  Had, because one night, in the woods behind his home, something strange killed the older man.  Jacob is now going to Wales in search of the orphanage his grandfather grew up.  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children could be anywhere, or nowhere in Wales, yet Jacob has only known what his grandfather has told him.  These children have been isolated on the once deserted island because society deemed them a danger, but never revealed to whom.  Just what Jacob will do if he finds the orphanage?  Jacob has no idea.  He wants answers.  Who killed his grandfather?  Or, what killed him?<br /><br />This book is eerie from the beginning, before reading one word.  The photographs on the front and back cover, plus the ones inside the book, are more than pictures of circus freaks.  They are sometimes difficult photographs to look at, while some are merely strange.  None is funny.  The story is another paranormal, but without vampires and werewolves.  This one is so different, you will be clinging to the pages as you turn them quickly so as not to miss a word.  At times, this reminds me of Stephen King's version of Ray Bradbury's  Something Wicked This Way Comes not only in the freakish characters but also in the tightness of the writing.  Not one word is wasted.<br /><br />I waited a long time to get my copy of Miss Peregrine and it was worth the wait.  If there is an older kid, or teen, who has not already read this imaginative work of fiction, this book would make a great gift.  While it is a strange, or rather, a peculiar story, it does not scare in a way that will cause any nightmares.  The story is a cut above the usual middle grade book and some kids may not be ready for this yet.  Those that are, will enjoy the storyline, the characters, and the oddness that Mr. Riggs has brought to the pages.  If you like mysteries with a bit of absurdity (the photographs, each fitting into the story), Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the story for you.  I was not disappointed and neither will you.  This is sure to make to top list for 2011.<br /><br />note: received from publishers the story for you.  I was not disappointed and neither will you.  This is sure to make to top list for 2011.   note: received from publisher

I can't think of one thing about Run Into Flowers I don't love and I can't find one thing about this music I don't absolutely despise. I just... I don't understand how this could happen. M83, why?

0060873027|5.0|A classic Crichton novel has the following ingredients: far fetched and not so far fetched scientific theories explained in simple to understand terms and knitted together in a plausible plot,believable characters,screenplay friendly style of writing and a riveting climax. 'Micro' fits all these requirements, and Richard Preston completes Michael Crichton's unfinished novel seamlessly.The story of the protagonists caught in a microscopic world has been told before in movies like 'The Fantastic Voyage' and even in 'Honey I Shrunk The Kids'. What sets 'Micro' apart is the attention to detail and the fascinating entomological world the authors have created with relish. In fact, in an unfinished preface to the book, Crichton laments the loss of interest and the sense of detachment the younger generation has for the wonders of Nature.    Crichton and Preston brilliantly weave the story in the backdrop of the fascinating world of insects and other creatures whose world we tend to ignore just because we outsize them in girth-though not in numbers.In reality insects are the most abundant form of life on earth. Yet they are able to live symbiotically with other creatures and vegetation regardless of whether they are predators or prey-in contrast to humans.    Richard Preston needs to be commended for making Crichton's spirit live on- though sadly, this is reportedly Crichton's last unfinished manuscript.

As my title indicated, I did love the book and have recommended and even bought it as a gift for others. The ending had to be, for the story to work, and to break my heart; call me a romantic but I really wanted Sadie and Jake to be together in the end and not as an 80 year and a 40 year old.   Read this book if you are from the 50's or 60's generation (reminiscing about the good and bad ol' days), have a fascination with the Kennedy assassination (did Lee Harvey act alone?), enjoy a thriller (Jimla and the Green Card Men), or want to have your heart broken by a bunch of fictional characters (Damn you King!) :-(

B005KA188S|4.0|In an age of cruddy, needless remakes coming out seemingly every other week, the fact that the Fright Night remake is surprisingly good is quite refreshing indeed.  The basic premise of the original remains the same, as high schooler Charlie (Anton Yelchin) suspects his neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a blood-thirsty vampire when denziens of his Vegas suburb begin to go missing.  Things begin to go from bad to worse as Charlie's mother (Toni Collete) and gorgeous girlfriend (Imogen Poots) get caught in the crossfire, leading him to seek out the assistance of horror illusionist Peter Vincent (David Tennant) as things reach a bloody climax.  Alterations to the original film's story aside, this new take on Fright Night works, and delivers the goods for those looking for real vampire thrills in this age of sparkling teenage vamps that take too much care of their hair.  Colin Farrell acts every bit the predator vamp, and the great David \\"Dr. Who\\" Tennant steals the whole show here.  While it isn't perfect and leaves a little to be desired (i.e., some of the CGI effects are pretty lame looking), Fright Night is a bloody good time regardless.  All in all, if you're a fan of the original film, check this out, you may find yourself pleasently surprised.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Super 8 - This movie is a cross between Stand By Me, and E.T. with some Cloverfield thrown in for some intense action. It has all the makings (and perhaps the pitfalls) of a `summer blockbuster' hit; tense moments, high action, laughs, drama, and over-the-top special FX.  At the center of the story is a group of young kids trying to make an amateur film for a film contest. I completely identified with this group of youngsters struggling for accomplishment and battling the forces that be to get it done. The young cast was considerably talented playing each of their characters to believable perfection. Quite a few reviews here had questions and negative comments about the alien and its motives. I think perhaps  they were expecting a Riddley Scott `Alien' type of movie. Like all `fantastic story' films, if you look too close you will find imperfections, that`s just the nature of the beast. In the end this movie was really about a group of kids forced to grow up very quickly when faced with a serious situation. I enjoyed this film very much.<br />* Make sure you sit through the end credits to see the completed `Super-8 film' submission.

B0001Z37HM|3.0|Take this movie with a grain of salt and you will enjoy it a lot more. It's a bizarre save the world fantasy tale. The story does not have a lot of suspense. The characters are not well developed enough for you to actually care about them. BUT. It turns out to be one of those so bad it's good films. The sets are hilarious. The acting is terrible. The fighting is horrendous. I had to double check that this wasn't directed by Uwe Boll. If you go into this with no expecations, you'll be entertained by its ridiculousness and the fact that it takes itself so seriously.

B003L77GG0|4.0|This season really wraps up 10 years of story line. There are some really good episodes. The best is an episode you could call \\"The Smallville Hangover\\". It is very funny, and just like the movie \\"The Hangover\\". Another episode, directed by Justin Hartley (aka Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) is probably the best episode of the season. The only reason I say that it isn't as good as season 9 is that they linger on one topic (I won't say what, as not to ruin it for ya'll) for TOO MANY EPISODES. There are some surprise guest stars, and some surprise 'blasts from the past'. If you are a true Smallville/Superman/DC fan, you will really get a kick out of this season. I DO recommend it. Just, don't be expecting it to be fantastic...If you ask me, Season Nine is the best season out of all of them. But Season 10 won't disappoint, as long as you don't expect it to be season 9.
B000SKNIWE|5.0|Wonderful! The contents are enriching and powerful! The message and ability to learn from this series is real and keep you gasping for more! Love every moment of it! Makes one appreciate the natural environment and all it contains a lot more after watching this... Great work!
0780021967|3.0|An interesting look at Hitchcocks's early work, you can defiantly see some of the tropes that would become common in his later career. There are some great uses of sound (most uniquely the transition of the train whistle) and POV. 39 Steps also has an interesting (if not entirely realistic) story that generates the suspense Alfred is known for.  Where the film drops the ball is the characters and the acting. At no point was I the least concerned with the fate of Hanney. This could be because the character never stays consistent. At one moment he is the everyman put in a wild position trying to be just ahead of his pursuers to stay alive, the next he's a super genius who gayly bounces witty banter back and forth with Pamela. It's enjoyable, but it also lessens the suspense. What isn't enjoyable is Pamela, who as a character is both annoying and entirely forgettable.   39 steps isn't a terrible film by any stretch, but it also isn't a great one.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|saw this movie back in the 80's and thought it was cool, got both versions to watch and compare.  however, re-watching it as 'adults' didn't find the original as entertaining as we once did and the ending just leaves you hanging.  can't say that the 'new' one impressed us either.  we care for younger children and they enjoyed them.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Quite possibly the most quotable film of all time, Die Hard is almost a thinking man's mindless action flick. Bruce Willis plays the films super-everyman John McClane who can make witty remarks moments after snapping a terrorists neck. Alan Rickman plays a career defining role as the villain Hans Grubber who is cold, calculating, and threatening. It's fun to watch these two face off, Hans's brain vs John's brawn. We see Hans's men get pick off one by one and John gets more and more beat up. The secondary characters are great to. Reginarld VelJohnson as the shell shocked cop, Bonnie Bedelia as the tough wife, and William Atherton as...well, William Atherton. The most stand out of the secondary characters, however, has got to be Hart Brocher as the ULTIMATE 80's guy Harry Ellis. This is one film you can watch again and again, and it even works as a great Christmas movie.
B005DC68NI|4.0|As David Gaughran's Let's Get Digital has been described at length in other reviews, I won't waste the space to reiterate those descriptions, but I will repeat the compliments: as a guide to the rapidly shifting landscape that is publishing and e-publishing, it would be difficult to do a better job than LGD.   Gaughran takes a set of fairly expansive and esoteric topics (publishing, its apparent demise, and the rise of epublishing to take its place) and lays out not just the modern-day environment in easy to understand terms--a bookworthy topic itself--he acts as a trustworthy guide and pathfinder for the beginning writer in this jungle. An indispensable help to newbies in the field that need an orientation.  A second edition could use more exacting details on the pains of e-formatting as well as the tools and merits of doing so. I also enjoyed the 33 successful digital authors' testimonies in the back of the book, but would've appreciated some more in-depth promotion examples and advice. For these reasons, I gave LGD 4 stars, but would've given it 4.5 if I could ;)  A great effort and a handbook that should be on everyone's digital shelf.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Does the path of perfection lead to self improvement or self destruction? That is the main theme running through Black Swan, which also deals with themes of sexual repression, pseudo-reality, and the dangers of stardom. Aronofsky seems to have a fascination with the disturbing and the artistic, both of which are great descriptions for what Black Swan is. The basic story is about how the sickly sweet Nina (played quite well by Portman) struggles to release the \\"bad girl\\" inside her in order to play the titular Black Swan and thus become a star. Things get surreal as the stress takes it's toll on Nina, and it becomes hard to tell what's real and what isn't.  It's an intriguing premise that's backed up with great music, choreography, and acting, along with some truly disturbing moments. Where this film loses points is it's nausea inducing camerawork (I don't think handheld works in every movie, Darren) and it's general \\"I'm so artsy\\" pretentious feel. other then those very minor and perhaps personal complaints, this is a very good movie that should be seen.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|Wonderful dvd.  Sting is a goofball in his interviews, but forget about it, his performances both in rehearsal and concert are astounding.  And Omar, did I mention Omar?  His drumming is fabulous all the way through.  Two of the best all time solo performances perhaps ever captured on dvd are herein:  1) Omar's drum solo on 'I burn for you'.  2) Branford's sax (clarinet??) solo on 'Children's crusade.'  I've watched this probably 20 times at least and still love it.  Stings rendition of 'message in a bottle' closes the dvd out and tugs at heart every time...
0385340990|5.0|I was one of the people swayed by the negative reviews saying it was fluffy, the characters were stiff and caricatures........so I skipped reading it when I first came across it.  This book found it's way to me because of my bookswap so I figured it would be a much deserved light read reward after a hard semester reading literature I really didn't want, but learned to love.  I am only half way through this book and LOVE IT.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this book then just look at all the high star recommendations. Just read it, it's a short read and honestly I have fallen in love with the characters and cannot put this down. In our world no one can please everybody and there will always be plenty of MISS Addison's in the world (you'll understand this reference if you read the book) and that is who I imagine wrote some of those dreadful one star reviews of this book (hee hee and quoted the wrong author and character names) *A Big Chuckle*.<br /><br />If you are looking for a light, warm-hearted read (I have no idea how this ends) then pick this up.  If you are a person who can suspend belief, enjoys reading letters and the correspondence of lives interwoven through circumstance then I think you would love this book.  I didn't find the characters stiff or flat in any sense - this book drew me in almost from page one and I'm ducking in and out of work trying to finish it because I want to know what happens.<br /><br />Some of the reviews I read complained about how quick the post was, that a certain name would never have been used in Great Britain blah blah blah blah - SERIOUSLY????????<br /><br />I think this book is fabulous and would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />At worst, if you don't like it, you've spent a couple hours imagining a different time, experiences hopefully we'll never have to endure. I Highly recommend this book!

1932100660|1.0|I became vegetarian when I was ~15.  I was never a perfect vegetarian, more like ~95% veg.  Then in my later years of vegetarianism I become more and more vegan.  At some point I read this book and believed it, hook line and sinker.  That was part of my justification for switching to a more vegan diet.  Plus I find factory farming to be disgusting and so avoiding all products from factory farms seemed like a good idea to me.  Over this time my health suffered as a consequence of this diet.  Because I thought my diet was the healthiest diet possible, after reading the likes of The China Study and John Robbins, I never suspected my diet was to blame.  But then, as a lark, I decided to try a paleo way of eating, mostly to prove how stupid it is.  I really thought it was crazy at the time.  But lo and behold, I felt much better on paleo than I ever did eating vegan.  Now I've read more of the science of the \\"other\\" side and I've read the critiques of the China study by Chris Masterjohn and Denise Minger and feel pretty stupid for ever believing all the hooey in this book.  And I suffered for many years because of it.  I know that the Vegan propagandists are doing what they THINK is right, but they are wrong and I suffered due to their misguided spreading of falsehoods.  Please, don't follow this diet.  It is BAD for your health.  It seems like it's a good idea for so many reasons, but they are all false.  Read the Vegetarian Myth to find out more of the non-health based reasons why the arguments for Veganism/Vegetarianism don't really hold sway when you really take them to their logical conclusions.
B0062A5RUA|2.0|Of all the vocalists Slash has played with From Axl to the Boys in snakepit to all the guest vocalists on the last solo, Miles Kennedy has one of the weakest , whiniest voices of them all. His contributions on the solo CD were pretty good but no way can he power through the material that Slash plays. Slash is one of the most talented, versatile guitarists of this generation Not always the fastest, not always the hardest but almost always tasteful as hell. Kennedy just doesn't have the range to keep up.

B002PMV9K6|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was a very good movie as were all the Harry potter movies. The film kept very close to the book and stayed true to the characters. I have really enjoyed watching the kids that play the main characters grow up in this series of films. If you have read this book then you must treat yourself to the movie, you will be glad you did.
B003QS9VYE|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />The best creations of book, cinema, play, in my opinion, realistically and painstakingly portray the indomitablity and ultimate triumph of hope.  Disney's emotional classic \\"Dumbo\\" certainly qualifies.  It follows the progress of the ultimate underdog, an abandoned, ostracized baby elephant, as he gradually finds his lofty place in the world.  Yes, he has guidance and inspiration from an unlikely ally, Timothy J. Mouse, but at the climax, Dumbo must find it within himself to overcome his sadness and fear to literally soar.<br /><br />Your heart aches for this cute pachyderm and the adversity he faces - pompous, sneering fellow circus elephants, cruel children, a bombastic ringmaster, callous circus clowns.  It seems that everybody in the world is against him, except his mother of course.  But then she is imprisoned for going on a rampage against the children taunting her baby, and Dumbo figuratively but practically becomes an orphan.  His last sliver of hope vanishes.  But the movie reassures us that even outcasts can take hope and comfort, usually from other outcasts.  Timothy J. Mouse, though the movie only implies this, is just such an outcast.  Who wants a mouse at a circus, or anywhere else?  Even elephants are allegedly afraid of them (is that actually true?)  But Dumbo and Tim hit it off.  Together, they even devise a plan to rocket Dumbo to the top - an elephant pyramid show Tim subliminally suggests to the snoring ringmaster.  Hope rises, but then plummets as Dumbo's ears cause the pyramid and circus to literally collapse.<br /><br />As punishment, Dumbo is forced to be a clown in a humiliating and dangerous high-dive act.  The act is successful, but Dumbo is naturally despondent, for he knows he has hit bottom.  It takes Tim's arrangement of a visit to his chained mother, and one of the most poignant songs on Earth, \\"Baby Mine\\", to restore Dumbo's spirits a little.  Some spilled champagne from the celebrating clowns sends Dumbo's spirits really high and crush his inhibitions, so the next day he finds himself up a tree with some cackling crows.  But how?<br /><br />Even natural crows are outcasts in a way.  They are noisy and eat carrion.  But these cartoon crows are caricatures of African-Americans.  But I don't think they are disparaging portrayals.  Instead, I think they are meant to portray the alienation many African-Americans still felt during the '40s.  Even so, they make fun of Dumbo as he topples from the tree.  Only when Tim tells the crows of Dumbo's hard knock life do the birds stop making fun of him, a fellow outcast.  How did Dumbo get up that tree?  The only explanation, bizarre as it is, is that he FLEW! Can he fly again? The crows offer a solution with a \\"magic feather\\".  Dumbo grasps the magic feather and grandly flies.  The high-diving act is gonna be different this time.<br /><br />At the act's climax, Dumbo dives but loses the feather.  Hope plummets again.  But Tim yells at him that it isn't within the feather, it's witnin HIM to fly, all along.  Dumbo listens, and soars for real, and gets some relatively gentle but satisfying payback at his tormentors.  The circus has a new star, Tim hits the big time, and mother and son are reunited.  All within an hour.<br /><br />\\"Dumbo\\" is a fantasy that nevertheless grittingly earns its happy ending, and reassures that, whoever we are, and whatever our circumstances, with courage and hope, we can go up, too!<br /><br />P.S.: Very minor error - Dumbo is shown drinking the alcohol-flavored water by sucking it through his trunk like a straw.  Actually, in real life, elephants suck up water through their trunk and spray it into their mouths.  As I said, a very minor error in this wonderful film.really high and crush his inhibitions, so the next day he finds himself up a tree with some cackling crows.  But how?

0345522478|5.0|I must admit that when I was searching for a new series to read and I stumbled upon this book I was a little hesitant. I haven't seen and/or read many books within this genre that were written by a man and were truly engaging. I am so glad to have taken a chance on this author because all three Iron Druid books up to this point have been absolutely amazing. I was so enthralled with the characters, setting, everything that I could not put the books down. Plus the fact that there is an actual dog in the book that acts like a dog (no pampered pooches whose feet never touch the ground here) was very nice to see. I have always admired the Irish Wolfhound and well pretty much any canine that dealt with wolves and or looked wolfish (like my beloved Keeshonden).   If you are thinking about getting this book, do so, you won't be sorry!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I've enjoyed most of the Marvel movies very much, but this is my hands down favorite, not only among the Marvel movies, but I mean this is my favorite movie period. I can't say enough about the costumes, the casting, the beauty of Asgard and the soundtrack. Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Odin and since seeing the movie in May when it opened, I have not been able to get his version of Odin out of my head when I read the comics. Chris Hemsworth is perfect physically and in his performance. The rest of the cast is awesome, too, but it would be impossible to say in words how absolutely PERFECT Tom Hiddleston is as Loki. That is the most brilliant casting ever. He brings so much depth to Loki. For me, he makes the whole movie.<br /><br />My only complaint about the blu-ray is that it just doesn't have enough bonus stuff on it. I was hoping it would have much, much more in the way of bonus stuff. The deleted scenes are great, and the featurettes are, too, I just wish there were way more of them. I also wish they would have added a feature about the comic book history of Thor, maybe something about the Norse myths, and way more interviews and features.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I recently purchased season one and two for $12.99 and $8.99 respectively during the Black Friday week hoopla.  I had previously watched the seasons on loan from my local library but for this price I couldn't say no.<br /><br />Season one is decidedly better than season two, though both are brilliant.  This series is brought to you from the same folks that were responsible for the Emmy hungry series Frasier.  The same brilliance in characterization, writing, and acting is present here as well.  I would expect nothing less from Levitan and Lloyd (not the Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future!).<br /><br />If you haven't seen this series, then I will touch briefly on the premise. Especially since they don't really tell you on the show... but on the extras and the website they explain it.<br /><br />Apparently a Scandinavian film crew wants to document an average, extended American family for either a series or a documentary to be shown in their home country.  We never see the crew, and it has a feel similar to 'The Office' where the characters often deliver monologues to the camera or have funny little looks at the camera during scenes.<br /><br />There are three households.  The patriarch is Jay Pritchett.  He divorced and was married to a much younger and very attractive Colombian woman named Gloria.  She brings her son from her previous marriage, Manny.  Jay's son, Mitchell, is gay and lives with his partner Cam and their adopted daughter Lily.  Jay's daughter, Claire, is married to Phil Dunphy and they have two girls and one boy.  So we see one somewhat conventional appearing household(that might be the most dysfunctional!) and two unconventional households.  Cue hilarity.<br /><br />A lot of the humor is based on awkward moments, and we see each of the household's struggle with their own share of problems.  What ties everything together is their affection for each other.  Not obvious up front, but we see through their interactions that despite sometimes being short with one another they really are a caring bunch.<br /><br />The first season has some great moments, real laugh out loud moments.  I have struggled with new sitcoms but this is a truly funny show.  If you don't laugh out loud with Dylan starts playing his song for Haley in front of the family, then I'm wrong.<br /><br />The acting is top notch, especially Ty Burrell (Phil Dunphy) and Eric Stonestreet (Cam).  I think they both won Emmy's, deservingly so.  And I like that like Friends, none of the cast would submit their Emmy nominations for Best Lead Actor or Actress, only supporting.<br /><br />A funny, often heartwarming show about an unconventional family that somehow makes it work.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games, an action and adventure novel, is a great read for teens. The main characters, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, are thrown into the annual Hunger Games of the dystopian world of Panem and forced to survive by killing fellow tributes.   The novel has a tense and dark tone. Since it is written in first-person, we see the events through Katniss's eyes. She is constantly feeling pressure to survive the Games. She is also saddened and scared of the Capitol's cruel actions and knows that there is little chance of surviving their wrath. The reader's mood throughout the novel is also tense and dark. A reader would be constantly worrying about Katniss and her welfare in the chaotic arena.   Overall, I liked the book because it tells a story of a normal, relatable girl who is thrust into the role of being a hero. Being sixteen, Katniss is the same, or a similar age, of the reader. She is still questioning her role in life and whether she will continue to be the main provider for her family once her world is turned upside down by the Hunger Games.   A major theme is the sacrifice for one's family and friends. Katniss shows the ultimate sacrifice when she sacrifices her life by volunteering in Prim's place as tribute in the Hunger Games. Sacrifice, no matter the price, is a good theme to in real life. It shows teens that they can use the act of sacrifice in their own lives.  I liked the Katniss's character progression in the book. Katniss began as a strong provider for her family. As her journey throughout the Hunger Games progressed, we saw her go from celebrity to potential rebellion-starter. She developed her strength as a fighter and showed Panem that she was not a force to be reckoned with.  Suzanne Collins did a great job relating Roman history to the novel. Most teens do not read for fun, much less want to learn through reading. Collins combines the best of both worlds by using history as a gateway for the incredible new world of Panem.  One change Collins could have made would have been to add more of a back-story to President Snow and his Capitol. Is he a dictator or a monarch? How long has he actually ruled Panem? These questions and more would have been a great addition to the story that might have explained more of a motive for how the Dark Days came about and its subsequent events.
0545157617|2.0|Stick man gets seperated from his Stick family via all the things you might see a stick involved in or you'd do with a stick (fetch with a dog; drop in a stream with other sticks for a race, etc).  I ordered this thru our Schoolastic account and can't recall what the description said that made me think \\"Oooo! this will be fun\\".  Nope.  Boring and uninteresting....nice that Stick Man ends up on a pile of wood to go into a fireplace (Uh-oh Stick Man fell asleep on a pile of wood! What's going to happen to him?!) but wakes up to hear that Santa's stuck in the chimney.  Stick Man lends a hand and as a result finally gets back to his own family.  So, I guess the moral is to do good deeds and you'll be rewarded.  But still, very unimaginative.  I'd suggest that this book might be exciting to a toddler/early pre-school, but really dull to a kindergartener.  Not a terrible book, but there's much better out there that would be more of a hit than this.  Buy if you simply LOVE sticks.
B000P0J0AG|4.0|Billed as a showdown between two big screen giants, Heat is better construed as a platform for Robert DeNiro at his understated best, while Al Pacino goes over the top with pre-adolesecnt cliches' from the '60's, maybe even earlier.  (\\"Junior G-Man badge!\\"  Please.)  DeNiro's portrayal of a high-end thief with a disciplined gang of no-nonsense professionals is exemplary.  Pacino's efforts to bring to life a high-ranking but still street-wise and tough cop with more brains than most big-time criminals falls flat, in part because of Pacino's frantically lack-luster performance, and in part because of the script.  The good lines and best scenes were written for DeNiro.<br /><br />Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, and even the usually annoying Tom Sizemore do their work well as DeNiro's comrades in arms.  Each comes with baggage of one kind or another, but all make a determined and convincing effort to adhere to DeNiro's business-first maxim.  The professionalism of DeNiro's crew is manifest in their attention to detail, preparation for the kind of misadventure that comes with the territory, and their unwillingness to tolerate needless violence.  None of them is so reckless or greedy that he can't walk away from a big score while erring on the side of caution.<br /><br />In comparison, Pacino's cops are sadly ordinary.  Maybe the stakes are not as high for them, but whatever the reason, they come across as, at best, plodding functionaries who can do their job pretty well as long as the bad guys are predictable, a bit clumsy, and given to over-reaching.  Maybe they all have the same kinds of domestic difficulties as Pacino, whose wife wants a life that means more than waiting for him to come home for an hour or two from time to time.  Diane Venora is a talented actress who is unfortunately wasted in the thankless role of neglected and nagging spouse.  One wonders why she doesn't just dump Pacino and move on.<br /><br />The first time I watched Heat I expected that DeNiro's downfall, if there was one, would stem from his feelings for the sort of woman he never expected to meet, played ably by Amy Brenneman.  Could he drop everything, her included, and walk away without hesitation if circumstances demanded it?  Maybe so, but maybe he would luck out and be able to avoid that kind of decision.<br /><br />Furthermore, could DeNiro's character walk away without wreaking vengeance on a snitch?  Or is this need even stronger than his feeling for Amy Brenneman?  Hard to tell.  DeNiro is a disciplined, determined, and experienced criminal, but he's not one-dimensional.<br /><br />This 1995 movie gives us Robert DeNiro at his mature best, while Pacino, looking sort of dissipated, is having an off day.  Fortunately, the action scenes focus mainly on DeNiro and his crew, and they are well choreographed and exciting.  DeNiro's performance and the work of his M-16 toting partners make this a movie worth watching.  I've seen it half dozen time and still enjoy it.ll, if there was one, would stem from his feelings for the sort of woman he never expected to meet, played ably by Amy Brenneman.

B005HI4LLY|4.0|This is one of those small indi-films that Magnolia puts out on HDNet, Pay-per-view and DVD at about the same time as it hits theaters.  This is a hilarious spoof of all those high school/college age kids who meet their doom in the woods at the hand of inbred hillbillies.  The tables are turned this time as Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and his best friend Dale (Tyler Labine) head out to their new \\"vacation home\\" deep in the West Virginia woods.  A gaggle of college kids are also planning on a little camping and relaxation from the grind of their studies.  Initially the two groups run into each other at a gas station loading up on vittles and beer.  Tucker and Dale fit the killer redneck profile to a tee, but are actually sweet simpletons happy with their fate in life and the fact that they have their wreck of a cabin - a fixer-upper - (previously owned by a serial killer based on the decorative treatments including a wall full of horrifying newspaper clippings).<br /><br />In the late afternoon, while fishing near a spot the college kids decide to go skinny dipping, Tuck and Dale  rescue one of the coeds who slipped and hit her head on her way into the lake.  They put her in the boat, while the rest of the college kids run away in fear.  With no other simple option Tuck and Dale take the comely lass (Katrina Bowden from \\"30 Rock\\") back to their cabin unconscious.  Let me digress here for a minute and note that Ms. Bowden is a decent actress but has an Olympic class bare midriff that is terribly distracting for most of the film, so be forewarned.  The remaining college kids under the leadership of Chad (Jesse Moss) decide to rescue Allison (Bowden).  After a couple self inflicted impalements, Tucker muses, \\"those college kids must have a suicide pact.\\"<br /><br />This film will keep you laughing throughout with some memorable one-liners.  It also has a full amount of blood and guts but the nudity is minimal and in the distance. This film is certainly better than most comedies I've seen this year.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read this long book in Kindle Format and I couln't stop reading it, night after night. I think it's a real, crude and neutral view of Steve Job's life, written in a very tidy way full with anecdotes that for us, technology guys, are quite interesting.<br /><br />The personal life of Mr. Jobs was, until now, a total mistery for almost everyone. This book allowed us to have a glimpse inside him as a real person, as a family guy.<br /><br />Also, it brings a lot of key thoughts from this Tech Gur&uacute;, really valuable for me.<br /><br />Great book! The only part missing of the Kindle version is the big and clear photos.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|In terms of the series of three Bourne, this does move the story forward a bit, but, in essence, it is a repetition of the Bourne Identity: lots of good action scenes, less plot meat than the little in Identity, and an entirely superficial approach to character. Nonetheless, it can be quite entertaining if you do not see it in a double feature with the first (for the repetition of action might well become boring). On the other hand, if you have not yet seen Bourne Identity, then you can expect some exciting urban chase scenes. The acting is highly stereotyped but quite suitable to the demands of the script.. films
B001EN71CW|4.0|Firefly is basically a space western with great characters and adventures -- it's something that my husband and I watched on Netflix streaming and loved every episode -- delighted to be able to have it to keep and bring out every once in a while.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the BEST books I've read in a long time! The character development and plot really suck you into the story. You actually feel as if you've known the characters all your life! You can feel intense love/compassion that Peeta has for Katniss. This is definitely a quick read that you cannot/do not want to put down! I highly recommend this book. Can't wait to finish Catching Fire! Movie comes out March 23rd!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not huge Stephen King fan, however this book had me way before it was even released.  The story is so much more than John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald.  I absolutely loved all the twists and turns leading to 11/22/63.  The characters that SK had in the book were just amazining and you felt like you were best friends with them.  Jake/George was such a great character and such a believable person. By the end of the book, i didn't want it to end!<br /><br />Don't let the amount of pages scare you, every page was worth readying.

0385732554|4.0|I find it hard to believe that this book is \\"bad literature.\\" Don't believe the low-star reviews by kids who will not understand the deeper meaning, advanced ideas and vocaulary, or grammar. Of course it will be boring to younger kids because there is no \\"BOOM! CRASH!\\" action like The Hunger Games. Everyone I knew who has read it enjoyed it very much because it made them think about lots of things. And, yes, it's disturbing and dark. Why wouldn't it be? It's a DYSTOPIAN NOVEL. Not a utopian novel. And boring? Well, it depends. If you wanted to see Jonas and the Giver go all out and battle people, it's not going to happen. The reason why Jonas decided to just leave was to 1) save Gabe and 2) have the people begin to remember the memories and deal with them. And no, parents, Jonas doesn't commit suicide. He's suffering from hypothermia with various other afflictions. Perhaps some are talking about Rosemary, but the fact is is that she wasn't strong enough to bear centuries worth of pain and suffering. And, yes, the \\"release\\" was really sickening and horrifying. It was supposed to, and the kids I know were looking pretty ill, too. Parents have the right to read and judge for themselves whether it will be an appropriate book for kids, but it's a good, thought-provoking book for young adults.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|This is 300 multiplied 300 times. I'm a Tarsem fan and expected great visuals, weak story. He had wanted to make the 300 film but Zach Snyder beat him to it. They are apparently friends, so no big whoop: Tarsem made The Fall instead, an incredible film. This time he works with a straightforward narrative: Theseus wants to kill Hyperion. Great set pieces move things along briskly, culminating in an epic battle at Mt Tartarus. Not between Theseus and Hyperion, though that is well done too. The battle between Olympians (the eponymous immortals) and Titans has to be seen. The things Zeus can do with a chain got me up off my theater seat cheering like I was at the super bowl -and I hate football. Ordinarily I don't much like sweaty gladiator cheesecake pummeling this genre offers in most cases. This is something on a higher order, worth checking out on the biggest screen turned up to eleven... times three hundred!

B004USRKR4|5.0|I am incredibly selective when it comes to modern music. A band or musician has to at least offer something substantial lyrically before I can approach their music.<br /><br />I would rank Alex Turner up there with Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams, Ray LaMontagne if not such greats as Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Neil Young.<br /><br />I know this is a slim offering of music and aside from the brief 'Stuck on the Puzzle Intro', I'm really giving five stars to five equally excellent songs. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that there are numerous albums out there where you might have twelve or thirteen tracks and only four of them are truly worth returning to. And in the case of soundtracks, most of the time you're stuck with the pleasant but prosaic ambient music they use to highlight certain scenes in the movie.<br /><br />What makes the Submarine soundtrack so excellent is that you have the creme-de-la-creme. These are the songs you remember from the film but they stand alone in their own significant way. Alex Turner is truly solo here in that the songs are spare, moody and gloriously poetic, the atmosphere more acoustic than layered. They reflect the feel of the film, the adolescent wonder and melancholy but you don't necessarily need to see Ayoade's picture to understand the songs and this I'm sure is a result of Turner's talent, his ability to tell a story or paint a picture with words, his hazy-voice and British charm.<br /><br />\\"Hiding Tonight\\" and \\"Glass in the Park\\" share a sombre, reflective note while \\"Stuck on the Puzzle\\" and \\"It's Hard to Get Around the Wind\\" have a more lively feel. \\"Piledriver Waltz\\" is really an alternative take to the same song featured on the Monkey's latest \\"Suck It and See\\" but nonetheless, rewarding and uplifting.<br /><br />I don't hide my bias here. But again, this soundtrack features the best of the best, making the less all the more worthwhile, entertaining and excellent. Quality from start to finish.

B0043GXYBO|5.0|this book was one of the best books i have ever read. the plot was amazing, and the author kept the pages turning. when i read the back of this book for the first time, i was intrigued to read the first few pages, and before i knew it i had read the first chapter. suddenly, i wanted to stop the series i was reading at the time, which was by my absolute favorite author, and read this book. and that's saying something!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Well done. Everyone should see this documentary.  Fracking is a very dangerous and polluting process, and this video gives us that proof.
0385534639|2.0|Wish the book was!  While fantastical, the too many descriptions became tedious and flat, a paint by number picture of this \\"mysterious\\" circus.  I really wanted to like it as I don't usually read fantasy (though I love magical realism).  Simply, the plot was weak, character development thin, and suspense and intrigue unexciting.  I was hoping to feel something for the many characters when I finished it, but I just didn't (feel something, that is...I did force myself to finish the book).  Not terrible, but could've been been so much better.

B004G5VFOU|5.0|Frankly, I'm not too excited about most reissue CDs these days.  Most labels just take the original recordings, compress them excessively to maximize the apparent loudness, and slap a \\"REMASTERED!!!\\" label on the product.<br /><br />This remaster sounds OK, though it is noticeably louder than the first issue.  But the real reason I bought it (and the reason to own it) is the added live show on CD 2.  This is essentially an unreleased Traffic concert album according to the liner notes, and it's from an era where the band was not well represented by live tracks.  The track list encompasses several of my favorite Traffic compositions, including \\"Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring\\", \\"Every Mother's Son\\", \\"40,000 Headmen\\", and an excellent performance of the rarely heard \\"Glad/Freedom Rider\\".  The band was obviously having a good time, and their enthusiasm shows in the way they draw out the songs to slightly extended lengths.<br /><br />Regardless of the added studio tracks, the live show is worth the cost of the CD by itself.  This is a must-have for every true Traffic fan.
B00005LELD|5.0|While it works without vignetting for Nikon 35mm f/1.8G lens, it may be a waste vs the standard plastic hood.  Although the versatility of hooded/non-hooded mode is great, it's also a hassle to ensure the hood is physically extended (prevent flares) or retracted (prevent vignetting).    On the plus side, you can just collapse the hood to prevent vignetting, whereas the built-in plastic hood requires you to physically reverse the hood, which prevents manual AF-override.  Besides, the rubber hood (although it screws onto the lens/filter)--rather than the hood screws--allows you to adjust the length of the hood on the fly.
B005HWAOCA|4.0|First of all, it's great to see Cream finally captured live while the band is still capable of delivering a praiseworthy performance.  The other reviews are right on - the only real Cream concert we have other than this, is the \\"Farewell\\" show which is a bit choppy and doesn't do credit to the blistering performance they did.  This live engagement does feature some memorable versions of Cream's best work.<br /><br />The audio is fine, and seems to be well balanced on every song.  You can clearly pick out each instrument, and follow along if you want to hear all the details.<br /><br />The video, however...  I'm not sure if they just couldn't hire enough cameramen for the show, or if the ones they obtained were unfamiliar with what they were supposed to be doing, but there are some world-class gaffes in the shooting and editing of the video.  Cameramen are constantly wobbling while trying to hold a shot, the focus is often miles off (and then jerkily corrected), the operators sometimes seem to be confused about what they're supposed to be framing... and more than once the camera switches subjects in mid-phrase, taking seconds to find and focus the next shot.  Worse, the editor didn't seem to be paying attention, and fails to cut away to a static or second camera input when a cameraman goofs.  I wonder if they tried to capture the concert with just two cameras (plus the static one) and this was due to the operators running crazily around trying to capture everything...  It's a little disconcerting, but fortunately doesn't ruin the show.  It does look a bit like an amateur recording except for the excellent HD video quality.
1419702238|5.0|Summary  This book is based on the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. It shows that if you want presents you have to be good but you can't be good for that long. So the characters must find ways to be more good for the things that they have done that is bad.   Strengths  * Told from the view of the middle child so the little child gets all the attention while the oldest child get the rest of the attention so the middle child hardly get any attention at all. (ex. Thinks that he isn't part of the family)  * The author picked a grade that many of the readers are either going into, are in, or have been.  * The author encourages kids to find ways to make money. (ex. If he wants money he needs to shovel peoples driveway)  Weakness   * Book is to short compared to the other books in the series (only 217 pages)  * The main characters don't have much common sense  * The author made the kid kind of scared/wimpy (ex. They are scared of a 3rd grader.)  * The main character (Greg) is kind of dumb he should be smarter (ex. He tried to shovel a driveway by using a lawn mower)  Authors Purpose   &  Evaluation of Effectiveness  The author's purpose is to entertain.  The book is entertaining and it will make you laugh.  The author is pretty effective at doing this. Sometimes you will need to go to the bathroom from just reading the book.  But the author really needed to add some more funny jokes because it isn't what the characters say that is funny, but the things that the characters do that are funny.  Recommendation  I would highly recommend this book to a friend (I already have). It is very funny and a good book that many people would like. I say this because the book is based on the time around Christmas and a lot of people like Christmassy books. The main characters are kind of dumb so sometimes the things that they do will make you laugh so hard that you almost pee your pants.

B001EN71CW|5.0|When I saw the special for Firefly on Bluray for $20 for only one day I told every Browncoat I knew, right after ordering my own, of course. I'd searched for it before and it was impossible to find the complete series for under $80. But, if you have the extra dough lying around, or are up for saving, its abso-freaking-lutely worth it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Thanks Warner Brothers for putting together execellent mastering of video and sound of the Harry Potter series and having it so when you load the Blu-ray into your player, it actually goes straight to playing the movie.  No trailers or adds on the Blu-ray when loading, no BD-Live loading tralers for you, no having to hit menu or skip or fast forward, it just plays the movie.  Also when stopping, at least with our Samsung player, it remembers where it left off and starts playing (just like DVDs), again, no hassles, not setting bookmarks, etc., it remembers where it left off and starts playing.  We also have a 5.1 surround system and the sound quality and mixing is excellent.  So we are very happy with our purchase and also enjoying watching the movies again at home and at a good price for the set from Amazon.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I gave this five stars so you can see this first!   I plugged this in and unplugged my headphones from my computer. Then I plugged my headphones into this. The right ear phone is now dead silent, yet in the PC it was perfect stereo. I now agree with most of the other reviewers of these types of headphone amps, less than 50 bucks means less than working properly. Trust me.. you'll hear good sound in one ear and the other will be lacking majorly. I can only imagine people watching TV with their heads tilted because of this.  DO NOT BUY!!

It is overpriced(hence only four stars), but it's well built, seems to offer some protection for your fire, and pretty lookin' too. Oh yeah, the chemical smell was never there enough after the first week or so for me to smell it without shoving my nose in the thing, and is even less present after the machine wash.
1423140591|5.0|This book was wonderful. It had a great plot, characterization, and setting. I loved it. Riordan is an extraordinary author.<br /><br />It takes place in modern times and is about three demigods (sons and daughters of Greek and Roman gods), Percy (son of Poseidon), Hazel (daughter of Pluto), and Frank (son of Mars. Percy doesn't remember anything other than his girlfriend Annabeth, but he makes it to the New Rome, which is in San Francisco. Here he meets Hazel and Frank. Hazel was brought back to life by her half-brother Nico, and Frank whose life depends on a piece of wood. They are sent on a quest to free Thanatos, god of death, in Alaska from the giant. They leave and along their way they meet Iris (the rainbow goddess), Phineas (from Roman mythology), Ella the harpy, Amazons, and griffins. On their way Leo had a talk with his grandmother, and she tells him that he can transform into any animal. They make it to Alaska and have to fight the giant made of metal, Alcyoneus, to free Thanatos. To save Thanatos, Frank saws through the binds with the piece of wood, almost dying. Percy and Piper are fighting Alcyoneus. Then once he freed Thanatos, Frank turned into several different animals, and the trio defeat Alcyoneus. Then they make it back to New Rome where they are fighting an army of Cyclopes, centaurs, and more giants. The Romans finally defeat them. At the end a ship with Percy's girlfriend, Annabeth, and several other demigods approaches New Rome.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next book in the series.

B001HN690O|5.0|I thought this was a very good sequel to Kung Fu Panda. They are such lovable characters and ones i think children can admire. While i some of the story line is more serious than some expect it is no different than beloved animated films that have come before it like Bambi, Dumbo, Cinderella, Snow white etc. Children and adults alike with love this film and i hope there will be a Kung Fu Panda 3 one day too. I joyfully reccomend this movie.

1612130283|4.0|Unlike some readers, there were a few times when I put this book down with zero intention of picking it back up again. I'm no prude. But the darker sex scenes and Christian's Red Room really threw me for a loop at times. And as the mother of two young children, I felt my stomach clench as bits and pieces of Christian's abusive formative years were revealed. I was/am also unsure of the message behind this book...is the BDSM lifestyle the result of some awful things that happened to Christian as a child (and hence abnormal) or is it, as he states later in the novel, the thing that saved him from going down the same path as his birth-mother (and hence just another way to have sex and explore human relationships)? Or perhaps there is no \\"message\\" other than the ones you have to decide on and take away for yourself as you read Fifty Shades of Grey.<br /><br />What kept me reading this book, aside from the wonderful chemistry between the characters and the constant (and unexpected) humor, was the utter believability of Ana. She was splendidly complex and human from start to finish. Many heroines are often far too decisive, well-spoken, strong for my taste simply because that's not how real people behave. Ana may not have always made choices I was comfortable with but I forgave her because of her obvious youth, inexperience, and need for exploration and life experiences...like a real 21-year old.<br /><br />Christian is indeed an incredibly complicated man. Unlike other readers, I wasn't always pleased with him. In fact I found him downright annoying at times -- too overbearing, too controlling, too MUCH. It was also hard for me not to view him in the light of someone taking advantage of an inexperienced young woman. But as the story continued to unfold, I developed a soft spot for the guy based on all he'd obviously been through. He is incredibly sexy, mouth-wateringly so, and I can easily see why Ana keeps going back. However throughout the novel, I kept asking myself what Ana would do if she were 10 years older..would she have even bothered with all of this? From the POV of an older gal (me), poor Christian is damaged goods and it wasn't until Ana walked out at the end that I felt I could fully relate to her as a character. Again, I like Christian...but I am not comfortable with him, nor is he typical hero material for me.<br /><br />As for the secondary characters...well, this book is definitely main character driven so not a huge amount of time is spent fleshing out the secondary folks. I agree with some other reviewers who found Jose to be rather annoying (seriously, what straight Hispanic-American male runs around saying \\"dios mio!\\" all the time? He was like a grandmother from a Mexican telenovelas) and two-dimensional. The fact is, as with ALL romances, you probably aren't reading this book for the supporting cast.<br /><br />Having said all of the above...I still could not stop reading this book. And I have just purchased the second book in the series. My take...unless you have some serious issues with overt sex scenes that often involve light to medium S&M/dominant and submissive behavior, this is a book worth reading. It probably won't make you feel very comfortable but then some of the very best novels out there are the ones that involve us emotionally and not just in a pleasant, warm-fuzzy way. I can recall having a similar response to a few scenes in Outlander but darned if that wasn't the best romance series I've ever read, period.<br /><br />PS I'd like to highly recommend that the author get an American copyeditor to rev her content to better ensure the Britishisms are kept to a minimum. I knew within the first chapter that the author was either Canadian or British due to some of the terminology and wording. It's not a huge deal but I found it distracting at times. Then again, I'm an ebook copyeditor so perhaps I'm just more aware of these things? ; )at Ana would do if she were 10 years older..would she have even bothered with all of this?

I got a great deal on these Bluray's and I am so happy to have them in my collection. This series is a must for anyone who enjoys Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, or just a good ole story about adventure and friendship. This series is one of the best ever and it's a shame there are so few episodes. But I think that's what makes them even better, you really appreciate the ones you have even more! Thanks amazon for getting these to me.
0547258305|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I loved it because it was all there; action, adventure, and a little romance mixed in. Graceling is a wonderful book...for girls I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who was a guy. It was also good because there wasn't a lot of betrayals in her inner circle of friends which was nice for a change. This book had a very good ending that I totally did not expect at all. Graceling was amazing but a little grown up so I wouldn't really give it to anyone under 12 just because of the romance part of graceling. This book is fantastic and would hand it over to anyone of my friends.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|Now among my favorites of all time, in part because it escaped the notice of so many movie goers.   Polanski creates an effective atmosphere of tension, intrigue, and a whiff of humor as Ewan McGregor tries to rewrite the personal memoir of a former UK Prime Minister, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is caught up in war crimes controversy. The untimely death of the original memoir author becomes more and more the object of McGregor's thinking as the movie unfolds.   The choice of location in New England was very good, as stormy waters and relatively lonely shoreline illustrate what the characters are feeling inside, a sense of remoteness and unsettledness with each other in the midst of turmoil. My favorite scene is where Brosnan is pacing his office while thinking through his legal entanglements, while behind him a full length window shows wind blowing violently over sea grass, and a determined yard worker keeps trying to sweep up swirling debris on a wooden deck. You get the sense Brosnan is fighting against forces that are well beyond his control, and it helps McGregor gain insight into the nature of the man he is writing about and the challenges he faces.   The final scene is perhaps a bit formulaic, revealing the personal costs suffered by McGregor as he uncovers the truth about Brosnan's character and the fate of the first ghost writer McGregor has replaced.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Survival mode is a killer feature of PvZ transforming it from a game that lasts 2 hours to one that can be played pretty much endlessly.  Last stand is one style of play in a mode extras that lets you set up a full slate of plants at the beginning instead of building it over time, and is a great mode to earn gold on.  The zen garden let's you collect, water, feed and sell all the plants in the game.  All these modes contribute heavily to the general addictive-ness of the game, and once they're all gone, some of the magic is too.    I imagine the survival mode was left out over performance concerns.  You know morons would leave 1 star reviews because their 2 year old phone couldn't hack that many zombies on screen at once, so none of us get to enjoy it.  Harder to imagine why popcap left out the zen garden or so many bonus modes like last stand.  If it's a matter of money, I'd happily buy an expansion, but without the content even being available, I've got to dock some stars from the score.  The full PVZ experience is 5 stars.  This one is 3.5 stars.  Worth the cash, but only just, and a pretty big letdown for fans.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Wanted to use this for basic data entry in a spreadsheet.  Why on earth the keyboard defaults to alpha instead of numeric in a spreadsheet is a mystery to me.  The UI for editing and moving from cell to cell is highly dysfunctional.

1597801577|3.0|The Windup Girl was a unique story with many twists and turns.  Paolo Baciqalupi painted a realistic picture of a future where many of society's current fears have come to life and the characters have to deal with the consequences. The Windup Girl is an interwoven network of stories to give many perspectives and insights into Paolo's story. It is a science fiction novel because the setting is in the future and because one of the main characters is a windup girl who was made by scientists.  From recently reading many short science fiction stories that spanned back to the pre-1900s, I feel I am able to analyze The Windup Girl from a broad science fiction perspective. A current science fiction trend that is visible in The Windup Girl is how humans are realizing that we are the root of our own problems and not some external force.  This is unique to our time period because from 1940s to the 1960s, science fiction stories had a theme of controlling the uncontrollable. We have changed throughout time and have come to an understanding that we can surmount obstacles that nature gives us, but the creation of new human-made obstacles is scary and new.    Chaos is created by humans and seemed to be a new fear that was addressed in Windup Girl. Humans have changed throughout time and have gained control of a lot of things in our world compared to the pre-1900s. We have come so far and become so efficient that a fear of going backwards and losing the organization seems to be a new theme in science fiction. Paolo wrote his story in a way that built up to the inevitable chaos. The characters feared the chaos, contributed to it, and felt the full effects of it when it happened. As a reader, was interesting to witness the changes within the characters.  The last theme I noticed from Windup Girl and other current science fiction is how there is less distinction between good and evil. The main characters seem to be more representative of normal humans with less heroism. It's a more realistic and honest approach that acknowledges how all humans are capable of evil and greatness, but rarely are people one or the other; they tend to be a mix of both. New science fiction seems to have bizarre or dangerous circumstances happen to average people who are forced to deal with them. It makes the stories easier to relate to. To me, the Windup Girl had at least two characters who I was debating almost all of the way through the book if they were good or bad.   The characters weren't very likable and seemed to be on a different level than humans today. For example, the circumstances had made people tougher and kindness was rare. Kindness seemed to literally be linked to weakness in many character connections. Kind actions were done with internal psychological debate for the characters. Basic human survival instincts had come to the forefront and had regressed to historical stages of competing and searching for food and security. Overall, Paolo did a good job creating characters who fit the dynamic of his story.  Historically, science fiction had more elements of super natural or new world experiences compared to the current and likely the future of science fiction. The future of science fiction probably will include more psychological elements and stunning new perspectives at things in our world that already exist. Compared to the past, people are more logical and have been exposed to more experiences and visuals and therefore, science fiction has a whole new audience to please. However, it also seems that the science fiction genre is broadening and there will be more subtypes of science fiction than historically.   Windup Girl made me appreciate the free speech that exists today. According to Paolo's futuristic story, free speech may become threatened and dangerous because of a spread of power to multiple organizations that have many followers. There were some major stigmas that were dangerous to talk about or be connected to. Paolo did a good job giving the impression of complicated connections and fears between people. At the same time, his approach made parts of the story and characters confusing and hard to catch onto all of the links between characters and past events.   The world created in this book is dangerous, unclean, and not friendly. The story seemed kind of dark and without hope. The characters weren't evil, but the world humans had created seemed to have taken on a presence of its own that seemed dark and dangerous. It didn't seem like any of the leaders of the different organizations seemed to have more power than the rest. It seemed like society was hard to manipulate because of the complexity of it. Some individuals had more power and confidence, but they still faced the pain and sorrow that the rest of society faced.  I liked how the wind-up girl, Emiko, had very human thoughts and was very aware of how she was made. She seemed to be trapped in a body that could kill her because if she got too hot and could get her killed by others if her jerky movements gave her away in front of the wrong person. Her feelings of being trapped is probably similar to how many people feel today who have to face a disease, obesity, paralysis, or missing limbs. The windup girl fit the role of the \\"underdog\\" that everyone was hoping would escape her prosecution. Emiko was my favorite character and Paolo did a good job keeping her story line interesting  Overall, I enjoyed reading Windup Girl. However, I felt the beginning was boring and didn't catch my attention. I didn't like how Paolo used names he made up for different objects or historical happenings and didn't explain them to the reader. Reading this book felt more like work than the average book I would pick for myself. It is very thought provoking, interesting, and at some points brought out strong emotions. I would recommend it to others who can handle a slow beginning and are interested in reading a book with a lot of depth and creative ideas about the future
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|It's hard to say anything negative about this book.  It's not supposed to be 'good', right?  So here are some things to consider:  It is not eloquently written by a professional.  Jaycee wrote this and Jaycee has minimal formal education.  It is written in a very honest, sometimes juvenile, very raw way.  And it's not for the weak at heart.  It is very repetitive -- BECAUSE SO WAS HER LIFE!!!  It's a book about what she did every single day which consisted, on good days, of very mundane, boring rituals and tasks.  On bad days... well we all know the story.    The TV special was probably a more well put together and fluid account of Jaycee's life up to this point.    From here on out, I hope that Jaycee can live a normal life enjoying the ups and downs that each of us do.  I hope by telling her story she has helped others and herself.  And while I'm not sorry I spent the money on the book, I am a little sorry that I read it.
0307891372|3.0|This guide would have been Damn handy when I first got the game on its release date. However, it took forever to arrive and by now most all the information contained in the book is available online with a simple Google search. You might wanna save your money.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|i bought this CD for my sister as a birthday present because she really likes Adele and as soon as she opened it she screamed with excitement because that was the one thing she wanted. she went and got her stereo and played it and there was no problems with it at all, no scratches or skips. So overall this is a great thing to buy for someone that is into all the new music like me too:)
B005ZUR724|5.0|Amazing game. I love WoW, and wanted it on a smaller platform, like the 360. This isn't  WoW, but it is close and exactly what I wanted. It plays flawlessly on my Kindle Fire, and is simply beautiful. I work and go to school, so my gaming time is precious. I stopped playing Saints Row the Third to play this game.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|Fun app, but needs more variety in borders. Also will not export. Nothing on my SD card, won't attach to wallpaper and even though it showes it attached to my email, no attachment comes through. Please fix
B004FOA84A|5.0|Everything about this game is fun, adventurous and plain exciting. My only gripe is that it is entirely too short...seriously. Extend it.
0811876373|5.0|I bought this book after finding Bakerella on the web, and fell in LOVE with it! Her step by step instructions are great, and the photos and project ideas are adorable! The only problem is living in a small town, sometimes it's hard to find some of the candies, but we make due. Some of my creations do not turn out nearly as cute, but I'm trying, and each time I get a little bit better. I've made them for party favors, gifts at Christmas for my office friends, and even the bride and groom set for a wedding shower. They are always a big hit, and I'm always asked how they make them. Don't be fooled, these are SO MUCH BETTER than the new cake pop baking pan available on the market. Those give you dry cake balls, with very little flavor. THESE cake balls are more like a truffle, and taste a thousand times better! You won't be sorry if you buy this book... you'll find you need a whole new shelf for candy embellishments in your pantry, and you'll be stocking up when cake mixes and frostings go on sale... and the candy wafers!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|wonderful, funny and charming. What's not to like?  you like ALL the characters which I think is the most desirable feature of any series
1451627289|3.0|Very entertaining but WAY too long-over 800 pages-the whole first third has almost nothin g to do with Kennedy anyway but takes place in New England-why not start out in Texas in 1963? Still mostly fun to read and moves fast-a great Summer Book. (save it till then)
B0063GORYU|4.0|easy to use, a good game to play when you have time to kill. a guilty pleasure. good fun to take everywhere.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|At first, before I started watching this show... I thought, this is going to be another silly zombie series. But after watching Season 1 and 2 I am now hooked. Thank you!!!
B005KN5A8E|5.0|I now own my first new Riot album on vinyl in 21 years and could not be happier. The album packaging is top notch with a Gatefold and sleeves with all the lyrics and the vinyl is a cool blue color but the best thing is the music! The album opens with the song 'riot' which is a great opener and then only gets better with the following 'Still your Man' which is sort of a sequel to Thundersteels 'Johnnys Back' and sounds so good it almost brings tears to your eyes. 'Wings are for Angels' is another great song with an excellent guitar solo by Mark Reale who is the only original member still in Riot and it is so good to see him keeping Riot at such a high level and it is also great to hear Tony Moore back singing as good as ever.
B001ER4CTI|4.0|This is the best dvd release for 300<br />It has everything a 300 fan could ever want<br />A very cool box, poster cards, many special features<br />And the video and audio quality of the film is awesome.<br />If you are a fan of this film and you do not own it on dvd then buy this edition.<br />It's the best 300 DVD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this. The only con is the ads that pop up periodically. otherwise this is the best free solitaire that I have tried.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I love this movie since i was a kid, and it is still one of my favourites.<br />This DVD is Amazing.<br />It has both the theatrical and the expanded editions of the film<br />It also has a documentary on how Richard Donner and the cast made this film.<br />If you are a superman fan and you dont own a dvd copy of this original classic then by this DVD.
030788743X|5.0|This is one of those rare books that comes along that I couldn't stop reading but then at the same time, I didn't want it to end. It's a fast and fun read, full of page-turning excitement.<br /><br />What's really intriguing about this book is that it's set in the near future - 2044. And while some of the descriptions/reviews I've read of the book make things sound pretty grim and bleak (almost post-apocalyptic) that's not really what the book is about. The protagonist, Wade, is clever and interesting and the setting is mostly in a virtual reality type of world.<br /><br />It's a story about adventure, love, hope, and nostalgia. And if you were a child of the 80's like I was (and in particular, a geeky child of the 80's) you will love this book. However, I don't necessarily feel that you have to be a geeky child of the 80's to enjoy the book. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun way to relax and festered.  great graphics,smooth play and skill level required is wee thought out.  I wound recommend this game for all.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Looks great on my white 4S. Good protection, good grip. Doesn't take away from the beauty of the phone itself.
B004UID2LC|5.0|For all the kids that give this app a bad review, the only reason yall gave it a bad review is because yall dont know  to use it correctly. If you want to download a song, just click the search button at the bottom of the screen, then type the name of the song/video and then put &quot;Go&quot;. Then put download as mp3, easy as that!
B005K2Z2O2|3.0|I bought this cover for my husband. It is light weight & nice looking. The problem is my husband seems to turn his Kindle on when he slides it into the case & then his battery is dead when he goes to read. It may just be something he is doing. I am in the process of ordering a Belkin cover for him as I have had no problems with mine.
B004GYY714|5.0|this app is good because it eliminates the need for a radio period! by far the best app that there is out there!
B00466HN86|5.0|The movie was inspiring, eye opening, educational, beautiful, motivational as well as entertaining.  I cannot think of a better way to spend some down time.  Actually, I was exhausted after seeing the movie because it aroused so many emotions. It is a walk in everyday life, with everyday people and challenges.  I cannot think of a better gift to give to someone you love.  My hats off to the makers of this fine movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is just right for what I wanted, a simple solitaire game to play when I want to do something mindless.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Recieved the gift very quickly. it's new and in the original packaging,I'm very excited to recieve something my son will love and have it in time for Christmas.Thanks!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Wow. Okay, first, Florence & The Machine wowed me with their debut album, which I loved with my whole being. Florence's voice is a haunting, ethereal, flowing thing that breaks and whispers into your mind, telling you things you want to hear, and sometimes, things that you don't (think of the single Heavy In Your Arms).  Well, I write stories, often about things inspired by Stephanie Meyer, Cassandra Clare, and Juliet Mariller. BUT, Florence (as well as bands like A Fine Frenzy, Ingrid Michaelson, and Tamar Kaprelian) has inspired me the most! Her lyrics (not to mention the music) are filled with raw things nobody's talked about before. It made me want to scream and dance and fling things, but it also made me thoughtful and bittersweet and think of things I've forgotten. Honestly, Florence's voice, lyrics, music, albums, and feelings are just too beautiful to describe.   And you know what I really love? When your favorite song changes from this one to that one to another one, and finally you have 5 favorites!   I HIGHLY recommend this album, and Florence's debut. Everything about it is perfectly perfect. :)  (Also, if you want bands that are similiar to Florence--but definitely not the same, because NOBODY can copy Florence--think of A Fine Frenzy's cool effects and music, Ingrid Michaelson's lyrics, and Tamar Kaprelian's spirit and joy!)
B006JPS1OM|5.0|There are only a handful of locations in the free version - just enough to get you hooked!  Interesting murder mystery storyline with decent writing.  Finding the objects is just challenging enough, and there are awards for speed.  Like someone else said, you can (and sometimes have to) leave a location and come back, which is an improvement over completely linear games.  And last, but not least, gorgeous graphics throughout.  Almost photographic in quality!  I don't think you'll find a better game in this genre than SED.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|This is a classic Arcade Fire Album. The Last song is obviously the best one. Packaging was great, and the cd holds up to its great price. good buy for Arcade Fire Fans
B000EHQTZO|5.0|If you need to read a review of this film you must have grown up on Jupiter.  Everyone on earth has seen this multiple times, because it is an absolute gem, especially considering it's age.  This is absolutely a no-brainer addition to any DVD collection.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I bought this for my Girl friend who absolutely loves this show. She always liked it but i never got into it. I got this for her as a gift and she went Ballistic!!! She was so excited and happy. She made me watch some of the episodes with her and the show isn't half bad. More of a chick show but still pretty good. Packaging was great, Arrived on time and the Details in the book are really nice. A lot of detail went into it. Its not just a bunch of dvd's in a box. its a well designed, well put together Collection. Didn't like the cardboard slots that held onto the cd's but o well, its good enough. Its a great gift.
B002BWP49C|5.0|When the books came out I immersed myself wholly. I couldn't wait to get to the next book. When I was done I was saddened because the only way to relive the moments were to start over. Still, I loved each book, each instant and above all the ending! When the movies began to appear I was over the moon! LOL! Each one has helped to relive what I only had imagined in my mind. Every one has lived up to my expectations and then some. Breaking Dawn has by far been the best one. I have watched it twice since it hit theatres and plan on going again and again. Looking forward to adding this DVD to my collection.
B005LB1MY6|5.0|This Cd was a gift for a friend. He loves Justice so this was obviously a good choice. The price is great, and the music is AMAZING. Justice is the Best, if you dont like this CD than your not a Justice fan sooooo reading this. This Cd has that more Disco sound that justice wanted to show off. Great Buy
B003U0I9U0|5.0|Always like their music. Came early and had great packaging. Songs were really clear with no skips. This a great CD!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife will survive the coming zombie apocalypse. It's built like a tank and is a good intermediate/large size. It is heavy -- maybe to heavy for some peoples taste. Comes sharp but can be made sharper. It's a keeper.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Package came earlier than expected. The packaging was super with the holiday card. I really appreciated this. I purchased this great item at Amazon where I usually buy all my internet items due to the great customer service.
0811877485|5.0|I bought these wall decals, because we decorated my son's room in The Very Hungry Caterpillar. But then we had his birthday party with the same theme, so I used them to decorate our basement. They're fantastic! Big and colorful - just like the book. They stick really well to the walls and were perfect decorations for the birthday party. I thought they were fantastic for the price, too - a great value!
1590171993|5.0|It's amazing that such a good book could be so largely unknown.  And I hate to over hype something, but for me at least, it lived up to all the praise.  But be forewarned: it is a very sad story.  (Too bad Ford Madox Ford wasn't around to read it.)  The last chapter, especially, is haunting, and I expect I shall return to it many times.
B003XDXVXO|1.0|I love JLo and I LOOOOVEEE Alex O'loughlin (you know he fine), but this movie is HORRIBLE. So, what if it's predictable? That doesn't bother it. It's the fact that the storyline is atrocious...not the main premise but little things like how they met-- why the heck is this guy so head over heels for her? It just doesn't seem natural. Speaking of unnatural....THE ACTING!!! OMG...Alex, you are so much better in Hawaii Five-O. It;s like all of them read the script the day before shooting. Way to kill my ladyboner, CBS.
B004LV2868|5.0|I didn´t know A-ha was so great live. It seems like going back 20 years in time. Really great purchase.
B00002DE2L|2.0|This piece is of course so overplayed and over-recorded, but if, like me, you still really like it, that makes us hypercritical of all the versions. This one seems to follow the tradition of Gil Shahan's among others, using modern instruments and a novel approach to flash the piece up. But where Shahan's was revelatory and fresh, this is just too heavy-handed, the emphasis and dynamics overdone, the rubato expecially seems forced and overly romantic, nothing seems natural. I do like the break-neck speed in some movements. But it doesn't sound intimate enough.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is awesome! I use it all the time! I am a list maker and love checking things off! It's also a great notepad for when you just want to jot something down! :-)

B001EN71CW|5.0|I love western style stories set in space. They just latch on to me. Cowboy Bebop is my favorite anime. The American Astronaut is one of my favorite movies. And this, the amazing Firefly, has got to be my most cherished BluRay. It's short lifespan is like a knife to my heart. I loved every second of every episode. Even the feature length, Serenity. I know this show is an acquired taste for some, but it had me hooked right out of the gate.

1439156816|5.0|Having to read this book for a class in college, I was skeptical at first since I have never read a Stephen King book before. I thought that it would be hard for me to understand since everyone has read one or more of his books. It turns out that this book was very well-written, despite my lack of knowledge. King has a very comfortable and easy reading style which makes it easier to understand. His background gave him a sense of character which makes him better than a basic teacher. He didn't use to many facts instead he used basic fact which helped a lot in my writing. We used this book throughout our college writing class as a set of guidelines for our class.   Thanks King,   Cadie  Matt   Angel
B005DOL0R0|5.0|An essential piece with your Kindle.  The zip never gets stuck and the whole thing does not add much to the slimness of the Kindle.
0440245915|4.0|There are a number of Grisham's early novels that I never got around to reading. A Time to Kill is one of them.  I read the Pelican Brief when it came out, didn't think much of it, and then I never read another Grisham novel for years.  Eventually I picked one up, enjoyed it well enough and since then have proceeded to chip away at the catalogue.<br /><br />A Time to Kill is one of Grisham's better novels.  It's a little heavy-handed (the white child rapists are completely unredeemable and the black father vigilante is a dedicated family man, creating a very clear division between good and evil).  Personally I think the novel would have been more interesting if Grisham had dealt in shades of gray, but that's a minor quibble.<br /><br />It is surprising that Grisham, as a new author, was able to get such a thick tome published as a first novel.  I'm not sure it needed its full page count, but for the most part the novel moves along briskly and builds suspense effectively (for a legal thriller).  Grisham provides good insight into the politics of small town lawyering and, while heavy handed at times, he does a commendable job of exploring the deep seated issue of racial discrimination in the deep south.<br /><br />The ending is not going to be a big surprise to anyone, but even though its predictable, its still reasonably satisfying.  This as one of Grisham's best three or four novels and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys legal thrillers.  (Of course anyone who is a fan of legal thrillers will have read this novel twenty some years ago)

B002VQ7PVS|5.0|A WWII kind of thriller always have been my cup of tea. This one however, took me further into the myths of broad-open passive kind of espionage. The intricate weave of past and present combined with exceptional literary ability made this book my companion for the last week. Well done
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|I thought that this movie was pretty decent for the most part, but there wasn't as much comedy as I might have expected and the story doesn't completely wrap up at the end.
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|I don't know why this bloody series is so popular. I tried to get through it, and I found myself skipping through huge chunks. And frankly, this Steig Larrson, seems to love the word: rape. Weird. Totally overated.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|it was all good but the only problem i had was that it did not have the dvd like it said it would come with

B001HN6918|5.0|bravo to the sequel. The most successful character , surprisingly , is lord shen. Lord shen masters this film! Gary oldman is beyond outstanding. I wished lord shen  could have given more opportunity to fully express its character. Baby panda is as cute as my own son. I cried twice when I saw the hungry baby panda rolled out of goose' basket and the mother panda tried to calm the baby panda in the basket. Father goose' s deepest love to his adopted son touched me deeply.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Great renditions! I love guitar/vocal duets and this one is terrific. I love the really slow songs that leave you hanging out in space waiting for the next verse to carry you on.

B005J7K964|4.0|Normally, I'm an absolute, obsessive purist about films in general, and silent films in particular.  I was thrilled when Kino released its restored Metropolis in 2002; I was ecstatic when they released it again with more footage in 2010.  Normally, I would regard Moroder's version, with its synth score and 80s pop songs, as an absolute travesty.  But you know what?  It isn't--it's actually a very good, watchable and interesting reading of Lang's classic.  Moroder clearly knows the film well, and restored some missing footage.  The tinting came from a copy in Australia, and although Lang himself did not approve of tinting for Metropolis, at least there is some historical precedent for it (it actually does look very much like the colour scheme you find in many silent films--with a few rotoscoped twists that suprisingly add to the enjoyment).  The subtitles are a bit strange, but Moroder assures us that even that has some historical justification (he found them on a Pathe-Baby 9.5mm copy).  So what's controversial?  Well, the soundtrack, mostly.  It's not particularly bad, and compared to the public domain Internet Archive/YouTube versions floating around, which just use tape loops of early 20th-century classical music--or worse, an upbeat 1920s light jazz loop that I also heard on a TV broadcast of Chaplin's The Gold Rush!--the newly-composed score is certainly a vast improvement.  It's a little generic, and the songs aren't especially memorable on their own (the exception is Freddie Mercury's--not surprisingly, he injects some real passion into his piece, and reveals what an amazing talent he was, certainly miles above Bonnie Tyler, Chris Squier, and even Jon Anderson), but they're not grating or annoying, either.  The worst that can be said of the soundtrack is that it hasn't aged as well as the film itself, but as far as 80s synth-pop goes, Moroder could have done a lot worse (as a side note, it would have been great to hear what German group Kraftwerk would have done with this--the film seems tailor-made for them).  Moroder's version in no way replaces the Complete Metropolis, also from Kino--without question the only authentic version of the film, using the original score and intertitles.  Anyone who enjoys Moroder's version and wants to see the real film NEEDS to see the Complete version.  But the corollary is true, too: if you love the Complete Metropolis (as I do), you can sit back and enjoy this other version as well.  It was made with care, and it largely works--and, if nothing else, the colour tinting is a treat for the eye.  See it today.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|One of the reasons I prefer Mariah Carey to many of her pop counterparts is the consistent level of hard work she puts into her albums. Even if I am somewhat disappointed with an album itself, as I have been with some of her recent efforts, I know I'm listening to someone who took charge of the record from the earliest inspiration to the finished product. Merry Christmas II You is an album where the hard work is evident, and the finished product is thoroughly enjoyable.  Since its title positions the CD as a sequel to 1994's Merry Christmas, there is obvious reason to compare the two. Much has changed in the 16 years that have passed. Mariah's voice is thinner and airier, but it's a style that is significantly more relaxing and warm, which is especially suited to tracks like \\"The First Noel\\" and \\"Charlie Brown Christmas.\\" Her songwriting has become leaner and more classic, as the timelessness of \\"Christmas Time is in the Air Again\\" and \\"When Christmas Comes\\" certainly exhibits. Mariah's ability to convey the excitement and joy of the season has not changed, and she can still tear up some of the holiday's best-loved songs - respectfully, of course.  By itself, Merry Christmas II You is classy, comforting, and uplifting. The record is a testament to expert craft balanced with genuine emotion. 4 Stars.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|fabulous cd by the late great Ms Amy Winehouse.  Every cut is great!  What a loss she is to the world.  I highly recommend this one!
0307474275|1.0|I can stomach the average clich&eacute;d, boiler plate, mildly-entertaining during a boring transcontinental flight type of thriller, but reading this ridiculously over-rated, mind-numbingly awful, mercilessly indigestible, flagrantly moronic steaming pile of excreta by that idiot-savant, Dan Brown, is somewhat akin to being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic while coming down with a bad case of intestinal parasites-- it's infuriating, nauseating, and indescribably awful all at once.<br /><br />On the bright side, you now no longer have to wonder which of your many friends and acquaintances have discerning taste and strong intellectual abilities, and which are the schmucks who squeaked by with a C average while majoring in communications at their third-tier liberal arts college; if they list the Da Vinci Code as one of their favorite books, don't be holding your breath for their Nobel Prize nomination.

0060873027|3.0|Seven grad students are offered the chance of a lifetime when employment opportunities open up at Nanigen. A shocking discovery puts them all in grave danger, though, when they find themselves shrunk down to \\"micro\\" size. As they battle giant bugs and make their way across the Hawaiian wilderness, each of them draws on their own specialties to help the group survive. But can they make it back to Nanigen in one piece?<br /><br />This posthumous release from Crichton is pretty hard to overanalyze. Pure entertainment with pretty flat characters and a simplistic plot. Fun is probably the best word to describe it. It got more than a few giggles out of me, but made for an amusing afternoon's read. I'd imagine it would be a fun video-game (and has about as much depth).
B003Y5H5AQ|1.0|This set has a great Blu Ray, dvd and a horrible Ultraviolet streaming copy.  I want a real digital copy that I can download using an itunes code and not have to be connected to a wifi connection or use a 3rd party video app.    Ultraviolet is a rip off.  Avoid this and just get the regular Blu Ray copy.

1607053888|4.0|Unlike the others reviewers thus far, I was not familiar with this author or her website before examining this book.  I think those who know her projects from her website would appreciate it a lot; for me, I was slightly disappointed.  The title is appropriate: the bags are classic styles (hobo, tote, clutch, etc.), and the designs are modernized by the choice of fabric, which is mainly colorful prints.  They are very well-chosen and a good source of inspiration.  There are many photographs in the book, including several examples of each of the 19 bags in different fabrics.  There are also many photos of the step-by-step directions (which is relatively rare in books of this sort).  The author writes clearly, so even sewers who have relatively little experience should be able to follow the instructions. My own feeling is that for more advanced sewers, this book is less worthwhile than, for example, the book called _Sew the Perfect Bag_.  It has more bags and a much greater variety of styles; it would be a lasting and versatile resource. This is not to be overly critical of the book under review, but if you're not buying every book available, then it might be worth considering one with more variety.
B005ORVMCY|4.0|The new remasters sound wonderful, I like them better than any previously released recordings. A Farewell to Kings in 5.1 is a gem!  The packaging however is an unmitigated disaster!  Every single disc in my Sector 2 box set has feathered scratching on the disc playing surface. They either came out of the factory that way or the plastic sleeves are the cause. Either way, this is totally unacceptable. I ended up putting the entire set in jewel cases to avoid any further damage to the disc surface. The plastic sleeves are a joke. The playing surface of any CD should never be in contact with anything period.  5 stars for the remasters....they sound absolutely superb.  1 star for packaging only because Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars which is what it should be.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Let´s remember these are great musicians, those who has seen them perform in Las Vegas would confirm this. As a long time hard rock fan I was getting tired of listening to the genre after 25 years...but Steel Panther gave back the fun on Heavy Metal as they submitted the kind of lyrics we would love to hear in the heyday when Tipper Gore ruled censorship.  Just Like Tiger Woods is my favorite...yeah I know sometimes the lyrics sound stupid but who cares! They are amazing...if one day they decide to do a Serious album it would be epic!!  I really really really recommend this cd, go and get it!

B006GLQIVC|5.0|Yes, I had quite a few dealing moments.  Dealing with Tate, I had to scratch my head.  Dealing with his mom, I'm still scratching my head.  Dealing with her lover, I'm still scratching my head.  (Yes, yes I know he's that boy from \\"Y&R\\"). Dealing with Violet, I guess she's dead(really?)  So now her mom is dead \\"really?\\"  I'm just not confused on how this will turn out.  But, this horror story can be scary.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Though this blu ray doesn't add a lot to the Firefly experience, it does look quite beautiful. The commentaries are informative, funny, and tell you how strongly the cast and crew felt about this wonderful but ill-fated series.   The five stars is of course for the series itself, though the Blu Ray itself is a wonderful addition to my collection, the commentary is from the old DVD set. Though the upscaling is rather beautiful.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King never fails to 'think outside the box' but this time he managed to do so with a historic event. I think that makes this book irresistible to anyone who has ever suspected that the governments account of JFK's assassination didn't pass the stink test. The sci-fi twists mixed with history as well as some romance makes this book worth the read and in my opinion this is the best book King has written in years.
B005DC68NI|4.0|I just finished reading this book by David Gaughran, and felt I had to say something about it. This is my first ever book review, so I'll try my best not to make a mess out of it.<br /><br />When I first saw this book, I was like, \\"Great. Just what we need. Another book about how you can make loads of money selling your books on Amazon.\\" But having taken the time to read through the thing, I have to say I'm very glad that I did. The first thing that struck me was how well written and professional the book is. I had to keep reminding myself that this was written by an indie writer, just like myself.<br /><br />Admittedly, most of what's in here is what any serious aspiring indie publisher should know, or what is readily available elsewhere on the internet. But I love the fact that it is all neatly collected here, making for a nice addition to an indie publisher's reference library.<br /><br />I also love the fact that he included all these great testimonials by other up and coming indie writers. There's nothing like listening to how these writers struggled to get to where they are today. Very inspiring.

0375703764|1.0|I agree with most of the one star reviews, I was really looking forward to reading this book. To me, it was not only a story within a story, but also two stories that draws out to no end without any clear grasp to the plot. This was probably the most boring book I've read, and I've read plenty. I don't usually hate too many books I buy, I might kind of \\"like it\\" even if it wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't mind the page layout, though the footnotes were annoying at times, I got use to the transition between the stories, but I couldn't get over how dreadfully boring the book was and how meaningless it was to me. I felt like the author wanted to come across as a unique writer, which he did accomplish becoming a unique writer, just a terrible one, in my opinion. I was looking forward to the \\"scare\\" and the fact it was top of few horror book lists, but no...I found one part that was done well and eery, but then after that, the book never delivered. I also hate how the story within the story was about a documentary and how much the story skipped and how long the author dwells on telling you about something for pages and pages instead of being creative like most authors, and get to the point quickly in a sentence or a few paragraphs so you get their point, no he had to waste pages and pages on writing about one idea and spiral off in so many directions that once I finally reached the point of feeling that I might come to a conclusion, no...there was none, or maybe there was? I don't know,the author seems to have written that quite often, \\"Maybe it did, maybe it didn't, I don't know, I'm too freaking unique to draw a conclusion for once.\\"

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I don't normally read fantasy/sci-fy - I'm not exactly sure where this story resides - but after not finnishing several 99 cent mystery/thrillers, figured I'd give it a whirl. I note several negative reviewers wrote from the perspective of the trilogy, and it's my experience that, like movie sequels, they get weaker as they progress, so I have no plans to read books 2 or 3.  That said I found this a good read. It was well written and I particularly felt the dialogue was quite realistically presented - not stiff, not clipped or terse - and provided some sense of the thought process of the speakers as the words came forth.   As fantasys go, you must choose to put yourself into the life style and environment of the characters and I was able to do this because of the detail furnished in the narrative. I bought into the heroine, from the beginning and thought her character was well developed, as were the other important participants.  Although the action lagged, at points in the middle, the  story line sustained interest as well as curiosity as to how things would finally play out.

B004LWZW2E|4.0|It takes a lot to scare me. I've got roughly three decades of horror movie watching and fandom accrued, and few movies from the horror genre genuinely impress me - especially nowadays, where crass film studios forego any semblance of quality in favor of cranking out endless lame sequels, and complicit audiences reinforce studio behavior by continuing to shell out box-office ducats for cinematic offal. Insidious is one of the few recent horror entries to actually provide genuine scares. There are several elements I can point to which explain why next.   Firstly, this film focuses on the element of dread. So few horror movies today generate any real dread, and instead use cheap cat-jumping-suddenly-into-frame scares, overly elaborate death scenes, and/or look-how-psycho-I-am killers to mask the fact that they don't really offer anything truly scary. Examples of this in the horror genre are legion, such as any film directed by Rob Zombie (I mean seriously, is anyone really scared by dirty, profane trailer park rejects or long haired blonde kids wearing rock tees?). Even the people that made Insidious are guilty of some of this (read: the Saw films). But in the case of Insidious, the filmmakers put most of the cheap techniques aside and instead utilize excellent atmosphere, decent pacing, competent editing, and thoughtful scoring - all of which combine to really drop the psychological hammer on the viewer.   Secondly, the family being tormented in the film is sympathetic. Though the characterizations of them aren't overly deep, the important thing is that the family isn't an object of audience irritation. This is such a basic rule in making an effective horror flick, and yet it is constantly ignored by the hacks that put out most \\"horror\\" films. Most times I want to punch horror film characters for being abjectly irritating or stupid; so it's only gleeful schadenfreude on my part, and not fear, when they meet their inevitable end. This film produces real apprehension simply by generating a basic level of empathy for the family.  Finally, the film utilizes top notch camera work and shot framing. This is SUCH an important aspect in terms of inducing fear in the audience, but most horror films don't even bother (or their directors just simply don't have a decent feel for how the framing and position of their camera can completely add or subtract to the audience's level of psychological torment.) There are quite a few moments in Insidious where the director uses his knowledge of the audience's knowledge of overly used horror film camera techniques to mess with them and to manipulate their expectations - which of course works brilliantly to throw the viewer off kilter and generate real foreboding.  To wrap up, quite a few of the negative reviews I've read here are plainly misguided. Some argue points that have weight, but to say that the film needed more special effects or that it didn't have any scares just underscores the fact that many horror movie audience members clearly don't appreciate horror flicks that aren't garish or that forego theme park bells and cheap (or not so cheap) thrills. Yes, I'll grant that the first half of the movie is superior to the second, and that the film goes off the proverbial rails a bit in the second half. I'll also concede that the paranormal investigators and a couple of the story elements are a tad over the top and annoying. But to say it can't be any good because it channels Poltergeist or other films is a completely baseless argument. Horror films and indeed most other films ARE derivative; it's just the inevitable result of an industry with a century-long history. The question isn't whether a film uses ideas, plot devices or tropes that other films have used (as, at this point, it's almost impossible not to), the question is, does the new film do it in an effective way while bringing some fresh elements to the mix? Since Insidious in the end is a pretty effective little haunted house variety nail-biter, and definitely one that will several times make your best girl squeeze you tight, in this case the answer is yes. I give it three and three quarters stars and say \\"Check it out.\\"

B0009HLD0K|5.0|This movie was great. An uncle of mine recommended it and me liking all things to do with cycling I went and got it. It is a movie of coming of age in small town life, rivalries between youth, and a pride to defend.Dennis Quaid, one of my favorite \\"serious\\" actors comes out in this movie as a kid (teenager) so you get the idea of how old this is. Its is quite humorous too. It is from before my time (1987) and some jokes I did not get but my mom was cracking up at times. It is a great movie for the whole family.  I just want to point out that more than about bikes it is about the people. Biking is only a way to manifest the \\"dreamer\\" side of one of the main characters which is like a rite of passage for every teenager.  It is a good story about family and friendship bonds with some whimsical and sometimes cheesy humor that aught to make you smile if you cherish those \\"coming of age\\" movies.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I first watched Before Sunrise in 1995 when I was just 13 years old. I loved it, even if I didn't completely understand the implications of the conversations between the 23 year old college students. Before Sunrise was a movie about American Jesse and French Celine who meet on a train and enjoy each other's company so much they decide to continue their journey in Vienna for the night, before Jesse has to leave for America the next morning. It's about two people meeting, making a connection, and in one night, falling in love. I hated and loved the open ending of the two of them promising to meet each other on December 16 six months later.   Fast forward to 2004 and I'm (then) 24 years old and seeing a preview for Before Sunset. I'd forgotten about Before Sunrise, but watching that preview reminded me instantly. Much like the characters, I'd fallen in love and wanted to know more.   In Before Sunset, Jesse and Celine meet up again, this time in Paris, as Jesse is promoting his book, a novel, a memoir based off their one night together nine years before. Key questions get answered: Did they meet again December 16 all those years ago? What have their lives been like? How are they different NOW than they were when they were hopeful and young? How has the last nine years changed them, and their outlooks on life?   Set against the backdrop of Paris (Richard Linklater, Ethan, and Julie really did film there), the story is romantic and beautiful, and the viewer (I sure did) feels like they've reunited with old friends. Although Jesse and Celine are the stars of the movie, I feel that Paris was a silent cast member as well, quietly there in the background so you got a hint of her beauty. The film is shot in long sequences, long minutes of dialogue and every word and gesture feels like you're not watching a movie, but instead, as Jesse says at the beginning, \\"you're there, you're in that moment\\" and it's just so...natural. It's a heartbreakingly beautiful movie.   That said, if 'conversation' movies aren't your thing, you'll not like Before Sunset, or Before Sunrise for that matter. Which is a shame, because they're two beautiful films. If you do love Before Sunrise and haven't seen Sunset yet, I recommend re-watching Sunrise. And then after watching Sunset, re-watching them again. Because it's absolutely fascinating to see how their outlooks on life have changed over nine years, their philosophies and views are vastly different between 1995 and 2004. It's a wonderful treat.   SPOILER ALERT!!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK:  *  *  *  Ok, so for those of you who have watched the movie, I loved the ending. Yes it was open-ended, but in my opinion, with Celine's sly \\"baby you are going to miss that plane\\" and Jesse's \\"I know\\" and that little laugh, I think he stayed, and he decided he wasn't going to go back to his \\"pretense of a marriage.\\"   Which is why I'm terrified and elated at once that the Trio are getting back together to write, direct, produce, and film a new \\"Before\\" film.... I don't want to find out they didn't stay together and at the same time I really want to revisit these characters! How can it get better than Sunset? :(

B001EN71CW|4.0|The series is indoubtedly one of the best Sci-Fi series of this past decade.  Fox canceled it for no clear reason, because it has become kind of a cult Sci-fi tv show for all geeks (and brown-coats) out there, and it is well deserved.<br /><br />But, besides the series, the product its quite good.  The case is standar Blueray, and it has only 3 BD Disks, unlike the DVD Version with 5 disks (if I can recall, I also have the DVD version of this series).  The Image quality is not that much BD Quality, I don't know exactly why, but it is nevertheless a little better than DVD quality, and that is good enough for us fans of the tv show.<br /><br />If you like the series and have the DVDs, maybe you can skip this Blueray version, unless your DVD package takes too much space and you need to reclaim some of that space at home.  If you don't have the DVDs, and are fan of the series (or fan of Starwars, Star trek, Farscape or anything in between) you should rather buy this Blueray version.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

B000YABYLA|1.0|An outrageously unfunny comedy that tries way too hard to think outside the box.  I literally did not crack a smile the entire movie.  Yes, a few lines were perhaps amusing, but definitely not laugh-out-loud funny, and simply not enough of them to make this a good comedy in my book.    I found it to be a really bad movie all around: the story is not plausible, the characters are not believable, the dialogue was horrific, and I did not much care for the soundtrack.  Now, the acting was not bad (I actually walked away from this movie respecting Jennifer Gardner as an actress for the first time), but that is not enough to save the movie.  I have to agree  whole-heartedly with all the reviewers who stressed that the movie has horrible, HORRIBLE dialogue.  It seems they tried so hard to make every line provocative and edgy, they ended up sucking every ounce of life and credibility out of them, for the sake of quirkiness.    The plot of the movie felt half-baked in its unexplained contradictions:  1.  Like many other reviewers said, Juno sounds like she's 30.  How does a girl that mature, who knew so much about abortion clinics, who did not have any religious imperatives not to use contraception, who did NOT have sex in the throws of the passion, etc. not think to use a condom, to begin with?  I just don't buy it.  And this undermines the entire premise.    2.  Juno discusses peeing on a stick with a convenience store clerk (in a small town!), with a somewhat hostile clerk at that, in the presence of others, as well, and then, at some point, she complains that she is the target of looks and gossip at school?  This does not seem to compute.  Either she's such a free spirit, or so out of touch with reality, that she does not care, in which case, she should not care about the rumors, either (and I understand that teens can be cruel and could get even to such an aloof person, but we see no real nastiness going on in the movie).  And if she does care about her reputation at school, has she considered not waving the stick in people's faces?  If she cares, would she really want everyone to know that she had a pregnancy scare, if it turns out to be a false alarm?    3.  There was 0 chemistry between Juno and her \\"love\\".  He had the appeal of a half-dried jellyfish in the movie.  Their relationship was not at all well penned, I felt not progression, no eye-opening moments, nothing.  Sure, not all love is at first sight, and sometimes you do realize that you're in love with someone who's been around for ages, but in that case, it'd be nice to at least get a glimpse of why this guy is great for this girl, and we get next to nothing to work with here.    4.  There WAS relatively believable chemistry between her and the adoptive father.  However, it really annoyed me that when she discovered he was going to get a divorce, she was SHOCKED, even though she was slow-dancing with him and putting her head on his chest as he was revealing it, and she came over to begin with knowing full well he'd be home and his working wife would be away.  And she can't even claim being oblivious, because her stepmother spelled it out for her earlier.    5.  In front of the abortion clinic, Juno tells her classmate of a girl, who OD-ed on her meds and lost it at the mall pool.  The classmate responds by saying \\"I heard that was you\\".  So, Juno has a major depression problem, but that is the first and last time we hear of it.  Why even mention it, if you will just wave it away later?  I could nitpick more, but these are, in my opinion, crucial points, and they all were unrealistic, unexplained, or underdeveloped.  While I actually liked the characters of her Dad and step Mom, I found their reaction utterly unrealistic.  While it could be refreshing to have an alternative to the mandatory freak-out session that usually ensues after such an announcement in other movies, no amount of leniency, open-mindednes, and hipness can vaccinate you against this game-changer.  Evenif you do not intend to disown your daughter, and are ready to back her, no matter what she decides to do, it is STILL a health risk (especially for a clinically depressed teen!), a potential detriment to education, a financial burden on everyone in the family, etc.  So, I feel like the movie went too far in trying to downplay the gravity of the situation.  Same goes for the best friend.  We hardly know why they are best friends, and I do believe that the best friend was supposed to be a cheerleader, and yet, she hangs out with an \\"outcast\\" (and don't even get me started on Hollywood repeatedly attempting to convince us that beautiful smart girls can't fit in), sticks with her through the entire pregnancy, when others, supposedly, avoid her, AND joyously and actively participates in the birthing of Juno's child!  Are there friends like that, at 16?  Perhaps, I hope so.  But it's just one perfect character too many.    I rarely feel compelled to write a movie review, because, unlike a Kindle or some other tangible object, what works and what does not is not always something verifiable and reproducible, or even \\"explainable\\".  Still, more often than not, I can recognize the merits of a movie even when I don't like it.  This movie was just so far removed from what I expected based on the hype, that I decided to add my two cents in support of those who found the movie weak and undeserving of the praise (and I found out here - an Oscar for the screen play???  really???).
B004EPZ07U|1.0|*spoilers* Every chance this movie gets it turns something that could have been profound into something that is overused and shallow. Surprisingly Ryan Renolds, though being an actor I greatly dislike, does a decent job of portraying a Hal Jordan similar to the one in Geoff John's GL comics, but unsurprisingly everything else is just a shadow of what it could have been. The Green lantern Corps is seemingly nonexistent for most of the movie, but highlights include very short, but decent appearances by Green lanterns Kilowog, and Tomar-Re. In the comics, Parallax is a giant, glowing yellow beast. In the movie he is a giant, brown fart cloud that floats around looking ridiculous. If a hero is truly only as good as his greatest enemy, what does this Parallax say about Hal Jordan? Sinestro and the Guardians debate using a yellow ring, the power of fear, against the threat(?) of Parallax, but Parallax is defeated by Hal Jordan in what turns out to be a \\"Follow me to the sun! It's nice and warm in the sun!\\" deal. In a post-credits sequence Sinestro puts the yellow ring on anyway, and is needlessly corrupted by fear. And the whole time the Green Lantern Corps is off doing whatever it is that they do when a world-devouring threat is threatening to destroy their home-planet Oa.   And don't even mention Hector Hammond.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|We had never seen the series and when Amazon offered a special on this we decided to get it. We love Nathan Fillian in the series Castle and were not disappointed in Firefly. The stories are full of humor, action and drama. If you like science fiction, try this series out. Our only disappointment was that it wasn't around longer.
0553801473|3.0|I'm a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books, but I have to say, compared to the first three books, things are starting to take an ominous turn. If I was talking about the story getting darker that would be a good thing but, sadly, I'm not. Let me explain...<br /><br />In the early books, things moved quite nicely along. Plots were plotted, intrigues were intriguing and action was thick and fast.<br /><br />As the series has progressed, however, things have taken a decidedly odd turn, which I'll label, \\"The Robert Jordan\\" effect. Now I like Jordan's books, but at a particular point his Wheel of Time series ground to a halt and endless irrelevant characters were introduced for no good reason whatsoever. This is what appears to be happening to GRRM's Ice and Fire books. Irrelevant characters? How about Asha Greyjoy? Grinding to a halt? How about this very book!<br /><br />If one summarised what happened in Dance with Dragons, it would go something like \\"Characters wander about a bit, the plot doesn't progress more than a hair's breadth and hoped for meetings and resolutions don't happen.\\"<br /><br />I wish I could be more positive about the book, but this is the first of Martin's works that I've actually started skimming paragraphs because I felt they were pointless and uninteresting. This is usually a really bad sign for me, since I like long, epic books and series. I like a lot of grist and fat to chew on in a story. But when that fat turns out to be rancid, I'll spit it out and give it a miss, thank you very much.<br /><br />There is also an increasing incidence of what I'll refer to as \\"Time dilation\\" going on. Martin will spend two hundred pages describing an unimportant trek for one of the characters. Later, another character seems to teleport from one place to another without any detail of the journey, whilst that same character elsewhere has other travels painstakingly detailed.<br /><br />The entirety of the book could be condensed down into three hundred pages or so without losing any of the substance or important details in the story.<br /><br />I've given this three stars, but that is more out of respect for the earlier works. I hope the next installment sh9ows a decline in Martin's tendency to pad things out.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|I heard mixed things about Another Earth, mostly what I heard was that it was highly over-rated. As I was still highly intruded about the film I blind bought it on Blu-ray. I went in thinking I would probably be semi-entertained for 93 minutes, however I got much more out of it than I expected.<br /><br />The style of the film is what got me. Yes it is a very independent film, yet it has something to offer which not many big Hollywood blockbuster movies have. It is a smart movie which is heavy on drama and a bit lighter on sci-fi. There are many very cool shots of Rhoda (Brit Marling), the main character walking with Earth 2 in the background. As a sci-fi fan, and an indie drama fan, I greatly enjoyed all aspects of this film. Techno music would usually not seem a great choice for a drama, however it fits in well and builds your anticipation.<br /><br />The thing that really got me was the 89 minutes of great character development and the last 4 minutes of twists in the story line. I sort of knew where the movie was going, however I cannot get the ending out of my mind. It greatly reflects back on the entire film and a viewer who watched and listened to the film will greatly enjoy and appreciate the powerful ending.<br /><br />The cast was perfect. Brit Marling was fantastic and William Mapother also did a great job, but they both really shine together. They each have their own individual depressions and darkness, however together they either share it or express it in different ways. This film was great and while Melancholia may be a little deeper with a much bigger budget, Another Earth greatly tops Melancholia in particular aspects of the film. Both are great films, however Another Earth is much more personable and I could relate more to their characters as it was greatly more down to Earth.<br /><br />The PQ & AQ of the Blu-ray are great. Most scenes are very sharp and clear. At times the audio is very hard to hear the dialog. The music and sounds are all great and very sharp, however there were times where I had to greatly increase the volume to hear what they were saying. For the most part though, the Blu-ray is perfect.where I had to greatly increase the volume to hear what they were saying. For the most part though, the Blu-ray is perfect.

1451627289|4.0|On inauguration day 1961, it had snowed where I grew up in upstate New York.  We shoveled.  After, we planted ourselves in front of the TV to watch John F. Kennedy sworn in as president.  In April, I stared at the headline on the newspapers I delivered, shocked by the announcement that the Russians had put the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin.  We took the Cold War seriously.  November 1963 rolled around.  During my high school typing class (one course that has served me well all these years), the PA sparked on; the principal informed us that President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas and dismissed school for the day.  Walter Cronkite and the aftermath mesmerized us the entire weekend, which accounted for us finding ourselves in front of the TV as the Dallas police moved Lee Harvey Oswald through the basement of the station, when in a blurred instant Jack Rudy shot him.  All this with the decade only a third gone, and much yet to come.<br /><br />For many of us, JFK's assassination is more than words on the page of a history book.  They are woven into the fabric of our lives; they are the past that lives in us.  When we read Stephen King's fine, often moving, new novel, when through his eyes we revisit the past, we relive an important part of our lives.<br /><br />King unites two stories into one:  the first, time travel and the opportunity to change and, it is hoped, improve history; the second, finding true love in another time.  The latter, surprisingly, is better than the former.<br /><br />High school teacher Jake Epping, divorced from his alcoholic wife, at the urging of the local hamburger joint owner dying of cancer, steps through a portal into the past, specifically September 9, 1958, with the mission of preventing Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating JFK.  Well, he has lots of time on his hands, five years of it.  After rescuing two people from horrible fates, which establish his credibility as a man capable of killing, Jake sets off for Texas via a circuitous route.  There he settles in the small town of Jodie.  He takes up his familiar profession of teaching, meets Sadie Dunhill, falls in love, and finally, after many mishaps and roadblocks thrown in his path by Time, which assumes the role of a character as it is obdurate to meddling, he confronts Oswald in the Texas School Book Depository.  In the end, his good deed produces nothing like what he had hoped for.<br /><br />King has tweaked time travel nicely in 11/22/63.  He doesn't get hung up on its mechanism.  Yes, there are convolutions and many conveniences that make numerous coincidences more plausible.  But as for getting to 1958, Jake merely steps through a portal, a rip in the fabric of time, a wormhole.  In present time, regardless of how long he traipses around in the past, only two minutes pass.  This has the taste of Einstein to it, though in reverse:  it's you who ages, not your world or acquaintances.  If after returning to your time you decide to go back, everything you've done during your first visit resets to its original, or nearly so.  Finally, the wormhole is specific:  September 9, 1958, is always your and Jake's landing zone in the past.<br /><br />The stronger of the two interlocked stories is by far Jake, known in 1958 as George Amberson (the Tarkington character, because, after all, Jake teaches English and King enjoys literary allusions), falling in love with a wonderful creation, Sadie Dunhill.  On every level, their relationship is rewarding and poignant down to the end in 1963, and the end in the present, which will impart to you a pang similar to that at the close of THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.  King brings the period, the town of Jodie, Texas, and the people, to life.  Too, he pays homage to teaching and the effect good, involved, devoted teachers can have on the lives of students.  You'll find the Jodie portions beautiful in every way and alone worth the price of the book.<br /><br />As for Jake's reason for transporting to the past,his road to November 22 is long and fraught with innumerable hazards that include eliminating doubt as to Oswald as the lone gunman and vicious gangsters.  Minus the doubt, Jake could easily have found Oswald and dispatched him quickly.  The doubt, however, forces him to become involved in marginal ways with the Oswalds, living near them and surveilling Lee's moves and associations, allowing us insight into the assassin's unpleasant character.  In the end, Jake's satisfied that Oswald is operating alone, but by that time he's reached the eleventh hour a battered and bruised change agent.  It reveals nothing to say he accomplishes his mission.  It would be too much to tell you how he manages it and who helps him, except to say it adds to the tension and instills concern.  All of this intrigue would have benefited from sharper editing.<br /><br />When he returns to the present, he discovers his good intentions have wreaked havoc, for 2011 is a version of the Apocalypse.  Unfortunately, the future, or present, is no great surprise, as in most literature and film the future is generally always a huge mess.  It is a huge disappointment, too, the single biggest weakness in the book.<br /><br />Fortunately, though, King built in an out clause:  the reset button.  Jake avails himself of it and, thus, we have a second, and by far, better and poignantly satisfying conclusion, and redemption for King and the novel.e hazards that include eliminating doubt as to Oswald as the lone gunman and vicious gangsters.

B00004ZD69|4.0|This is by far GY!BE's most popular and influential album.  It culminates the style pioneered in their earlier works, with the distinctive use of recordings of street people, preachers, folk songs, and other detritus, mixed into  eclectic, extended \\"songs\\" without conventional vocals, lyrics, verses, or choruses.  GY!BE's music fits loosely into the category of progressive rock, but a key influence is the minimalism of Steve Reich.<br /><br />This is a 2-disc album with about 45 minutes of music on each disc, just barely too long to fit on one.  Each disc is divided into two tracks, but this is misleading since all four tracks are internally diverse suites, adding up to one 90-minute extended suite.<br /><br />As many have noted, it is intensely emotional music.  What meaning it may contain is not at all clear.  It is widely known that the GY!BE collective is left-leaning, some sort of anarchists, but there are no overt political statements to be found here, just ominous suggestive phrases in the \\"song\\" titles such as \\"Cancertowers on Holy Road Hi-Way,\\" \\"World Police and Friendly Fire,\\" and \\"Deathkamp Drone.\\"<br /><br />I have never been totally convinced by this eclectic early GY!BE.  In my view their masterpiece is the last album they recorded before they went on indefinite hiatus in 2003, [[ASIN:B00006RJ1I YANQUI U.X.O.]] (see my review), which is entirely instrumental with no field recordings.<br /><br />LIFT YR. SKINNY FISTS stands, though, as the album that most clearly represents the quintessence of the band in terms of its public reception, and in that sense it is indispensable.  Perhaps the best way to think of it, as with most instrumental rock/post-rock, is as cinematic music for a film in your mind.
0439023513|3.0|As the last of a trilogy, I was disappointed in the book.  Some good angles, but the inconsistencies at the end just left me feeling this was a B- effort, and B- story overall.  If you have read the first two, you'll want to read the book to see how it turns out, but don't have high expectations for resolution.  This is a 'young adult' book, so adults are mostly evil in their actions or impotent (Katniss' mother), but believability would have been nice.  After I finished, it was more apparent that the author wanted to finish at a certain point, and forced the story to support that.    In many ways, I think the first book can stand on its own as a provacative story.  The second and third books don't develop any of the characters beyond that.
B004X60QE2|5.0|I'm 56 years old, and grew up in a household that was very deeply involved in the local political scene. I worked for a campaign for the first time when I was twelve. Between then and now it certainly appears that what what passes for political discourse would have formally been considered unacceptable by either party. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been brutal and highly controversial. I other words,it's hard to avoid the sadness, nastiness and stress that has found its way into virtually every segment of society.  And then Eureka came along. For the mere cost of forty five minutes or so of suspension of disbelief, viewers can enter a world where kindness, fairness and humor prevail. This is made possible by the fine acting, writing and production values that this show has brought to the screen every week.   Like other successful ensemble shows, it is easy to imagine that the cast members truly enjoy working together, and that they have exceptionally good relationships with the shows creators and writers. During the 1st season, some spectacularly funny (and perhaps a tad inappropriate) podcasts were available to enjoy while watching the individual episodes. Not only was it enormous fun, it offered viewers real insight to the show's creation, filming it's pilot and what it was like once the program got the green light.  Collin Ferguson as Jack Carter does a wonderful job of being the straight man for almost every other character on the show. He strikes just the right chord of portraying a strong man, who isn't ashamed to be in situations where he finds himself in over his head. Eureka's producers managed a huge score in getting the brilliant Joe Morton to join the cast. I never imagined that he would stay with the show. Likewise having Salli Richardson Whitfield on the show as the beautiful but frequently conflicted Dr. Allison Blake was a first class piece of casting. Jordan Hinson has proven to be a real discovery. Although she didn't come to the show witha very long resume, she is clearly a gifted actress who I fully expect will have a career long after Eureka has left the airwaves. As Deputy Lupo, Erica Cerra is not only a feast for the eyes, but has had the opportunity to display a wide range of emotions, always with great skill. All of the cast members, regulars or visitors are uniformly superior.  Eureka is like a big bowl of your mother's best chicken soup. When the realities of the day are making you sick Eureka offers an infusion of good will, fantasy and humor, all prepared just the way you like it.

B005CYLSW8|3.0|Let's start with what I find positive about this set.<br /><br />First, the orchestra plays incredibly well.<br /><br />Second, the recorded sound is superb. If every Beethoven cycle out there were afforded such an open, clean sound as this we might be better able to evaluate interpretive differences. You could take dictation from these recordings.<br /><br />Third, the interpretations are a not atypical combination of what we might think of as traditional and modern approaches to these scores.<br /><br />On the face of it, these recordings would look to be a welcome addition to any serious or not-so-serious classical collection. Yet to my way of listening, the set has major flaws.<br /><br />To start with, I'm not won over by the fleet tempi Chailly adopts throughout this set. Not because the orchestra can't articulate the notes, but because I feel that the players are often not given the amount of time required to fully develop the tone on their instruments. This is most pronounced in Symphonies 1 & 2. It's an important aspect of orchestral playing to consider, and one that most conductors will compensate for by easing the tempo, that is, if their interpretation relies on a certain fullness of tone making their interpretive points (B&ouml;hm, Karajan & Bernstein spring to mind in this regard), especially in scoring points in establishing and underlining the forward harmonic motion. I dare say that were you to compare Chailly to Karajan, Bernstein or even most of the HIP versions that Chailly's tempi for every single movement of every single symphony in the cycle is faster than both the norm and even the faster-than-the-norm. Taking every repeat in every movement of every symphony hardly compensates for the music being played at a tempo that works against it the first time through.<br /><br />The Eroica is fast and lightweight to a fault. The off-beat stresses in the first movement register for nothing. How can they when there's NO TIME allowed for the first beat of the bar to register, let alone the off beat accents that follow? The entire symphony is dispatched at a speed that seems to undermine the fact that it was the longest symphony ever written at the time of its premiere. It was also ground breaking - one of the most complex pieces of music written in matters of rhythm, harmony and the use of the orchestra. Yet, Chailly has somehow found a way to make THE most-consequential symphony ever written seem inconsequential! This music needs TIME to sink in, to register, to SOUND, and that it cannot do at Chailly's speeds.<br /><br />The Fourth is OK in an average kind of way, though Chailly's allowing the brass to dominate the textures on each of their appearances presents the 4th as a precursor to the 5th, which to my way of thinking does not take the 4th on its own terms. The finale is just a hair too fast, and while the bassoonist is well able to handle the exposed solo lick in the movement, the later, shorter bassoon solo is buried by the strings and is almost inaudible. BTW - that exposed solo sounds as if it's from a different acoustic. I wouldn't be surprised if it was spliced in later from a different take, maybe even a take made by the bassoonist during a solo session.<br /><br />Symphonies 5 - 8 find Chailly at his best. The 8th is very lively, possibly one of the best out there. The 5th is a bit one-dimensional at Chailly's speeds. Energetic, to be sure. Triumphant? No. The 6th may well be the best recording in the set and is a viable alternative to what's already in the catalog, but even it has a breathless quality that wears thin before reaching its conclusion. The 7th? Well, it very much reminded me of Solti/Chicago in the first movement, what with the strings fairly galumphing along. The famous second movement is objective to a fault. The third movement is simply too fast to allow the off-beat stresses to register, and Chailly doesn't help by playing the off beat measures in a rushed manner that negates any feeling of the meter shifting. It's as straight as an arrow. The finale is played well enough, though again, the fast tempo makes for a bit of a one-dimensional performance. I just never felt the finale was building to its ending. Even the half-step rumblings in the low strings that drove people of Beethoven's time nuts are under-characterized here.<br /><br />The 9th leads me to echo what I said about the Eroica - I have to say that I've never heard the 9th presented as such an inconsequential piece of music as it is here. The first movement starts off well enough, but over the course of the movement it seems to become a smaller and smaller compositional conception in Chailly's hands. Oh, there's the occasional thwack from the timpani and some very strong and well-balanced brass interjections along the way, but these appear as if out of the blue. There's none of Bernstein's weight and gravitas here. No feeling of the inevitable and - more importantly - the inexorable that one gets from Furtw&auml;ngler or Karajan. In Chailly's hands, the opening movement of the 9th rather traipses along by comparison.<br /><br />The Scherzo is extremely driven and simply too fast to my ears. Chailly's interpretation of the ff/f markings in the final 3 bars ends with a subito piano on the final note of the movement. It sounds contrived to me - Chailly channeling his inner Mengelberg. Yes, yes, we all know that there's no dynamic marked on that final note (I think it's just an editor's error), but I can't for the life of me believe that Beethoven desired a weak ending to this movement. I've never heard this approach before. The overall dynamics marked are ff and f, and Chailly makes no attempt to play the second and fourth beats of those bars - ie: the beats without any dynamic indication - subito piano, so why play the very last note of the movement that way, especially when it occurs on beat one of the final bar, which is the strongest beat in the bar? To me, it's just a gesture - look what we can do! Turn on a dime and make you take notice.<br /><br />And it's a bad gesture at that. Beethoven has just spent the better part of a half-hour-plus presenting highly agitated and loud music, even taking the unprecedented step of switching the position of the Scherzo from its typical third movement position to the second movement to open the symphony with the utmost gravitas. In any other performance, the third movement makes its appearance as a total change of pace. A hymn of beauty that bridges the emotional world of the two opening movements while setting up the triumph of the choral finale. By playing that final note of the Scherzo piano, Chailly telegraphs the calm that is to come in the Andante cantabile, giving away the rabbit in the hat that Beethoven has so meticulously prepared for the listener. One imagines that were Chailly to move over to stage direction he would have Mimi die at the end of the third act of La boheme, so inept are his choices in presenting the obvious and inherent DRAMA that Beethoven has writ large.<br /><br />The third movement - which to me is the crowning achievement of this piece - is again too fast and basically a throwaway. Throughout it all the orchestra plays magnificently, but to what end?<br /><br />The finale has been bettered by so many other versions that it's simply not even in the running. No drama or mystery to the \\"quasi un recitativo\\" basses & celli at the beginning. The solo quartet is no better than average. The choir sounds like a largish group (which is fine by me) but the sopranos tend to flat every passing high note. The tenor solo is too fast by a multiple of two and sounds, well, trite. It had me longing to pull out Norrington's admittedly way-too-slow version to counter Chailly's speed, but I couldn't as I dumped it off years ago. Yes, Beethoven  marks the section \\"Allegro assai vivace\\", but he also marks it \\"Alla marcia,\\" and I can't imagine anybody marching at the tempo Chailly picks here. The ensuing fugue is a little messy but thoroughly exciting. There's some very finely balanced and strong playing from the brass throughout the movement - really burnished tone that's worth hearing for its sake alone.<br /><br />This 9th just doesn't connect with me. I'm sure many will find it exciting and dynamic. I don't. There are nice moments and interesting touches along the way, but the overall conception to me just doesn't work. That said, I'll most likely give it another listen in a few days or so, just to see if the problem lies with me and my 40 years of listening to everyone else in this piece.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing I can say about this set overall is that there are no surprises left by the time you've made your way through it. The fast tempi and the aggressive brass playing that seemed so bracing in the first couple of symphonies one hears (whichever ones they happen to be) becomes something of an expected gesture by the end of the set. I found myself hoping that Chailly would surprise me by taking a slower tempo for the opening of the Eroica, or a more dancing attitude in the 7th. But alas, it was not to be. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, and - apparently - what happens in Chailly's Beethoven 1 is also going to happen in Symphonies 2 through 9.<br /><br />The set is full of highly individualistic interpretive gestures that may or may not sit well on repeat hearings and over the ensuing years. I say that in large part because of what I perceive as being the perspective of why those gestures were made by Chailly. I'm not saying that Chailly's interpretive gestures are more willful than those of others, but I do get that he's very much an in-the-moment performer who doesn't necessarily see himself as setting down his \\"definitive\\" or \\"for the ages\\" Beethoven cycle. In the past, recording teams would advise musicians to round off their more-extreme interpretive choices when recording, the idea being that such choices don't wear well on repeated hearings. That doesn't seem to be a consideration in this set, which elevates interpretive gestures above all.<br /><br />Still, even with the above caveats, I think this set is worth a listen. Maybe it's not worth a purchase. I was all set to purchase another copy of this set as a Xmas present for a friend who is a newbie to classical music, based on having heard Syms 1, 2, 5 & 6. But by the time I got through the 9th, I had decided against it. It's just too one-dimensional to give to a newbie to Beethoven.<br /><br />I'm sure this set will find many fans and will sell pretty well (it's certainly being talked about in the classical music newsgroups), but it just isn't my cup of tea. Speed in and of itself is not a self-recommending aspect in Beethoven, and in the case of this particular set, I feel that the speed is excessive and makes almost impossible the nuanced approach to Beethoven that we have come to expect from major orchestras, conductors and record labels. Like the John Eliot Gardner set on DG Archiv, this set may ultimately rank as Beethoven for those who like their Beethoven, well, over with - and quickly.<br /><br />Three stars.ok what we can do! Turn on a dime and make you take notice.<br /><br />And it's a bad gesture at that. Beethoven has just spent the better part of a half-hour-plus presenting highly agitated and loud music, even taking the unprecedented step of switching the position of the Scherzo from its typical third movement position to the second movement to open the symphony with the utmost gravitas. In any other performance, the third movement makes its appearance as a total change of pace. A hymn of beauty that bridges the emotional world of the two opening movements while setting up the triumph of the choral finale. By playing that final note of the Scherzo piano, Chailly telegraphs the calm that is to come in the Andante cantabile, giving away the rabbit in the hat that Beethoven has so meticulously prepared for the listener. One imagines that were Chailly to move over to stage direction he would have Mimi die at the end of the third act of La boheme, so inept are his choices in presenting the obvious and inherent DRAMA that Beethoven has writ large.<br /><br />The third movement - which to me is the crowning achievement of this piece - is again too fast and basically a throwaway. Throughout it all the orchestra plays magnificently, but to what end?<br /><br />The finale has been bettered by so many other versions that it's simply not even in the running. No drama or mystery to the \\"quasi un recitativo\\" basses & celli at the beginning. The solo quartet is no better than average. The choir sounds like a largish group (which is fine by me) but the sopranos tend to flat every passing high note. The tenor solo is too fast by a multiple of two and sounds, well, trite. It had me longing to pull out Norrington's admittedly way-too-slow version to counter Chailly's speed, but I couldn't as I dumped it off years ago. Yes, Beethoven  marks the section \\"Allegro assai vivace\\", but he also marks it \\"Alla marcia,\\" and I can't imagine anybody marching at the tempo Chailly picks here. The ensuing fugue is a little messy but thoroughly exciting. There's some very finely balanced and strong playing from the brass throughout the movement - really burnished tone that's worth hearing for its sake alone.<br /><br />This 9th just doesn't connect with me. I'm sure many will find it exciting and dynamic. I don't. There are nice moments and interesting touches along the way, but the overall conception to me just doesn't work. That said, I'll most likely give it another listen in a few days or so, just to see if the problem lies with me and my 40 years of listening to everyone else in this piece.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing I can say about this set overall is that there are no surprises left by the time you've made your way through it. The fast tempi and the aggressive brass playing that seemed so bracing in the first couple of symphonies one hears (whichever ones they happen to be) becomes something of an expected gesture by the end of the set. I found myself hoping that Chailly would surprise me by taking a slower tempo for the opening of the Eroica, or a more dancing attitude in the 7th. But alas, it was not to be. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, and - apparently - what happens in Chailly's Beethoven 1 is also going to happen in Symphonies 2 through 9.<br /><br />The set is full of highly individualistic interpretive gestures that may or may not sit well on repeat hearings and over the ensuing years.

B003Y5H574|5.0|I watched the movie and realized that I needed to have it on DVD. The best part about buying this was, Amazon let me watch it for 48 hours on their instant videos option. It's a great movie, excellent quality...Haven't ventured into the ultraviolet digital copy aspect yet, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
B002U6CJCE|5.0|this is the best in series everybody does a great job in it the action is better than most of the other big buget action films that have come out in the last 10 years.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I agree this problem is on phones with Kindle preloaded.  Phones which Amazon partnered with the carrier to get the app preloaded.  I've seen that Amazon tech support is saying the problem is too many books.  I uninstalled the updates and deleted the folder and when I did a reinstall ::poof:: 25MB.  sooo is 0 books too many?  I really love the Kindle and will still probably use the preloaded version, But PLEASE Fix this app!
B0058VW36U|4.0|This app requires some thinking to be played successfully. Of course, you get as many chances as needed to move to the next level. Some basic laws of physics must be intuitively applied to be successful. Quite enjoyable and entertaining.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Such a great movie. It is really funny and light harted. We have watched it 3 times and we continue to laugh all the way through it.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I'm fairly new at using apps and I found this one very easy to navigate.  Intuitive and comprehensive.  Unbeatable for the price. What more can I say?
B005OOSPZO|5.0|This B/R transfer of this 40+ year old film is 5 star for picture and sound and when watching close ups after the opening credits finish(credits seem to effect sharpness of back ground images)faces are stunningly sharp and I'm watching this on a 150 inch screen with sharpness right off. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
3551354014|4.0|The German Harry Potter pulls a lot of my second year students into third year (high school level), because Harry is still bit-stuff around here despite the series having ended.  It's not an easy read, but we supplement with vocabulary games, puzzles, comprehension questions, a down-to-earth Quidditch match, Sorting ceremony, all sorts of fun things.  I use it second semester, where we read in the books twice a week.  I myself have four of the seven German versions and like reading them in German although--as with most translations--not everything reads as well as the original.  I have 15 copies on the top shelf of my bookshelf where they catch the eye of even my first year kids.  I think advanced Spanish may \\"borrow\\" my idea and read it in Spanish before long, lol.  It's a wonderful way to build vocabulary and certainly easier than a lot of \\"classic\\" German lit.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It is a wonderful addition to your apps. You can do docs and organized them, plus a beautiful connection to your word, excel and powerpoint files in windows. The only ni picking is that updates comes very slow and not fast enough on Amazon apps. But I feel is an issue with amazon and not the app itself. Never had a problem with the app, so works perfect for me. I have an htc sensation.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This case my daughter purchased for my kindle fire.  The stand just does not work.  So I ordered a different style. Not any better, so I  think I will give up on a stand. Very disappointed.  updated, i just realize i had it upside down.  The case is very nice.  Sorry
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i downloaded for my Fire and have played it frequently the only gripe I have is I wish it showed what pieces were taken by your opponent.  otherwise it has been an excellent choice for chess.
B004132HZS|4.0|well sherlock arrived and i was not dissapointed in the story acting or plot great just fab, but the condition of the cd was appauling,scratched,many flat spots and just ruined a great experience, right in the middle of a good bit .........nahhhhhhhhhhhhh had to skip a chapter, i will ertainly let amazon know.....new means nver been used not faulty
B0058VW36U|3.0|It's disappointing that there's still no update. It's a great game but still no update to version 1.2. Google Marketplace has had it since the end of November. Amazon sucks. Last time dealing with Amazon apps.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|The Puzzle Quest series was very popular on portable handhelds, such as the Nintendo DS.  It crossed a match-3 puzzle system with role-playing elements.  The first game had its flaws, but Puzzle Quest 2 took what was already great and improved upon the formula.  Its addition to the Amazon AppStore may be later than others already enjoying it on XBOX 360 and other storefronts, but it is a most-welcome and worthwhile offering for gamers.<br /><br />Using the Kindle Fire, this game takes a good chunk of your memory, which the product details informs you of in advance, but the absolute playability and replay value makes it a worthwhile occupant of the internal memory.  It plays on par with my XBOX 360 version, and I would dare argue looks better than its Nintendo DS counterpart.  The voice dialogue and music were brought over genuinely, as they are a nice, aesthetic complement to the presentation.  Presentation is one of this game's grandest selling points.  The production value is quite noticeable.  This is definitely not the slap-together-quickly app that puzzle fans may have suffered through from other purchases.<br /><br />While the game is simple in premise, the role-playing elements is what defines Puzzle Quest 2.  You choose from four classes.  Each are given skills that equip special attacks versus various opponent types.  Each of these opponents also possess their very own special attacks.  As the game advances, you can acquire new attacks, but your enemies will as well.  The challenge is always constant due to this.  Along the way, you will see a story unfold that stems from its role-playing half.  The game is engulfing, rewarding and, most importantly, addicting.<br /><br />You may have difficulty finding a better puzzle game on the Amazon AppStore, let alone any platform.
0684135051|4.0|This book is an amazing resource.  The simple calculations for sweaters are fabulous and take the guess work out.  That being said...well...  The prose can be really funny at times, but it also got a little tiresome to read through.  I'm all for pithy, but when it comes down to knitting directions/patterns, it can be a bit much.  Sometimes, you just want the information straight, without the little jabs and compliments turned-around into insults.  In the end, though, I'd recommend this book to anyone.

159514188X|2.0|Lets start with the good.  The dual narrative is a unique way to tell a story, we're seeing multiple perspectives unfold and this could potentially blossom into a fuller picture.  I also think the storyline is interesting -- girl kills herself and has the (mostly) negative people in her life connect the dots of why everything affects everything through thought out audio recordings.  End of good.  I could not, for the life of me, empathize with the character who had committed suicide.  She came across as whiny and petty.  High school wasn't a cake walk for most people, but the extent of this characters wrath was absurd.  I think the one downfall to the dual narrative is that it caused the characters to lack any depth.    I really wish there had been better character development.  I like the idea of the story, but the actual unraveling needs improvement.  I felt ZERO emotional attachment to ANY of the characters.  This is unusual for me.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved these books before the show ever began. Truly an engrossing read crossing the boundaries of time and lineage. I love them all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I seldom read fantasy books but this one had me hooked from the first page to the last. Very well written. I would recommend it to both teenagers and adults.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|Some of the other reviewers quite succinctly provide all the reasons why this is such a fun, thrilling movie. So I'll keep it simple: Fright Night is one of the most entertaining movies that I've watched in this genre in a very long time. I plan to watch it again so I can savor (pun intended) some of the great scenes that went by so fast. It is such a pleasure to see David Tennant in action again (my favorite Doctor Who). A remake that is very well done!
0440244412|5.0|A few months ago,I had no desire to read Ms. Moning's Fever series. I wanted more heather and castles filled with hot Highlanders and their geeky gorgeous mates. For me, there was zero interest for the wet, dark, gritty mean streets of Dublin.  The mere thought of wading through several books about how a clueless pink magnolia blossom morphs into Wonder Woman and saves the world from the Fae was not what I wanted to subject myself to. Thanks, but no thanks. However, one fine day, I stumbled on an excerpt from Dark Fever on the very last page of Cian MacKelter's book, Spell of the Highlander. I broke down and ordered all five books and the rest is history. The first four novels were mesmerizing and addictive. i thank my lucky stars that I didn't have to wait five years for answers and resolution. I would have lost my mind.     I have one word for Shadowfever: WOW!   I devoured the book in two days and began a re-read that same evening.    I loved the interaction of all the characters and the way they played off each other. Barrons and Mac? There are no words! This final installment of Mac's series delivered and then some. There were so many exciting twists,turns, and revelations that I had heart palpitations. To my satisfaction, nearly all of my questions were answered.  Can't wait for the new books in the Fae series!
B005J7K950|3.0|Let me say that I saw this when it first came out and it opened up Metropolis to me.  I enjoyed the film and the music did not distract for me.  Now having said that let me also say I have all 3 versions of Metropolis now, the older B/W scratchy version with generic music, the Moroder version and the new Fully Restored Blu-Ray version.  Which one is best?  NONE OF THEM...  They are all different experiences.<br /><br />The original DVD version is not worth the money, scratchy and poorly made.<br /><br />The Moroder version, from a technical perspective as presented here, DARK.  You will need to up your video settings to get enjoyable playback.  This was puzzling to me until I read the box and the note from Moroder inside the box.  The print here is from an archival 35mm version.  The problem?  Normally to get the best quality you would go back to the original negative of the film (which should be 70mm not 35mm), strike off a clean copy with new stock and digitize that.  Instead they took what was likely a projection print and digitized that.  Why they did not use an original source for the 1984 version suggests that it is locked up in a rights issue so they used the best copy they had, but projection prints (even ones that are \\"archived\\") age.  I wish they had used a better source.  If you have the original laserdisc version from the 1980s I would keep it or transfer it over, it is likely of better quality.<br /><br />The Moroder version, I prefer some aspects, sub-titles are much better than intertitles that are used on the Resotored version.  Yes, intertitles were used in 1920, I got that, but you are faced with 2-3 min of actors interacting waving arms wildly, to get an inter-title of \\"Josaphat, go to my home and wait\\".  No, Moroder's choice of subtitles is definetly the correct one for a modern audience.  As for the tinting, I think it adds much to the film, otherwise it has a flat perspective, watch it with the tinting on then quickly change the video settings so that it goes to B/W and you will see a great difference.  The music, yep, 1984 all over again, but some of it is quite in keeping with the spirit of the movie, the soundtrack itself (incidental music) in the machine rooms is great-much better than the lavish orchestration in the restored edition, I again put this down to a modern view of movie music.  As for the songs, some are good \\"Blood from a Sone\\" \\"Cage of Freedom\\"-both of which are as songs, are spot on for today!<br /><br />The Restored version, the new footage does add alot to the story, BUT again, story telling in the movies has changed from then until now.  If Lang were alive and still active, I bet he would tighten up the scenes a bit.  Some go on too long, but they reflect the editing attitudes of their time period.  The music, did not appeal to me, the Huppertiz (sp?) score while vast and lavish is also overdone for a modern audience.  As I mentioned above the incidential music, such as when you see the opening scenes of the gears and machines running superimposed is just wrong (to a modern audience) it reminded me of the old Newsreels from WWII you see in museums \\"....Modern industry girds up for increase war production....\\" it fits an industrial newsreel but not a movie.  The Moroder soundtrack is better here.  I also miss the tinting.<br /><br />So which version is best, hard to say.  I had the pleasure today of running both on my 22 inch monitor this morning side by side, more or less doing a direct comparison.  It is clear that the Restored version is much clearer and has more details that add to the movie experience, but the Moroder version, with a tighter story, the use of sub-titles, and tinting does have value and if one wants to have a full experience one should invest in both.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would also want to encourage people to consider buying the British Film Institue Film Classics monograph on Metropolis by Thomas Elsaesser, it will help you to understand what this movie is all about, how it was made, and many details that help in the plot.  I hope they update it as well to include the new footage.s all about, how it was made, and many details that help in the plot.  I hope they update it as well to include the new footage.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It's a must for everyone's DVD collection.  The only thing I would have like to see deleted from the movie was when one character calls another character a \\"b@*#h\\". But thank goodness, that's the only swear word in the movie.
B0040QYROK|4.0|I filed this review today for the Moroder version, but as it contains my thought after viewing both simultaneously, I am putting it here with some additional text  I have all 3 versions of Metropolis now, the older B/W scratchy version with generic music, the Moroder version and the new Fully Restored Blu-Ray version.  Which one is best?  NONE OF THEM...  They are all different experiences.  I will give my take on all 3, bear with me!    The original DVD version is not worth the money, scratchy and poorly made.

If Lang were alive and still active, I bet he would tighten up the scenes a bit.  Some go on too long, but they reflect the editing attitudes of their time period.  The 16mm inserts add valuable information in the story and help explain the motivations, my complaint about it is that alot of it is really not new scenes (okay a few are), most of is just reaction shots.  Example, Joh Frederson summons the \\"thin man\\".  In the Moroder version we see him enter, camera cuts to Joh telling him to follow his son, camera cuts to thin man nodding his head.  Restored version, we see him enter, we now see him slowly walk forward, camera cuts to Joh telling him to follow his son, camera cuts to thin man nodding his head we see him leave. Was that extra scene of him walking toward Joh really needed??? No, but it goes on like this, extra reaction shots, extra establishing shots, etc.  I wish that the editors instead of relishing in all of the found footage had instead used some discretion and only used that which made narrative sense, as in the \\"thin man\\" scenes where his role is expanded and clarified.  We SHOULD relish that this is how it was seen, but we must also consider that narrative storytelling has changed since this film was made.  The complete version is an interesting timecapsule as to film making by a master, but I continue to believe that if he were alive and given this footage again today-he would recut it for a modern audience, even if all of the film was physically in pristine condition.  The music, did not appeal to me, the Huppertiz (sp?) score while vast and lavish is also overdone for a modern audience.  As I mentioned above the incidential music, such as when you see the opening scenes of the gears and machines running superimposed is just wrong (to a modern audience) it reminded me of the old Newsreels from WWII you see in museums \\"....Modern industry girds up for increase war production....\\" it fits an industrial newsreel but not a movie.  I would compare the score with that from Gone with the Wind, with GWTW the score is instantly memorable, the opening alone bespeaks of the grandeur of the story.  The Huppertiz soundtrack, not so much, almost generic silent film orchestration.  In the general incidential music, the Moroder soundtrack is better here.    I also miss the tinting.  So which version is best, hard to say.  I had the pleasure today of running both on my 22 inch monitor this morning side by side, more or less doing a direct comparison.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|This movie is just OK.  It's nowhere near as good as the last movie.  I only bought this because it's so cheap.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I read the reviews for this box set and was initially disappointed, to the extent that I nearly didn't order.  After all, I have the movies on DVD, and my Blu-Ray player does a great job of upscaling, so the Blu-Ray version is not strictly necessary for me.  That said, the Blu-Ray is just a better all-around experience given the choice.  The price seems alright for this set, but I did better, thus the 4-star rating and not 5.  Instead of ordering this box set, I went to the UK Amazon website and bought it there (amazon.co.uk) for about half the price.  An excellent option, considering I got all 8 movies and additional special feature content for around $45 (and region-free discs).
B001RCD2DW|5.0|MADE IN AUSTRIA. Granted this pair of headphones is not suited to all music genres coming across as thin and neutral for heavy metal or most loud bass heavy music, however it comes to a class of its own  when most of one's repertoire is Jazz Vocals and Accoustic instrumentals (Guitar, Flute, Cello).  And yes, it does not tolerate or flatter poor recording, rather focussing itself on the most accurate and neutral reproduction of good quality audiophile recordings.  Much have been said about its neutrality but with these there is no hearing fatigue and allows one to remain sublimely teleported into audio heaven for hours.<br /><br />I find myself gravitating back to this pair for almost all of my repertoire.  The soundstage is outstanding. And distortion - nil. Extremely comfortable to wear. Lightweight . Wire frames allow easy hanging-up after use.  Comes with both sizes of quality gold-plated jacks.<br /><br />I have recently readded the use of the fiiO E7 DAC (an experiment) to it and found that it does subtly smoothen out the edges (which I didn't realise existed) and round off the higher registers which was just discernible.  As for the bass, I've found setting EQ to +1 helps deepen the bass and give it a rather pleasing signature for more bass involved music like Black Eye Peas, U2, BonJovi etc.<br /><br />Highly recommended with (above) caveats but not everyone will like it. The Ultimate Gentleman of Headphones esq. Not pushy. Quietly dignified and delivers big within its domain.<br /><br />Also own<br />AKG 271MKII (studio recording pair)<br />Senheisser 598 (all rounder with some bloat)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|While I dislike Stephen King as a human being, he is an excellent storyteller which is why I continue to purchase his books. This book is another excellent addition to his works. It's almost outside his normal genre and it really makes you think. The protagonist was very likeable and you can feel the protagonist's needs and feelings. Usually I give a big thumbs down whenever King brings his politics into his novels (save me the indoctrination, please) but it's to be expected a bit here and is actually done with class.  What I did not like about this book was there was little mention in regards to the science behind the time travel involved beyond mysterious entities. The antagonists were a bit too sympathetic so it was difficult to rally behind his cause.  Although the book has it's flaws, it's still a tremendous read and ranks up there among one of my favorite Stephen King books of all time.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I really like this box set.  And even though the original music is absent (which does make it seem a little too quiet), the dialogue is still super funny.  I have no major complaints.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|This is a great holiday cd. Zooey Deschanel has a wonderful voice, and all of the songs have their own spin on the original versions. I love it!
B000OP1M6M|1.0|Beautiful watch that was available for a very low price on the day I ordered (just lucky), and it arrived sooner than expected.  Gave it a few shakes (as described in the manual) to start the movement, set the time and day/date, shook it about 10 minutes to give it a good winding, then set it aside.  Checked it about one hour later and found it had already stopped.  Gave it a few shakes to get it going again, but it stopped in about 10 seconds.  Repeated that severall more times, but the watch just would not continue running.  Returned it as defective.

1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is a new style for Mr. King, and I own nearly all of his books.  The human mind and body, similar to the story line in The Dome, is an amazing subject to read about. King is able to get into the head of everyone of his characters and take you on an incredible journey of what-ifs and what-abouts. 11/22 is also my birthday so I have a special connection with JFK, this book brings him back to us in a special way.  King continues to evolve and show us his deep emotional connection to his stories that he shares as only King does, by taking you inside each characters head and helping that video that we create be real and irresistible.  Bravo Stephen King, you never cease to amaze me, and for those who dont read King because it is too scary or dark, treat yourself to 11/22/63.  You will think about this book long after you have finished reading it, another 200 pages would have been just fine.
1451648537|4.0|I read it straight through because I was fascinated at the hubris of this man who took it upon himself to decide what people needed, rather than asking them what they wanted. In doing so, he made his \\"dent in the universe.\\" And, I love my Apple Mac. But, what the books reveals about the man behind the apple isn't pretty. He was selfish, arrogant, greedy, vain and a total cad with all women, except his wife. His last words before dying, \\"Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow\\"- courtesy of Mona Simpson's eulogy, however, have left me wondering what he saw in his morphine induced haze. All in all, I say READ this book, if for no other reason than he was a visionary.
0307387178|5.0|There are so many things our society has convinced us we cannot live without. We can't live without seeing the latest movie, or last night's big game. We can't live without owning a cool car, a good stereo system, a fast internet connection, and an iPod. We can't live without big houses, without adding more space to our big houses, and without owning extra houses for when we need a vacation from our so-hectic lives. We can't live without fast food, without burgers, sodas and fries, yet we also can't live without health food, without nutrient-enriched fruit drinks, granola bars, and yogurt. We can't live without Chap Stick, Tylenol, toothpaste, and shaving cream; digital cameras, chain restaurants, rock concerts, and educational toys for our children. We can't live without 'being number one.' Without watching our favorite team play, without a cool looking pair of sneakers, without owning the most-advanced set of golf clubs, or without becoming an expert at the latest fad in video-gaming.<br /><br />Meet Chris McCandless, or rather, 'Alex' as he has recently rechristened himself. A recent graduate from the prestigious Emory University with a 3.82 GPA, Alex decided to stop being a part of our society. He donated the $25,000 in his saving account to charity, and started to live a life free of expectations, obligations, and all the superficial 'needs' that everyone else seems to spend their time obsessing about. Both the book and the film are marvelously done; the result is a mesmerizing reverie on the difficulty of establishing and sustaining deep, meaningful relationships.

0553582038|4.0|It is hard to follow up the action and excitement of Storm of Swords. The previous installment of A Song of Ice and Fire had so much twisting, turning, and excitement, it's hard to match it, and the final product, A Feast for Crows, is evident of that. That isn't to say Feast is bad; it is, like George R. R. Martin's previous installments, a page-turner, and like the previous books, the characters still shine, both new and old.  While A Feast for Crows is not as action-packed as A Storm of Swords, it still retains much of what makes the series great.  Because of the parallel story taking place in A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, some favorite characters are missing: both Tyrion Lannister and Danaerys Targaryen are absent from the book, and Jon Snow makes only a short appearance at the beginning. Because of this, forgotten characters and new characters become central to several of the chapters. the Greyjoys return, with Asha and her uncles Victarion and Euron competing for the throne in the Iron Islands' war of secession. Just as well, the Ironmen become much more prevalent to the story. There's also a location shift to the mysterious Dorne, which had been unseen in the first three books. The introduction of Arianne Martell as a perspective character also gives readers a new scope into the goings-on of Dorne, with many other new characters to engross the reader, such as Areo Hotah, Aerys Oakheart, and the gout-infested prince of Dorne, Doran Martell. Of course, some former perspective characters make their returns as well. Jaime Lannister, Samwell Tarly, and Brienne of Tarth, and the Stark sisters remain POV characters.   However, possibly the most welcome POV is one of the most hated characters in the series: Cersei, the queen regent. The first three books in the series made Cersei a cartoonish villain, and her perspective characters now round her out, even if she still remains the sneaky, contemplative, power-hungry queen. Seeing the inside of Cersei deepens her as a character, and her character development is very welcome.  However, Feast is not without problems. Reading Brienne's and Sam's chapters are difficult and slow, and the first book is rather tedious. At times, it feels as if the story is stagnant. Brienne seems to go nowhere for half the book, Sansa remains in the Eyrie babysitting her cousin Robert until the very end, and Sam is constantly uncomfortable with everything going on around him, though by the end of the book he does step out of his comfort zone, and it makes his last few chapters much more enjoyable. The Dorne storyline, which had so much potential in the book, fizzles in the end, and the Ironmen storyline ends rather abruptly.  Make no mistake, this isn't as action-packed as A Storm of Swords either. There are only a few scenes involving fighting or battles, though they are still great to read thanks to Martin's descriptive writing style. Most of the tension takes place in political embroilments in King's Landing, where Cersei is planning on taking down the young queen Margaery Tyrell, though the new King Tommen is making things very difficult for her. Even with this tonal shift, storylines still remain pretty strong. Arya adjusts easily to her new life in Braavos, though she still has her badass moments and Jaime's development from cocky soldier to anti-hero is written beautifully.  So while A Feast for Crows is far different from its predecessor, and it does start slowly and with quite a few bumps, it is still a welcome addition to the series. It is hard to read this after A Storm of Swords, but A Feast for Crows remains true to A Song of Ice and Fire, and it's clear George R. R. Martin hasn't forgotten that what made the series so great in the first place wasn't the action, but the characters themselves. Whether you love or hate them, they are still developed wonderfully, and have as much heart as always.
B0057GYOA4|3.0|What people said about the sound is not a question, there's definitely a difference, I could say you can hear a lot more of the nicely played bass lines and the vox it's more in your face, but the guitars are really high end and that make a general noisy situation if you add the drums and cymbals, totally opposite to what you've had used every time re-visit this album...the whole new sound it's like a gig sound with a drunk guy handling the knobs and levels of the board, so forget about the listening experience.<br /><br />The digipack artwork is cool and hoped to see the lyrics but neither this time. The whole bunch of extra tracks are decent versions and really made out a comfortably package and make you feel a lot more connected to the original one, what of course it is an ambiguous situation isn't it?
076115728X|5.0|This book belongs up there with the best of the best interactive children's picture books. Every human makes mistakes, and every baby makes a mess, and this book focuses on the bright side of that fact: every \\"oops\\" is an opportunity for your imagination.   I thought it was a neat concept when I first heard about the book. But the execution is brilliant. I do a lot of graphic design and creative work, but I couldn't have done better myself.   And I love children's books that are not only fun (even the 100th time you read it), but also teach encouraging lessons in creative ways without lecturing the children. And the message it gives is really true: every \\"oops\\" is an opportunity for creativity.  I'm already thinking of several children I have to buy this for, because it's so neat! I'm off to order more!

B004UXUUDA|4.0|Sarah's Key is one of those movies that surprises you because it is not a Hollywood blockbuster and is a very good film. This French-English film deals with the 1942 round up of the Jewish people from the Jewish quarter of Paris and investigative reporter doing a story of in in 2009. Going back and forth, the wonders what the connection is.<br /><br />Soon we found that the apartment that the reporter is about to movie in to with her family is the same one a family was ousted from so many years earlier. Digging up the past brings back bad memories and suppressed secrets.<br /><br />I was intrigued from the very beginning of this movie and found myself immersed into the lives of these people. Kristin Scott Thomas is remarkable. Another one of those films that should not be missed.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|While a smaller handheld gaming system is ideal for casual gamers, there is nothing that can compare with carrying around your own full-blown mobile gaming platform. The G155 mobile system is perfect for any serious gamer, whether they are a fan of XBox or PS3.  Initially, the price made me wonder if this product was worth buying but now I am very glad I purchased it. My PS3 fits perfectly thanks to the molded console base (designed for PS3 or XBox) and two accessory bags means every cable and controller fits neatly inside. The screen is bright and colors are nearly perfect. My only complaint is the resolution. In GUI mode, 1080p is supported but this drops down to 780p while playing a game. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future. The screen response is fast.  The case is sturdy and can take a beating while protecting your sensitive console. While the provided grip is comfortable, the system is heavy once a console is installed and an optional shoulder strap would be nice, Luckily, there are heavy duty clips where a shoulder strap could be attached. I used one from an old messenger bag and it worked perfectly.  Overall this system is a big home run for anyone looking to mobilize their gaming platform. Also makes a fantastic gift!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Personally, I'm okay with soaking up GRRM's world-building and enjoying the journey. The quality of GRRM's writing was as good in books 4 & 5 as it was in 1-3; the only difference was that a lot of the scenes seemed to create more questions than answers. A Dance with Dragons was filled with character development, and assuming GRRM is going to tie up all loose ends in books 6 & 7, this is a 5-star book.

0307891402|4.0|So many positive rating that I'll just post the few minor problems I have with the guide. These are all problems that are purely my opinion and may not apply to everyone or anyone else.  *The paper for the guide feel lower in quality than most, if not all, other guides I have. I constantly feel as if I have to be very delicate or else the paper will rip. Some of the pages also seem to be warped. This was certainly not what I was expecting for my first Collector's Edition guide.  *The bonus online map's search could've been improved on. Several times when I typed in the name of a Shout, for example, completely irrelevant results would appear. It can be kinda slow to load at times as well.  *The organization of information can make things very confusing and a chore to navigate, especially when looking for that one quest or other specific info. A trip to UESP can solve this, though it negates the purpose of owning a guide.  *The very small font is kinda hard to read, though that's to be expected for a book this massive.  All in all the guide would've received at 5/5 if it weren't for the first bullet point. That one issue is large enough to take away a star. The other issues are very minor and not enough to punish the guide.
159102594X|5.0|I could go on about this book for ages, but I'll definitely say, this is a must read. With many fantasy novels throughout time, a certain majestic presence holds back the hard truths of actual life and the tole love, death and war can take. Abercrombie dashed that ideal scene with fire and danced in the ashes. This book is gripping in every chapter, truthful to the characters with every page. Here is an author who would not rob his audience of the more brutal aspects of a battle hardened life, nor take away a moment from the madness of a romance unintended or corruption unhindered. If you want a pleasant ride through beautiful woods with not but the river aside and a wonderful bottle wine waiting for its untested heroes, this is not your tale. If you would see into the minds of men and women affected by a harsh and barbaric world, fighting for what they believe in, people with Real feelings and Real emotions, Read this book. You will not regret it.

These two have pure and beautiful vocals, indeed a country singer. Humble. Not like those who claimed themselves as country but they are actually not, Taylor Swift. She is just pop. Sorry  Recommended songs in Clear As Day: The Trouble With Girls, Clear As Day, Water Tower Town, Back On The Ground.  Ratings: 4/5
0525423656|5.0|This book is pefect for anyone 10+. I do not reccomend this to anyone under 9 or 10 because they might not entirely understand the plot of this book. I still think this is the best book ever and you should get it. (Make sure you've read Matched first.)
0807262013|4.0|As with the other audio productions in this series, the audio is fantastic. A full cast really brings the story to life. This is great because the story itself is flatlining compared to its preceding installments.<br /><br />I read this book when the abominable Golden Compass movie came out. I mentioned to a friend that I was listening to this on audiobook. She told me that the Amber Spyglass did not come out on its advertised release date because it was SO HUGE, and Philip Pullman had to spend a few more more months editing it down to digestible size. We're not sure if that's true, but I believe it.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass is heavy and long. It says a lot, while somehow managing to feel like it's leaving a lot out.<br /><br />Audiobooks always draw my attention to a problem I don't notice when reading: bloated dialogue. The Amber Spyglass is filled with SO MANY monologues. There is way too much exposition for a final installment in a trilogy. Pullman spends an extraordinary amount of time with world-building too. Yes, the world of the Mulefa is interesting, but it's awfully late in the game to introduce it. The pages spent constructing this world could have been better used to more adequately wrap up the storylines of characters who we have been following for two books now.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife is a lot of tense build up. The Amber Spyglass fizzles, very anti-climatic. Because the audio is so good, I give it 4 stars versus 3 stars to the book alone.
0553381695|3.0|I've read the first two books (Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings).  Game of Thrones had me hooked.  All of the characters were fantastic to read about. The story progressed at a steady pace which concluded in such a fantastic way that I couldn't wait to pick up A Clash of Kings.  However, I've found A Clash of Kings to be a humongous speed bump.    Tyrion Lannister, in my opinion, will likely go down as one of the greatest characters in fiction.  But do I really have to read about his love of prostitutes over and over again?  I get it. He loves a \\"woman of the night\\" - move on.   The first book left off with Rob developing into this fantastic leader, much like his father.  His battle with the Lannisters near the end of Game of Thrones was amazing. It was written so well.  Fast forward to A Clash of Kings and Rob is  barely mentioned.  We certainly get nothing to read about from his POV. Instead you have to hear about Rob from Caitlyn's POV - who is as dull a character as you can imagine.    The development of Daenarys' character in Game of Thrones was great.  It's a shame that all came to a halt in the second book.  Although, I learned that she loves bath oils even more now - RIVETING!!!!    The White Walkers??  Don't worry about them.  I'm assuming Martin will remember his entire series began with them.  Maybe he remembered to write more about them in the next books.    Don't fall in love with any of the characters.  Martin will either kill them off or will forget to write about them.  The real issue I have is that when things started to get really interesting, Martin would end the chapter then force us to read about insanely dull characters like Sansa or Theon.  By the time he gets back to the character and story arc that piqued your interest you pretty much forgot what happened to make it so exciting or lost track of who is who.  All of the character names are as pretentious and confusing as the next.  With characters changing sides, name similarities, and hundreds of pages in between hearing about them it's easy to lose track and interest.  I have friends and relatives who are up to date on the series. Each one has said the same thing - it has not progressed.  They've found it exhausting to have to learn about a new character when they only really care about the novel's mainstays.  In only two books I've found that Martin is losing a grip on his world.  There is just too much going on.  White walkers; the wall; battles for the throne; a new character every other page without any word about your favorites, etc.  I just can't invest any more time into it.  Not when I hear it gets worse.   For now I'm going to throw in the towel.  Maybe I'll come back to it one day.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I take a lot of notes in my life. When I study, when I work, and when I am being creative. The problem is what to do with this mountain of paper. There is simply no filing system I have come up with that allows me to find what I'm looking for, even if I know it's in the pile somewhere!   Evernote allows me to take notes nearly as conveniently as paper, using all my devices, whichever is to hand. Only nearly, though, as I have yet to find anything that rivals the ease and convenience of paper.  Where Evernote exceeds paper is in its constant and thorough indexing. It really does make it possible for me to find a note at work in seconds that I'd otherwise have to go home and search for!  I haven't even found premium membership necessary, although I might soon upgrade - I'm starting to approach the free account upload limit on some busy months!

B000GBFQT8|5.0|This is the first book C. S. Lewis wrote in his Chronicles of Narnia series. Even though \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" occurs first chronologically (and is now listed as #1 in most sets), this book is a much better introduction to the land of talking animals and, more importantly, to Aslan. Though children from our world are the main characters in this (and other) Narnia stories, the true hero is Aslan, The Great Lion and Son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea.<br /><br />Though this is written as a fairytale for children it follows C. S. Lewis's philosophy that, \\"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.\\" Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book, besides being a fun fantasy story, explores a different aspect of His character. This book reveals Aslan as Redeemer.

0385523912|5.0|Award-winning journalist Barbara Demick of the Los Angeles Times' triumphantly successful 'Nothing to Envy' uncovers a romantically human side of North Korea and her disenchanted citizens. Surrounding six multifarious North Koreans' dramatic, decades-long oral histories are brilliantly told starting from humble, loyal beginnings to eventual controversial defection. This memorable documentation of ordinary citizens and their amazing survival through unspeakable danger and life-altering trauma is requesting only a receptive audience.  The reader gains a truly well-rounded viewpoint of the times from six different perspectives. From the propped-up and powdered Pyongyang façade to the gritty and industrial Chongjin rail yards, this overarching story starts in the homes of many ordinary citizens who survived countless obstacles growing up in the notoriously restrictive The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Some fortunate few were hand-picked to attend prestigious universities while others had practical duties to provide for their families any way possible. Others still, like homeless children infamously known as \\"kotjebi\\", wondered the streets in packs and stole to survive.   Among the personal anecdotes include a dumbfounded medical physician's practical denial of Kim Il-sung's 1994 death. Also, seemingly regardless of social class and family backgrounds, all eventually felt the squeezing grip of famine sweeping across the country in the late 1990s known as the Arduous March. It was through this increasingly inescapable reality that survival became paramount included any and all options; no matter how illegal or dangerous. Each story's journey is more astonishing than the last. Most satisfying is when the reader finds out what they have been up to since the original manuscript was constructed.  Demick's writing style evokes a pleasantly familiar tone. While reading, I drew respectable comparisons to John Hersey's groundbreaking classic 'Hiroshima'. Lo and behold, Demick was a student of Hersey's which makes 'Nothing to Envy' a successful nod of appreciation to his tutelage. Like Hiroshima, you'll find a similar chronological pacing of alternating narrators as well as develop a personal attachment to the people who tell their remarkable journey in amazing lucidity.  I can recommend this book without reservation as it will obviously appeal to human rights minders, North Korean experts looking for oral history reports, and a handful of academics interested in totalitarian dictatorships, wide-spread economic systems failure, and human trafficking. I also want to earnestly suggest this book for the intimate character-driven narratives that appeal to any and all. You feel for this people. You realize that they are no different than any other ordinary people born into extraordinary circumstances. Some were disillusioned with their government from the get-go while others were staunch supporters of their ideology. For better or for worse, their sincere stories are unabashedly told here.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I've searched for an app that is easy to use and doesn't require tedious manual entry when I want to move an event to a different time/day. This fills that role and does it better than I'd hoped.   I was hesitant about diving in and buying the app without trying it first. I tried to find it in demo form, but it doesn't exist. I found a link to their website that shows a .mov with drag and drop functionality and that sold me.  I can easily add events simply by title and length and ignore the time and date.  This allows me to add a ton of events very quickly. From that point on I can drag and drop them into time slots that work for me without manually adjusting times. That was a must for me. Quick, quick, quick. I can also add reminders that will audibly notify me even when my Kindle Fire is asleep.  It's a great app and I'm happy to have found it.
1439192812|3.0|I borrowed this book from my local library. I usually do this for a quick review. If I like the book I order it from Amazon; if I don't like it I return it asap to the library. I returned it the next day.  This book is for a secular student in the middle grades in school.   The discussions are bland and secular. Dawkins reviews cosmology for an entire chapter and admits he doesn't understand cosmology as he isn't a cosmologist. But that doesn't stop him from discussing it.  Another point is the \\"artwork\\". The illustrations are irrelevant to the discussions. Weird drawings meant to represent what the author is trying to explain. Sort of a 70's art view. Pointless, really.  Because Ricky Gervais \\"loves\\" this book that should give you a hint of the seriousness of Dawkins writing.
0312641893|5.0|Wow!  This is definitely a WOW book for me.  I never would have thought to read it if it wasn't for all the early reviews raving about how awesome it is.  So when I had the opportunity to review it myself I totally jumped at the chance and I do not regret it!  This book was so full of awesome that the second I finished I immediately convinced about six others that they MUST read it!  And they are!<br /><br />I am not really into sci-fi unless it's more of the fantasy variety.  This one is futuristic with androids and cyborgs and aliens.  Totally not my thing usually.  But Cinder is basically a normal girl.  She hides that she's a cyborg as much as she can because it seems they are kind of looked down on, like they aren't fully human.  But she is.  I mean she has a human brain and still thinks like a normal girl.  And she was completely real and like-able to me.  I connected with her right off the bat and 'got' her.  She was funny and compassionate but she was dealt such a rough hand that she was a bit cynical, or she forced herself to be anyway, trying to convince herself that she was 'less'.  No one would like her if they knew she was cyborg, etc.<br /><br />The other characters were great as well.  The prince was totally not prince-like.  I mean, he wasn't full of himself.  He was funny and he was also compassionate and like Cinder he was dealt a rough hand.  Though it's completely different because yes, he's a prince, but he's suddenly thrown into this tough position and his decisions mean the fate of his country.  But he had a clear head and struggled to do his best in deciding what to do.  But one thing that wasn't a struggle for him was Cinder.  At least as far as we see.  They are continuously running into one another and he doesn't even hesitate to be kind and gently flirtatious with her.  And though he doesn't know she's cyborg he does know she's not royalty and he still pays her attention.  I totally loved him for that.  And don't worry, yes- he's completely swoon-worthy!  He's not a bad boy, but he's still swoony!<br /><br />The stepmother was definitely evil and had me so angry!  I totally wanted to reach in and strangle her.  Same with the one stepsister.  The other one was kind and has her own story but I don't want to spoil it for you.  The Cinderella part of the story was perfect.  It was definitely it's own retelling but still followed along enough that it was pretty obvious that it was a retelling of Cinderella.<br /><br />The sci fi elements were important but somehow the book was never heavy.  There wasn't lots of long descriptions or a ton of backstory.  For me it was perfect.  I got enough that I wasn't confused but not so much I felt overwhelmed.  I thought the world building was good but some may feel it's lacking because we don't really learn a whole lot about things from before.  But really, I thought it was perfect and in future books I'm sure we'll learn much more.<br /><br />This was a clean read that had me on the edge of my seat.  While it's fairly long I read it in only a day because it was so good and was fast paced.  I very highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book free of charge through the amazon vine program for review purposes.

B005SJIP2S|3.0|A lot of negative has been said about this CD and I think it is better than what I have read. I've given it a good listen and I enjoyed it. I've seen every line up of YES since 1979 so I'm not going to place judgement on a CD without Jon or Rick since the Drama album and tour were actually one of my all time favorites (though Going For the One is my number one YES album).<br /><br />I think songs like Heart of the Sunrise, Machine Messiah and Roundabout sound great on this CD. Steve puts his own flavor on the solo for Owner of a Lonely Heart which is nice to hear a different way and Benoit David sounds very good thru most of the CD. He is best on the Drama material, Owner of a Lonely Heart and Heart of the Sunrise. There are places on the CD where he isn't spot on but then give the man some credit, he is singing songs originally sung by Anderson, Horn or Rabin and he does a nice job of it. A few times he doesn't hold pitch but would you rather have Autotune?<br /><br />Oddly enough Steve disappoints on Tempus Fugit, but I think this was more the mix or the effects on the guitar than the performance. Not quite sure. Astral Traveller is quite nice and hearing Squire sing is always nice.<br /><br />I give it three stars because I didn't LOVE it, but I will play it again and I did enjoy it. Most of the mix is pretty good too.
