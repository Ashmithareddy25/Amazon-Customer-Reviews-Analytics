B001FQOGFS|4|So far it's service the job
B00ALH2JRO|5|Perfect.
B003UVCY00|1|My kids got me one of these for my birthday and it seemed really nice until I actually got it wet. My neighbor at the marina had a chair blow off the dock and I used the light to try to find it so we could retrieve it. I merely held the lens under the water and it hasn't worked since. Of course it is beyond the 30 day return date. Not a solid product, glad my safety wasn't at stake.
B0085MEWKY|5|It did unfortunately, My boyfriend and I broke up and I don't need it anymore, but it is a beauty and very well made fit perfect just did not get to use it
B0009V1WTS|3|A a bit short for a tow bar. Be careful on lenth.
B00AUINNPG|5|Fast delivery good product
B0091OE6K6|1|This does not solve problem.  When you attach the product to the lap portion of the belt and then connect the shoulder portion to the product as directed, the shoulder portion of the belt constantly pulls upward on the product causing it to turn inwards and into your stomach area. Very uncomfortable.
B00Y4NJGTK|2|I got the product on time, but, my key does not perfectly fit the case.  If I increase the spring tension (2 turns) and fold the key, it does not rest flat on the side of the case. To make it rest on the side when folded, I have to reduce the spring tension to 1 turn. The downside is that the key does not flip open when I press the button. Anyway, I left it at that state and just press on the key root to manually flip the key open.  It is better than having the key protrude by half an inch on the side when folded.  I noticed the alignment holes on the case are not the same as the holes in my original key.
B009YMJWEA|5|Gr8
B00V5BTCYI|5|Used it and when we had a big rain storm it worked great. The water beaded up on the top. The color seemed more even after just one treatment. Very pleased with the product. Would recommend to my friends with convertibles.
B00UAH8X98|5|Fits like a glove. Looks great, feels great. Thanks
B0095XJW8Y|5|Good product!
B002MQCY7C|5|Very easy to install on my helmet. Works great.
B00F2505DK|5|Nice quality product
B00YSVHTJC|5|I think we finally found our &#34;Man&#34;. He's riding a white horse, too... :P
B004K9KETY|5|Heavily diluted, works great to clean and leave an amazing gloss and if you mix up a stronger batch, it does well at cleansing away old protectants so you can start fresh.
B00WFA3DDY|5|Was happy with product when I finished. Instructions could have been better. I installed with camera upside down. Had to remove and disconnect wiring and clips I installed to keep wire up out of the way. I hooked rear camera to backup light. Installed monitor near cigarette lighter and used lighter to plug in. If I feel the monitor might get stolen I can disconnect easy wire connections and cigarette lighter plug. Really love it now. Give yourself time for install. Don't want wires exposed to road ice and snow, keep wrapped and up high out of the way.
B005M1ZBH4|5|It gives my 5.4L Expedition the GROWL it deserves. It felt so good throwing the ridiculous maze of intake plastic resonators on my lawn. My neuter the natural gasps this engine takes in!? Anyways, the instructions were garbage and I found a couple Youtube vids that helped. TOP TIP: Take the hose clamps completely apart before tightening them back. Also check the vids for proper rotation of the filter so it doesn't pop off when you slam the hood (like the other reviewer). LOVE IT.
B005NLQAHS|4|Little too tight to plug in to the OBD II port. Using Torque with it. Snyc nicely with EGR and does it exactly as expected. Took few beating(droped few time) holding up well.
B000EVWDAK|2|Did not work on my 2009 mitshibushi lancer. Was very disappointed
B00JFGKPSW|5|great scent that last
B005BNP7UO|5|Great, works as intended. Seems flimsy but they are really just a decorative piece.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Great size for my car. Really like the spot for a tissue box.  I think this will work great.
B00CLPVBYQ|5|A++++++
B005S581ZS|2|did not plug into my 08 patriot as advertised
B005NLQAHS|1|DOES NOT WORK WITH A NISSAN LEAF!!!! Please update the listing. Seems like it works great on other rides (with free smartphone software)
B0006Z9SPW|5|We have three vehicles so it made more sense to get the bargain container. I prefer using it straight from the bottle rather than refilling the sprayer. The product stays on the applicator and doesn't get all over the rest of the vehicle like it does when using the spray bottle.
B0002SR4Q8|1|Do yourself a favor and read the bad reviews before buying this.  It looks like they all have the same problem in that the spring arrives broken.  99% of this item feels like it is really good quality, except for that spring, which is trash.  Unfortunately, if you get one with a faulty spring the whole thing won't work.<br /><br />Not sure if this is a plus or a minus but this item didn't really cost enough for me to bother returning it for a refund, might as well chuck a 10 dollar bill in the trash if you buy this and are one of the unlucky ones to get one with a faulty spring.
B00OO2H3BO|4|Works great!
B0097YH972|5|Great addition to my outdoor set up.
B00E16M1S8|5|Put into a 2010 Toyota Prius. Installation was a two stage process. Step 1. The most important thing is to make sure you can get the rear hatch open, which requires the battery to be in place. This makes your job immensely easier. So I smartly jumped the car using the posts under the hood, and then opened the hatch and took out the battery so I knew which one to replace it with, and ordered this one on Amazon. No big deal, anyone with any mechanical aptitude at all can change the battery easily with a couple of metric sockets. It was in the rear trunk area, under several layers of easily removable parts, behind the rear passenger side fenderwell.<br /><br />But then I screwed up and didn't hook up the old battery again, so when the new one came, I couldn't jump the car to open the rear hatch. This was really annoying, requiring me lift the heavy new battery in from the rear passenger door and hook it up to the cables. Only then could I power up the car, open the hatch and finish installing it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, assuming that your battery is dead and you are ordering a new one from Amazon and can do without the car for the time it takes to ship the new battery to you. Remove the battery, figure out exactly which one you need, put the battery back into the car and hook up the cables to it and wait for the new one to come. Then jumpstart the car, open the hatch, and swap batteries. It'll save you some time and aggravation. Or leave the hatch open and park the car in a garage while you wait.
B0069A089S|5|excellent product!
B00CF280LM|5|good
B000X21Z7W|5|Nicely built and fit in nicely.
B001SHJLTU|5|Good stuff, Maynard
B001KOBBAS|1|Will not stay tight with vibration.
B0076PJXGO|2|For the money, I would have expected a better fit. These will fit with a little &#34;wiggling&#34;, but for what these are selling for, the fit should have been spot-on without any need for adjustment. I didn't feel like they belonged, and of course, I have returned these.
B0083G7ZHO|5|I was quoted $159 for this part from the dealer, not including installation. Bought it online and replaced it myself. Saved myself some money. The light from the bulb matches the oem part. Would definitely recommend.
B0041U5DKW|5|Fits great, but the install was a real pain.<br />Thanks, Toyota!<br />Next time (if there is a next time), I'd pay someone to do it. You have to rip the whole interior apart to get to the nuts.
B002U5ZUEY|1|Didn't fit my '09 Rhino
B0061RFZV0|5|These are a great way to cover up the drab charcoal color of the knobs of a Camero. Just make sure you clean the knobs with an alcohol prep first and apply the enclosed silicone adhesive well into the knurled area of the knobs and don't skimp on the adhesive. But be careful and make sure you wipe off any excessive amount before it cures or you could find that you glued your knobs in place making it difficult to turn! If you have a heads up display you have to get that cover separately. They make a great improvement in the appearance! !!
B005N72PIA|5|LOVE IT
B00OO2H3BO|5|Just what we were looking for.....something that is easy on easy off and protects the placard.  Perfrect!
B004STE5UA|5|thank you ..<br />excellent item and fast shipping
B000GV2100|5|They are smooth and there is no bump or rebound. No floating etc. Working great on my Sportster custom Trike.
B00MWH72IW|5|Well made and protects my antique car
B00IM39A6M|5|good quality plugs and with the new coils- purr purr purr
B00LJLHX22|2|Junk. Started flickering in about 2 days of use. Thank god they let me return them. The ones on eBay are half the price and usually last me about 6 months or so. Too bad they don't just work as they should. 2nd star for customer service.
B00VINMRD6|5|Came in fast, color matched, no instructions needed if you removed your old one, looks, feels, and is identical to the one removed, don't worry about it being flimsy or light, it's meant for that. Perfect fit, meets all my needs of minor repairs of a used car I purchased, for 3,000 less than blue book, thank you!
B0002F68JK|5|Works great!  Helps keep the motor home cooler and provides privacy.
B001FAK28E|5|Awesome purchase.  Easy to install and quick delivery.  Very happy with product.
B000KOTY3K|5|Great for the price and heavy duty
B00C53LX60|5|Had to take it to a dealer to program, just as the other reviews said, but it works perfectly with my Malibu
B00EEAD5I6|5|Product meets specification.  Quick delivery
B000KL73WW|5|Good fit!
B00K6498D0|1|Connector Cable does not work and merchant has not tech support or solution for these problems. It is cheap but we lost time and money. This imitation is just an scam.
B00XQ12JWC|5|This works insanely ridiculously good.  From the abrasive pen tip, the exact match paint, and the clear coat dabber.  I bought a 2011 ford escape from the dealer WITH scratches and blemishes.  You can't notice them anymore and had the dealer had this pen I would have paid an extra thousand for the car!
B009DJMW82|1|nooooooooo
B004QEF970|5|Ordered and installed hitch cover to protect against rust and improve appearance.  Installed with snug fit and looks good.  Happy with purchase.
B005FN228K|4|fit my odd shaped seats well, but the grab fur and lint easily and look messy because of it.
B0008F672C|5|Bolted these to my 94 jeep yj's frame and had to put them to the test that week.  They held up great while getting pulled out of a mud pit I had no chance of getting through alone.!
B00Q4WINK2|3|Ok quality... The shape is not quite right.  The right edge of the m is curved, which makes it look a bit cartoonish.  The stripes are acrylic infilled which in theory is nice, but its not totally even and kind of sags in the middle.  Its a nice enough peice... But if youre really picky, I'd say move along! I didnt end up using it on my car.
B0006IX7Y2|5|Arrived with a broken handle. Very quick response for replacement, even delivered on a Sunday by USPS.<br /><br />This will resolve my drainage issue for my camper. Seems very sturdy and well built.
B00BVPOC20|5|Perrrrfect!!! Changed it myself. I love amazon and youtube. Its all a girl needs.:)
B00BG3G83S|5|Perfect fit and very easy to install, had no problems making it work, with help from a friend it was a 30 min job to change from the old to this one.
B0096R0BU2|4|No regrets with this purchase. I've ridden in below freezing conditions for two hours straight and didn't get cold. Of course I had more layers and a wind-proof heavy-duty rain suit but I could tell the difference.
B00937YVXI|5|Worked great, pluged right in and fit good
B0006IX7TW|5|VERY GOOD!!!!! *****
B006ACYXTQ|5|Shipping was a little off but nothing big seller was really nice and helpful. Both mirrors fit on my 2002 dodge ram 1500 perfect, if I ever need anymore will definitely order from him .
B006Z907TY|5|This product met my expectations. I'm very pleased. Thank you!
B00IZ0XU9K|5|fast delivery  perfect fit, better than originals
B00RZ4Z3GK|4|Good hand full of switches at a low cost. One of them did seize up on me after about 5 or 6 uses but even four at this price is still a good value in my book.
B0040D2TGG|5|like the originals
B00DJDXL5Q|5|Excellent quality and all around buy!
B0009IQZH0|5|I love this shine microfiber towels. This does the job particularly for my Jet Black Bmw. I feel it absorb the compound and polish faster than their competitor counterparts.
B001U0FD8S|5|Bought the 900 peak amp unit about three or four years ago.. After the initial charge, I couldn't kill this thing. I jumped a few cars, my riding mower every week and even inflated the mower tires. I t will hold a charge for a long time. Loaned it to my brother til he gets a battery and that was 7 months ago. If he used it every day it  still performs well when he returns it in a day or two, I'll give it ten stars cause this dude tears up everything he touches.
B007PYC5MK|4|excellent
B000C9F7S4|1|Bad right out of the box. No wonder price was to good to be true. Had to pay full retail at local Napa to get a working compressor.
B000CAXHLC|5|Used this Belt on My 2002 Hyundai Accent. IT fits as the AC Compressor Belt.
B00HCSBWD2|5|Look great in headlights.
B0007T36CS|5|Yes - and for anyone having trouble finding a Outback 2004 hood deflector - it is because Subaru called the Outback in 2004 a Legacy - I had a terrible time finding this - until I found a forum on Subaru - but it fits perfectly and looks great-
B004MDEVDI|5|Good no hassle if you're car have the right setting
B00M7DPC1K|4|Arrived quickly...not as easy to change as lead to believe but was finally able to get it replaced. Will see how long the ring lasts. Installed with 114 hrs. on ski.
B005DETD2O|5|Great price
B000C5YD1A|5|Fit my 2005 WRX perfectly and fixed the P0031 CEL code.
B00HE686DG|1|Read the reviews!!! This product is a waste of money. It was dried up and could not use.
B00IZALAOW|5|Fingerless gloves have the disadvantage of being difficult to remove, especially when your hands are sweaty. You should know that going in, but it applies to all fingerless gloves. Having said that, these are comfortable and well made. I would buy them again.
B009TALNSU|4|very nice, just not enough cover under gas pedal so the dirt and water from shoe gets under the mat
B000C01AIO|5|THIS BRAND FIXED THE OTHERS  PROBLEMS AND INCLUDED A GASKET.
B00BQN5SUW|5|Got this item way before expected delivery date. Item works great and was very easy to install!
B000FQBWCY|5|This is an awesome battery maintainer.  I store my 2010 Polaris 800 RZRs in the garage and can go a couple months without starting it.  The CTEK works great on keeping the batteries (Main and isolated Aux) at peak charge.  I have it connected through a quick disconnect I mounted on the dash and super easy to just plug and play.  I looked at several options and after talking with my brother in law who builds and races street cars he highly recommended CTEK.
B00NGOS90A|5|Thought it would not stick but 115 degrees and it is still ther months later
B001FAM322|5|Love all the Rugged Ridge Euro Guards.
B0054JTZTO|5|Great product & Fast Shipping!
B00K802W08|5|This sticker is amazing !
B001O0GHCA|4|Arrived on time and packaged well. Fit factory xterra rims and look great.
B0100P4G9K|5|Works great and can't beat the price.
B00M0P2LZK|2|The pegs were shipped extremely quick but the pins that were included were not long enough to fit my 04cbr1000rr. Also after installing the foot pegs they did not sit flat against the bracket so they were a grind to fit part but I expected some problems because of how cheap they were
B0037N40EY|5|perfect fit
B00IZFNJ6Y|4|Does what it's supposed to do. Wish the manual had a little more information. (Tell you how to know what type of battery your testing). Simple test though.
B000BUQOFO|4|Did great, but they do slide, at least on blacktop, so it may take a time or two to get your vehicle up on them.
B000SOKE5E|2|Waists fuel because about 1/4 inch is needed to reach the filter. Every use leaves the same amount of residual, irregardless of water content.
B0013TNFEA|5|Lawn mower is running like new! My 8 year is on lawn duty now that he can start the mower
B00UW4X2WC|5|good
B00IO9CR3W|5|So far so good. My mechanic liked the rotors. He said the brakes will function cooler.
B00K5L8CPO|1|What a debacle this product created.  Despite faithfully following instructions, the nozzle clogged on the fourth tire.  This turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  Over-spraying even a little bit required tedious and laborious effort to get off the wheels and the wipe down renders the cloths useless for anything else.  By week two there was what I would call &#34;pitting&#34; on the three tires.... spaces where it was obvious the product was no longer present.  Looked ridiculous and required yet more effort to remove from the rest of the tire.  An absolutely terrible product.
B0069UJ18C|5|good product
B00NMVYA00|5|Great fit! Yellow is holding bright and vibrant after 5 washes! My favorite shirt right now
B001CMV6KS|5|love it
B000B8VWP8|5|worked as it should.
B000RXNLK6|5|A+
B005EPLJ9W|5|Took me 2 minutes to look up how to change it out on YouTube and 3 minutes to install. Great product and easy replacement for the original make this a very good value.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Great cargo carrier. The quality is fantastic
B00IPS4APU|4|Just a week after I had a new windshield replaced, wouldn't you know it a rock chipped my lower drivers side windshield, leaving a star shaped chip the size of a dime. I bought this product after doing a bit of research. I followed the directions by doing the actual repair in the shade on cool glass, and once I was satisfied, let the product bake in the sun. It &#34;fixed&#34; about 90% of the damage. You can see in a couple of spots where the tiny fissure cracks did not get filled. With that said, I do have the option of going back in and repairing those (as there is enough product to do so) and I believe I could bring it up to 100% satisfaction.<br /><br />I appreciate that the damage is not in my sight of field or where the wiper blade touches it, so I am currently not bothered by it. I do believe though, that the final repair outcome will depend on what kind of damage you have. I think that is why some of the reviews are skewed. Just remember, complete the job in the shade and finish the job with sunlight, otherwise your finished product will indeed, be the pits.
B0041C975C|5|Went right on. Took 15 minutes. She really likes it
B003C016XA|5|just as described
B000LS7JH8|5|Need this with the hammock
B00ELHTE5A|5|Love it
B00BCRMC1U|1|Look nice in pkg. Don't fit seats.
B00BLVVVPU|5|Perfect
B00ZXOSGCW|5|I purchased this to put into the center console of a car I am building.  I was very impressed by this, it is quality made and has the features I wanted.
B000CGK0AC|1|Installed the pressure regulator and it makes a buzzing sound... It's working but it makes a very annoying buzzing sound
B000C9I45C|5|Just what I needed with on time delivery.
B000C802QW|5|Perfect helped me with Falla was presenting the radiator is easy to install just need the right measure in the tool and ready.
B005LXTOHQ|3|Worked fine
B00Q3WWM8C|3|I use it in my car to blow air conditioning to the back seat where my dogs are in their crates while going to the shore.  It helps, but somewhat noises.
B004GCHNEO|3|Quality decent for the price. The only problem were the ears where u install the parking lights. They were not contoured right which made installing the lights difficult
B00A448NYW|4|Pretty damn sweet, 4 stars because I left them on and I went on vacation then my s*** was dead
B00913ON1O|2|While the fitment was better than that of a generic seat cover, the build quality left a lot to be desired- especially considering the cost.  One of the 3 headrest covers came with the bottom flaps sewn backwards, rendering it unusable.  The rear sections had the center section sewn extremely crooked- there are lines on them that were several inches off from one side to the other.  Save yourself the headache, and buy the OEM seat covers, which are only a few $ more expensive.
B00498IK1A|5|Easy replacement of broken mirror. Looks good as new
B004CS3BPW|1|wrong lock
B00JRRVBKA|5|I use this after shampooing up urine and it helps a lot to remove remaining odors.  I let is sit over night then vacuum it up.
B00COYNZJ8|2|I was gifted this last christmas and had to throw it away due to A) The print fading in the sunlight and B) the plastic got brittle and started flaking all over the car.  So disappointed.
B001TIZZWA|5|Great
B00GT2FUB2|1|Brand New and wouldn't hold a charge.  I'd love to have actually had the opportunity to try it out, but alas I will be looking for a different brand after this experience.
B00LEBLI82|5|Nice lights.
B00E94KGBG|1|This is a bad Window tint kit the scraper is made out of metal and it cut me when I picked it up..
B00M06871Q|5|Was everything advertised and more!<br />Strong, good looks and a breeze to install
B00OM8AWBI|5|I would recommend these for your F250.  This came up as not fitting my 2011 F250 but actually fits like a glove.  I can’t comment about how well these will hold up but I can cover fit and initial quality.  They arrived quickly.  I have been through half a dozen seat covers for my truck and these far exceed the quality on anything I’ve had.  As for fit these are great with Velcro and buckle straps Vs elastic and hooks.  Very nice initial quality on these.  The seat back and bottoms are separate which makes for a great fit.
B00B5ZYY38|4|Fairly good quality set, did not work with my plates so I ended up using a different set of screws and did not get the benefit of the other things included in this kit.
B00J6305ZM|5|Work for my personal truck
B00DP4LHTQ|5|Excellent product.  I wish I had found this 5 years ago! :)
B001EQN92U|3|Very comfortable gloves, but neither of the two sets that I have owned lasted more than 6 months of daily use.
B00DQJ8Y4G|5|fits perfect on my 2001 z06
B0087NB1IW|5|Very happy with this purchase.  If I knew riding with headsets would make my rides that much more enjoyable, I would have done it years ago.  So far no issues.  Great headset for the price.  You will need to do the firmware update and possibly due a factory reset as well.  Me and my buddy kept having issues with his cutting out now and then but I had done a factory reset and he didn't.  Once he did we have had almost no dropped connections.
B00B4KT3P8|4|Perfect fit
B00NF1Q8P2|4|Exactly matched the old unit.  But if you are looking for a splash shield that has a correctly positioned oil filter hole.... you will be disappointed.<br /><br />I cut a hole where it needs to be and now changing the oil on my wife's 2009 Mazda 3 is much easier.
B010OPSAH0|5|worked perfect
B001FCLSS0|5|happy customer
B001NAQSQG|5|Easy install, looks good and everlasting.
B00B9EZ2CW|5|worked perfect
B0098QMYTW|4|rear was super easy to install! Love it. Looks good. I'm not sure about the mounting on the front bumper, and that is why it gets 4/5 stars. Instructions would be nice
B00FT101VS|5|Works just like it should.
B000CJIWL8|5|look good and on time as expected
B007MVI15Q|5|fit my 2000 Honda Civic EX like OEM.  Super easy to install.
B000JUVCNU|4|hang on to your old one.  I just installed the perTronix into my Distributor.  When I opened the package the middle plate was not counter sunk for the screw.  I used the one from my old set.
B000VSYFFW|4|went on my 2015 tundra with no problem
B00NTU18KY|4|This product is a need to have for every IT person.<br />The meter gives direct information on what is going trough the cable.<br /><br />This product helps you eliminate bad cable or connectors and give correct information.
B001LHVOVK|3|Its a decent tool,wont read every car,but wirks on some
B003E7LJN8|2|There are no clear or concise instructions on how to install these brake lines they are made very well but when building from scratch it is very difficult to figure out
B00FJDRHVI|5|Look even better in person. Quality product, good price for how many decals you get.
B00EECKKZ0|5|Excellent replacement - Washer is now operating perfectly.  Thanks again to Amazon.
B009IK9KV8|5|These work great on my 2015 Jeep Cherokee
B0050FW648|5|This piston kit worked great for me. It gave me the piston, pin, clips, and rings for less than I could buy OE Honda parts indivdualy. The piston is inthe machine and it is running great. Thanks
B00IO9B0AI|5|Great, great, great. Delivery was great way before I was expecting. Thank you so much.
B0022ZR28Y|4|Use this for ATV riding and cutting the grass.  Its been great.
B001JT7AU4|4|Works fine, well made.
B000MNN4WQ|5|Heavy duty! These actually might be a little too big just to use to tie stuff down in the back of a truck. But they are great quality.
B0042KYS4I|5|Love them
B0054LGVE4|5|Easy to change out. Seems to have increased my gas mileage by about 1.5 MPG.
B00IPL1MYY|3|They move with the vibration of the engine.
B00CHQV7CU|4|Super cute!!!!
B00JKOEFVW|5|Works great......!
B002IV4TQ0|5|This gasket fit my engine perfectly.
B00FSOVGHO|5|Great carry on bag! Perfect size to take on vacation, very happy with the product. Red Bull Signature Series is one of my favorites! No complaints.

B000TYQB14|4|Snapped in easily and has worked fine ever since. Great product
B001MOSDVQ|5|Fits lx
B000CPI62W|5|Nice unit, tows great.
B0027UTJHQ|3|Mounted as it should tho the directions were not really that beneficial.  Waitin on azon to ship my winch itches!
B0024J6JMI|5|This tool is phenomenal.
B009XIY22C|4|Nice quality and good fit after finding a place to put it...
B0002JMFHK|1|I was very disappointed! Had no quick connect fittings on it and was advertised to have. The problem I think is they show a picture with three different colored hoses that is blurry and too small to make out the fittings. Could color make the difference? I don't know, I am not an A/C guy and if so they should post that in the description.<br />I did not send back and decided to go about finding the fittings to make this work but so far I have only the quick connect for the one end but still need a coupling to join the hose end to the quick connect...<br />What an aggravation!!!!
B000BO71M0|5|Spent a little extra on the 3M Scotch brand. Tried cheaper ones before. Not that I was not happy with other tapes, just 3M Scotch is the best there is and is worth every extra penny you have to pay.
B00KTHZ2EI|5|Everything went as planned.  Thanks!
B001DMDRY0|5|These are great!  Needed new ones for our RV Toad....the ones at Camping World were not long enough....these were perfect!
B00IPS4APU|2|Sorry guys, product may be good but I was really bad trying to fix it, I think it requires some skills that I don't have.
B00480GYF8|5|I took this to a local auto mechanic, and they replaced it for free. It was much cheaper buying it this way than buying the bulb from an auto store. Works very well and I am very happy!
B0031I2SLM|4|It looks good quality and it fixed as original the original piece
B00135IH3I|5|Fits my 1998 Harley sportster perfect, works great; clean, sturdy parts.
B00FEV2K94|5|Cover looks and fits great.
B008F1PMDG|3|For the money it's solid. Just requires lots of sanding to get rid of really bad molding marks. The fit was about half an inch short on the sides as well. I will probably look into a nicer lip in the future but this will do for now.
B00VGL820M|4|works as labeled
B000C2WDWE|5|Look good
B00HZB8XYC|4|I like it, it looks like the picture but it does not fit well on a curved surface
B000BWEH6K|5|Great and quick delivery
B001BNFVFE|4|Good quality
B002EOXIEA|5|love it
B000J2KPP4|4|Does lightbulby things good.
B0049ETH7K|5|perfect fit
B007JMTS14|5|I was unsure how to install these plugs, until i discovered the on line installation video.  These are very heavy duty.  Highly recommended.
B001U6ML8C|3|Look good but are a little small. Had to really stretch them to make them fit. I'm afraid they're going to rip.
B007FTV9Q8|4|Works great
B00WD9RPQS|1|I really am not happy with this purchase.  It came with the package messed up, dusty and the keychain itself looks scuffed up and used.  I feel like whoever the seller is took it off his personal keychain, shoved it in a box and sent it to me.  It wouldn't be all that bad except that I paid $18 WITH shipping and it looks like I paid ten cents for it at a garage sale.  I don't like to give bad reviews, but unfortunately this one deserved it.  My son picked it out for my husband's birthday which is in a few days so there's not much time to do anything about it...except to write this review for the smart person who will read this review and take my advice.  Save your money and move onto the next.  This keychain is really cute and perfect for the father/son superhero lovers, but just not worth it.
B00M0TLQ66|5|Great product!
B00AZ4QIN4|5|I ordered for my 2001 Civic Ex 2dr and it took a little longer then expected to get in( I'm talking 14 days) but I'm super happy it looks and fits great. Would definitely recommend.  I paid half of what I would have buying them from an auto parts store.
B001C97V4Q|5|It's fine.
B002GJQ1ZG|1|Wouldn't recommend. Take your tire to a professional.
B00B9F5SCK|5|Good
B00390VH96|5|works as advertised,takes a lil to get used to i never had anything similar to them before ,
B004EB12FS|4|I used this kit on a ten year old car. The white paint had begun to dull and this kit restored the paint to near new condition. It takes a lot of elbow grease though and next time I am buying an orbital polisher. Took about 4 hours to go through all the steps as instructed including washing the car first but well worth the effort. I will use this kit again and my only gripe is that the included clay bar is not nearly enough. Buy extra clay bars if you intend to clay your entire car which I recommend if it has never been clayed before.
B00NWODRLK|5|Perfect for the 1961 Massey Ferguson tractor...
B001AWRB04|4|Good product on time shipping
B00MQGFQRS|5|It works and I love it!! Even at 70mph!
B00FJW62WE|5|Great Quality, fits just like OEM
B000E35UV2|5|nice
B0007ZAJRM|5|working good so far...
B00GMSSYHK|3|Excellent! Fits my Ralliart as it should and good performance difference.
B011A4OFNW|5|Was easy to put on and looms good on my  15 Jeep Wrangler!!!!!!! Fast shipping!!!
B00FALVU9Y|2|Does not do a good job with tougher dirt.
B0077CSW04|5|Great quick
B009WQ3K7I|5|Fit great and keep all the dirt I track in confined to mat. Like the material. Not stiff like Weather Tek. Would highly recommend.
B000BZG5YE|5|Good
B00TUCOLYU|5|Excellent product!!! Great buy
B0068M7DZ4|5|I don't know if these are the OEM plugs that came with my 2007 Volvo S60 as those said &#34;Volvo&#34; on them, but they look the same and perform the same.  I got 75K from the originals and they still had some life left in them.  If these do as well, I'm happy.
B000P6UO2I|5|for my husband. he uses it at work. he loves it. it was alot cheaper here than anywhere else.
B00CQBOQLU|4|Fits right on. No problems. The bearings are a lot better than the one I removed.
B006NYJ1S4|5|Exact fit. Looks like very good quality, but how can one tell???  Can't see why the US made Camry's requires a different part number than the imported ones as they look identical.  Anyhow, this was for the American version.  Contrary to Amazon ad, it was not made in US.
B00TCN6DT8|5|Modified to fit a Honda rebel good quality nice look solid mounting easy to install
B00VNJ18AI|5|Just what she needed.
B00DJ4FMK2|5|Good oil
B00CMY37MK|1|Looks nice..... although cheaply made the red paint doesn't last long at all .....
B00W5RAIRQ|4|They were exactly hat I was expecting to get and very easy to install.
B000CO788G|5|fits well. with a little diy you can get the job done.
B00IBIPSBY|5|Great!!  Works well!!
B000C81PJK|5|👍
B001DC7L42|4|Have used the &#34;green light changer&#34; brand before and it seemed to work better than this model. It fell off somewhere on my journey and needed to replace it so I ordered the &#34;traffic light changer&#34;. Its hard to tell if its working or not, still some stubborn left turn arrows in my area it won't change but I think its worked on a few others. Regardless, for the money its well worth keeping on your motorcycle &#34;just in case&#34; !!
B00DQJ8G6C|2|Looked GREAT, but FM performance was SEVERELY lacking!  I just bought the 13&#34; and works 10x's better!  Don't waste your money if you want FM radio to work.
B00QZN8FR6|5|Awsome patches
B003177NP4|5|easy fit and takes about 15 min to put into the exhaust. Suppresses the sounds to a level where i can go in longer rides without headaches.
B00DQJB7EK|1|WEEK 2 PAINT COAT FADED OFF.
B002UXT3NU|5|small multi use strong carry with have in pocket when needed.
B000A6Z9CS|5|maintain performance and fuel economy.
B004O844EM|5|Worked perfectly for the desired intent.  Gave us more luggage capacity without worry.
B00K9ZZXYY|5|Love these higher step stool/seats! So many uses! These are perfect on the deck or for an RV as an extra chair table, a seat, a plant stand, and of course a step stool! I purchased one for my mother's caregiver so that she might 'sit' and not have to bend over... to help my mother with her socks and shoes. Lightweight and easy to fold up an store.
B009XRQWM6|5|These are the most vibrant decal dragon eyes I have seen. They look so good on my car. I got the big 8 inch decals and the detail is great!!!!  Also they are thick and good quality.
B00KC3D66A|5|what I expected
B00MFVSJQO|5|Very good mats, fit nice, solid.
B00498ALQC|3|No problems with belt. It fits as designed.
B001I9JKEY|5|Perfect. Fit,good quality , easy installation !
B002X6VXL4|5|My car has an issue with the battery being drained (security system error or faulty fuse/circuit). I couldn't survive without this Jumper/Starter, works great and really gets me through the year while my mechanic figures out what the problem with my car is exactly.
B00W4IDIGE|1|Followed directions. 3 weeks later, the adhesive was stuck to my car, no the ez lip...bought 3m automotive molding tape...lasted 4 weeks, same thing. Finally bought super strength auto liquid adhesive, and same thing... no adhesive sticks to the ez lip pro. I have the ez side skirts (not pro) and they are still on from the initial application. My car looks a bit uneven with side skirts and no front lip...and even worse when you really look and see all the left over adhesive...
B005H12SZ2|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 GMC Sierra
B000HDE434|5|Speedy delivery. Worked perfect for my oversized bearings and seals.
B000BGHSNK|5|Fixed my problem!
B003TTRORQ|5|For expensive rims no one makes a better product. Everything I have tested stains my wheels. DIABLO WORKS FAST and delivers a great clean wheel without the eye burning effects ts of store bought wheel cleaners.this stuff is great.
B005PSPD22|5|exactly what I needed -- fast shipping
B000KQ4F7S|5|Fits my Nissan Titan SE King Cab extremely well.  Avoid the stick on weather guards.  This keeps the rain out and the truck smelling neutral by letting it breath all day/night long in any weather.
B009AZ57O0|4|Fairly easy to assemble and install. The instructions are confusing, though. Took me about 45 minutes the first time. If you use a hex drill bit you can speed up the process. Carried my sea kayaks with no issues. Really like the nylon pouch that you tuck the extra tie down strap in to. It keeps them from blowing around and making noise.
B009DJXXXA|5|Easy to install,fits well on my Toyota Corolla 03. Arrived on time.
B00HPRFKKQ|4|Works as advertised good construction I recommend this part.
B00DSS9MD2|1|The struts do not stay on the bottom ball provided with the struts. Upon closing the hatch, they pop off and plunge through the top of the tailights. I had to cut the strut to get the hatch open and now have two broken taillights. What a costly mess.  I am now searching for a different brand of strut and two taillights. T
B010TSBXBM|4|I purchased kit to remove Harrison R4 compressor clutch.  My compressor had metric threads on the shaft where the puller screws in, the kit comes with ASE thread for the R4,  I assumed the kit would contain both since it didn't specify metric/ASE.  Otherwise its a nice kit.
B000F3NFOU|5|Lowered 1 1/2 inches in the front and 2 inches in the back. Car looks great!
B00136OJZ2|5|Bright and using for projects.
B00L7O7I9O|3|Got mine today and people weren't lying about how much they smell. Smell really bad..looks legit I'll be putting them on after I air them out.
B00FFAX2A0|5|wiring was reel easy, puting the new fan  is easy too
B001QXRPUI|4|works just as expected
B00S67T6PO|5|It's really good<br />I wasnt sure at the beginning but after i replace it, it got HOT !
B005T88YAQ|5|I've been using the Powersonic PS, PSG and PSH series batteries for years, mostly for my camping solar setup. I use them for lighting, inflators, cell phone charging, a stereo, and other miscellaneous power needs, including the use of a 300 watt inverter. I noticed that I was having to replace some of the batteries way sooner than I expected, so I bought my first PG series battery. According to the Powersonic site, this series includes a &#34;thick plate design and efficient gas recombination that yield a design life expectancy of 10 years in standby mode.&#34;<br /><br />I've had this battery for 7 months at the time of this review and, so far so good. I wouldn't expect any problems this soon, but wanted to point out the different composition of this series battery versus the others. Any issues down the road will lead to an updated review.
B007T8OL9W|5|Bought this to replace my Fairlead on my SXS after changing out the winch wire with a Synthetic rope. If you want to make sure this fits your WINCH, measure the mounting bolts front the center of the hold to the other and if its 6 inches then this is what you need.<br /><br />I used this on my Can-AM Maverick XMR.
B00IO971FQ|4|Is ok
B001O0AIOS|5|Made a huge difference on visibility on our motorhome. Really light up the side of road and fill in the darkness located directly in front of high profile rigs. Pretty straight forward installation.
B005FUWWWY|5|Bright, white and easy install. Original lights do get very hot, almost immediately, so use caution.
B009D41M9C|1|Rusted to my tire valves and had to replace all sensors.
B006RUJ2D8|5|Does exactly what it should. I removed many old decals from my RV and this stuff really softens the adhesive after the vinyl has been removed. Its not a clean job as the softened adhesive is gooey and slicks to every thing. You cant't separate your fingers after 5 minutes. But it does make the job easier. I had a 30' 5th wheel with 10 year old decals and I was able to complete the job with one bottle of this remover.
B002SZXIT0|5|just what I needed for a great price
B00HQQ3RZG|4|I love them only one light didn't work I don't know why the light bulb keeps turn in on and off
B000BQSL5E|5|I used this strictly for cleaning ink off stamps for paper crafts.  It is an amazing product and I'll buy another for cleaning windows and mirrors.  It really does stay damp and ready to use in the plastic container it comes in.
B00F542DQU|1|The red LED not working 👎🏻
B005DUU1BK|5|🔰
B000CSW7LA|5|Great buy.
B001USF7TA|5|Easy to install, exactly what I needed. Nothing more needs saying.
B002XLHUQG|5|Best wheel chocks ever. I have tried them all. Spend the money.
B001JM1JSU|4|works great.
B00OGCUNE6|5|No problems. Works as expected.
B00A90F9UM|5|Installed on my 2013 GLK350. No brake dust, no squeals, great stoping power. Would buy for all my cars
B000LWMVVS|5|Love it
B002Z34VJ6|5|It's great, almost too precise on the fractionals, throws up some numbers which are pretty unheard of.  The case is good and included an extra battery.<br /><br />One issue I saw was that turns itself on pretty easily, even when inside the case..
B004Y01WAY|5|I replaced this along with the Standard Motor Products EGV263T EGR Valve as a single unit on my 1995 F150 about 6 months ago. So far it's been working fine and the price was right. There's really nothing else to be said.
B00Q5MGN2Q|5|Well made and functional.
B00S5ZXC7A|5|Great product
B000CN7B5C|2|Put these on a tj jeep with a zj tie rod, correct part number for the application, a snug fit but not sung enough, back of the boot does not stay on the lip of the tie rod ends so the grease goes right out, ending up on my brake rotor on the drivers side. Might fit other applications better, always like to upgrade where I can, I will be changing these out with OEM.
B0042U4YFQ|5|Love this mat.  Carrying case isn't very good but the mat is perfect.
B003YKXTSI|4|Shipment was fast and product was good.  Very helpful item.
B0002NIF70|5|Looks great on truck!
B004QQCEO4|5|as advertised
B001SF0H0O|1|This part was JUNK, the mount completely came apart after less than a thousand miles of driving. Buyer Beware!!!
B003COTFS4|1|First time I put the winch into freespool it locked up. Had to hook it too a tree and slam it in reverse to get it free. Will never buy another cable winch again. Overall a good product. The cable is what ruined it for me
B00DTO6G9S|5|Its awesome. Bright, Still working. Just got another one few days ago but the pattern doesn't match with the old one. Still worth it and the price also dropped by $10.
B00NOA5SBE|1|they burned after one day terrible
B00X60I2LA|5|I have 2 Kubota tractors I use for work.I put these on them and improved and personalized my P51 Flying tractors.lol I get lots of compliments.
B00FP0G5EK|4|great product
B005M1AVFQ|5|I bought a cheaper one on ebay and it did not work. this one is the real deal.
B004HYPO38|5|Easy install, looks great!
B00JQYNTT0|5|Bought this to keep food warm for a family reunion 4 hours away. It worked great and chicken was warm instead of cold.
B00ZCE2Z5W|4|Well worth the money. Easy install, and works  fine. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the adhesive strip could have better glue. I recommend this for anybody wanting to add a little flash for a little money. I put then aiming at the floor in my car driver and passenger. Looks awesome.
B005Z2A3A0|5|Perfect fit and good quality
B004KPQB90|4|Really good fitment
B00YPQYLLY|4|Yes work great
B00DBLIPQG|5|EXCELENTE
B00Y1HT2ZC|5|I bought these because my family members lost the original remotes to our 2007 Pontiac Torrent with remote start. The dealer was wanting to charge $80 a piece for each of these but I have bought many other keyless remotes on Amazon before. For the pros we have been using these for about 2-3 months now and I have not noticed anything different than the OEM Pontiac remotes. The instructions are very easy to follow and took me about 5 minutes for each remote and worked perfectly from many different distances right off the bat. So far I have not had any cons for this product and I have looked hard to try to find any.
B00PCRIQ16|5|Installed right away on scooter. After initial oil change, found plenty of black tailings attached to the plug-- exactly the kind of things you don't want circulating in the engine oil. This kit does exactly what its supposed to do and its obviously an inexpensive investment for long term performance. This kit shipped from the west coast to our house in 2 days. Very impressed by the product, price, and shipping time.
B0024EC74M|5|Works well.
B000NTDYYC|4|was surprised when i actually received a motorcraft product
B0006FLNB4|5|my 2nd pair of mirrors for my 2000 dodge dakota.  these are perfect. greay for towing my camper.  i do take them off when not in use, partly so no one steals them/partly be already got it ok by Michelle to come in late this morning.  see ya in a bit  :)cause they look a little dorky. but they're my favorite thing when towing.
B00IGZP2UE|5|I used this in my old 93 Subaru Legacy as Subaru now recommends using this in ALL Subarus.<br />Package has easy to follow instructions (remove 4.5 oz from radiator, shake container, add to radiator).<br />Product is OEM as described, however it can be found at the dealer for only two dollars, so skip paying the three fifty it lists it for here and just pick it up locally.
B00HRZG9H4|5|It fits nice and tight. Easy to install. It hasn't rained so I not sure about keeping water out but I guess will have to wait till winter. But so far, great!
B000E28C68|5|Great product. I really like K&N products. Top Quality.
B0048E9PM8|5|I HAD TO SEND THE ONE BACK BECAUSE IT DIDN'T FIT. I FINALLY PURCHASED ONE FROM THE DEALER.
B00EY8A7CK|5|Works great fits perfectly fast shipping great price connector was a little tight but can't complain still fits great looks great<br /><br />I HAVE 2006 CBR 600RR WITH AFTER MARKET FAIRINGS  fits perfectly!!!!!!!
B000CPCBEG|5|Quality lubricant.  Worth the money.
B00DCM15GQ|5|great product
B00G6IJKLU|5|Worked exactly as intended, painted 4 car mats easy, gets the job done. 1 can = about 4 mats and then alittle paint left over.
B0016KBU3E|4|Great for our bike rack! Installation sounds easy but had some problems getting bolts thru hole on car frame.
B000BQ082S|5|NICE THANK
B008CFAFRS|5|Fit great
B000C34L32|3|These get three stars because they were missing the spacer that would have made them fit on my truck. The return was painless though. 1991 S10 2.5.
B00P05CJ54|5|Basic harness but works well.  I bought three at one time and would recommend this item.
B001VYO9JC|5|Got this cover for a 2013 F150 Crew Cab Short Bed. This cover fits great and was an excellent price. Although it has cutouts for the mirrors I fold them in when the cover is on. It has a couple of tie down points so you can secure the cover if you need to.
B00N2LKX2Y|1|plastic and not what I expected
B00XILK1RK|5|Very sticky and has lasted at least 2 months with no ware. Love it.
B008Y791O2|5|Will definitely buy again when needed. Great deal on factory product.
B000VKTUJG|5|A good filter, fairly easily replaced
B00BK86YCE|5|Came on time is was what was expected and is just a perfect addition to my truck
B00PGRGHKY|5|The OEM version just FITS so much better than aftermarket versions.
B00199IJE0|5|Very happy with order, and worked perfect, great quality.
B00133VP8O|5|This fits great on our 2014 2-door Wrangler Rubicon and it doesn't look bulky. It does add wind noise. Installation was simple, it fits all the existing holes on the Jeep. You can put back the soft top by removing the front bolts and leaning the rack back. Or in my case, when I'm not using it I just remove it. It's only four bolts and I rigged a ceiling mount bike rack in my garage to lift it off and on. I use the Thule Bars and Hullavators to put my kayaks on top of the Jeep.
B007OVRS76|5|Perfect fit. Great delete.
B0015S7UY0|5|Tried another brand and had to go back with Raybestos - smooth stopping, clean, and looking good.
B000BYEOIE|5|Top rate, work flawlessly.
B005JPJG92|5|All Lake Country products are good.
B004I0MOIY|5|I bought this item because I found it very expensive in my country -Saudi Arabia- and it work very good until now.
B000BYGFGI|5|Delivered on time. Better quality than the originals. Been 2 or 3 months and no problems. Be sure to replace them one at a time comparing lengths and taking note of position on distributor cap.
B004ME11FS|1|The taste from this hose is awful. I didn't rate it after the first trip we used it just to give it another shot, but the second trip was just as undrinkable as the first. I had to go buy another hose today. Too bad
B00WKZXXW0|5|Had to modify to make fit in a frame.
B00WAMPTOS|5|Great parts, great price, arrived early
B0041TQTZQ|4|Exactly what it is.....a side view mirror. Mine was broken, this one replaced it for a third of dealer cost. Installed in ten minutes. HELL YEAH!!!!
B00IV72IY0|5|Easy install on Honda Fit...
B008M4R4BY|5|Always spend a little more for a better quality part. Learned the hard way
B005OSHYCK|5|Fits my 09 nissan sentra perfect! Love the texture as well soft and comfy.
B007YATSQQ|5|it's all good
B003BM5LUI|5|Haven't had the chance to use this yet, but the quality seems great
B00QN89HSE|5|Prety good snd very nice good quality very happy.
B008052WV2|5|Excellent mats. Fit perfectly in 2012 VW GTI.
B00BG423YA|5|Put it on my integra and couldn't be happier, came with bolt and nut, easy to put on and looks great, feels like good quality, I've actually had it on my car for about 2 months now and it's not even dirty, not even on the white lettering, might clean off when I'm washing my car. I would recommend this to a friend.
B001FCBEA2|5|Easy to install and provides a convenient location to store your Guardian...
B00XRDAA66|5|Perfect fit & finish.
B00NBN1C78|3|I had the chance to try out this &#34;jack in a box&#34; and it is exactly what it says. It arrives in a cardboard box, inside is the metal container that you bolt to your trailer with the use of the U bolts included in the box, there's 2 different size U bolts so you pick the one that fits the best. The Jack is secured with a metal bar that you can put a lock on to keep anyone from walking off with it, additionally this bar holds on a rubber cap to keep water out. It's a pretty great design, but it falls short in one area. The lug nut wrench tool is supposed to open up into a 4 way tool, the one I received one of the arms would not lock into place no matter how hard I tried. Overall the quality of the container is good, the jack is good and easy to use, but the lug nut wrench itself, a pretty vital piece was sub-par and because of that I am knocking off a few stars.
B00D75V0OA|4|East to Install, cooler & Cleaner engine bay, smoother airflow for a lil bit more power. :)
B00FGR8Y4G|5|like others said they are a bit small but for scooters or my small copper works great and the mirrors are tight so when you hit a bump they do not move.
B00NJ3KYGU|5|um bright as hell perfect just what i need in the fields
B001C6Q7US|2|Noisy,  but it works
B0013JDW34|5|I wanted these for my R1...already have them in my Mustang. Great in inclement weather.
B00KTHXN1M|5|My husband did the programming so I'm not sure how that went,  but the remote is working great and it has a really long range. I love it.
B001B7BUAU|2|good
B0031IDI5C|5|On time. Exact fit for my car.
B008ESIODA|5|Great very quick delivery of my part. Dealer would have cost me 3 times this price. So glad I checked on Amazon !<br />Installed easily within 10 minutes. Thanks
B00GSAUHB8|5|Was unsure if I should purchase this at first. I needed a new sunshade to replace my old accordion one. My main concern was the time it took took remove and store the sunshade. It takes likes 10 seconds at the most. It keeps my car nice and cool and it's easy to store. Love this!
B000CRDMS8|5|great product for gl1500
B0053N4BUY|5|Perfect for adjust rear camber in Honda CRV. Original Honda setup don't have adjustments in rear camber and this can make a early tire wear.<br />Easy and quick mounting. Beautiful glossy blue finished.
B00GHSKXM4|1|Much than OEM which is $25 EACH but this is complete garbage! Breaks with the slightest pressure when connecting the bulb socket. DO NOT BUY!
B002S9UYM0|1|I had 3 of them, and they work great -- until they break! The clip breaks very easily! After using it 10 or 20 times, maybe 30 times they just break.
B00FQTG0JK|5|It fits perfectly and makes a huge difference!
B00OH0S5Y2|5|Great quality. Super bright
B002XEKDBW|4|Hard to really give good reviews. This is a mirror for a car. Granddaughter hit a pole, knocked her mirror off, this replaces the broken one. I guess it installed easily enough. Wires matched.
B0055PD1H4|5|Arrived within 3 days. It turned my faded plastic black again. I'm very satisfied. I highly recommend this product and seller.
B00CAKILAO|5|Perfect for Chevrolet
B00HK4G3ZU|5|My boyfriend loves this sticker and put it on his truck as soon as I gave it to him.  It just needs the words &#34;I believe&#34; below it.
B0001EVU9U|5|Received Auto Ventshade 25558 Bugflector II Hood Shield in excellent condition a couple of days prior to estimated delivery date.  It fits on my vehicle hood perfectly.  Had no problems installing it.  This was a good purchase and I'm very satisfied with it.
B005DUMZMS|1|Very soft, worn out in 3000 miles.
B000COTT1U|4|I purchased these from Advance Autoparts because the air springs in my 2002 Town Car were completely done. So far they are doing well and nothing feels different about my ride quality, which I was worried about after reading reviews after people converted their cars over. They were easy to install, especially for someone who knows nothing about cars but can follow instructions and Youtube videos. I also had the benefit of a bored neighbor ,who is a mechanic, watching me from his yard giving me tips on sly the entire time. I'll probably update this review in a few months with more input.
B00197TOUU|5|Bought the bodykit over a year ago, i like it. Attention from everyone, including law enforcement. But its definitely one of a kind.
B00LE7ZV1Q|1|Terrible...
B00NSF4IJ8|4|Just mounted this on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.... it's a beauty! I love the look of this light bar and would totally purchase it again in a heart beat. It's pretty heavy though, so make sure that you have purchased mounts that can support a little weight.
B00GBW09G6|5|good fit
B00KTJ6D26|5|Purchased this to replace a fob that broke. Once replacing the guts, it's works perfectly.
B005JU5Z74|5|Had no problems in a roaring down pour. I mean complete torrential rains with no issues at all. No streaking and I drive fast, very fast and these stayed glued to my windshield. Worth every penny.
B00JB69438|4|These will save you a lot of time and money. The wiring is a tad on the small side but it worked fine to wire up a medium sided light bar. Everything seems to be put together pretty well. I will purchase again.
B00BG8O68M|5|fits perfect installs in 30-40 minutes.
B006B2V35W|5|Bought this a week ago for my 2014 Stryker. I was on the fence between getting this or getting a Vance and Hines full exhaust. I was concerned that this one wouldn't sound good or be loud enough. After putting it on, I couldn't be any happier. The installation was super easy. It looks really sharp. And it sounds awesome. The YouTube walk around videos don't do it justice. It has a nice deep rumble and sounds good when you get on it. A+
B004W985DY|5|These on my car look great.
B009V1EKFU|4|Good quality. No tie downs on it though
B00K6X5HT0|5|Great product easy to use, works as designed.
B000KZUTCY|5|Easy to use. Structurally as advertised. Cured quicker than advertised.
B0010DXYHW|5|Fit well
B00QMWQQBW|5|I don't know why I got these for 5$ (after shipping) because I'd argue they're easily worth at least 7-8 times that.<br />Only complaint is the location of the rubber for the driver's feet - in my 1986 Caprice Classic I find my heel is no where near it. Looks cool though.
B00B5ZYY38|5|Easy to assemble and look great!
B00LQHR9GE|5|Excellent costumer service. And good led bar quality.<br />Thank you
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Great product ... Soft tags silk trim is nice so it don't scratch the surface ! Fast shipping ... Great product ... Will buy products from them again
B00IO9CB5Q|1|Nothing but rust and screeching 1week into use...don't buy
B00EYNF0WW|4|bought for truck so it was tight fit but perfect
B001PVQUWA|5|These are very nice and fit the car well. I love how they look and they keep the rain and snow out of the car.
B00651CLCS|4|Shipping was fast, and installation was easy. Haven't had long enough for comments regarding quality but so far no problems.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|Great blank for the beach.  What I expected for the price and quality.  Easy to clean and pick up, fold up and go.
B004A6I566|5|Great value and delivered fast.  Exact fit and less than any other vendor !
B000H0QRLY|4|Worked great for a light for our speed boat when were out on the water. Not super bright but allowed us to navigate when it was getting dark to get back to camp. Has a good light beam and flood pattern. Was perfect to be able to plug into our cigarette lighter and have a spot on our speed boat to  return back to our house boat. We also used it several times to see around camp at night. Could be brighter though. Especially with led technology on the rise.
B00U0AA5FU|3|they work
B009DJVXCS|5|looks awesome
B00XHQ8BQ4|5|Really love you my trash tray
B0031XFGV6|2|Did not work for my newer frig.
B00WID0OEE|5|R1EMPNMFLH1GTZ
B0013TM0Z0|1|Wish i could give it no stars. Bought it to &#34;HELP&#34; warm my jeep.  I have a hard top and the heater works like an old jeep heater does. I used weather striping to make jeep air tight. Then bought this heater to &#34;HELP&#34;. What a joke!!!! No help at all.
B00J8QKZSO|5|Keeping the car clean...
B0045N2A3I|4|This cover is very easy to use! I am not the tallest person in the world ( I stand at about 5 foot) and I can use it without any help at all. The material seems very durable and I am sure it will hold up through the upcoming winter months.
B00NGOM1IG|5|This has been great so far. A new heated mirror from a VW dealership was $189. I have a 2013 volkwagen Touareg. It does fit other years since these models haven't changed.
B000BZAERI|5|Perfect replacement part for my needs  Holding up so far.
B00KULIE9I|4|Fit my ford escape with out any issues. However they do generate some brake dust.
B0093XZFPA|4|AA++
B001F0IE7A|5|Worked great
B0022WPLZ8|5|This is my second set of these pipes. Absolutely love the sound on my 2005 Yamaha Road Star. The first set developed a crack in the center of the lower shield after 20,000 miles. They never developed any bluing. I'd buy them again.
B00I9SK8WK|5|I used this to coat a 1 inch cylindrical neodymium magnet. I put about 8 coats on the magnet, and let it dry enough to not deform from touching it. Then I wrapped it tight with electrical tape and let it stick to a chunk of steel on both flat sides. I left it like that for a day or two. When I unwrapped the tape it was a dense coating. It really protects the magnet, but it does of course reduce the strength as well.<br /><br />Anyway, if you need something coated in a soft layer of rubbery plastic, this is the product for you.<br /><br />Oh, you can also color this clear plasti-dip to any color you want. Dye not included. I left mine clear.
B000YOH16I|5|Awesome product. Used to change tires on my 25ft camper, worked great!!  Small enough to store in camper in case of emergency tire change. Very well built, highly recommend.
B00VGL86SU|4|Just what I was looking for, great!
B007ZDGMA2|5|This order was on prime day so it was discounted. So I tried it. Boom I was blown away my car leather looks brand new. I am so amazed. Totally recommend this product and will definitely order again plus try some of the other products.
B00BI8P9BI|5|Prefect
B004BCFXP0|5|great product, fit awesome!
B00Q8PAM4A|5|Great for some extra storage in my Chevy Volt.  Be sure you have a carpeted area to stick it too.
B000XQJZ3E|5|Was gonna get the 14 because I wasn't sure this would be enough. It's perfect though. I love it.
B000MW91RE|5|Works as intended, used on the headlights on my truck.
B011RZ1IA2|5|First I have too say I am happy to review this product. I purchased my 2006 Solstice from a dealer and they didn't have the remote. The dealership was asking $154  for the remote and programming. With the savings on this fob I save $85 . The programming was done without any problems. Thanks Keyless2go.<br />I will be getting a second immediately
B00LWQ5F06|5|Put it in today in my Moms Optima 2008 model! Perfect fit, right color! Local KIA dealer wanted $130 for each one, $5 to install them! I ordered the passenger side as well, of course the factory one broke as well. So for the price of one dealer you can buy both! Original Kia replacement part, only thing is the air bag warnings are in Korean but who cares about that! These sun visor's should have been a recall safety issue in the U.S. anyway, I am happy that my Mother can drive safe again!
B00JGJH8QU|5|Great item, BUT CHECK THE LIGHTS!!! I got into the unfortunate bad habit of just using this as a surge protector and not checking the lights for proper circuitry as soon as I plug it in. So two days ago when I first plugged it in I just plugged  my power right into it and went about my business.30 minutes later I could smell burning plastic and I found one of the power prongs completely smoked but it did save my rather expensive trailer power cord. The best part was that the campground owner wrote me a check for the replacement cost of this unit! Among search protectors this unit is probably the most economical but it is worth every penny!
B003LNJWTI|1|WORST HEADLIGHTS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT ! ! ! ! Now I know why they were so cheap,they are absolute junk,the generic lights I got at Walmart are way brighter than this junk,put the old bulbs back in...Now I'm going to go get some Slyvania BrightStar Ultra lights,they cost almost 4 times what this junk did,but I know they'll preform as advertised....
B000B8N3MS|5|Worked well to stop a p0455 code in a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse.<br />Location for tether was well marked and easily drilled.
B00R587N4G|3|No instructions what so ever, I know its a decal, but at least instructions. Do you peal from the front or the back???
B005OV8M28|5|Exact replacement for Saturn Astra.
B004GD9OVS|5|perfect fit for my 04 armada.
B000V1XQZ4|5|excellent and fast would recommned
B0002U2V1Y|4|worked well, but detailer product left a bit of haze behind when used with claybar.  I found claybar and clean soapy water worked better and resulted in cleaner, clearer surface.  I will use the detailer separately for touching up after waxing.
B007JYNLGU|5|Look and works great.
B000COTKDM|4|should work for what I need
B001UROUJO|5|Great value.
B00WINFLEM|2|When I went to take the passenger side panel off to add the relays and connector (as stated by the manufacturer), the connector was already in use for the passenger side mirror, window and locks. Therefore, this relay assembly cannot be used unless there is another identical unused connection somewhere else that I am missing. That being said, the running lights from the wiring connector did not work and without the relays, I will probably have additional turn signal problems in the future.
B004QPCLC0|5|Fit my daughter's 2006 Camry perfectly. Don't need to disassemble the rear deck to snap on the post retaining rings. Just break off the old grills, cut off the posts flush, push the post stubs down the mounting holes with a screwdriver, put a dab of adhesive on the new grill posts and push them in, with a brick on them until the adhesive dries. About 10 minute total!
B000ET6ZNS|5|Works well, no problems.<br /><br />Only issue is, for use on motorcycles, its long (standard) length makes it a liitle awkward to use with disc brakes
B001M1A0XI|5|purchased this January 18, 2013 after I got my bike its been through rained,, carried by top, and sprayed at the car wash, and has held up through it all, just be sure to test fit and make adjustment with the visor open and plan around vents you may need to cut it some.
B00OUM8GLY|5|Love it! Our Seattle summer has been crazy hot.  We love how easy it is to store the sun shade because we know grey skies are just around the corner. The sunshade will be easy to store all winter long.
B001AI57UE|5|I am 190 and ride solo, and 2 up at just under 400.<br />I was a bit concerned that this may be too heavy for my solo riding because the manufacturer recommends for 250 and up.<br />however on the loosest setting it rides fine on my Sportster xl883c. Have not ridden 2 up yet, but expect it to be a vast improvement over the stock springs.
B00CTLI6D6|1|junk cheep, rusted inside, leaks,  low quality trash, took off car and threw away was so upset,  don't waste your time with this one  junk junk junk
B00SAIX0EC|5|Took a bit to get here (from Korea) but works great.  I have a Ford Escape and it installed easily.  Keeps my purse from falling into the back, frees up the passenger seat and also is a deterrent to the dogs jumping up front.  I'd buy one again and recommend the purchase.
B000C2YAOS|5|Used this on my 2006 Corolla to replace stock tensioner pulley, was concerned at first when I tightened the bolt down, the pulley wouldn't turn by hand. But I still proceeded to install it and the engine/serpentine belt had no issues turning it. So far so good
B008E32NJ6|5|Works great for my expedition!!! Price is a great value!!!
B00F4BGVSA|5|I was a little concerned because of the price but parts were as advertised.  There are no instructions so you need to know what you are doing.
B002R8HMAY|5|Works perfectly on a 2008 Subaru Impreza 2.5i 5-Door 5MT.
B00M1X6F9Y|5|Package was on time and built great for the price
B0096R0JK4|4|No regrets with this purchase. I've ridden in below freezing conditions for two hours straight and didn't get cold toes.
B009YEYN6A|5|Havent used it but im happy with the product
B000VNHN5G|5|Bought this a couple years ago. Way too big for my garage but won't hesitate to run my 3/4 and 1&#34; impacts. Any air tool I want to run I can.
B00HVHW4PE|5|very nice quality and fits nicely
B00496Z394|5|Fit my 2000 Honda Civic EX just like OEM.  Easy to install.  Hardest part of the whole process was getting the back seat out.  Recommend looking at youtube videos if you haven't done it before.
B000SL0R9K|5|Nice small size for the trunk
B00COYNZJ8|5|GREAT PRODUCT QUICK SHIPPING
B00X6DDVL8|4|This sun shade is so cute but it is a little small for my Prius windshield. I guess the Prius has a pretty tall windshield bc of the shape of the car. I tried propping it up using the sun visors but it kept falling down. I had to give it to my husband to use in his SUV which has a shorter windshield. The little sun shades that come with it are wonderful.
B000CQI23Y|5|Best thing ever if you are hooking up to side terminal batteries. Giges you that extra terminal you need. I have them on both my trucks battery.
B00NK6K4U2|1|Terrible quality
B000CPAVI4|5|Extremely nice product. Came well packaged and did just what I needed it to. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Would suggest to all.
B0055DP5AW|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B002R61V7Q|5|Works well as a check valve for diesel line
B00ID7EDRI|5|no trouble installing it. but the instruction needs revising. it has the picture of 2015 highlander but the year listed on the paper indicates different. just confusing for some.
B001IF2BDU|3|need to be a little wider
B00002243Y|5|great product
B00189BJI4|5|Great upgrade from a regular Windjammer to this &#34;wrap-around&#34; great overall product no leaks protects from all the elements. Also it keeps warm air in or cold air depending where you from.
B004P5G2GM|5|Great fit!
B008KT30CI|5|Husband hooked this onto his motorbike as soon as it arrived.  It works great. He's been on 2 mountain rides and used it both times.
B001F1B95S|5|worked great held air for years. pinched line once jacking up- be careful of routing lines
B000WEPI4M|5|It does not fit in a small car but for any other vehicle it is fine.
B00E5PK8TE|5|Excellent product
B001810SHA|5|Arrived on time and work great.
B00PX6DY18|5|Took a lil minute to put on but looks and feels great
B007XUHHFQ|5|Its working. Hope it will last.
B00F87YQ32|5|Great product. We have two.  Black and Camo.  Last me so long.  Had to buy another one for my husbands after three years, felt it was time for a new one.  We put it on the back, and put our coolers in the middle compartment.
B005TJY0Y4|5|Best product for its money
B00QXU3LRU|5|Exactly what we needed.
B000BQR8TE|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00CFY1VEI|5|I received the flag in good condition, and it looks good on my UTV!
B007GRERK4|5|Product is great. Customer service not so much 1 star
B0027QWNGO|5|I have bought 3 of these handy trash bags. It is super inexpensive yet quite well constructed.
B000HKVDKE|5|They look great and easy to install!
B001UJB8C4|5|Bought this with the Thrush 24224 Glass pack for my 12 Ram 1500, it worked like a charm and made up for the lack of length the glass pack had.  Pipe coming from the engine slipped in one side, and the other side slipped into the glass pack.  It's Flowmaster, so it's excellent quality.
B000BQLVKG|5|Used these to tie a cooler down on a motorcycle tag trailer. Worked very well.
B0009V1WSE|1|Pins too short, doesn't go through the entire hitch.
B00CKINFQQ|5|It was perfect.  Delivery, condition, fit,  price. .. Everything great.
B009HHH4WE|5|It feels great under my elbow duing those hot summer day.  It comes off and on easy.  I wish I could have gotten a grayish color to match my interior.
B003FAEOIQ|4|Not quite as good as the wiper blades that came on my 2013 RAV4 from the factory, but they were phenomenal so I'm still very pleased with these replacements. They are economical and easy to install and I like just replacing the rubber blades themselves so as not to waste the rest of the wiper asm which is still perfectly good.
B0042OIYX0|5|Great Customer Service from Reflective Concepts!! Car looks great with the hood spears on it and they are good quality !
B008YEXV4Q|4|Worked, I didn't like the flimsy filters that it came with but I'm installing an inline filter anyway. Did take away from my reserve capacity a bit though.
B004PC4DCA|1|Arrived with the chrome all nicked up. Return went good, and the design was good. Would have liked them
B00EOBIT7M|5|Works as advertised. Highly satisfied.
B000BXHWCA|4|Does this stuff clean well?  You bet it does.<br />Will this stuff also devour plastic parts?  You bet it will.<br /><br />I'm being very fair in this review.  I used this to spray off my RC car after a fun afternoon of racing around a dirt track and it got the car very clean.....it also completely dissolved the plastic parts on my electronic speed controller.  I'm not blaming the cleaner, it was totally my fault for not reading the can carefully before using it, but I have seen other reviews that say this is completely safe for use on RC cars and other things with lots of plastic bits and that just isn't true.  I'm sure those reviewers had very good luck with this cleaner (after all, there were some plastic parts on my car that this stuff did not damage at all), but I think it was just that--luck. There are lots of different types of plastic, and I guess I was just unlucky and found one of the types of plastics that this CRC cleaner finds very tasty.  The plastic that is used on the body shell also does not react well to this cleaner--it becomes VERY brittle and breaks like egg shell after coming in contact with this cleaner.  My servos and basically every other plastic part on the car appears to be unaffected by this cleaner.<br />If you plan to use this on your RC car (or any plastic-heavy application) I suggest using with caution.  Heck, to be honest I suggest against using this product.  CRC makes another electrical cleaner that they say is plastic safe, I would suggest using that one instead.<br /><br />For the bits and pieces this stuff doesn't eat, it cleans very well.  It dries quickly and doesn't leave any sort of residue behind.  Even though my review may come across as a bit negative, this stuff really does a good job as long as you understand what it's capable of.  I did remove 1 star because they could have mentioned something on the can about the possible danger to plastic.
B00JM208IG|5|works as it should and an easy install.
B007WMFEFA|5|Working
B00HDMEUCW|5|Really happy with this. We bought another for our second car.
B000CNB2UC|5|The fit and finish of this product is perfect. I haven't installed my transmission yet at the time of writing this, but I can tell you that the bushings fit the original steel mount casing and the steel sleeve fits perfectly in the cross member.
B00DTEARQQ|1|&#34;Most&#34; kits come with blinkers. Except for the one they mailed me, which is for the bike in the title. Buyer beware.
B000FQ0DA6|3|did the job
B00Y1HSLHC|5|Came with simple directions and works as it should
B004OXM0FW|5|Great part
B00NPKDGEE|3|Everything installed as expected, and fits fine.  After about a month, mine has started to turn yellow and it looks like there are small cracks everywhere on it.  It still opens the latch fine and feels much sturdier than the original one the car came with.
B0012WYI58|5|Very easy to install. Monroe struts are quality.
B00S50JIBO|1|Horrible quality. These are painted, rigid plastic covers.  They are not made of aluminum as the description states.  The plastic tabs easily break when trying to put on the covers.  These are useless.
B00CMC5DII|3|Expected the product to work easier than it did. But, its good nevertheless.
B000C9OSQG|5|Increase of 3PSI fuel pressure on my 94 gmc 6.5l suburban.
B00M0443ZW|1|Installed in a 2013 Optima SX - Worked great for (1) month - just long enough not have a warranty.<br />Plastic round lens fell off both bulbs - what a shame
B001U2DPUE|2|Made no difference in reception. Save your money.
B0013RGR2Y|5|probably blocks about 50% of sunlight.  Takes a bit of work to get it installed as you have to stuff 3 buckles between the speaker housing and roll cage.  Once it is on it makes driving in the sunlight much less harsh.
B000C2WFA4|5|Perfect fit for my '05 Infinity G35.
B003YLIGNK|5|Had an issue with this product a few months after I bought it, returned it for a refund without hassle, Yvonne was a pleasure to deal with. I will purchase Dorman parts in the future.
B009ELOCSW|5|Nice bright bulb replacement for both our 2008 Subaru Forester and our 2002 Lexus GS300 Sport Design. This bulb is both a Tail Light and Brake Light bulb depending on the vehicle.
B001HX9WVM|5|Great
B00GHT8TSI|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B0082OU772|5|Beautiful!
B0049OKZDA|5|Awesome after market fox for my 2007 chevy impala! For real
B00B62PAK6|5|I am on my second switch which the seller gave me for free and it works well.
B00IGZQGAY|4|passenger mats all fit great, drivers mat is slightly off by the gas lever release
B00BTHNEDI|4|Worked well
B0024MW424|5|No problem with black color , thank you
B0068C2ASE|5|It works. Simple to install, seems like it will hold up.
B003CG9QFY|5|Very nice
B00H6XPZN6|4|Easy to use and to remove when lowering the window.  Only preference is that they were a bit larger
B002G1UO8E|5|good product
B0000AZ8JB|4|came as ordered, adjustment parts under the flex hose are plastic, worried about that. Works so far, it does pop off if you keep adjusting it a lot though.
B000QQXAFK|5|Great quality , easy install Made USA
B00HJ1592C|5|The product matched the picture and description and totally met my expectations.
B00XO9CZ8O|5|Easy to install, looks good
B005SIC5CK|5|Looks great on the front of my car.
B007TYR1U2|5|Worked perfectly to replace a broken one on my Dodge Ram's tailgate & the price was great!!!
B000C7VY8I|5|Fits like a ring in a finger
B00371X7EA|1|WAY TOO SMALL, WASTE OF MONEY, MORE FOR TEENS
B00N99TZ1O|5|Works great
B000VLF9NQ|5|Covers the Jeep when the top and doors are off, or when the bikini top is on.  Also fits over a Rampage top, but will not fit over a factory top while raised.  Its a bit bulky, but possible for one person to throw it over the top and have it all lashed down in under 5 minutes, which is faster than you can zip in the windows on most Wranglers.
B000JFHNG0|5|Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars to get this one.
B002XYRQT4|5|great item
B0073XMXMK|4|Great stubby antenna! I like that it's not bendy like the MINI version.
B003V57NUQ|5|Worked great for our kayaks.  Would recommend for anyone.
B0022SHR6I|5|Very good sunglasses for the price. Used them quite a bit already and they worked very well
B00D8TWSTQ|5|Because the red lettering is so small, it forces people to get pretty close to see it's not a Hillary campaign sticker.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works great
B006M4603O|5|Great battery.  I use mine to power my GPS/FF on my kayak.  Lasts all day with no problems.
B0075SCD28|4|Very cute
B00HNTXKG2|5|says it all
B0068SYSP6|5|what I expected
B008TMCSSS|5|Thanks so much!!
B000SXCLIS|4|Fit well, actually the lenth/ size they said it was.<br />Good material.<br />Only manufacturer I found that covers 9 ft...length.
B003HB2AFM|2|should not have rated this as I returned it. wrong size
B00LOZSDYA|4|these were good just smaller than the original equipment but they worked well thanks
B00ZTS45VS|5|fast delivery and works great..good price
B0075M6X7U|5|Awesome sticker that can only be found here. The teeth are kinda small and have a tendency to come off after a while. But it really looks good.
B005EA1I9I|5|fue exente
B000GD5FMY|5|For the price – these are amazing. They fit me really well, (Usually glasses are too big for me) and offer great wind protection.
B00OWK4E3I|5|Works as stated. Nice and big for large drying jobs!
B006X8COIE|5|love it fit perfect thank u lol
B00I8OFIDO|5|ok
B0009IQYZ8|2|Don't have the patience to do a whole car with this. It is so small that I would probably do more damage than fixing any paint flaws. Used rubbing compound with a orbital buffer and that worked fine and save me a lot of frustration.<br />I am not saying the product is bad be I don't have the personality to make use of this product.
B004DRPFNI|5|I love the way my truck looks.. It looks 7 yrs newer.  Great product.
B009DJPVQ2|5|perfect fit, fast shipping
B00X01J9A8|5|Very good fit! Locking cable too short though. I would buy again.
B007IKOX7Q|4|Nice little boost of power, better than stock!
B00HSCN67M|4|The gun works perfectly.
B00666HTB0|4|Less dust than original pads
B010PSKDFI|5|[[VIDEOID:efa9f6701798176ca9474a0dba50b232]] Aukey did a really great job in this nicely packaged car jump starter kit.

B00E4Z7QVI|1|They said these covers would fit the seats in the Jeep I have & they did not. They slide around bad when you get in and out of the vehicle & there was nothing to attach them too. My husband is a mechanic & he couldn't even figure out how to get them to stay on. Cheaply made.
B005OVJVWI|4|The base of the antenna is generic and the upper portion fit my 1999 Buick Riviera perfectly.  A little modification  of the base was required<br />according to the individual who installed the antenna.  So far the equipment runs as if it were the original antenna. Very pleased with the<br />purchase. Would recommend the product for a Buick Riviera (1997,1998 1999). The local Buick dealer says the part would also work on<br />most GM cars from l987 thru 2001. I don't know if that  information is reliable.
B00122EEK2|5|Great part. It fit in perfectly. Good replacement for the downswind O2 sensor on my 04 Honda Accord lx. Would recommend.
B00HF40N06|5|Used this in our parts washer at work. Effective, low odor. Just what we were hoping for
B00UPRWI5I|1|They do LOOK good once you get them on, but the nuts and spacers don't fit properly. The holes aren't drilled correctly to fit adequately mounted on the truck so that the brackets fit flat on the truck without crooked parts. That and the fact that there is no middle support makes the design seem unstable and I would not trust it for long term use. The nuts provided are all coarse thread while the stud on the truck that they mount on is 10 x 1.25 fine thread. I had to use my own spacers in order for the front bracket to fit securely on the truck's mount and the back brackets would not fit flat. I finally got the driver side on and the passenger side wouldn't line up properly to fit. I finally took off everything and plan to spend more money on a better set.
B005345ULW|5|This is exactly what it says it is only better then the photo and I love it and have just ordered more and would definitely recommend this seller and product
B0022XEDOW|5|Product as described; fast delivery!!
B00SK2BP90|4|fits like expected no problems<br />thank you.
B00ONHVACI|5|great item
B00IDI7TOG|5|Nice item
B00DBEO8Q4|4|ok
B00T36JATO|4|Not very sturdy
B000C16XPI|1|This item does not fit the Pontiac 1999 Firebird
B00B8SZWAQ|3|It was not the greatest purchase I made. We bought this for a mini cooper and it doesn't fit worth a Sh!t. Having a small car we were worried about this shade fitting in the window properly, although someone else said it fit well in their mini which was the reason we went with this one...I'm not sure what kind of mini they have or what &#34;fit well&#34; means but it doesn't fit well in ours, neither the side to side width not the top to bottom height. In a regular size car this might be good but bot for a small car. On the plus side it did look like it was made well.
B0002MB80C|5|I have used this for over six months and it's in great condition. It grips to the steering wheel great and looks very high quality.
B00JA80PEO|5|This is a great product. Had a little difficulty getting the speakers positioned inside my helmet so they didn't press on my ears, but once I got that figured out am very happy with it. Recently road from Pennsylvania to Virginia Beach including many highway miles and steamed music and used iPhone navigation the entire way.  The clarity of the music is great.  Good bass, which surprised me. This is a great option for a great price.  Planning on outfitting my wife's helmet soon with her own.  UPDATE:  Finally installed the second one into my wife's helmet.  No problems at all with installation.  Full face helmet, where mine is a full face flip-up style.  Had no problem syncing the 2 units together.  Now the great news is we each can be synced to our separate i phones listening to music and still use intercom to talk!  great product!!!!
B000CRVFYQ|1|Did not use but is good
B000B68V6I|5|Stabil is a great product, and a great price delivered to my home
B00RCT3F7C|4|For the price, it was worth it.
B009KVRVNE|1|Fell apart after 2 days, avoid this product, the rubber hoop that the ring goes through is very thin and will break, I nearly lost my key in a drain because of this key ring.
B007T413MY|5|Was exactly a described, less that other sellers, and arrived on time. Thanks
B004D2XMEW|5|Looks great on my 2010 Chevy Camaro.
B00WGYARIS|5|Pros:<br />Great Brightness level vs OEM<br />Color - Bright even distrusted diamond white with a small hit of blue. Colors match most LED daytime running lights on cars today.<br />Easy to install in a H11 socket<br />Images of what these look like installed are attached<br /><br />Cons:<br />None so far for myself. The LED housing is much bigger then halogen bulbs so these may not work in all cars.<br /><br />Installed:<br />2015 CRV the install could not have been easier.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Buy these if you want the HID look without the use of ballasts<br /><br />Install Tips:<br />A simple test is to disconnect your headlight wire, turn your lights on and see if your daytime running lights are still on. If they are on, your probably good, if not, you would need a canceler cable.
B00N2ZFN7U|3|Takes 1 1/2 gals of gas before the needle moves on my John Deere 300
B00DT082BW|3|Fit and finish is great.  First time for me. Will know how good they are after about 6 months,
B002UCYS0Y|5|Best cloths to use to clean your plastic motorcycle windshield. Hand washable in a pinch on a long road trip.
B00PG2T38M|4|Smaller than I thought, but I like it.
B00RW4KF1G|1|I put them on. They don't fit properly. They don't cover the back side of the rear windows that opens when you let the windows down and within a few days of having them on, they sagged from the heat under a carport.
B0037ZAJ88|3|Jury is till out on this product.
B000CPASBY|5|these work great and look good.
B008CFVOBO|5|I love these patches. It allows me to show my pride for working in the oilfield. I will be purchasing more patches from StickerPirate in the future.  The patches are good quality, the edges aren't frayed, like you see on cheaper products, and they aren't too big to put just about any where you want. They've got a new customer, not just music, but my whole family. Each of them has foubd plenty of products they offer that they &#34;just HAVE to have&#34;. So, it looks like we will be buying a lot of patches in the future. Because the variety that they carry I haven't been able to find in stores. Even at the mall.
B004SFRW0E|1|Crap product
B008I7NNLA|5|took 2 minutes to replace work out great
B001TI5IIQ|5|This product will work as well as the more expensive options, everything you need is included.  BUT, I did not like the tiny sanding papers provided and used a 2000 grit wet sponge instead for the material removal phase.  This will make that part of the job much more palatable, I assure you.  I then used the polishing compound in the kit with my porter cable random orbit polisher.  Cleaned everything up carefully and applied the two wet naps that came included to seal the headlight.  I pretty much purchased this kit for this last step, it is critical to seal the headlight away from nasty UV rays or the yellowing will just come right back.  I did two cars at one time and the headlights look new again.  One word of advice I can give is that if you cannot store the car in a garage for the 24 hours after applying the protective coating, you will need to make sure there is no rain in the forecast.  The sealing compounds took all of the stated 24 hours to dry.  I expect the headlights to look great for years to come, I'm glad I did so for very few dollars, new headlights for my vehicle run $250 for the pair.
B003M9J2OG|5|Fit perfectly and came in perfect condition.
B005O01SDE|5|Fit was perfect.
B007QBRSLK|1|Was led to believe this would fit my Dad's 2000 Lincoln town  car. But it didn't so I had to return it
B003WKHMBA|5|Great!
B00A0T9K16|5|Excelente
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Love it and it fit great!
B00A0OTPFC|4|Good.
B00P43TNGU|5|came fully charged and works fine
B0046V4TWY|5|Awsome product power, gas mileage and the sound is on point
B00YLZ7C3S|1|This is garbage and NOT in anyway tied into anything Jessica Alba.  This is by some junky comapany named 9moons.  It doesn't look like this picture at all.  Very cheap and smells funny.  I ordered one and contacted Amazon for a replacement thinking it was just an error, nope got the same thing again.  Also waisted over an hour to get a refund and ask them to get someone to investigate the site
B00TU3U9Y0|5|A handy extension that is durable.
B00EIIH6PC|5|excellent...
B00L3P6Q8G|5|Grill was as described
B000KL74EO|5|Nice looking mats that fit snugly in the drivers and passenger sides of my wife's 2007 Ford Freestyle. The material, even though its rigid and formed, has a soft feel surface. This is nicer than I expected. One small drawback is that some sand can embed itself in the surface which is difficult to vacuum out but can be washed off fairly easily if you want to take the time. One other plus is that while debris does get behind the floor protectors, it is less than I expected. Very pleased with this purchase that I would recommend.
B0000AXRH5|5|perfect for pouring into a small fireplace
B00H9AYKI2|5|I'm sick and tired of breaking rubber stalked turn signals just from bumping into them while walking next to my motorcycle . These are solid aluminum and work perfectly for my application.  Shipping was fast also, I  would definitely recommend these to others looking for something more durable.
B000CAINDE|5|Great price. I bought 2 and they fit both my Toyota Tacoma truck and Chevy Astro van.
B0018YIKK4|5|Boingy boingy boingy
B00HRMSNPI|3|I LOVE the white light!!! However, the fitmit in the back tailgate isn't tight so it makes a rattling noise over bumps..
B00SARBMWU|1|They go bad two week last this are my third I buy
B00OC0ID76|5|Super cute and smells great.  I've had mine in for close to 3 wks now and it still has a little scent to it.
B0058J4XX8|5|Amazing ... I surprised my hubby with them... he put them in his 97 Mitsubishi Eclipse fits very nice and looks really pretty in the dark !!! Best ever
B000BYGJUA|5|Quick ship and low price on a high quality spark plug.
B004D0FEMM|1|This is a (WAY OVERPRICED) way to make a connection . If you plan to be hooking up a temporary electrical connection I guess it serves as a reusable crimp. does not make a good permanent solution though. And its made very cheaply VERY small and threads will strip easily if you try to tighten to much. Also the end caps you screw on to tighten the wires down are EXTREMELY small and easy to lose. And if you lose one of the caps the connector becomes USELESS and for a buck or more a piece that can become a real expensive problem....SAVE  your money these are way too expensive and M/O a bad choice for an electrical connection.
B00GBOQPS0|5|Great product
B00HRXQOI0|5|The mats are awesome!!,
B00SC1054K|5|This was quick to program, following the included instructions, and is working perfectly as a replacement.  It is even better than our original which I would sometimes trigger the panic alarm accidentily when carrying the keys in my pocket.
B001V8U12M|5|these things are amazing :) a must for any RVer!
B0091UL9UA|4|They fit perfectly on my 2010 Nissan Xterra and were not hard to install at all.
B009PQ6TM8|1|A locking mechanism is missing on the side farthest to the air filter system. Wrong specifications, saying it would fit and match my vehicle's year and model.
B004OZCG90|5|Power probe is the best thanks
B00EXJQYK4|5|Worked great in my 05 Scion XB!  Really liked it.  Only thing I might change, use locktight or some other product to ensure the set screws don't work their way out.  If you don't want to, I had allen wrench handy and would occasionally tighten them.  Really liked design, feel, and really sets of the shifter in any manual transmission vehicle.  One knock, it said blue, in light it was more blueish green
B00UA0KDZ2|5|Perfect fit!
B009WK6XN2|5|I love it. It is firm and fits my neck as a 5'1&#34;  130lb female. It holds the weight of my helmet and handles the wobbly feeling I use to have without it. I have a 3 level fusion in my neck and love the support and confidence.
B00KTJ2J9M|4|I think my fob works better than it did with the original cover. Time will tell if the icons hold up or wear off soon.
B0094HVMGQ|5|Fit my 2014 Prius perfectly.
B00INVEQKI|5|Needed these for wiring buttons to an arcade stick and its great for it not too thin or fat just right for those sanwa buttons.
B008ET00ZO|5|Fast shipping and it works great with our 2012 C250. Highly recommend it
B000XJRYQ6|4|Shirley
B00JSJMV38|5|I have a 2015 Toyota Camry SE and this fits perfectly! I ordered a medium. I love the red stitches since it matches the black seats with red stitching! It's a great product! I am satisfied.
B00NB806B6|5|As promised
B00230QELE|5|great product fast shipping
B00KE68C0A|5|Worked perfectly.
B0094HIZXO|5|Good quality, installed in a breeze.
B00407NK6A|3|This one leaked, oh well.
B001JDE6ZW|4|At first, I really disliked the mirrors. They're a bit of work to install, and they initially seemed to serve little purpose because I didn't think they could be adjusted. Since I discovered that I can loosen the screw on the back of the mirror to adjust the position, I am much happier. If you bolt them in tight enough, there is minimal vibration, but they may damage the paint on the door hinges.
B00QSMWKDO|5|All great
B0086JI9VO|3|A little smaller than I thought it would but well built and easy to install
B002PQOEJK|5|Great Look... Now I need to get some new headlights....
B000E3CYIY|5|I love this wheel cover.  For summer when it's 100 degrees the wheel needs a cover so I can touch it!  It will also keep my hands warm in winter and what a great price!!
B000C5CEKC|5|fit perfectly, arrived as promised.
B00DUQKGIM|5|Perfect fit
B00SLYYTQ8|4|Nice quality. Prompt on time. I will recommand anyone<br />New complete and look beautifull. It was a good purchase and I will buy again if I need to. Tumbs up
B003VV3TYO|3|On the 3rd seats cover not so fit.
B0002NILL0|5|Owned one of these before.
B001KSA9UM|5|Direct fit, the gasket was a better fit than oem. Overall no issues and has worked great
B00CPYC9BC|4|Works well.
B0013REXO8|5|More 5 Stars for Rugged Ridge Euro guards.  They offer some protection, but if you want the look at an reasonable price, look no further.
B0078S1LHI|5|Just perfect
B00HE917KM|5|I have an automotive repair shop. These really save me a lot of time and money.
B00DWVN08I|5|Came quickly and fit perfectly into hitch. I think my car looks so much better with the cover on than it did before. :)
B004646QYK|5|i ordered two and they are both great. really keeps the car nice. Takes a couple of times to learn how to zip and unzip quickly
B00RAIK622|1|This sucks ass DO NOT BUY THIS! looks great but will not stick for s***. No stars for this
B007ZXXQQK|5|Makes the install of the stretch belt easier to install on a 2008 Subaru Impreza 2.5i 5-Door 5MT.
B000EVU8MK|4|It's good; makes my favor hobby very easy.
B004K9JU8A|5|Perfect fit, not too hard to put on with normal tools.  You will need some loctite but that can be found at any auto parts supply store or home center.  BE CAREFUL though, the two sets of shoulder bolts are not the same size between the reverse gate and the steering nozzzle - and watch the loctite on those shafts.  This causes the turning/reverse gate to not work smoothly if you get either incorrect.
B00NUPJBL6|3|The only issue with this helmet is the center bridge inside protrude and causing irritation and a rash from that pressure. Other than that, it fits good.
B00801RJJQ|5|Bought both left and right struts, and they both work great on my 2.2L 94 Camry.  Now my car doesn't bottom out anymore on speed bumps.  Just make sure your tools have enough torque to remove the two big nuts at the bottom.
B0000AYYU1|2|Not the right parts, this was for generation two alpha one, not 1986 generation
B000C7XVQG|1|This was not what i spect
B004HDY90I|4|Good deal
B00HQONDE8|5|this product, work excelent
B001FCAXT0|1|I bought this by mistake because of the poor labeling and the tiny little picture.  Not sure why they can't put 6 volt system in the title instead of one entry half-way down the page.  My mistake, I guess, but this supplier sure doesn't make life easy.
B005FL28YU|5|Only issue was the rear caliper spring that rubs on the rotor hub. Really annoying. Just used the old one (was in good shape still and all is well. After 20 miles of city driving, the noise has reduced greatly but you can still hear the typical drilled/slotted noise under braking. Its not bad at all though. Braking so far is great. Be sure you have a place to get to easily with no/minimal braking until ready to break in and seat the pads per instructions. Five aggressive deceleration from 40 to 10, five moderate deceleration from 35 to 10. Both sets without coming to a complete stop. Then 5 minutes or more of driving around without braking to allow brakes to cool and the resin in the pads to setup.
B00CFQWGG8|5|Fit and works good
B00EB8FP5W|5|I had a mechanic install it for me and it took no time at all.
B0049IFX56|5|Had to play with tach to get correct setting for myself but now works great. Will use tack to be sure prop is correct for my boat and later hr. Meter for service intervals. Only shows tack or hrs. Not both at same time. I slipped my wire inside a small diameter hose to keep from shorting out against motor.
B000VSY4HG|5|Better than I thought.  This item works perfectly in my 2+5/16 ball hitch.  The enclosed pin locks work perfectly as well.  When all used, this thing would be a beast to steal!  Just need a cable lock for the wheels...
B000H0KMEC|4|Work well as expected! I like it!
B00CDSOVVG|5|Thx
B00CFBV8FI|5|Fit 2003 Grand Caravan.  Made all the noises disappear.  I can't believe I waited so long to do it.<br />I used to be embarrassed to stop at the red light, I would turn off the AC and the noise would be reduced.<br />Now there is no noise at all. I can't believe it.  If you are wondering if you should do this kit, take it from<br />me you won't be disappointed.
B005ZF45X8|5|great product
B000ARPVNY|5|Worked great stopped the ticking at start up.
B004HLSHQW|3|The width of this particular ramp is too narrow for a large dog.  I have a great dane, he wont walk up it, its too narrow.  It seems like its fairly well made, and certainly works with my truck.. just wont work for my large breed Dane..
B00QNRBVUC|5|Very cute.
B001OMT4GO|5|very good product
B00VZF38NK|5|Affordable quality alternative to the dealers cutthroat prices.
B00FVZC0XO|4|Great product....didn't come with shifter shaft bushing...made one easily though
B000C843NA|5|Worked great
B00OJMD4NK|4|Sizing is off! But great helmet !!!
B002OP3V0U|2|would not fit
B000C462KQ|5|excellent.... Deliver on time it worked perfect great seller I will buy from this seller again.  Happy customer
B001MXTOKQ|1|save your money poorly made and does a poor job  would not buy again
B004CNR8F6|5|I have had two different Computer UPS units fail because of the battery.  Purchased a set of jumper cables, but the clips would not make a good enough electrical connection to power the UPS from a deep cycle boat battery.  Took a chance, bought these and now the UPS works like a champ.  In fact  as I am writing this review, there is a thunder storm and the power has blipped 4 times from 2 seconds to 20 seconds, but the computer never new it.
B00NB8W0FQ|5|These are probably the best lights I have ever bought. I will be buying led headlight bulbs from opt7. Thank you
B00P3XQPAS|5|Bought for Fiat 500L. Improved intake sound. Easy to install with long Phillips screwdriver. Best filter.
B003CEFJ2A|5|Great product!
B007KPR5QA|5|should have had one years ago. great.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Beautiful and super easy to install!!! Would highly recommend
B008Y3O060|5|Works great !
B00D0DMIX6|1|This product did not work for me. The spoiler did not fit properly and the space for the wiper washer spray is on the wrong side. I can't even donate it to anyone.
B000BYERBI|5|good
B00E0OHZDW|5|Unit is packaged well to survive shipping.  Carton was damaged when received, so I expected a damaged product.  However, the packaging absorbed all the abuse and the condenser was in fine shape! The unit is shipped with all ports sealed and under a slight vacuum so there's no path for contamination.  Installation was easy (I watched APDTY's video on YouTube first) and everything mated up just like the OEM part. I also replaced dryer and expansion valve as recommended.  System has been operating for over a month now with ice cold A/C and no leaks.  Great value!
B00032KBFE|1|The screws were way too big was unable to use it
B008KKPJOO|5|It was great ...came in timely manor and quality is good
B001TWD5GY|1|The wiring harness is a joke. Nothing worked even though I followed Hella's extremely poor written instructions to a &#34;T.&#34; I saw a YouTube video where the guy used a different wiring harness from O'Reilly Auto. I will try that. I knew I shouldn't have skimped and instead bought the KCs like on my last Wrangler.
B00ENCQ7YO|4|I have them for over one year now. They lasted out well so far. Not very bright in sunlight.
B000CCDN1Y|5|nice quality item. fast shipping. installation was a breeze.
B0012PNSO2|5|Great shocks, great price, we'll see how the car handles when I finally get all the repairs made but right now. 5 stars
B000E2CVIS|5|I have been using K&N filters for a while now, and they have never given me any problems.  The nut on the end makes them easy to get off.
B00E9HWS9G|5|This is just what we needed.  It was a little big but was able to trim it down with regular kitchen scissors.
B00XULVDHK|5|Works great and super easy!  We have not even needed the suction cups.
B00MDH0W1U|5|Cute complement for my other truck decor
B00VKSUKYW|5|Work perfectly on my 06 Chrysler TC.
B0000CBJ3Y|5|Perfect where accurate dispensing is critical.
B000BGM89Y|5|The 4-pneumatic wheels make this tank stand out from the others, as well as the side discharge.  The drainage hose provided with this Barker tank is probably the lowest grade hose you can get - ours sprung a leak the first time we used it.  We had a previous tank that was 2-wheels top discharge and it was difficult to move around and drain.  Spend a little more to get this Barker tank, it will be worth it!<br /><br />I would highly recommend purchasing a Rhino hose that has the bayonet fittings (we purchased on amazon). This makes draining much easier and you won't have to worry about your hose exploding all over you!
B00BLX1L4O|5|looks great was worried about it being a stick on but has worked great through winter and now the heat of summer recommend it
B007Y1H0D8|2|The adhesive strip from the sand paper came off from being in my work bag, but it was easily repaired with some super glue.
B00332GPMY|4|These are made very well, thick, dark tinted plastic and not flimsy like some other vents you'll find. I was very happy with these on my '06 Scion xB for about a month, until this morning when the passenger side blew off on the highway on the way to work :( I did everything as the instructions stated, cleaned the channels thoroughly, rolled windows up and down 5 times, then left windows up for 3 days!<br /><br />Any way to buy just a passenger side front replacement vent without having to get a whole new kit? Driver's side keeps sliding out of the channel now too. Kinda bummed, really liked how they looked and functioned. My advice is if you get them maybe put on your own adhesive. I've read the double sided 3M automotive tape you can get in the store bonds better than what comes on these.<br /><br />**UPDATE** Returned the original set I bought and Amazon sent me new ones, the new set fit perfectly. The original set were almost an inch too long on the part that tucks in by the rear view mirrors. The new set are great, if during the test fit they won't fit don't force them they may be too long and will break!
B00KL3ALGO|4|This sticks well to my windows, even after I accidentally rolled the window down with it in place. It is also very easy to reposition. The shade is made of a mesh fabric that I wish was a little more light-blocking. However, my husband likes that this is easier to see through than the more opaque suction-cup shades.
B00AMLQ7KE|4|These are great steps.  I knew to switch the rear brackets from reading other reviews so that was a big help.  Took me about 2 hours to complete the install, did so without a lift or a jack.  It was very simple, hardest part is just aligning the screws.  I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor installation instructions and the rear brackets needing to be swapped.
B005HBBZEM|2|Agree with reviews below.  The instructions included are the worst.  I am having to purchase my second meter because the first was ruined
B000RNW5MG|5|Easy install on a 2014 Wrangler Rubicon
B0067PUMXW|5|They look awesome
B0026CG5S6|2|Front windows roll back down when they get to the top where ventshades attach.
B000TWI4DO|5|Great deal for the factory product
B0010GI2KS|5|great filter-good price
B00I1K555Q|5|Good material.  Headband is thick enough to keep its shape. Enough tail to stay tied and tucked in.  Absorbs sweat well.
B00FQHZYFI|5|Works great and fits perfectly (535D).
B000B8GAPK|5|Good neighborhood but not gas thief proof until now.  Have a 2003 (like new) Jeep Grand Cherokee and never a gas thief until now. With the high price of fuel it's easier for some people to simply steal then work for it. This gas cap is real deterrent as the cap is definitely secure and I won't have to worry anymore unless they use a crowbar.
B000E176LQ|1|This shield sticks out to the sides too far and if you take your truck thru an automatic car wash, the brushes will break the ends.<br />I do not recommend this shield.
B00T8OB5NK|5|Fits perfectly without errors in my 2015 GLK250. Quick delivery and simple plug and play installation. Couldn't be happier!
B00LTU1QYO|4|handy for fishing
B00EKTI8TM|5|Looks great!
B00VNJ4N46|5|I give it a four nice, look and radio sounds great.
B001AGT39M|5|Direct fit for my Subaru Outback
B000GKB0FI|5|love it!!!!
B0101KXCAI|5|A+++
B00CNZRQHA|1|Very difficult to apply with many steps and frustrating to transfer image smoothly. Bought this one and one from another company on the same day and the other was easy and smooth. This one was frustrating, difficult and then looks bumpy, and non-adherent. Finished project looks like I let a child do that one. (even after much time and effort). Would never use this brand again.
B00FBKRQTM|5|A++++++
B000E9Z49Y|5|Some of the best window cleaner around. Safe to use on cell phones and TV/monitors too (spray some onto a towel or microfiber towel in that case though).
B00D5O28Y4|2|Not what I expected
B000GKAZ7C|2|Units were very old. Battery lasted only a month or so.
B0013ERRT4|1|needed more parts, returned it

B009F3FALC|5|Great nob with a great look. I have a short shift adapter installed, and due to this, lost some of the leverage in my shift linkage, making it a little more difficult to go between gears. This knob, weighing in at 440 grams, which is a half ounce shy of a full pound, gave me the weight needed, to counter the loss of leverage. My car slides between the gears like butter now. This knob threads straight on in place of the factory knob, no adapters or cheap hardware to make it fit.
B000CE9ERO|5|I love it , perfect
B004KMYXFM|5|These are a very comfortable chairs...We bought two for our camper and had to run people out of them all the time...
B00FF7BRVY|1|CR2032 battery fits 2004-2008 Prius key fob. The CR1632 battery fits the 2009-Current Prius fob.
B00CB3E50U|4|fast and good quality
B00P2QAAG6|3|Seems a little small.  Wish I had gotten something bigger.
B0054KWONM|5|Quick. Quick. Quick. Oh and it still works
B00ANQ68QQ|5|Great stuff. Just like oringial
B000H8U37K|5|This is a complete plug and play replacement for your Grand Cherokee tail light. Bulbs, sockets, housing, and screws are all included. It feels like good quality and worked like a charm.
B001NKGN2U|5|Awesoem Awesome Awesome<br />I recommend the 90 watt version of this product. It keeps me nice and toasty in cold weather. Very comfortable and the variable temp control is great .<br />If you like riding year round, this can't be beat.
B00H36XX6C|5|The Noco XGrid battery pack is a very useful little device.  Having spent the better part of the last month on the road, I would say that a battery pack is something you do not want to be without when you are travelling... at least not if you are someone who relies on mobile electronics.  I have several battery packs which range in size and weight and relative utility.  The NOCO XGrid is very light for the power it packs, and with a very bright (250 lumen) flashlight, more useful than most.  It is coated to make it water and dust resistant  and relatively impervious to drops.  The lithium ion battery charges fast, holds a charge for a long time and has double the cycle life of nicad batteries.<br /><br />The Noco recharges via  usb and can be recharged from a computer with the included cable, or with a usb wall charger, or colar panel (with  an adaptor).  It recharges many small electronics: cell phones, cameras, tblets nd laptops (though some may reqquire additional cables, if they do nt use mini usb).  In general using the oem cable is the safest way to charge any device, insuring that it is getting the correct current and not overcharging.<br /><br />It is on the expe3nsive side for a bettery pack.  The reason I rated it 5 stars is that it is lighter weight than most of this capacity, shielded from the elements so that you do not need to coddle it, and has a powerful flashlight, making it useful in it's own right, and meaning that you do not need to use your tablet or cellphone as a flashlight, running down the batteries or exposing it to elements you otherwise would not want to (rain...).<br /><br />It is the perfect accessory for camping or day hikes (which may turn into evening hikes).  It is a flashlight which is bright enough to keep you safe walking by the side of the road (we use ours walking the dog at night) and is small and light enough to keep in a purse or briefcase so you always have a flashlight and emergency charger close st hand.  I is one of hte more useful little tools I have come across in a while.<br /><br />The NOCO comes with a one year warranty.  Service within that year is free with a receipt, or 45% of MSRP without.  Amazon stores your purchases, so if purchased here, you will have that receipt on hand.<br /><br />It is a well made, light weight, rugged and portable battery pack.  If you do not already have at least one, Iwould recommend it.  It's something I personally find indispensable.  I like that the NOCO gives you two useful tools in one lightweight package.  It costs a bit more than comparable battery packs, but is also a bit more useful and a lot more rugged than most.  I like htings I do not have to qworry about too much or coddle.  This is a useful tool that doesn't occupy a lot of space or add a lot of weight, and one I do not need to worry about.more useful little tools I have come across in a while.<br /><br />The NOCO comes with a one year warranty.

B00ZR4324K|5|Shipped fast, easy install. Exactly the way they look in the pic. Love them!
B000CFH4IE|5|Went on easy..... nice rumble a bit on the loud side especially when I a lost a baffle on my first ride... waiting on a response for a replacement.. take your time and tighten the set screws to prevent a baffle loss!
B0023VF8YM|4|Didn't fit very well.
B000PCC9ZM|3|I bought this to replace the wheel lock key that got lost, unfortunately this set's key was millimeters too big to fit mine. The key for this set did NOT fit my 2006 Mini Cooper S with OEM wheel locks. I ended up having to go to a wheel shop and have them take off my old set and replace them with this set. So not a complete waste of money.
B00FAVW8PY|5|Great product. Solid. Easy to install, just need a wrench. The stock bars felt too low for me, I'm 6' tall and felt like I was reaching. This 2 inches made a big difference, much more natural position now. Throttle cables are a little tight now, I might reroute. All in all, awesome.
B004969RCI|5|Great
B0041C9D5Q|5|Pretty darn good.  They aren't the quickest to heat up, nor are they the hottest grips out there, but they work.  When it was -17F, they got up passed room temperature after about 3 or 4 miles, but if I let my hands off the grips, they chilled back down pretty quickly.  I also never got to see them soften up all the way.  They were rock hard when I installed them (just at the beginning of winter) and started to soften up in the spring, but I totaled the bike before they had a chance to work through a whole summer.  The grip texture was fine, and the size was great for anyone with medium to large hands.  Installation was super simple, and the fit and finish for everything was superb.  I used them on a 2002 Kawasaki Mean Streak and loved them.
B000L9P63Q|5|great product
B00MJFOVR2|5|The bolts work great however I believe the instructions are incorrect.  The large tab should be turned in the direction you would like to move the camber.  Other than that they work perfectly.
B000BO9TMU|4|good size - sturdy
B00651BYGM|2|The quality of my radio signal was drastically reduced. Driving North or South have much better reception than East and West. Returning this and back to the stock antenna until I find something else.
B00O72R7Z8|5|I started with a little issue but this issue got addressed right away excellent service product is better than I expected works great I recommend it 100%
B00OP81LL0|5|Love it!
B00D4522AY|5|As advertised, trusted seller AAAAA,
B001D5FZCO|5|I purchased this air filter to replace the one in my Nissan Altima. Everything was the identical filter as the OEM air filter that came with the car. They wanted 36.95 at the auto shop for this filter. So glad I purchased it online. I recommend this filter and will continue to buy my parts online.
B00DCMM8US|5|This pad worked great. It did an awesome job getting some pretty gnarly scratches out of my paint. I was positive that I would have to get my car buffed out by a professional detailer, but using a clay bar and this pad with this [[ASIN:B002654I46 PORTER-CABLE 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher]], I was able to make my car really shine.
B0076OVRGO|5|This six-pack is the way to go if any of your WJ Jeep Grand Cherokee lift supports are wearing out.  At this price, replace all of them.  Lift Supports Depot is an excellent seller.  Strong Arm lift supports are great quality and surprisingly strong.  These are not difficult to install...it took me a few minutes.  Installation requires two Torx bits (T30 & T40) and someone or something to hold up the hood and lift gate during change out. Lift Supports Depot has a instructional video detailing installation process.
B0000AY1W7|5|I use it on my Motoport Kevlar motorcycle suit.  It reflects UV and repels water.  Reflecting the UV makes the suit cooler and prevents color fading, which is a problem with Kevlar fabrics used in the sun.  Stands up to several washings before it has to be re-applied.
B00F60TRLW|1|This made my bullseye worse. I followed the instructions. When I removed the contraption off my windshield it pulled chunks of glass off the bullseye making it larger and the liquid adhesive (which should've hardened) ran down my windshield. I ended up using 5-minute epoxy to fill the large hole.
B00MJ89VOM|1|Scratches all over vinyl. Does not stick well. Tried to use small pieces to add some design. Can't imagine trying to actually wrap a car in this stuff.
B00LNE40OY|1|not compatible with our RV blinker system, works alternately, and does not light for running lights.  Reversed polarity, and does not work that way at all.
B00KZCM0RE|5|Fast shipping nice product
B00VVUSRQM|1|Nope..the left one fit but the right one is lil bit too big
B004VXJFG2|5|good quality product...very useful
B00MQA7JMY|5|Boyfriend loves it.
B004323RS8|2|Cheap, kinks and threaded metal parts are difficult to grasp making it difficult to screw on and off.
B000BRCKTG|4|Perfect fit for my Onan 5000.
B000A8OW9M|5|Very good price and convenient shipping.  Arrived as expected.
B00MBFBRT0|5|Looks good
B007VUD53Q|4|Product did what it is suppose to do, I dropped my car the 3 inchs, but wish there where instructions, you have to really look at you have to work With and figure it out but once you look at it it's pretty explanatory and once you got one the rest will be easy ... Over all Ride at all 3 inches drop is pretty rough when you hit a pothole and they feel sometimes pretty bouncy but for the price it's bearable and was money well spent. At 2 inches drop the ride was a bit better tbh.<br /><br />Also rims are different color in the picture because I also painted the rims the same day I was doing the struts, since they were off already I thought It was good time to paint them gun metal grey.
B00068OR8M|5|perfect
B00E3VFP20|5|works as expected. thanks.
B00PAMUACQ|5|Love my seat belt covers
B005NLQAHS|5|I was a little skeptical to buy this because of all the reviewer who say it didn't work.  I took a chance and it worked great in my 1999 Toyota Sienna.  Synced right up to my LG G3 via bluetooth and transmitted info into the free Torque app.  Only problem is that the instructions say it's supposed to be disconnected when the car is off or it may drain the battery.  I also I have to manually connect it via Bluetooth to my phone each time I restart the engine.  Can't get it to auto connect for some reason.  I use it to keep an eye on how my car is performing on long road trips because it has over 200,000 miles.
B004137VKO|5|Easy installation and it works great!
B00U9YOXJ6|4|Went on easy, and looks good. Decided against putting the moon roof visor on due to the fact that it is over sized, and just doesn't appeal to the way I want my ride to look. Can't beat it for the price. These went on a '94 Honda Accord, 4 Door Sedan.
B008BLFHS0|5|Works great, a bit difficult to use if you're not used to applying this kind of stuff. Does leave a sticky, tacky residue when removed but does come off with some work. But overall, great product. For a really yellow look, apply 2 layers.
B007G7PWSA|5|Using it in a 2004 VW Passat GLX 2.8L V6 and in 2012 VW CC 2.0T
B002Q1H2PW|5|Did exactly what I wanted and was easy to install.
B005G66A7A|1|Does not fully fit my tail gate
B000C9OFQE|5|Hardware and instructions included.  Not expecting that.  A moderately difficult installation but not due to the part.  End result successful and as this was a favor for a friend, he was quite pleased to have a functioning driver's side window on his 2002 Z28 convertible with only 22,000 miles.
B008HTARNQ|5|Good plastic dip
B00400D6WU|5|Very easy installation  couldn't have ask for easer direction
B00SAAW8Y8|4|This worked really well on a Jeep Cherokee roof mounted 30&#34; LED light bar. I had to extend the two wires that ran to the light but otherwise it worked out OK. The wires are a little on the thin side and the way the wires run into the top of thee switch is a little funky, but it has been used about every other day for the last few months and it seems to be working fine. Hard to beat this deal, I actually ordered a couple more of these kits since it makes wiring lights SO much easier and faster. There were no instructions but basically everything is already set up for you. I will continue to purchase these.
B004OJZDAK|5|Work very good.
B001GC2LVM|5|Super easy to use
B001FCB4JS|5|Pefect for all my RV needs
B002YI72TS|5|Very good product. I would recommend it highly.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Excellent!
B004W97UMG|5|Easy swap with OEM lights.
B00OSSPONI|5|Awesome
B00OJXDZI8|4|The fuel door is identical to the stock fuel door found on some models of the JK/JKU. The only reasons I can't give it 5 stars are that it didn't come with instructions (found an online video), and the hole where the fuel cap should be snapped in is too small. Other than that, I'm very happy with the look.
B00BMU98AK|3|These won't stay on and were a waste of money
B003CXHOSI|5|Fits well on the Saturn Sky
B0052FRHX6|5|worked out great, thanks!
B00HEV2SK8|5|Great product.
B0000AY9HO|5|Well worth the price.  If you're like me I have many trailers of different sizes to work with.  Changing balls is much easier than switching recievers like I used to not to mention the storage of them.  I've used the tri ball hitches and they are heavy and bulky.  This is the way to go for sure.
B00QKLFFWG|5|This was easy to put on and the quality is fantastic. I save myself $150 to do it my self and I did it in about 1 hour. I will alway use CURT
B000PDIBF8|2|I purchased this to use with my 2 stroke Yamaha and it does not fit at all :-( My fault. But if you're buying it for a Yamaha 2-stroke it will not fit. The fitting is way to large. So I'll take a trip to the local boat store and pay $10.00 ++ for the correct fitting to use next time.
B00G93DA6I|5|Awesome, easy to install. Rear view mirror may be in the way so you might have to cut a notch out of the windshield to accommodate.
B00GAVTRDE|1|The worst product ever, i bought 3 sets and non of them worked properly, my advance not wast your money.
B002QGVWBW|5|Batter received was not the one pictured but if they last I don't have a problem with it. The Battery I received does not say &#34;rechargeable&#34; on it but looks like all the other rechargeable batteries we have purchased. Will let you know if they don't last the one year as promised. They were received within the time frame estimated. All came fully charged which was very helpful.
B00BNYATOE|4|Cool
B0053IDUF6|1|head of light does not fit into opening for standard bulb.  Returned
B00BGH1XH0|5|My husband loves these so I bought a pair.
B007FMJHQY|2|Installed in early 2015 on my wife's 2011 Nissan Quest van and used for approximately 7,000-miles.  Pads come in a pretty box and with seemingly good hardware. During my use of the brake-pads, the initial stop (above 45mph) was fine, but subsequent stopping after warm-up resulted in vibration through brake pedal and steering wheel.  Also, length of stops increased dramatically after repeated stops.  Since we lived in an urban area and the van is typically subjected to this type of environment; I decided it was a safety issue and replaced with a different set of new brake pads (Bosch QuietCast). There was evidence on the rotors of friction material being transferred from the Raybestos pads.  I removed most of this material with an emery cloth and then cleaned the rotor with brake cleaner.  I then installed the new Bosch pads.  After pad 'bedding', the van is back to stopping like it originally did with the factory pads (made by Akebono).  I am very satisfied with the Bosch pads and have used their QuietCast products on my 2007 WRX with similar pleasing performance.  I will purchase Bosch pads again (made in Mexico) and will avoid the Raybestos brake pads (made in India) in the future.  I hope this review will help assist your purchase/maintenance for brake components for the safety of you and your family.
B00IVZZRKO|3|I tried it out 4 days past the allowed return date, only to find find that it didn't work. It was D.O.A.  To bad, it looked good and was at a good price, if only it had worked. This was Not a Fault of the Seller, just a bad unit. NOTE- IT Says DC 3-30volt  12//24V Green. What voltage range is it?
B000E2ARGG|4|Fit my Honda Rancher 350 just as it should
B009GKY4IO|1|It was the right product, but the fan control only worked at the highest speed.
B003QU3HW4|5|nice size, easy to hose clean, easy to fold and store.
B00XL70YKA|5|Great product
B007ZLL3YY|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B00KQWI3JC|5|A+++
B005Q88PGW|5|This was very simple to connect onto our 2007 Acura MDX.  Works great.
B0030GF2NQ|5|Great Product!!It helped my wife a lot while she was learning driving.
B00HS0GKVI|5|arrived promtly and fit exactly on my 2000 rx-300.
B00C5RBRA8|3|Excellent product!
B000RGXLG2|4|Serve it's purpose
B002SE1EN8|5|Great addition to my car! Easy Peasey!
B0035GS7WE|5|Can't get a sleaker look than these!
B007IO81NY|4|Nice looking cap.  A little small for my head, but I generally take a pretty big hat.
B004ZF4930|5|I like the headlight so far... It work good and very bright... I receive it on the time... It was easy to install...I definitely recommend it...
B00WW7CR0A|2|It came very fast but putting it on the wall is very hard and time consuming. When I put it on the wall it started lifting the paint , and it also came out very sloppy
B001TPUCKI|5|excelent
B00UYMRNOU|5|VERY BRIGHT & WORKING WELL SO FAR.
B00UG2QYSY|5|nice
B004U002J0|1|This is no custom  fit, in order for the mat to fi5 flush the second row seats have to be move to the front and the space for the passagers to pass by is only about 5 inches.Don't  buy this ,and if you do don't pay more than $10.00 more will be a rip off
B001AVSIOI|4|Very sturdy.  The lock can be a little tricky at an angle and the key can be a little sticky but some WD40 sprayed in occasionally helps.  Overall not too bad
B005S0CQ4U|1|ONLY one of these tire stems stayed on!!!  They were put on properly by my mechanic.  So how do you return something that you don't have???  These were a total waste of my money!!!
B00GICB5KS|4|The product fit well and the color matched perfectly.
B0002JMF98|5|perfect
B000ALN7U4|5|Very nice little key chain. It's exactly what I wanted.
B004AIHKT2|5|better than stock
B00ZC6AX54|1|if you don't have a lid anywhere on the console this thing is useless
B00BXMRP4I|4|performed well and quieter than expected. manual loses a lot in translation -  many errors and very unclear.
B00DM8N7X4|5|Awesome part!
B00DJBQ1SW|5|light weight and foldable for easy storage
B0068O1SLM|5|Excellent ride quality. I have a 2011 Jeep Liberty with a 1.5&#34; lift(2.5&#34;) overall height. These shocks are 10 times better than stock.
B000BZGGV6|5|Worked perfectly, great price, and direct fit would definitely buy again.
B00R1X85Z6|5|Got what i want it
B00MIWM3QM|5|OEM Honda switch. Works great!
B000IZ1JNY|1|They did not fit my vehicle as described it would had to teturn them
B00V80P97U|5|Good quality switch. Slightly smaller than I anticipated, but seems to built very well. Only real complaint is the lack of a terminal diagram with it, but if you're electrically savy you shouldn't have any issues.
B001P2EHKG|5|The installation was fairly uncomplicated, though the directions were just a touch sparse. The nerf bars and parts were easily adjusted to make the attachment points properly.  I'd  do this again if I had to replace them or for a new truck. The bars look great!
B00I9FBX18|4|Omg the seller is a life saver this was one of my best buys the state I live in would fail my car if I didn't get this fix and I bought it at a good price and it came quickly too.
B000AM8C1W|5|Awesome product.
B000P6WMKK|5|Wicked torch, one of the best I have used to date.
B00G49DVGG|5|works good
B00A30VBJ6|5|I haven't used this yet, but when things get frosty, this snowman will help me find my tan sedan in a sea of sedans in a parking lot. Cute as the pic, and will look cool on my antenna. Third purchase from Jenna toppers. My first was a simple Angel. It worked well enough and did the job I wanted it to. So now I am living large and getting fancier toppers.
B00913D004|5|i love it
B0041MCLHS|5|perfect
B00A66GYDA|3|Good for the price paid.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Worked great
B000CQVNQW|5|These are great rotors... Working nicely with my Brembo Pads!
B002WBRRHE|5|Works great just wished there were instructions on it there were three other plugs that were the same
B00IVPA056|4|Fits good, nice quality
B00L3FNG34|5|Its cheper, its good! noso good like one of 25 dlls but it works fine to protect my tank of my suzuki
B0096EFVBO|5|Nice additional touch for my G50.
B00BTGSGFK|5|Great product easy to use, works as designed.
B0023UPORY|5|everything perfect
B00ZOR134Q|5|Product worked like a champ!!
B00BKNW6WQ|4|Works great
B00DMTTSIQ|4|Just received, excellent fit. Good value.
B00NF0KIOA|4|These work fine and put out a lot of LED lighting. Issue with most of these types of bulbs is that the LED PCA board (that lights attach to) are cut too long and hang out over the barrels on the actual assembly.  This causes issue with putting the bulb in the socket in many cases. Wish they'd stop doing that.  These were not as bad as some.
B00WOT3YM6|4|I like the fact that it is digital and stops at the pressure you want.  However the cord is too short to reach my rear tires of my long bed pickup with the DC hookup on the dash.
B006X8AIEG|5|This is an awesome set up. I will say though, if your charger is any color other than black or some other dark color your gonna need to paint the plastic behind the grill so it doesnt look janky. I have to remove mine and paint it lol! but it looks good and installed easy. had to remove the bumper but its no big deal if you have some power tools!
B000W9T5SW|5|Worked great in my hotel in Russia,its a bit heavy  so I may recommend posting the weight for those strapped for luggage penalties id say think of it as about another 10lbs to your luggage and the TSA will check your bag. But I didn't mind its a good converter
B005FM0RLK|5|Perfect fit, no issues
B00I0FP7EQ|5|This mat is perfect for us.  Our camper is 23' so it covered so much ground in front of it keeping lots of dirt out of the camper and it is so easy to sweep and get rid of dirt, dust, rocks and leaves.
B00C7CKNFG|5|Brass Spout extends up to 9 inches with shut off tip. Use the dispenser up side down, squirt fluid into tight spots.<br /><br />And that's why I needed to purchase this product.
B002U6I3BK|5|Good product and fast delivery
B00H5A7IP8|5|After a little work I spliced them into my hazard lights. They look great.
B004Y3V1QG|5|I had this slave cylinder on for close to a year now and its working great, no problems with it. I would buy it again if I have too
B00IO0QHM8|5|GREAT IDEA  AND EASY TO REPLACE.  WILL NEVER USE FILAMENT BULBS AGAIN..
B000GV95G8|5|Easy to install, very adjustable and I think they stay in place better than the Tour Tech versions because the inside of the clamp is rough, so it grips the bar better.
B00Y85UM7O|4|Do measure for your vehicle.  We got the right fit.  Ours fit a tiny bit tighter because we have rain guards on all car windows. We have a highlander and the smaller size worked for us. We can have the windows rolled all the way down so our large dog gets the air and our little dogs stay safe.  We just have to get them to stop jumping up on it so that the material doesn't tear.
B000B8I61G|2|This was an add on item that was packaged with books so it came broken - not necessarily the products fault, but it still is very flimsy and is only big enough for a can. There is no way that it would fit anything larger like my water bottle. I would look elsewhere - not worth the money.
B00QJ3W4YW|5|Fits perfect. Good looking radiator
B008YGL7K4|5|nice heavy piece at a good price
B001SGI7SM|5|Fixed the problem.
B006VFEJJQ|5|I'm the owner of a 2010 Prius II. After five years, my OEM 12V battery quit. . . it no longer was able to power the vehicle through the start-up sequence (once jumped, however, the car ran fine. . . it just needed a jump after I turned the car off). I was naturally worried that my problem was more than just a simple battery replacement (bad inverter, etc.). After purchasing this amazing Optima battery from Amazon and easily installing it in my Prius, all my problems went away! I web-searched some videos depicting the Prius battery replacement/install (http://goo.gl/OATVDs). I also brought my old battery to AutoZone, and they recycled it free of charge.<br />Thanks Amazon and Optima for helping my fix my vehicle!
B000EQ74AO|5|excellant price fast delivery
B000BNXRVK|5|wrked
B00QWBQ7DA|5|Good!
B00IPS3GMI|5|Good deal,delivered on time.
B000CMCNJC|5|USA made product. It fit and is still working after a month as it should for years.
B005F6GY6I|4|Delivered.
B00AB2IER8|5|Came within a few days after ordering, took about 20 minutes to install, looks like a factory install, Had the local Ford Place flash the computer and everything works just great.
B000C7TUNY|5|Great fit with my 2006 Sequoia.
B009FPRGLC|5|Good quality, fast delivery.
B00CIMABMU|1|Terrible. Bought it February already has rust
B00002NCB2|5|Works perfectly great purchase
B005NLQAHS|5|This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do. The instructions are easy to follow. If you can connect your phone to any kind of bluetooth device, you'll have no problem using this.<br /><br />My check engine light was on because of a loose gas cap. I fixed the problem, and this device enabled me to clear the code (and get rid of the check engine light) without wasting my time going to a mechanic.
B00L9OTDCM|1|Same thing as the rest of the reviews. Glad fell out when reapplying controls on a recent bar swap. Not safe. Would not buy again.
B00N396SHE|1|Made my truck idol terrible. Even cut off a couple of times. Garbage!!
B000K05JTW|5|One of the best, if not the best oil filter you can get.  That is why a lot of over the road truckers use them. You cannot have failure when it comes to filtering your oil. Baldwin makes their own filters, they do not buy it and put their name on it. They build them in the USA.<br />I have used several oil filters before but I have to say this one has a good strong steel can and base. One interesting thing about a Baldwin filter, is that it has eight large holes on the base for oil to flow back into the motor after being filtered. Compare it to others and you will see that some just do not have a flow rate as a Baldwin.  Its very good. A lot of filter media area inside if you ever cut one apart, so it will filter a long time.<br />My Dodge Ram's Cummins diesel engine likes them a lot. You will too.
B0032H6QJ2|5|So far I love it. Fits my 2000 Ranger XLT - with 6 ft bed - perfectly. Locks down and seals tightly.No problems at freeway speeds. Extremely easy install, open , close and remove. And it looks great. So here is the secret to installing and removing the cover - the clamps slide easily along the cover - rails only while you have the  clamp at 90 degrees to the cover rail and the cover , but when the clamp is rotated toward the front or back of the truck it will not slide along the rail. I have no idea why it doesn't say that on the instruction sheet or on the video , but this will save you a lot of head scratching.. and possibly damaging the clamp ! Also the lower portion of the clamp will pull a short distance lower toward the truck bed - this allows you extra room to rotate the clamp a couple more turns before positioning the jaw of the clamp below the side rail of the truck.
B00496J7XM|5|It was great. Exactly what I needed, and a perfect fit for my 06 impala.
B00DULUN0S|5|this holds EVERYTHING that I hoped it would. High quality feels very durable
B000HZFDP0|5|I use them on my 2000 2WD tacoma in combo with 4x 50lb sand bags in the bed. I get around ice and snow no problem in Virginia. I have had for a full winter. They are super light and fairly easy to assemble. Much better than chains. They do rust when stored but the rust rubs off when you use them again. Haven't seen any wear that would be concern. Will re-review if they ever break. I had to use them about 5 times this year all over a 20 mile total commute. Best to run on them at 25 or slower speeds.
B00EOX2OKS|3|light plastic not sure mounting screws will hold up.
B001UCBMHW|5|exact oem item.
B00429NKWK|5|Cleaned the lights of 10 year old car extremely wellG
B00KTHZVFI|5|programed easy
B00XZ9PGT8|5|Good
B00KOQ2T5Y|5|Love how it looks on my car. Easy installation
B00FGXEILS|4|easy install works well
B00NJACB3C|5|Awesome!  Can you do A++ here?
B003076AG8|5|Exelente :)
B00M9NGQX6|5|Fits as expected based on FLY online catalog store.<br />Quality product, highly recommended.
B00PYZ00RY|1|The color is Blue and I wanna silver
B00861FT1U|5|Excelente and fit rigth on the box
B00PYZKT70|5|Sturdy, attractive, and a great price
B005ETO8ZU|5|the price seemed fair.  esp. compared to dealer price
B00KWNUBKY|5|Really is a good fit and water tight. The only issue I have is that the clamps don't stay in the folded down position when folding the cover back. This is easily fixed with some black tape wrapped around the bolt so it snaps in place better. Other than that, easy install, looks great and easy to use.
B006CRT72W|1|basura,garbage, only worked for a couple of weeks and thats it,,,,
B00A14H3TG|5|Works great
B0066RU27M|5|Pump works great and still running strong.
B003U6JHQY|5|Really like this exhaust! great sound and power benefits!! Recommend it for sure!
B002UZEC9I|5|I can't really comment on the filter's performance, but 5 stars for the price!!!  Way cheaper than the &#34;stealer&#34;.  They fit my 2009 BMW 528i (E60, N52 Engine) perfectly.
B00AAQNVXC|5|Clearly an aftermarket knock-off, but fit and finish was similar to stock.
B00MV9QNMW|5|Lights are bright enough and they look decent. One of them was defective but already got my problem resolved. I give it 5 stars for a good customer service and fast shipping, 4 stars for the lights but other than that I can't wait to get then properly installed. I'll update my review with some pics of my wip.  Im writing a second part for this review i first posted with the finishing results. these are some pics of how my jeep liberty looks now. it came out good and it looks better.
B008VHQMV0|5|fit perfect !!!
B00H5XFG9U|4|Just like factory new.
B00D6YO7IS|5|Love, love, love this!!!!  Wow.  This is EXACTLY what I wanted.  The mats fit my floorboards like a GLOVE!  And I especially like that the back seat mat covers the hump in the middle.  This was definitely a great purchase.  Every day I get in my new Subaru Forester I smile when I see the mats.  Perfect!
B00068OK8Y|4|Somewhere over the years between projects I managed to lose my boring not-so-special air cleaner nut. I picked up this Mr. Gasket spin nut on a whim. For some reason I assumed it was going to be chrome-coated plastic but it's a pretty nice steel piece. It's smooth on the sides and has a nice raised textured finish on the top section. The black and chrome look is attractive and the nut isn't overwhelmingly large so that it looks out of place or gaudy. I can't say that there's necessarily anything wrong with it, it does its job perfectly well and looks good doing it. For $5 or so it adds a nice little finishing touch to the decoration of your engine bay.
B00CJ017AQ|5|Excellent product, very satisfied
B000QG0PFI|5|All good
B001G72VIK|5|Quality, that's what it is!
B004QPCLC0|5|They were easy to install with the help of google video. When I called my local Toyota dealer to get a comparative price, I was told that the speaker cover is part of the speaker system and I would need to replace the entire speakers for $460.00. I decided that the speaker cover is all I needed to replace so I ordered them from Amazon at a fraction of the cost of the Toyota dealer. It turned out I was right.
B00ARUTXB0|5|Good so far... 400 miles
B0002RNTSG|5|good tool
B000BUTD9S|3|poor quality
B00JXNK1Z4|2|the back bench were perfect but the driver and passenger covers were horrible. First of all it is extremely difficult to get the seat belt through the tiny hole and if you do, the covers are too tight that the seat belt won't pull back. They tore up way too easily while installing. The steering wheel cover was too small and didn't fit my steering wheel. I made a huge mistake ordering something like this online thinking it would fit and be of good quality. I do not recommend.
B000FGJR1W|5|Easy as one two three
B00Q1F74IE|5|Great fit
B00S2IQ98E|5|Good protection and very comfortable.
B00MFROK6Q|5|Very good quality
B00PYZVZFA|4|Works good. Not a real cruise control, but lets me rest my hand
B00120KDEU|5|Great product to protect from spills and keep your carpet looking new
B000C8Y27M|5|Works great in my dash in my 2001 Camry.  Will see how long they last.  I bought some Chinese bulbs at a local auto parts store and they burned out in 2 years.
B00OH0S5Y2|1|Not as bright as stated. They are being used in an rv trailer, inside lighting, and don't match up to old style bulb. Much cooler of course, and will use less power, but not any better than a night light.
B007CISI9S|5|I replaced my budget lift with the Teraflex to gain articulation as 2DR JK does not have the wheel base of JKU to compensate. Budget lift went into our 2015 JKU. I am super happy with Teraflex great quality and I got the articulation I was wanting and the Wife likes the budget lift in her JKU. Teraflex won't let you down they make a solid product with good instructions. 4 of us complete the lift removal and install on both Jeeps in under 4 hours!
B000EZICII|5|This wash product is amazing. Just follow the instructions and it will work great.
B001GJ3FIS|2|Not a great design or construction
B001D9E41I|5|This also is helping to lower our electricity bill for the rv.  You can notice the difference with it reflecting the sun.
B000Z0HVHA|2|After only two uses, this cord developed a short and became useless. The cord itself seems rugged enough, but how the ends are connected is poor and flimsy, which is where is shorts out.
B00HZX1NTM|5|Fits nice and saves my arm getting burn on the center console when the top is off.
B008NYL80G|5|The antenna works great. Very good reception. I like the small profile.
B00CO6F51M|4|Cool looking keychain
B006VEHO8U|4|This is a nice seat belt cover. I thought it would be a little softer but I am using it. It does the job of protecting my neck. I like it fine but don't really 'love' it. The quality is good.
B0087XOTWW|1|1 bulb didnt work out of the package and the second flickers.
B00AVM9K80|5|Product quickly delivered and met my expectations.
B003CSNCUC|5|Easy to install, works great!
B00KYJ2IJS|4|Ah yes, the quest for balancing the Three powers that make your motorcycle run like fresh-forged demon from the depths--fuel, spark and air. We tweak and twiddle and build just to get that combination correct while others simply add more chrome and a few cup holders. Let's say you're like me, busy doing other things to your beloved bike before dumping a serious wad of cash into the fuel system. What is one to do?<br /><br />For me, I route direct to K&N. It's a five minute install that pushes the limits of your ECU; especially if you've already replaced that anemic stock exhaust with something a little more...robust. I promise this will squeeze that last bit of horse out of your machine before you go down the inevitable path of replacing your intake, buying a fuel controller (or rejetting...if you're into that sort of thing) and gibbering madly about Dynocologists.<br /><br />I have a 2014 Yamaha Bolt R-Spec (grey, thank you very much) that is veering far from Factory and frightens small children, soccer moms and many a cafe racer. Next year, this goes in the &#34;emergency&#34; pile as I begin travelling where only madness waits. Until then, my friends, I'll happily sit astride my bike in confidence, listening to the suck and rumble as I ride on down the road.
B00EZYLIM6|5|I got this to replace an incadescent bulbed light that had worn out in my RV. It comes with either the picture amber lens or the clear one. It's noticeably brighter than the incandenscent lamp.
B009M64CAW|3|SEEMS TO BE DOING FINE I THINK THE NEXT TIME I ORDER I'LL  GET 10w40
B00B5ZYY38|5|like the caps
B00CDAOEVG|5|.Well built, perfect fit, nice looking , good sound
B001IH0SGU|2|Two stars because after you fix the manufacturer's F-ups its a beautiful solution,.. And ...<br /><br />Two stars BECAUSE THAT DAMN HITCH DOESNT FIT!<br /><br />Reese~ STOP TRYING TO MAKE YOUR BOLT HOLE TOLERANCES SO TIGHT!!<br /><br />Its a trailer hitch, NOT A SPACESHIP!,.. (When you try to make them that tight~ then blow your measurements in your plant on one or more bolt hole centers,.. Guess what,.. ME,.. YOUR CUSTOMER,.. I get to fix your f-up!<br /><br />Great hitch as long as you dont mind re-drilling the mounting holes for Reese and installing two~ three times because Reese cant read a blueprint.
B008BMDTSE|5|Look amazing in my 02 f150 fog lights!! Very bright and very blue! Only problem is cops don't exactly think so.. still definetly worth the money
B007RCX0LK|5|Excellent product. It was an exact match to the one that had gone bad. I have a John Deere F 915 and this part fit exact. Compared to an alternator from John Deere, I saved approximately $200! That's what I'm talkin about....
B0031I3TNI|5|Perfect fit and look for my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee
B000UBS5VA|1|In the description it says 24x24x18<br />What I received was 24x18x18<br />Can we exchange for the right one?<br />I ordered 2 of these
B00HWIZO6I|5|The Good:<br />- Restore leather like nothing I've ever seen.<br />- Leaves leather feeling soft and shiny, almost like it just came out of the water.<br />- Much cheaper than competitors such as Lexol.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- I can't get enough of this stuff!!<br /><br />The Summary:<br />I've used a handful of different leather conditioning products over the years and none of them really made me completely satisfied. Some of them made the leather shiny but didn't do anything to actually soften it. Some of them softened the leather but didn't do as much as I hoped in terms of enhancing the appearance. This product brightened and softened my leather with a one-two punch that nothing else has. I absolutely recommend this product for anyone who is trying to either extend the life of fresh leather or to help make older leather look new again.
B000YOSNB0|3|Item worked marginally well. It does not properrly fit the rear brake caliper pistons of the Mazda 3.
B00IFMOVE6|3|They don't fit my seats.
B0000AUSEW|4|Not much to say...they work fine and are a nice length to keep your hands away from the fire while roasting marshmallows or hot dogs.
B000CN54CO|5|Fixed a problem I had with the gasket kit I got from Autozone...
B000182DYC|4|They nicely on my 84 k10 . They are not quarter turn .All in all they worth the money .
B00EHLKYKY|5|Looks good on my volvo.
B003KKFAZ2|2|Decided against installing this on the buggy went with a better quality bolt on bumper that came ready to install.
B000JFHNEC|1|Did not fit my Gage set.<br /> My gauges have a schrader valve in each hose end .<br /> Fitting need to have a release pin to use them on R 12 , R22, R502. Gage set . These fittings leaked, make sure you are buying the right fittings.
B001VC2G2G|5|Worked out nice. Take ur time.
B0045J0FFW|5|Great item.
B00KTIR1ZU|4|I used the housings and buttons for my exiting remotes and they worked. Did not try to reprogram.
B00E0FRVMG|2|Fits weird arms are too big, chest is too small. Not worth the headache
