B001V6TIQ4|1|This flimzy thing wouldn't fit my cat and I'm returning it.I'm disapointed in the material and would not recommend this.
B00P87S4JO|5|I like how bright this hat is, love the terry lining at the forehead, and the adjustable fit at back. I like being &#34;Girl de Fuego!&#34; when I wear it i the OR.
B00LNEG2VI|1|This dress looked really pretty in picture.  Totally different story when I got it. Im not skinnny like the model but im not that overweight either 5'6 and 170 pds This dress looked ridiculous on me and for the price the quality sucked. I looked pregnant and bigger then I am.  I review alot of stuff on here  most of the stuff I am very content and happy with This is first thing I have ever hated.
B000P55SL6|5|I prefer this style over A-Shirts because these have a thicker band that goes over the shoulder, and the arm holes are not as large. Neither is the neck hole. This keeps the overall shirt in place, and tightly positioned. It is more like a full T-Shirt with no sleeves to bunch up.<br /><br />The fabric is is nice and even, so it keeps the same level of insulation over the whole torso, and I find that a comfort. Very nice for while I work. The only slight downside is that I have to button all the buttons on the front of my work shirt to cover it, else the casual un-done top button shows the under shirt well.<br /><br />I only wish they made same-color packs, because the black ones go better with my clothes, however the greys are not bad either.
B00IAGZH3Q|3|Make sure to buy a size larger. I wish they have a XX-Large. I would buy because other than to small a fit it feels good to the skin.
B00HPF1N4U|5|My baby girl looked absolutely beautiful in her outfit from my baby's closet.  Everything fit perfectly in the size 3 month and my baby is 6wks old 20 inches and weighs 10 lbs.<br />Thank you to the seller for resolving the headband issue so quickly and making the matching bloomers. I look forward to purchasing more items in the very near future!
B00QV9KRKW|4|Fit great look great. my only improvement would be to make the front pockets a little deeper as my iphone wants to fall out at times. Built well and feels quality.
B00DGMA2A2|3|I am an average size Medium, and the bottom was tiny. The top fit fine; however, the tassles were all wrinkly. Can't speak for after washing it, maybe they would lie flat then.<br />I contacted the seller and am pleased with how they handled it.
B00MXHGAXE|5|Love the scarf and arrived very quickly!
B005R59NTC|4|With this Grid-it panel, any bag I own becomes a camera bag. I slide my extra memory cards, remote trigger, AA batteries for the flaw. I love being able to look at the organizer and see immediately whether I have everything. And it's gray, not black, so I can actually SEE everything inside my bag! Use your imagination, and collect any tools, cords, or extras that you need. This is the perfect place for it.
B0007XXUT8|5|Ihave owned this item before,but was having a hard time finding it in the local stores and I did not think it was being sold until I saw it on your Web Site.Robert B.Linnemann
B002R81AUC|5|These are the cutest and always a big hit at any baby shower that I buy them for! So buy them!!
B006SU4FCK|5|This dress is a great bargain. Fits as expected - hugs curse and gives a very feminine appearance. I highly recommend it.
B0043WYHJQ|5|I loved this Santa! I got this as a gift for myself and it was everything I expected! I also received lots of compliments.
B00INGKXCS|2|The shirt is supposed to say &#34;Wrestling is Life&#34;, but instead says &#34;Wresting is Life.&#34;. I made the mistake of ordering it in a hurry and did not think to check the spelling on the design. When I received my shirt, I was disappointed that the spelling was off. The creator of this design needs to correct the spelling. I was able to get a full refund from CafePress immediately.<br /><br />(CafePress is listed as the seller, but they're only the website that has this shirt listed. They are not at fault- the designer is.)
B00G5JH5Y4|5|The delivery took a little over a month, but that's expected as it is coming a great distance. Thankfully, I didn't need it for anything or that'd be stressful. The sweatshirt was a lovely surprise in the mail, since I had long forgot about it. Honestly, I was completely perplexed by the list of sizes, so I bought the &#34;Regular Size Fits XS-M.&#34; I'm 5'5&#34; and 120lbs if that helps put everything into perspective. The pullover's not fitted but not baggy either. It's soft, the sleeves land at my wrists, and the design looks awesome. Not gonna lie, I was a little worried the design wasn't going to reflect the picture; however, I have to say it looks fantastic. Definitely, planning on buying other fun designs in the future if they look this great. This sweatshirt is NOT meant to keep you warm. It's thin. I think this is great, for you can wear it year round. Just add layers as it gets colder and then remove some as it gets warmer. Hopefully, that was helpful!
B00F10SEP2|5|Great shorts and especially for the money.  So many running shorts in the sporting goods stores are simply too long and constricting.  These are not for the most modest person as the fabric is thin but you can add a jock strap if that's a problem.  The colors are really great.  The maroon is just the right shade for you ASU fans and the other colors are vibrant and attractive.
B000XMDVB0|4|I got this for my daughter and she did not complain. She said it fit comfortably. She said it will do the job.
B0006IBDVQ|5|I couldn't have hoped for better.  The cincher is made with very good quality materials. The fit is excellent, just according to the measurement.  The hook and eye fasteners are rock solid and very easy on the hands.  As I'm in the long, but steady process of downsizing myself, I appreciate so much the excellent support.  It's so comfortable.
B00N1U4XZO|5|I'm also 5'2 about 125, and I also wear a medium or a small usually. But after reading the reviews I went with a large, and it fits perfect! If you do buy this romper go with a bigger size. Yes you'll have to wear skin color undies and bra, but other than that it looks good!
B006UR138K|4|For a cheap bathing suits it's definitely worth the price. Yeah the material is amazing and it's always thin but it really good. I'm normally a small but with this I could have gotten an extra small. It looks great on. It's worth buying id say. I was supposed to receive it in 2 weeks, I got it the next day which is even better.
B00EYPJRDI|5|I love these bras, I wish they were on sale more often.
B00OB0G2E8|5|Color was a little off from what was displayed online, but great quality and fit for my size. Very satisfied.
B00080VFOW|5|My husband had this on his wish list for Christmas.  I ordered and jacket arrived when they told me it would.  Husband was so happy and jacket fits perfect.
B001P7BHPE|4|Love this jacket. My two year old loves it too and didnt want to take it off. I purchased a size larger so that she can also wear it next year. The quality appears to be good.
B00C4YNBDS|5|There are 10 bears hidden somewhere inside this shirt. It is a shirt with 10 hidden bears on it. Enough said. It is amazing. Go buy it. Perfect for the bear enthusiast.
B00B7YL0G6|4|Nice beanie. Thanks
B009S4CYSA|4|Hermosa
B001P268BW|1|Smelled bad
B00SBMWQK6|5|Love these ones. Thick bands comfortable and not to tight and constricting.
B00L4I6RGI|2|Material cheap
B00J3Z1296|5|Very cute, good quality, vibrant colors, great preventing sun, both sides look great and easily reversible, strings helps hat stay on in wind and water
B00BMTRI26|5|This shirt is comfortable and fit as expected. The design looks clean.
B008R6ZC8E|5|Pack comes with six plain white tanks that fit true to size and so far seem pretty durable.  Wish I could could order six of these in black but as far as the white color it's an awesome package.
B008FYA1X4|5|Just right
B00GRUW8PW|5|PERFECT
B00L5M9LD4|4|My granddaughter loves zebra. She wears a 4 but I bought 5t so they would not be tight.
B001XON4BY|4|worked like a charm
B007VV4TSU|2|generally itchy and doesn't fit well.  Much longer than necessary.  the model in the picture must be very very tall.
B00MEBKMNS|2|This item runs very small. I wish I got it in a bigger size. I would have never thought that the 3 x would have been too small. The largest that I have ever worn anything is a 1 x. I went up 2 sizes and it was still a little to small
B00C798CV6|4|Zenana Racerback burnout tank is very thin see through  material.  It fit as expected.  Was perfect to go over bikini top.
B00G5ZMRMI|5|I couldn't find any underwear my 6-year old daughter was comfortable in. The Target stuff was cheap (rode up) and Hannah Anderson was too bulky. These are well made, good fit.
B00NUP7JOC|5|Very beautiful. It look expensive. I love it so much. Thanks for the fast shipping.
B00JF10NWK|2|Nice pair of trousers but the waist clasp is not ber strong and a tight fit
B013AYM5JQ|5|This shirt fit very well and the material was nice and soft. I bought it to wear with PJ bottoms but ended up wearing it with my jeans and now it is my new favorite shirt. I like the neck line and the seams are very well made. I will be buying these for Christmas for family and friends.
B00JX4EMPS|5|My daughter loves this top. It's cute yet it covers her well. Thank you for being the top she wanted.
B00JUM6A3A|2|Has no pockets.  Would not have purchassed, if that was known
B00J5CD6QY|2|The fabric is very see through so I have to wear a slip with it, and the fit is smaller than expected so kept riding up when I tried to wear it.  I do really like the pattern though & was in the process of losing weight anyway so I kept it & now fits fine. But compared to other maxi skirts I've ordered through Amazon - this is my least favorite & fits the worst.  I wouldn't buy again.
B007MY656U|3|The bra is comfortable enough, however, it WILL show! Either the straps show or the v-neckline shows with any kind of shirt I've tried except for a traditional sleeved, scoop-neck Tee-shirt. Not good for most summertime outfits at all.
B008WHIJIS|5|Love It. Perfect cruise shirt!
B0015K96WC|5|I'm kinda heavy and it fit me better than i expected! Form fitting, stretchy and sexy as heck!!! Keep in mind u have to buy the boots and thigh highs. ;)
B00MSQTX16|4|Nice dress, but way too large. I purchased the medium but it fits like an XL. I have no use for it, I doubt I could even pay to have it altered. I'm checking on the return policy.
B0044FOVXE|5|I am a girl, but i liked this hat, so I bought it. It is light,  great cover from sun, looks fancy with my lovely sun glasses and my hair down.<br />Fits big heads :)
B0074DAHWC|2|It was not the style I expected. I expected a slouch in the back but it does not at all. I just had a different look i had in mind when I purchased it.
B00HVKIJ9G|5|Targeted pressure and super adjustable makes this post partum belt the best! Could have worn it under a bridesmaid dress I wore 10 days post c-section! Works under most clothing and is breathable!
B001LZT0P4|5|Just got it today-9/30/14!!  I love it!!  Amazon is #1!!  Awesome!!  Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!!  A++++!!  I will be doing all of my shopping here!!  Outstanding!!  Amazon has everything you could ever imagine & what you need or want!!  Great!!  :o)
B00GMMSTOO|3|The fabric, and quality at okay. But I find that the fit is not as skinny as I am accustomed to. It's a little too baggy in the thighs and seat. And this is coming from someone which has larger than average quads. Furthermore, the fabric is identical to the SSLR brand found in amazon. The other brand is a boot cut. This is probably due to both producers utilizing the same fabric vender. The image led me to believe that these two pants were of different shades.  But this was not the case. Overall, I like the product, but it could be much better.
B000W45T2S|5|She loves these pants for around the house or for getting on the exercise equipment for a workout in the cooler months. She says they are comfortable and fit well. They look kinda trendy for a low priced item of clothing too.
B00MBJ69KS|5|Great quality jeans. Fit true to size.
B00HZVWMR6|1|The material sticks to your skin and it's very hard to put on.  Extremely hot in the summer because material doesn't breathe. Sticks together at the thighs and squeaks when they rub together.
B00GOGBKSK|2|Good quality.  However the hat fits a new born the pants looks like it much small than the top
B00CLBQIPW|1|The color and style are pretty but the material neither smoothes out panty or bra lines nor shapes anything you want shaped. Mine also came defective with small holes in the front under the bodice (they're perfectly straight so it looks like they had a run-in with some kind of machine before being shipped) and the material is so delicate that I imagine this would happen easily; the material seems just a touch stronger than hose. It's going back. Even without the defect, I don't know what I'd do with it.
B00SB1T5RO|3|Looks oldfashion
B00D9OCN4A|5|Adorable sleeve ruffles . I bought this item for 5.59 ...the shirt is a thicker cotton and easy wide neck for quick shirt changes
B004IYIY5W|4|Good, comfortable product.  However, as with most Nautica trousers, button at waist becomes loose and comes off after using a few times
B00939TYAG|5|As I noted on another pair I rated, these are a bit snug and I have small calves. If you have a thicker leg, you may want to go with the &#34;curvy&#34; option that Sock it to Me offers. They're not uncomfortably tight, just really made for a smaller leg. My calves are 12&#34; at the thickest part, I would think these wouldn't stretch more than 14&#34; without being too tight.
B00Q4IGDUI|2|These boxers were tiny! I bought the 9-10 yr size for my 7 yr old and they don't fit! I kept them only because my 5 yr old could use them. Package arrived later than I expected too. I gave it to stars because the material is stretchy.
B00CRWA3NI|5|we love disney and the little mermaid
B00LO3YUTE|3|A bit big not best quality
B00MEDXQEI|5|stuff is very good.
B00DN1BA4S|4|Just as expected and arrived VERY quickly.
B00HMTROMO|4|The colors were bright and there wasn't a stitch out of place. The fit was great through the arms, head and length.
B00K3HH8IM|5|The overall fit is about as you'd expect, however, after reading other reviews stating that this dress is a little short, I decided to order a size larger than what my daughter normally wears, and it comes a couple of inches above her knees. For the price I paid (which was a little over $8), it's not that big of a deal to me. I'll just make some cropped white leggings to go underneath it and it'll be perfect. The fabric doesn't feel cheap to me at all. It's a nice soft lace, and my daughter loves it. She feels like a princess in it. I can't wait to take her Easter pictures! She's going to look so adorable!
B00LUZ6ATO|4|Nice
B00SJKNNIO|3|Liked the look a lot, but it was way too small! A little snug on the body but the arms were at least 2 inches short.  Not what I expected at all.
B00S1VFP78|5|Excellent trouser socks and the delivery and packaging was great. Will definitely order these socks again.
B00D1R7WUK|1|Let me start by saying the seller is really good about shipping. Received in 2 days. But as soon as I tried it on it ripped in the back and it was my size. Material is extremely cheap. I was able to enjoy for all of 1 minutes while I was still adjusting the strings. I tried to contact the company to inform them of this and see about fixing the problem however I don't even see a link to contact seller. I can't email them at all. Just wasted $20 I guess.
B00OMWZTZI|5|Excellent pant for the price ! Very soft and comfortable !
B010GEQ21K|5|I really love these shorts.  Had some major surgery recently and the stretch waist in these shorts makes it super easy to put on, take off and move around.  Went back and bought another half-dozen pair.  Excellent quality and durable too.
B0061I2OJU|3|These gloves look nice, and are really comfortable, but they arrived with one of the tightening straps around the wrist torn off of the glove, so they were returned.
B00DM21VP6|5|My granddaughter needed a coat to wear over her pretty dresses.  Our winters have not been very cold in the last few years so I thought she could wear the fleece for a while.  I don't recommend it in very cold climates because there is no lining and I don't think it would keep the baby too warm.  The matching beret is darling and the flowers on the collar and buttons are darling.  First time I've ordered this brand, but in will again.  Nice quality.
B009VNB7E0|5|Boca makes excellent products. I have their microfiber lined monogrammed robes and that is why I purchased this. It's nice and long, has a pocket and snaps. Great fit, nice material, well constructed. I love it!
B00A2PXN16|5|I love this brand. Boutique quality at very good price. I keep an eye out for sales on Amazon. The colors in this outfit are soft reds in the ruffles, leaning towards pink. Really darling. ! I have bought many outfits from here and have always been pleased!!
B00603WSYC|5|muy bueno
B00EAATQS8|1|Colors are off from photo.  After 1 wear, there was a hole in the seam of the pants.  Not great quality
B00378LD8K|5|I am always in search of a well-fitting bra that has the right amount of padding/shaping. I want it to be flattering but not, um, deceptive. This bra has all the qualities I like for every day, including a great fit. It is super comfortable and looks really good under clothes. It's not glamorous, but one can't have everything.
B002QR7HXS|5|Comfortable belt.
B00KE8H39E|5|These fit him great he loved them and they fit as expected
B003AU5WC8|4|My son loves these.  He likes the comfort and he can dress down or a bit more up with a pair of khakis
B00KVGXWC6|5|Fits perfectly and arrived fast. I'm a big RUSH fan so I definitely love this shirt.
B001FAX68W|3|Serves the purpose and good value. A bit dull, but this ensures that dried perspiration doesn't show through. Some pink/red discoloration on the inside of the bill after perspiring.
B00DTXHJU4|4|The color was very similar to the color online, and the fit was true to the size ordered.  It was hard to iron, and the material had some static to it.  Should be worn with a slip.
B003IMG7QS|1|This is a terrible product.  It is so thin and cheaply made that it fell apart about 2days after I got it.  Not worth buying.
B002928JFA|4|It was a bit bigger than I expected, but still nice. I wanted something I could put on a bracelet but this is the size of a watch face.
B00ECVCXE4|3|It's a wool blend, and it's a little itchy.  It's a little long in the torso, but the material is thin enough that if it bunches at your waist it's not too bad.  Not what I would expect from Columbia, which usually has richer heavier fabrics, but overall not bad as a thin wool pullover for those cool fall nights.  For $90, I'd look elsewhere, but on GoldBox deal for half price, I'd get one.
B00IOADMKS|5|Love it current case at the moment
B00ESFDSYS|4|I ordered all three colors for my wife. She loves the way they fit and feel. She was very surprised that picked out some nice bra's that fit her.
B008Y8VSX8|5|Beautiful shirt.  We always buy geoffrey bean for the quality and fit .
B003Y2CW70|4|I ordered the 14 Small, thinking it meant petite, but it was a 14 petite small, which meant short!  I returned it for the regular 14 petite, and they fit perfectly!  Very easy exchange policy, too.  Love Amazon!!
B00865EFOS|2|Ordered this shirt 1 size larger than I normally wear thinking it would be loose and comfy. It ended up being 1 smaller than I normally wear. Still fits just not the way I would have liked
B000S82WIC|5|These t-shirts came in excellent conditions and well made. The printing was set correctly (i.e. no wrinkles in the lettering or missing parts of the lettering or picture). Great product and delievered before the due date.
B00G2MAJTM|5|Wow, I finally found a bra that actually fits me (32AA)! I think this is the first bra that actually fits me correctly and I am 27 years old. I just could not ever find the right size in any department stores since the smallest they carry are A cups. I have even tried bras from the little girl's section, but they are proportioned wrong, the shoulder straps are way too thin, and are severely itchy. I did an internet search for AA bras and found Lula Lu and picked this bra out . It is super soft, comfortable, doesn't itch, the straps are not too thin, and my breasts actually fill the cups. I would definitely recommend buying this bra even though it is expensive. I would buy another!
B001GCUSNK|2|If u want two ice cream cones.. Go for it...<br />At least the company was very nice in returning this
B00TAVQJCS|1|Too short, cut very small and made cheaply.
B00NEAGXBS|5|Height 175 cm and weight of 70 kg. M size just right.
B003BNZ3ZA|5|This bra is comfortable and it is padded just enough to add a little size.  Is is great for t-shirts and does not cause bulges at the back and sides.
B000Y0ZNM6|5|I absolutely love this coat! I purchased this coat primarily because i like to do things (hobbies/entertainment/household projects) outside even during the winter months and wanted something I wouldn't worry about getting dirty. Not to mention, this coat was half the price of Carhart! I'm so glad i chose this one. The fabric is so soft and is very warm. It does fit a little on the small side, but because i had read some of the other reviews, i purchased a large. I'm 5'5 and normal weight to the highest &#34;winter weight&#34; 140-160 lbs and (even at my heaviest) can wear thick sweaters, sweatshirts or multiple layers and still fit comfortably in this coat with room to move around. I also purchsed the bibs to go along with it which makes the perfect combo for sledding in the snow with the kids!
B004TERIVW|4|This was ordered as xmas gift
B00RZ4ZC5C|5|I really Love the material. I wish there were zippers but it is good anyways
B002HJ3LX0|5|I love gold toe, and these socks are no exception.  The Castaway socks are comfortable and long wearing.  I tossed all of my other black socks and went to just these.
B005M1IGC6|5|Good
B000FEGN34|5|Baby tees are hard to find, but I like to pair them with cloth diapers. These tee-shirts are very soft and look cute. I love the colors. The lap collar design makes them easy to get on and off. However, they are sized small. My 5-month-old is wearing the 6-12 month size.
B0049PPEFI|5|we bought it for our god daughter for her Christening party and because of extreme weather conditions didn't arrived in time. But it looks amazing !
B00KXSMUFM|2|Reading everyone's reviews I thought the product would be small if I ordered my size but I ordered a bigger size cause of everyone else's reviews and its wayyyy to big :(
B00B903AC0|4|I was worried about the quality but it's already held up through several washings. I purchased a small and I'm about a size 5 so I wondered if it would be too small, but really it's perfect. It's got a bit of stretch to it so I honestly think a Medium would have been too big.
B004H3T7AA|5|Very visible and easy to read.. sewed on my hiking gear in case of an emergency.  Great patch, highly recommend
B006TAEBDC|5|I just love this rash guard. Already tested it at the beach and it was exactly what I needed!
B0055M8FLE|5|a
B00JWKX42A|5|They fit perfectly and look extremely good! The shop helped me work out any problems I had! Thank you!
B000QTJ5E2|5|This was a gift for a friends hubby and he loved it.  He owns a Harley and was thrilled to get this robe.  Its hanging in their bathroom and she says he wears it in the house all the time.  Robe arrived quickly and in great condition.
B00BAL2EJI|5|This is such a cute product. My daughter loves mustaches and she loves to wear this. Many compliments.
B002QQ7T5A|5|These are my go-to PJs for any season.  I feel comfortable and not strangled, keeps me cool when warm, and surprisingly comfortable in a winter's home at about 66-62 degrees.
B000X26G3U|3|I normally buy supporters with a 3 inch waist band. This has about a 2 inch band which, to me, isn't as comfortable as a wider band.<br /><br />It's well made and fits well.
B00ASPQAEC|3|I looks nice, a good spring weight for med. temp nights. But the size is off, it fits more like a size 3.
B00EZL9Z24|4|The suit runs large. A size 16w fits me while most of my clothes are 18. The pants stretch. It looks very professional and feminine. Receives a lot of compliments.
B00GIA16OK|5|The shirt came very quickly. It was a gift so I don't know personally how well it fit but she didn't say otherwise. She was very happy with it.
B00D402NL2|4|My 5 month old is 17lbs and very tall. I bought him the Med 6-12 months. It's perfect length wise and he will be able to wear it until next summer. I also love that I don't have to constantly pull a swim shirt down an it dries fast! The fabric is cute and provides extra sun protection too! It's gonna be a great summer!!!!
B00CKGBADI|5|(Kevin's wife) I ordered this on the 15th and received it on the 17th with the company 82. It was so nice to get what I ordered and have it get here when it was supposed to. It has an Azules tag sewn inside so it is the real deal. It is a little shorter than most of my other skirts but only by an inch or two. I am 5'3&#34; and normally wear a size 4-6. I ordered a medium and it is neither too tight nor too loose. The material is very soft and doesn't seem to be see-through. It seems to be very well made. I made sure to check out the company before ordering as I had previously ordered a skirt from Viv which advertised it was made in America. It took forever to arrive and not only wasn't it made by Viv it was from China! I learned an important lesson - check out the seller before you give them your money. I plan on buying more from this seller as they seem to be very reputable.
B000HQ6Q4Q|5|My grandson loved it
B00OK3ST3I|3|Good, but my son ripped a hole in the knee after about 6 weeks of wearing
B004XH5ZII|5|Best deal I could find on a lightweight jacket that dog hair doesn't cling to. Thanks Columbia for making a quality product for less.
B005R9DOB6|5|Just want I needed.. Perfect in every way.. I'm using these gloves for a costume they are exactly as described and the color match was right on
B00UAWGJR6|5|Me and my boyfriend love these shirts, they also fit true to size if anybody is wondering. Somewhat a little big but not too big but we love them and they came in faster than expected. I bought them on a Friday and they were here on a Monday.
B00CK4E3VQ|4|I'm not sure why all these leggings (most of which are made in Asia) are so high-waisted.  A little irritating, but otherwise, the material was nice and soft, the colors were as shown, and the small fit me well even though I'm usually a 0 or XS in bottoms.  I'll just roll over the top as I really don't like anything coming to my navel!
B00PDSXNMQ|4|it is fine, fits good and 3/4 sleeves are good for the summer!
B00CUV2ONS|2|I am returning this item.  The logo is not as pictured.  The name THUNDERBIRD appears above the Bird and the letters are missing their top 1/4, rendering some of them illegible.  Try taking the - off of the T!<br /><br />Very disappointed as I had ordered this for a birthday gift. I have run out of time to order a substitute gift.
B0076T4BQW|2|The sleeves on this jacket are way too long for the normal person.  While I like the coat itself, I can't give a good rating because of the sleeves being too long.
B00B2IQIU0|3|These fit great. But the button fell of on the second or third time wearing them.<br /><br />Still... I like them. They're comfortable.
B00VSFSHCY|4|Super cute and very soft and comfy. Looks just like the picture. The only thing is that I found it to be small in the chest and arms. I just ordered the next size up. I am 5'6&#34; and 135 lbs. with a 34D chest. I usually wear a small, but this was too tight across the chest. Hopefully the medium will be better.
B009PTDQDA|4|This is a cool-looking pin. As a \\"Doctor Who\\" fan, I really wanted to get it - especially because of the caption, \\"Future Doctor's Companion\\". :-)
B000JJIFAO|4|very warm. still get a little cold wearing under armor base 3.0, long sleeve shirt, and the sweater but only when it gets below 15 degrees.  very comfortable, well constructed.
B0019EVB6S|5|This shirt says a lot and all I can hope is that it is accepted in the light-hearted manner in which it was given, OR<br />that it lives up to it's slogan and changes my son's magnetic polarity so that we don't have to suffer through any more psycho girlfriends!<br />PS: Well made and arrived in a flash without any Demonic laughter. It could work!
B005DSC6VK|4|I'm 6'3&#34;, 220 lbs and wear 34&#34; waist pants.  A large fits great in other brands like CK and Papi, but the Diesel ones are a little too small.  I'm afraid to buy XL ones because they would likely be too large.
B00LR13YAO|5|Purchased this for a music festival & had no issues whatsoever.  It fits as expected & i was extremely comfortable even after being on my feet for 12 hours dancing. Great buy!
B000MXB374|2|Upset that the strap broke in a week, and I had previously owned this several bras in this model that lasted for years!
B003LO1XXU|5|The best work pants I've ever owned
B002YJXPAC|4|I wear a size small in almost everything, but because of a another small review I ordered Large.  Hmmm, definitely not loose, and barely covers the crack in the back?  The photo is deceiving as it looks like it comes pretty high up, but rides very low.  Other than the sizing, very cute.  Just ordered a bunch of (XL and XXL) for ladies in a boot-camp I'm teaching.  Just hope they fit!!!  Wish they made some a little bigger (though these girls don't normally wear sizes that big!!)
B00JC3KZFQ|5|cool !!!
B00EZW2E94|5|This shirt was a gift for my son. He has been very pleased with it.
B002YT82DM|4|get them tailored and they'll fit perfectly
B00NI5XTQQ|4|Its pretty big. Hard to control. And the ears are gigantic, and they flop around and dont stay in place. But other than that, its an awesome hat and I really like it ^_^
B00B1K2VF0|4|The dress was too large and too long but it was very cute. I would reccomeend this product to anybody
B006SFSGJS|5|Bought this for my wife and she loved it! Very comfortable and the materials used are of extremely good quality. I highly recommended it!
B00HED0RYA|5|great shirt, love the material and fit. I've gotten a lot of shirts that fit like crap but not this one! I'm 6 feet tall, 180lbs medium build and the size XL gives me a loose relaxed fit without looking too bulky. 5/5
B004GXA732|5|I got these to work out in in general, not really for cycling.  I got a large and I'm a little thick in the thighs, but it is incredibly comfortable.  They don't roll on my legs or tummy, and aren't uncomfortably tight.  Well worth the price and great for boot camp work outs, too!
B00644PDHG|5|Hilarious t-shirt...Especially if you are a fan of Dan Akroyd and John Candy's &#34;Great Outdoors&#34;! Gets lots of attention! thanks
B00AV55M7A|5|Bought for my daughter, and she loved them!!
B0069KH3XW|2|It's nice but the too part I didn't really like
B00EUK557O|5|Better than I expected. Sexy and comfortable.
B007C5M5OA|5|couldn't be happier
B00DUHT3EE|4|These skirts are easy, they fit well, and are comfortable. I've bought 3 of them
B006KZYD4S|4|Good quality of the material is also good to cut. I am satisfied with the goods and the post office as well. The package arrived on time as he wrote.
B007F0WJI4|5|Awesome and comfy!
B00AYQQAG8|5|Heavy duty cotton. Clear design. Have washed twice and looks great. Also got the tank shirt and was pleased with that as well. My son is tall but thin so I waiver between large and XL. Got  XL and looks good.
B00KKCDTQU|4|comfortable fit,iightweight,good sun protection
B003DBEDF6|4|I bought this package of Jockstraps, because I have a Small Groin Hernia that comes and goes, and wearing this Jockstrap keeps everything nice and tight against my Body.  It also lifts my testicles and keeps them from hanging so low that the hernia starts to bother me.  I don't like Jockstraps and have never worn them outside of playing Minor Baseball, so I was not looking forward to buying Jockstraps, nor did I know how to go about it, since it had been awhile.<br />PROS:<br />1. I am sensitive to Dyes and so far these Jockstraps have not bothered me.<br />2. They fit nicely under my Boxer shorts and keep my Male Anatomy lifted up and tight against me, which keeps the  hernia  in and keeps the pain away.<br />3. The Fabric is comfortable, and the straps have a softer cushion on the inside then the outside which feels nice against the skin.<br />CONS:<br />1. The Biggest Problem is the Seam that runs down the Middle! I am Circumcised and the seam spreads open my urethral orifice, or pee hole, and is very uncomfortable. I adjust myself as needed, but through the day, my genitals move around and the seam always opens my urethral orifice.  Unfortunately, this seems to be the issue with almost all Jockstraps.  If anyone can recommend a comfortable, all day wearing, hypo-allergenic, With no Middle Seam, Jockstrap, I would love to hear from you.<br />2. The Fabric, while cool and comfortable does not breathe very well, but does wick away moisture quite well.<br /><br />I hope my comments help, and thank you for taking the time to read my review. @v@
B002HJ3DF6|5|These are fairly thin (but thicker than trouser socks) and others I've had from the same maker were prone to small holes fairly quickly (which I mended).  If you want a really thick sock that will last forever, these aren't for you.  On the plus side, they have a nice stretch, are quite comfortable for wear with everyday shoes and they actually come to the knee.  I like them even with a little occasional mending.
B000MXLYL4|5|Really nice pants and the material is very low maintenance and very wrinkle resistant.  The waist is true to size; however the inseam runs too long.  I always wear a 32 inch inseam in every other brand of pants and this one I had to return them and get a 31 inch inseam.
B00N72ZFZI|1|Ordered a medium and it fits like a small, a little disappointed.
B00KJOWLMW|5|Very nice fit good material
B00F4SKSS2|4|Warning! There is no stretch to this shirt and forget it if you're top heavy. Otherwise it's a cute top. I may just remove the back and replace with another fabric. Came standard mail internationally but still came quickly.
B00IO9H3YU|4|i  love the shirts they were  just what i was looking for but the only thing wrong is that they were a little small
B008XA9V4K|3|Material is a little thin
B006NT5H6Y|5|Bought this coat for my brother his 5'6 160lbs very slim build. Got him small and it fit him like a glove very happy with my purchase.
B0096A1IMO|5|Everybody look on my husband when he wear this t-shirt !!  Soooo cool !
B00N5Z1M86|5|Good fit, lettering is a littttttlllee hiiiigh, but good quality all around.<br /><br />Shipping was fast!
B00246LQOW|5|good buy
B00GXE5O1C|5|I love these bottoms. They fit perfect in every way.
B0098C7XAG|4|Gift for my daughter. She loved it. Wished it was available in color other than white.
B00C1Z2C44|5|Just had a baby and holds my nursing breasts perfectly in place. LOVE this
B006ZVYYFU|3|This socks are not made for us no matter how much we wish they were at this price.  I advise steer clear of these, let the skin and bones folks enjoy.
B0029ITDHM|5|This jacket is great, protect from cold artic winds now in Big Bear, CA.  Just wish there were more pockets inside the jacket
B00JS191Y8|4|nice fit and love calvin kleins
B003P2VQFI|3|The friend I got this for as a gift LOVED it! HOWEVER, it busted the middle V seam the first time she put it on. Luckily, I could repair it, but, still, should not have had to.
B009C65CF6|4|This is a really cute coat for the price.  I wear a medium and this fits perfect.  Nice and warm for the season and looks awesome with black.  My only complaint - it was stuffed in a small package and came out very wrinkled.  Wasn't even folded well.  Only took a couple days hanging to get out the wrinkles. It is what it is for the price.
B00DOE9PVO|5|This was the best halloween costume ever! My son was a hit everywhere we went wearing this costume.
B00IPBQZ50|5|These jeans fit as expected and are great quality.
B00EFX4I2E|4|I took the risk buying the shirt for my 8yr old son. It fit perfectly! My son is happy,  I'm happy :)
B00N4R5VZ0|1|We got it and when my gigirlfriend tried it on found out that the straps where wrong so not to happy with it
B00BYV5X5Q|3|It looks cool and works well but it is quickly falling apart. I have had it for 3 months and it is already started to come unsewn on the seems.
B00P8WQQ80|2|A little bigger that I espect. Is warm enough and I don't have to wear a scarf.<br />I don't know how I'm going to wash it because it says it has to be hand wash and there is no way I'm gonna hand wash a winter coat!!!!
B003VVPYEM|3|This is a nice bra, it was recommended to me by my daughter.  I ordered the size I have worn for years..it is too small.  I think I can wear it if I use extenders; however, I have yet to try them.
B00RM6OA2E|5|This was great will be shopping with u again
B00BQS7EBS|4|I purchased this and it is a little darker than expected, but it is a nice shirt and is well made.
B00MLUOLQG|4|Need to now always wear a hat.  Love it.
B00O1SEJTU|5|YEAH!  Finally no show socks that don't suck.  If you are like me and have had pair after pair of Hue socks that just don't cut it, try these.  They stayed on and were comfy.  NOTE: They do cover more of your foot than other no show socks so they will not work for all shoes.  Consider your shoe's cut and shape before buying.
B00M3IV2CC|4|soft, comfortable...and fits wonderfully!
B001GAP6QQ|1|I orderd 2 pair. I wore both for a day each and both ripped in the same spot during this time.
B005DLB9FG|5|I had breast cancer surgery 4 years ago.  One of things no one ever tells you is that COTTON bras are the best for the recovering breast.  After surgery and for a good while later I was swollen, and the cheap cotton sports bras available at Walmart were a godsend.  After a while, however, I went to the next stage. I could not fit into my old bras,nor could I bear it if I did.  They were too tight, made the scar ITCH(!) and made me sweat. Lace, spandex et.al were relegated to the past.<br /><br />I found these bras through Amazon. They are amazing! They ARE cotton, not cotton lined with polyester.  They have a very comfortable, flat underwire. They fit well AND, in a time when I knew my cup size would change a bit before I was done with the whole process, they were affordable. Instead of paying $40++  for one bra, I was able to get several, and then could shift them around as my breasts adjusted sizes.  First they were swollen, then got smaller, then got larger as the follow-up treatment caused weight gain, smaller when I could exercise, etc.<br /><br />I now can purchase nicer bras for special use, but keep these for daily wear. You can't beat the value or the comfort.
B0084NVUW2|5|very good quality and bright color, especially for the price, the child looks fine in this jacket, it is comfortable and easy to move a great purchase would recommend to all.
B00AK4718K|5|I love it, the colors, the fabric even though they say shorts, I think I will like a little bit longer
B004THUEUG|5|I love this shirt. Awesome graphics. Great attention getter. It exceeded my expectations. The picture on the web doesn't do it justice
B00HSP5TF6|5|The best.  Lightweight, dry, it takes DAYS to make them stink.  Only downside is they are renewable (bamboo), so the heel fabric eventually will wear out.  These are ideal for traveling if you have to make them last an extra day or two and are limited on luggage space!
B00LT6HUJI|4|Beautiful dress great fit a bit more revealing than I had hoped
B00HLX7MN2|5|Love the fit and look.....very cute
B000LXB6FY|5|They are wonderful. Pretty much what I expected. I am happy and not at all disappointed. They arrived just before a cold spell and have been very comfortable and my feet have been warm. Thank you, to you who make and sell them.
B001F7O1P2|2|This belt is certainly not 1.5 inches.  measures only 1.25 in width.  Very disappointing overall.  Definitely not worth the money.
B00KRC2INS|5|Bought as a gift and she loves it! Runs true to size and fits a broader shouldered lady.
B0088CCDB6|5|great bag would buy again
B01073AC1G|5|Great product! Does what it says and inexpensive!
B00B2SDMPE|5|GREAT T-Shirt<br />Just what we wanted!!!!!!!<br />I wish everyone would jump on board and fight with us<br />Keep our Guns!!!!
B00DUGFQBO|4|Fit as expected!
B00C6U13XA|5|Fast delivery and costume fits.
B000IZTQ9I|1|Terrible.  That in a word describes munsingwear briefs now.  They used to be the best briefs around, but since they moved to India the quality and fit may now be the worst of any brief.  Would never buy these again.  They should have stayed where they were and bumped up the price some.  Do yourself a favor and boycott these.
B0050JGRKI|5|perfect fit.  It hugs the contours of your body and stands up to repeated washing without fading.  Worth the price
B000TA1SIY|5|A well cushioned sock, that has kept my feet warm on an occasional colder night so far this year.
B009UXU3KA|3|As the title states, these gloves were nice and warm, but rather itchy. Having long slender fingers, I found that the mitt part was a bit tight length-wise but bunched up width-wise. The material was itchier than I expected and not as soft. I wish I had gotten the other one that I was looking at, but the price for this was better. Poor choice, but oh well.
B00I8HNVDK|3|My junk keeps falling out on the sides of the brief.
B00OZYKU7A|5|See results in one week!
B005FO0YA2|5|great item
B00P7O15NU|5|This cape is a little long,but could be hemmed,and let down as your little girls grows.
B003MSWJ1U|3|I had bought this same blouse years ago and loved it so much I wanted to have an extra  one on hand in case something happened to it.  When I got the new one I noticed right off that  it was a little lighter weight material and the facing down the front was narrower. I checked to see what country it was made in and they were both the same but there was definitely a difference in quality
B007C3ZJTU|5|Keeps my baby nice and warm
B00JZWT3SO|5|Beautiful and comfy, simply amazing!
B00MOIET2G|5|ok
B00DQAAPHO|3|Lovely design and color. Cut very snug, much tighter than size would indicate .
B00T2CKJQC|1|sweetqueen it is a very dificult company for service,  i do not like it the product and was very difficult to back this product to china.but i make it.
B000PG4XW0|2|I found it to run a bit small. Not as comfortable as it's equivalent counterparts that I have been bought in the past.
B003AU5W1E|4|they fit  well, not sure if ill wear them running,there  kinda form fitting, i don't like showing off like that , im a shy guy. maybe just chill shorts, around the house
B00IMSY3LY|5|Great
B00606NLFY|5|Truly a water resistant jacket. Fine quality. Will keep you warm. Nothing can compare, especially for the price. Bought 2 as gifts.
B004TGAYGQ|5|Excellent hat with good sun protection and quality materials.
B00KIL3LPW|5|Fits great I'm 5'-0&#34; , 120lbs and ordered a size small. Wear a 34D cup and the top fits fine just have to wear a bra for support.
B003KQ696A|4|It is well made and fits just a bit tighter than my other watch cap, which was military surplus.
B000GHDHBG|3|Not good material.
B00NYD8CYQ|5|It's fire 🔥
B0084B7CF8|5|It is a little baggier than I expected. Of course, I chose to ignore some of the reviews concerning the coat running bigger than expected. Ok, with that said, the quality is stellar and it is really warm. I can wear a T-shirt under this coat and still feel warm. I’d suggest measuring yourself before you buy it. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase. I would recommend this product.
B00CHY9VG6|4|Did not quite fit my waist or behind well so had to get them tailored, but now they look great.
B00HYFT5FA|4|Cute comfy. Runs small great price
B0018P61RC|5|I absolutely love these jeans! They sit perfectly low in front (without being ridiculously low), and higher in the back so I don't have to worry about things I don't want showing everytime I bend over. I do recommend getting a size smaller than you normally would because the little bit of stretch they have in them seems to make them loosen up after wearing them for a little while. I'm so mad at Levi's for discontinuing these jeans! I've tried on the line that is supposed to be replacing the 545 low boot cut, and they do NOT fit the same, or look as flattering. Thumbs down to Levi's marketing department, thumbs up to the 545 low rise boot cut! Grab them while you can.
B011628DPE|3|Will be returning these pants even though the style is cute. Too long on me even though I am 5 foot 5. Also a bit small in the hips and thighs. I ordered a large/xl since I normally wear a size 12/14.
B0080DJ4WO|5|I am pear shaped and often struggle with how shorts fit. I am between a small and medium in most brands, went with Medium for the Oakley Movement short and love how they fit. Compression shorts tend to be uncomfortable, so I like that these fit a little looser around the leg band, and they really don't ride up. They are definitely comfortable to move around in. I would love to order several more pairs!
B00GIDTFR2|3|This top is little transparent, light weight. But it looks good. Okay to buy, not so great though. It is exactly the same as shown in the picture.
B00NIN2J4Q|5|Great quality for the price.
B00UKQJXT8|5|The shipping took a lil longer then the promise time On Amazon BUT when I received the swimsuit I IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE this is a MUST HAVE.. but please order one size Up from your Normal size
B001H0KNYA|5|Very true to description.  Perfect size and color.
B00505DVCO|3|I ordered a medium but got a large. Didn't have time to return it so I just wore it.
B00CB4PJZE|2|They run small but good thing i am losing weight.
B00KPXZT1W|4|Nice and easy shirt.
B00NIYIR2S|5|My daughter just loves this Mudkip T-shirt.  It has a little mudkip on the back and a little Pokeball on one sleeve.
B007N47NOC|5|Very good lenses, fits perfectly and very comfortable to use in a sunny day. Besides, the look it gives to the Oakley sunglasses is really good.
B00JOS8AAG|3|I would have liked it more in a Black Shirt. Seems they only had Red.
B008TV4VKW|5|I loved the detail and craftsmanship on this trunks. Although I wear jeans size 36 and usually buy size L boxers I decided to go with XL size from Hugo Boss and it fits me well. As you can see from the picture this trunks are a little bit on the shorter side but the material is very good and the trunks fit me perfectly. The parcel came beautifully wrapped and I got 20% discount from the seller on my next purchase. I was one happy piranha :)
B000G2VA6A|2|I am keeping these reluctantly as the legs and thighs fit OK but won't buy any plus size pants online again given this new \\"make these ladies have an hour glass figure with a thick tight elastic waist\\" trend. The pants hurt around the waist if I button them up also given I have GI issues like surgical adhesions pressing on my organs. I don't need a girdle tight elastic waist pressing on them as well. I have another pair of Lees relaxed fit jeans from a year ago I will wear when I need to button up my pants in company. These are just for shopping with a coat over them or the like.But then I got creative and made two slight nicks in the waist band where the elastic is and Removed part of it. Ah no pain, I've more to do all without ruining the waistband--just a little nick that will help me cut and remove the elastic is what I needed to do. But never again will I buy plus size pants online again--I found the same girdle pain waistband on a pair of capris.
B004LQ1GD4|4|Purchased this set on sale for my daughter-in-law who is having a boy next month (my first grandchild :D !) and she liked it very much. It is nicely boxed and giftable. I think it is a little large for a newborn, especially the sox are too big, but all of the items are very useful and will be worn. I think this company makes good quality baby clothes; I also got a set of plain white onsies and they are very well made.
B0031WTP6O|5|I never actually received the item that I ordered, but i was given a full refund and it was a very easy process. I would buy from your again any day knowing how easy it is to get into contact with you about the order.
B00OLHIJ9M|4|First of all, this thing looks absolutely amazing on me when it's laced up the back and tied tight. Like most corsets,though, the sizing is crazy.  I'm 210 pounds, size 16 and ordered the 6XL actually thinking I should have gone a size down, but if they'd had a size up it would have worked better.  I had to get my husband to help me put it on the first time lol<br /><br />Unless you want to wear it unlaced, or maybe add another fabric panel in the back yourself (that could be cute), this corset is not sized for anyone over about a size 18.  Also, the cups are way too big for me in the size I ordered, I have to lace extra tight up top.
B001AJW3T6|5|i always bought cheap twenty dollar hats to wear when  it rains and my wife told me I needed a crushable fedora. We read reviews and ordred this hat . I love it.
B00KOKZTU2|2|Ordered the XL size and it was way too small for my size 14 wife.  So disappointed.  Ended up just throwing it out
B000FBBD3W|5|This is my third Icebreaker top - I also have a Bodyfit 260 Crewe and Sport LTD Pinnacle. Like the othersthe Coronet is soft, very warm and doesn't hold a smell! It's a very functional top, I use the zipper to regulate the heat between indoors and outdoors and the thumb loops to keep the sleeves down and my wrists warm. The only gripe, and it's a minor one, is that the thumb loops feel a little \\"chunky\\" in the webbing between my thumb and index finger. All in all, a great investment for future cold winters!
B00J65CL9S|4|I usually have a hard time ordering pants by mail. Half the time they are either to short, to tight in the waist, or baggy. I had to wait longer for shipment with these cargo pants but the wait was worth it. For hunting pants I could not be happier. The fit was perfect and the material was very soft and comfortable. I walked for miles in the bottom lands of Arkansas through swamps and thorns without an issue. They wash up well and look great after a week in the woods. Great pants at a very good price.
B000XH8O7Q|5|The price was right, the material is the same as more expensive t-shirts I have bought.  There is a tag, it is in the hem at the bottom of the shirt.  A printed label is in the neck, neither one bothered me.  I wished the t-shirts had been a little bit longer, but being a tall person, this is something I have to live with regardless of brand.  I ordered 10 shirts, so the cost of freight was not the issue it would have been if I had just ordered one.
B00ITOJQGS|5|Very high quality, way better than I expected.  And a great price!
B0018OMFLE|5|Best pants I've ever owned for the price.  Comfortable, sturdy, and manly.
B00YHA63BY|1|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is not the Gworld Brand just a copy
B00QN8MAH4|4|Didn't realize they weren't joggers, the legs are wide they don't cuff or have elastic at the ankles.
B0087WIMJO|2|The style is cute, as presented in the photo, but the materials used are cheap and I am doubtful that it would have lasted through one washing. Even though I liked the style I couldn't justify the amount of money spent on the skirt and the actual product, so it was returned.
B001S21JWW|5|Excellent, very good product.
B00DQVTLSW|5|Fit great!  Quite slimming.
B000N8X5XS|5|Awesome pair of pants! No complaints!
B00HXBCOBM|4|This belt is a good uncommon color: brown mostly, but more ochre than the usual.  1mm narrower than another John Varvatos belt described to be 1mm wider.  Ordered a 36; it fits like a 35.  Wish I could order a 37 to compensate for the missing inch.  If you're in between sizes order bigger.
B00Q8Q3O94|5|Soft and cute
B00GTEOW1O|5|Before purchasing I took heed of the fit reviews and decided to buy a smaller size. It fits great!
B009AAMHUC|5|I love the hat! I bought three so my friends and I can wear it when we drive my truck in the city! gets looks and laughs.<br /><br />HUUUUGE! I can't even actually wear it without slouching in my seat (plus could be a bit of a vision hazard while driving.) Also, at 6'2&#34; i cant walk through doorways with this thing on (probably an additional 10-12&#34; above your height when wearing it...<br /><br />price is right, quality as expected, sellers fantastic to deal with. would definitely recommend!
B00F9UFT6Q|5|Nice looking and fitting sweater. Pretty color. Not to thickest sweater, but wearable under a suit jacket.
B00J08XY5Q|5|Not easy to find Willy's jeep stuff. Really like the hat.
B00V684MZ4|4|Super comfortable
B00DQHXEKW|3|It's comfortable, fits well and I'm 5 foot 3. The color is not so much burgundy but brown and the dots are yellowish. The belt sent with it is black, not white but overall, for the price it's not bad.
B00GLLVH68|5|Fast delivery, great price, excellent quality. Love it!
B00LOL6M5G|4|not the cotton/ poly blend I was hoping for, but the fit is still much better than most shirts for tall/ athletic build. Unlike way too many brands who think everyone is short and fat.
B00BEMWJ7K|4|Since the 6 was VERY small ( Calvin Kline seems to run small).  I have gained 5 lbs., so this is why I went with the 10 vs the 8 with the replacement.  The quality is great !
B0045ZHKH2|4|Even with platform Mary janes, it was long. It was cut a little deeper in the front than it looks in the picture. I loved it and got lots of compliments wearing it. It was comfortable to wear.
B009L1Q9W2|5|I wanted a simple pair of shorts. These are tough and fit as expected. They are not strechy like some of the new materials, but should last a long time.
B00AFUEBL4|5|My wife can never find jeans that fit and someone recommended levis. She loves the fit of these curve style jeans and I think she looks great.
B00CYBCK4C|4|I ordered the blue suit in a large. I am 5'9 150 lbs and it fits well. The bottoms are snug but not squeezing my body at all. The top, while it is cute, is a little strange. Its short, only covers a few inches of boobs. And it did not come with straps as promised which I was very disappointed with. Overall for the price I guess I can't complain, just wish it came with everything that I paid for.
B00CPTW8BI|2|This hat came to large for me.  I have to pad the headband.  Its shape is difficult to work.  I think that had i purchased this in the store I would have gotten the propper size and had them shape it for me.
B00MOY7VUC|5|Is pink and protect face and from wind child very happy.
B00A3ERV46|5|There's a lot to dislike about traditional white undershirts: bulkiness, visible collars, untucking due to short length. The Invisible Undershirt solves all of these problems. I love that the collar and sleeves aren't visible at all, even through a white dress shirt, and the length ensures that it won't come untucked when I sit or lean over. The tight fit is quite nice as well, it makes me feel like I'm in better shape than I really am. I'm definitely looking to get a few more of these and retire my white undershirts for good.
B00JAE9CYC|2|WOW ! Very well made, excellent quality, cotton has a nice weight to it, and the dog is fuzzy and adorable. I'd wear this ! Wish it came in more colors. Great purchase !<br /><br />** Update; Sad to say the color washed completely out of this and ruined the white dog. It's unwearable now.
B009CCRK8C|5|These socks are very soft and not scratchy at all!<br /><br />They are also very warm!<br /><br />I got a large size because I wash and dry them in the dryer so they shrink. So far they did not shrink too much, they are a bit too big for me (I'm ~ size 9), but I think it's not a problem at all.<br /><br />I recommend them to anyone who wants warm and comfortable socks.
B00GHPIVS0|5|I absolutely love this shirt!  Shipment was fast. My son is home on leave and I'm going to wear it often!  I have several Navy Mom shirts and this one is my favorite by far.
B007V33JHU|5|My husband gets great sunburn protection during his workday.
B001MD48CA|5|I know, I know, intention is for guns, but that trigger finger is perfect for my gear shifts while the mitten portion is perfect for my brakes. The bicycling world is devoid of legitimate winter gloves. Outer shell protects against wind and rain, while inner glove stays dry. Excellent gloves.
B00BOET2IW|5|Arrived when it said it would, such a great item to have in my backpack. Perfect size, and great flag!
B007P4SAGA|5|I usually wear Cherokee brand but I saw these and thought they were so cute so gave them a shot. I usually wear extra small tall in cherokee, but this brand just needed a small! They fit great. I love the bold colors and cute accents. The material really feels about the same as cherokee, not any softer.
B002PIJUTW|4|Decent quality, nice product. The hat is a little strange and pictures don't show very clearly what it looks like all around. The outfit fits my son who typically wears 0-3 months. I'd read in other reviews that it runs a little small and I found that to be the case as well. It's cute. Given the opportunity, I'd buy it again.
B00CAAK0SK|2|I guess this isn´t my style. Are bigger as expected and shorter. ...They are very stretchy. Gave them some of my friends to try them on, and they just didn´t look good on anyone... :(
B005C9GLZC|4|Not tight on the waist, somewhat thin but does the job.  Pretty good deal given the price, good buy no regrets.
B003WOKYUW|4|was very nice fit as expected all was good,  to many word  so this is just some filler 2 more
B00IUV4UF2|4|I still love the pattern and the material; they're well-made and adorable.  But they're apparently junior sizes, because an XL doesn't even come close to fitting an adult woman who regularly fits into L/XL in most other brands.
B009DNWG5C|3|The thickness is what I was expected, but it's shine and with 2 lines on the front and back. More like tights, not leggings. I will wear them under my pants, but not wearing them alone.
B007A60CH8|5|Wife likes it
B00AOCX43Y|5|I wear this sweater too much. It's comfy and adorable! It's a thinner material but i like it like that, it looks good with a skirt or skinny jeans or nice tights or leggings.<br />If i don't know what to wear I just throw this on, instant outfit.
B0087C61QK|1|sent back.  too small.  stride on pants too short.  Sizing is not accurate in the description.  Poor quality of material
B001CGE0P2|3|The dress is nice, I like the headband too. But the bead n cigarette holder were missing. That's a bummer:(
B00IIMFPMK|4|Prefer size and comfortable
B000RFP1KM|5|Fast delivery and good product.
B00OIF04N6|5|Love it!
B00EVLTGKY|5|Stop scaring off the big busted ladies, these bras are amazing!<br /><br />First off, the size chart is not very good. American bra sizing is terrible, and you should feel terrible for using it. Your band size is what your tape measure gives you, plus/minus one if you are an odd number, none of that +4&#34; stuff. Google 'reddit better bra fitting guide', it will change your life. I fell in love with these bras because it is so hard to find something with a small band that will accomodate larger cups, and they are so comfy.<br /><br />Size small was just fine for my 28F chest (Victoria's Secret tries to put me in a 32DD). I am now pregnant, so the small was too snug when I hit a 28G, so I'm upgrading to a medium. I tried ordering some nursing and maternity bras but they ride up into my underboob which is so not okay for super sore pregnant breasts. I'll probably just wear these bras forever.<br /><br />P.S. By convertible, they just mean you can use it as a strapless or a single strap (do they even still have one armed shirts?)...that is, if you have a smaller perkier cup size, otherwise, you really need those straps!
B00FP462DK|5|Work Great
B00C5ISWSM|5|This is an Xmas gift. We hope it fits and the quality is good. The purchase transaction was perfect though.
B0041OFBNC|4|For one of the typically costume brands this was actually well made.  It comes fairly large, but you can always pin it or sew it to the size you want.  It looks really cool, too.
B007ZXBWOS|5|The belt fits nice and looks good. I will wear it alot and it appears that it will wear well.<br /><br />11/15/13: I wear it every day and is in great shape. Even though it is a dress belt, I wear it in a factory and with casual jeans. I learned from my last heavy dress belt, they wear much better than work belts. It does not show, because shirt tail is out.
B008O811QC|5|My hubby loved it.  Great Shirt, fits well
B006YZ7SVY|4|I was really excited to get this dress, but was a bit surprised when it came. The dress is just a cotton blend and has typical stitching on the sides and hems. For over $70 I was expecting something a little more high end than it actually is. But the fabric is not see through and it is incredibly flattering on both me and my mom (our shapes are very different), Heads up: Its much lower in the back then it seems in the pictures (I had to order a backless bra right away).... I do love it, I just think UjENA overcharges for most of their clothes.
B004MYFQVS|4|Fifth Sun Mens WWE Fly High Short-Sleeve T-Shirt is good product.Made from good material.Deliver on time.Item as prescribed but the size is bit big
B00DROSK4E|5|Wonderful
B004XFGJEO|5|Love it
B00ATG54LK|5|This is probably the cutest hoodie I've ever seen. 6x fits my almost 7 year old perfectly and she absolutely loves it. Looks just like the picture and seems to be very well made.
B004UM7YUS|5|It's always been a life long goal of mine to travel while wearing the aforementioned Pinstripe suit and fedora (similar to what Jack White wears during the 2012 Voodoo Experience).  It's impossible for me to fully express the sheer joy that has come over me now that I've found this beautifully crafted product.<br /><br />But the hats usefulness doesn't just end as a suit accessory it gives you confidence that you just don't get out of your typical trucker style cap.  At the beach it takes the focus off the banana hammock and keeps the ladies looking above the waist (Who likes feeling like an object!?!).<br /><br />So in closing, buy this hat.  It will change your life forever.
B00KDGJPR0|5|I wear a size 20 in pants, and the 2x in this fit perfectly.  I absolutely love it! It's easy to pull on, and it's so comfortable that you don't even feel like you've got it on.  It smooths things out nicely!
B001CBD5XA|5|My favorite undies!  Fit is great, quality is above average and this purchase was textbook perfect. Exceeded my expectations.
B00JG3R0RS|4|The color is very nice<br />I ordered a size up and it's small.
B00GOL1NYG|3|Cute sweater but runs a little small. I bought three of these. One for myself and my two teenage daughters.
B000QUZ2FC|5|I am happy with this bra.  I ordered it b/c 1.) I've stopped wearing bras completely b/c I can't stand the straps, 2) I wanted something to smooth out and subtly enhance my A-cup bust, 3) I didn't want to pay $50 that the NuBra cost.      I've never tried the NuBra so I can't compare it to any other similar products, but this bra is def and off-brand imitation (The packaging calls it the UnBra in the instructions), but seems perfect.      It comes as two cups which you place independently on each breast (they stick) then you can join the clasp in the center to pull the breast together to give lift and cleavage.  I've been using it for a week now and find that I don't usually join the clasp since I am so small I don't need the extra support and it gives a more relaxed feeling, but I prefer to use the clasp with some of my more revealing tops. It works either way which is nice since it gives some flexibility.      One option I haven't tried is using it with a standard bra as more of an insert.  I think this would be easy to do if you want some enhancement with a bra you currently own, just apply these as normal, then put on standard bra.  I don't think I will do this since I am looking to completely replace my standard bras.      It's enhancement is subtle, maybe not a cup increase, but I didn't want something obvious, so it's just what I needed.  I love how it feels to touch.  Feels very natural and I keep wanting to poke it while I'm wearing it just b/c it's fun to touch.      I wore it with one sheer shirt that I always need to wear an under shirt with so my bras don't show, but I was able to skip the undershirt and get clean, smooth lines so that was nice.      The only to potential cons are 1) I'm a little worried the clasp could wear out with excessive use.  It looks sturdy, but it does undergo some strain when in use.  This could be the same for all similar products and it's sturdy so far, but that is one thing I am watching.      The second thing 2) was mentioned in other reviews.  B/c it is silicon, it is not breathable and therefore moisture can build up from perspiration.  This can make the bra feel a little uncomfortable, but still feels a lot better than wearing a bra with straps or under-wires.  This is just a fact of this style of bra and it is something I'm more than happy to deal with since it is really minor.  I didn't notice any smell or negative attributes that one reviewer mentioned, though someone with sensitive skin may have some issues, I don't know.      Over all, I am very happy with it.  Now that I know I like this style I may try more expensive ones in different shapes, or I may just buy another one of these after mine wears out from excessive use:)  It was very affordable, easy to use and I'm thrilled being able to go without straps.
B0079MIMEI|3|The color seemed much lighter than pictured.  The small seemed too small.  I bought this for my daughter who is just moving into adult sizes and this garment was much smaller than a lot of the children Lg / XL sizes.
B008L5FN9E|5|Loved the towel wrap.
B00INKNB6O|4|The fit was somewhat smaller than the other Calvin Klein sweaters I have purchased for my sons in the past. The look is very nice, but I have to hang-dry it after washing to avoid any extra shrinkage.
B003XVYB30|5|I bought these pants for Spring mud run. The went on 5 mile hike over obstacles and through cold muddy water. They kept my legs warm. The fabric is thick, but it dried very quickly. They washed easily in machine and were very comfortable
B00KWIKXZC|5|Very nice color and perfect stitches.
B0054IFOHW|5|These jeans are nice quality and color - dark but not too dark.  I had purchased [[ASIN:B0054I2ZMY Quiksilver Boys 8-20 Salad Days Skinny Fit Jean]] (in 2-7 size) and they were so skinny that my son had trouble putting them on & therefore refuses to wear them.  He struggled to even get them over his feet.  These ones have the skinny jean look (which is perfect for my tall/thin boy) without too difficult to put on.  My son is about 42 pounds & 46\\" and the small fits perfectly.  Note that Quiksilver sizing is as follows (roughly - I think it runs big)<br /><br />Small = 5<br />Medium = 6<br />Large = 7<br />Extra Large = 7-8
B007KFZEOA|5|comfortable and supportive!  Keeps the cleavage at bay and looks like you're wearing a cami.  Surprisingly great!
B006G3IPHU|5|I know it said men's but I wanted it anyway. The color pops and is fun with many outfits. Fits great and super cute. Shipping was fast.
B005C5I60Y|4|Super cute for Halloween!  :)
B00UOY3EGY|5|Very pretty dress.  I ordered a size lower than I should have (wishful thinking) so exchanged it, but the dress is very nice.  Great princess seams on top and nicely lined all over.  I disagree with the reviewers who said it is too see through.  It is lined.  I would not feel the need to wear a slip under it.
B00BCZ2I7K|5|Like the idea that I can wear it on both sides.
B00CEMOM10|3|I really enjoy the Andrew Christian line if products just very hard to guess if they are going to run big or small.  I'm this case it was way small.
B00A7QUD6I|5|Super soft, they don't shrink too much. My new favorite undershirts
B00HNXFTLC|5|Bought this for my husband for xmas. He has a large head and has a difficult time finding an adjustable baseball hat that fits  to put things into perspective. This beanie hat fits him perfectly and he loves it. He also likes that it is reversible. Price was great too.
B0050SPLY2|5|defenetly better quality than the wal mart junk. many functional pockets for your mp3 player and great pouch for a laptop or tablet. only thing i wish it had was a special protectvie pouch for my oakley eyeware. but it dose has a special strap on the shoulder strap for your eyewear.another nice feature is the padding between your back and the compartments. I get compilents on how cool my flak pack is all the time.
B00NJBQGAK|3|The shirt looks nothing like the first picture. . It's a cute shirt but very fragile and snags very very easy. It will get worn but I really wish it looked more like the picture since that's why I ordered it
B00368CL6O|4|It's kind of tighter than expected and definitely visible if you wear clothes over it.
B00CMV7W6A|5|the product is excellent I have no complaints about it as I really like is described in the information provided to me is worth the investment, thanks
B004323QHU|4|I gave these to my husband before a formal event we attended.  He found them a little more difficult to put on by himself do to the curvature of the piece that goes through the &#34;button holes&#34;.  But once they were on, he loved them!  Looked great with his tuxedo.
B00GQ3O8MG|1|This dress is made of is the thinnest spamdex ever. Disappointing but this should have been expected based on the price.
B000UJF77C|5|Great product and speedy shipping.  IF looking for favorite dog breed baseball cap, highly recommend.
B007I7H0RE|5|My  job requires that i carry a clear bag and this is what i have been looking for. Perfect size.
B005GLKNZA|3|It fits well. Slims you figure.  Only instead of pockets it is<br />like a sweatshirt you can only put your hands in.  Top scrubs really<br />need pockets whatever you do in health care!
B0029O00JG|1|Doesn't fit well at all, very disappointed, sit well, waist is big and the legs are too narrow, zipper is already on it's wayout
B00AKSCXBG|4|Very comfortable. Look good.<br />Would have been better with back pockets.
B00C80KJ7E|5|At 25, I'm definitely not a junior but I am short and petite. Hence, this was perfect for me. If you are like me who can't find the right size in the adult section, junior sizes tend to help. And this one in particular is comfortable and fit like it was custom made for me.
B008FV74FU|5|One size fits all.... it definitely fits. Well fits my fiance. If you are a smaller woman, this will definitely leave you swimming in a night shirt (that's good right?). For larger women that's up to say size 18, this should still be oversized on you too.   She loves it. Buy it too.
B003NX87TC|5|I'm a size 14 but prefer a little larger to account for a sweater underneath and ordered my usual XL despite the reviews that say it runs large. Glad I did as I found it to be just right compared to other XL clothing I own.  I also think the thickness is just right and not flimsy at all.  Can you see light through it if you hold it up to one? Yes, but the fabric would have to be extremely thick to not.  If you rely on this for really cold temps, it's probably not enough.  For me in 35-50 degree high desert weather over a long sleeve T or turtle is just right when I'm moderately exercising. If it's on the colder I add a hat and gloves and feel just right. I have found it to be high quality and on par with one I ordered from Lands End.  It has more feminine styling compared to the Lands End one, too.  Very soft and cozy and perfect for the moderate high desert Idaho climate.
B007BRXH78|5|Very classy, well-made pants.
B00FC5NHK8|5|Strong bag...bigger then I thought,I can fit a ton of things in here
B007HJG6B4|3|This sports bra fits as expected but your boobies fall out when u lean forward too much,  if u have big breast. I'm a 38 DD so for me it's not one of my favorites
B00961P9CS|4|It fits well and after the first wash it did well, no fading or stretching. I would order it again.
B00JDPRVEQ|4|A bit short in length if you're over 5'5
B00JR6J5VI|1|order this but instead received a Necktie Gold Patterned - 84060... Really?
B00BBKGKSE|4|After 4 months or so, these briefs are still in good condition.  A little pricey perhaps; however, this has turned out to be a quality product well worth the investment.
B007EKQ7QU|4|They fit well and keep ears warm!  They don't mess your hair - but then they don't keep your head warm either.
B00KFBEJQK|5|This is a gift and has not been given to my grandson.
B00ZN6EYI0|5|This is darling!  Very chic and different from most suits.  I am 62, 5'8&#34; and am 135 lbs.  The fit was just right.  There is some exposed areas that are covered in netting...very cute!  Nice swimsuit for this grandma of four...:-)
B00CJQI2US|4|This dress is very sexy with a great price tag as well. I followed the measurements for the dress and found the waist to be a little big. I took it in and it fit perfectly everywhere else.
B00NJLLT1G|1|after waiting for over 4 weeks, the watch came, and the watch itself was not onto the band....i though there was something to snap it onto,  only to realise, that there was suppose to be two pin thingys to hold it in place that was not there...... this is mess....i want my refund
B005PMVZLG|5|LOVE IT!!!
B00AZ746GM|4|These shorts fit a little bigger than expected but they are comfortable and I would buy more of them; preferably in a different shade of blue.
B0037ZD638|5|Nice fit and very comfortable.
B005NQKI1M|5|I ordered my first about a month ago, I loved it so much I ordered my mother one and also my very pregnant daughter one.  I also ordered myself another one.  They are soft, warm but not to warm, they have pockets [which I love] and since I am tall [about 5'10\\"] they come down aout 6 inches below my knees.  So if you like warm and comfortable night wear you can't go wrong.
B003S808OE|5|This is the second pair of 180's that I have owned.  They are very well made and provide the warmth that I need in cold weather.
B00E8YM610|1|The dress looks great on the model, however, when it finally arrived, it was not as shiny and snake skin looking as advertised. The specifications on fit is also false. Wife was not able to get it over her shoulders and she's petite. A poorly sewn strap on the back broke trying to get the dress off. Dress immediately went to the donate to Goodwill pile.
B00OZ227A0|5|sexy as hell great fit!
B00JYOPVCK|4|Ordered two hats. Smart packaging. They are made from cellulose, impressive quality. The weave is excellent for the price! The size is not perfect but approximate. Used a cloth steamer to straighten it to my liking and to try to enlarge it a little. Happy with my purchase. :)
B0053XF860|5|My husband love it.
B00ARDD642|3|They are ok a little thin and run smaller than other brands. They fit fine if you go up one size from the size you actually need.
B001OSBE7K|5|I wear this bra everyday, not just for exercise.  It is so supportive and provides a great shape.  Also, it helps to remind you to have good posture.<br />Try it!!
B00ESK3Y4W|5|Got this for my little girl for her 5th birthday and she loves it. She tried wearing it everyday for a week.
B002X8HSFW|3|When I saw this scarf/kaffiyeh I just had to have it, I adore the smiley face prints. It is a nice size and quite functional. I wear it with many different outfits.<br />My only complaint is the softness or rather, the lack thereof. It is stiff and hard. I tossed it and a dryer sheet in the dryer, to no avail. I did this 3 times over 1 week. I am going to try washing it with a touch extra fabric softener than usual. But I do love the design of this scarf and have received numerous compliments, even from guys!
B00CPKOIM4|5|Awesome for winter!
B006V4HVS8|5|We ordered two different tartans and we are absolutely delighted with both.  They are quality products and are just what we wanted.  The seller could not have been more helpful and we would recommend both the product and the sellers without hesitation.
B00AF5OJ0W|5|I was very surprised at the quality of this wig at such a reasonable price! It was a hit at my son's 80's day at school!
B00LBD0NWA|2|I have other Simply Southern T-shirts. The other ones I've bought from STORES are soft and thick material that I like. This one I bought on here, the material is thin and rough on my skin. I looked on the label and it's a different T-shirt company than the rest of the ones I have. I do not recommend. I'm not so happy with it. Better off going to a store. Same price too.
B00FYEZCOG|5|I am a Physical Therapist and I've used DIckies and this specific EDS before.  I love the larger sized pockets as well as the general durability/move-a-bility it allows me when performing things like squats and twisting needed for patient transfers.
B00G3CSY02|5|Perfect...yes very lightwweight but just what I wanted....I wanted them for fashion not warmth....any heavier and I would burn up!
B00J9UO5A8|5|I just received my shirts in the mail. I rarely order online because most of the time it 's not what you thought it was. I was pleasantly surprised they exceeded my expectations. They are wonderful and will buy more as soon as I need them.
B000UL5YCS|4|I bought this watch for my 17 years old daughter, to replace the one she broke in a fall. The girls in Rio seem to appreciate this model a lot.
B00B8H6QOI|4|Just what I was looking for at reasonable price, delivered in timely manner as specified.
B00CWV8QKQ|5|Very roomy.
B00EVPRXCI|2|I got this in a 16w, but I don't wear that larger size but it was to small, so I sent it back.
B00N877SDE|5|This is a really nice printed hoodie.  This is a quality garment with a cool printed Batman logo design. Sizes do run small, so order one size larger, as the product description recommends.
B00ID45KBO|4|Im so mad
B00ABBPU08|5|&#34;Excellent&#34;
B00J4E2SDK|2|Thing ripped after only a week of barely any use.... I would like a another one or at least a refund
B005C9G8LO|5|FOTL boxers with soft waistband look good and feel great.  Not noticable shrinkage yet.  Am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00ART741M|5|I have a 36-37in waist and I got two pairs in 38 for leg room. They fit me real well and I'm going to buy more in other colors. I have a broad build so I can imagine that if you are slender you may need to size down.
B00PR3G4ZK|1|Scratchy and cheap fabric.  Hat is way too tight.
B003UYBA9S|5|For Christmas, husband asked for a porkpie hat, I never heard of such a thing.  I looked it up on Amazon, and there it was, It is nice looking and very well made.  He loves.
B008VPS580|3|Great fabric but they stretch out easily... Should have got a size smaller.
B008KKODMI|5|I was happy with the product. Worked great for my costume. It came in on time and it preformed like I thought it would.
B00IJJQ4VI|5|Beautiful, well made hat. Bought as gift for my boyfriend & he loves it! Fast delivery. A+ Seller! Thanks!  : )
B00GJONAJO|5|I really like the color of this tank and it fits perfect!
B000N8X56K|5|He loved them!
B007P6TCOW|5|very good product
B0036V0TL0|5|muy responsable la mercancia me llego a tiempo y sin contratiempo son recomendable 100% muy responsables y el precio exelente los recomiendo
B008R6WFKC|5|I love the way these make my feel feel in my running shoes.  There is a big difference from regular socks.
B004XYAJUK|5|Wonderful brand , fits  the figure of a 63 year old perfectly. Great product line, fit, fabric, style  sexy, pretty
B000J3GD3Q|2|Having been a Victoria's Secret customer since the store's inception, I finally got to the point around ten years ago where VsS bikinis became simply too rich for my blood and I started buying/wearing Hanes' Bikinis.  We move around a lot a and I found that a six-pack of Hanes typically has seen me through an entire overseas &#34;tour&#34; of around 3 years...so, embarking on another country this past summer of 2012, I bought a new pack of 6 in my usual size, at Target, only to discover (too late) that the sizing seemed smaller than usual (I know, I know what you dear readers are probably thinking--that the underwear hadn't gotten smaller; I had become &#34;bigger&#34;...well, I assure you this was not the case!)  Anyway, I ordered another pack on-line in size 6 (the next size up) and was dismayed to not only find that the prints/color palette I received were nothing like the image on Amazon but the quality has gone WAY DOWN on the fabric weight.  While I appreciate the new, logo-free band, the fabric is so light and flimsy to be borderline saggy.  My spirits too are sagging...undergarment comfort (and confidence therein) is one of those underrated things in life--sure, looks count but comfort is PARAmount!  Time too will tell whether or not these hold up for the average 3 years I expect, or whether I will have to bite the proverbial bullet and ratchet up my spending on another more ahem heavily-marketed brand.
B009O1QLDQ|5|I gave it five stars because this coat is pretty sick. I'm a woman and it looks good on me, and my boyfriend.<br /><br />BUT BE WARNED PEOPLE. The sizing is for Asian sizing, not American. So if you're a small, order a medium, and so on. I made this mistake, but I didn't return it because I'm pretty much between sizes. I realized that it would be too big on me if I got it a size up.<br /><br />STILL. Remember that. Otherwise, it's well made and very comfortable, I've gotten a lot of compliments. :)
B00A2IKJ5Q|1|Not so good.  Fabric was great, fit was awful.  AND they charged a &#34;return&#34; fee.  Will not buy from them again.
B00JYW7J4A|3|Cute dress and very flattering on my hourglass figure. Would definitely recommend it.
B0006U3ES4|1|Junk. Tops are way too small around and way too long. Cheap material will probably fall apart after first wash. Returned mine after just trying one on
B00EVXXPJU|2|Little on cheap side. But all beading. Mother in law liked it
B008RPY5AG|5|Beautiful!
B0030BNK4Y|5|Loved the product, but returned for a smaller size.
B00U061L70|4|Great case!
B00BI46C18|5|Beautiful mask!  I got many compliments on it!  Excellent quality!!
B00C1KAX40|5|Since buying this I have been nailing perfect 10 women every night.
B00I6CR76E|5|XLT as expected
B00PD8TEG0|5|Beautiful material  like a ling sleeve tee withba wonderful roomy torso  just orderva size larger
B00N9RFYV6|5|I really liked the blouse but they run small.
B00IV6DAZ2|4|Just what we needed.  Arrived on time.
B00JCU1T9U|2|The reviews and picture made it seem like the print looks decent, but on the pair I received, the insignia is very blurry and pixelated without even being worn. Pretty let down by this purchase.
B00N6QSS22|5|WAS A LITTLE DOUBTFUL THAT I WOULD GET AS GREAT AS A PRODUCT ADVERTISED AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE......BUT I DID. THE SHIRT ARE WONDERFUL AND OF GOOD QUALITY.  I WAS SO IMPRESSED THAT I IMMEDIATELY ORDERED TWO MORE.
B00LI5RDL0|3|Daughter loved it. Is a little big for her though.
B0006IMJ9G|5|Sizes definitely run small. Went with the other reviews and ordered larger than I normally would have. I am petite- 5'1 and 105 lbs and I usually order XS in other clothes. I ordered a Medium in Asphalt and it fit me perfectly. Not too snug and not loose at all. Extremely comfortable! I will definitely buy this hoodie in more colors!
B00J9APBXI|1|cheap s***
B0058OQO4E|1|These socks are smaller than specified. Does not work for my son size 10 mens. Would definitely not order again
B00DC2234E|5|Very rapid service. A great value for your prom dress. Thank You so much!
B00HWMXMNQ|5|I've spent a LOT of money on t-shirts over the past few years trying to find ones that work for me.  I've been through most of the name brand shirts, ya know the ones that cost $40 each, and still not happy in the long run.  They fit great at first but then lose elasticity or shrink or fade to pit-stain yellow after a few washes..  I usually get A-shirts because I can never find sleeves that are tight enough for me.... which doesn't make sense to me as I'm rather built in the upper arm area.  But I've been told it's not as classy with a dress shirt, and a formal undershirt is more desired.<br /><br />I'm a 44R 37 sleeve 16.5 neck and bought the large.  The chest fits well, the neck clears great with 1 button undone, and the arms stay on my arms and don't bunch up.  The material is thick, yet not hot.  I've only had them through 2 wash cycles, so i can't say they will last forever, but so far, these are my go-to and one the better bangs for the buck i've tried.
B002N3AMCS|5|I have bought 10 of these costeum and they are great for the money we spent on them.<br />They are exactly like the picture and made of a sturdy quailty. i am happy with my purchase.
B00MJVCG0K|5|very comfy!
B00IL64OXO|5|i love it
B00ABGD406|5|Perfect, especially for the price. They felt silky and my daughter was fine with them. She is 11 months and almost 18 pounds and they fit fine.
B005T5RFLI|4|Love it! Super comfy, great price. They seem to be a size larger than what they say though. I normally wear an XL but the Lrg. Fits fine.
B00OJSVLJS|1|The gloves are not leather, the fur cuff is sparse and the fingers are poorly sewn and misshapen..
B00EKB4KX8|2|VERY CUTE the 1st and 2nd time i wored them, but by the 3rd time, they were WAY TOO WORN OUT looking (and I even hand washed them) and stretched out.
B00CI1HXLI|4|It fits a little tight but I like it too much to return it!
B0007YWT30|4|Good quality and comfortable.  Came quickly and was perfect for our needs.
B00SKIZFUE|4|It's a really beautiful dress But runs too small. I'd recommend order to sizes up.
B00PCTQO5Y|5|Love it!!
B00IHM72YU|4|Very comfortable sports bra!!
B008G74I0M|1|Way to long for me. 6'1&#34; with super long arms but this jacket came almost to my knees
B00GVG1P3I|2|Runs very small and too tight across the hips
B0020ML3DE|5|they were perfect, thank you
B00IOGF804|4|Slightly poor quality, but cute overall =]
B00DTVUWEG|1|I purchased these as I've ordered and owned quite a bit of Eddie Bauer clothing over the years. However, more recently, their customer service and quality of product has started to go downhill. I ordered these via Amazon, feeling confident that I'd made a wise choice. Out of curiosity I went to the EB site after and realized the Amazon page had failed to detail the inseam length, which is 33'. Way way way too long for me. I assumed they'd be 30-32, and an extra inch does make a difference. I ordered these on a Sunday. Within 2 hours of my order I requested they cancel the pants. I didn't want the pants. Long story short over a three day period, which included a Sunday and a non-mailing Monday holiday, I made 2 phone calls, sent a private FB message, and submitted several emails on both sites telling EB associates I did not want the pants shipped because they failed to list ALL of the sizing information in the product description/and or sizing chart. I was told I would not be charged & assured by both associates that the item had been removed. Yet I still received the pants and have been both charged for the product and shipping. If I send them back I will NOT be refunded any of the shipping from what I understand. According to the EB creed they claim to guarantee my satisfaction. Instead I'm stuck with a pair of very long and slightly baggy pants that I hate. Exactly how many emails and associates did I need to correspond with in order to get what I asked for?! Epic failure EB. Be sure when you order you are sure you want the item as they're going to mail them to you no matter what.
B00328HRC6|2|I returned this item because the fit was a bit too small around the hips.  The legs were too long, but that could have been altered.  I did not see this item available in the next size.  If it is, I'm willing to try again.  I have a pair in size 18 and have been wearing them a lot.  Wanted another pair to alternate with.
B00ITMYAN4|5|This 2piece is great! The tank top underneath isn't connected to the mesh top, so it's perfect for mix matching!
B004SWJ3S6|5|Great jacket
B000B73YH8|5|The pants are made of good quality material.  Pants are very comfortable and haven't shrunk or faded.  I recommend them to all interested.
B00L2TH92K|4|Unique T Shirt, the fade look is really nice and it's a super soft cotton.  Casual wear comfort.
B00GFI2DSS|5|Excellent quality and service will buy again.
B00ESPTMKC|5|Had to return cause I need small size which they didn't have, however my mother like the pants
B000VK9TB0|5|Nice quality
B00UD33V7S|3|I loved the color off that bat. It would definitely stand out in my sea of black dresses. However, upon receipt it was very wrinkly and would not be an ideal travel dress. The fit was overall small on top (chest, under arms) but normal elsewhere. It is a thicker feeling material, and from the photo, it looked more flowy. For the price I would want a dress which travels better.
B0038LNUHS|5|These are a perfect fit, and are just the same as the other Jockey brand briefs that my husband has been wearing for years.
B00GY0YUI8|5|I purchased these leggings for my granddaughter. She loves them and the fit is perfect.
B00GGQSP3G|1|Poor quality! Waist is very large but tight every where else! Would not recommend! When you hold them up the waist is wider than the butt area! Weird
B009914A8Y|5|Review from eleven year old daughter-<br />These socks are amazing. I got them for Christmas, and they are easy and comfy to wear. I have been wearing them everywhere. I was so touched when i heard that all profits go to charity. My only complaint is that my father didn't get me more. :D
B008747VTE|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it for cold days.  It is a very bulky jacket but it serves its purpose.  You can make adjustments to it all over to make it fit just how you want it.  One really nice feature is the band around the waist on the inside.  You can snap it up and it keeps all snow/wet out of the inside of the jacket.
B00FM1YRE2|5|Funny shirt, very nice
B0011YS19Q|1|As one who LOVES Seven7 jeans, I was very disappointed when I received this particular pair . . . they fit great, BUT both back pockets (which have an AWESOME rhinestone design on them) were damaged.  I don't know if these were supposed to be a \\"destroyed\\" look, but it looks pretty bad to me.  This was definitely a case of getting what you paid for . . . it simply wasn't worth the money to ship them back (I had gotten the last available pair.)  I keep hoping that I'll find some sort of patch or extra rhinestones to cover the damaged areas.
B001KI9340|4|These pants are great for lounging or working out. They are super thin (slightly sheer) and lightweight. I have a 29\\" waist and 39\\" hips, so I got the large. I wish they were a little less tight in the thigh area, but that's my problem area, so that's probably just me and not the pants. The are just a tad long (I'm 5'2\\"), but I don't trip over them or anything like that. Overall they are extremely comfy, affordable, and eco-friendly. If you are curvy girl, like me, just be ware that these pants fit snug to any curve you have (My fiance likes that, so it's a win/win situation for me.)!
B002OTG5FY|5|Very cute onesie!! Good quality fabric and like the color.
B00LGUTKA4|2|The hat is great and seems to be durable, but as an UV protection for your face, it doesn't work, since sunlight can visible be seen through its fabric...
B00MPW406Q|3|My brother bought me the grey one for Christmas in XL.I tried in on and the top fits fine, but the bottom fits like a medium. Absolutely no stretch or give At all.
B00G9ZZI7K|1|The picture is nothing like the dress!  When I pulled it out it is of bad material and looks the size of a shirt. There is no stretch to it either.  Very disappointed!  Do not order!!!
B000WFH8H6|3|I feel for the price this was not worth it. It sits loosely and so it enhances any belly or back bulges you might have. I am a small and fit person, yet it made me feel bulky and out of shape. It is not solid enough to wear a lacy bra or any bra that isn't seamless. I actually prefer the Tanks from Old navy over this one and they are much cheaper. The &#34;perfect tank&#34; from Old Navy hugs the body in a way that is much more flattering. I will have to go back to using those until I find a higher quality brand that is actually worth the price.
B004DCAE5W|2|came marked 44/38on pant leg and 44/30 on waist and it was 44/30. Was not satisfied at all.
B00NMBRT6W|5|I love this shirt, it has to be my favorite sweater top that I have ever owned.  I can wear it with a skirt, nice pants or (my favortie) leggings and I look amazing no matter what!  I have the grey blouse, not purple, but same design, fit etc.  I would definitley recomend this to any woman with a sense of style who'd like to be a little more bold with their wardrobe.
B0037W6ZSE|5|Nice, big wallet. Best one I've ever owned. Quality product from Trafalgar, as usual, and it looks much better in person than in the picture. Considering buying another one since I do honestly feel as if I got lucky finding this wallet. So good.
B007N2MW0Y|5|Well the truth be known, I love it!  I did, however, buy it for my husband, who wasn't too sure at 1st.  He is now enjoying it and wears it everyday in the winter.  It fits into his jacket pocket when he is indoors....  Good purchase!
B000LJF9J2|5|This items is comfortable for use while running. I purchased it for my Zen Micro Photo & it fits well.
B0009MZTP0|3|The fabric was nice on these socks, but they fit me (size 12) a little tight. The fabric was also pretty thin, I didn't realize that when I ordered them, but the labeling read thin when I got them today. I guess I'll keep them, but be more careful in the future that I get larger than 15 x-large
B004O4JKJK|4|The product does everything it needs to do, and came in a timely fashion, but the first one I received ripped almost immediately.<br /><br />It seemed to have been defective, because the second one worked fine and still is, and I got the replacement quickly.
B001T6HAPC|5|While I had to try a few different sizes, it was worth the trouble. When your doing things through the mail it is very important to be patient. I tried this size and had that awful back fat thing going on. I went up to a D and it is a perfect fit. It's a very sturdy bra. Nothing frilly about it. You can, however, wear it all day long and not think about it at all. For a sports bra, it gives a very flattering shape while keeping &#34;the girls&#34; completely in check.
B0001CTZ8A|1|I tried to use this product two days after delivery as we were leaving the hospital.  Before I was pregnant I was a size 0-2.  I gained 40 lbs. during my pregnancy.  I found that even after the 40 lb. weight gain, 2 days later I was still barely big enough to fit the band.  Not only that but the top rolled down and made it extremely uncomfortable.  It also isn't very long at all...doesn't cover every area that it needed to.  Needless to say, if I remembered where my reciept was I would return this for a full refund...
B00MVYMMJU|5|good deal
B00AE1SK2K|1|Not a good product for the larger sizes...not even close to being able to fit. Plus there was no packing slip or return address?!?
B0037KLG2Q|5|Love these socks.  They are durable, yet soft, and my daughter loves to get ready to watch with Daddy the Aggies or the Cowboys play on gameday.
B00NIN2J4Q|5|Awesome
B00BNIBNRC|1|The tag on this says it's sleepwear, so does the label on the back of the top.  It's not a layering tee at all??  It was too cheap to send back, as I'm in Australia, so I guess I have a new sleepwear top.
B00I19JLPW|5|Love it! Perfect fit and works for causal to dressy outfits. Neckline is best part of this shirt!
B00CYKLEOU|5|I bought this for my sister's new baby boy and it's one of her favorite outfits to put him in.  It fits great and looks even cuter!
B003VVT3HQ|1|These are terrible thermals: they are poorly constructed, flimsy and ill-sewn, and worst of all, scratch and rough as sandpaper against the skin. Avoid like the plague.
B002KMJGJM|5|Looks good and fits perfectly for me. Nice light weight material for those warm summer days ahead. These pants look good enough for most any social situation....not weddings though!
B00B8Y28CK|5|Quality thick material and logo printing, fast delivery. A keeper!
B009E8FNHE|4|Granddaughter was so happy with her new pink jean outfit she wanted to keep the jacket on even in the house.
B00QHR2OD6|5|Perfect
B00J3YK21G|5|Love this jacket. Great buy
B00R1YJ1US|5|Nice sweater - have had for a while - couple of washes keeps it shape - fits well - looks good ... and the texture of the cotton is great - good purchase for $16
B008MQBPVW|4|Looked great with my outfit.  I was worried because they are clip on but they actually stayed on all night.
B00L1K43HO|4|This is okay looks a little different from what I expected however it is a nice top
B00AHOZO96|5|Was a bit skeptical at first but it was a perfect fit. Used the measurement guide provided by seller. Loved it
B00NJVSSH4|3|The box the gloves arrived in is marked &#34;One size fits all&#34;, not X-Large. The gloves are nice but they are snug which is why I ordered a specific size.
B007KMT6A6|5|A very nice quality sock with a nice longer length. A nice thickness for daily wear. Stay up nice. Very cute under my paints and fun to wear with my purple work shoes
B006WRHI32|5|this was a great Christmas gift.  very hard to find the real deal that ties  like the old  kind do.
B005S9GV88|4|good product...
B004J1FW8G|5|love it , fit as expected
B00CBMBDBK|3|Does not close in the front like it appears to in the picture.<br />I bought this to maybe wear as a wrap at my wedding...Idk if that will happen. Its OK. I shouldve just returned it, but I have been so indecisive with my wedding day accessories.<br />Oh well. Its not that bad.
B000ZHGBU6|5|Might be a little high for garters to look right when attached, but alone, they look good and feel comfortable.
B009OKPZWU|5|I'm an adult size 6, order this in the 9 since it's a junior fit. I'm also 5'7&#34; and going off another review from a taller person - they are longer which was a huge bonus! Thicker material than your standard leggings. Would buy more colors from this seller.
B00FY7VE9K|5|Perfect length and I'm a bit short. Fits nicely. Travels well. Although stretchy fabric it doesn't look cheap. Good investment.
B00C3CHTN4|5|Usually I'm a size xs. I'm currently pregnant and wore this with my 7 month pregnant belly. I'm q size c cup and the size small fit perfectly. If you like using smaller bathing suits this one fits right. I'm 5'4 and 122 lbs during this pregnancy so I'm petite. I guess if you have bigger boobs do order a size up but the bottom is really cute and small wear it if you like and are comfortable with small bottoms because your booty will show off! I loved it!!!
B00D5S562G|5|great top fit perfectly
B0046NCI70|5|Lil guy looked great in his outfit and still loves to play with the hat.  The material didn't feel cheap and we had a wonderful time for Halloween with this costume.  He got a lot of compliments on it and it lasted all day at day care.
B00G3KTWHS|4|Socks appear to be of good quality, They were listed as 0-12 months yet they were too tight for my 4 month old grandson. I will save them for our next grandchild.
B008DKBVZM|5|This is the best bra I've had in years, without doubt.  I have narrow shoulders and am \\"well endowed\\" so the combination meant constantly-falling straps and deep dents in my shoulders...all of which is very irksome, to say the very least.  This style of bra is built to accommodate narrow shoulders as well as lend superior support...a winning combination for me.  Life is again wonderful!
B00L3NBRUU|2|A really good deal and they look nice but the zipper needs to be safety pinned in place.
B009FV9KZQ|1|I EVEN ORDERED BIG CUZ ITS A SWEATER... BUT WAY TOOOOO SMALL.
B00BT0KJ88|5|Good quality
B00L64FTXM|5|Fits somewhat small, I got medium which is for a 33-34 waist. Nice feel and very comfortable
B00LO7ZDIC|1|Very cheaply made, didn't last a day until the buckle fell off.
B00DAX3X9E|5|stay very dry very fast carving on the beach I highly recommend it! I love this product, I hope to buy another piece of these
B00DBA31IY|4|I like the style of the underwear but the color is a little gawdy. The fit is slightly smaller than I expected but still fits relatively well.
B00LCD1R9W|5|Great product. Exactly as shown.
B00DOFR03I|5|A gorgeous special occasion dress for a girl.
B001DTXZJA|5|I needed this Knight helmet to complete my medieval knight collection. Although, I did not wear it during photography it was just what I need to complete that knight in shining look that I was aiming for.
B008MA4380|2|I have big legs so I am normally on the higher end of the L scale, so went XL on these and they fit well
B007IJ7932|4|I'm 41 weeks (yes, 41) and this top fits well over my belly.  I'm guessing that the torso will be a bit too big after baby comes, but it certainly covers all but I am only 5'1&#34;.  I like the support and the higher neckline. The only thing that is not comfortable for me is that the straps are a bit widely spaced and make me a little sore where the nursing clips are (this could be from swollen breast tissue, but it's hard to say for sure).  Material holds its shape well.  Happy to have it.  FYI, I'm wearing about a 36D and usually wear a medium and I ordered a medium.
B003WCEKHW|5|After reviewing the customer comments about these scrubs, I went to Dickie's home website to check out their size charts. Everyone defines &#34;fit&#34; differently based on the expectations and their body types. After reviewing the size chart, I decided to &#34;up size&#34; my order to give me room in my bust, even though it's practically a dress in the body. (I have to do this with any scrubs I try on.) I wasn't disappointed. Going up a size did give me a larger  bodice to give me a bit more room in my bust area and did leave a larger swath of material in the body, but I'm very pleased with these scrubs. I will end up taking these to my local seamstress to have some of the material tucked and shaped, but again I have to do this with any scrubs I purchase anymore. If you don't need extra room for any reason, stay true to your size.  Great fit, good construction, color was true to the chart. It was very fast shipping (from order to receiving was four days total) and the prices were excellent. Highly recommend.  ETA: these are wearing better after I had them altered in the belly area. Washing them has softened the material. Material is heavier than the Cherokee uniforms I have, but not so heavy as to make them uncomfortable/too warm to wear with a shirt underneath.
B00BFGAWBA|5|Fit great n good quality.  Taking the wear and tear associated with potty training very well
B00T6YYC8M|2|I am a off the rack size 3-4. These pants are acceptable but no way would a much larger size woman be able to enjoy these. They are super snug on me. Def. Not one size fits most as advertised.
B00I2HFE4A|4|Fits my 46 inch tall, 43 lb 5 year old well.  She's only used it a few times, but it seems to be holding up well.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because it is tight, which I guess it's supposed to be, but it is too hard to get on and off.  If there were just a little more stretch around the neckline so she could slip it on and off, it would be 5 stars.
B006IKQDDO|5|A great shirt...I love it.  Very stylish and exactly how I expected it.  I used the sizing chart and it fits perfectly.  This is not a shirt with a long tail...so it is a smart casual shirt to be worn out and with the sleeves rolled up.  Very happy!
B00CTH8CWK|4|This is a beautiful, soft and elegant dress.  My daughter loves it but it runs slightly small and she'll probably only be able to wear it for a few months.  She usually wears a 6 and 7 is slightly large on her but this size 7 fits like her size 6 dresses.  Buy up a size.
B007P0H9OS|5|A little longer than expected but not a deal breaker.
B004X19SW8|5|Even if you don't have fine, thin hair like I do, this hat can instantly makes you look great. I like the smaller brim because it doesn't overwhelm my short body and people behind you can see. It will be hard to take it off. I'm buying another one just in case.
B00890OCOI|4|The &#34;Laser Red&#34; jacket is really more of a deep hot pink. Pink is not my favorite color for my daughter, but it's still cute and I love the black and white trim. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
B007Z0ERFW|3|34 too small, 36 too large
B005HJ1OFE|5|Ralph Lauren has always stood for quality and these socks are no different.  They are very comfortable and last a long time without getting holes in them.  Very breathable and go well with dress pants.  Highly recommend them.
B00HX36CMM|5|I love it! Nice color & pretty sturdy for a college student with heavy books.<br />It came quickly & was very cheap for how nice it is.<br />Thank you!
B00HNPKF0K|5|LOVE
B00KSF6W68|5|really cute sweater. it's definitely oversized, i thought it looked like a fitted sweater on the model but it's baggy. i ordered a size too big, all good though. thick material too. can't wait to wear it.
B00J5UOTDK|5|Great product and will purchase from again. Thank you!
B00427V7SG|4|Very big on me but I'm only 5'1&#34; and 125 pounds
B00IR6M74Q|5|👍
B00LUZ6ALC|5|Adorable,  Comfy. Length is perfect for my short frame. Jeans are a little stretchy but not so much that they will get baggy and gross. Love them.
B001BY3SLW|1|i did not like this vest at all it looks ugly and it is too small definitely not a one size fits most I gave it to my 3 year old niece she loves it
B00KJ65ZX2|5|I get tons of compliments on these! They go with every boot. Product is just like the picture.
B00K0UC08K|5|My daughter normally wears 3t size clothing. Ordered the 4 thinking it could always be taken in but fits perfect.
B0042LJGUI|3|Hat arrived slightly crushed.  Regained original shape after opening but had minor tear on top where it had been crushed in shipping. Hat was too big. Needed some filler in brim to fit properly
B009B5O3EY|1|The sizing info is wrong which means the size chart does not help.Example a large is actually closer to 47 inches wide<br />instead of 41 as stated on the chart<br />The colour is not as bright as its shown in the pictures. Its kind of faded and looks slightly used or water damaged<br />The material is not what I expected from U.S. Polo Assn. clothing<br />I have another Dark Brown Polo of same make with the same pony over 6yrs and the colour never faded because the material is totally different<br />I will not recommend this product
B00SAIGXVY|4|Very lightweight fabric, but still keeps you warm.
B00VQZVF70|5|Fit nice Looks GREAT
B008Y2EUNO|5|Yes , telling the truth ... Absolutely , no comments .... No words to explain the power of this shirt ....
B003HC92M0|5|Liked them - so I turned around and bought a couple more packs.<br />Nice cushy bottom feel and my feet don't get as hot from what I was wearing. Seem to slide in/out of my boots easier.<br /><br />Tried a pair out of the package and was a little large, but the wife washed all and now the fit is fine for my feet. Looking to see how they do when the summer temps approach triple digits.
B002R0FF88|5|Excellent quality and they look good.
B005CSNVU6|3|Runs large
B005EVRRQ0|4|These were exactly what I was looking for: right style,right material.  Alas,wrong size.  And not available in the size XL.
B00EZX1XGS|4|fits great
B008P0CBIG|4|The frontal picture is exactly accurate, but what I didn't realize was that the back G-string was thick, nearly 3/4 inches! Certainly a great fit, and sexy, just be aware!
B004PEI4Z0|5|Very cute, nice material, true to size - my daughter loves it! It is very pretty and is the perfect cover-up with a ballet leotard.
B00FS9B2O6|5|I love Cosabella.  Very well made, beautiful fabric and the sizing is spot on.  The peachy pink is perfect under so many of my dresses.
B000MND796|1|There wasn't any elastic in the waistband so they didn't stay up at all.  I have purchased these shorts in the past and this pair was definitely not of the same caliber as the older version.
B00IJZZMCO|5|Excellent!!!
B00PZXG6YQ|5|The color is a deep rich green. The material is thick and holds its shape. I would buy this again.
B00IVD3P64|5|Couldn't be happier with it!
B00CYHQOTS|5|Looks just like the picture and is completely adjustable...everywhere.  It's fabulous.  I couldn't be happier with the product, how much it costs, and how it arrived much earlier than expected!!!!!!!
B00BC0AWFK|5|great, it's the same one i got from target last year.
B00A0HR48E|5|My almost 3 yr old wanted a bikini. It is a silly thing to do, but I got this one and she is very pleased. I am not sure her mother is. She put it on over her clothing as soon as I brought it over to her, and it was very cute.
B00KD5AXDG|5|Very nice. Got them for a baby shower.
B00VOTSA4O|2|What ever size you wareyouhave to go up a size. :( I got mine yesterday and it is too small. BUT IT GAVE YOU A FREE PAIR OF UNDIES!:)
B006C9A120|5|Love this shirt. Hasn't faded and fits me well. I've only worn it a couple of times, but absolutely love the office, great way to show support!
B00JRRKSWM|5|👍🏻
B001CK8OTG|5|This looks and fits great on my wife, she's an A-Cup though and approximately a size 2.  We love the colors.
B00BZ60ELI|5|I had fun wearing this costume.  I really like the fit and the quality.  I was expecting the usual paper thin costume for the price I paid.  So I was surprised when I received it.  I can definitely wear it again.  Highly recommend.
B00249GIUQ|3|Thanks, but not such as I expected in accordance with the description.
B0098AAYAO|5|Great fit, great look
B00M4LJCBG|5|I love this tank. I usually wear a medium, but after looking at the size details, i went with a large. I'm happy i did. slightly big, but after washing, it was perfect. and super cute!!!
B008VT4NRS|2|I am 6'1&#34; 200 lbs and always wear an x-large shirt. x-large shirts usually go to my pants pockets in length and the shoulder seams go right to the tips of my shoulders. This shirt is embarrasingly small. Lengthwise it goes to the top of my buckle. Widthwise it is about 1.5 inches too short on each shoulder. It looks like I borrowed a 14 year old boy's shirt.
B00B8QP58W|5|pretty
B005JJ34Z0|5|love this full sleeve little girls leotard.  fits as expected and is a nice soft material with vibrant color.
B001KZBYQI|4|I ordered a 2XL and what I got was barely a single XL.  Be Warned !  The sizes run very SMALL.  Other than that, I liked the quality and the fabric very much. I just have to lose that 20 lbs I've been meaning to lose for 10 years so I can fit into this shirt ;)
B00DQTNHWU|3|It gives a moderate lift to my 32AA breasts. I wish there was more padding in the bra but it was not that bad. You would really have to  pull your breasts together to get cleavage.
B005D60HEA|1|have other 3 Dot tops and loved them ...this looks and feels very cheap<br />will return it ASAP  very dissapointed
B000RDMSG4|5|I ordered this hoodie for my daughter who loved it!  The fit was great.  The hoodie was not a heavyweight, so she is able to wear it without getting too hot.  Thanks!
B006OPSR5K|5|Best shirt I have ever seen
B00RL8QG6Q|2|If you're unhappy with the suit or it doesn't fit are we able to return it ?
B004SNJB4Q|5|I always like the feel of these Van Heusen shirts and they fit well for my nephew sho has a hard time finding shirts that accommodate his 18 1/2-inch neck.  I'd definitely recommend this seller as it arrived very promptly.
B00LY6A2XO|2|It was too small dont use your regular size here. Try to use a larger size
B008EENXNA|5|Pants look great.  I am 5'11, normally wear a 31/32 waist pant.  I got the Large (US31) and they fit perfectly.  The pant legs come very long.  As other reviews have said, you need to bring them to a tailor to get them hemmed.  Definitely not a deal breaker since thats the case with almost all dress pants.
B008EKN5R8|4|Great price and seems durable! Love the grey trim it help break up all that blue! Would def buy another color in this top!
B003ES51KY|3|I have about 5 of these bras that are a few years old. This one now has a clasp in the back. Which is ok. Better than other designs from a couple of years ago, this one is very padded under the clasp and doesn't dig in. But this one is much more constrictive around the band. It can be uncomfortable.<br />I previously purchased 32b, 32c, and 34c of the shock absorber pump. This is a 32d and the shape has changed dramatically compared to the others. Maybe its just me, but I just dont like it as well as the older ones, except those dont fit.<br />So this is fine, and I'll continue wearing it, but I'm gonna start looking for the next good sports bra. Problem being, looking for another good custom fit sports bra that makes a D cup without being set up for huge boobs.
B009K08AJ4|5|Beautiful
B00NQEQX6W|5|Marakesh Leather belts are the most quality belts I've found. Each one is crafted with care and the designs are beautiful. After buying belts from Marakesh Leather, I could never buy from anywhere else.
B00NOFLBCE|1|Super small! I ordered a large and had to give it to my 13yr old niece... poorly made, stitching is horrible
B008LUGX0W|3|They do run small but that does not matter to me because if I'm wearing a oversized sweatshirt or short dress it looks perfect. So I do love them!
B001PTGB0S|4|The trunk will boost the back, but the hip brief boosts the front.  Of the two, I like these trunks better.  More comfortable, and there's nothing special you need to tuck or anything like the hip brief.  You just wear it as you would any other pair of underwear, and the built-in elastic straps do all the work.  The resulting \\"boost\\" is also better with the trunk, IMO.
B0018OMNFW|4|Nice belt but buckle, while handsome, is a bit flimsy for the image it attempts to present
B005WUMU8I|5|The shirt is light weight and comfortable.  It does a fine job wicking moisture when I work out.
B004TQHTU0|5|Thick, good quality material. Size - as expected!!! I'm a bit surprised
B008P4FYAY|5|I have been looking for a new blend of cotton weave for my husband t-shirts.  This one is perfect and I love the thick durable material with pocket short-sleeve one in white. I thought I start with hardest to keep clean and see how is washes and dry . if I get a shock after the washing I'll update post. Otherwise, I highly recommend this to men who like a t-shirt with body..it's not see through!
B008HZD78M|4|Good price.average quality.
B001PTGN8S|5|The items I bought my son for school was just as said and the fit was prefect. Way to go, thanks, you made my shopping so easy since I can't get out.
B000TAADTO|5|I can't tell you how many partial bags of new tube socks I had as my husband would wear one pair and then find something that he didn't like. He loves these socks! That's the best advertisement you can get right there.
B00W6RSKCU|5|I bought a size 4 for a girl that wears a size 5 in cloths. The bottoms are a little loose on her but she is tiny. The color and quality are good. I have washed and dried this once and so far I haven't had any problems.
B00NNECJ9K|5|My high schooler loves these stockings.  They are cute and she gets lots of compliments.  Happy with this buy.
B009XD3FL6|5|I love this scarf! I bought this for my mom for Xmas and she loves how it is not too bulky and has a great pop of red and is soft!
B00DW430TE|5|It looks great, fits well and my son says it is warm. If came at a great price too. Just what we needed!
B00EKZN8DW|5|Perfect addition to a costume.
B000IBH7IY|5|Great buy. Higher end of this brand. Not cheaply constructed.
B00AZGUZ40|5|Fits great and washes up well.  The length is good and drops just above my knees.  Would like to order another one in a different color.
B00PQ641KS|1|Disappointed in the size. Especially for the price.
B00QNU9T80|3|Super cute, good quality, just runs a little small
B007EKQ7QU|5|I have been wearing this brand for years and they always keep my ears warm! Comfortable, adjustable, and keeps your ears warm. Totally recommend!
B00BJAXFWU|5|Love it! Medium fits tight, but its stretchy enough so fits very snug though. Not sure how it will look once washed, however, the design is sooo cool. I am happy.
B002ZAPJY0|4|Everything about these gloves works well for me.  The length covers the wrist, the finger length is right and the size is large enough without being baggy.  The cotton works well for handbell ringing and I am hoping they will hold up well after washing.Thank you.
B009ES4SKM|5|I wish I had ordered two.  It has a nice weight to it, just the right size.  It looks good on my jean jacket along with my other patriotic pins.
B00AKIPDTA|5|The garters are beautiful! And she went above and beyond to add a personal touch that made it extra special.
B009RZYRTY|5|Very comfy . Fits perfect . Will be ordering more. And the price is great .they have all color I like too ...
B004QXW4X8|3|The t-shirt looked nice, but it had a very strong chemical odor that made our eyes burn. Hopefully a wash or two will take it away.
B00QGUX74E|5|i bought this as a gift for a room mate and i am absolutely thrilled with how it looks on her and she loves it.
B00KHVCGMW|5|The granddaughter wore this one for her first day back to school. She loves the way the skirt twirls and fit her perfect. Had to order another one for the other granddaughter. It was a huge hit.
B00B82T136|5|My niece loves this outfit!  She doesn't want to take it off!  She loves Minnie Mouse!
B00PHDT6XM|5|Fits perfectly & covers my bottom.
B00IZ89MT4|4|Nice  comfortable shirt
B00HU0O4DC|5|beautiful
B00CJTBXLU|3|I wear a 34 waist in all my other pants and its a little tight. I put these on and they fell right off! No worries, that's what a belt is for...
B00J2WJ3G4|5|Very very cute and sexy style I bought small  it Fits perfectly on my perfect figure !
B000NGMMCU|3|Product seems good, but my hands are not strong enough to pull them up - and these are the lightest tension.
B009IJY6PO|5|I love this pants, great material but next time  I'll order it in size M because. Really cute pattern and comfortable to workout it
B00M2HQ8XC|1|Very poor quality, cheaply made top is one long strap you<br />criss cross like a long bandage no support ugg<br />very disappointed, can't possibly wear in public
B00KOKZSSU|3|not great quality stiches, part of the waist ripped right as I was putting it on.
B00D9CNF0S|5|Great item. Different colors. Beautiful.<br />Not happy about the shipping charge of almost 20.00 when i purchased the required amount spent.
B007HMGDX2|5|Just as expected.
B00OPX65XE|4|material not as expected , bit small but buyers should buy a size up
B00U1VLAXY|5|Kgood
B0016U0BFW|4|What's to say? They are black socks that fit and wear well. I've had them for some time with out any wearing or holes.
B00COVUK12|1|its a very bad pice. Do NOT BY IT!!!! Rips on it when it came and very itchy! DO NOT BY IT VERY VERY VERY BAD AND PRICE!!!!!
B00H36UJ6E|4|Great color. But was just a bit larger than expected. Unless I lost some weight then even better!
B00FEDI1AY|5|Thinner material than I expected, so not a sweater than you would wear if you want warmth. A little more black and white than expected, as the picture has a bit more sepia to it. But fits my friend great and she loves it! Got lots of attention.  haha.
B007JPMVSS|5|Comfy and decent quality for the price
B00BRN7EYO|5|Great product! Very easy to get on and off of an infant. I really like the zipper.
B001LNZFYQ|5|My son was Ring Bearer for the FOURTH time this summer, and as such we had to have a tux for him to wear. This is the 4th separate tux he's had, as each time he's just outgrown the previous one enough to warrant a new purchase. Because I know (all too well!) that he will only wear it one time, I hated to spend $75 plus. I found this tux and decided to give it a go, as it was half the price of the other one I was considering. This turned out to be a GREAT decision!!!     The tux showed up within 2 days, much earlier than the quick shipping date that was listed, and the tux was perfect!!!! It is good quality and ready to put on and wear. Because we've had 3 other similar tuxes, I know that the quality here is equivalent to other brands and companies out there. No, it isn't designer material. But, it is everything you need for your little guy to look super adorable! It includes everything you need and is perfect for the wear it once (or even a few times) and don't feel terribly guilty getting rid of routine. I would recommend this product from this company to anyone!!!
B00CQH1AL8|5|Love this jacket.  I wear it everywhere!  Where I work out is very cold and I keep it on for the first few workouts and then I take it off.  Love it!
B0065Q0TOU|4|Well, the quality of the coat is great. I just got mine in the mail today, the package was a bit strange though it was covered with a brown stain. I opened up the envelop and was welcomed with the huge scent of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce it was definitely pungent. I take the coat out of the plastic cover and it was drenched with what ever this stuff was. I'll give it a good wash, just hope the stain that's on the chest of it comes out. I would order another one though. It fits really well.
B003IBEC7U|5|This is by far the cutest costume ever and it will keep our son nice and toasty while he's out with his sister.  The costume itself is well made and has snaps to make it easy to change diapers.
B00N72YJMI|4|I like the shirt and the seller delivered on time. It just runs small. I will wear it as a layer under other shirts now. it is too tight too wear alone.
B00NB54T62|4|Perfect
B00ED3727Y|5|I ordered this dress very last minute for a pin-up photo shoot, in the hopes that it would just be *something*. When it arrived (and it did so very quickly!), I put it on and OH MY GOD it was lovely! It fits like it was made for me! It feels like it's a real dress, unlike some things I've gotten from Hot Topic, etc. It's the perfect length and looks positively adorable with a petticoat underneath although it's absolutely not necessary. I have every intention of getting this dress in every color!
B00Q4JWF0Y|5|I'm never one to post comments but thus suit is great! I highly recommend it to plus size ladies
B00NF9NICU|5|I love this swimsuit! I was somewhat concerned about how it would look on someone with my body type as I have full hips and thighs. In fact, I typically wear swim shorts or a swim skirt. Much to my surprise, It looks amazing on me! So glad I made this purchase! I highly recommend it!!
B007MFVUTG|5|You won't find a better quality hat of this style anywhere.  Coal makes good hats.  Most of which I just can't justify the cost.  The quality outweighs the price on this one.  This hat exceeded all expectations and is one of the best purchases value/quality-wise I've made on Amazon.  BTW, you might be concerned about the &#34;mustard&#34; color of this hat.  I'd call it &#34;gold&#34; and it looks pretty good.  God Bless you all.
B003VDHXHG|5|love these, pretty and practical.
B00I068XQE|1|Didn't like so hard to out on. Not good for me.
B00O10432Q|5|Fits great! Can't believe the price. Thinking of ordering more.
B00OL11MHY|5|It really works, and keeps you cool.
B00KJJODD2|5|A tad too long but I can fix that.
B00PAI0H14|4|The fabric feels wonderful on my skin but its definitely not as baggy as I hoped for it to be. I do like them though.
B000922W3C|4|Im 6'4 and normally 36 inseam are long but these were so long i had to cuff them. No complaints here..
B0074DAHWC|5|Nice quality beanie, looks great, and you can't beat the price. I should have bought all the beanie colors. Next time!
B00L8WBAYE|5|I am 5'4'' and 123lbs, 32B bra. The small fits great. The cups are a bit far but I think the overall fit is great. If you have a small booty, go down in size. Love this purchase!
B00BUCXOPA|3|Just wish it was not so wide.
B000N44X3S|5|Wanted naughty. Wanted see-through net. Wanted tiny-micro barely there. Got just what I ordered! I need all the colors now! (I don't like the picture how she has the strings so high up on her waist. You can easliy low ride the strings on your hips for a more sexy look!)
B00B4WTFJ0|5|This dress fit perfect and looked beautiful. The flower needed some reinforcement as it came off but there was no damage. My daughter got a million compliments and I couldn't have been happier.
B00RLB0FZG|1|This item comes from China so the sizing is very small compared to US sizes. I ordered an XL & the shirt is comparable to a US small- medium size. I normally take a size 10 -12 and there was no way this was anyway close to it. The quality is OK for the price but you can't return it because the cost to ship back to China is cost prohibitive. If I had know the sizing difference I wouldn't have ordered it. As it is, I plan to give it away to someone who can fit it.  Update as of 4/4/15, I have been contacted by the seller a number of times pleading with me to remove my review. I won't change the fact that the sizing is deceptive but I was willing to update my review if they had processed a full refund to reflect that they had in fact refunded my $$ without my returning the shirt. That did not happen, they initially compromised with a $5 refund which doesn't do me much good but I guess it was better than nothing. It couldn't even fit my 11 year old granddaughter who is 5&#34;6&#34; & 95 lbs! She couldn't even bend her arms! I ended up donating it to Goodwill. At this point I'd recommend to anyone NOT to buy from this seller!
B00M3QS8BW|4|I love these hats. They are comfortable and look cute with any outfit. Keeps my head nice and toasty!
B00QSTJQNO|5|I ordered the XL because I like clothes oversized - it is very light weight - I like the way it hangs in the back - way longer in back than front its a much better look for me -  those that hang longer in front and short in back - looks silly to me
B00T61DC4K|3|it's alright for the price...
B00CXQYIA2|4|A little tight when pulling them on...but they look good and they hide my cellulite! Very sexy cover up at a great price.
B00D37OQT8|3|Not authentic as they say, but its ok
B00BBW575E|5|very comfortable
B007R8P46S|5|Several years ago I tried Wright socks and I've never looked back. Threwaway all my cotton socks and my feet are much happier even in the summer heat. The only sock I will ever buy again.
B00DXD8IQO|5|They feel really nice and comfortable on, and are true to size. Extremely happy with my purchase!
B00NHNO3T6|5|Any REAL Sherlock fan will love this!
B00KJQXP98|5|Very nice set.
B00191SB9G|2|Belt is poor quality leather. cracking and coming apart. No bargain.You get what you pay for.
B00FYEWURS|5|I love these pants.  Material is substantial and not to thin.  Runs true to size, not to small at all.  I will buy another pair in a different color!
B00F1CRRW6|5|Hard plastic, good size, arrived exactly how described. Perfect product, helps me feel safer when I walk to my car, etc..
B009YD6ICI|4|Good quality pants however they do run small. I would reccomend getting a size up. Maybe even 2 sizes up.
B0095YCPUA|5|This dress arrived earlier than what the tracking said. I love it. Very flattering, and soft quality material. Just the right length too. I am 5'6\\", and it is just right. Also like the color.<br />Thank You!
B00GCGVIBQ|5|Love the image in the front. This quickly became my favorite shirt.
B001K2L4MU|3|wish it came just a bit larger.
B0088LMPJC|5|A surprisingly very good quality shirt. Non- shrink material, and high quality graphics. An overall great value novelty sci fi type shirt
B00EUWO4H4|5|If you are fan of wicked the musical. I recommend to buy this issue<br />i'm very glad, i like so much
B0051D8IJQ|4|I really like the texture, the overall fit, and feel of the jeans. I also liked the petite length. I am 5'2&#34; and the medium length is way too long.
B00FVZGNVO|3|The waist is huge for my tall skinny son. It has elastic but it's not tight.
B00LXAPTIY|5|i love it
B005SZFA0M|5|Perfect fit & durability!
B00JSC2POU|5|This skirt was exactly as described and it fit as expected.  I am 5'4&#34;/140 lbs/40&#34; hips and it reaches two inches below my knees. I wanted a plain pencil skirt and it comfortable.  The material for this black skirt is lightweight but thick enough to be opaque.  Can be worn in the office or casually when paired with complementary clothing.  I cannot speak to what it would look like after a wash but I can certainly say that the material is a magnet for dust particles.  It was a good purchase given the sale price.  Update: I recently ordered the Olive Ladies Cotton Stretch Fold-over Waist skirt.  This order was cancelled by the seller.
B00CC84FHC|5|Perfect when you are just looking to smooth things out a little! Very comfortable for all day wear. Washed and dried mine on gentle and it came out great! The back does not go up as high as the Maidenform Shapewear, which is great when you don't want it to be seen under your clothing.
B00E89WKJS|5|very cool stuff to wear Product quality is superb very soft and original stuff Really love to wear this Fantastic
B001L84BX2|5|Love the shirt but is smaller than expected not too much as I still wear it but not as comfortable.
B00CJJ6AYA|5|come on 31st !!!! woot !
B00C7OL7WM|4|I loved it .... very good ... :)
B00JKW99KG|5|Awesome buy
B002NPCIQE|5|My son loves these.  I got these for him last year when we began potty-training around age two, and he loves them.  I like the soft material (cotton, yay!), and leg bands that don't seem to ride up.  The best feature is the super soft, totally encased waist band--no exposed elastic to dig into skin and leave imprints, and no itchy seams next to the skin to scratch or irritate the skin.  Also the elastic inside is a very gentle elastic--very easy for him to pull up and down by himself (which is great for potty training!).  What's also cool are the colors--solid, dark colors perfect for boys, and no ugly patterns.  (Nothing's worse that getting a dud in every pack--but no duds here!)  Overall, these are the best underwear for our young boy!
B00NPC6JSW|5|Nice!
B003YY5MN4|5|These hose are so pretty and they fit and hold up way better than I ever expected.  I cannot say anything about longevity, because I've only (so far) tried them on.  However, they are smooth and silky and well made, so I would expect them to stand up to a few wearings, at least, the same as any pantyhose would.  Very nice quality and the sizing is as expected, about mid thigh for my average length and size legs.  Thank you, Hanes, for a great product.
B005MHGKSC|3|I only bought this coz it was a add-on. The colors are soft and it's worth the price I bought it for.  Product arrived on time and pleased with the service. Looking forward to use it.
B00CXMISDE|5|The colors in these Trendy Multi Color Glitter Fashion scarves just can't be beat.  They add so much bling to my wardrobe when I wear them loosely over a single colored shirt, sweater or jacket, plus they are not heavy and bulky....I think I have every color!!
B00PA13UQA|3|Buy larger than you think you need
B00ZRVEVCA|4|Great skirt for the prices. Fits as expected and washes well.
B00GG0QMKU|5|Love this hat. As other have noted, it feels a little large, but it stays put nonetheless. I think that's a testimony to its high-quality construction. The band is designed so it feels as though you have nothing on your head, but the hat stays put. Fantastic.
B00IXYE61O|5|My daughter is very happy with her new pajamas, which is good, because they will probably fit her for several years.  Quite long sleeper.
B000QWDQVC|5|I bought this product for my wife i got her an x-large and it fit as expected she has only had it for 2 weeks and is already on the second set of hooks and she doesn't really workout or anything like that she just wears it all day! so she will probably need a smaller size in a couple of weeks so i say that this product works great! The pic is the day she got it.
B000EGI2KK|5|Love these mountain Tees.  They are the correct size (some shirts say they are large but seem to be smaller).  They keep their size in the wash.  Also, I love the coloring.  It never shows a wrinkle.
B00CM4QC5O|5|This is a beautiful scarf.  It is sheer and lightweight.  It has a herd of zebras galloping across a soft blue background.  This is easily big enough to use as a sarong or cover up.  So pretty and the seller offered excellent  customer service.
B007NE7LX0|5|I purchased for my mother and she loves it. She says it is comfortable and it fits well. We would purchase this brand again.
B004B3HQSQ|5|I love this hoodie so much. It fits good. i get so many compliments on the hoodie.
B00FRQ5EHG|4|I love the shirt! I ordered a large thinking my size medium girl would be able to grow into it and have it for a while, and before washing, it fit smaller then I expected. Super cute top though!
B00C600PLG|5|First I bought the one in charcoal color to try the fit and how it would pass the washing and drying test.<br />well The fit is great and it passed the laundry test it held its shape did not shink.<br />so I decided to buy the other color as well.<br />I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B00ZCIFE1A|3|Love the swimsuit but it wasn't actually size
B00FUHWR22|5|They fit perfectly not see throught at all. I normally wear a size 0 or 1 in Womens and I'm 5'5. I got them in heather gray. Love them.
B0097BEN06|5|The color is not harsh yellow nor is it too pale. The fit is true and comfortable and I received my merch in  a reasonable amount of time. The style is exactly what I was looking for in a thong. The price was mind blowing for the item. Great buy all the way around.
B00IO64API|5|Good quality, comfortable, and have held up well through several washes.
B00PHMKY5M|2|it says womens sweater dress but is to small and to short
B008MLBVB6|4|Nice looking hat and pretty warm as well too. Well made and a great quality of the product anyway that's for sure.
B005EOL6DW|5|It was amazing to deal with u the items was perfect and no damages on them but I hope to deliver it early next time  the size mentioned medium but it shows it's large
B00BXZGFDW|4|Very adorable with the matching longline bra, it makes you feel like a 1940s screen siren. It does not, however, have a full bottom, so it does ride up a bit, but not much and it is higher-waisted than most modern women's pants so it is best under dresses, but if the skirt is tight enough then the buttons poke through.<br /><br />Despite those negatives, the only negatives, I really love these panties. They are comfortable and make you feel like Greta Garbo or Rita Hayworth. Totally worth it.
B00HVJ23B2|4|It fits great and I like the color. Would recommend it to anyone. Not a talked, nothing else to say?
B004UMFR8E|2|Shirt seems to be made from cheap material & not true to size! The adult small does not fit my 13yr old.
B002K6F7AK|4|This bra is just ok. The fabric isnt that soft but I wasnt expecting it to be for the price. It fits ok right now but i still havent had my baby. I hope it is comfortable enough later on.
B00GOLF1IA|4|These pants were a little long, but otherwise fit well.  My husband needed something lightweight for Physical therapy after hospitalization. These filled the need very well.
B0029F269M|5|I love this hat. Fits perfect on my head. I cannot wear most hats. My head is not big but it is odd shaped and this hat fits perfect. Will use in the yard working in the garden and at the beach. Great Find!
B0080BLVD6|4|Not a high quality product, but felt soft and does what it should. Not sure how well it will look once washed. My 2 yr old is a true 3t, I got the smallest size and it fits just right. If you want more use from it, you might want to go a size higher. Again, not sure how it will hold up after continuous use and wearing.  My little girl couldn't be happier having princesses on her leo, though.
B001H0FCB4|5|My mother in law has looked for these since She lost one of her gloves 5 years ago. None of the stores carry them. I am so glad to find them on amazon for her. I bought her 2 pairs. She is thrilled. They are great for driving.
B00EFG6ZHC|5|Got to love it right.
B00FZR19OE|5|Fits good
B00I4DKH1M|5|Loved the color, style, and comfort.
B00O8LIM3O|5|Very comfortable and warm for those cozy winter nights around the fireplace.
B00CTJW9HW|5|Every one i know, either says its cool, or its dumb. IDGAF either way, this coat is very nice and i love it, i wear it alot, took me a while to get used to it, used to cause me to sweat, but now im used to it and its nice and airy
B002JIO2ZK|5|Amazing wallet
B00FPKHO7C|5|Great shirt...im 6ft 205lbs. For the most part I wear a size large. I ordered an XL bc rash guards tend to run small and it fits perfectly. If you are borderline on sizes in normal tees out for a size up for this product
B00CBTXYNI|3|The XXL is 3 sizes too small.  the pic shows the inside color on the sleeves is a coordinating color but it is not. It is exactly like the outside shirt color. There is really nothing special about the shirt.  The pic shows it gray colored but it is really blue.
B006ZH89B4|5|for those who want more of a basket these are perefect.
B00FYV84ZS|5|They fit me perfect and are very comfortable. I'm 5 ft 2&#34; and about 110 lbs, I do think they would be too small if I were much bigger.
B0056405PA|5|I usually buy my uniforms from a store where the prices are much higher.  I was worried about the quality of these, and I was pleasantly surprised.  These uniform pants were the same quality as the higher priced ones.  I will continue to buy these pants through Amazon.
B00FDSTGBI|5|I love crazy T-shirts and this one fits the bill! I like that it's a little oversized-- it's more comfortable that way. It's nice heavy cotton and I love the purple color--very nice! I'll purchase more when they add more comical sayings! :) I love  shopping on Amazon! It is a fabulous site!
B00BPRPXYU|5|nice price.  It is a nice quality outfit.  good value.
B00LV5C9Y8|5|Beautiful and unique.  Nobody has one of these beauties around here!
B00BR03ROS|5|I love these pants. Very comfortable for the job, durable and they last a long time. And I use them everyday and they don't shrink when you wash them or loose shape. Great Product.
B00BM0RHKI|5|adore mine it's so cozy
B003VVPVZ4|5|Arkansas rarely gets chilly enough for long johns and when it does these are nice to have; north of the Mason Dixon line...not so much.
B0018MBVTI|2|Let me first state this: This model, Loose Fit,Double Knee w/ Cellphone Pkt has been discontinued by Dickies. I knew this going into the purchase,but I work for DSNY and found them to be the best work pant I ever wore and figured going online, I could find some sellers who still might have the surplus of this existing model. What I found is that of the 9 sellers who have advertised this product online, 7 stated they would be taking the advertisement down, as they don't have the item anymore.<br /><br />So for those whom like myself,are searching for this &#34;Near Extinction &#34; product,I advise you to contact the seller prior to purchase, and verify its availability. I'm currently going thru a RMA process with a seller outside of Amazon, because of my failure to verify that the item was in stock.<br /><br /> Some of these sellers IMO, don't carry the item any longer,and are purposely misleading customers, in order to get them to buy something else, once they have your money.<br /> With this particular seller here at amazon, I was told that USPS sent my order to the wrong address.I have no reason to doubt that explanation,of course. The 2 stars are for customer service which was prompt, courteous and helpful. and RMA was expedited.<br /><br />Again, a warning to all those looking for this item VERIFY ITEM IS IN STOCK 1ST !
B00GHGDGR0|3|Lightweight and stretchy in hips, legs, and butt so its great for multi-sports (jogging, volleyball, kickboxing, cycling).  Fits about an inch larger than true waist size.  Pocket on right hip is big enough for keys and wallet but not much else.
B00IVDCDJ4|3|Cute suit, but be aware that the back of the bottom is much smaller than the picture shown indicates.  This is way  more of a brazillian cut than other scruch butt suits that I have purchased.
B004Q2RI80|4|Fit as expected and shipping was fast. Highly recommend!
B000M9O4JM|4|I purchased the medium size.  It did shrink some in the dryer.  The fabric is similar to what's on a long sleeve t-shirt: thicker than regular t-shirt but not normal &#34;sweats&#34; thickness.  The medium ended up being about 36 waist and 32 endseam roughly, which is a little bigger than I wanted.  The draw string waistband is really cheap.  The pants still performed well for me, so I would get it again, just in a small.
B00M31HUUW|5|Cute!  Love them so much I ordered another pair!
B005DTB67E|4|good quality, however it was a bit too large.  Hard to buy clothing when not able to try on.
B002X0QUCC|4|I didn't expect this to be a several-hundred dollar suite.  Fact is, everything is fine.  I had spent over $100 on tailoring and now it fits perfect all the way around.  Custom tailored suit for about $200.
B00CMXZE6I|4|This one is a good buy. It's cloth is not a cheapo, it feels good and soft. Not too thin and looks durable.
B009ERSRDM|4|The dress arrived much sooner than the expected delivery date.  It was expected to be delivered between June 23 and July 10, but it actually arrived on June 5.  That was nice!<br /><br />As far as the dress itself, I am about 5'6&#34; and the scoop neckline of the dress is slighly higher on me than it appears on the model in the picture.  The dress is also shorter on me than it appears on the model in the picture.  I'm honestly not sure if I would have bought it if I had tried it on in a store, but for the price it is cute and I will make it work!
B002R0FG8W|4|I am very impressed with the quality of the Capezio outfits. I feel I have gotten the most out of the money I spent on these.
B003MP9C2M|3|I bought two pairs of jeans, one in 'wanderer' and one in 'indigo affection' which doesn't appear to be available anymore. They fit nicely, a little slim around the ankles. However, 'indigo affection' had a pre-worn pattern on the butt and front legs of the fabric. I would get these weird squarish wear patterns on and behind the back pockets, and finally they ripped, while out in public no less! Didn't even notice until a friend pointed it out. I'm sure I gave more than a few people a good eyeful of my underwear ;). Now I'm very cautious with my remaining pair, checking for any trouble spots.
B00KDHHLDE|5|very good
B00Q5XFG0U|2|Very cheap. The eyelets are already coming loose after a couple of wears. 👎🏻
B00KAL6NIC|5|I am a size 4, ordered a medium, and it fits just right. This cardigan is on the small side, so if you want a slouchy fit,or  more freedom in the arms then order 2 sizes up. But if you want a &#34;just right&#34; look, then order a size up.
B00EPG939E|3|I expected that a pair of &#34;small&#34; socks would be just right for my size 6 1/2 narrow feet. Unfortunately, that's not the case at all. There's about half an inch of extra space at the toe.<br /><br />Furthermore, these are labeled &#34;sport&#34; socks, but between the extra length and the thickness of the fabric, these are not comfortable to cram into my sneakers. I can't really use them to work out. They're not at all right for that purpose.<br /><br />However... I'm still glad I bought these socks, and I wear them pretty frequently. Why? The thick, warm fabric and the extra space at the toes is just perfect for lounging around the house. They're also more colorful than I thought they were, which is definitely a bonus for me!
B000MXIN3Q|4|Front pockets too shallow, otherwise great.  Have used these pants for years.
B00H7H8V8C|5|The sizes were right on the money. Thankyou. Shipping was faster than expected.
B00OY6ODAO|4|This is a nice lightweight robe.  I only wish the sleeves were longer.  They are 3/4 sleeves.
B00QAPSOGG|5|Ordered large according to reviews and what I got was perfect. I can hardly wait to wear it! Love the lenght
B005TNP3M8|4|is really an article of good quality, colorfastness and are flexible and comfortable. You will not regret buying it.the green is a bit misleading but not that bad.
B007WA4CZK|5|Purchased as a Christmas gift for my friend fits her perfectly and the size on the title is true. So if your not this size don't buy it and try squeeze in it.
B0026P4648|5|Arrived on time and fits as expected.
B00MV5WFAU|5|Love love love this suit.  Fit perfectly
B00HOFFG6M|5|My husband is enjoying wearing it. Med/lg for a typically med size wearer was just right. Fabric is nice, not too warm for our north FL climate. Wasn't sure since was from Canada. Color more dark navy than in picture but looks good with the red trim and not as dark as black would be.
B00NSS3DYG|4|comfortable
B000PHK0WG|5|It's hard to find a nice white short sleeve dress shirt for hot summer days. This shirt is well made looks great and fits well.
B007SWRBCS|4|The shirt it is a great looking, well fitting and a quality material shirt. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that although the description says surged bottom I missed it when ordering and don't care for that look.
B00HJ9JS4E|2|Too short not made for person 5' 10&#34; or taller rides up on stomach
B00BXRMVWY|4|Beautiful dress and lays nice..worth the money
B00O91GJG0|5|Children loved these, said they were the most comfortable ever age 7 and 9.
B0044FP2IM|4|would this be appropriate for a 10 year old girl - OR is it more for the younger girls
B004R7JI8M|1|Black were to small  but the charcol fit perfect
B007I4HJEG|5|I ordered this shirt for my grandson for his birthday and he loves it.  Wears it all the time. The colors are great and it washes and dries perfectly.
B004P8CJ02|5|I LOVE JUST AS IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE.ARRIVAL JUST AS THEY SAID PACKAGED GREAT EVERYTHING WAS JUST AS THEY SAID IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE
B001A47UWG|5|I was looking for strong, good looking jeans. What i got, great color, perfect texture and excellent price. Highly recommended.
B00BPEO718|5|These socks are great!  Wonderful gift idea for any Whovian!  I originally bought these for my mother for mother's day but just had to have a pair for myself as well.
B004I766BS|4|the color runs even after the second and third wash!  I really like the length of the shorts and they are very comfortable.  I got three pair ... navy ... the dark pink ... and the coral.  I washed them separately as directed two times and the colors bled and the navy faded.  Then I washed the pink with some other clothes and the pink bled onto my other clothes and this was after two or three washes.  So buy them because they are comfy but be sure to wash them separately!
B0070ZARPQ|5|Excellent product.
B008704XKS|5|the quality is good. I would recommend it to my friends and family . Love it would buy again from the vendor
B003JOKSCO|5|the skirt was a snug fit, the spandex stretch made the size very flattering on me I am loving this purchase!
B004QU5GH2|3|Looks like it would fit a 6 yr old
B00DN1PJFE|4|I bought these socks in cream & black.  I love them!  They are really cute.  The socks fit well & don't get pulled down into my boots, and they are warm.  I would buy these again for myself or a gift.
B00HWQI854|2|They arrived quick and were cute but broke after wearing them 4 times. Not completely unexpected for the price but not good either.
B00HE61SIQ|3|The zipper is a cheap one that works hard.  Hope it lasts thru the summer.
B007OSH4N2|2|These were not as expected..they didn't fit well and weren't as soft as i thought they were. The pants looked great online, however, didn't look the same in person. I returned it!
B00CJ79UQW|2|These socks are very thin and tight on my legs small on my feet too.  They are also sheer.  My wife and daughter like them.
B00G9XM37A|1|I learned it the hard way from past 2 transactions with Crazy Girl Collection ordered an 8/10 (uk 12/14) this time.  It's TOO SMALL; it is SMALLER than a S/M I ordered from this SAME  Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, and Confused Collection.
B0017KA5OS|3|It is a bit loose fitting for the size. It feels fine, sexy, etc.<br />It holds up well in the wash. After a few years, I have to say that the \\"Groov'n\\" brand undies are the best I've found to date. No other can support a large sack like those.
B003AIKY9G|4|Very soft and comfy.  I would recommend this onesie to a parent.
B00B9PWC42|3|Ok quality, but definitely thin in quality.  Will be fine for summer but extremely thin.  Great if you live in a super hot climate otherwise purchase something else.
B00BMZT55I|5|This jacket is perfect. It's cute and the price was AWESOME! I can wear it on a quick trip to the store, or my favorite...wear it over a pink cami on those nice days on the bike that have a lil nip!You can't go wrong with this piece. I have had several people compliment me on this jacket. It's one of my favorite in my closet!
B00KX1VVUO|5|Just what I needed for my dress to wear to a wedding. Very cute and great price.
B00GJ3I450|5|I bought this robe for my son. The robe is thick, very soft and comfortable. This item is very nice quality. Blue color looks very bright and nice.
B00PB6K3PU|4|very pretty but snug
B00LJNBHBS|5|Simply adorable.
B0015MNSJ2|5|Perfect fit & the face on the shirt matches my husband's face in the morning 😆
B004491OA8|4|This  looked a lot like a medium sized make up bag. But is much smaller than I had anticipated.  It  also looked like it would be plush and wasn't. Not worth the wait.
B00LJWDUM8|4|I also assumed that the Fly Front indicated a zipper, but it is in fact all buttons.  The material seems of good quality, but the coat does shed the first few times of wearing it.  Overall I am very happy with the unit at the price that I purchased it at and it does seem like it will last me for a few of the winter seasons here in the Northeast.
B00HTYBT2S|4|It fits smaller than described.
B00LVHGOQU|5|Great jeans! Fit couldn't be better.
B00HG7HLE8|4|Sleeves are a little short, but it was worth the risk. I live in Houston, Texas so I have not need to invest in a high quality coat. This does the job.
B0013K7BT4|5|I really liked it!
B009SZE8VA|5|Our class purchased these as a Halloween surprise for our Zumba instructor.  Well, we liked them so much that now we wear them every class!  It's fun to hear the jingle so we're more likely to shake, shake and, in turn, get a better workout!
B00E8D78NM|5|I will probably order several pair of these, because they are amazing for me, and fit well.  My hands are too large for most girlie gloves!
B0088MI2JS|4|I like this coat and I can be a stickler:<br /><br />Here's what I like:<br /><br />* The hood is convertible. When not in use, it folds back to form a super-warm collar. (It would have been nice if there were snaps or velcro to hold hood the in place when it's functioning as a collar, but this is a small quibble.)<br /><br />* A snap flap conceals the full-length front zipper. This helps to give the Spiewak Bennington more of a coat-like as a opposed to a parka-like appearance. To me, this makes it more businesslike and suitable for the office.<br /><br />* There are elastic bungee cords that allow you to adjust the waist and create a less bulky appearance.<br />* Clever stitching at the waist and back also works to reduce the bulk of the coat.<br /><br />* The two side pockets zip, so I'm less likely to lose my keys.<br /><br />* The cuffs have a stylish design and each has a snap that allows you to adjust the sleeve length, if necessary.<br /><br />* The fill is 80 duck down/20 feathers. (Most coats I've seen in this price range are 60/40 or 50/50).<br /><br />One thing I didn't like about this coat was the color. I ordered it originally from Amazon in Black, which was a lackluster shade. I then re-ordered from another seller in Northeastern Fog (A color that most of us would describe as dark charcoal -- it's a more fashionable better color -- it feels fresh and smart.)<br /><br />To sum it up, great coat.
B00GRWIRBO|3|I haven't purchased this item.  Reason?  I searched plus-size clothing, and although I see this comes in size 18, there is no realistic way for me to know how this would possibly look on me when the model is so thin.  I don't understand why supposed plus size clothing is shown this way.  I refuse to buy plus size clothing shown on skinny models.  The only reason why I gave this 3 stars is because I thought it was very pretty.
B00EG8NA2W|5|I love these keychains great quality very nice detail well worth it if you are an Attack on Titan fan
B004DPY7EI|2|I am befuddled at best by the Alpha 1968 MA-1 I bought recently. It's made of beautiful heavy nylon, it's well sewn and it has a nice heavy zipper. but it looks NOTHING LIKE an original Alpha 1968 MA-1. This jacket's pattern is WAAAAY too long and the sleeves are bizarrely skinny! Also the windflap starts an inch down from the collar and the waistband is sewn in with no tension at all- so there's none of the original's high tight waist. I think this is a Japanese pattern (the little zipper ribbons seem Japaneesy) and sadly the jacket is made in China. I don't get it! This is Alpha- why can't they just literally use their old patterns and materials and make some REAL 1968 pattern MA-1s right there in Knoxville? They probably have all the right materials still in stock! It is sad to see such a once-great AMERICAN company sold out to the global market with all its lack of quality and offshoring of American jobs. Only fashionable young people should buy this jacket- if you are looking for and exact reproduction DON\\"T BUY THIS ONE!    Added Note:- I recently saw photos of a USA made Alpha 1968 MA-1 from a few years back- the US made jacket IS correctly proportioned and a very exacting copy of the original. Alpha- come back to the U.S.A.! Make those great old jackets HERE!
B000V6YS3I|5|My mother LOVED this! She had been looking for a new night gown, and I got this one in purple. The color is bea-UTIFUL! The length is perfect too, it goes to the ankles. My mother could not be more happy about it!
B007WPMA54|4|Dress is very nice, good quality and great fit. But it is very short. I'm 5'9&#34; with long legs and would be hard for me to dance or sit in it without leggings/tights. Still thinking if I want to keep it.
B00HMCYUT6|4|Fit a bit big and is too long.
B00CT9TML8|3|These fit over my daughter's shin guards, but barely. They will work for the season, but I wouldn't buy them again. I'm glad I bought 2 different pair for her to wear to games because these look like they will fall down (although, to be fair, they haven't yet). they are also sort of thin--they don't feel like a quality knit. They have pilled after just a few washes. But they are fine for a kid learning soccer, OK for practice.
B00J9REQ64|2|I ordered a large but normally I'm a small/medium. I was hoping it wouldn't be too big, but I wanted it to fit loosely. They look and fit like a size Xsmall.  Disappointed :(
B001G2UDXK|5|Well made and good looking.
B00NFC90CE|4|Nice jacket for a good price
B004VSQEJI|5|Got this hat for my step-father. He loves it! The style of it is perfect for casual wear, and, he wears it for dress at church. A beautiful hat.
B00LWZCK1Y|3|ok
B00KMDSD4U|5|The dress fits perfectly.  The smocked top allows for expansion if needed.  The smocking also works great at keeping a good shape on the skinny minnies too.  Cute dress!
B00FR6K8FY|5|Is perfect for the office, is light for the summer and the colors are amazing, I want to get it in other colors ...I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!♥
B000VK2G88|5|This is the best fitting bra I have ever worn!  I shopped at malls and bra specialty shops and could not find a bra that did not contain underwires....so I shopped on Amazon and found the Glamorise bra and decided to take a chance and order 2 of them.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  It is extremely comfortable and looks great under all of my clothes.  I will be ordering more!  My bra search is finally over!  Thank you Glamorise!
B00OO7LDB0|5|I love this.....it was pricey but worth it for my granddaughters 2nd birthday.  Just as gorgeous as the picture when it arrived at my home.  Thank you.
B00G2S1J3G|1|I ordered several of these cheap plain beanies. I got this supposed teal color which is really a blue color. I emailed the sender that I'd keep it and order another teal as long as it was teal. She told me she couldn't do anything about it.
B0011MPJB6|2|I bought these for my wife. She complains about them. The bra keeps slipping down and she has to keep tugging at it to bring them up to normal level.    Simply not that good.
B00NURBXF6|5|Not great quality, but if you tuck the shirt in, no one will notice. You'll only get compliments :)
B0079TRTZO|5|Nice
B001V7MVNU|2|Well I though I was getting different shades of zombie flesh but the picture is deceiving...It's just one vial of green makeup. Hopefully they update the picture on this posting so people don't think otherwise. But the makeup however did help a little for the zombie costume and the liquid latex.
B00K78G306|1|this is nowhere near a long swing dress, IT IS A CROP TOP, it does not measure more than 12 &#34; below the bustline, wrong description, wrong picture, do not go by the picture showing, absolutely awful
B00IGRBS3C|2|Is not according my expectatives
B00P87V25C|5|Absolutely lovely. Colors are excellent and material is neither to thin nor too heavy.
B00S4SO3NA|5|Beautiful color and love key hole detail
B0051BZ9N6|2|I'm 5'7\\" and 130 lbs and purchased a size small.  The product does not stretch vertically so although I'm not very tall, I'm tall enough that its too tight vertically.  It gives the dreaded camel toe and although I'm not well endowded it tents out from my breasts and makes me look shapeless.  The arms are really loose and over all the whole outfit looked terrible. The cat ears are ridiculously crooked.  Even with a belt it is just too it is just not flattering.  If you are short and a little thicker it would probably look great.  I think it wouldn't tent out if you were short and not too well endowed.  I'm pretty disappointed and will be returning it.
B00IMB2LRY|3|Fits well, chestplate is a bit too big but will look okay if you keep your shoulders farther apart.
B00MUZEGDK|5|This is an extremely hot product! I ordered it as a surprise for my husband and he was pleasantly surprised!
B005JA8P0S|5|These socks are soft and comfortable.  Will be buying more for the new school year.
B00RD68EAC|5|Really flattering fit.
B00RU0Z2LK|3|I ordered up a size so we could have room to grow. My son is 7. He is tall and skinny but average size compared to all his friends. I ordered 8s thinking they would be plenty roomy. Since they were washed they are almost too short. I am returning the other pair for a bigger size. I really like the look and feel. They washed well too.
B0081SLVRY|4|I really like this shirt - as others have said it is very large ... even for mens sizing.  I normally wear a womens 2x so I ordered this in XL and I should have ordered a L.  I do recommend it though.
B00265IQE4|4|Costume fits nicely and material is good but the starfleet logo and rank insignias don't match the photo and are lower quality than advertised. That being said I'm okay with it and it still works for me.
B002HMC0ZM|5|I bought this for my soon-to-be-born granddaughter.  It is adorable; it is soft, well sized, well made and will look good on.  The pieces allow for variations in temperature as well.
B00OPQX2KA|5|Product looks like I am a hanger. I used the sizing chart and measured myself. I'm 5'6&#34; 145 got an xl. Just order your regular American size. These are not Chinese sizes. Other than that, cloth is thick and stable, no flimsy stuff here. Will slim over most curves and hide imperfections. Floofy part is right at the knees, and the bottom of the dress is not tight enough to actually make you wiggle, a blessing in my opinion. Buttons are secured well, none of it is cheap, as I've seen a lot of online shopping hand out. Will be buying this dress in a more appropriate size. I wish I had a sexy secretary job, cuz this would be a staple in my wardrobe. Has a little bit of a stretch to it, so I'd almost recommend ordering a wee bit small if you are between sizes. Oh, and it seems the length of the dress varies depending on how big the dress is on you and how much of you is comprised of curves, so it will vary from body to body.
B004GB4SCA|5|Fun gift!
B0089C1DRA|5|I ordered 2x, I'm a fluffy woman, got XXL.  But they fit perfectly.<br />The discounted price offered is good, same great quality.<br />Don't order smaller than your slimmest shirt size.<br />With these 3 Ahh Bras I can just feel cool, and covered.<br />Here comes Summer...nno problem....got it covered!<br />Its Amazon, you can't fail!
B00HV6LY2O|5|great prices
B00ET1V0B4|5|Very comfortable! I bought these only because I needed some comfortable workout underwear (ones that didn't give me lines in my workout pants like boy short-type undies do) and NOT based on them being cute. I was only going for comfort here...and they actually are pretty cute (the printed ones anyway). and they are SO comfortable...Probably the most comfortable underwear I've ever had! I think I'll buy another pack!
B005JQWGFM|5|These are very nice panties. They were made well. They look and feel great. They were shipped inside a plastic bag which was a nice touch. I will buy more.
B001DNZ0AI|5|Used these as monsters crawling through the water for our Haunted airboat ride they looked awesome.  Stuffed the head with newspaper in a shopping bag then chicken wire in the body.  Worked great!
B00174G4GC|4|comfy. looks as described.
B008M9VJBK|1|Whn i received this jacket i was very pleased.  It looks good. It feels very lite weight yet keeps me warm when the temperature is down to forty. Unfortunately the inside seam frayed apart within a month and i started leaking feathers.
B0038ZNLUA|5|This dress was fabulous! It's cute enough to even wear in the summer as a sundress. It fit very well at a size 18. A pretty good at 20. And very snug at 22.
B002G9UDG4|5|Like this shirt. Just warm enough for me but not to warm .
B003CN0SV8|3|Extreme cold, seriously, I do not agree. Cushioning is sub par as well.weak
B00H56RXXE|5|VERY cute. I loved how the size was a bit larger than my own body size! It is nice fabric, too!
B001KYB4SW|2|I was intrigued with the general concept underlying the Scottevest clothing line, especially the ability to run headphone wires from pockets to your ears in a hidden yet functional manner.  While researching this shirt, I found it difficult to find a good review of this particular feature.      The general quality of the shirt seems to be good.  I'm happy with the feel and (from my limited experience) the durability of the fabric.  Nothing inside the shirt (including the collar loops) rubs my skin uncomfortably.    My criticism is that I found the product description on the Scottevest website to be misleading.  In the \\"Key Features\\" section of the Scottevest product page for this t-shirt, two separate bullet points are given:    1)  Personal Area Network.  \\"Our Patented PAN system provides a network of hidden conduits to connect wires to devices while they are in your pockets.  All products (including our pants) have some form of PAN...\\"    2)  Collar Loops.  \\"These specially-positioned loops hold your earbuds in place...\\"    Scottevest claims that all of their products have some form of PAN, and PAN is defined as a \\"network of hidden conduits\\".  But there are no hidden conduits on this t-shirt.  I even emailed Scottevest about this, and they (quickly) replied that there are in fact no conduits in the shirt.  Headphone wire management is limited to the collar loops and holes on the inside of pockets.  I hope that Scottevest wasn't intentionally misleading, but now that they are aware of the problem I would like to see them make this point more clear.    The headphone wire management (collar loops and holes in the pockets) did not work for me.  My earbuds pull taut through the collar loops so that they basically aren't long enough; there is no slack and the wire pulls the earbud out of my ear if I turn my head.  I also found that even with the weight management system there is a visible sag in the shirt if I put my Zune HD player in the top pocket.         The bottomline is that the shirt is comfortable and the pockets work for very light, small things like cash, a couple credit cards and a small amount of loose change.  Electronic devices like MP3 players and phones don't work because of the wire management system and the visible sag in the shirt.  I imagine that the heavier shirts Scottevest sells might be better for electronic devices.
B00VF0MQG0|5|I absolutely love this shirt! Reasonable price and it is adorable! Fits like a dream and is SO SOFT. New favorite item in my closet! I will definitely buy from them again. I've already seen more shirts from Housebroken that I want to order! Can't wait to get a pitbulls for peace top!
B00HVVVGN6|5|excellent boxer briefs. fit is perfect!!
B00OS2N2EW|5|I love this hat and have received many compliments on it. Fairly priced and well constructed; I expect this hat to last for several seasons. I have a hard time finding hats that fit larger sizes; this one is perfect.
B00VJWIB04|4|Very gorgeous swim suit, but size is not true to American sizes. Very disappointing.
B00BCWHW2E|4|I like this shirt, despite the fact the maker should be banned from Twitter. It took a couple washes before the material relaxed enough to drape well.
B00BMDC18S|4|My son wears a 2t and this almost didn't fit him. The hat is a little tight but it does fit. The costume itself does run small. It fits, but just barely. It is pretty stinking cute though!
B004QMLQYW|5|Very well made shield - big enough to look great for our 5-foot eleven-year-old as Captain America.  So well made it is now hanging on his wall next to some superhero posters - so a Halloween costume item with an actual second life (that's hard to come by).
B00E6OMX1U|1|Cheat looking, did not meet expectations
B000QW6LE6|4|Workung great so far! It's comfortable, does not roll up or move around very mUch,  if at all, easy to hand wash,  durable, worth the money. I like mine so far and have been wearing it for about 10 days.
B00M6FPTVC|4|Love it!! Just a little snug but would definitely recommend if you're an office fan! Got a compliment on the first day I wore it out !!
B0027UXDEG|5|These worked perfectly couldn't even tell I was wearing them. I will definitely buy more. Very happy with this purchase.
B00ULUN5LU|5|This dress is very nice. The colors are vibrant and fits perfectly.
B0080HGVWG|5|Just a beautiful vibrant scarf with a variety of colors that accentuates any casual outfit!
B00NG8EEQY|4|Beautifull.
B00BUQMF74|5|I love it,it's a little on the light side but its good and its lined so its ok, I would recommend it .
B00282KOYK|3|The mask is scary the material is good it fits adults perfect well at it least it fit me good.<br /><br />Only thing is quite hot when wearing.
B001A40CT4|5|Got some new Footjoy golf shoes from Amazon.  First time I wore them using my inventory of low cut socks, my feet were irritated, particularly around the toe box.  A friend told me about high end performance socks, like the Wigwams.  I decided to try a few pair, even though they are expensive compared to most.  Wow, was I pleased.  These are no doubt the best, most comfortable socks I've ever tried--no discomfort marks whatsoever in my golf shoes.  Sign me up!
B00BWPQISA|4|I am 6' and wear a small. I laundered this dress according to the directions. It became several inches shorter but thankfully not narrower. This dress is beautifully constructed. I wear it as a casual dress inasmuch as it is too short for me to wear comfortably to church. It was below my knees but is now above my knees.
B00UW0A8CS|4|tgese were perfect after a wash and dry. When they first came in I tried them on and they were too baggy to look like a jogger but after I washed them they were perfect.
B0085IC6EC|5|Good job, great purchase slow ship
B00LPHT3G4|5|Love the shirt
B00916LET0|5|Bought these short for school for my daughter. They fit nicely and look very cute on. My daughter is a small and we ordered the 3.
B008P8MLOC|4|Fits a little snug for a small, I usually order all my shirts in small, this one however, fits pretty tight. I would suggest a size bigger if you want a little room to breathe.<br />Color isn't exactly like the picture, although, it is a nice light blue.
B000QW6LHS|2|I received the product quickly and in good condition.  I started putting it on and initially though I'd maybe ordered one size too small since it was REALLY hard to get the clasps together (and if you've got a furry tummy like me, expect to get some hairs ripped out in the process), but as I worked my way up, it seemed to get easier.<br /><br />Once it was on, it didn't seem to offer as much back support and toning as I'd expected.  After about an hour of wearing it, I found it had actually become fairly loose on me, which I think was just the fabric relaxing a little bit.  There's a second row of clasps to make it tighter, but from the description it sounded as if those are supposed to be used after a few weeks as it kinda re-shapes your body.  In other words, I realized that I'd actually gotten a size too big and it really should have been a lot tighter to begin with.  Just to test that theory, I used the second set of clasps and after another hour, again it started feeling loose.<br /><br />Since there's such a huge variety of body shapes and this is essentially a generic hourglass shaped piece, how sizing will fit one individual to the next will probably vary greatly, so I originally was going to just exchange the one I got for a smaller one and see if it performed any better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I noticed once it was on is that there's about a 1/4&#34; piece of fabric that extends out past where the clasps are.  Once all the clasps are fastened, I found that that strip of fabric rippled... and since it's made out of a fairly thick rubber/cotton, that rippling was quite noticeable under even loose shirts, therefore it couldn't be worn under clothing without being very apparent.  For that reason alone, I decided not to go for a smaller version and just opted to return it for a refund.  When doing some research before purchasing this, I noticed that some versions of these have a zipper, so once all the clasps are fastened, you zip up the front to coverthe clasps and (hopefully) smooth out the front completely.  I'd assume that feature would camouflage it under clothing better than this version which just has a small flap of loose fabric covering the clasps.
B006PGGJOE|5|Exactly what I was wanting. I wallet that doesn't crush my credit cards. Not so good if u like to carry a lot of cash but perfect for what I was needing.
B003ZA0EOE|5|Perfect
B00H8QYSUW|5|Super comfortable and fits to size.
B00JTQBQR2|2|Item didn't fit. It isn't for a curvy busty person. It kept riding up. Wellmade but I don't recommend it to someone with a bust or hips. I'm petite and it made me look like I was a size 14. I am a size 6.
B00I48A8RU|1|Really disappointed with this scarf.  The fabric is super thin, and it snags easily
B00I0EYCN4|5|Just what I wanted.
B00NJL0JNK|5|This jacket was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law. She loves it, the way it fits and the warmth.
B003MAJK0G|5|These jeans are great if you have a short rise and would like your jeans to come right under the waist. The rise is perfect, not too low and not too high (like in Levi's 512, which have a very high rise or Levi's 523, which have a low rise).
B0055FFM94|2|Too small
B0018SN5EG|5|love the costume, fits perfect. I'd change the hair, as the top part flips down and looks a little silly. the material for the dress is a nice warm felt. but the necklace seems a little to fragile. i was scared to try it on before Halloween afraid it may snap.
B00CSO2R34|5|I love purple and fleece, so I love my scarf. I already had a blue one, so I knew this new one would be warm and soft. They also do well in the washing machine, too.
B005P1Z1GC|3|Just tried this.  It fits at the bust, loose-ish at the bottom.  I've had a baby so happy its not tight/overly fitted.  It is a long body(i consider myself short-ish/average trunk length).  I am usually a UK 10, sometimes UK 12.<br /><br />Not actually used it at the beach or pool yet, hence 3stars.
B00K05LAEA|4|Great pajamas. Wish I ordered more. Very hard to find sleeveless pajamas for  little ones. I give them a 4 1/2 star. Fit well but could have been a little bigger.
B00SLCRYUS|5|I love this light weight rain jacket. The color is just beautiful, it fits me, absolutely would recommend.
B00NGGYPBK|2|I ordered what was supposed to be above my size yet the jacket is still too small. It's a shame, I like the look of it, too bad it doesn't fit.
B00550QM2A|5|I am thrilled with this bra. LOVE it! It really is very comfortable and I forget that I have it on. Hard to say for a bra!
B00PNWRDL4|5|Super comfy, no panty lines, no ride up. Smooth, soft, stretch material.
B009DZDNW0|5|The Lederhosen is well made.  I've worn them several times and in fact I am wearing them right now for our first Oktoberfest of the season.
B00AW0LH50|4|Wore this shirt during the Super Bowl and I got lot's of compliments.  It is quite disappointing thought that companies who make t-shirts for woman assume that we are all shaped like prepubescent girls, but it is what it is.  I just wash and not dry it in the dryer.
B00JM76GAK|5|These pants are awesome! I love them. I will be ordering another pair or two for sure.
B007K9A6DU|5|Easy and comfortable. The cloth is good as well.
B00JGZI016|5|I received this wallet on the 17th of January 2015, and ever since this has been my go-to wallet. This wallet has 3 slots on one side, with ample room for credit cards and I.D.s. The strap on the opposing side is very sturdy, and will support a small and large amount of bills. The hold is tight, and after six days of use my bills have not come loose or fallen out. And it is made of genuine leather, as the title suggests. A perfect choice for anyone who desires a small wallet that will hold both money and cards. Measures 3 3/4&#34; wide and 3&#34; tall. A sleek and stylish wallet that fits almost anywhere. 5 stars.
B000U65YE6|5|Good stockings. Bought them for my wedding it fits excellent (I'm 103 lbs). So everything was ok . Thanks a lot
B00SG3VAK2|1|Very small very short not as described in listing different then shown in listing measurements not accurate will return the item for full refund for all three of the same items
B008GE1NKI|4|I ordered this coat and really love it but it's a little too tight across the shoulders.  I wanted to exchange it but it doesn't come in a bigger size.  Very disappointing.  It is a great coat, nice and warm as well.  Well worth the money.
B00MPNCILO|5|Excelent
B00MIRWLCS|5|Really love it!! I would get a second one highly recommended
B002Y408UC|5|I have a very large head and this ushanka fits me perfectly in the XXXL size. Construction is of synthetic fibers and seems to be 100% military issue. They ties for the ear flaps may need to be reworked with a black shoe lace - but no problem if you can make a couple of stitches. This is an extra warm hat for cold climates. Thanks, Olga!
B0009MZTEQ|5|These have been my favorite socks for years and years. Sports athority no longer carries the basket ball which are the longest socks thoro makes. But no problem finding them here at amazon. They hold up well over a year. They don't fall down at all even after a year old. These socks are worth the extra bucks. Instead of buying 4-5 packages a year of cheep socks I can buy 5 of these socks and they last forever. Never been disappointed
B00F2V7COY|3|They fit except for the leg length. I'm not tall, but I usually wear a 33 inseam. To have these go to my ankles, they would hang down in the crotch.
B00ACIFUP0|4|Very good T-shirts that have stood the test of time for me.  They still fit well after many washings.
B00M3G2GOW|5|Very nicke product!
B009MOYHPE|5|Perfect for occasion
B00DJRCIHO|1|I bought a 32 but it doesn't fit right and my body is small but the garter belt and bra feel like a medium. The panties are nice though. I don't recommend buying this if you are a small. 20 bucks gone to waste.
B00UC9M2IW|5|Wonderfully comfortable!!
B006BNQ3O2|5|like
B000LKETWY|4|Very nice.
B0093ODD4Y|5|great pride
B00IDHFZG6|4|I really like these capris. They're a good price, a good fit, and the right length (I have large calves that just won't permit some of the longer types of capris out there. The material is the right mix of smoothness but still plenty stretchy. I use them for yoga and for running. The seams aren't chafing to the point of causing holes so far. The waistband is the right width and height to stay where it needs to during yoga positions. I first got a pair on clearance at TJMaxx, but I'm so glad I was able to find them here, too.
B00BLXMK76|5|i love this sports bra! i am a 42DD and this bra keeps my girls in place while working out and running
B002LMSHO6|2|Ordered the british khaki pants and somehow received the branch pants. I purchased the same exact brand/model/size pants that I own (sized 36/34), tried the branch pants anyway and they were too tight. Sent back for refund. This was my first shot at purchasing pants online. I guess it's back to the store for me.
B0006IJA34|5|I now have this slip in white and black. This is the best slip ever....no lacy front, good sturdy straps and it fits and feels like a dream....
B00BV2T5E8|4|Perfect fit. The inner lining could be better though
B006DTJXKK|1|Horrible, la talla xs es enorme. De p&eacute;sima calidad. El mismo d&iacute;a que lo use se rompi&oacute; en el dobladillo. Se alienado los hilos, el,corte del escote es demasiado largo. Horrible.
B003Z00CNM|5|These handkerchiefs are a great value.  They wash well, are soft and keep their color.  They also contain the biggest sneezes.  My husband and son both like them a lot.
B00GV2G45Q|5|Perfect !
B00AZGGBIY|5|I was very happy with this costume. It was reasonably well made and pretty - not tacky like another one I bought and returned. I got a lot of compliments on it. The headband was a little small, but I added a little extra piece of velcro and it was fine.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that although it's described as peach color, it seemed more pink to me. This was fine - I prefer pink
B00B6E9QMC|5|Quality shorts which fits perfectly.  The price  point for these shorts are insane, will most definitely purchase a few more for the summer.
B00LPQV2MI|5|My mom loved this shirt! She is about 5 3 in height and 130 pounds. She said the shirt was a little snug, but other than that she loved it. I would advise washing in cold water and hanging up to dry so it does not shrink or purchase a size up. I purchased a medium for her.
B00JFJMLBI|3|Good shirt tag is annoying only downfall I'm tall and the large fit fine
B003XCZFYI|5|Got these for my granddaughter.  They fit just as expected and she looks adorable in them.  Would definitely order again.
B00ASHVVC6|5|Great fit!  Just as it appears except color is more green than blue.  Still love it! I would recommend buying this suit.
B00J8EGI46|5|Very nice, just too small
B00N4M4AUC|5|So soft!!  Very happy!  :))
B007X546EQ|5|The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. It was bought as a Christmas present, and the recipient loved it and can't wait to wear it out!
B00HER0N4U|5|LOVING THIS ITEM HOW DID I EVER SURVIVE WITHOUT AMAZON IS AMAZING
B00PSEAWFG|4|This was a very nice dress, lovely fabric and workmanship. The fit would be good for the ladies that are a C-D cup. Unfortunately, I do not fit into that category.
B0037X5W6E|5|Great product. Fits as expected. If you wear it against your body it does not ride up, however if you wear it over other undergarments it will ride up!
B007X7WJXO|4|Its slim and fits a bit small but overall excellent vest. Its made of great fabric and metalic buttons making it long lasting as well as very stylish.
B008H7J5JA|5|This is a cute and fitted sweater. I got this in Acai Berry and Kensington blue. They are my favorite sweaters to wear when it is cold outside.
B00HJOMEI6|4|I purchased for my husband.  he likes the material, says they are comfortable.  A little large, but would purchase again.
B008H48VO8|5|This is much more than just a cap. The flaps work fantastic, do exactly what I wanted them to do, keep my ears and back of head very warm.  Heavy weight and strong, a great cap to work in or just grab to run outside and run the trash up to the road. I heard many comments that this cap didn't fit right, well mine fit perfect and the flaps covered my ears just right.i purchased a L/XL, and I wear a 7 1/4 hat.  The fit is perfect. Highly recommend this product.
B00JWG097C|3|Good little item for it's price.. thanks
B002Y3SD28|5|Shipping was fast, 4 days early!<br /><br />No problem's with hat size as mentioned by previous comments... know your size!<br /><br />The hat does come &#34;stiff&#34; or &#34;rigid&#34; but after 10-15 mins of giving it the ole baseball gloove treatment the problem was solved. Just FYI they all come this way, it's NEW!<br /><br />Small complaint's<br /><br />emblem doesnt come attached, but a trip to thier website FAQ's and 2 mins of your time, you'll have the emblem set up and ready to show off.<br /><br />I would wash the hat before you wear as well, VERY slight chemical smell. But I also have a nose like a hound.
B00QI2E492|5|Cute
B00KJDP6RK|4|Happy with my purchase
B00GUBHBRS|5|I  bought  this  for  my  granddaughter  for  Christmas  and  she  loves  it .
B00CKLIGF8|4|I would love it if I had gotten a Large insted of XL. I love the Allegra K shirts because they run big and I like my shirts loose (and if I go Large instead and get one of those other &#34;not Allegra K's&#34; then they are way too small, even for my grandaughter) This one had a really large neck but I just wear a shirt underneath and it works fine. Soft fabric and washed great with washer and dryer (didn't shrink much at all). Would buy again. Maybe try to get one in blue.
B0081SKHDS|5|Great hat, wore it while traveling out of the country and was very satisfied.
B0093N1X0G|5|Fits exactly as you would expect a Jr size t-shirt to fit.
B006WLTCZU|5|Nice shirt. Fits just fine. Not tight, a little loose, but comfortable. I'm 5'10&#34;, 170 lbs and a medium fits great.
B00LCUUAN4|4|Came on time and great quality
B004MMFWI2|5|My grandson loved the cars on the training pants.  They are a perfect fit and helped make the transition to regular pants.
B00ITSY6UK|5|I love the costume!! Little small but I love it
B009QEEP8Y|5|A shade deeper red than my computer screen displays. Well made shirt 100% cotton made in Meh he co.
B001BPVC82|5|It's so cute on the baby! My daughter is 8 months old, we used it during this last summer/fall, i hope it still fits her next summer. The brim is wide enough to shield her eyes from the sun, but doesn't interfere too much that she's swatting it off.  So, I'd recommend!
B007R2MTOO|4|I'm 5'2&#34; and about 115lbs. The small fit me perfectly. This costume is of high quality and you can't beat the price. It comes with almost everything you need to complete the look. I'm very excited to wear this costume to my family Halloween party. Just one warning, it is a little bit itchy in the arm area.
B006THBD22|5|&#34;A Absolute Amazing Pair Of Stylish And High Quality Cuff Links!!!...
B001WCC8YG|5|looks great :)
B00C01MKKK|5|I plan on ordering a few more colors. Love the fit and looks lovely.  Stretches well and fit wells. Will get more
B004TTOQDK|5|I ordered this item for my second daughter on the way. I couldn't have asked for them to be shipped any faster. They arrived 3 days after I ordered them and the estimated delivery window was 5-7days! I opened the package and every thing was in great condition. The flowers weren't squashed, the headbands weren't snagged, etc. Just great condition. I loved the variety and I even got a bonus flower that's super cute. Couldn't beat the sale price on here given that ONE of these styled headbands can cost a lot at baby boutiques and/or high end department stores. Very happy with this purchase and now I just need to figure out how to store them so they stay in nice condition. :)
B00P9LR1OS|5|Excellent product which made a fine gift.
B00OLDZIS6|5|I really like this belt.  Was looking for something to wear for golf.  Needed gray (an unusual color) and something that would be very durable.  This was a good one.  I would buy other colors if I needed them.
B008A1JK8Y|2|I asked for grey and you send me green. Perhaps it is not clear in the photo or you send me the worn one.
B009O8GGP2|5|Beautiful fabric, excellent fit and quality. I love all the tops I purchased from PB.
B00C9LO03G|5|Exactly what I was looking for. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B0000WL386|5|The coat arrived on the day as promised.  The coat is as described, it fits great and is very warm.
B00N8B6S7C|5|Love them but this particular pair took a long time to ship it seems.
B0030VOYVM|5|So cute! Very happy.
B00274LPT2|5|Nice cool hat. Keeps sun off neck, face and head. Helps keep sweat out of eyes.
B00KROQZ76|3|They fit small - but cute and good quality.
B00I3P3RGS|4|Love it I got this for me and I love it its nice to be able to get nice nightgowns in a 5x :)
B00MEVEJ1O|2|I did not like, looked very cheap.
B0044VEFWK|4|I'm 5'10 and often bemoan my large pumpkin head when trying on &#34;one size fits all' hats. I was reluctant to order this hat until I read that another reviewer (more or less with the same predicament) had found it to be a very roomy lid. It is roomy - fits comfortably with a little room to spare even - and it is also very pretty prompting two strangers to ask me where I got it the first time I wore it on the street. Not the warmest hat but it does block the wind better than say, not wearing a hat at all.  It was probably wishful thinking on my part since the product pic is in profile but I also learned flower is positioned on the front not the side of the hat. Still cute, though:)
B00OPDBLGU|5|One is word needed to describe this shirt that word is awsome! I`m such a big fan of  that cool, cute, funny, beautiful, flying, super strong, and indestructible skunk haired Mississippi southern belle! The shirt feels great and the awsome image of lovely Rogue is well done. Just make sure you turn your Rogue shirt inside out so that the image of Rogue doesn`t get damaged when you wash it. This shirt is definitely  something all Rogue fans should have and wear!
B008JIX8K4|5|Love it! It came a little wrinkled, but that's an easy fix. The length is great and it looks very classic and pretty. The sparkly beads do look like they were glued on witha  glue gun, but what the heck? you only wear it once and no one would notice. Overall, good product
B001111Q00|5|Vest fits and is comfortable. Great for the southern weather.
B00P6967AC|5|Looks great. Fits well. Washes up nice.
B008DCPG1A|5|I'm looking forward to wearing them.  Haven't had a chance yet.  But will.  I like the neat cargo pockets with zipper, yet.
B007FCF1XM|2|Did not fit luckily I was able to return because the sizing is way off
B00CAMKJNO|4|This dress is beautiful and I get it perfect, but the size is super girl, you have to be aware with this ... Thank God I am very well! thanks
B007GBH7DO|5|I purchased train panamas for my grandson who absolutely loves choo choo trains. He was so happy! This was a most successful purchase!
B00ANLLJ6K|2|These were not a terry short as described. They met the need, but I was disappointed in the mix up. They will be ok, but I was looking for something different. On a playground with mulch, these snag really easily. After one wearing they looked months old.
B00MW5JS9U|5|Fit really good
B00KIGJ0SY|5|adorable outfit
B00JF5NOKE|3|The top is nice and offers a good lift. The high waisted bikini is better suited for ladies with a long torso. I have a short torso, and it's not a flattering proportion for my body type.
B001O9BEHY|5|Fit great, good quality.
B001EQJ4OW|5|I keep comming back to the bra, it is the best for me. I hope they never discontinue this style. They are very comfortable and fit well. Very hard to find my size in the store so happy I could find them here on Amazon!
B005JCDXQM|3|Sizing gives no description for rise no these are made to fit above the waist. This makes them ride down for me and is the only thing I disliked about them, Other than that like the weight, pockets and feel.<br /><br />Would have rated higher if the rise had be talked about.
B007K3DJ6C|3|It is exactly the look I wanted but it is a little to small for my head.I am tall with lots of hair though so it would probably fit other women. I still wear it when I know ill be in the sun for hours. I know if it fit better I would wear it way more. Its a good item just wish it was a little bigger.
B007W9ZV3S|5|I'm 5'1\\" & this is pretty short for me. But it's a very cute dress, I wear leggings or a skirt with it.  The lining barely covers my butt.  The flowers are actually brighter than they appear, they're vivid red but still cute.  the thin chiffon material is great for hot AZ weather.  All in all, can't complain for the price.
B00EP2CC0A|2|i order a small i got a medium. am disappointed. i need a refund. i cant wear it
B00J2S6ECE|3|34 is my usully Wright size... However it get larger with FC. Regards, Rodrigo
B00DDVV6HY|4|This is a well made garment.  The fabric is a nice weight, not flimsy.  It's a &#34;one-size fits all&#34; and I am size 4-6 and it clings very snuggily (if that's a word) to my body.  The only thing that I don't like is how it slowly starts to hike up throughout the day, so I need to keep pulling it down.
B00EYZD1TO|4|Good quality. Run a little big but very comfy
B00CE32AJ0|5|It's a regular tee but short i like long tees
B00NUJ7PHO|5|The wife loved them. Exactly what she wanted
B00DDX678U|3|The metallic detailing on this shirt is actually gold-colored, not pewter.  I still like the shirt and will wear it, but just keep in mind it's gold -- thus making it more difficult to match with other things.
B00S672S1S|4|I have a almost four year old son and this was way too small for him.
B008M11YZE|1|I ordered these hats in October,  and I received them in December.  The finally arrived too small.  Do not buy this product just go to the store and buy a cheaper,  better hat
B0007YRA4I|5|The cup size we kinda large but over all it was fine, I belive I need a 46-c.
B008MEV6AY|5|Our nephew loved his gift. He could barely contain himself. The quality was good and it is just perfect for the Star Wars geek.
B0131JRQSU|1|Not as pictured.  More of a shawl than cardigan or poncho.
B0089J8LP0|3|It's okay but I found the fit a little too tight especially on the bust/chest area. Should have maybe ordered the next size up but decided against it.
B003RD51LK|5|I love my new shaggy wig, and feel that it is a good alternative to real hair!  I really love the look, and also wish that men would return to this look now, in this era.  I, a female, have always been fascinated by men wearing longer hairstyles, and I do not even consider this to be &#34;long&#34; hair.  It is simply longer than what most wear, but has a classy edge to it.  It can easily be worn by either a male or a female.  I do not consider it a costume, but, rather, a hair addition tool.
B0099XWNM2|5|I love this skirt...and i enjoy it so much...i recommand it for all women..don't hesitat  to buy it...all rights.thank you.
B0018OQYE8|5|great texture, bought for dress jeans.  excellent price  thank-you
