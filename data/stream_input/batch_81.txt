B000002MP2|4.0|Dookie, Green Day's third album, is by far their most popular and is definitely one of their best.  With major chart-toppers like &quot;Basket Case&quot; and &quot;When I Come Around&quot; that still play on pop radio  stations today to thier signature punk songs like &quot;Burnout,&quot;  &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; and  &quot;Chump,&quot; Dookie whips past  you with three cords so fast that you'll have to listen to it repeatedly to  get the most out of it.
0375411550|4.0|I bought and read The Bluest Eyes yesterday at the bookstore and today it was announced as Oprah's new pick. I have read and enjoyed Toni Morrison before, so I was anxious to read this short story.  I was not disappointed  and did not go to sleep until the book was finished.     What struck me in  the story is that beyond the prejudice of color the characters lives are  all touched by some element of &quot;being looked down upon.&quot;  All the  characters face the pain of not being respected and treated decently by  others. Pecola unfortunately happens to be the one that is at the bottom of  the heap, so to speak.   This story touched me because so often people look  for the &quot;ugly&quot; in others to make themselves feel better and   don't stop to think how deeply hurtful that is to others. Haven't we all  wished for something to make us more beautiful, more loved like Pecola who  dreams that merely changing the color of her eyes would change the  direction of her life.

B00003XB8K|3.0|When I bought Enigma's fourth cd I had hoped that Michael Cretu was going to take his music in another direction. Upon first listen I thought the cd was okay, nothing different from the previous three cds. Upon repeated  listenings I began to enjoy this cd more, but I still feel that it's the  same cycle Michael used on the other three Enigma releases. I have been a  long time fan of Enigma, but beginning with 1996's &quot;Le Roi Est Mort,  Vive Le Roi!&quot; I began to feel that Cretu was running out of new ideas.  &quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; hasn't really improved my  attitude. Some of the songs sound like 1993's &quot;Return To  Innocence&quot; and 1990's &quot;Sadness Pt. 1&quot;. Cretu is becoming  musically challenged since the genre he's working within has limitations.  Perhaps he should take a cue from fellow genre-members Deep Forest and  blend other elements into his mix. Ironically, I'd recommend &quot;The  Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; to non-Enigma listeners who do not own an  Enigma cd. I'm sure hardcore Enigma fans will check this cd out anyway, but  I'd offer caution in purchasing it because Cretu hasn't changed much.

0802713319|5.0|Singh provided a touching degree of warmth to the otherwise perceived cool if not cold affectations often associated with mathmaticians and their mystique or oftimes obsessions with numbers in his enticing work  &quot;Fermat's Enigma,&quot; a story woven and embellished by his  thoroughly researched  history of numbers as seen through the eyes of  ambitious mathematician's and viewed in context of the true story of  contemporary mathematician Andrew Wiles whose passion propelled him to  solve a cryptic theorem made by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and which posed a  tempting and baffling riddle for some 350 years.<br />Knowledge of numbers or  higher mathematics is not essential to the reader as Singh introduces these  judiciously, just adequately to whet our appetites and tease us about the  novelty and also delightful simplicity of numbers -  so we can better try  to appreciate the challenge to Wile, his preparation (ostensibly from  childhood) and eventual generally conceded victory re: A^n + B^n = C^n  where (n &gt;2), the Pythagorean to a power cubed or greater.<br />Chapters  &quot;A Mathematical Disgrace&quot; and &quot;A Slight Problem&quot; are  especially well-written. The author appears to have been a bit heavy in the  re-stating of Andrew's quest but this is his main focus. Singh's intriguing  review of historical data and selection of subject matter covering numbers  may have also set the stage for a notable documentary, &quot;The Code  Book,&quot; which discusses the Scherbius's Enigma machine and a few  notables also appearing in Fermat's Enigma. We are wont to wonder if Fermat  had, afterall, a solution himself.  Once begun, the book is hard to put  down until read.
B00000K2SC|3.0|I saw this movie right when it came out, in a theater with a huge screen and dolby sound and all that, and I LOVED it.  It was dark, edgy, pushed a lot of boundaries and I was thinking about it for days afterwards.  Well, I  rented it again last week (and was thinking of buying it) but I found that  at the second viewing, the movie had really lost its edge for me.  When you  already know the intricasies of the plot and have already figured out where  the labyrinth goes, most of what is left is a bunch of special effects and  fight scenes.  Admittedly the special effects and fight scenes are  excellent examples of editing and high tech computer graphics, but the  movie did not draw me in on the second viewing and I'm glad I didn't buy a  copy of it.

B000002UZ4|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys had an enormous string of hits during the 80s and early 90s, especially in the UK. This album collects them all. While most compilations leave out essential hits to make you buy the original albums  (Dire Straits, Prince, U2 and Simple Minds come to mind) this album has  them all (OK, &quot;How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously&quot; is  missing). From the first single &quot;West end Girls&quot; on all the hits  are here. High points include &quot;Suburbia&quot; , &quot;Heart&quot;,  &quot;Always on my Mind&quot; and &quot;Left to my own Devices&quot;. 80s  music was partly shaped by these guys. For longer versions/remixes check  out &quot;Disco&quot;, which includes very long remixes of &quot;West end  Girls&quot;, &quot;Suburbia&quot;, &quot;Opportunities&quot;, &quot;Love  Comes Quickly&quot; and the in 1995 remixed b-side &quot;Paninaro&quot;.  &quot;Introspective&quot; includes a strong techno-oriented remix of  &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; and long versions of &quot;It's  Alright&quot;, &quot;Domino Dancing&quot; and &quot;Left to my own  devices&quot;<br />Essential
6305358613|5.0|Cannot yet understand how come Ms Blanchet did not get the award for best actress instead of Paltrow! Such a same!  It has been well known about the film Elizabeth is not &quot;historically accurated&quot;, actually I don't  care! I would read a history book if I needed an &quot;acurate view&quot;  (it it exists). But what it is accurate is Cate Blanchett rules in this  film and over many others, WHAT A PERFORMANCE!
0783225881|5.0|I watched this movie while doing a medical study. I was in a room with a about ten guys. It made me laugh to see them all try to hold back there tears at the end. Some buried there face in the table, some made big gulps,  a few just got up and left, and one just sat there wiping his eyes. <br />Now  if you'll excuse me, I have to go tell my Dad I love him.
B0000027RL|5.0|Now, i just want to start off by saying that this isnt Pearl Jam's best album (Vitalogy is), but this one carries the most emotion. The pain and emotion expressed in Eddie Vedder's lyrics are unmatchable, and the music is no exception. This is really the only Pearl Jam album where you can  actually hear the hurt in Eddie's voice...his voice has always sounded  different on the other records. I suppose the reason for that is because  Pearl Jam made this record when Eddie was still living out of his own  pocket, and i guess that he was really angry. Although Pearl Jam made  some better records later in their career(Vitalogy and No Code), they never  really matched the pain and emotion that is expressed in this recording.  &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Why Go&quot;, and  &quot;Black&quot; are some of the most emotional songs ever when it comes  to expressing anger, and above all - pain. So buy this one and listen to  the lyrics and Eddie's voice...it will send you soul searching, and might  even make you cry. After you appreciate the music on this album, buy their  other albums...they are all masterpieces <br />Im going to put Pearl Jam's albums in order of how good they  are:<br />1)Vitalogy- My favorite Pearl Jam album. There isnt one bad song on  this one (except for maybe those crazy experiments they did)  &quot;Nothingman&quot;, Better Man&quot;, and &quot;Satan's Bed&quot; are  the greatest tracks on this record.<br />2)No Code- This is the most diverse  Pearl Jam album, it stands alone from the others. No Code doesnt really  have a musical style that can be classified, and it is almost as good as  Vitalogy...It also contains my two favorite Pearl Jam songs: &quot;Hail  Hail&quot; and &quot;Off He Goes&quot;.<br />3)Ten- The bands rawest album,  you can feel the anger and pain...<br />4)Yield- This is a great album no  matter what anyone says. It has some great tracks, including some of Pearl  Jam's best songs such as: &quot;No Way&quot;, &quot;Faithfull&quot;, and of  course &quot;Given to Fly&quot;. Great album.<br />5)Vs.- This is my least  favorite Pearl Jam album because of the limited amount of good tracks. But  this isnt one of those sophomore album &quot;slumps&quot;. This is a really  good record, but its just my least favorite from the PJ catalogue. It  contains some of Pearl Jam's greatest songs though: &quot;Go&quot;,  &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Dissident&quot;, and the  great &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Ok, so &quot;Alien 3&quot; was not as classic as &quot;Alien&quot; or as fun as &quot;Aliens&quot;, but it was not as horrible as many people have claimed.  It was a terrific conclusion to the Alien series. (I don't  include Alien: Resurection to be part of the series because it was so  pointless and stupid.) The plot moved along smoothy and the acting was  great, especially Weaver who I feel did the most convincing job in the  series.  On a side note I thought it was a superb idea to give the alien  dog-like physical characteristics since its host was a Rotweiler.  The only  things I didnt care for in this final chapter was how the scrip-writer cut  out Newt and Hick's role.  Im sure the two would have been more than glad  to return to make Alien 3 if they were given the opportunity.  Anyway, it  was a wonderfully crafted movie just not fully up to par as the first two.   <br />P.S.- there is not a more satisfying, clever ending to a movie than this  one.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver<br />This is another excellent selection by Lowry. Herdetailed description and vivid writing guide the story along verywell. The Giver is a quick book because once you start it, you can'tput it down. Personally, this book was well worth my time and I reccomend that all of you consider reading it.<br />It's about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community in the far away furture. The world he lives in is perfect. No one has a choice about anything from whom their spouce should be to what job they should choose. They don't even make their own children! A person is selected to do this job. Every one is the same and every one develops the same. Children even have their birthdays on the same day. The rules are very complicated because they don't want the world to go back to the same state as it was long before their time. <br />When Jonas turns twelve, he gets the highly honored job of keeping all of the memories, the painful and wonderful feelings of the past. He recieves the memories from the Giver who recieved the same memories from another giver generations ago. They are passed down in a continuous cycle from one Giver to the next. It is important that only the Giver recieves the memories so that the community isn't overwhelmed by all of the feelings which they never knew existed. If the memories were to excape the Givers, whether it be through death or release, the community would go back to its wretched ways of long ago.  Some of the memories are painful but some are also joyful memories of things such as colors, birthday parties and love. This is a great book that I think deserved the John Newbury Medal, which it was awarded.<br />The people in this world do not see the colors, they don't have love, and they don't know of war and death.  If there were such a world, I would fear that it would be too fragile if anything abnormal occurred. I would much rather have a more prepared and experienced community like we have today than to sacrifice the pleasures of life for a delicate world of sameness. When reading this inspiring story, it makes you think, &quot;What has the world come to?&quot; Although, I do believe that it is a rather critical point of view for such a real-life topic, it still makes you think. It is almost immpossible to imagine a world without violence or crime. An infalible world of sameness.
B000003TA2|5.0|I know a lot of &quot;old school&quot; SY fans will disagree with me, but I truly think the early 90's were the pinnacle of Sonic Youth's creative genius, and I submit this CD as proof. There is something to like about all  of their records, but Goo is the perfect amalgamation of sweet, subtle  melodies, uncomfortable dissonance, driving beats and shimmering waves of  distortion. &quot;Dirty Boots&quot; opens quietly, then crescendos into a  charged rocker. Lee Renaldo's &quot;Mote&quot; is the aural equivalent of a  windtunnel, and will part your hair - why doesn't he write more songs? The  tense &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; teases you into thinking it's an  instrumental, then bursts into beautifully unadulterated chaos. More  song-oriented and less jam-oriented than others, this album along with  Dirty make up part of my &quot;desert island&quot; collection. Highly  recommended.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Each song on this CD takes you on a different journey in time and place.  Some songs you just want to sit quietly and listen to every tune and others simply will not allow you to sit still.  This is a great CD to do your  workout with.  The time flies and it is never boring.  I look forward to  what Santana comes out with next!
0792101448|5.0|A great western with a beautiful music score. Henry Fonda plays a really mean villian which matches well against Bronson's cool calculating character; and how about that scene right after the opening credits.
B000005H4F|5.0|The first time I heard this cd, what may have struck me most was how &quot;close&quot; the music sounds. I listened to this cd in headphones the first time and I think the only way I could have felt closer to Cannonball,  or the only way his tone could have been richer is if I had been there in  the studio standing five feet away from him when this music was being  recorded.<br />Now aside from that, the playing is wonderful. I just got this  recently and it has become my favorite Cannonball album. Being the standard  that it is, AUTUMN LEAVES has been played thousands of times by most every  jazz musician at one time or another but the version on this cd is just so  special. Even if I disliked every other track I'd still feel as if my  purchase of this cd was worth it just because of the beauty of this AUTUMN  LEAVES. I's been said that this is a Miles Davis album with Cannonballs  name on it. I don't believe that for one minute. This is a great band but I  think overall, it will be the beauty and soul in every note that Cannonball  plays that will leave the biggest impression on you. No, Cannonball wasn't  the most innovative and groundbreaking alto player in history but he was  certainly one of the best. He played from the heart and his tone is just  indescribably perfect, and it is captured in all it's glory on this cd.
B00004SVID|5.0|Well, it is 15 years since Roger Waters jumped ship and sued remaining band members in order to completely destroy Pink Floyd. David Gilmour, whose New year's resolution was to &quot;give up eating,&quot; is sporting  a bot belly that puts those little Buddha statues to shame, while his  efforts to keep the band afloat in Waters's absence yielded two studio  albums worthy of Holiday inn elevators around the world. The only solace  for most Pink floyd fans today is to pack the CD magazines of their cars  full of albums like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Animals,&quot;  Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;The Wall,&quot; which is why &quot;Is  There Anybody out There&quot; serves as a particularly tasty treat. Most  fans usually cringe at the thought of a live album, because the sound is  usually less than desirable. Not so here, this album offers masterful  sound, stunning clarity and power. To think that this was recorded in 1980  is truly amazing, given its quality. The album offers some previously  unreleased tracks, like the short but sizzling 'What Shall We Do now,&quot;  and notes written by the band members themselves are insightful and  interesting. But the album's real advantage is its ferocity, serving as a  tribute to the power these four men once possessed. These days, Gilmour is  more satisfied with cream puffs in his face than a guitar in his hands, and  Roger still insists on recording dour, unsuccessful solo albums, but  &quot;Is There Anybody out There&quot; recalls a time when a band called  Pink Floyd was king.
B00000DGUG|4.0|Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie definitely tells us that a lot has happened to Alanis in three years, personally and musically. She has droped her angry feminist vibe and has focused on her inner self. &quot;Thank  You&quot; is a humble tribute to India, &quot;Baba&quot; deals with  religion, &quot;Heart of The House&quot; is dedicated to her mother, and  &quot;Unsent&quot; has very personal messages to her ex-boyfriends. She  definitely is into dance and techno influence, as we can hear on &quot;So  Pure,&quot; and &quot;Front Row.&quot; This CD is not as elecrtifying as  Jagged Little Pill, but definitely more mellow. It's good to listen to if  you want to unwind.

6300215512|5.0|One of the great film lines (and this film has a lot of them) is delivered with stunning bravado by Gloria Swanson in the preeminant movie about Hollywood.  The marvelous Miss Swanson is equally supported by William  Holden's gigolo and Erich von Stroheim brilliant performance as servant  Max.<br />Billy Wilder, one of the best to ever sit in the director's chair,  has crafted a flawless film.  The black and white cinematography reminds us  that many of the greats to ever grace the silver screen are behind us.  Like Davis, Crawford, Gable, Leigh, Wayne, there will never be another  Swanson or Holden.<br />For all those who may be thinking of remaking this  one, I hope that they reconsider.<br />There is only one &quot;Mona  Lisa!&quot;
6305428220|4.0|I would have to describe this is as Dawsons Creek meets the X-files! A kind of sci-fi thriller for teens , older viewers may not appreciate the whole high school scene. This is not as good as 'From Dusk til Dawn' for  those who saw that Robert Rodriguez directed this and thought it might be  the same. It's not like the whole 'bodysnatchers' theme hasn't been done  before but still this is quite watchable. Also Salma Hayek fans beware  she's hardly in this movie! Any 'Scream' or 'I know what you did last  summer' fans might like this.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is a response to the guy who was refering to this album as techno.  This is a pop album with electronica in it.  The lyrics are deep and she sounds better than ever.  It's a new sound, since dance music usually lacks  emotion.
B000021XS0|5.0|I had never even heard of Dream Theater before I bought this album. I just found it here on Amazon, listened to the clips, and bought the CD. There is a large amount of astoundingly impressive musicianship throughout this  album. The guitarist is awesome, the keyboardist has some neat solos and  very creative melodies, the drummer is extremely talented (although I still  like Neil Peart of Rush better), and their bassist is very good (even  though I don't here the lines too well. He blends well, obviously). I don't  like the vocalist terribly well, but I can live with it. The concept and  story are beautifully written and somehow remain poetic while still  maintaining a plot and being intellectual without reduction to spoken word  or simplification for song-arranging purpose. If you are going to listen to  this album, make sure you can go 77 minutes without doing much else. It  just doesn't feel right to stop this masterpiece while it's in motion. If  you enjoy prog-metal, you'll be very pleased with this album.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Its not easy being a whistle blower, especially when you are blowing the whistle on the tobacco company who by the way looked so slimmy and evil in this movie ..well crow's character, wigand did just that...suffered and  lost everything in the process..or did he? Thinking that this is news  worthy info that America should know..he gets indirectly involved with  unsavory corporate news broadcasters...talk about bad karma  It is a great  movie, makes one think if those smoking prevention commercials for teens  are a direct result of wigand's disclosure about tobacco companies and what  news networks omit by choice..go see this movie and figure it out!
630575067X|2.0|I really cannot appreciate this movie in more areas than visual special effects. The plot was weak, the acting wasn't exactly top notch, and it just felt so... cliche. Granted, I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, but I  know people who stayed in line eight hours to catch the first night who  felt disappointed. Aside from some really awesome graphics, I can't give  any credit to this over-hyped fluke.

B000023VR6|3.0|Dont get me wrong, Dr. Dre is probably the greatest rapper out there, and this album is good.  But its not great.  &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot; with Eminem is wonderful and catchy but the rest of the album is decent and dull  at times.
B00000K2SE|2.0|It must be the &quot;age-thing&quot; because I just didn't find this film to be all that others said it was cracked up to be.  The special effects were great but the story was somewhat confusing and muddled.  The  performances from the principles was adequate, although I had difficulty at  times understanding both Fishburne and Reeves because of their  &quot;muffled&quot; deliveries. Both - yes, BOTH - have done better work in  the past.  I suppose a big pay check was the reason for their decision to  get involved in such fluff!<br />This is one of the films that will not  &quot;age&quot; well.  Its use of contemporary terminology and fears about  present and future technology will be meaningless in a few years.  Thus,  the film, no matter its current popularity, will not make anyone's great  films' list.<br />For all its Academy Award-winning SFX the flick was no more  satisfying than a video game.  A less successful film of the early 80's  came to mind after I saw &quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br />Can anyone say  &quot;Tron?&quot;
0671646788|5.0|Very inspiring and emotionally uplifting.  Easy and fast reading.  It is full of clear positive concepts that persist after reading. I would call this a must-read for anyone seeking insight into developing a more positive attitude.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I must admit that 'My Own Prison' slipped under my radar.  The songs on it were good, but it sounded to me like Pearl Jam or Seven Mary Three and I must have tuned it out.  Then when someone lent me 'Human Clay' I was blown  away.<br />This is a great CD.  The pacing is superb, they get angry and they  get sensitive all at the right times to keep the flow of the Disc going.   There are no 'skip' songs on this disc, they are all really good.<br />If you  are interested I did pick up 'My Own Prison' since I got 'Human Clay' and  like it, but it is not as good as 'Clay'.
076780421X|4.0|Having described the film as all of the above , I still love this movie , even though I'm told its a 'chic flick' ! Salma Hayek and Matt Perry make a great duo , with Perry doing a 'Chandler' and Hayek being that loveable  latin girl. This is your average romantic comedy , but hey , it reduced a  guy like me to tears , well a little bit anyway !
B00003OSSL|1.0|I like Harrison Ford, I like Kristin Scott Thomas, and I even like Charles Dutton (except for Alien 3, yakk).  But this movie is a clunker.  If it were a horse I would have shot it to put it out of my misery.<br />There is no  real suspense and there is no one to root for.  Ford's character is driven  to find the truth, and the truth is simply the obvious.  There is no twist,  his wife was sleeping with Thomas' husband.  We know it, their friends know  it, their co-workers know it, but we have to follow this loser as he spends  2 hours of my life (that I will never get back, I might add) on figuring  that out himself.  Rent this film at most, do not buy.
6305313687|5.0|This is by far the best movie that i own on dvd and i own a heck of a lot. Edward Norton was so amazing and i can not beleave that he did not win the acadamy award.  This movie is not for people faint of heart it contains  quite a bit of racisal slurs also there is a rape scene and some other  nudity, and finally it is very i repeat very violent but all tastfully  done.  There is one scene in this movie that i did not like as much as the  rest of the scenes in the movie, the scene was when Edward Norton curbs a  black man.  It is very disturbing but i do beleave it is very important to  the film. Enjoy I guarantee that you will!

You can't be a Beatles fan without &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;All You Need Is  Love&quot;! Sure, The White Album and Abbey Road outdo it, but lets say  this, this disc is better than its movie!
B000002BUY|5.0|I am very surprised that Incubus aren't the biggest band in the world right now, because S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is the greatest album in the world. Incubus blends funk guitars, high energy drumming and scratching, and one  of the best vocals I've ever heard. Almost all of the tracks deserve five  stars, all except for Nebula, because of the sample at the beginning  (&quot;smells like cheese&quot;) but the rest of the song is okay. Standout  tracks include New Skin (the definite best song ever written), Vitamin,  Redefine, Calgone, Favorite Things, and A Certain Shade of Green. I am not  going to recommend any other bands because no one is quite like Incubus.  This is extreme music for an extreme age.
6303257844|5.0|At the amusement park, do you like the roller coaster or the merry-go-round? If your answer is roller coaster, keep reading.  Oh, one more thing. Do you have a heart condition? No? Oh, good! Well, you have  passed the test-- you should definitely love Speed.  So hurry up and go buy  it!<br />This movie is very ENTERTAINING and STIMULATING.  You will lean  forward in your seat and you may notice your hands clench and your muscles  tense up with anticipation. Not many movies are so exciting that they  achieve a physical response from the audience like this!  Another reason  you might feel this way could be due to the incredibly sexy actors, Keanu  Reeves and Sandra Bullock.  Together they have great chemistry on the  screen and make a super duo.  A note to Keanu fans, he is at his sexiest in  this movie and that smile will knock you out flat! (Also Dennis Hopper gets  my vote as a great reprobative villain. Furthermore, Jeff Daniels plays  Keanu's mentor wonderfully, they are very believable as best  friends.)<br />Speed makes a great date movie, party movie, or just anytime  you need a wakeup call. Speed says to me, 'Live life to the fullest and  find your passion!'<br />YOU WON'T FIND MORE ACTION THAN THIS ANYWHERE!  THIS  IS THE KING OF ACTION MOVIES! (However, Point Break is a great action movie  to see also if you haven't already.)

0679720200|5.0|This book emphasizes how life is pointless and how humans have form their own meanings for their existence.  The problem is other people and the lack of understanding between individuals.  Camus shows how telling the truth is the most noble thing to do eventhough others will not accept the truth.  A  level below Dostoevsky and a level above Sartre, as far as Existential  literature is concerned.
0767836286|5.0|Even if ARLINGTON ROAD is not a masterpiece, it's still one of the best movie I've seen this year and I hope that its DVD release will be a huge success. While THE NEGOTIATOR was the surprise hit of 1998, ARLINGTON ROAD,  at least I hope so, is going to be the sleeper of 1999-2000.<br />The first 10  minutes of the movie reveal a great filmmaker who knows how to create  uneasiness in the audience. Uneasiness is the adequate word to qualify the  state of mind of the viewer during the whole movie. ARLINGTON ROAD could  have been another film exploring the activities of the extremist groups  that have recently appeared in the U.S.A. but, fortunately, the movie is  more an above-average thriller than a political and social study.<br />Secret  conspiracies are one of the themes Hollywood has treated by the dozen since  50 years ; communists, KKK, CIA, FBI, The Organisation, intellectuals and  martians's plots have been discovered and heavily punished by our favorite  heroes. It seems that there will always be a worm to be crushed in the  american apple.<br />Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges give performances that will  linger a long time in my memory, along with the strange character played by  Joan Cusack. All in all, ARLINGTON ROAD deserves to be considered as one of  the rare good american movies of 1999.<br />A DVD for your library.
B0000203YT|5.0|It seems to be almost blasphemy to make fictionalized accounts of the greatest writer in the history of the world, but this film is an exciting view into the life of what may have possibly been William Shakespeare's  life.  Lady Viola is based on a true life mistress that Shakespeare had.   Many of the characters are historically accurate.  But the story is  wonderfully beautiful and a breath of fresh air from some of the movies  made today.  It is fitting and right that this movie won as many academy  awards as it did.
B000002G7G|5.0|WL/WH demands you pay attention, VU suggests you might like to listen. And then it grabs you...<br />It's all very quiet, genteel almost. After half an hour of beautifully crafted ballads and feel-good rockers you hear the  inane pop of &quot;Story of my Life&quot;. And that's where you got  suckered: the next eleven minutes are anything but comfortable.<br />&quot;The  Murder Mystery&quot; is a perfect expansion of ground explored on White  Light/White Heat. Words reminiscent of &quot;Black Angel's Death Song&quot;  on the first album spit at you and cajole you from opposing speakers - no  choice to listen to either words or music here as on &quot;The Gift&quot;.  Then as the madness fades, &quot;Afterhours&quot;... Mo's then fragile  voice singing of depression and paranoia.<br />I wish I could forget all  knowledge of this record so I could hear it again for the first time.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Oxygene has and continues to make a large impact on my musical appreciation, even the way I feel, ever since I first heard it back in '76 (when I was only 9). The musical complexity and yet organic and emotional  effect it has is quite staggering. You can almost see the waves crashing  over the shore; the impression of nature and hi-tech bound together. The  &quot;song of the air&quot;. Each time I hear it I find a new sound I had  missed previously, such is the detail of the composition. Amazing when you  consider it was recorded on only eight-track equipment in Jarre's dining  room. Definitely best heard through really good headphones, so you get  fully emmersed! Take a really deep breath and enjoy...
B000002G7E|5.0|It's 1971, I'm 14 years old and someone says &quot;listen to this - you'll hate it&quot;. I listened... title track not too bad. A story on a rock record?  Lady Godiva doesn't make sense. Here comes a pretty song. I turn  the record over. Is there something wrong with side 2? A mistake at the  pressing plant?<br />I listened again. And again. Amidst all the noise there  was the sound of a penny dropping. The first album was managed: &quot;you  gotta do this, you gotta do that&quot;, WL/WH is VU and just VU. An  unequivocal statement: &quot;We made this. We like it.&quot; A time  capsule.<br />Don't expect to like this record. Don't expect to feel  comfortable with it. The fewer expectations you have, the more you'll get  out of it. It's bleak, lyrical, nasty, inspiring, nihilistic and uplifting.  <br />I just wish that CDs had been around in 1968: there'd have been another  thirty minutes of it!
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this film with no pretenses - I had heard nothing beforehand.  What I got was the most entertaining movie I have ever seen.  I was so emotionally inspired I couldn't cry until it had ended - and then I  couldn't believe what I had seen.  Watch this film - you will get an  education you never imagined and entertainment you never expected.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This album is AWESOME!  The songs are great and some have a real strong meaning (like THE KIDS AREN'T ALRIGHT and THE END OF THE LINE).  Though the most popular, this CD doesn't best describe Offspring's singing.  Still,  that doesn't stop Offspring fom making a great album.  Plus, the enhanced  CD lets you see music videos of previous Offspring CDs.  Americana is a CD  that you can listen to to calm you down or just make listen to hear good  rock.  I really reccomend this CD to you!
B000002LCI|5.0|DM has anchored my cd collection for 16 years and is this 30 year old's favorite band.  Music for the Masses, to me, is their quintessential album and an excellent introduction for newbies. For those of us who appreciate  their middle years when they had perfected their trademark sound, this fine  offering has it all. Operatic, sweeping, and epic, their unique dark beat  pulses throughout. The hypnotic effect worked by Never Let Me Down Again is  complemented by the austerely mysterious longing of Little 15 and the  pleading of I Want you Now. There are, surprisingly to some, 'light'  moments on the album w/ Pleasure Little Treasure causing brief uplifting  only to be plunged downward once more by the heavy, introspective To Have  and To Hold. Pimpf introduces one to beautiful piano and then the sonic  subtleties of a desperate work camp, complete with swaying chants. But, my  favorite of the album and also of the band themselves, is Strangelove.  Combining the boys' patent kinky take on love and lust, it throbs forth  infectiously, daring one to ... \\"give in to sin, because I like to practice  what I preach.\\" The DM mystique bloomed fully after the release of this  album and their subsequent tour. Their follow up live album 101 contains  the concert versions of the majority of these songs.  Similar offerings can  be heard in later songs like Halo and It's No Good. As the guys continue to  press on it's enjoyable to go back and listen to some milestones. Highly  recommended.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is my favorite in my collection by a landslide. Songs like &quot;Around the World&quot; revive some of the familiar vibes, while ballads like &quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; &quot;Otherside,&quot; and &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; have something extra special injected in them that makes you  want to listen to them over and over... and over.. and over. ^_^ A  suprising addition is &quot;Porcelain,&quot; which seems as if the guys are  singing you a lullaby (a[...] It's a beautiful little diddy.  &quot;Savior&quot;'s an incredible song, with tight drums, strong bass,  great vocals, and fantastic guitar.<br />Anthony Kiedis's unique vocals are  even better than before and create the driving, flowing, upbeat frontal  sound. John Frusciante's guitar sings in every essence of the word.  Flea  lends more valuble energy to the music, he handles the bass skillfully, and  everytime I hear it's rhythms and melodies it makes me happy happy-- to the  point where I want to play bass like Flea (even though I can't play the  bass guitar... yet... but that isn't the point). The great thing about the  Chili Peppers is their bass isn't hidden behind scores of other  instruments-- it's right up front and it deserves it too.  Chad Smith's  percussion drives the songs. This may sound strange, but personally, I live  to hear the duh-duh duh-duh duh rhythm at the beginning of  &quot;Savior.&quot; It just whips the llama() ... I'm telling you. Teehee.  <br />My recommendation is: purchase this CD. Even if you have to jack it off  your friends. (One of them HAS to have it, right?) There will most likely  be at least ONE song you'll absolutely love if you aren't a RHCP fan. And  if you are a fan, eat the album up. Eat it ALLL up.
0783226837|5.0|I LIKE IT FOR REBA MCINTIRE. SHE IS MY BEST SINGER.
B000001Y42|5.0|This CD could just knock the wind right out of ya! Every song is totalluy hard rock, and as some would say, &quot;better than Signficant Other.&quot; If you don't mind hearing loud guitars, screaming, and negative lyrics that  have lots of meaning behind them, then you better go and pick up this CD!  The best songs are &quot;Counterfeit&quot; and &quot;Stuck&quot;, and  &quot;Faith&quot; comes pretty close too. &quot;Sour&quot; and  &quot;Everything&quot; don't have that hard rock vibe like the other songs  have, but it's still good to listen to every once in awhile.
B000005H4X|5.0|You know how when you buy speakers, the number one rule is \\"how does it sound?\\"<br />I don't know anything about Jazz, really. I surf the Amazon recommendations &amp; reviews, get friends' top tens. And then the bottom  line is simply \\"how does it sound?\\"<br />This record is certainly one the  absolute best. I just smile and groove on it from start to finish. <br />Great  tunes. Pure pleasure. Hope to find more like this.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is the perfect CD to take to the beach, or listen to at a party. All of the songs have a really cool vibe, and almost anyone could like it. (My mother likes it, and so does my 7 year old sister). Although there is  definitely a change in them since &quot;Dude Ranch,&quot; I still love this  CD. My favorites are &quot;Going Away to College,&quot; &quot;Adam's  Song,&quot; and &quot;Don't Leave Me.&quot; If you liked their hits  &quot;All the Small Things&quot; and &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot; then  you'll probably love the rest of the songs. The only songs I didn't like  were &quot;The Party Song&quot; and &quot;Dumpweed&quot;, but hey that's  just me :) I'd recommend Lit &quot;A Place In The Sun&quot;
B000002U8G|5.0|&quot;Echoes&quot; is one of the most amazing songs you'll ever hear.  After listening to all 23 minutes of it, you'll be amazed that it was actually that long.  It's transitions are smooth, the lyrics are ominous,  and Gilmour's guitar effects are amazing.  The rest of the album is great,  with it's aim at achieving a subtle mood throughout.  I especially like  &quot;One of these days&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot;.  When I think of  Meddle, I think of a far away land full of caves, mountains, and oceans.  A  great pre-dark side album, and album to lounge around to.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD has shown Limp Bizkit has definitely matured since their debut which was released in July of 1997. There is less screaming, and more melody, as well as better songwriting. The most well-known songs are  &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;Break Stuff&quot; which are two of my  favorites. &quot;Nobody Like You&quot; and &quot;Trust?&quot; are good  also. There are almost no BAD songs. If you don't like rap, you porbably  won't like &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; which features Method Man. And you  may not like &quot;A Lesson Learned&quot; which is basically a song with no  melody. These 5 guys are extremely talented, and this CD shows it. Pick up  your copy today! If you like their CD, I recommend Kid Rock &quot;Devil  Without A Cause&quot;, KoRn's &quot;Issues&quot; and the latest from P.O.D.
B000002C1Z|5.0|Easily one of the most underrated albums of all time.  I didn't know what to expect when I bought this album.  I hadn't heard any of the songs before, and I wasn't sure how all these Animals would come into context.   After listening to the album once, I was hooked.  Gilmour's guitar solo's  on this album rival his best work.  Roger even surpassed his best lyrical  work to date, but would outdo himself on the next album, The Wall.  Roger  classifies society into &quot;Dogs&quot;, &quot;Pigs&quot;, and  &quot;Sheep&quot;.  You'll have to listen to the album to find out what  each means.  &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; opens and closes this album, and  is one of Pink Floyd's few love songs.  Overall, a work of genius that  isn't recognized enough.
B000002WYT|5.0|Dave Matthews is the ultimate!  This band could rule the world, if they wanted too.  Without a doubt.  Besides, the much played, &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; there are amazing and brillant songs on this CD. From start to  finish, Dave, his songs and a very talented band, make &quot;The Dave  Matthews Band&quot; one of the greatest musical outlet's around.   You'll  never be sorry with a Dave Cd.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I consider the work of Roger Waters to be quite personal.  I only listen to Waters when I'm alone.  Most everyone I know just doesn't get his music.  It actually requires you to listen to it get a feel of what he's going  after, not just singing an overplayed chorus of the pop song of the day.   Pro's and Con's, Roger's first solo album after leaving Pink Floyd, is  filled with emotion.  Whether it's a flailing guitar passage by Eric  Clapton, or a haunting vocal sung by Roger, this album never seems to grow  old.  The plot remains interesting throughout as you follow Roger through a  series of alternating dreams and reality.  &quot;Sexual Revolution&quot;  and &quot;Every Stranger's Eyes&quot; stand out as my favorite tracks.   This is a true concept album.  &quot;I recognize myself, in every strangers  eyes.&quot;
6303921248|5.0|The BBC adaptation of Jane Austin's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is powerful, full of talent, with fascinating costumes/sets/and English countryside.  This is a fabulous movie with rising star Jennifer Ehle and  British star Colin Firth.  His Mr. Darcy and her Elizabet Bennett are  breathtaking.  Their chemistry is WONDERFUL and with the wonderful words of  Ms. Austin make for a wonderful film.  Colin Firth is wonderful and totally  worth the price of this movie alone.  GREAT MOVIE!
B000002C1X|5.0|Plain and simple, The Wall is not for everyone.  Roger Waters had two ideas for the next Pink Floyd album after Animals.  One of them was about a series of dreams Roger experienced (which would later become the first of  his solo albums, The Pro's and Con's of hitchiking), and the other was  about a rock star building a wall of isolation from the outside world.   Needless to say, The Wall was chosen and became one of Pink Floyd's best  known works.  From the opening track (In the Flesh) to the end (Outside the  Wall), this album never ceases to amaze me.  There is so much emotion  within these songs, it's hard to convey with writing.  &quot;The Thin  Ice&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, and &quot;Nobody Home&quot; are perfect  examples of this.  &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; remains one of the greatest  Pink Floyd songs, with one of the most emotional guitar solo's from David.   &quot;ABITW part 2&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, and &quot;Run Like  Hell&quot; are also great songs.  However, as I mentioned earlier, this  album will not appeal to everyone.  The album is intended to be listened to  all the way through so if you're a person who can't sit still for any  length of time, this is not for you.  This isn't mainstream pop music.   Like many Pink Floyd albums, this will make you think, and reflect on many  occurences in your life.  Albums such as this are very few, and far  between.  I suggest that you give it a try.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has always liked to surprise, what with his dance anthem 'go' emerging from nowhere in 1990 to amaze us all. Since then his output has had moments of genius, some of the tunes on 'I like to score' for instance,  but many people were wondering if his demonstrably formidable skills were  not being used to their full extent. Well, let me assure you 'GO' is a  return to the top for Moby, it has instantly catchy tracks, while revealing  a surprising depth. I bought 'GO' last August and I'm still appreciating  new aspects of the album, and if it's possible, liking it even more. Moby  has gone to earth for this album and made the sound an earthy, rustic one,  which makes the album far more emotional than his other work. The gospel  singers on 'why does my heart feel so bad?' for instance really tug at your  heartstrings, and the blues samples of 'porcelain' do the same. 'my  weakness', the end track, has a lovely multitude of choirvoices which rise  and fade, and end 'GO' on a really wholesome note (sic). What is apparent  as well, is the seeming effortlessness of Moby's tune and beat abilities.  Many of the songs in this album are so well constructed, it's a very  welcome change from some of the other stuff coming out of the current Dance  Scene. However, you don't have to be into Dance, or Techno, or any other  Genre to enjoy this album. I'm not kidding when I say that 'GO' appeals to  such wide varieties of taste, it's an essential album for the music  conscious person.
6305537313|4.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is the perfect example of what a romantic tale can result in when it concentrat on developing and shaping the main characters before having them persue and desire eachother.<br />The reason I can't give  this film five stars is becase the embarrasing appearance of Mickey Rooney  as a Japanese landlord.  I can not simply toss this asside as a result as  it being dated.  The period this film was made in was one where many great  japanese films were being made.  Point being, Rooney could have easily been  replaced with a real Japanese man.  Surely Rooney does not possess some  comedic skill that no other actor could muster.  It is made far worst by  the fact that he is one of the first images in the film.  <br />Lucky for the  viewer, this character appears infrequently and the charm of the story and  Hepburn shine through.
0552137030|4.0|This is a hilarious take on the end of the world (king james version).  If you're a fan of 'Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy' or don't buy into the whole religion scene, this book is for you.  There were times when I had to  put the book down because I was too busy laughing out loud.  But hurry and  read this book, because the latest news is that Terry Gilliam is going to  be directing the big screen movie version of this book.  And if you don't  know who Terry Gilliam is, then don't read this book.  You will not like  it.  Of course, if you don't like this book, then you have the personality  of a rock.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an awesome book.  It makes you think and puts you inside and gets you involved in the book.  After reading it, I felt great and wanted to read more about Charlie's life.  I recommend this book highly, especially if you are a high school student living a similar  life.
6305358613|4.0|It appears that there are a number of aspects about this film which is not historically accurate, inspite of the fact that the director Shekar Kapur constantly points out that this and that as seen in the film actually  happened.  For those who watch Hollywood films expecting every last detail  to be historically correct are deluding themselves.  I doubt that such a  film exists, since everything is in hindsight and re-interpreted.   That  aside it is still a remarkable film.  The visuals are absolutely stunning  -- in particular the coronation scene. Kapur, brings to life historical  personages and gives them real human personalities and not text-  book-cardboard-cutouts.  Furthermore, I appreciated Kapur's effort in  conveying all the politics, conspiracies, alliances etc that a mononarch  has to tend to in his/her daily life.  This aspect is very well illustrated  by Cate Blanchette in the scene where Elizabeth addresses parliament and  the religious leaders.<br />Okay, it's not 100 percent accurate, but can we  not allow the director some artistic and dramatic license?

630575067X|4.0|The latest entry in the Star Wars list is certainly worthy of being part of the series.  The first film was so &quot;everthing&quot; a movie should be, that the others films and this one have suffered by comparison plus  Phantom Menace had the additonal handicap of having to live up to both the  expectations of fans,plus the hype, both of which were impossible.   Character development is not as strong here as in previous films, and no  clear-cut, all-powerful (almost) villian ala' Darth Vader hurts badly, but  the special effects, especially the pod race,are all any Star War fan could  hope for.  The Jar-Jar Binks character is annoying, yes, but degrading? I  disagree there.  &quot;The Force&quot; assumes more religous/supernatural  overtones than in previous movies.  It does seem to me that Lucas has a lot  of ground to cover to connect Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in only two  more movies, but that is not my problem thankfully.  Since I am not a  hard-core Star War fan, I can and did enjoy this movie, and I would  recommend it to anyone......
0962477060|5.0|Learning guitar is an odd process. You're supposed to practice, practice, practice. You learn chord shapes. You have lessons. You dissect solos note by note. There appears to be no master plan. Somehow, through a variety of  methods, you're supposed to learn. Eventually, you're assured, by some  means you're not aware of yet (osmosis?), you'll &quot;get it.&quot;<br />This  book is the &quot;it&quot; you're supposed to get.<br />Far too many books  assume that the common methods work. Many an aspiring student has put the  guitar in the closet in frustration at something that doesn't address the  basic question - What note do I play next?<br />Bill Edwards has taken the  idea of positional relationships to its highest point. If I play a C chord  with a barre at the eighth fret, where will I find a convenient F and G  position? What shape will I need to play, and what fret should I start  from?<br />This seems to me to be a basic question yet it hardly gets a  mention in most books. It seems that if you practice long enough and don't  get bored to death, you'll know this.<br />Bill Edwards shows that the five  major chord shapes (C, A, G, E, and D) follow as you move up the fretboard,  so you quickly learn that if you're playing a certain shape at a certain  fret, the chords you're going to need will be in a specific other shape a  specific number of frets away.<br />This is independent of what key you're  playing in, so if you start a 12-bar blues with a A-shape, you can drop  down a couple of frets and play an E-shape for the next chord.<br />I've made  it sound far more complex than it is. You'll need the book - make no  mistake - and in just a few hours you'll have learned a huge amount of  useful stuff.<br />But this is just the first seventeen of over a hundred  pages. The idea of positional relationships is used to describe scales and  then the pentatonic blues scale, so you can build solos and know  immediately where the next notes are.<br />Fretboard Logic pulls all the  useful stuff from other learning methods together.

6305622825|4.0|Don't look for &quot;Entrapment&quot; to show up in any awards list, unless the list is one that grades films purely on their entertainment ability, and if that is case, &quot;Entrapment&quot; should score very well  indeed.  Connery is a &quot;retired&quot; art thief, (or is he truly  retired?), Zeta-Jones is an insurance investigator with a VERY interesting  &quot;2nd job&quot;.  The first (and best,in my opinon),007, does his usual  competent job of acting, adding a definite touch of professionalism here.   There has been some criticisms of Zeta-Jones' acting, which I think is  unfair.  Her parts, so far, have consisted of mostly  &quot;window-dressing&quot;so she hasn't really been given a chance to  stretch. Her acting here is certainly &quot;meets the requirements&quot;  and her beauty is undeniable. The training scenes, the theft sequences are  excellent and although this film, nor its cast are not going to win any  Oscars, it was never intended to be that kind of movie. It's not  &quot;cinema&quot;, its a movie, and a very entertaining one at that.....
6304602898|3.0|If you've never seen the film: Gremlins is very barely a horror flick, though, ironically, it had the most to do with the invention of the PG13 rating in 1984.  There is an excessive number of pointless sightgags [and a few subtle and clever ones, including A BOY'S LIFE playing at the cinema]  and childish sound effects.  Kids *over* thirteen will be insulted by a lot  of this film.<br />That aside, it was a fairly original idea...which has been  exploited everywhere else, since; you might as well see where it  began.<br />Regarding the DV: the missing scenes [Reinhold locking himself in  the safe, et cetera] aren't on the disc, which is disappointing; the best  parts of the film have been removed, and can't be found anywhere right now.   The DV also passed on the obvious chance to include a desktop theme for  DVRoms, which might have been amusing.<br />As for the gremlins  themselves--since that's what I'm apparently some sort of expert  on--they're far more interesting than the one who beat up Bugs Bunny; but  the best gremlin I've seen was in the cinematic Twilight Zone  release.<br />Gremlins is a fun escape from life for ninety minutes; suspend  disbelief, and any problemsolving ability you may have, and you'll be  fine.<br />--Gremlin
B000001GQY|5.0|I think these are the best performances of Brahms' two piano concertos I've ever heard.  Russian pianist Emil Gilels originally recorded both concertos with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Eugen Jochum in 1972.  (Jochum considered these to be among the finest recordings he ever made.)  Both concertos and Brahms' &#34;Fantasien,&#34;  Op. 116 were re-released  as a two-CD set,  part of  the Deutsche Grammophon label's  &#34;Originals&#34; series, in 1996.  All are played with the poetry,  majesty, passion and power for which Brahms was noted.  The remastered  sound is absolutely outstanding.  Awarded a three-star rating by the  &#34;Penguin Guide to Compact Discs,&#34; this two-CD set should not be  missed my any fan of Brahms' music.
0792844602|5.0|I loved this movie since I first saw it as a child (it was already a classic then). Do not confuse this movie with the made-for-TV version starring Beau Bridges. John Clements was in his prime when he starred as  A.E.W. Mason's anti-war hero Faversham. The photography, shot on location,  has withstood the test of time. My only regret is that movie is not being  released on DVD.

B000002UBU|4.0|Don McLean's American Pie is an odd record indeed.  The 8 minute plus title song is a bonafide classic for the vaults, containing some of the most lyrically creative elusions ever contained in a musical chord  progression.   What's even more intruiging is &quot;Vincent&quot;, a  descriptive, immensely poetic, haunting song inspired by Van Gogh's  painting Starry Night.  McLean's voice conveys a desperate attempt to  connect to the past and understand Van Gogh's genius without over  dramaticizing.       &quot;Empty Chairs&quot; is a dark, stripped down  piano piece that McLean uses to exercise his sensitive, reflective lyrics  with simplistic bass piano chords. The contrast works well, and gives  McLean a haunting sound.    There are moments when the record fizzles, in  particular &quot;Everybody Loves Me Baby&quot;, which if you listen  closely, uses almost the same chord progression as the title song, just at  a different beat, not to mention McLean's awful attempt at Dylanesque  lyricism.   At times the recording seems too produced and straight forward,  especially on Babylon, which is something out of an elementary school music  education class, ala Mary Had A Little Lamb. McLean's influences throughout  are obvious, as he sometimes sounds like a replica of Pete Seeger, both  vocally and lyrically.   But as far as it goes for singer-songwriters, Don  McLean struggled long and hard and came up with a winner.
B00002Z88D|1.0|I must admit I was open to the idea of Metallica with a symphony. The symphony could boost their power and bring metal into a whole a new world. Then I heard the album. Metallica, as talented as they are, lack the  discipline to stay on beat with an orchestra. With the band trying  desperately to stay on beat, the orchestra keeps on going, kinda. This has  to be Kamen's worest work ever. The orchestra was just annoying. It added  no power and just made a mockery of both cultures, the symphony and metal.  Cliff Burton has to have turned over in his grave at this one, that is if  he didn't already turn from reload. If you want classical Metallica, I urge  you to check out Apocalyptica.
B000002H97|5.0|It is hard to believe this album came out in 1991.  The Black Album is Metallica's best; past, present, and future.  I must've listened to this CD a million times and never get tried of it.  If you don't have this album  yet, you're not a true 'tallica fan.  If you do have this CD already, buy  another one and put it away for the grandkids.  They'll love it, too in  2091.
0312853238|5.0|When I picked up Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card I really didn't know what to expect. By the time I finished the first chapter I found my self hooked on the story. Card puts together an amazing cast, and weaves an  addictive plot around them. When I read a book I look for at least one  character the I feel for. With Ender, the main character, I found just  that. From the first page to the last Card makes Ender more and more human,  and all the while he puts him into almost inhuman situations. I actually  found myself rooting him on aloud. Needless to say I got a few strange  looks from people around me at the time. But that just showed me how easy a  character Ender is to emphamize with. In the time since I got, and  finished, Ender's Game I have already bought the other four books in the  series. I honestly have never read a book that literally made me not want  to put it down. I can't wait to read the rest.
B000002G87|5.0|Some albums that I really dug in the Sixties have not aged very well (Sgt. Peppers is one).  Others just get better and better (Exile on Main Street).  &quot;Layla&quot; is another.  It exudes energy, artistry, integrity,  suffering, passion.  I don't know exactly what was going on in 1969 and 70  for so many great albums to come out, but this is certainly one of the  greatest (along with Abbey Road, in my opinion).  Just a shame the  recording quality isn't as good as Abbey Road.  But a 77 minute album is  perfect for CD!  (Note: if you want to make a copy, you've got to get an 80  minute CD blank).
6302878527|5.0|If not the best, one of the best boy-girl/date films ever. Audrey and Albert are perfect in their rolls; Donnen's direction is with a light hand, and perfect. Even the music does not seem dated. Audrey's wardrobe is c.  1970 ultra chic - and still looks great. The changing time frames are very  creative and best tells the story. Also fun to see Wiliam Daniels and  others in great supporting work. Great color showing off the French  scenery, and it's fun to see those cars again!
6302098440|4.0|Absolutely not historically defensible in any sense, but a first class 20th Century Fox foray into the world of King Arthur and his Viking foes.  A youthful Robert Wagner wins the double whammy. He becomes a knight after  killing King Arthur's treacherous enemy in single combat whilst also  regaining the throne of Scandia for his family.  The triumph of good over  evil is personified by the victory of Christianity over paganism.  What  makes this film a &quot;must&quot; is the music of Franz Waxman who  captures all the contrasting moods from humor to tragedy and from disaster  to triumph. The attack on Slygon's fortress is unique in movie history as  both sides get drenched with inflammable liquid released from pig skins.  Barricade the gates!
B000000WFF|5.0|After the release of their chart topping debut album there was much sceptisism on whether or not the Spice Girls could hit number 1 again or become forgotten 1-hit-wonders. Not only did they hit number 1 again, they  topped themselves. This album has done EXTREMLY well, and its easy to see  why. The album kicks off with the Spice Girls first single off this album  &quot;SPICE UP YOUR LIFE.&quot; This is an outrageously awesome song  inviting all the world to get up on the dance floor and shake it! A really  fun song. Next comes &quot;STOP&quot; which is the Spice Girls tribute to  Motown. And what a tribute! This song is wonderfull and so much fun. Its a  shame it didn't get to number 1 on the charts, but number 2 is just as  good. Then comes &quot;TOO MUCH&quot; another number 1 hit for the Spice  Girls. And its easy to see why, the awesome lyrics and the melody itself is  just amazing. Not to mention that it dosn't get into silly mushy garbage  that often happens with ballads (Backstreet Boys much?). Then theres  &quot;SATURDAY NIGHT DIVAS&quot; which happens to be my least favorite  Spice Girls song. Its sounds like they just came out of the ghetto,  allthough not an entirly bad song. The comes my favorite, &quot;NEVER GIVE  UP ON THE GOOD TIMES.&quot; What an outrageous song, the disco beat is  great and the harmonies rock. I love this song! Then theres the world  famous &quot;MOVE OVER&quot; or otherwise known as Generation Next. I love  seeing them perform this song and even though its not as good, the album  version rocks! Even if it is the Pepsi song. Next comes &quot;DO IT.&quot;  Now &quot;DO IT&quot; and &quot;DENYING&quot; (the next song) tend to be  the forgotten tracks on this album. While not the best songs on the album  they are most definetly not the worst. I rather like them and love seeing  the Girls stage them. Next comes a favorite of mine, &quot;VIVA  FOREVER,&quot; the oh-so-sweet ballad. The simplicity and beauty of this  song brings tears tothe eye, I just love it. The final song on the album,  &quot;LADY IS A VAMP,&quot; tends to get knocked a little. Why? Its fun and  I loved it the first time I heard it. Besides, where else can you hear Geri  carrying a song so well? I like it, its cute. All in all, this album is a  must. Even those who don't like cute pop can find somthing to enjoy in  SPICEWORLD. Besides, what else are you gonna listen to? Kid Rock? Korn?  BOO! The Spice Girls write their own lyrics, perform hamronies, dance, and  are alot of fun. This album is a credit to their name.
6305807086|5.0|ok, so you end up on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike instead, after your &quot;trip&quot;, Alice ( or Al, if you prefer) ... Still, there's that same odd perception of a distorted reality ( and oooo, that teeny  little door, just like in the real Wonderland stories! ...and oooo, that  long tunnel..just like in the origionals also! ) which we must accept that  comes right from the childhood fairy tale.  Nobody in this movie seems to  be &quot;getting&quot; anybody else right from the start...I found this  aspect hysterical and trippy.  Mary Kay Place, as the secretary for--was  that Orson Bean? , incapable of understanding PLAIN ENGLISH, is the symbol  in this movie of the totally screwed and skewed vision we are being  entertained with. John Cusak, perfect, as always.  Cameron Diaz, really  adeptly strange.  I am impressed she is willing to do these comedy parts  that take her out of the realm of just being a beauty.<br /> I found extremely  funny that fact that no one could remember any of the the productions that  Malcovich has been in. I mean, here is a top actor, and yet.. somehow,  there is some truth to this.  That John M. was willing to goof on that was  fun.  Additionally, John Malcovich &quot;processing himself&quot; was  actually sort of philosophically cool, because in the long run...we can  only take in what our own minds DO perceive, right?  And so, therefore,  that makes it ALL ABOUT US, right?  Well, am I RIGHT, or am I THGIR?  You  tell ME.  Uoy llet EM.<br />best wishes,<br />Naej
B000002JS6|5.0|These were the good old days for AC/DC.  Back when Brian Johnson's voice was a crisp scream and the band played with amazing energy!  Every song on here is fantastic, there's not much more to say.  Hey, the band is still  great--but the days of  energy and crisp voices have come and gone very  quickly.
0060273224|5.0|Sabreil is a book that takes you to a whole new world, but keeps some real-life details.The book begins slow(I think) but takes off after a couple of chapters when Sabreil has to journey into death to save her father, picking up two friends along the way(Mogget-a demon thing trapped  inside the form of a cat and touchstone-a man who was a royal guard before  being trapped in death.)This book is filled with fun,adventure, and a  little romance. All the condiments of a great book.
B000000OSG|5.0|This is a masterpiece! Guns N'Roses show an amazing talent for making complicated but still very rocking music. They stick to the same basic style throughout this double album, but they explore several corners of it.  They experiment without ever forgetting what it's all about: great rock  music!<br />It's one of these albums that you listen to year after year, and  you keep discovering new things. Your favourite songs change over the  years. »Civil War« was always a favourite of mine, but nowadays a good  rocker like »Pretty Tied Up« has climbed up the hitlist as well. Then  there's the honest »Get In The Ring«, the smasher »You Could Be Mine«, the  nearly folky »Breakdown«... and so on, and so on.<br />The two »Use Your  Illusion« double albums belong in everyone's music collection.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|Everyone should like this movie.  It has action with fight scenes that are chillingly realistic without being bogged down with scripted, choreography, but also has a substantial plot with a an ending analogous to that of Dr.  Strangelove, or the Usual Suspects.  I hope that the critical jabbering  that it was too violent doesn't scare anyone off, as anyone who takes this  as a purely violent theme movie missed the point entirely.  This is a must  see movie in the category of Apocalypse Now or the afformentioned Dr.  Strangelove.
1573228214|5.0|5.  It's named after an Elvis Costello Song.<br />4.  Nick Hornby perfectly nails the obsessed music fan's persona and shows how this obsession spills over into destroying and forming relationships.<br />3.  Hornby's prose is like a good pop song --engaging, lyrical, instantly recognizable and  memorable.<br />2.  It's funny as hell.<br />1.  It's not JUST funny as hell.   It's original, insightful, and full of highly developed characters.
B00004KD1L|5.0|Groove Armada keeps you guessing on every track - sometimes rapping, sometimes grooving, sometimes mellow trance, always soulful. They basically took industrial beats, slowed the tempo on some of the songs, and brought  in a random lot of singers/MC's and made a great eclectic mix. For tapping  into so many influence, the duo come up with a wonderfully synchopated  sound. Very unique!
B00004S6GL|5.0|Brilliant album.  Elliott Smith is an amazing artist...whether with an acoustic guitar and a 4 track recorder or with the heavenly hosts of Dreamworks, he is foremost. This album is good the first time you hear it,  and then it gets better.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I work at a video store.  I've seen hundreds of films.  This film...was by far one of the best I've seen this year.  I would go as far as to say that this film deserved more nominations than BEST SOUND, I mean give me a break!  David Fincher's film had one of the wittiest scripts that I  personally would have given it a nomination ath the Academy Awards.  It  stands out as one of five great scripts that we'll ever see transformed  onto the screen from this past year.  The other four: American Beauty  (obviously), Election, The Insider, and Magnolia.  Each of these writers  are geniuses in their own right.  Now, to explain my review title: I rented  this from my work and about 30 minutes into the film, the picture went  black &amp; white.  Most of you would say, &quot;I'm going to go take this  back and get another copy.&quot;  &quot;HELL NO! &quot;  This movie grabbed  me by my shirt and beat the **** out of me with it's raw feel and it's  dark, witty, inventive script and direction.  I wouldn't dare shut it off.   I was enthralled by it.  Entertainment doesn't get much better than this.   So I sat through another hour and 30 sum minutes and enjoyed the hell out  of it!  I guarantee, you will too.
6300214753|5.0|&quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot;is a movie about living life to its fullest.Matthew Broderick is Ferris Bueller,a 17 year old highschooler who decides to skip school one sunny day.In realizing it is his 9th sick day in  a semester,he figures he'd better make it worthwhile.So, he heads downtown  Chicago with his semi-neurotic best friend Cameron(Alan Ruck)and His  girlfriend Sloane(Mia Sara)in Cameron's dad's expensive red ferrari.They  visit an art museum,go to a fancy restaurant for lunch,and attend a  parade,where Ferris raids a float.Jennifer Grey is perfect as  Jeannie,Ferris's jealous older sister.Jeffrey Jones is Ed Rooney,the Dean  of Students whose one wish is to destroy Ferris.And Edie McClurg is  hilarious as Grace,Rooney's halfwit secretary.A hilarious film with lots of  laughs and an excellent cast!
6305622825|5.0|I thought that this movie was better than The Thomas Crown Affair.  The acting was better and there was more action all around.  I believe that the same script must have been used in both movies there were so many  likenesses.<br />First, it involved a theft of a painting and a insurance  worker trying to catch the crook- second it involved a secret hideaway (a  castle instaed of a place by the beach as in TCA) and finally some good old  fashioned double cross.<br />What made this movie stand out was the fact that  it did not revolve around the theft of one item, but at least 3 different  ones.  The action scenes were better and I feel the acting was better  also.<br />The odd thing about both movies was the fact that the main  characters both played James Bond and now there are breaking the law-  ironic.  This is a good and fun filled movie.
B00004SVID|5.0|Pink Floyd's The Wall has to rank among the top half dozen or so musical landmarks of the last half century. Dark Side of the Moon is probably a better album, but The Wall holds its own in terms of experimentation and innovation(sometimes flawed but overall undeniably great)<br />Having been but  a little baby when Floyd stopped touring, Ive always wanted to get my hands  on a live version of The Wall...and its finally out!<br />I ordered the album  as soon as it came out..but thats coz Im a die hard fan. If you are new to  Floyd, then I suggest you start with Dark Side and only buy this if you  crave for more Floyd(Like I did!)
B000001Y79|5.0|This might be my favorite No Doubt CD ever.  It has a wonderful blend of songs, and they all come from Gwen's heart.  This is such a great Cd, a must have.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|...and with LONDON CALLING, the British &quot;punk&quot; (here of all places, the term seems absurdly restrictive) group stretched out and absorbed musical styles as diverse as the listeners this crowning album  would come to captivate (which audience came to include the countless  parents - and grandparents - of college-aged Clash fans who found their  elders at odd moments singing and/or dancing to key tracks). Legendary  producer Guy Stevens (since deceased) rode herd over the band during  production, night after night, as tempers frayed - and helped squeeze from  them one of the signature albums of the rock era. From the  blood-and-thunder howl of Joe Strummer on the title-track opener, to the  infectious melody and winning vocals of Mick Jones on the final, originally  unlisted &quot;Train in Vain,&quot; the songs here assembled range  musically across ska, reggae, punk, roots rock and rockabilly, and  lyrically embody the band's trademark obsessions: the Jamaican - and  American Western - outlaw tradition, Hollywood and its larger-than-life  mythmaking, the oppressions of class and exhilarating risks of defiance,  corporate commercialism and the co-opting of authenticity, the  transmutation of anger into art. The whole work, when all is said, just  plain *rocks*, with a density of propulsive energy that will have even the  most jaded among us throwing away their crutches, on their feet and  sweating happily to their favorite tracks. As those who wore out their  original cassette copies over a decade ago will agree.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This is the best album ever! It has got something in it and I can't describe it. Music is sometimes beautiful and sometimes it's scary. Sometimes it's so great that I imagine myself singing it.<br />This album  includes a lot of influences and borrowings of Carmina Burana. It's great  in couple of songs, but Michael should create something own!<br />&quot;Push  the Limits&quot; is great, but it is 6 minutes long! Too long and boring I  think, but you will love it. It would be better if it would be 3 minutes  long! &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; is very beautiful and impressive. Lyrics  are beautiful and voice of Ruth-Ann is something I can't describe. Celine  Dion, you have a rival! &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; is very cool song. It  is different from the other songs in this album. &quot;Traces (Light and  Weight)&quot; is even more beautiful music than James Horner's music in  Titanic Soundtrack. Always when I listen to it I start thinking somekind of  beautiful garden... Don't know why! &quot;A Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;  is such a great music and it has got inside it lyrics from the other Enigma  songs and musics too. Great mix! &quot;Between Mind and Heart&quot; is sure  hit single! &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot; has got a little  pop-music-alike elements in it and the lyrics are something you can't  forget! Great ending.<br />I love this album! I'm not the biggest fan of  classical music, but this is something I can't describe. Best music ever!  <br />I can't rate this album, because I couldn't give it stars enough. Even  the stars in the sky aren't enough!
B00003CWN2|5.0|We all know by know that Hilary Swank won a Best Actress role for her turn as Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, but what many still don't realize is that every single person in the cast deserved at least a nomination.<br />People  who complain that it's a simplistic story glorifying lesbianism miss the  point. It's about class issues rather than sex; the people of this town are  stuck in lives they hate but can't escape. All the while, cross-dresser  Brandon is in their midst, attempting to live out the life she feels she  must. Ms. Swank is extremely credible when she tries to pass herself off as  a boy, and Chloë Sevigny's just fantastic as Brandon's girlfriend Lana, who  doesn't want to see the truth at first, and ultimately doesn't care even  though she sees herself as heterosexual.<br />I'm not aware, personally, of  how well the movie tracks the real-life events that inspired it. But  director Kimberly Peirce has created something so sublime and transcendent  and haunting as to become a modern-day legend.
B000002GQE|5.0|I had already owned the greatest hits of the Moody Blues when I bought this album.  When I got it, I had already known &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; and &quot;Tuesday Afternoon,&quot; but wanted to hear some  other Moody Blues songs as well.  The first time I listened to it, I was  blown away!   This album contains so many soothing and great songs, such as  &quot;Twilight Time,&quot; &quot;Dawn is a Feeling,&quot; and &quot;Another  Morning.&quot;  This album has actually gotten me to buy other albums as  well.  Also, it was interesting to read the liner notes, stating that this  was actually a demonstration album for a new recording technology, and the  Moody Blues were the demonstrators, along with Peter Knight and the London  Symphony Orchestra.  Who would have ever known that this &quot;demo&quot;  album would become the Moody Blues best selling album of their careers and  yield their biggest hit (&quot;Nights&quot;).  Great job, Moodies and Peter  Knight!
630018403X|5.0|This movie very accurately describes the trials and tribulations of five very different teenagers. Each of the five teens has critical issues that effect him or her and its is very interesting how each individual brings  can bring out reactions from the rest of the group.  Its almost like a teen  therapy session and in the end, each person seems to learn from one  another.  Judd Nelson gives a real killer performance as a troubled teen  trying to find happiness in a world that does nothing but dump on him.  His  humor seems to make him strong and impresses Molly Ringwald in the end.  Its intersting to watch these five as well as the teacher and custodian  evolve over the course of the movie.  The depth of this movie plus aspects  of both drama and comedy make The Breakfast Club one of my all time  favorites.
B00003CXBK|5.0|As an avid anime watcher and manga reader, I must say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best. The storyline is strong, and the animation..... Even my critical family loved it.<br />Prince Ashitaka  from a almost-cleaned-out clan kills a attacking deamon, finding that it is  a boar driven from anger into a tarugami. He sets out to find a cure to the  curse the boar placed on him, and stumbles on Iron Town. He learns that the  mistress is good, yet evil, and that a war is raging between the Gods and  the people of Iron Town. It is he, cursed as he is, to find a way to stop  the fighting.<br />The story goes on to include characters with highly  described profiles, and more complicated animation. This deserves six  stars.
6305750750|3.0|I wanted this to be a good movie just like anybody else, but there were just too many inconsistencies for me to enjoy it.<br />1.  What happend to Uncle Owen?  In the original Star Wars (Episode IV), Luke is staying with  his Uncle Owen.  From what we have seen in Episode I, neither Queen Amidala  nor Anakin have any siblings; therefore, where does Uncle Owen come from.   (Granted this may be solved in the next episode...we shall see.)<br />2.  In  the original trilogy, Obi Wan speaks often of how Yoda was his master and  trained him in the Jedi ways...now we find out that it was Qui Gon Jinn and  not Yoda.  Why the sudden change?<br />3.  In the entire trilogy, midi  chlorians were never mentioned once.  If they exist inside everyone and  make up a Jedi, don't you think Yoda would have used this to explain the  force to Luke?   It would have helped Luke understand the force...but no,  they suddenly appear from nowhere.  (My brother informs me that they are  mentioned in the books, but the books were also written after the trilogy.   Why do these things change?)<br />4.  We learn from Episode I that Emperor  Palpatine is a Sith...why was this never mentioned in the trilogy?  It  seems important to mention as to why he can shoot electricity from his  finger tips...and yet it was never stated in the original trilogy.<br />These  are a few of the inconsistencies I have noticed.  In addition to this,  there are many problems that I have with the movie itself.  There wasn't  much chemistry between the actors.  In the trilogy, we fall in love with  Han, Luke, Leia, and Chewey.  It is obvious that they care about each other  and they fight for each other.  In Episode I, we don't have this.  The  comedy was also very weak.  In the trilogy, there were times when we  laughed at all four of the main characters.  In Episode I, Jar Jar Binks  seems to be the only comic relief and to me his jokes seem to be a little  childish and immature.  Also, what lessons do we learn from Episode I?   &quot;There's always a bigger fish.&quot;  In the trilogy, we heard all of  Yoda's words of wisdom and learned to look to ourself and not just wish for  things to happen.  This was completely lacking from Episode I.  This  amazingly is only a shortened list of the many things I have found to be  lacking from Episode I.  Hopefully, Episodes II and III will bring  everything back up to par...but i'm doubtful at this time.  The special  effects were amazing, but they can't make up for the lack of plot.  I  thought Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman did a wonderful  job...and they are the only thing that is saving this movie.<br />If you  haven't seen it, it's worth watching once, but don't get caught on all the  hype...be objective...it's not that good.
B000001IPL|5.0|Totally the best cd I have ever purchased. Every song could be a hit. After buying this cd i had to buy all the rest of offspring and it was worth it. This is truly music you can rock to. Never a dull moment. If you  want the best of offspring &quot;or even punk rock&quot; get this cd. It's  worth every last penny. There are no other cd's that even match this one or  are anything like it. A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE STARTING ROCK or WANTING  SOMETHING NEW THATS NOT AS MUCH SLOW POP ROCK. Everyone should get this cd.  !
B000001Y79|5.0|I love this album! It's upbeat sound and mega-bass is great for driving and dancing. I highly recommend it to anyone. Pop it in when you're having a bad day, and that frown really will turn up-side-down!
B00002DESX|5.0|All the bands that claim to be punk today owe alot to THE RAMONES who paved the way for these so called Punk Rock Bands that are all over the radio today. While most of these bands may go on to make more money and sell more albums than THE RAMONES one thing is for sure, they'll never be half as good as THE RAMONES. While I can respect alot of bands that followed THE RAMONES punk Rock Carpet I will always believe NONE of them will touch that nerve that just makes you want to listen over and over again till you're deaf in the ears. Like the influential IGGY AND THE STOOGES before them THE RAMONES were signed to a major label. A subsidiary of the Warner Brothers label, the new label at the time SIRE. Recorded in 1976 at Radio City Music Hall this is the album that features THE RAMONES at their rawest. With classics like BLITZKRIEG BOP, BEAT ON THE BRAT, NOW I WANNA SNIFF SOME GLUE and 53rd and 3rd, this is the Essential Album for someone who has never heard THE RAMONES before and wants to give them a listen. The Recording is raw even though they actually recorded it track by track and not Live which probably didn't capture their live sound but subsequent albums after this one caught that sound. Of course this has been re-released through RHINO records with additional demo tracks. I'd reccommend that version over this one.
B00003ZA0T|5.0|I haven't heard the import but the regular version is the best cd i've ever heard.
0783239408|5.0|Perspective is the key to this movie.  Just when you think you know what you are seeing, it changes and you see it from a new perspective.  We were fortunate enough to see the movie and have a Q and A session with Kevin Spacey afterwards in the theatre.  He and this movie are fantastic.
B000031XCR|5.0|Okay, so I'll be sincere, this album isn't any better than &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot;. But, hey, they're both as GREAT! Except for one really bad song on this album - &quot;I Want You To Need Me&quot;, by Diane  Warren who wrote &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; (gasp!), which is really  suggestive and lacks Celine's deserving substance - all the other songs on  this swansong are brilliant!<br />I'm glad they included &quot;Because You  Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;To Love You  More&quot;, because those tunes really amplify her powerful voice  optimumly. But I was really pleased with the R. Kelly duet &quot;I'm Your  Angel&quot;, because I really love the song, and I couldn't get it on  MP3!<br />That's the &quot;Best Of...&quot; part, but wait till you get a  listen on the new tracks! Of course there's &quot;That's The Way It  Is&quot; - great tune and lyrics - and other equally merit songs like  &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; (a melody flowing through sweet loving  secrets) and &quot;Live&quot; (seriously uplifting). But my all time  favourite track - and this is what I'll remember her for - is the duet with  Frank Sinatra, &quot;All The Way&quot;. She sings so smoothly through the  synthesis of voices from two of the greatest singers, that it honestly  moved me to tears (not even &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; could do  that!). And that romatic last line was one of her classic  &quot;endings&quot;, along with &quot;The Prayer&quot;.<br />So, like she  serenades in that wonderful last line, my heart goes out to you, Celine  (come back soon!). &quot;I'm gonna love you, ALL THE WAY...&quot;.

0688062334|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best book I have ever read.  I read it first when I was about 12 and have loved it ever since.  It is the story of Sophie, the eldest of three sisters who believes that she will never do anything with her life.  Through a case of mistaken identity she is  transformed into an elderly woman and is forced to leave her old life to  seek her fortune in the world.  She bullies her way into a magical castle  owned by the wizard Howl. Sophie makes friends with Howl's assistant  Michael and his Fire Demon Calcifer and together they help Howl to beat the  wicked Witch of the Waste. The best thing about this book is the writing,  which brings it all to life, particularly when Howl takes Sophie and  Michael to visit his sister in Wales.  The whole book is fantastic and I  have now read it so many times I think I will have to buy a new copy as the  old one is looking decidedly the worse for wear. I would recommend this  book for anyone who has read other stories by the same author or anyone who  just wants to read something exciting and entertaining.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This remarkable film caused my husband and me to do 2 amazing things. First, we allowed our 13 year old daughter to go out to a movie with us on a school night, and second, when we found out it was only going to be  released on DVD at first, we ran out to buy a DVD player and a TV that was  DVD compatable!  I am not going to go in to detail about the film, because  it has all been said here by others. Just buy it!  It is worth it.
B00000064G|5.0|You ever notice how things just happen?  I don't know exactly how I stumbled upon Nick Drake. Someone mentioned his music while discussing depression.  And that is especially true of this album. I have been going  through battles with my own demons. And part of my healing is cornering  these demons head on, and confronting them, literally getting inside them.  For it is by awareness of them that each time I confront them, I take away  a little of their power over me.  It's painful, and frustrating, and a bit  scary.  That's what this album is about.  Sometimes very sad, and full of  introspection. Was it a cry for help?  Or just observing that which is the  human condition?  This CD has given me solace and comfort. It's ironic, a  pain I can feel now Nick Drake felt almost 30 years ago.  It's very little  piano, his guitar, and his voice.  Why did this CD come into my life? Why  are you reading this review about it this very second?  The answer to both  is a resounding I don't know. So buy it and let self-reflection into your  life.
6305807086|4.0|Those literary works and films seemed to be the directors' and writers influences.The idea of a portal leading to some alternate reality(alice in wonderland).The ability to experience someone elses  experience(brainstorm).And the lowly puppeteer who seeks comfort and  companionship in his toys(pinnochio).The movie had multiple messages that  were often times funny and disturbing.What i think it was saying is how we  are manipulated by our environment and the people in them.In a perpetual  state of confusion that only seems to make any sense when we give ourselves  over or are controlled by someone else and then wondering when the  experience is over how things have gotten worse.It's also a meditation on  individuals compulsive need to live vicariously through someone else.The  very act of watching a movie is a vicarious experience in itself.Instead of  a movie within in a movie,this was more like a vicarious experience within  an vicarious experience within an vicarious experience.What i was left with  above all else was that if you pretend to be someone else you can't or  won't be held accountable for &quot;your&quot; actions.
6305750750|5.0|This is the widescreen edition and it is very nice.  I was only watching it on a 19&quot; screen, so the image was kind of small but it was still very nice.<br />I won't talk about the Star Wars movie itself, because most  people have either seen it or don't want to.  If you haven't seen it, but  enjoy other Star Wars movies, are a Sci-Fi person, or like action and  special effects, you'll like The Phantom Menace.  I only had a cheap stereo  system and a 2-head mono VCR to watch it on, but it was nice.  I imagine  that sound on a good Dolby Surround Sound system would be good.<br />It comes  in a nice collector's box.  However, the packaging is thin cardboard and  I'm sure I'll step on it soon enough and it will be ruined.<br />The film  cells are a nice bonus. (I got pictures of the underwater city).  They come  in a small paper frame and you can hold it up to the light to see what you  have.<br />It comes with an excerpt from the Art of Star Wars book.  Once  again, a nice bonus.  It has a lot of pictures and interesting  facts.<br />It's too bad it's not on DVD because then you'd have the  Six-Channel Dolby Digital Sound and an even crisper picture.  The tape is  good quality, and even when pausing, the picture is sharp.  If you're  waiting for DVD, don't wait.  It won't be until 2003 or later when it'll  come out on DVD.<br />Overall, if you've seen it on the big screen, you'll  enjoy it on the small screen.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This is truly as good as music gets these days. Zack de la Rocha lyrics embody RATM's political message, while not making it just a preachy complaint.  Tom Morello's guitar sounds are truly amazing. All twelve of  the songs on this album ROCK. The best ones are &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot;  and &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;. &quot;War Within a Breath&quot;,  &quot;Testify&quot;, and &quot;Maria&quot; are also great.   What makes  this album better than stuff like Korn, Kid Rock, or Limp Bizkit, is that  it's more organized, not just slapped down, with all different kinds of  song lyrics, it's a carefully created blend of hard rock and powerful  lyrics.
0307165485|5.0|I had a hard time finding this book for my daughter and finally came across it in a used bookstore.  This is such a wonderful book; the stories are varied and the pictures, as always with Richard Scarry, are just  beautiful.  I enjoy having volumes like this with many stories  included...sometimes we don't even read the text, but just talk about  what's in the pictures.
0425129586|5.0|I found this book to be captivating.  For anyone interested in reading it, I suggest choosing a character in the book who you think is the murderer.  I did this and thought until the very end that I was right - I had Agatha Christie all figured out after reading her for the first time. This book  was memorable to me because I really didn't have it all figured out - I was  dead wrong!  Try it for yourself.
0553296981|5.0|A lot has been said about &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot;  Some people have even claimed that it is a fake, which is an outrageous claim that denigrates those who died in the Holocaust and those that survived.  This book is testament to a child's spirit and humanity as she hides in  ever deteriorating circumstances with her family in an attic over an office  in Amsterdam.  We are witnesses to her first kiss with Peter a boy also in  hiding, and her stormy relationship with her mother which she tries to  resolve often unsuccessfully.  We see flares of brilliance as she tries to  understand human nature as well as the innocence of youth when she says,  &quot;basically I believe most people are good.&quot;  The Diary of Anne  Frank would probably be just an ordinary young girl's memoirs if the  Holocaust had not happened.  However the Holocaust did happen and Anne  Frank's diary stands for all the young girls whose lives were ended before  they had a chance to blossom.  If any book was to be made compulsory  reading in schools then this book should be it.  Through Anne Frank we will  never forget her humanity or for that matter our own.
6305426651|5.0|&quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is the best film ever by Roberto Benigni because he tangles a very dark and serious subject, the Holocaust, and comes out with a movie that makes us smile and laugh as well as cry. The  attacks on this movie are senseless by people who don't really get it.  &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is not a Holocaust movie, Spielberg already  did the best we've seen in showing the Nazi horrors with &quot;Schindler's  List,&quot; &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is about a father's love for his  son and his determination to save him. It's a father son story more than a  Holocaust film. The comedy here is brilliant because it flows smoothly with  the story, it elevates it and seems real and not some sitcom monologue. The  story is sweet, moving, sometimes a little dark, but in the end it drives  the viewer to tears. The performances are superb because this is a superb  movie with spirit. It has a great feeling, it uplifts your spirits.  &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is a must-see, brilliant movie.
0767836286|5.0|'Arlington Road' is a heart pumping thriller. Tim Robbins adds all the excitement and fun. I am gravely dissapointed that I missed this one in the theatres. Jeff Bridges is great as the paranoid college professor, but Tim  Robbins is the one to marvel at. Joan Cusack is good too. Who cares if it  got mixed reviews, take my word, if you are a fan of creepy thrillers, you  are going to love it!
B00000K2SC|5.0|I loved this movie! It had excellent special effects and sound, but I am upset at the people who didn't like it just because of Keanu Reeves.  I admit, he isn't the best actor in the world, but with the help of Lawrence  Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, he is awesome.  His lines, short as they are  are totally cool.  I especially liked&quot;Guns.  Lots of guns.&quot;  and  when they're in the subway,&quot;You're empty.  So are you.&quot;  This is  excellent and I reccomend it to everyone.P.S.  I personally like Keanu  Reeves alot.
B000002UAU|5.0|Having been recorded ten years before I was even born, i feel almost a bit out of place even commenting on the genius behing &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot;, but i'll give it the old college try! Probably one of the most influential  albums of all time, &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot; has forever changed music AND  popular culture.  It was so ahead of its time, its almost sickening.  How  could so much have happened because of one record album?  Well, for one,  the already most popular band in the world had seemingly done it all at the  time of this recording.  Most artists, in terms of musical growth, stagnate  at the kind of success these four guys had come upon.  But what did they  do?  They looked outside their celebrity world through different eyes.   They saw the world through ravi shankar, lsd, and the new culture in both  the UK and the US.  It was a new life, and the Beatles were ale to grasp  what was happening around them better perhaps than anyone else.  That is  why this album is so fresh even today.  Because they were honest with the  world around them at the time of recording.  It is this connection with  their surroundings that allowed them to express their own feelings  flawlessly through this album.   Aside from their personal experiences,  this album is commendable from a technological standpoint as well.  Music  engineers still marvel at the fact that it was recorded on just 2 four  track machines.  A stunning achievement to say the least.  This record has  changed so many perspectives on popular culture, including my own.  Its a  decade older than me, but just as much a part of my life as any album of  the nineties.
630575067X|5.0|Episode I was not as good as the original Star Wars trilogy. However, with the exception of Jar Jar Binks and his clumsiness, it was a highly enjoyable movie. My favorite scences were the pod race and the final lightsaber battle (and the space battles were pretty cool, too). Anyway, I reccomend this video. Unlike others, I didn't think the VHS quality was poor at all. But I am still looking forward to the DVD.
6300214435|5.0|This movie was pure magic when I was 8 and now retains a nostalgic place in my heart and fond memories of childhood.  Although when I saw it the rating was PG-13 (which made me seeing it all the more cooler, since I was  forbidden to see anything over PG at the time by my parents).  This is  actually a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark and starts with Indy being  tricked into drinking poison in Shanghai (while picking up the young Kate  Capshaw) then we're treated to an emergency crash landing in a lifeboat,  right in the heart of India, and a village that is in need of some serious  help, Indy style.  The village's sacred stone that kept it alive and  prosperous has been stolen as well as all of its children.  It's up to Indy  to save them, with the help of his young sidekick, Short Round (I have no  idea what the name means).  The violence in this one is a lot darker and  less comic than in Raiders, and a little bit scary for small children (I  know I was 8 when I first saw it remember).  But there are some memorable  scenes involving:<br />Snake Surprise<br />Eyeball Soup<br />Chilled Monkey  Brains<br />Heart Surgery Without Anisthetic!<br />And an awesome scene of  mine kart racing.<br />This movie made at least one 8 year old boy want to  grow up and be Indiana Jones (I'm sure there are many more who aspired for  the job).  This is a great adventure movie that is perfect for a rainy day  with nothing to do.  For fans of all movies above the age of 10 this is one  for you.  But whatever happened to the original PG-13 rating?
6305776369|3.0|Molly Shannon is great. I do however feel, this being Saturday night live stuff, should be cut down to an hour and just be put down on T.V. Unfortuenly, we have to stick up another twenty minutes, so now it is a  movie. Okay, some funny jokes but overall a whiny script just begging for  attention.
6305052158|1.0|Unfortunately I did not have a chance to check out other customer comments concerning this DVD. So, for those who do check first ....be WARNED. This is the worst DVD I have experienced to date. The quality is similar to an  EP recorded video tape. The sound is terrible, and to be honest I had to  shut my unit off after enduring only the first 5 minutes of the movie. Too  bad, for the original VistaVision , Technicolor print was a gem when I ran  it in the theatre. I'm disappointed in Amazon, for allowing such a slimy  Company to sell their obvious duped product, on their web site. I have  learned my lesson, and will not buy another (BARGAIN DVD) from an unknown  company.
B00004S6GL|4.0|I believe that people who have been a fan of Elliott Smith's music for years and years are going to have a harder time accepting this album for what it is than new fans will.  I've been listening to Elliott Smith for  years, and have always treasured his music for the rough, raw guitar,  voice, instruments.<br />XO was, as some have said, pushing it, but it grew on  me, and I have come to love it.  It can never have the same intimacy of  &quot;elliott smith&quot; and &quot;roman candle&quot; and  &quot;either/or,&quot; but it has something that was hovering between old  and new, as you would expect, maybe, for an indie musician just becoming  signed. <br />I got a promo copy of Figure 8 and listened to it for months,  waiting, waiting, waiting for it to seep in.  Figure 8, while being a  terrific album, is not what one might be expecting when picking up a new  Elliott Smith disc, and certainly requires an open mind, allowing him to  evolve from raw to polished, from East coast to West.<br />I worry that this  album, being publicized rather well on the Internet, will introdude Elliott  Smith to a whole group of people that won't neccessarily appreciate what  came before it, when they seek out other music by him.  I don't want to see  him embraced for his new disc, then scorned for his older, more raw,  personal music.<br />If you're new to Elliott smith, i suggest buying  either/or first, then working back, then forward.  If  you're an old hat at  this, tread lightly, and with an open mind.  Put all 5 discs in a cd  changer, hit random play, and let Figure 8 mix in, because it might have a  hard time doing it on it's own.
0385486804|5.0|This biography of Christopher McCandless by the author of Into Thin Air is bound to reach any outdoorsman.  Here was an intelligent and well to do person who abandoned the white collar future planned for him and found  absolute freedom in wandering the American Southwest.  From his  reincarnation as Alexander Supertramp to his ultimate end in the Alaskan  backcountry, McCandless' story spawns the nagging question of why?  Each  person will find their own answer in the pages and accounts of this man who  did what many of us would do much to: gain from the wilds the ultimate  freedom of life.
B0000028M7|5.0|I don't even want to know how many times I've listened to this album, all the way through, and then when it was over played it again.  This was the first I ever heard Alice in Chains (thanks to my cousin playing  &quot;Rooster&quot; for me) and I immediately put the album on my NEED TO  BUY list back in early 1994.  Being forbidden MTV by my parents and really  having no previous interest in radio this album sparked my love of music  into a virtual inferno!  This was the first cd I ever bought, and for  that alone I love it.  But all the songs are a powerful offspring of potent  lyrics and chillingly talented musicians.  Jerry Cantrell's playing is  surreal and Layne Staley's singing is startling enough to puncture the  soul.  The first song &quot;Them Bones&quot; is one of my favorites, highly  introspective.  The second, &quot;Dam That River&quot; is an excellent play  on words.  &quot;Rain When I Die&quot; is haunting enough to put on repeat  itself.  &quot;Down In A Hole&quot; is a sad, self-aware song that screams  for the memorization of its lyrics and pertinence when just a little bit  down.  &quot;Sickman&quot; took me awhile to like, (maybe 3 seconds as  opposed to the instantaneous reaction I had to the previous 4 songs) but is  now a staple of my music listening experience.  &quot;Rooster&quot; well,  this is what started it all for me.  I don't think I'll ever get sick of  listening to this song and I've even been known to tell people to shut the  hell up while it's playing on the radio.  &quot;Junk Head&quot; is  blatantly about drug use and about criticising things and people alike  without bothering to find out both sides.  &quot;Dirt&quot; the song for  which the album is named has a really crazy sound to it and is like a  mid-album spike into a harder tone.  &quot;God Smack&quot; is another song  that took me a while to get used to but which I now love.  The untitled  screams and shouts on the tenth track always seemed to me like a short  eavesdropping on the denizens of hell. &quot;Hate To Feel&quot; is a great  anti-depressant when you feel alone, because it's quite obvious that Layne  Staley has felt the futility of depression.  &quot;Angry Chair&quot; is  another dark song, presumably dealing with apathy.  Last, but not least, is  &quot;Would?&quot; which has had fans of Alice in Chains asking themselves  &quot;what the hell is this about?&quot; ever since it first got airtime on  the radio, but not without them latching onto it as a fan favorite.  Now of  course no music album is worth anything if it doesn't entertain, and  whether you receive any message from the lyrics or not Dirt will definitely  do that.  An essential album for any child of the 1990's from one of the  best bands to come on the scene during that decade.  One of, if not the  best band out of Seattle.  If you like this check out their other albums  &quot;Facelift&quot; (their first album), &quot;Sap&quot; (really short),  &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; (three-legged dog on  the album cover), and their &quot;Unplugged&quot; album.ping on the denizens of hell. &quot;Hate To Feel&quot; is a great  anti-depressant when you feel alone, because it's quite obvious that Layne  Staley has felt the futility of depression.  &quot;Angry Chair&quot; is  another dark song, presumably dealing with apathy.

0441172717|5.0|This is easily the most hardcore sci-fi book I have ever read.  I don't know what Herbert was smoking, but I wish I had some.  I feel sorry for all the people who saw the movie and figured the book was that bad.  Their loss.  The complexity and imaginative power that this book reveals is truly  amazing.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I just got this album last week and wished that I had it a lot sooner. True, her voice is still very limited, but it will get stronger with time, you'll see. Madonna's voice was the same way in the begining of her career.  Now listen to her voice! I think that the same thing will happen to  Jennifer. She is very talented and will release a ton of albums in her  lifetime! I love Could This Be Love, Talk About Us, Should've Never, and  Let's Get Loud.
B00000064G|5.0|I was watching the VW Cabrio commercial one lonely night and this song (pink moon) was playing on it. It gave me goose bumps! I dunnoo what actually happend in those 30 seconds...but it was like this song really  touched my soul. I bought the CD and its really awesome. I wish this genius  of a man was still alive so he could bless us all with his rythmic blues.
1572522089|5.0|After watching The Seven Samurai, I was enthralled by Kurosawa's incredible work, but I worried that I'd see his best already.  I never would have expected Ran to take my breath away, but that's what happened.   The film's dazzling colors against a stark landscape, the piercing music  against long interludes of silence and the dizzying plots that weave  together seamlessly and tragically very quickly hypnotized me.  Overall,  though, it was Tatsuya Nakadai's genius portrayal of the aged warlord  Hidetora that made this a masterpiece.  Here is a character whose very  expression and stance allows one to see the depths of his soul.  Brilliant.
B000002G30|4.0|While their 2nd albumn &quot;SUPER Judge&quot; was anything but, this third full length effort from Jersey's finest &quot;Devil's Advocates&quot; is a return to essence.  Gone are gratuitous drug references, and &quot;SATAN-SATAN-SATAN!&quot;-isms, in favor of expanded studio trickery,  and suprisingly personal lyrics, behind all the usual action figure  imagery.  Dare I call it a sign of maturity?  More like a reason to beleive  in this group's career longevity.  While this does make excellent ...  back ground music, it can also be enjoyed on many a fuzzy morning after.   Enjoy frequently and in good cheer!
0880389052|5.0|The mystery of the dark elves could not of been uncovered better by any other writer.  Props to whoever at TSR gave Salvatore the duty to give life to the dark denizens beneath the surface of Toril.  The intrigue and evil of the Drow society is brought to life by Salvatore in a manner that makes  fuedal Japan look like the Truman Show.  Also, the book brings to the  literary world one its greatest dramatic characters since Othello and the  Karamozov brothers...Drizzt.  Enough said.
B00003CX5A|5.0|I always was a big Tim Burton-fan, and Sleepy Hollow met all my expectations - and more. Partly a who-dunnit, partly a horror movie, partly even a love story, but to me just as much a comedy, because it always keeps  its self-irony - the hero is not quite a hero, the villain maybe not quite  a real villain. As usual for Tim Burton movies, it comes complete with  supreme cinematography, unique mood and a nice soundtrack. All in all, the  best film I have seen this season, and the one I can least wait to own.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|When I got this CD, I listened to it and was slightly hesitant to returning it.  But after really listening to it, I grew to love all of the songs.  In fact, this is my favorite CD now!  The song &quot;Crash and  Burn&quot; is beautiful.  I love the part where he sings &quot;When you  feel alone and the world has turned it's back on you...&quot;  and  &quot;When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take  anymore....&quot;  &quot;Two Beds and a Coffee Machine&quot; is another one  of my favorites.  I just the love the background music to it.  It makes me  feel so calm.  Then there's &quot;The Lover After Me&quot; and &quot;I Knew  I Loved You&quot;, which is almost everyone's favorite slow song.   &quot;Affirmation&quot; is a great song about self-respect.  And &quot;You  Can Still Be Free&quot; is beautiful.  &quot;Cool breeze and autumn leaves  slow the motion daylight...feel the presence all around, the tortured  soul....but you can still be free...if time will set you free...&quot; Do  you think that the Backstreet Boys or Nsync (Those bands are great, though)  could write and sing things like that?  &quot;Hold Me&quot; really cool,  too.  I like the part where he sings &quot;Hey, if we can't find a way out  of these problems, then maybe we don't need this...&quot;  Pretty much what  I'm saying is that you should get this CD.  It's really beautiful and  Darren and Daniel are very talented.  If you like this CD, you should also  get their first album which contains &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot;  (which is the best song EVER!).
B00000JCOV|4.0|I was warned about these guys months ago.  Described as an over-the-top 9 peice, dressed like surrealist bank robbers, from Iowa no less, I was really intrigued.  But in an age of marketing over material, I was very  leary.  In an age where metal has come to mean Frat Boys in Baggy Pants  trying to rap over half assed riffs and pro-wrestling posturing, I took my  time checking them out.  Boy was I dumb!  That was 6 months I coulda had  this roaring out of my system, and making anything in the general viscinity  with functional ears, VERY UNHAPPY!  Never mind the matching jump suits,  and crazy masks, even and especially without these things, this sucker flat  out Rocks!  While the djing and sampling help keep things fresh, they are  used sparingly, for atomesphere.  While the singer uses the standard  Death-Metal growl, you can actually understand him, and his lyrics, which  are brutally direct and confrontational to everything in pummeling  distance.  And 3 drummers?  It explains why they can cop Drum 'n Bass  rythmns, and push them all the way out of the freakin' envelope.  It's so  wonderfully powerful that I find their ballads to be unwelcome filler, and  thus only four stars.  Next time Kill 'Em All, fellas.  It's what Colonel  Kurtz would want you to do.....
B000001ELB|5.0|This is the KISS greatest hits album! If you buy this, there is no need to buy any of there CD's up until 1979. Gene takes care of songs like &quot;God of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot;. Paul does  &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Strutter&quot;, and Gene and Paul  do a great job on &quot;Rock and Roll All Night&quot;! They also do good on  editing out some of Ace Frehley's bad songs, the lyrics are good though. No  offence Ace, but you are not the greatest singer in the world (but a darn  good guitar player though). &quot;KISS Thrashes, Smashes and Hits&quot;  takes care of the rest of their greatest songs from 1979 to 1987 when Eric  Carr replaced Peter Criss as drummer and Vinnie Vincent replaced Ace as  lead guitarist.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Ghostbusters could almost be what DVD was designed for: a film jammed with special effects which benefits no end from the crystal clear picture DVD offers, combined with a whole host of fun extras, including deleted scenes  and endless amounts of trivia for film buffs. The movie itself is good  family entertainment, and has dated less than you might expect. Having said  that, whilst I was initially delighted by this disc, and had a great time  playing with all the bonus features, I found the film better than when I  watched it years ago on VHS. Great for kids also, but really this movie is  an all time classic.
B000002IFP|5.0|For the life of me, I can't understand why &quot;A New Flame&quot; was so widely panned; call me crazy, but this was my favorite Simply Red album. Where &quot;Men and Women&quot; was somewhat uneven and &quot;Life&quot;  gets a bit dull by the end, &quot;A New Flame&quot; really seemed to flow  as an album without ever losing steam. How could critics ignore the sheer  beauty of &quot;You've Got It&quot; or &quot;Again&quot;? What's wrong with  &quot;Turn it Up&quot;? The one false note (in my opinion) was &quot;If You  Don't Know Me By Now&quot;; there was no reason to re-make the original,  and Mick Hucknall made no particular improvements to it. But on the  strength of &quot;You've Got It&quot; alone, this album deserved much more  respect than it got.
0140067477|5.0|I found this to be a wonderful book that uses delightful stories to express views on life and the current world.  This book gives you the feeling that there is hope, and that we are all capable of being wise.  It  is also pleasant to read and very positive.  I think that everybody  everywhere should read this book.
0790734427|5.0|This is the best Batman movie of all 4 of them! They all went downhill from here. Micheal Keaton is the best Batman of all, he could kick Val Kilmer and George Clooney's butt any day of the week. The Joker is Batman's  best enemy, and Jack Nicholson does a great job of this monstrous villian  some call &quot;The Joker&quot;. HA, HA, HA, HA. The movie is dark and  spooky (well, it has to be seeing how Tim Burton directed it). Danny  Elfman's music is awsome too. The Batmobile and Batwing are th best design  of  of the series, compared crappy ones that come after it. These models  were better than any other computer animated vehicals that come afterwards.  No ice-skate boots, no &quot;Power Ranger&quot; moves, and best of all...  no Robin. Don't bother with any of the other 3 films, it's all in this one!
B00000JGHM|5.0|What a superb action film with a great story line. &quot;Heat&quot; got its name because this is how the police are referred to in the movie. A classic quote for the movie is where Robert De Nero(criminal) says to Al  Pacino (cop) &quot;Don't have anything you can't walk away from in 5  seconds flat when the heat are around the corner&quot; Don't be put off by  the films length thinking you can't possibly sit watching a film of that  length. Heat is directed my Michael Mann who also directed the Oscar film  &quot;The Insider&quot;. The line up of actors Val Kilmer, Al Pacino,  Robert De Nero need no introduction they are all superb in the movie. I  watched this movie for the first time on DVD and if anything you want it to  go on longer seeing Denero &quot;outwhit&quot; Pacino, missing each time  when trying to catch him, wondering whether he will catch him or will he  get away? The DVD itself for the money is well worth it you have a full  length exciting, action packed, great acting film for a very reasonable  price! The Dolby 5.1 is awesome, the beginning scene dives straight into  the action which gives you the pleasure of listening and watching the  quality of the DVD. Don't let the lack of extras put you off a great  purchase of the DVD, the film is worth the money on its own.
B000002IFN|3.0|&quot;Men and Women&quot; is an uneven effort, with Mick Hucknall again making some uninspired choices in cover tunes.  However, &quot;The Right Thing&quot;, &quot;Infidelity&quot;, &quot;Suffer&quot;, and the gorgeous  &quot;Maybe Someday&quot; make this worth the price of the album. Reviewers  often seem to knock Hucknall for what they consider to be failed attempts  at &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot;, but I disagree; he's got it knocked. Not  their best effort by far, but some truly shining moments.
6305499365|5.0|I was on the floor I was laughing so hard.  You can relate it to your work as well with the jams with paper to dorky co workers and annoying boses
6300181286|5.0|The only word for this film is &quot;awsome&quot;. This movie ranks only second to &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922). Boris Karloff does an outstanding job as the monster! The scene where the monster and his creator are facing  off behind the spinning terbine is one of the most eeriest scenes in all of  film. I mean how would you like to be stuck in a small, dark, wooden,  windmill tower, with Frankenstein's monster trying to kill you? Much better  than any of the other Frankenstein movies! I mean it. The next best one  would be &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;.
079073639X|5.0|I really enjoyed this film, its s science fiction mystery type movie. I would recommend you watching the trailer before the movie as it clears up some confusion. The trailer is located on the DVD. It is similar to event  horizon if you have seen that. I thought the idea behind the movie was  really good along with the superb effects. The line up of actors says it  all Stone, Hoffman, Jackson! You know you're in for a great movie when you  have a cast like that! The DVD has a few interesting features, the behind  the scenes take a look at the special effects, how they created them etc.  Even if you have seen the film previously then you must now experience it  on DVD for the superb sound, picture quality and amazing film. Overall  terrific value and money well spent.
B000002HO3|4.0|Sure, MOST of the band's hits are here, but where the hell are &quot;Come to My Aid&quot; and &quot;Infidelity&quot;? Other than those glaring omissions, this greatest-hits package comes highly recommended. &quot;How  Could I Fall&quot;, though not a chart hit, would have made a better  inclusion than &quot;For Your Babies&quot; and &quot;Mirror&quot;, but  since the gorgeous &quot;You've Got It&quot; and, of course &quot;Holding  Back the Years&quot; fulfill the perfect ballad quotient here, why quibble?  Worth owning for those unwilling to buy any other Simply Red albums.
0811806405|5.0|I am a guitarmaker based in Canada.  I bought this book after my first attempt at making a guitar, and I wish I'd known about before I ever started building!  Not only is it encyclopedic in content, but it is very  interesting and readable.  Even if you never plan to construct an  instrument, this book will quickly turn you into a guitar expert. It is a  great read, cover-to-cover, with lots of historical information that helped  me more fully understand why certain things are done certain ways.   I must  admit, however, that the neck attachment method described in the book is  quite complex, and may prove to be somewhat intimidating for the amateur  woodworker.  Check Mr. Cumpiano's website for a much easier method of neck  attachment, as well as for other updates and clarification of any obscure  points in the book.   My only complaint about this book is that it refuses  to lay open and flat on my workbench!
B000003S0P|5.0|Red was the very first KC album I bought. Now, I have the entire studio collection. I was deeply impressed by the whole album. Starless is the most precious stone in this jewel box.<br />I still cannot understand why the  production quality of LTIA and SBB is so inferior in comparison to the  crispiness of RED.<br />Thank you Messrs. Fripp, Wetton and Bruford.
B00000DFRS|4.0|....makes for a good listening. Whitney is trying to update her sound and she tries hard. Invitng collaborators from all types of R&amp;B and pop music, she tries hard to be hip. And it works. The first 3 tracks are the  strongest points on the album. They're top R&amp;b tracks. &quot;When You  Believe&quot; is the typical diva ballad which doesn't miss but doesn't  quite hit either. Then, it picks up with &quot;I Told You That&quot; and  other tracks. Yet, the second half of the album is a mere disappointment.  The ballads aren't touching, they merely frustrate and irritate the  listener who would rather replay the eariler tracks. The only ballad which  really hits is &quot;I Learned From the Best&quot;, a powerful anthem of  &quot;now-I-know&quot; songs. What saves the album from a banal ending is a  hidden track contributed by Lauryn Hill. Smooth and sensuous, its a  wonderful end to the album. That said, buy the album if you're comfortable  with both R&amp;B and ballads. If you're not, you're better off buying the  singles.
6305750750|5.0|I think that this was a great video that explained who Anakin Skywalker was and how he met Obi-Wan Kenobi. Also you learn a lot more about the force and what the Old Rebublic was like with the Jedi council and the  Senate. I think this movie had excellent computer graphics and is a much  needed movie to explain the original trilogy.
B00000IGGA|5.0|...when I go just about everywhere. I bought &quot;Mule Variations&quot; while riding up to St. Louis, and take it with me any time I know I'm going to go anywhere far away. Let me tell you, &quot;Mule Variations&quot; is  best listened to while travelling long distances. It's on the road that you  can truly appreciate the work of Tom Waits (and his co-writer and wife,  Kathleen Brennan).<br />This was my first exposure to the music of the very  talented Mr. Waits. I had never listened to any of his stuff before April  '99 simply because...well, I had never really heard of the guy before, at  least through music. However, I'm very glad I got into his stuff...he's  influenced me in so many different ways it's scary.<br />A mule is the  offspring of a male ass and female horse, right? That's the exact way I'd  describe this CD. It's a mixture of so many different genres of music that  you're listening to at least 2 different genres in each song. From the  loud, booming horns, guitars, and percussion samples of the opening track,  &quot;Big in Japan&quot; to the blues of &quot;Get Behind the Mule&quot; to  the creepy spoken word and sound effects of &quot;What's He Building?&quot;  this CD has songs that could fit just about everyone.<br />Some other  extremely good tracks from &quot;Mule&quot; are the slow rock song,  &quot;Hold On,&quot; which Rod Stewart has already bought the cover rights  too. &quot;House Where Nobody Lives&quot; is a depressing tale of a  deserted house which holds no love. &quot;Cold Water&quot; is a bluesy  singalong told through the eyes of a railroad bum, with an extremely cool  guitar solo from Marc Ribot. &quot;Picture in a Frame&quot; is a sweet  piano heavy love song, and &quot;Chocolate Jesus&quot; is a hilarious (if  somewhat blasphemous) song about buying a candy coated model of the savior.  The raucious, country-fied goodness of &quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog&quot;  will probably make you extremely hungry, and &quot;Take It With Me&quot; is  a sweet look at the end of life and memories taken along.<br />The CD's true  gem, though, is &quot;Come On Up to the House,&quot; a lovely piano and  harmonica tinged gospel singalong which tells us: &quot;All your cryin'  don't do no good, you gotta come on up to the house.&quot; It's a  wonderfully optimistic song in an album of doubters, and the one you'll  probably be playing to cheer you up when you're feeling down.<br />This album  won this year's Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album, although it's much  more than that. Tom Waits has a huge fan base, yet is extremely unknown  among the youth of today, who are off listening to their Backstreet Boys  and Britney Spears and KoRn and Limp Bizkit (or any variations thereof).  It's sad to know that these talentless little moneygrubbers who don't write  a lyric of their own are getting more respect and credit than this  extremely talented and influential storyteller.<br />&quot;Mule  Variations&quot; is a great introduction to Mr. Waits' music, and contains  most of the musical styles he's used in his near 20 year career. So, if you  or anyone you know would like to start listening to something more quality  than Top 40 radio, pick up this album and share it with your friends.
B000006I14|4.0|The earliest version of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is a wonder to see. It is silent and somewhat broadly acted, but the sets and soundtrack are wonderful, which seems to make the film more melodramatic (and more like a  work of art than a film). It is hardly scary, and sometimes humorous. But  it is an undeniable classic that demands serious attention. Nosferatu was  certainly scary in its time, and not the least by Max Shreck's bald head  and bat ears. I do not feel it right to have physical appearances reveal  someone's true character, but it actually helps the film!<br />One problem to  watch out for is that is almost always daylight. Dracula sleeps during the  day, and it is better to be familiar with the story before seeing this  film, because it will save much if not all confusion in that area.<br />All in  all, this Dracula film is almost completely unlike any other Draculas and  is highly recommended for classic film buffs.
0380799006|5.0|I mean it. It really helped me do a better job with our three kids and also with my job. What's great are that it is really a few simple rules and some good exercises. A quick read and informative
B00003W8NM|5.0|I didn't see this movie in the theaters because it had gotten very mixed reviews from the so-called professional movie reviewers.  But, when it hit the local vidoe store, I thought I would give it a try.  WOW, what a kick  in the teeth, interesting, and fast moving journey into one man's mind.  The path this movie takes is fantastic.<br />Norton and Pitt are perfectly  cast, and supported by a crew of fight club members that make for a  well-acted show.  Meatloaf, Ed Gil, Jared Leto, et. al. are great in  support as the members/followers of the leads.  Helena Bonham Carter has  the only real female role in this film and is perfectly cast.  But as much  as the acting, this movie is made by the story.  Unconventional, with a  great twist at the end, the whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  As  with many great movies, it is hard to classify the genre (action, comedy,  drama), as there is a sampling of all in this film.  In the end, I would  just classify this as a great film.<br />Much was made of the violence of this  movie when it first hit the theaters.  Those critics overstated the case.  There is blood and violence in the movie, but it is not excessive and it  serves the plot well.<br />If you missed this in the theater, see it now.  If  you saw it once, see it again.  I will.
B000002U3P|5.0|I love the music, It has a beat and I can understand the words, Now I have to see the Movie.
B00000K19E|3.0|Well-done; but not nearly as good as most people think it is.  The whole virtual reality/reality angle isn't particularly new, or even presented freshly, but since most people aren't acquainted with science fiction that  well they're impressed. The acting is horrible; I wouldn't expect much from  the male lead, but even the other actors, some of who have showed talent  elsewhere give wooden performances.  The movie is put together well, and  while the art direction is the usual Ridley Scott/H.R. Giger ripoff it's at  least done professionally.  The action scenes are well-choreographed,  though I've seen a lot better. All in all a decent movie.
1559408758|5.0|Can a movie get eleven stars?  Unfortunately, no.  But, This Is Spinal Tap comes close.  Rob Reiner, along with the men of Tap, have created a masterpiece of rock and roll humor.  Incredibly funny, the story of the  Smell the Glove tour by the aging rock band Spinal Tap pokes fun at all the  prior &quot;rockumentaries&quot;, while providing some suprisingly decent  music too.<br />Interviews with the band, live concert footage, flashbacks  and behind the scenes of a working rock band, this movie has it all, and it  is all funny.  This is a brilliantly witty take on those way too serious  rock bands who think that we really need to know all about them.<br />I  hesitate to call the movie well written, as I understand there was quite a  bit of ad-libbing going on. Nonetheless, the actors do a great job of bring  to life the characters that make up one of the loudest rock bands of all  time.  Supporting roles by Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Fran Drecsher, Doug  Squires and Paul Shaffer add even more to this extraoridinarily funny  cast.<br />Plus, from &quot;Come on, Mime is money&quot; to &quot;This one  goes to eleven&quot;, this movie is full of great movie lines that you will  be quoting to friends for years to come.<br />A previous reviewing indicates  this will soon be rereleased.  Not a minute too soon.  If I borrow my  friends copy one more time, I may suffer the fate of any of the number of  Tap drummers.<br />A classic and a must for any DVD collection.  When it  comes back, get your copy fast.  You won't be sorry.
0671578642|5.0|I thought that this novel was fantastic, it has an interesting military and even scientific depth that is often lacking in most sci-fi works.  The story is rich and strong giving many points of views, and a great flow that keeps the reader constantly interested in this page-turner.  I thought that  the plot was well made and was greatly structured, I couldn't wait to see  what was goiung to happen next.  I greatly reccomend this book to everyone  especially to those who like military action novels with more depth than  action.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|My sister and I love Jennifer Lopez as an Actress and a Singer. I thought the C.D was Exellent. I am a Jazz dancer at M.J Dance Studio, and my Jazz teacher has taught us a dance to &quot; Let's make it Loud&quot;. It is a  very cool dance.
044022425X|1.0|It is very difficult to read one book without reading them all, and that is torture. Claire is too smart to be believable, therefore she becomes an irritating know it all.  I had no interest in the North Carolina frontier  and will NOT read another.  I'm through with Gabaldon.  The books are too  long, for one thing.  A better writer could pull it off.  She can't.  I  hope there will be no more of Claire, Jamie, and Brianna.  I've read enough  to last several lifetimes.
B000000993|5.0|As someone lucky enough to have seen Tool twice in concert so far, I've got to issue an enthusiastic thumbs up to &quot;Undertow&quot;.<br />Unlike Ænima, Undertow is much more of a straight ahead rock record, but with that  Toolish twist, giving it that uniqueness that's missing from so many of the  other bands of today.<br />Included are two classics, &quot;Prison Sex&quot;  (with that amazing intro that is sure to provide shivers up the spine) and  &quot;Sober&quot;. But there's more, particularly &quot;Bottom&quot; with  an excellent spoken word part by Henry Rollins. &quot;Swamp Song,  &quot;Undertow&quot;, and &quot;Flood&quot; are also great.<br />The album art  itself is worth the price of the CD. Highly original and something only the  guys in Tool could come up with. Be sure to snap out the CD tray to see  what's underneath.<br />Great album, great band, this one will stay in your CD  player for a long time. It has mine.
B00004RIV4|4.0|I missed them two previous albums. But that was just warm up. On this album you'll here mature original sound with groundbreaking harmonies and rhytms. And even if you find some PORTISHEAD and BASEMENT JAXX quotes,  you'll be happy this music. Exellent 18 songs effort! Best tracks: Pure  Pleasure Seeker, Remain The Same, Time Is Now, Mother, Sing It Back. Enjoy  it!
B000002KBU|5.0|From quite sometime, I have been hearing so much about this name and how many a contemporary female singer would credit her name as one of their greatest influences and indeed, upon hearing this album in it's great  wholeness, I finally have discovered the reason. Blue was actually my first  &quot;awakening&quot; on a Joni Mitchell album and I'm sure glad I listened  to this CD. It will be very unfair not to digest all the songs here because  this album seems to have been meant for continuous play. I also have heard  it being an overrated album and rightfully so, in the sense that five stars  isn't just enuff for this great masterpiece. <br />Tho' I have listened to  some artists try to imitate her vocal style, there definitely is only one  Joni Mitchell and Blue IS her definitive album. Stock copies of it, just in  case you wear out on one...
1558807381|5.0|This was a highly unusual film in the sense that it was not marketed for young children despite its strong fairy tale theme. Yet, with a fearsome character like Darkness, one can see why young children would have  nightmares. Fortunatley I was a teen when this movie was released; I truly  cherish this film for it's rich effects, costumes, and brilliant sets and  backgrounds (not at all a slouch for a 1986 release pre-dating computer  graphics effects). It is also hard to believe that in that very same year  of 1986 Tom Cruise would also star in his trademark blockbuster film Top  Gun. Mia Sara is also a fine actress in her own artistic right; She was not  at all melodramatic nor was she cardboard either ! The amazing  transformation both physically and vocally for Tim Curry's Darkness is  still one of the most mesmerizing actor-costume appearances in film  history!<br />Yes, I too, am waiting for the letterboxed dvd version !
B00000IPAX|5.0|this cd is probably one of the best I've heard. all my friends and I love this band.  We all listen to it all the time.
6303965415|4.0|I own this movie, and I highly recommend it.   Next to the 1996 version of Pride and Prejudice it  is my favorite movie pertaining to Jane Austen's stories.  It is true to the story line.   The acting is superb.   You won't  regret purchasing it.
B000002UB3|5.0|One of the best albums ever made. My favorite tracks are &quot;I Want You&quot; (Lennon's slow burn) and all of side 2. That's from &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; to &quot;The End&quot;. Rock or Pop, whatever you call  it this is the mountaintop.
6303921248|5.0|This version of Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; far outshines them all.  The direction, acting , and production are wonderful.  Colin Firth lends a quality of emotion in his portrayal of Darcy that is  not seen very often.  He makes Darcy human and not just a stilted, pompous  piece  of cardboard.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys  the highest in viewing quality.
B000000OMB|4.0|I really only like the first 3 songs here but what incredible songs they are!  &quot;Supergroups&quot; usually are bands of big name stars trying to outdo each other.Not in this band,no way.They could've really gone into  overblown territory but everything stays in check.A solid piece of music  start to finish.
6302719631|2.0|I purchased this movie, unfortunately! I did not watch it all the way through, however! What I did see of the movie did not satisfy me. The music was highly irritating and the fantasy scenes in between the telling of the  story needed to be obliterated!   I was extemely bored by the whole affair  to say the least!   The acting was not wholly bad, but the movie should  have been approached from a totally different angle and therein lies the  disappointment.  I strongly suggest that you waste neither your time or  your money on this movie.  I truly wish I had not.
B000002UAX|4.0|I dock this one star because of all the filler,the obvious and otherwise. But holy smokes the good stuff is absolutely incredible!  &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;,&quot;Glass Onion&quot;,&quot;While My Guitar...&quot; and  everything else (I don't care for Ob-la-di Ob-la-da,I'll take Rocky Raccoon  over that anyday) just blows you away.
B00004SVID|5.0|When I bought this CD, I tried not to get excited.  The last &quot;live&quot; album I bought (Guns n Roses- The Live Era) was terrible.  It still rated 3 stars due to the raw material.  But the production, crowd  noise, and material selection was horrible.  Axl needs to leave the Moog  and get to the mixing board.  So when this CD came in the  US mail,  my  enthusiasm was somewhat tempered.  Then I put disc one in the CD player.   WOW!  Bombastic!  Over the top!  Marvelous!  Orgasmic!  If any live rock  recording is any better than this one, I don't want to know about it.  I  couldn't handle it.  Buy this record.
B000002KHH|5.0|Was &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; supposed to be a breather,an experiment,or was it already on the tape when they started recording the album and decided to leave it there? I love this album but track#3 gets the skip  button every time.
B000002J1M|5.0|This albums isn't better than Selling England by the Pound, but Supper's ready is great, and whole album is very good. If you don't know old Genesis, this album might be good start.
B000002UAR|5.0|In ways. The production is obviously sparer which is good because it reveals The Beatles were capable of beautiful music without layered effects.&quot;Taxman&quot; is a funny rocker with a great solo.BUY IT BUY  IT BUY IT!
B000002H97|5.0|You have to buy this cd! Every song is awesome. Enter Sandman- Can you say AWESOME Sad but true- One of Metallica's best songs ever! Holier than thou- Strong, powerful lyrics Unforgiven- Wonderful ballad Wherever I may  roam-another 1 of the best songs ever Don't tread on me-Great song No need  to say anymore buy this cd. you won't regret it. First time I turned this  on I was blown away Worth every pennie-BUY IT!
B000002KDO|5.0|&quot;Children of the Grave&quot; is just one reason to love Sabbath.The songwriting improved greatly and the band cranks 'em out and leaves you wanting more.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Alas, what is there left to say about this classic album which has not already been expressed a thousand times before?  Twenty years later they are still releasing new remastered versions of &quot;Tapestry&quot;...and  over 11 million persons have already purchased a copy of this definitive  work...can they all be wrong? No.  Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot;  song-for-song and as a whole, whether one listens to it beginning to end or  pushes the &quot;shuffle&quot; button on his CD player, is a major hit with  success written all over it.<br />King's uncomplicated phrasing, confident  piano style and soft arrangements on this work were a major influence on  the singer-songwriter movement of the seventies.  It is impossible to list  a favorite here...the heartfelt directness found in &quot;So Far Away&quot;  and &quot;Home Again&quot;...the spiritual yearning in &quot;Way Over  Yonder&quot;...the joyousness of &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot; moving  into the upbeat &quot;Where You Lead&quot;...and the mystical, masterful  storytelling found in the title track itself...this is an album of major  songs.  In fact, the tunes here have been recorded so often by King  herself, played so many times on the air and covered so frequently by other  artists that listening back to &quot;Tapestry&quot; nowadays is like  turning on 45 minutes of good, random FM radio...everything is familiar!   <br />The new edition of &quot;Tapestry&quot; includes an interesting and  upbeat missing bonus track.  In &quot;Out in the Cold&quot;, Carole King  surprisingly is the &quot;bad girl&quot; who has been stepping out on her  man (a bit out of character for her during those songwriting days.  It is  understandable why they decided to omit it originally from the album.)   Concluding the set is a live bonus track of &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;  recorded a few years later during her &quot;Fantasy&quot; era.  Both  additional tracks are pleasant addendums to an already remarkable work.   <br />As phenominal as &quot;Tapestry&quot; is...my favorite albums by King  follow in the few years after the release of &quot;Tapestry&quot;.  Check  out &quot;Rhymes &amp; Reasons&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot; and  &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; to hear some of her greatest and most prolific  work.
B000002KIC|5.0|You really should see the movie first and if you like it (why wouldn't you) then get the album. I don't usually endorse soundtracks but you can't lose with this one.All the performances are excellent. A truly historical  event.
B000023X9W|4.0|Another Neil Young record. Let me tell you how happy I am he has gone acoustic again.  His current electric projects have become (to me) tiresome and predictable. On Silver and Gold, Young picks up his ole 6 string and  sings with his real heart and emotions on several of his greatest songs in  the last 10 years. After the disappointing CSN&amp;Y record who would've  thought that Young still REALLY had it in him.  The great tracks are few  &quot;Red Sun&quot; &quot;Razor Love&quot; but the bad tracks are not to be  heard of.  Besides my new Minster Hill and Elliott Smith records, Neil has  given me one of the best acousticly melodic records of the year. Get it.
B000002UAU|5.0|for better or worse. Probably responsible for as many bad imitations as good ones. Parts of side 2 don't seem to be as important to the overall feel of the record. The songs? Taken individually they are mini  symphonies.Except for &quot;Within You Without You&quot;. It just doesn't  fit in. The greatest album of all time? Probably not.Worth owning?  Definitely.
0380973464|5.0|Throughout this 900+ page masterpience, Stephenson challenges the reader's mind, and their ability to sleep! I often found myself so enthralled by the problems (mathmatical and logistical) faced by the protagonist, that I  would often stay awake for hours in bed, trying to work them out. It was a  great book, well worth the read, and I can't wait for his next.
B00000DQT7|5.0|Better.A very beautiful album that you will sing along with no matter how many times you hear it.Every song a masterpiece.Even the seemingly slight &quot;King Harvest&quot; is a gem,and is now my personal favorite on this  record. A solid album,another candidate for best album of the 60s.
B000009QPE|5.0|Out of hundreds of CDs that i own and had ever listened to, and being a heavy metal fan, this is easily unquestionably THE BEST CD ever. Thrash metal is known as this CD. You cannot be a thrash metal fan without loving  this album. The power and speed of this album is unmatched to this day.  This CD is without a flaw. Their performance is amazing and perfect. If you  are thinking about getting into heavy metal, this album is a must.
B000002UDB|4.0|The good stuff starts at track 6 but the first 5 are alright. &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; will take you there.Beautiful and scary at the same time.
0808520695|5.0|&quot;CAT'S CRADDLE,&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut is not an exception of his awesome work in every book of his. For his funny imagination gave life to the story of a Christian named John, who wants to write a factual book about what the family of one of the fathers of the atomic bomb had done on  the day that the a-bomb was dropped. Though, he has to travel to the  Republic of San Lorenzo in order to finish interviewing the family members.  And in San Lorenzo several events take place causing John to change from  his religion to Bokonist. If you thought that there won't be anything  weirder than &quot;SLAPSTICK OR LONESOME NO MORE.&quot; Well, let me tell  you that you've to read this book to really know what you're saying.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Do I recommend it? Of course! I just want to say that being used to the mono mix for so long I wanted to hear it in stereo. But honestly the stereo mix doesn't do anything for me. Naturally this is an important piece of any  music collection.
B0000041DF|2.0|I am usually Argerich's biggest fan.  I simply don't care for this recording of the Rachmaninoff.  Maybe, it is because I've also performed the piece with orchestra over a ten year period, and so have my own view of  the piece.  In my opinion her tempos, particularly in the last movement  sound like a pianist who is not thoroughly in control of the notes.  It is  almost as if she is trying to cover up an inferior technic, as an  undeveloped student usually does, by playing fast. I know that this is most  definitely NOT the case.  But, why does she virtually ruin the piece by  turning it into a Czerny Etude?  Listen to the early Horowitz recordings  for an artist in TOTAL command of the notes...  My view seems to be  verified by other pianists I personally know, but it is not apparently  upheld by public opinion.  One wonders what Rachmaninoff would have  thought, with his much &quot;cooler&quot; approach.  He probably would have  found this performance &quot;hysterical.&quot;  Let's remember that he  didn't intend it as an empty finger exercise.
B000002UAO|5.0|With Rubber Soul the Lads matured into the world of folk rock. An album of quiet masterpieces. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is the best example of where rock music would soon be.
0783113161|4.0|This movie was ok. It was like Air Force One without a plot. It is the stupidest movie ive ever seen, but if you are at home all alone one Friday night, this movie'll keep you entertained all night. Notes to Parents: If  you are letting your kids see this, there are rape scenes, murder scenes,  and mild nudity. I would have rated this move R but, who cares
B000002HH2|5.0|A soundtrack to a dream/nightmare.Join her,won't you?
B00000JGOH|5.0|When I first watched this film I was slightly disappointed. It just didn't seem what it had been cracked up to be. All the supposedly clever allusions were soo obvious and usually repeated several times (Marlowe, Webster! ).  And of course Ms Paltrow isn't a Renaissance woman, good as she may be as a  spoiled upper class American.     After watching it several times (with my  pupils at school, I must admit) I have come to recognize that this film is  a work of genius - or almost. For a start, it effortlessly manages to  contain all the typical elements of a Shakespeare play: crossdressing,  swordfights, bawdiness, double-entendre, suspense, wordplay etc.etc. Even a  dog and a shipwreck, for that matter. All those elemets are composed in an  almost musical way which stands the test of watching it again and again. So  it's well worth buying it - you'll want to watch it more than  once!<br />Still, my qualms about Ms Paltrow persist. In contrast to the rest  of the brilliant cast she seems to be incapable of irony. Well, I guess  that's what you get for picking a Yank actress for the job...
B00000DQSF|5.0|This album is best known for &quot;The Weight&quot;. The organ intro to &quot;Chest Fever&quot; will floor you.Each song is like a little story.I don't have a life-changing-related story about this album, I just want to  say that among everything else that came out of 1968,this is great music. I  absolutely recommend.
B00003CWL5|5.0|The beginning of this movie scared me a bit: Wasn't this just a heap of clichés thrown together? Would we have to watch two hours of a middle aged man's pining for a teenage girl?     Then all of a sudden the clichés came  alive and turned out to be real characters. Maybe this came about only  because one of them chose to finally say what he thought and do what he  felt like. It is quite surprising to see that a &quot;loser&quot; is no  longer a loser once he stops trying to be what he is not.<br />   It is  tremendous fun watching how the American fear of being a &quot;loser&quot;  or a &quot;deviant&quot; person is being exploded from within. Refusing to  go on with the common hipocrisy seems to be a thoroughly exhilarating  experience. Maybe we should all trade our offices for hamburger joints? <br />    It will make you laugh, it will make you think, it will make you (almost)  cry.
B000002UB6|4.0|Phil Spector ruined it with his nonsense.Did they really want it to be overblown?
B000003RCY|5.0|All I can really say about this CD is WOW!   This is the kind of music that makes your blood run a little faster.  Just when the music world was starting to seem boring and monotonous, along comes Rammstein to set things  on fire (literally).  All of the songs are sung in German, but the music  and the sound of the lead singer's voice are so powerful and infectious  that it doesn't even matter that you have no idea what he's saying.  You'll  find yourself trying to sing along even though it's not your language. Put  simply, THIS IS A MUST-HAVE CD!
B000002JSH|4.0|Besides the obvious &quot;Shooting Star&quot; and &quot;Feel Like Making Love&quot; (Best marriage of music and lyrics EVER) there is another gem on this cd called &quot;Call On Me&quot; that strays slightly from the Bad Co  formula.I must recommend this for all rock fans.
B0000039LE|5.0|Being a huge horror fan, I naturally watched this movie as soon as I was old enough to be allowed to.  It scared the hell out of me then and now that I'm 20 it still gives me a good creep-out.  Ten times better than  other lunatic-stalker-killer flicks because of the extremely high suspense  level and lack of graphic bloody gore.  Don't get me wrong--there are  murders aplenty in this movie, they just don't tastelessly splash the walls  with fake &quot;blood&quot;.  Don't watch it alone or in the dark...
B000002KB8|5.0|The opening shot.Nobody was prepared for the end of flower power,thank goodness Sabbath came along when they did.Taking the darkness of the Doors farther than even they imagined.The songwriting could've been a little  stronger but &quot;The Wizard&quot; and the title track and  &quot;N.I.B.&quot; are fully realized masterpieces on an otherwise raw  album.The remastering is outstanding. If you don't have this,Ozzy will hunt  you down.
630018160X|3.0|Sweet Charity is too ambitious a musical for a debut on the silver screen. At its best it should be regarded as the first steps of Fosse as a director, just a work whose shortcomings would improve in the future. Once  the thrill of the first viewing from the viewpoint of a musical movie fan  wears away, anyone who appreciates good cinema making notices its overblown  production,long-winded and somewhat contrived action, some good acting here  and there, too many camera and editing tricks (typical of the 60s), great  score and unforgetable musical numbers, which unfortunately cannot take the  cake. Pity! Nevertheless, I cherish Sweet Charity as a kind of threshold to  Fosse's masterpiece: Cabaret. Really unsurpassed as a backstage musical.
630575067X|3.0|Well I'm no great fan of sci-fi but there is a magic about Star Wars I don't doubt so curiosity and childhood memories dragged me to the cinema to check out the new face of Star Wars. The beauty of the original Star Wars  films was their ability to make the glittering effects a part of the story,  not just a distraction. In a time now of special effects but stale films it  is near impossible to make a Star Wars film to live up to the expectations  of the fans. Given what they were up against I think the makers of The  Phantom Menace were on the right lines. Dodgy characters and tacky acting  aside it has that Star Wars touch to it.<br />So what was wrong with the  acting? Liam Neeson does a fantastic job with Obi-Wan, his character almost  single-handedly holding the atmosphere together. Ewan McGregor is a bit  more stale but the rest of the cast pretty much stink. It wasn't till R2D2  popped up and started warbling that a smile returned to my face and I  remembered I was still watching Star Wars.<br />Unfortunately the problem with  Star Wars is that it is such a commercial prospect for toy companies and  suchlike that we inevitably get the `kiddy' aspect which comes in the form  the Jar Jar character. I wanted to cry with embaressment.<br />What this  lacked was the mystery and the suspense that existed in The Empire Strikes  Back, instead the makers have gone for the more commercial childs version  that was Return of the Jedi. Its all a matter of what audience to please  and all the Star Wars films have the same atmosphere but approached at  different angles. We'll probably find the next one is a lot darker as we  are led up to the Star Wars so many know and love.<br />Theres plenty of  moments in here that shine but its a case of glueing them all together. The  moments which oozed Star Wars magic for me were the fantastic fight  sequence with Darth Maul towards the end, the enemy soldier robot things  and the general atmosphere of the Emperor himself. More of this and less of  the Jar-Jar guy please, lets have a Star Wars film more for the adults than  for the kids next time so we all get a taste of the pie.<br />ps : wanted to  give it 3 and a half stars.
0553296981|5.0|Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has since become a world classic -- a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a 13 year old Jewish  girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For  the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo,  they and another family lived cloistered in the &quot;Secret Annexe&quot;  of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced  hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and  the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne frank  recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns  thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating  commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a  sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut  short.<br />It is a truly remarkable book.
0679735909|5.0|There is not the slightest hint of schmaltz in this modern Romance (the caps on the &quot;R&quot; are important); in fact the first person I recommended it to complained that the first 100 pages were terribly dry.   Once she got past them, however, she agreed with me: it's an astonishingly  good read.<br />_Possession_ starts with a discovery: an unfinished letter in  a book belonging to a long-dead Victorian poet.  At first the ramifications  of this are unexplained, but soon it falls into place.  Love and mystery,  disenchantment and discovery make up this perfect novel.  Several times I  had to pause and catch my breath.  This is one of the most significant  works of the 1990s.
6302610702|5.0|What a wonderful story.  Anyone who dislikes these films doesn't know what good cinema is.  In spite of their tremendous length, I never got bored with any of the three.  Watch them and love them.  A great gift to give to  someone.
B000005H40|5.0|33 years later and this CD is brought to you updated but still a classic. The title track is one to never forget. Take a trip back in time, circa 1957, big cars, cheap gas, cool music to listen to while cruisin down the  highway. For those of you old enough this will be nostalgia, for those  younger this is your roots. Before hip hop there was jazz, before jazz  there was be bop. This was made originaly during that transitional period  when the new idiom was being defined. Enter Trane and his signature sound  of soaring sax grown out of his apprenticeship with Dizzy Gillespie and  Miles Davis. You'll hear wonderful solos in the classic jazz tradition, one  instrument after another , each complementing the other. There is no doubt  who the leader is though, it is Trane, who also penned four tunes for this  classic. One of the many treats on this CD is the personnel, this is one of  his finer groupings. Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones compliment Trane as  they worked together under the master Miles Davis. That they understand the  nuances of Trane is an understatement as they blend and fuse a superb  rhythm section. The addition of Lee Morgan who at the time was just one of  the new young lions on trumpet is cool jazz defined. The blues have never  sounded better than on this swinging bluesy collection of now Trane  classics. Here is what you get that you won't on other versions of this LP  original. Outtakes of Blue Train and Lazy Bird that show the diversity of  the originals that are more known. Also the enhanced feature allows you two  see the master at work and provides some interesting biographical  information provided by through interviews and recollections. Blue Note has  packaged up a gem for all to enjoy now with modern technology as an aid.  This CD is a classic for both the fan and the uninitiated listener of the  greatest sax man to date, John Coltrane.
6305603847|5.0|I have only recently discovered Pink Floyd.  However, I already own 3 CDs (The Wall, Is There Anybody out There? and Dark Side of the Moon) and now I have just seen this DVD version of the movie.  It is one of the greatest  films of all time.  The animation is superb, and the story is well  translated.  The only pitfall of the movie is that some of the album's  songs are missing, changed or replaced to better fit the movie.  Other than  that, however, I can say no ill against it.
B0000073NC|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite metal album of all time.  For 1974, this album is so far ahead of its time.  Although the lyrics are not the greatest, it really doesn't matter because you have a MASTER guitar player  in Ulrich Roth.  I still remember the first time I listened to this record  I was so amazed by his work in songs like &quot;They Need A Million&quot;  &quot;Fly People Fly&quot; and the title track (which is ONLY available on  the Japan Import onf this album).  You can if you appreciate NWOBHM bands  and early 80s thrash metal, pick this album up and you will be in for a  REAL treat!
6303187064|5.0|The tragic story of shelly Webster and Eric Draven is butifly portrayed in this excalent gothic movie. The script has a few veriations on the original comic strip by J O'BARR but still has the same impact as the dark comic. This film will leave you stuned and amazed. Brandon Lee (1965 - 1993) gives  an amasing preformance as the torcherd soul of Eric in the best preformance  of his sadly short carier. The fact that the son of the martial arts  superstar Bruce Lee died while making this film dose put a few people off  watching it but he insisted that it was relised as he awated the abaliance  muinets before he died. The bad guy's in this film a wonderfully evil, they  are made up off all the things that a bad guy should and more. I personly  love this film and have become a devoted fan after seing it and I have no  doubt that you will to.
B000001DYD|5.0|The reviewer below said exactly what I was going to write for MY review, but that's okay, maybe it'll drive the message. A lot of people dismiss this album simply because of the way that Steve Albini produced it, saying  you can barely hear her voice (so turn it up, then! adjust the sound knobs  on your stereo!). I bought this album, at first, to fill in that missing  space in my P.J. Harvey collection. I listened to it a few times, skipped a  bunch of tracks because I couldn't get past the first five seconds of them,  and then I didn't try anymore. So it sat on my shelf collecting dust for  months. And months. I forgot about it. Recently I dragged out all the cds I  have that I never really gave a decent listen to, and only listened to  those. This album made it into my cd player a few days ago, and I was blown  away. Completely. 100%. Now I have to say that this is one of her best,  along with &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;- although they aren't alike. If  you own it and haven't given it a fair listen, please do. Set aside some  time and get some good headphones, and don't skip ANY tracks.
6304500483|3.0|This film makes for a pretty lame sequell to its predocesser The Crow starring Brandon Lee. Though it dose not match up to the first movie it is still a good movie if you are willing not to compare the two. I did enjoy this film and it is defintly worth buying if you are a crwo fan, but be  prepared to be sightly dissopointed at first. When you watch it the second  time round it is a lot better, you have recoverd from the inital  dissipointmant are can appretiat the film for what it is. Vinccent Prez is  not the best person to play Ashe in my opinion and his acsent is sometime  hard to understand. all in all this is a good film but is not the original!

0671027344|4.0|&quot;The Perks of Being A Wallflower&quot; is much more than a lamenting teeny-bopper diatribe against life. It is a good story about being real in the face of enemies, and about living life to the fullest. Although it wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, I recommend it to anyone with 2  hours, a sense of humor, and some un-named question stored in the back of  their mind. 4 stars
0061020710|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've read.  I had a smile on my face the whole time, and I laughed out loud multiple times.  The humor is the best I've seen.  It's all about Rincewind the Wizard (he runs from  everything) and Twoflower the Tourist (the first of the species to evolve  on the Discworld).  Accompanying them are: The Luggage, loyal to its owner  and homicidal to everything else; Hrun the Barbarian, who helps them  through the Wyrmberg and the Sender of Eight's Temple; and, of course,  Death (here's how to tell who he is: he ALWAYS SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS).   A must-read for any Douglas Adams fan.

B00003CX6P|5.0|This Movie is a masterpiece!. One of my Top 10 of All time. Matt Damon is excellent as Tom Ripley a poor man who wants to take over the Life of Dickie Greenleaf{ An Excellent Jude Law}. <br />The Supporting cast Was Also  Excellent! Gwetheyn Paltrow in an Oscar deserving performance is so  Wonderful. Cate Blanchett  is wonderful as well.<br />I have only 1 complaint  of TMR is the awful Singing by Matt Damon and Jude Law{ it was VERY  BAD! }  This was look over at the Oscars but this is  the Best movie Of  the Year.<br />Hats off to Anthony Mingalla for brining us a modern day  masterpiece!<br />Talented Mr Ripley: A+
B000002UJQ|3.0|With all the hype and glowing reviews surrounding this band, I looked forward to hearing what this band sounded like.  I was sorely disappointed.  There are moments of hope when the music approaches a tenderness creating  a melodic atmosphere but it too quickly disappears into the jumble of noise  that this band seems to stockpile. As far as the lyrics and songwriting  goes, where are they?  This is pure nonsense.  These guys don't know how to  write songs.  You can see that the ideas are there, but, the expression of  them is missing.  Any comparison with Pink Floyd is foolish and erroneous.   They neither have the musical nor lyrical quality and intelligence that  Pink Floyd has.  That is why Pink Floyd have remained so popular and  inspirational to many bands.  Radiohead should rethink their artistic  direction and raise their head out of the dirt and take a deep breath.
B000003BDY|4.0|For which reason ever, this never was among my favourites, it may be, because it mainly includes cover versions, and I love to hear own songs, because when it comes to writing classic lines, nobody comes close to  Jagger&amp;Richards. However, this album is already the right step into the  direction of self-written and more rocky sounds. The best cuts here are the  beautiful classic TIME IS ON MY SIDE and their first #1- hit IT'S ALL OVER  NOW. I can understand, that after the artistic and commercial success of  the latter, the song was covered back by Bobby Womack. I agree about most  of the other tracks' being average (or some maybe a bit above). As a whole,  the album is a not uninteresting early work of the original r'n'b band,  before it became the rich and old greatest rock'n'roll band of the world. I  only hate the missing connection between the songs, as this &quot;studio  album&quot; is compiled material of different singles, albums and E.P.s.  Why not sticking to the good old British originals?
6304806426|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this film, it's such a touching story between Ralph Fiennes (who does an amazing job) and Kristin Scott Thomas, as well as  Juliette Binoche, who you cry along with every time a tragedy occurs in her  life.  You grow to love all the characters, and the two story lines blend  together perfectly to create a masterpiece that deserved every oscar it  won.  A must see for any Fiennes and Binoche fan.  Great job Anthony  Minghella!
0385470819|4.0|Two white men beat, rape and almost kill a young black girl in Clanton, Mississippi.  Her outraged father kills them in a vengeful rage.  He is arrested and charged with their murders.<br />Now the question of his guilt or innocence faces everyone involved. His lawyer, the sheriff, the judge and  the jury all have to decide for themselves whether his violent act was  justifiable in his circumstances.<br />Considering the deep south location of  the story and the time in which it takes place, racism plays a large role  in the story.  The question of the father's guilt is only compounded by the  racial barrier.<br />Grisham's story of justice, morality and racism grips the  reader from the beginning.  Although Grisham wanders at some points, the  intricate plot pulls the reader through the slow points and towards the  climax.<br />Grisham's smooth and convincing style of storytelling greatly  outweighs the slightly meandering storyline.  This book is one of his best  and is an intriguing and thought provoking look at our system of justice.
0792844793|5.0|David Lynch's masterpiece film, Blue Velvet is an overpowering look at the evil that lurks amongst the normalities of everyday life.  Boiled down to the basics, Blue Velvet is a good-guys vs. bad-guys crime story, but the  subplots and emotional tensions create a film unlike any I have ever seen.   This is not a film for those who are easily disturbed by troubling images,  however, I think that anyone who watches it must be impressed by its total  originality in the way it tells a story.      As a matter of fact, this  film is much more accessible to film lovers than many of Lynch's other  films, in that the underlying plot is actually very straight-forward, and  wraps up in a logical conclusion.  Compare this to the mish-mash of  something like Lost Highway, and it is easy to see why Blue Velvet has been  hailed as such a brilliant piece of work.      I must admit that the acting  (except for Dennis Hopper's tremendous performance) overall is not of the  highest caliper, but the overall force of the story renders this a moot  point.  This is a great movie, and any film lover who has not yet seen it  should check out this fine DVD edition.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Viewinng this star-studded (quasi horror but more of an) action/adventure flick is an immensely entertaining joyride!  Practically all actors and actresses involved played their respective parts perfectly, almost as if  they were born for these roles. Which is indeed very surprising - who  would've thought that Depp, for instance, could portray a convincing (and  hilarious!) Ichabod Crane?<br />A lot has been said about the plot /  atmosphere of this film so I will steer clear of these.  What I wanted to  comment on, however, was the well-choreographed fight scenes, using two  blades instead of one.  As an amateur &quot;arnis&quot; / stickfighting  afficionado, I found these particular scenes truly fun to watch, and I  believe that they're a fine testament to the growing popularity and  &quot;high screen impact&quot; of this particular martial art.<br />Again the  excellent performances by all the cast (not only Depp and Ricci but also  the support roles such as Brom Van Brunt played by Starship Trooper's  &quot;Johnny Rico&quot; Casper Van Dien, and the actor whose name currently  escapes me but who played the role of Major Duncan Heyward in Michael  Mann's Last of the Mohicans). Kudos likewise goes to the headless Hessian  Horseman himself, Christopher Walken, who proved that great actors need not  be given speaking lines to exhibit their remarkable talents.<br />This is a  no-brainer - BUY THIS DVD! I know I will, as soon as it comes out.  I'm  sure it will make a fine and &quot;rewatchable&quot; addition to anyone's  collection.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is compleate and udder genius! Mike Portnoy, and John Petrucci should be given not only an award for producing, and playing on one of the best albums ever, but also an Oscar and a Tony for writing a story line far  more complex then most movies or Broadway shows! I'm 16 years old, most of  what I listen to is metal, mostly the new stuff, I like Machine Head,  SlipKnot, Slayer, PanterA,  TOOL, stuff like that. But these guys, and Rush  are the 2 most talented bands I have ever heard. Their also 2 of my  favorites. I am a bassist and am really fasinated by John Myung! the guy is  inhuman! The same can be said for John Petrucci! Amazing!  Why aren't  these guys more appreciated! Has Limp Bizkit seeped too deep in to todays  culture that they can't hear this awsome, unspeakibly tight band!  Its  quite sad!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is, well, they are real. These 9 guys from Iowa are as scarry or as real as they can get. I don't mean their disturbingly creepy/cool masks, I mean their music. The lyrics that the absolutely amazing vocalist Corey  Taylor('8' as his band ID suggests) sings out from behind that mask only  make sense in this truly diluted world. With every single word the listener  can hear his pain. In 'Scissors' he goes into a sort of trance of insanity  where he seems to cry and laugh maniacly at the same time while singing  &quot;life,time&quot; over and over again. With every single one of those  we feel like he is really hurting. And this is something only a few bands  can do (or have done in case of KoRn-they still have a chance people! ).  The two percussionists 6-Shawn and 3-Chris are absolutely amazing and  original. Same with 1-Joey. Every member of this incredible band is 101  percent with the music, everyone knows their instrument. They even have  0-Sid, a DJ who kicks some major MTV DJ Scribble ass. Now how often do you  see that in a metal band. The tag team of guitars coming out of 4-James and  7-Mick are really vivid and it really shows that these guys are on their  game. Let's not forget the pig masked 2-Paul and 5-Craig. Paul makes some  nice sounds come out of his piece and Craig does an incredible job of  putting out some creepy sounds. This band is definetly original and the  sound they bring out makes you want to go truly nuts. My favorite songs on  this CD are the ones where Corey actually sings and the way he can switch  between the screaming out loud death sound to a pain filled melody is  incredible. This would be 'Wait and Bleed, Me Inside, Prosthetics,  Dilutedm, and Scissors.'. But the CD's best is Me Inside. And while you  listen to Scissors and actually let the track run, you will find a  sickeningly hilarious recording which will make you laugh and realize that  these guys are just liek everyone else. They are human. Final words,  Slipknot'smusic shines in today's too much misuderstood world. These guys  are real and the lyrics that come out of Corey's mouth are real. It might  be hard to get used to but if you listen to it with an open mind, you will  quickly realize you are listening to truly amazing music. This should be 10  stars but unfortunately I can only give 5. This is a really meaningful  album. Slipknot is here to stay for a while, you can be sure abbout that.
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code is the Greatest piece of work pearl jam has ever done. In no way do i say that the other albums arent great but this is the best. There is no weak song on this album. (there always seems to be one..  &quot;Pilate&quot; &quot;Bugs,&quot; Stupid Mop&quot; Etc.)    &quot;Sometimes is a wonderful song... hail hail is at times overdone but  still great.. who you are is a classic, in my tree took time to grow on me,  but i now love it, smile is repetitive but finishes strong, off he goes is  an amazing story as is habit. LUKIN IS JUST FUN. red mosquito, present  tense, around the bend.. &quot;Im Open &quot; is the best spoken song ever.
B000002URV|5.0|This is my favorite CD of all time and I listen to it everyday. It is truly amazing. If you are thinking about getting it.. GET IT!

067144901X|5.0|I received Moo, Baa, La La La at a baby shower and started reading it to my son when he was 4 months old.  Even at that age, he responded with coos and much arm waving when we brought out this book.  It was the first book he laughed out loud at, and now at 9 months, he still gets excited when we  sit to down to read it.  (My husband and I also enjoy it and have often  found ourselves quoting it -- to the confusion of anyone who overhears us.)
B000005RW4|5.0|Other positive reviewers have basically said it all, and I wanted to praise their insight and add this: I've had this only as a record album since it was first released. As another reviewer mentioned, it IS almost  like a bootleg album, as it is most difficult to find. His &quot;Old  Ways,&quot; and &quot;Are There Anymore Real Cowboys,&quot; speaks to the  heart of this kind of music, and to the heart of those who share Mr.  Young's longings and feelings.  This is definitely a treasure to hoard if  you have it! Practically all the cuts from this album are wonderful.  Others, besides the two just mentioned, that deserve mention are: &quot;Get  Back to the Country, and &quot;My Boy.&quot;  For ANYONE who longs for the  &quot;old ways,&quot; you owe it to yourself to find this album!
B00000DQSV|5.0|This is the album Nile Rodgers built.  And Duran Duran, as well.  From the energetic title track to the doo-wop inspired &quot;Skin Trade&quot; to the sweet &quot;Matter of Feeling&quot; (inspired by Roger Taylor's departure)  to the rocking &quot;Hold Me&quot; to the mournful &quot;Winter Marches  On&quot;, everything has its funky place.  The bass lines have never been  stronger, and having then-session player Warren Cuccurullo on board helped  bring in a more mature sound guitar-wise.  Nick Rhodes of course kept the  electronic vibe going and Simon LeBon performed his strongest vocals.  Very  delicious and mature.  And since I got my anti-Duran offline friend Monica  to say &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;Meet El Presidente&quot;'s funkdafied  flavor, I'd say it's more than well worth the money.
B00004STDN|5.0|I have this movie in normal edition,all I can say about this DVD is the fantastic beginning,which works like an invitation for the rest of the movie.Stallone stands  like co-star of Lithgow,the bad guy, and that`s  good.Great work of Renny Harlin and all the support cast.Ah,with the  extras,worth the 5 stars.
B000002U8A|4.0|People often mistake Duran Duran for a pop group; this is probably the album they base that &quot;information&quot; on.  This is the only album in their catalog that is straight-ahead pure pop, very heavily synthesized  from beginning to end.  They do take some risks in the middle (&quot;Of  Crime and Passion&quot; and &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; rely on  then-untested hooks, &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot; is a pure instrumental,  &quot;The Seventh Stranger&quot; an epic weepy), but the rest is  straight-ahead pop.  &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;, a song the band now  hate, is actually quite good.  I would recommend this album as a good  follow-up to &quot;Rio&quot; to anyone musically exploring the group.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Living in England its hard to follow bands like slipknot and korn but for some reason slipknot have hit big while after 4 albums korn haven't. Seeing them in the u.k. was mad shawn jumped on a 15 year old girl from a balcony  and put her in hospital for weeks! The album is refreshing almost like  korns debut or life is peachy but i feel like korn they will get more and  more commericalised and the music will tone down (like korn) I couldn't  possibley define their music so call it what u want , overhere they prefer  nu-metal or sports metal. From the opening track to when it links perfectly  into sic and to wait and bleed (the most accessible track on the album) it  kind of gives the listener a buzz! Instead of writing how great it is i  personally have been listening to them for about 5 months. I would  recommend the album to buy now as there are no other albums on the horizon  (if u don't count pearl jams new album). When u have listened to the album  and still aren't impressed then go see them if u can and u will start to  appreicate the album better. Unlike korn , slipknot are focusing on the  international scence unlike other american bands they announce tours and  festivals for the u.k. Any british people reading this should get  themselves down to redaing/leeds festival as i belive they will truely  shine!
B000001FY9|5.0|In my humble opinion, &quot;Legend&quot; is the absolute best album ever put together.  No matter your mood, Bob is there waiting for you with the perfect song. Whether he's bringing to you an overwhelming sense of  tranquility, telling a tale, encouraging to &quot;stand up for your  right,&quot; or simply &quot;Jamming,&quot; Marley shows his beautiful  talent, by making you FEEL.   Bob Marley is always there, and he will  always be there.  His music will forever carry his legacy and his message.
B0000399WI|4.0|My friend told me to watch this movie and at first, I thought it would be boring but then as I watched the movie I was more interested. I especially like the ending. I am not much of a book reader, but the ending reminded me  of a book called Ten Little Indians by Agatha Christie. Morgan Freeman was  especially funny in this movie. I enjoyed his role playing the friend of  our shy banker.
B00000K19E|5.0|Matrix is a perfect example of how a movie can shine brighter on DVD. The sound effects were great and crystal clear and the extras are the best I have seen. The viewer has the option of watching the movie as normal,  except when a white rabbit icon appears, you can click it and see the  special effects scene being created. When the &quot;extra scene&quot; is  finished, the movie picks up where it was.<br />As for the movie... I found  the plot original albeit a little difficult to follow. Like most people, I  think &quot;K. Reeves = Topical plot&quot;. Well that is wrong in this  case. I have watched the movie several times without boredom setting in.  The stunts, effects and action are fresh for a high budget movie.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This is primo stuff here people. I am a huge rage fan and this album just puts them higher than ever. Every album improves from the last..all are classics by the way. Every single song on this album, every minute is  perfect. Its one of those albums that once you turn it on, you cannot skip  songs. Every song has a new orignal flavor to it. Rage has not only one of  the best live shows( saw them in philly '99), they have one of the best  build bands around. Zack's vocals are faster and sharper than an blade. Tom  morrello has to be if not the one of the best guitar players of this  generation. He is unbelievable. Tim's bass just sets everything perfectly,  and brad wilk plays the drums with fury and unbelievable power. I will  definately recommend it.
0060920386|5.0|Picture characters with the massive egos and ruthlessness of a James Ellroy novel. (OK, take away most of the violence and add lots more money.) Add in the daffiness of Dave Barry. Then make it about a business deal.<BR> That's what you've got here. I would never have believed a book about  real-life financial maneuvers could be so fascinating. The whole wall  streeters as twisted megalomaniacs thing --- that's just a cartoonish  stereotype, right? Maybe not. I once worked as a court reporter, and during  a break at an SEC deposition a lawyer from Skadden-Aarps noticed I was  reading this book. &quot;I did some work on the RJR case,&quot; he  said.<BR> &quot;Is F. Ross Johnson as crazy as this book makes him  sound?&quot; I asked.<BR> &quot;Ross? Oh, yeah. He's a loon,&quot; the  lawyer replied.<BR> Instead of a snooze-inducing retelling of the business  pages, you get a funny, shocking and intriguing book. 600 pages go by in a  flash. It's a great read.
B00002E233|1.0|The story is very clear from the beginning. The characters are standardized. The bloody &quot;effects&quot; are easy predictable too.<br />I am really tired of those modern &quot;scientific&quot; movies. If you hear  &quot;genetic engineering&quot; in the beginning - surely there will be a  monster in the end. Sometimes I wish academic science had its own  &quot;antidefamation league&quot;...
0792837916|5.0|Great movie. Great performances all around - especially by Travolta, whose Chili Palmer ranks as one of the coolest characters ever. Loved that scene of him ascending the restaurant staircase.<BR><BR> One quick nit to pick:  contrary to a review recently posted (below) - Get Shorty was indeed  written by Elmore Leonard, but LA Confidential (also superb) is by James  Ellroy.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's game is a wonderful book for all ages.  I Usually I stick to reading fantasy but my friend turned me on to Enders game. I cannot thank her enough. I read a lot of books, that includes a lot of trash. Finally I  found a book that stands apart from most of the others. This book offers an  indepth look into the human mind and emotions. I found this book utterly  beautiful and imaginitive. A mix of horror and awareness that left me  speechless. I recomend this book for sci-fi readers with intelegence.
0553275976|4.0|I loved A Man in Full and Bonfire was equal to the task.  The book read well and the Dickensian descriptions showed up but not enough to be put off by them.  The ending lacked the completness that A Man in Full had, which  was part of the idea behind Bonfire.  It was an enjoyable read and I  recommend it but again, the book does leave you hanging.  Everything comes  together in a  stew of egos, desires and greed...but the stew just wore a  lil thin for my own taste.
0792101448|5.0|Those three minutes or so of Claudia Cardinale taking that bubble bath are reason enough to get this.

B00003CWPL|5.0|This film would be ideal for the following types of people: - people who have numb arms - people who are impotent - people who have long hair - people who are named 'x' - people who eat dancing quails - people who live  inside planets - people who find mutated sperm sticking out of their  girlfriends' backs - people who are tired of work - people who are  attracted to their neighbors - people who collect pencils - people who  dance - people who like girls with bad skin - people who play organ -  people who believe in heaven<br />If you are one of those... you should find  this film and watch it.  If only Amazon.com would get it.  otherwise, do  the illegal thing and find a bootleg.... oh, the horror.

0792156684|3.0|The brilliance of the subtext of the mise-en-scene that can only be described as &quot;Cameronian&quot; contains magical attempts at recreating the atmospheric retro-diegetic which naturally creates an impending  dialogue between the film and Welles' &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;  for obvious reasons that are too miniscule to discuss here.  The delicate  inbalance between tension in form and looseness in style can best be  described as octavian in its mirror-like function as both the signifier and  the signified, representing a subtext that relies on not only a working  knowledge of frame of reference in terms of the working axis of  familiarization in visual poetics but also along the same lines as a  chrystalis from unison of sound and substance (as defined in terms of moral  vs. mere action), which is best seen in the scene when the girl gets naked  in front of leo. i must be weary of course because the logical compulsion  is to label the film in terms of a kind of kafkaesque melodramatic  pseudocomedic tendencies of either a Kubrick or a Wenders, but the real  truth is that Titanic, despite its obvious references to depth of focal  objectification in the Bazanian sense of the phrase with its constant  attempts at redefining what the frame of reference should be for the  moviegoer (an effect that can only be called perhaps neo-confucian  bolshevism in terms of its political and philosophical subtext), should be  called a film about the consideration of the very word &quot;pathos&quot;  in the context of post-modernistic visual collage.  The temporal symbiosis  of both young and old best represents the duality within Cameron's work in  general (think of the dual terminators, or perhaps the duality between the  regular and the mutated pirahnas in Pirahna part 2: THE SPAWNING).  thus,  Titanic must be seen in this context.  otherwise, don't even bother to  watch it because you won't understand it at all.
6305750750|4.0|The first time I watched this, I was not overly impressed.  There was no way this could ever have lived up to my expectations after all these years.  I have sinced watched it about 3 more times and find that I can really  appreciate it now for what it is.  Is it as good as any movie in the first  trilogy?  Not really.  Is it the piece of garbage everybody seems to think  they're cool by saying it is?  Not by a long shot, folks.  There are  definitely some great moments here and some fine acting.  High points?  The  light sabre battles here make the ones from the first trilogy seem like  they're in slow motion - and Darth Maul is one tough customer indeed.  The  pod race was awesome (this scene is the best argument ever for widescreen  over pan and scan),  and one of the coolest parts in the movie for me were  the tusken radiers shooting at the pods - great touch!  Also, there are a  lot of hidden things you might not notice the first few times.  A perfect  example is when Watto is talking to Qui Jon after the pod race and you can  see (and hear) one of Darth Maul's probe droids whiz by behind them.   Brilliant.  Now, the low points:  JarJar drives me insane.  He must be  considered a noble failure and I can only hope that Lucas sends him on some  inter-stellar turd hunt in the next film.  He's really not that bad, but he  has more screen time than just about anybody.  Also, the announcers for the  pod race still make me cringe every time.  Overall, I thought this was a  fine movie, and I would encourage those of you trying to be cool by bashing  it to at least watch the thing again and give it a chance.  Bring on  Episode II!
6303593135|5.0|Jean Seberg makes me want to buy the New York Herald Tribune.   ...grrr.... Buy this film.  If not for Jean S., then for the fact that it's ok.
0380002930|5.0|I have sincerely never read a better book in my lifetime.  However, in order to enjoy it you need to have an open mind and a sense of imagination. It may seem difficult to begin, but once you've been drawn in to the story, you will never want to stop reading it.  I sometimes feel the necessary  urge to watch a movie twice that truly gets to me, or gets me so excited  and full of some sort of magical, inexplicable energy that I cannot get it  out of my system until I have seen it twice. This was the first novel that  clutched me so, and the summer before ninth grade, when I had to read it  for school, I ended up reading it twice, feeling the vivid emotion as  intensely the second time as the first.  I've lost count of how many times  I have read it now, and every time I read it I pick up on new, exhilarating  details.  The story is simply charming, with numerous metaphors and  adventures.  It is one of those books where you feel yourself sitting up in  anticipation, as well as jumping up and down with joy.  This novel is also  just as humorous as adventurous, in fact, it's hilarious.  Clearly, WD  contains EVERYTHING a good novel, in my opinion, should: adventure, humor,  a touch of sadness, friends, life-and-death situations, imagination,  metaphor, intellect..etc. etc. I could go on forever, but I will stop now.   Please, at least give this book a chance: if there is even a slight  possibility that you could be blessed with the intense, thought-evoking  feelings it has awakened in me, then it's worth it.  This is my favorite  book of all times.
6305750750|2.0|For the uninitiated, the G. Lucas American film series about warfare amongst the stars is a peculiar look at parallel universes and strange creatures interacting with humans in an attempt to secure peace throughout  the galaxy.  Indeed, this war amongst the stars, or &quot;Star Wars&quot;  as it is called, is indeed a film series about love and betrayal, incest  and abandonment, good midgets and bad midgets, strange fish creatures with  too much power, and robots.  Indeed, this film series (whose art house  qualities remind the intellectual filmgoer of the Decalogue in scope, or  perhaps a parallel can be best made between Star Wars and the Trois  Couleurs Trilogy, in that both series exhibit semi-paradoxical tendencies  for the both the surreal and the comic while trying to maintain at least  some semblance of the post-modernistic cliche of parallel bereavement and  longing for the freudian (or perhaps jungian would be better) other in that  the subconscious is always expressed in terms of pseudo-violence, usually  directed towards the self but often manifested in the form of senseless  destruction against establishment regulation.  It is important to remember  this war amongst the stars in these quasi-anthropological terms, for the  genesis of such serial work too can have its roots in the experimental  (think of the obvious parallels between Return of the Jedi and, say, Man  With a Movie Camera). With that in mind, Star Wars Episode  One...<br />...sucks.
B00003CWN2|3.0|Hilary Swank was grate in this movie and you hav eto give her credit because this was a hard role to play. Chloe Sevigny was also grate in this movie. But this movie did have its rusty moments.
B000002N3J|5.0|Smoldering, seductive, plaintive, self-reflective. So many strong emotions overtake the listener as Madonna takes us through the depths of her emotions. &quot;Something to Remember&quot; truly is an unforgettable  collection of her greatest ballads.<br />Opening and closing on takes of the  Marvin Gaye classic &quot;I Want You&quot;, the listener is taken on a  journey of Madonna's abilities as a chameleon of musical styles and  interpreter of emotions. Wrapping her vocals around big productions like  &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;You'll See&quot;, she presents the same feeling  of intimacy as she does the smaller scale tracks, like the jazz-tinted  title track and the incredibly spare &quot;One More Chance&quot;.<br />This  album is even better than the deservedly successful &quot;Immaculate  Collection&quot;. Some Madonna fans would account that as blasphemy, but  you need only see her growth on this album to show you how incredible an  artist she really is.  Taken away from the uptempo dance hits that made her  a household name, she shows a maturity that cements her as a collaborator,  vocalist, writer and producer to be reckoned with.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I love this music I got it becasue of the Roswell theme mainly. I did not even new who sang tthat song untill last night when I was flipping chanels and heard that song. I am so happy I know who it is and so happy I have  there cd. I would have given them 5 stars but some of the songs I dont care  for.
0782011098|1.0|Nice, light-hearted comedy but the quality of the DVD transfer is dreadful. This is the second Artisan disc I have bought, the other being The Quiet Man, and definitely the last. The sound is muffled and the video  is blurred throughout. Still, I suppose it's an improvement on The Quiet  Man, which along with its blurred picture had no sound! <br />By the way, the  fault does not lie with my home theatre system, which has been properly  calibrated  by an ISF-trained expert.
B000023X9W|5.0|This CD is incredible.  Mellow to the point of being dream-like.  Buy it, throw it in the CD player and catch the sunrise with a cup of coffee.  Every track is exceptionally delicate and sweet.
0030514924|4.0|I recently read this book, and it is definetly a brilliant book. I don't rate it 5 stars, because there are lots of other books that happen to be better, but I really enjoyed it, and it will make my top 10 List,  definetly.<br />I am sure you've all heard the story of the old Scrooge, and  how he is haunted by 3 ghosts:  Ghost of the past Ghost of the present  Ghost of the future.<br />It is very good, and I hope that if you haven't read  it, you read it soon. It's very fun, and you'll love it!
0780622553|5.0|First of all I m not gonna use the word &quot;similar&quot;. This movie is unique. Truly and purely unique. If you think about universal mysteries, the future and past of humankind, aliens your desperate cries will reach  end. Dark city makes a historical movement and giving all the possible  answers for your life-long questions. Alex Proyas delivers not only true  potential of a sci fi movie but also critisizing human history. Film itself  has a great plot and story. The cinematography reaches purification of  using light throughout movie. Everyone pointed  out the perfect fx  directing of Matrix but they missed Dark City's merged breathtaking both  sound and visual effects. The crew perfect  especially Keiffer Sutherland  portrayed a doctor again (he was a good appr.Doc in Flatliners)and this  time he reaches a perfect combination. his acting talking truly addictive.   Rufus Sewell also delivering a great performance.  Do i have to say  something about Connely or Hurt. Actually i recommend this movie to  anyone.If you accidentally think that Matrix is a milestone think again,  once you walk on the dark streets of the Dark City. You ll find the truth.  And one special note; stop weeping around because of Kubrick's death.Proyas  is still alive and he is so young..and Australia.. see.. not just the  Hollywood  can reach the stars.
0783241542|5.0|American Pie is the funniest movie that I've ever seen.  Everyone has to see it.  Talk me word for it, it's hilarious.
0964385619|5.0|I'm an entrepreneurial pastor in California and I am overjoyed about what Robert Kiyosaki has written.  Some of the things he talks about I have even used in my sermons.  The thing that struck me most was leaving a legacy.   The Bible even says that &quot;a good man leaves an inheritance to his  children's children.&quot; Proverbs 13:22.  It's great to see a secular  book bring this point out.  I have used this book to talk with my own son  about leaving a legacy for his grandchildren.  Believe it or not, he's only  13.  I don't think it's to early to start teaching him about his role in  the prosperity of our family. Best of success to all of you who decide to  read this wonderful book. pastorcedric@earthlink.net
0451169514|5.0|How can you not love this book. Overall The best by King. I however didnt find it to frightening but is very suspensful and keeps you on your seat. Confusing sometimes but isnt that what good books are suppose to be? To  make you think to open your mind and heart to possiblitys.
6302767741|5.0|I loved this movie. I'm a big Branagh fan, and caught this in passing on Bravo network. I was hooked. I was also thrilled to see a film with Tony Slattery in it, playing an atypical role. He did very well; I was impressed  and pleased. It's not a light-hearted movie, but it is heartwarming  overall. And yes, Americans might have trouble with some of the British  humor; I always seem to. But as long as you like British humor, I don't  think it makes a major difference in how you feel about the movie.
6303855474|4.0|This is one of Stallone's under rated movies. Like Demolition Man it got bashed instead of praised. The action is well done and Stallone is perfect as Dredd. Those who like to be entertained with loud special effects and  violence will find this to their interest.
0812523334|5.0|OK, so after the 17 hundredth time (yes, I'm exaggerating), I have finally finished Little Women, and I'm so glad that I did! It's so totally excellent, and each chapter has a moral. Like, not to be vain or to not waste time or to not put much stock in riches, for money never was the  equivalent to true love and happiness. I cried &amp; sobbed, and laughed  and just generally thought &quot;I wish I were as contented as Beth, or as  clever as Jo, beautiful as Amy &amp; charismatic as Meg.&quot; You fall in  love with each of these girls, and Miss Alcott gave such a perfect  description. I LOVE this book! Read it, and you'll never regret it.  Pefection, pure and simple. It isn't any wonder that this book has turned  into such an American classic.
B000021XR5|5.0|This is a really cool album from heavy metal group, the 'Stone Temple Pilots'. The opening track, &quot;Down&quot; is a really cool song. &quot;No. 4&quot; is full of low, heavy rock. This is a must for any rock /  heavy metal fan.
B0000039LE|5.0|This is the first video in a set of 6 or 7. The 'Halloween' series is fantasrtic. It's about a boy who borrows a costume for trick-or-treat. This costume is evil and makes him get posessed by the devil. He starts killing  people! He kills his first person by the age of 6-8. The police work on it  and it goes on. Great Horror Movie!
B00000J8EK|5.0|The Chemical Brothers are the coolest dance artists in the world. &quot;Hey Boy, Hey Girl&quot;, &quot;Out of Control&quot; and &quot;Music: Response&quot; are the coolest dance songs I've ever heard. &quot;Hey Boy,  Hey Girl&quot; is the best ever dance song. I love this album!  The  Chemical Brothers totally rock!
630575067X|4.0|I thought that this movie was just as good or better better than Star Wars: A New Hope.    I don't get all you people who say that the story was dumb and it was all special effects, this story was better written than A  New Hope. I am not saying that it is a better story than &quot;A New  Hope&quot; because it is the same story; Young hero from Tatooine meets up  with a Jedi, leaves his home planet and family, meets royalty whom he falls  in love with, Jedi is killed by evil villian, he saves the day by blowing  up big starship.  You can't expect the first movie to be the best because  they have to put alot of backround in it to introduce the rest of the  movies and they have to get you to love about ten characters in a hour and  a half. I was a little disapionted when Liam Neeson's character died,  I  hope he comes back as a ghost in the next movie, like Ben Kenobi did in  &quot;The Emipire Strikes Back&quot;.  And I have to admit that Jar Jar did  get a bit annoying at times.  But I think that all you people that  completely obsessed with Sar Wars should get life, they are just movies.
0790725657|5.0|I have read the book and  have seen and own all three movie versions (Shirley Temple, BBC and this one) althouh the BBC on has the correct story, this is my favorite.  I don't care that they changed the story in  fact I liked it better this way.  I have probably seen this movie at least  15 times.  It is one of my all time favorite movies.  My favorite part is  when the indian guy does that mind thing with Sara's father and then her  father runs outside and screams on the top of his lungs &quot;Sara&quot;.   That part is so good. I could go on and on about all my other favorite  parts but that would take too long and I would end up talking about every  scene in the movie.  BUY IT!
6305177473|5.0|This movie has a wonderful story line for both children and adults.  It was very amusing and  enjoyable.  It's a modern version of the old favorite.  There were some minor details that refered back to events in the  older version.  Overall a very high quality movie.
B000031XCR|5.0|Any music fan should buy this album, because of the voice and songs behind it. Celine puts her heart and soul into recording every one of these songs, and although many of them may be familiar to you already, the new songs are  just as great. She shows her range in Frank Sinatra's &quot;All the  Way,&quot; in which she lends her vocals to the song, and also shows us  what she can do in songs like &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot; which is a  more modern type song. But she mainly stays in the range of her songs like,  &quot;To Love You More&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love.&quot; So, whether  you're an old or new fan of Celine, or whether you're just unsure of  whether or not to get it, my advice is go All the Way.
630575067X|3.0|Just like any other Star Wars fans, I awaited the 1st prequel with much anticipation &amp; glee.  But after viewing the movie, I asked myself, is this it.  I wasn't convinced &amp; back I went to the cinema for a second  viewing but still, the answer remained the same.  I had viewed the Star  Wars sequels countless of times but never I felt any sense of boredom  creeping in.  They all are classics to me &amp; they are that good!   Considering that the sequels were shot 20 years ago give &amp; take, George  Lucas' brilliance is undeniable.  This time around, with better technology,  special effects offered is definitely the highlight of the movie with the  much talked about pod racing, Jar Jar Bink which certainly provided a lot  of light hearted moment.  Natalie Portman's performance was quite  restrained, probably noticing that there's a massive responsibility for her  to carry over her shoulder, so as not to disappoint lots of legions of fans  for the Star Wars series.  Samuel Lawrence was quite subdued as a Jedi  &amp; I preferred to see him re-enacting his role in the Pulp Fiction, or  even his role in the Negotiator, anytime.  Liam Neeson provided a much  needed screen presence.  The highlight of the movie would be the duel  between the Jedis &amp; Darth Maul &amp; it's ashamed that Darth Maul was  killed off that simply.  For such a lethal opponent like him, he should be  leaving in a big bang rather than in the piece meal fashion as offered in  the movie.  Well, probably the fault solely lies on me, who has too high of  an expectation which the movie couldn't provide.  But to be truthful, no  matter how neat the presentation is, it's lacking of this thing called  soul.  Just hope that the second offering would be better or much improved.   Considering that the 2nd instalment is to be shot in Sydney, probably,  there's going to be a cameo appearance of creatures in the form of kangaroo  or koala bear that could sing &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;!
B000006JQ5|4.0|This is an exellent album if your just gettig into Iron Maiden, however a box set would of been better because there are alot of great tunes not on this album. I have just about all their albums so personally I wouldn't  waste my money on this album. You are better off making a CD of your  personal favorites
B00003CXDV|4.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for the longest time &amp; for that simple reason, my girl friend never bothered watching the series with me.  But then again, unknowingly, Star Trek's culture has imbedded into our day to  day living.  If you say phrases like &quot;Beam Me Up, Scottie&quot;;  &quot;Live Long &amp; Prosper&quot; whilst displaying the V sign, your  friends just understand immediately what you're implying.  Anyway, my girl  friend came with me to the cinema reluctantly &amp; she couldn't help  shaking her head noticing that the cinema was filled with males especially  the geeky type, something like me!  Anyway, when the movie started, she  couldn't help laughing her heads off with the goofy storyline.  On top of  the mockery of the Star Trek series, what I'm finding this movie endearing  is seeing all those familiar actors from TV series such as Elliott in Just  Shoot Me, Mitchell from Veronica's Closet, Tim Allen in Home Improvement,  the taxi guy from Wings strutting their stuff.  What's even amusing is  seeing Sigourney Weaver playing a busty bimbo (a far cry from her Ripley  role in Alien &amp; sequels), &amp; Alan Rickman virtually playing himself  as an actor with English theatre background forcing himself re-enacting the  role of  this Spock character again &amp; again &amp; still, the spotlight  is always taken by Tim Allen who's potraying the role of William Shatner.   What's even more delightful about the movie is that in the end, good  prevails over evil. The underlying themes of the movies would be the  significance of teamwork, &amp; self belief. A wonderful film to be shared  with family members &amp; friends.  What's even more unbelievable is that  my girl friend can't wait for the sequel, if there's any!  On the sideline,  Stan Winston, the special effect guy who had brought us the Alien creature  is in his usual best. By the way, the space ship is as corny as ever.
B0000028RR|5.0|Well this is where it all started with the 90's hardriffing &quot;avant garden&quot; group. Ironically, it is also their best release to date. Tracks like &quot;Bombtrack&quot;, &quot;Killing In the Name&quot;  &quot;Bullet In The Head&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot; are filled with raw  energy and pure attitude. RATM sure doesn't want to leave unclear of what  their message might be!  This album shows a band at the peak of their  career, because even though the band has kept their attitude going, there  are starting to repeat themselves, wich is not a veryy good thing on a  third album. Well, anyway, this album features pure rebell from the  all-telling cover art to the last sounds of &quot;Freedom&quot;, so it is a  definite album for anyone interseted in another way of world order.
B0000027I6|2.0|I will defend &quot;Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; and &quot;Radio KAOS&quot; until the bovines come home, but this disc truly makes one wonder if Roger Waters has lost it. Unfocused, untuneful, utterly  disappointing. There are about three good songs here and the rest is  repetitive, confusing, slow and, a first for Waters, not even very  interesting. What a letdown.
B00002Z88D|5.0|\\"S &amp; M\\" is a great album with a different sound from `Metallica'. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"One Leaf Clover\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" are really cool songs. This double disc set from `Metallica' rocks. They  perform well combining rock with classical. It sounds superb. Five stars.
B00000I600|5.0|This is one of the best works of Marc Almond and Dave Ball. This is the album that made me become a Soft Cell and a Marc Almond fanatic! The whole album is so good, you can let the whole thing play on your CD player,  cassette play, or whatever you have. My personal fav. songs on that album  are &quot;Seedy Films&quot;, &quot;Youth&quot; (The very first Soft Cell  song I've ever heard), &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, &quot;Bedsitter&quot;, and  a whole bunch of songs. If you or someone you know is starting to like Soft  Cell but don't know which album to buy, this is the one that made them  famous and the one I recommend.
630529142X|5.0|\\"The Water Boy\\" is a funny movie. Great Comedy. It's about a man who is a water boy for a football team. People tease him about been water boy. One day, he gets so angry with someone that he tackles them. This is one good  tackle. The coach of a bad football team sees his good tackle and allows  him to be in the team. He becomes a great footballer. Great Movie. Five  Stars.
0553212737|3.0|Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length  books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is  pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as  a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later  learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In  all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that  the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a  modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read  &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is  memorable as the embodiement of reason. Harriet is fine as the poor girl  caught in the middle. If you like this book, I suggest the movie with Kate  Beckingsale as Emma.
0792842723|5.0|\\"Goldeneye\\" is a fantastic movie. Another `James Bond' thriller. Pierce Brosnan stars in another `James Bond' movie. \\"Goldeneye\\" is also a great Nintendo 64 game. Five stars for a great action movie.
0345363132|5.0|As with all of Ms. Penman's books, this one kept me spellbound.  I've read it at least a half dozen times, and it is always as good as it was the first time.  Finally, someone has written a book that portrays Richard III in a positive light instead of as a murdering, hunchbacked villain.  Her  theories are researched and not pulled from thin air, making her ideas  about Richard's life believable.  Even more amazing is the author's  dedication to telling her story.  The original, completed manuscript was  stolen from her car, yet she was determined to tell Richard's tale, and she  rewrote the entire, HUGE novel. That feat is nothing short of amazing, and  serves to inspire me whenever I whine about rewriting something as short as  a three page scene.  An excellent novel by an outstanding author.  I highly  recommend this book to anyone.  I've given it to several people who don't  even like the time period, but it is so well written and enjoyable, that  they loved it anyway.  Read this book--you won't be sorry!
B00000K31Q|4.0|Of all the teen comedies that came out in 1999 (and there were many), this is easily the best written and acted. Taking its main plot from Shakespeare's &quot;Taming of the Shrew,&quot; the storyline is nothing  new. Neither does it have anything truly remarkable to say about the plight  of teenagers at the end of the century. But then, not all movies have to  have a message.  Passing on entertainment value alone, which this one does  winningly, can often be enough.<br />The cast is very likable, from the leads  through several of the supporting players (comedian Larry Miller gives a  splendidly dry performance), and the script is funny enough to keep one's  attention throughout.<br />It's no &quot;Fasttimes At Ridgemont High,&quot; or  even &quot;Clueless,&quot; but then, it doesn't make itself out to be. It's  a fun film with a storyline that's lasted from Elizabethean times.
B000022TSF|5.0|In case you haven't seen the film or read the 56 reviews of &quot;Chinatown&quot; preceding mine, I'll sum up briefly: Jack is a late-1930's ex-L.A. cop and private eye whose &quot;metier&quot; is  &quot;marital work.&quot;  He is embarassed when the results of a marital   stakeout are leaked and used to smear a wealthy and otherwise uncorrupt  public official, ultimately to further the interests of one or more real  estate developers and/or water moguls.  Jack suspects that he is at the  center of a setup, and is confronted by Faye, the public official's  beautiful, long-suffering wife.  Who is behind the setup?  Why?  Jack and  Faye atttempt to solve this &quot;mystery&quot; together.  Faye hires Jack.  Except, to Faye, the answers to these questions were never really a  &quot;mystery&quot;...  Or were they?  Even though we get a general idea of  the answers to our questions, not all of the ends tie up neatly.  (Exactly  what was the &quot;Albacore Club?&quot;  Didn't Hollis Mulwray make an  unusual choice of mistress? Why her?)           <br />This is a mystery in  which apparent answers only lead to more questions.       <br />The film is  artfully and stylishly done.  The beauty is in the detail. Color, costumes,  cars,  and set designs are exquisite.  Although many reviewers seem to  consider it a noir classic, most scenes are day, with many sunny exterior  shots, which belie the darkness of the subject matter.     <br />Beauty is  also seen in unique directorial and script touches.  We view the film  knowing no more than  Jack, the investigating private eye, and feel the  same frustrations.  He is not glamorous but he is certainly likeable  enough, and is intended for audience identification. He is not suave and  dashing. Although Jack is not usually a bungler, the ordinary &quot;little  people&quot; upon whom private eyes rely for the most important  information, are as unhelpful as can be.  So he encounters rudeness and  difficulty at every turn from everyday people: bureaucrats, secretaries,  barbershop customers, the snooty clerk at the hall of records, his  ex-colleagues in the police, and from a concierge at a rest home.  Faye's  patrician father purposely refuses to dignify Jack by pronouncing his last  name correctly. After almost drowning and getting soaked by a unexpected  gush from a storm sewer, he is unglamorously maimed by a pint-sized thug.   As a result, he must wear a bandage on his face through most of the film.   (I have never, before or since, seen a leading man in a movie with a  prominent bandage or scar on his face through most of a film.  Usually, the  bandage only stays for one scene.  Right?)  Later, Jack trespasses into an  orange grove in the course of his investigation.  The poor landowners, who  are also touched by the scandal, incorrectly assume that Jack is the root  of their problem, rather than their solution, and they severely beat him.   It seems that nothing goes right for him. <br />The film exposes a range human  flaws and weaknesses, too, which also adds realism to the story.  One of  the otherwise healthy-looking young men in orange grove needs a crutch to  walk.  Adultery is exposed, from the humiliation of a cuckolded immigrant  fisherman, and his wife's resulting black eye, to upper-class Faye's  surprising nonchalance about her husband's relationship. Corruption.  Greed  and slander. Violence. An obvious come-on line.<br />For people who like  Nicholson, it is a first-rate, and generally low-key performance, by his  standards, although he resorts to his fists.  Faye was and remains a  ravishing beauty.  Likewise, her acting is standout. <br />If you need happy  endings, this isn't the film for you.  Although it's a mystery, the movie  holds up well after repeat viewings.  There is a lot of plot to absorb on  the first viewing. This may explain the difficulty some reviewers have with  this film.
0440178002|5.0|Once a year, I find myself re-reading this book. Each time I pick it up, I enjoy re-living the epic tale that we are taken on. Critics discuss the lentgh of the book, but the story is told through the careful selection of words. Clavel paints a perfect picture of the Shogun and European  Exploration eras.<br />This book is a must read for anyone who is a history  buff, or a lover of Japanese culture. The book is equally enjoyable for all  - it has a tremendous amount of action and suspense, while it meanders  through romances and love triangles.<br />Pick this book up, and read about an  exciting part of history - where one wrong word can cost you your head!
B00000JZC4|5.0|When Richard Patrick said this before the band played &quot;Take A Picture&quot; at a recent concert I was at, he couldn't have been more correct.  Yes, it's odd to hear Filter now on Top 40 radio, but hopefully  more bands will begin competing with the fake singers and boy groups  clogging the airwaves and charts today.  This record is much better and  seems to have more of a purpose than the industrial SHORT BUS.   &quot;Welcome To The Fold,&quot; &quot;Take A Picture,&quot; &quot;The Best  Things, &quot; &quot;Skinny,&quot; and &quot;Cancer&quot; are just some of  the high points here.  All of the songs contain more than just lyrics of  alienation and hate, which shows the band is thinking of more than just  Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails now when making records.  This album is  enjoyable from start to finish, which can't really be said about SHORT BUS  in my opinion, and it shows Filter's growth in a huge way.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Prior to the creation of this album, Alanis Morissette took a trip to India, it's nobody's secret that this experience influenced in the writing of the lyrics. What can be seen as self-centered subjects, psycho babbling  and a melting pot of different spirituality tinted thoughts, can also be  seen totally differently.  This album is witness to the blooming of a  deep sense of spirituality in every aspect her life. A spirituality that  serves growth and understanding and that is never a way to brush pink paint  over darkness. Alanis explores ways to trigger empathy from listeners to  her life experiences. The fans that sought for this aspect of Alanis  writings in her first success album will be more than pleased by her second  opus, for she has the ability to movingly express things on a different  level.  On the flip side, FRONT ROW and THE COUCH reach a peak in  describing one's own life and are the most hermetic songs, being difficult  songs to universally relate to. UNSENT, who's subject are thoughts unsent  to lovers/friends, is particularly specific, but is surprisingly touching  because of the way it shows a love that goes beyond circumstances, a love  that is made of understanding and compassion. JOINING YOU is a real gem in  the way it deals with suicide, the songstress does not judge, but she makes  her point masterfully and powerfully. The other songs are all interesting  in their own way and makes up for an album that stands as a multi-faceted  entity.  As for the music, be prepared to hear more electronic sounds  and beats, which could be qualified as trip-hop. Not much change on the  side of the way she sings though, one hopes she won't get stuck like  Dolores (the Cranberries) and will explore more ways of rendering her  songs. But who can criticize that point in the face of such powerful  lyrics?
6305807086|5.0|Obviously the only point of this movie is to make you think, &quot;What was the point of this movie?&quot;  This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and kids, I've seen all the funny movies.  It runs up there  with being as weird and funny as &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;, &quot;Fear  and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, and &quot;Big Lebowski&quot;.  If there is  any allegories in the movie, I missed it, because of laughing so hard.  This is a must buy movie, you'll thank me later.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|This was easily one of the most highly anticipated records of 99 but also, for me, the biggest dissapointment.  I love Rage and greedily snapped up both &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Evil Empire&quot; on  their release dates.  Morello, the pioneering inventor of a movement that  really hasn't started yet has lost the brilliance of 96's &quot;Evil  Empire&quot;.  The distorted power chords are the same I might expect to  hear on a third eye blind record.  The politics are trite and wore out  (Mumia, we've herad it before).  &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; is Rage  attempting to pull off a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion song, to little  effect.  However, this album does have some wonderful songs on it like the  old meets new school rap of &quot;Mic Check&quot; and the feverent whir of  &quot;Maria&quot; which seems almost out of place but would fit nicely into  Evil Empire.  Either way, if you are a fan of Rage you already own this  album.  If not, go buy &quot;Evil Empire&quot; and become a fan of Rage.   Then buy this one.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Nothing is quite so productive of irony as the collision of art and commerce, and this sterling CD is a perfect example. The year is 1964, and the (white) owners of Chess Records are concerned that Chicago-style  electrified blues is being usurped in the marketplace by &quot;folk  music&quot;--everything, that is, from the Weavers to the rediscovered  Mississippi John Hurt. So they importune the great Muddy Waters to trim his  sails to the commerical breeze and cut a &quot;folk&quot; session with an  acoustic guitar. Sell out? Nothing of the kind. Muddy, needless to say,  came up via the Delta string-band tradition to start with, so unplugging  was hardly a stretch for him. And the result was, and is, a stripped-down  wonder, with the singer's bottomless, resonant baritone front and center,  supported by his own expert fingerpicking, Willie Dixon's upright bass, and  an extremely youthful Buddy Guy supplying electric fills. Fantastic, just  fantastic, with one of Muddy's all-time greatest performances, &quot;You  Can't Lose What You Never Had.&quot;
6302610702|5.0|of the trilogy, my personal favorite is the second one. we get to see young vito's humble (and violent)beginnings in sicily, his journey to ellis island, and his rise in new york city as  a young man. i love this movie  because it deals with family loyalties. one of the BEST scenes i have ever  seen (and pacino at his finest)is (without giving it away) michael corleone  and his brother fredo in cuba. these movies are american masterpieces.
6304493681|5.0|This anime has by far the best animation and art work ever. It takes an extremely close second to Akira. But unlike Akira, every character has its own look (I dunno about you, but it got hard to tell between characters in  Akira). Sound is incredible in this anime. While sound usually never takes  a major role in Japanimation, Ghost in the Shell proves it does. There is  only one thing wrong with the movie...plot...now don't get me wrong, the  plot is by far one of the most intellectual and genius plots you could ever  imagine, but few will only understand it if you have read the manga. I  unfortunately did not, so like Mission: Impossible (a movie you had to see  like 3 times to understand everything) Ghost in the Shell has to be watched  more than once to let everything sink in. My 3rd time watching it, I  understood it and appreciated its genius and cleverness...This will be a  classic for generations along with Akira and Ninja Scroll. I highly  recommend this anime if you want action and well thought out plot. Both  subtitled and dubbed are excellent, I recommend both of them.
B000005B0U|5.0|i love this CD!  with all those stars contributing to the movie and the CD is sold me on it. for those of you that haven't seen the movie yet, go rent it. i reccommend seeing the police chase scene over and over again!
B00000420F|5.0|Bartoli should really receive all the credit here for bringing these songs to life.  It isn't just the beautiful vocal tone that impresses, but her probing interpretation into the meaning these songs have.  It is almost as  if I have to stop my cd player after each song just to digest what I have  just heard because there is so much emotion, drama, and dynamic intensity  througout.  My favorites are &quot;Caro mio ben&quot; (which is easily  butchered, but sounds so fresh in Bartoli's hands) and &quot;Gia sole dal  Gange&quot; to name just a couple.  I like most everything Bartoli has  done, but this is a very special disc.
B000009ED0|1.0|&quot;Rap-metal&quot;. Isn't that an oxymoron? Of course it is, yet many of the so-called rock bands around today fit that description. Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock, being the most obvious offendors. Trash like this  album simply do not belong in the rock section at music stores, it is an  insult to good music. The only reasons kids are buying this album like  hotcakes is because a)the antichrist known as eMpTVy told them to b)because  it has &quot;cuss words&quot; in it, that makes them feel like they are  rebelling (listen to real heavy metal with language instead, Pantera, for  example), and c)because it's played endlessly on the radio. Bawitdaba, what  the hell is that? Lyrics in music used to mean something. Kids should stop  listening to trash like this and read some lyrics by real rock poets such  as Roger Waters and Neil Peart, and while they're at it, they should chance  a listen at some of the few good bands left today such as Dream Theater and  Gov't Mule.

0780622553|5.0|Let me start off by saying this is a brilliant DvD, the picture and sound quality rock and the extras are incredible. If you're a movie freak like me you'll love the commentary on this one, it explains a lot you miss out on  while watching the movie.<br />Which brings me to the most important advice on  this movie. *SKIP* the pre title intro. In it Kiefer Sutherland explains  some stuff about the movie you do not want to know. Just skip to the titles  (just turn the volume down until they start, and turn it up fast if you see  a guy in a bathtub, that's where the real movie starts). I have no clue why  they put that intro in but it will ruin the best part of the movie's  experience. <br />The first time I saw this movie I got distracted during the  intro so I missed it, boy was I glad. This movie is what the matrix so  desperately tries to be, a true dark gothic representation of a possible  reality. Now I'm not saying the matrix is  bad, just that the matrix is an  action movie and this one more a psychological Sci-Fi, it's a lot more  intelligent.<br />If you like movies that drag you into another reality, one  where you can only cling on to shards of explanations of what is happening,  you'll like this one. You can't help being dragged along in the main  character's oblivion, simply because you yourself know nothing more than he  does for the first part of the movie (unless ofcourse you were foolish  enough to watch the intro).<br />The only thing I am willing to say about the  movie itself is that it's about a man waking up in a bathtub, having no  clue whatsoever about what is going on, or what &quot;is&quot; at all, for  that matter.<br />Watch this one, you won't be disappointed, it's one of my  favourite DvD's.
0780625129|4.0|I thought this would probably be another &quot;perfect world&quot; movie filled w/ liberal propaganda, but, rather, it simply gave us a look into the nature &amp; reality of hatred.  I still think a lot of this is blown out of preporsion regarding all of the racial hatred.  I just don't buy it <br />Edward  Norton is incredible, just as he was in Primal Fear; I think this is one of  the most powerful acting jobs in recent memory.  And I agree, the b&amp;w  shot of him proceeding his murders is one I won't ever forget.<br />I could  have gone w/ a little less moral at the end, but overall this is an  excellent film.
0312853238|5.0|I recently moved from fantasy to sci-fi, and my friend recommended Ender's Game. In a word, wow. This book kept me reading for hours and hours. I think the best aspect of Card's writing is that he creates characters with personalities so deep that they create their own plot. I would highly  recommend this book to...anyone! If you liked the book, I would definitely  suggest Ray Bradbury, or you can go where I came from: Tolkien, Terry  Brooks, Raymond E. Feist, and all those great fantasy writers. This is  definitely a classic.

B000001GPX|5.0|This CD, which is part of the  Deutsche Grammophon &quot;Originals&quot; series, is a digital re-mastering of performances of Beethoven's 5th and 7th symphonies, originally recorded in 1975 and 1976.  I share with other  reviewers the opinion that these performances are in a class by themselves.  For sheer passion, poetic expression, precision and lyricism, they have no  peer.  From opening to closing measure of  the 5th symphony,  Carlos  Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra play with an intensity that  is almost palpable, an intensity which gives way to exquisite lyric beauty  in the slow movement.  The 7th symphony, which has been described as the  &quot;apotheosis of the dance,&quot; is no less brilliant.  These are the  definitive performances of Beethoven's 5th and 7th symphonies; this CD  should be on the shelf of every serious collector of Beethoven's music.
6304508611|5.0|Carrie is one of the most enjoyable horrors around. The movie mixes terror with emotion in a way that ultimately keeps you gripped until the end. And the end finale is breath-taking. Excellent movie!
B000001G6W|5.0|When I purchased my very first classical music compact disc (CD) in 1987, it was this 1977 recording of  Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 &#34;Choral,&#34; performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Herbert von Karajan. To this day, it has remained my all-time favorite rendition of Beethoven's Ninth. I think this particular performance has few, if any peers, from the standpoint of warmth, passion,  and vitality.  The third movement - adagio molto e cantibile - is  my personal favorite, with its incomparably ethereal quality that's unsurpassed on any recording of this magnificent symphony that I've heard since.  The choral singing in the fourth movement  is excellent,  even though I don't think it quite matches the majesty and passion  of the 1994 recording by John Eliot Gardiner, the Monteverdi Choir and soloists, and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et  Romantique. As with all Deutsche  Grammophon recordings, the sound quality is quite outstanding.  This  venerable recording is, in my view, one of the finest versions of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony currently available on CD.

B00000IL1K|5.0|Sarah Brightman proves once again that she is a great singer. This follow-up Cd from Time to say Good-bye will not show her power as a singer though. This Album will be more of a Cd you could listen to, to relax and  lift your spirts. Her read on My heart will go on surpasses that of Celine  Dion. Nessun Dorma was amazingly done ( this was the first time I heard a  soprano sing this tenor aria) and well as Track 6 and 3. This CD exceeding  all my expectations and will make you looking forward to Sarah's New CD  Luna.  With her beautiful voice and constant training she will be able to  surpass all the opera critics. This Cd is a must buy for all those that  think that Church ( the 16 year old ) can be compared to Sarah Brightman to  prove themselves wrong. I dont think there will ever be a singer that will  be able to acomplish what Sarah Brightman has....vocal power...vocal  verastility....and yet have the voice of an angel..not even Callas was able  to achive that.
B000002B7W|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite CDs! Listening to Randy play the stick sends chills down my spine. This album far surpasses &quot;Live and  Loud.&quot; &quot;Crazy Train&quot; sounds much better on this album than  on the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; album. Randys' guitar solo on  &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; is the bomb! This CD is a masterpiece and one  of Ozzys' best albums and if you are a die-hard Ozzy fan, you must have  this CD in your collection! This CD is worth every penny I spent on it!
B00000INEX|5.0|The &quot;Baby Bach&quot; video was given to my son as agift. He is 2 years old and was adopted internationally. I cannotexpress how much he loves these videos (after the success we had withthe first, I have since purchased them all) He watches at least one a day. They have been a great teaching tool for us to help develop his language. The videos are fun and relaxing. I have to admit I even enjoy watching them with my son.
B000001FY5|5.0|One day,I found EXODUS in my house.It was my mom's  old CD.I herd wonderful music come out.I think it's some of the best music in the world.I reccomend it for all ages.
B00004SVID|5.0|ISAOT, a 20 year old live recording, is nothing short of fantastic. Much credit must go to the band, and to those involved with production.  It sounds better than quite a few more &quot;modern&quot; CD's    I strongly  suggest picking up the limited edition with the 60+ page book.  If you like  Pink Floyd, you're in for a real treat!
B000002J23|4.0|Drama remains possibly my favorite of Yes' albums-there's a metallic, futuristic energy here lacking from their previous one, Tormato. History has dismissd the album, wrongfully so, I must add- Geoffrey  Downes(replacing Wakeman)has a tasteful, modern sound which never  overkilled for the sake of it, unlike with Wakeman, who often just didn't  know what to stick into a song other than more classical noodling. Witness  his own textures in 'White Car' and 'Tempus Fugit'. His style was more  looking ahead than regurgitating mellotron sounds of the past. Drama is one  of the most Steve Howe-heavy Yes albums as well- no Wakeman solos or  Anderson fairy-slop to slow him down this time. His solos on 'Run Through  The Light' are among his best ever. No joke. Squire and White's rhythm  section is tighter than ever here, but the real treat here in my opinion  was Trevor Horn. Sure, he wasn't Anderson, but that's the point of getting  a new singer- to add a different element that wasn't there before, even if  it means replacing what was there before. Come on- would some hippy  Anderson wannabe replacement really have been acceptable? Horn's  contributions on Drama were strong. His image(a suit &amp; tie and large  glasses, somewhat of a New Wave elton john)were different, taking Yes into  a more down to earth realm, while still retaining their instrumental  mastery. Had the fans and the companies not been close-minded about the  Drama era Yes, the next album probably would have been big, like the first  Asia album and 90125 rolled into one. Don't ignore this album!  It's the  freshest sounding thing they've done- the band were coming out of a dark  period(the ill-fated aborted Paris sessions album which never got  released)and were ready for the 80's. The band were revved up and the music  reflects it. No Anderson cosmic hippy preaching on this album(a BIG problem  with Yes these days), just solid Yes music that could have went somewhere  had people of the time given it an honest listen instead of resisting  change and being left by the wayside when time rolled away from a lot of  the 'Fragile-and-nothing-else' Yes fans of the 70's. A high energy,  gleaming metal alloy album not to be dismissed. Only flaw is that it seems  short, but a lot of albums from that era were. Click on your Amazon and  grab it today! I never get tired of this one.
B000000SDB|5.0|Harnoncourt sees the Beethoven symphonies from the XVIII Century onwards, rather than from Bruckner backwards. The gain is obvious: clearer string lines, woodwinds and brass far better balanced (remember that Toscanini  used to double them and what a mess they made). The playing of the Chamber  Orchestra of Europe is of the highest order, they easily match the BPO or  the VPO in their finest days. Harnoncourt is very consistent through out,  there are no &quot;weak&quot; movements in any symphony, let alone a whole  symphony that is less than excellent. Please disregard the Gramophone  recommendation which would like you to believe that Sir Colin Davis recent  Staatskapelle cycle in Philips is the best digital version, of course it's  not. Davis is no longer the exciting conductor he was in the 60's, now  Harnoncourt leads the way into Beethoven's sound world. By the way, if you  want to complement Harnoncourt's vision try to add to your collection Jordi  Savall's fiery &quot;Eroica&quot; in Auvidis and Herreweghe's Ninth  Symphony in Harmonia Mundi.
044022425X|1.0|While reading this book I could hear the author straining in the background.  Better throw in a rape, a bear, an indian attack, a storm. The melodrama was over the top. These piled on events were interspersed with long boring stretches like where Claire grows penicillin or describes the  mountain.  At one point I stopped reading to count the adjectives.  You can  skip 20 pagers at a clip and miss nothing. I won't be reading another.
B000001G6W|5.0|When Karajan developed &quot;his&quot; sound from the BPO, it was obvious that it would suit some composers better than others. That gorgeous velvet sound proved ideal for Strauss and Bruckner, but Mozart and Haydn suffered  and to some degree so did Beethoven, who needs clearer sharper lines. But  the Ninth is perhaps the one Beethoven symphony who can take the Karajan  sound without loss of clarity. I always thought this is one of the finest  Beethoven symphonies recorded by Karajan, big boned but spiritual, with a  drop-dead gorgeous vocal quartet, the finest ever perhaps. This is  certainly a better recording than the 1963 version, and far better than the  1984 digital remake when he was at odds with BPO over Sabine Meyer, sad  years for Karajan and his great orchestra. This is one of the Ninths to be  had.
0684833395|5.0|I have to say that of all the fiction books I have read, this is quite probably the best.  The quirky logic and pacifist bias appeals to my sense of humour very much.  This, combined with the strong feel of madness and nonsense, combines to make a literary work of art.  The theme of madness  can be well illustrated by Milo's (the fictional mess officer) syndicate,  which seems to make a profit while somehow taking terrible losses.   I must  object to M. Besselink's view, although we are all entitled to our own  opinions, but I think that this is a novel that cannot be read if you are  not ready for it.  Many people will dismiss it as ridiculous and  over-complicated - they ought not to read it, as such genius should not be  scorned.  A must read on the basis that it is a modern literary classic,  and will remain so as long as we retain the military and armed conflicts  exist.
B0000060AK|4.0|Next to Giulio Cesare, Alcina and Orlando, Ariodante is one of Handel's finest operas. The music is exquisite and the plot is nos as silly as in other Baroque operas. We have 2 very desirable recordings of Ariodante&gt;  this one and a slightly older one in Harmonia Mundi which won a Gramophone  Award for best Baroque Vocal recording. The main drawback of the Archiv  recording is Minkowski's nervous conducting, sometimes it's just too fast  for its own good (and the singers). Anne-Sofie von Otter sings mostly very  well, but I think Lorraine Hunt has an even better sense of style and a  voice just as good. The main advantage of the Archiv over the HM is the  Ginevra of Lynne Dawson, marvelous performance. But HM has a better  orchestra in the Freiburger Barockorchester, one of the choicest period  bands around. Both recordings are good and I certainly would want both, but  if forced to choose, the McGegan is the more natural and beautiful  Ariodante to be had.
0783235380|1.0|Totally exaggerated humor.  Bullock, as always, is very pleasing to look at.  However, her acting and plot in this film are dependent upon the extent that the viewer is willing to believe in a world without values.   Who knows, if they keep making movies like this, the world will soon have  no values.  Boring and not original!  What a waste of money.
B000002GK1|5.0|If you like the unique Soundgarden sound then this album is for you, each track being a classic in is own right.  This once again confirms Soundgarden as one of the most inventive and talented bands of the 90s. A  must buy!
0064471837|5.0|I first read this book in 5th grade, I believe. I remember reading it then, and thought it was the best book &quot;in the whole world!&quot; Just the other day, I was at a bookstore, and I was looking for fantasy books. I came across this book again, and remembered thinking how great it was. I bought it, and spent exactly 2 1/2 days reading it. Basically, I ate,  drank, slept and breathed Sabriel. I just swallowed it up!  Now, I am in  7th grade, about to graduate, and I STILL love it! It is sooooo wonderful!  I reccomend anyone who thinks they can take the challenge of reading this  complicated, but fun, book. The only things you need are time,  concentration, a comfortable chair and peace and quiet!
0399111719|5.0|I love just about everything Georgette Heyer's written in the Regency genre, but this book is the best of an excellent crop. Venetia is a delightful heroine, mature and intelligent while at the same time extremely  naive about men and the ways of the world - so much so that she has  absolutely no notion just how much danger her new next-door neighbour, the  wicked Lord Damerel, could be to her. And yet it is her innocence which is  her greatest protection where he is concerned.<br />Their growing friendship,  assisted by Venetia's young brother, and the interference of Venetia's  other suitors, is portrayed with humour and a light touch by Heyer. But  once he decides that he cannot in all conscience seduce her, Damerel  believes himself to be unworthy of her. Even when she needs him most, he  appears to turn his back on her.<br />Of course, being a Heyer book, all works  out in the end, but the journey to that denoument is alternately witty,  sparkling and heart-wrenching. <br />Like most Heyers, this book is now out of  print; however you manage to get a copy, keep it! This is a book you'll  want to read over and over.
B00000IPAX|2.0|Sellin out isnt always cool, but blink did on this album. At first, i defended their butts, but now it shows through. Blink is a great band with wonderful talent. But they didnt have to change their music just to make  people like them.<br />Go out and buy Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch. ull see how  they changed. Blink is still the best but they need &quot;time to sow all  the bridges that they burned&quot;
630476524X|5.0|I liked this movie better than the first one because it made me want to see the people who killed ashe and his son die. It almost made me cry. I guess the way that they killed a 5 year old boy made me more mad than  seeing them kill two grown up people.
0780622545|3.0|I know it doesn't really come under horror, but some of the scenes were quite creepy and suspenseful.  It's tense all the way through, but the best part of the movie is the very beginning.  The film starts to get a bit  confusing later on though, but still a good watch.  3 or 3 1/2 stars.
B00000064G|5.0|Nick Drake's music, words, and lyrics will capture your heart from the first chord of &quot;Pink Moon&quot; that you hear.  For the next half an hour you get a collection of 11 songs with the bare acoustic guitar that he  used to write his songs from in his orange chair and his deep voice that  sounds as if he were singing next to you at a campfire.  It is a well worth  buy to get Pink Moon which is a blend of the character and guitar of Cat  Stevens with the immaculous rhyme sequences of Dylan, voice that is its own  instrument like Dave Matthews, and the deep message of your most trusted  friend.<br />There is much debate now whether the VW commercial gives him  justice, or exploits his soul to indrustrialization.  True, those who have  been his followers since his untimely death may not care for his sudden  spruge of popularity, but rather think of when you first heard him... and  now he is being heard by more and more.  The VW commerical was originally  going to run the music of the Church's &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot;,  until someone from the office brought in this CD.  It was changed at the  last minute to accomodate Nick Drake's &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, as your CD  player will undoubtedly do also.
B000002JSZ|5.0|The sound is raw, almost like it was recorded in a basement and the only way to hear it good on tape was to scream and play really loud!  &quot;Rising Power&quot; is a great opener, which almost sounds like  &quot;Nervous Shakedown&quot; except faster.  &quot;Flick of the  Switch&quot;, as with most AC/DC title tracks is a hard cruncher.  My  personal favorite, &quot;Landslide&quot; has that building momentum, just  like its name.  The other tracks are hard, but like I said before, with  that basement sound to them.  An overlooked album-but a real winner.
1573225517|4.0|Good airplane reading for any single person who pours all of his or  her energy into an obsession that the rest of society thinks is  stupid. In Rob Fleming's case, the obsession is music. He and his  friends won't talk to anyone who owns fewer than 500 records,  who owns  a Tracy Chapman or Beatles CD, or &quot;who goes  'Woooh!' to the  fade-out of 'Brown Sugar.'&quot; His girlfriend Laura  grills him:  &quot;There is no greater crime than that, as far as you're  concerned,  is there?&quot; There isn't, for Rob, just as my friends get  apoplectic talking to anyone who thinks Bill Gates or Microsoft  invented anything.
B000002JS6|5.0|These were the good old days for AC/DC.  Back when Brian Johnson's voice was a crisp scream and the band played with amazing energy!  Every song on here is fantastic, there's not much more to say.  Hey, the band is still  great--but the days of  energy and crisp voices have come and gone very  quickly.
0790733226|4.0|I continually find myself watching this dvd over and over... certainly Sagan's tale is a good yarn with excellent movement of the plot.... and Foster again acts with wonderful depth... and the effects integrate well...  but most of all it leaves us asking questions about ourselves, who we are,  how we define ourselves, we take askance at our failings and our  shortcomings... the movie will move you while engaging your thoughts well  after it is done.

B0000025WQ|5.0|&quot;She's So Unusual&quot; is the greatest one-shot album in rock history. Cyndi proved herself subsequently to be a rather minor talent. But, man, did she put it together for this album. &quot;Money Changes  Everything&quot; is a startling opener, and the rest of side 1 offers a  stunning variety of universally excellent material. Side 2 (am I dating  myself?) might not be QUITE as amazing, but &quot;Girls Just ...&quot; (you  know the rest) is one song I will absolutely never get tired of. A shame  that Cyndi degenerated into a fatal combination of self-importance and  self-parody, but for one shining moment, she was QUEEN FOR A DAY.
B00000IPAX|5.0|BLINK 182 IS THE BEST PUNK BAND EVER...THERE SO UNIQUE..AND I LOVE &quot;ALL THE SMALL THINGS&quot; THAT SONG REALLY INSPIRES ME TO WRITE MUSIC..AND BLINK 182 IS KEEPING THE PUNK SCENE UNDEAD..YOU GUYS  RULE..PEACE!
B000000W5L|5.0|Yes, it's their best. Lotsa competition, starting with Beggars Banquet (heck, every 60's studio album is a must-own), but this one has them looking up, down, in &amp; out at the world with their clearest vision  ever. Looking deeper inside, as well, often painfully -- this album seems  to have taken a huge chunk out of the band. They went into a steep decline  immediately after, emerging only periodically with music that stands with  their best. But what a moment while it lasted!
B000002MG1|4.0|Several years ago I saw the video for REM's songs Everybody Hurts and Man on the Moon.  I was so taken by the depth and power of these songs that I bought this album; I was definately not disappointed.  Though those two  above-mentioned recordings may be considered the standouts, there isn't a  bad song on the CD.  Every song tells a story and has a very deep,  sympathetic and (often) jovial sound that will make this music appeal to  almost anyone.  Definately worth a look (or a listen).  Check it out, and  enjoy!
B000002KIE|5.0|By what we now consider albums, this isn't -- it's a collection of singles. But what singles!  Let's remember the radio in 1977: Eagles, America, disco, ad nauseum, and also remember how revolutionary the Pistols  sounded then. They didn't SOUND dangerous, they WERE dangerous. Destined,  inevitably, to explode inside of a year, but what a great one-shot! For  clearing one's head, cranking &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot; full blast on  the headphones is better than primal scream therapy could ever hope to be.
630575067X|4.0|I thought Episode I was very entertaining and fun to watch.  I love Jar-Jar!  The technical expertise is amazing.  The characters aren't quite as engaging as Luke, Han, and Leia -- but this is a movie I can watch over  and over.

B000002OX5|5.0|This is The Who's best album. Totally unique.  Never heard anything like it.  Masterpiece.
6305800073|3.0|but their is something that doesn't ring true about the film.They're supposed to be a bunch of hicks(rustics if you prefer) but they sit around listening to X and Roky Erickson.Wouldn't they be jamming to Billy Ray  Cyrus and Skid Row out in the boondocks in'93?I only point it out because  it is indicative of the only flaw with this film but a major one I felt.  That this film was made by New York art dweebs that idealize what it is to  be white trash. On the whole the film was a lot more engrossing then I  thought it would be.
B000002UAI|5.0|I should subtract a star just for &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot;, the worst thing they ever sung (good thing they didn't write it), but thats my only complaint.  It doesn't warrant a full star less.  But the rest is awesome.   The songs they wrote seem to be very depressing, while the covers (except  Mr. Moonlight of course) are great classic rock n' roll.

B000023VR6|5.0|What can be said about Dre's first LP in eight years? For one, he is still the bomb. His sound engineering and hip-hop harmonies are still some of the  best the world has to offer. His guests are top quality--Snoop, Eminem,  Xzibit, etc.--and the rhymes are still written well. Sure, it took eight  years, but a lot of things happened in Dre's life in that span of time.  Thus, we arrive at the part of the new record which exceeds the original  Chronic the most: emotion. The old Dre was hell-bent on partying,  gangbanging, and mocking people like EZ. This time around, Dre looks to  make amends (&quot;Still D-R-E&quot;), send a shot out to his departed  brother Tyree (&quot;The Message&quot;), and prove that he's still got the  fire (&quot;Forgot About Dre&quot;). It all boils down to success. Dre has  the best of both worlds now. And he no longer has to risk his life and lose  friends to attain it. And &quot;The Chronic 2001&quot; is a testament to  that. Welcome back, Dre.
6305126062|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie ever made! Trust me it will bore you to tears. I went to see this in the theater, and after it was done I felt I had lost 3 days of my life(I'm not kidding thats how boring it is) I dont  recomend this.
B000001Y42|5.0|Limp Bizkit saw an early sign of a new trend in music beginning to surface. They took it and ran with it. And damn, did they run far. Hip-hop and metal didn't naturally go hand-in-hand a few years ago, but now we  readily accept the combination thanks to a wave of innovative bands  spear-headed by Limp Bizkit. Three Dollar Bill Y'All is their masterpiece:  complete with the rage-infected songs &quot;Counterfeit&quot; &amp;  &quot;Pollution&quot; and the brilliantly butchered cover of George  Michael's &quot;Faith&quot;. They had to have known early on that their  style would eventually catch fire. It has now, and this is the album that  led the way. If you don't own it, make sure that you do soon.
6300215717|5.0|I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but I'll have to say Roman Holiday is the only film in that catergory I liked. It is audrey Hepburn's greatest performance, and it is easily one of the best films of all time.
0061003697|5.0|This is a Fine Christie work.The Characters are  top of the line.The setting on the Karnac is awesome.You wont want to miss this one.The only problem is the murder is on page 140.Other than that it is one of my  favorites.
B00003CXA2|5.0|There hasnt been too many movies like Forrest Gump, and I guess thats what makes this movie so special. It goes along side films like Braveheart and The Green Mile as one of the greatest films of the 90's. A must see.
B00000DFRS|5.0|i loved this cd it is awesome i especially liked my love is your love and its not right but its okay
079213690X|5.0|The 1990's brought us a lot of great films: Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, ect. But Braveheart is unmistakely the greatest film of the 90's, it is the best film since The Godfather Part II. If you  like historic epics you will love Braveheart!
B00000JTB2|4.0|Stevie Ray Vaughn often cited Albert King as one of his primary influences.  King's tone, passion, and fleet-fingered style all wove their way into Stevie's approach to guitar, but &quot;In Session&quot; shows that  there was much MUTUAL admiration between these two guitar heroes.  King  generously allows Stevie to take the majority of the solos, and one can  picture him standing back in the studio, watching Stevie in awe.  While  this recording is neither man's best work, it's a vital document because it  captures them together just JAMMING for fun.  It's the blues equivalent of  Jerry Garcia's and David Grisman's &quot;Shady Grove&quot; release --  conversations, missteps, bum notes, and a raw underproduced sound are just  as entertaining and inspired as the searing guitar work and soulful vocals.   A must for any fan.  This might be my favorite posthumous Stevie release.
630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady is a great film and it had some great songs.Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn give great performances in what has to be the greatest movie musical of all time. It is Far better than The Sound of Music
B0000028RR|5.0|This CD is far better than Korn or Limp Bizkit, as it is an excellent combination of outstanding music and revolutionary lyrics. This CD, and &quot;Evil Empire&quot; and &quot;Battle of Los Angeles,&quot; is well  worth your money.
6303407188|5.0|This is a great movie about the worst director of all time. Martin Landau won best supporting actor of 1994 for his portral of Bella Lagosi. I highly recomend this great biopic.
6305810109|5.0|Admittedly, the fact that I look with favor on any film that doesn't portray Iowans as hicks may slightly taint my review. But what David Lynch has created with this film is something truly moving and timeless, the  likes of which hasn't been seen in a LONG time, even during last year which  was a phenomenal year for great movies. If someone had told me that the  best films of 1999 would be about a puppeteer who travels inside the mind  of John Malkovich and an elderly man who rides 300 miles on a lawnmower, I  would have been cautious of anything arriving in theaters. Against the  odds, however, both films proved to be masterpieces, even if they didn't  walk away with any Academy Awards (like we need to give any credence to  that particular institution).  This brings me to what I felt was one of the  biggest travesties in Oscar history.  Academy voters could have done all  the right things by awarding Richard Farnsworth (calling attention to an  overlooked film, awarding the oldest actor ever to be nominated for Best  Actor, capping the career of a great character actor who's been working in  the business for over half a century, and, most importantly, by giving the  award to the most deserving performance), but instead they gave it to Kevin  Spacey (who was excellent, but then again, he's always excellent) as part  of &quot;American Beauty&quot;'s Oscar sweep. Oh, well, those who see  &quot;The Straight Story&quot; know that Farnsworth's appearance truly  ranks among the greatest of all time. There is a scene in a bar where  Farnsworth (an actual WWII veteran)recounts a war story with another  veteran. The sadness behind his eyes conveys all the visual horror of the  D-Day sequence in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and it's the closest  I've ever come to actually crying in a movie (not counting when I was  little and Yoda died in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;). To costar with  Farnsworth in the first act of the movie, Lynch got Sissy Spacek, and her  moving turn as Alvin Straight's daughter was surely deserving of an Oscar  nomination (as was the score, cinematography, director, and the picture as  a whole), and she avoids all the cliches of playing a &quot;slow&quot;  individual. Her scenes with Farnsworth are absolutely priceless.  Is it  possible, therefore, for the movie to sustain itself once Farnsworth sets  out alone on the road?  Yes it is, thanks to beautiful aerial photography,  a score that alternates between vibrancy, tragedy, and sadness, and a  capable supporting cast. There is not a villain in the film, the closest of  which are two brothers who try to cheat Alvin on repairs to his lawn mower.   Alvin, however, sets them straight (no pun intended), and leaves them  better off, as he does to all the people he encounters. You may wonder why  I rave so much about a film that sounds so simple.  Well, you can describe  as much as you want with words, but it's not until you see all those  elements work together onscreen that you can fully appreciate just how  magical a work of film &quot;The Straight Story&quot; is.
6305546789|5.0|I'll have to say that Halloween was one of the greatest horror movies ever made, it is the film that spawned memorable horror series like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. This is a must see for any horror fan.
6305499403|5.0|Having spent so much time in cubical's all of my life, I could really relate to this film.  Jennifer Aniston could have easily been left out of this film, though.  Still, I give it five stars, and I think it is one of  the all time classic comedies.  I wonder why I never heard of this movie  when it came out in theaters?
B00000K31Q|3.0|1) Not bad. 2) Not as simpleminded as a Jennifer Love Huey Duey flick. 3) Cute 3rd Rock From The Sun casting. 4) Julia Stiles is very hot. 5) &quot;Seinfeld's&quot; evil-doorman was pretty funny as the dad. 6) Julia  Stiles has a nice voice. 7) Some parts were unrealistic-the detention scene  and the I LOVE YOU BABY rendition. 8) Julia Stiles has nice hair. 9) For a  teen-flick it was no FAST TIMES or PORKY's, but it will kill 100 minutes of  your life without too much regret. 10) Julia Stiles is cool.
B00000J7S8|5.0|What an incredible album - both musically and with its general appeal.  Talent has not been forgotten!  So unique among modern music, this album breaks all of the pop music rules by providing an artist you can write,  play, and perform her music.  The key to its sweet success is the seductive  jazz - so forgotten in our studio production world.  Ranging from the silky  &quot;When I look in Your Eyes&quot; to the snazzy jazzy &quot;I Can't Give  You Anything But Love&quot;, the songs on this album parallel the jazz  greats of yester-year, but spins it with a modern finger.  With her kool  kat piano and gutsy voice, Krall has listeners pushing play and saying  &quot;ahhhh.....&quot;
B00004RF8J|5.0|When you put together Rick Moranis,Steve Martin,a giant plant who feeds off human blood,and a fabulous rock music score,what do you get?  &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;,that's what!    Rick Moranis is  Seymour,an orphan who wants nothing more than to get out of his drab  town(&quot;Downtown&quot;)and find love with his co-worker,Audrey.(Ellen  Greene)However,that's not really possible while working in Skid Row at  Mushnik's Flower Shop.(Mr. Mushnik is played by Vincent  Gardenia)However,that all changes when Seymour discovers a strange plant  during a solar eclipse and christens it &quot;Audrey 2&quot;.Things pick up  at the flower shop when customers begin pouring in to see the plant-and  making poor Seymour's life a little more bearable.Until,that is,Seymour  discovers that his precious plant can only live on human blood.(&quot;Feed  Me&quot;)With nowhere to turn,Seymour must find a way to keep Audrey 2  alive,while getting Audrey 1 to fall in love with him.   Although Rick  Moranis and Ellen Greene are superb as Seymour and Audrey,the celeb cameos  sometimes steal the show.Steve Martin is perfect as the sadistic dentist  and Audrey's abusive boyfriend,Orin.His sole musical  number(&quot;Dentist!&quot;) is my personal favorite.Orin's hyperactive  masochistic patient is played by  Bill Murray in his prime.Some other  celebs pop up in the movie too,such as John Candy.   Levi Stubbs of the  Four Tops is the voice of Audrey 2,an excellent role with some showstopping  musical numbers.And last but definitely not least,three newcomers play  Ronnette,Chiffon,and Crystal,the Supremes-type singers known as the Doo  Wops.This cast and the script make it a perfect show.Enjoy!
B00000G3PA|1.0|Another stupid movie like Independance Day where the gratuitous action seems to attract a lot of people. What can be said about this Hollywood product ? First, you see that movie like you eat a hamburger at Mac-Donald  : another Bruce Willis movie, oh excuse-me i mean Big mac. Seriously, the  movie is very weak, when i see it i didn't understand anything. Bruce  Willis acts like he does in a lot of movie, that is to say like a true  American hero who wants to save the world. The &quot;plot&quot; itself is a  nonsense : a group of true stupid heroes want to save the world and destroy  a big rock coming to earth. Don't expect to see any scientific data in the  movie, there is only horrible acting, story, bad special effects.
B00000IONU|5.0|This is the type of music that causes car accidents!   The White Stripes have an energy and freshness which is astounding. Few albums are recorded with such vibrance and raw edge...pop it in your car's cd player and make  sure to wear your seatbelt.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a very suspensful book.  It is a great book forall ages.  I would reccommend The Giver to be put on a requiredreading list.  It will intrigue you from the very first page to thevery last. The author did a great job keeping the reader interested throughout the whole book.  The Giver is about a boy named Joanes.  He lives in an ideal world.  There is no pain, no worries, and no memories.  Each person is assigned a certain role and that role is carefully chosen and well thoughtout . Each member in the community has to work in that job until they enter the house of the dead.  When Joanes is twelve years old he is assigned the most important role in the community.  This role requires power, strength, and courage. This job also requires pain, and emotional feelings Joanes may not be ready for.  When Joanes receives his training the world in his eyes is now seen in a different perspective.  His world is no longer a perfect world.  Joanes now realizes all the things and choices he is misssing out on.  This explores human's desire to live life to the fullest whether there are good things like pleasure and happiness or bad memories like war, hate and death.  Joanes realizes he is no longer happy and decides to do something very drastic. This decision could deeply impact the society Joanes lives in.  After reading this book it made me think in an entirely different way.  I realized that even though I do not get to do whatever I want, I still have the freedom to make choices, and ultimately I can choose my own path. It helped me appreciate my world for what it is, and realize that in order to feel true happiness, sometimes it is necessary, as happened with Joanes, to feel pain, sadness, worry, and uncertainty.  This book is the first book I have read that touched me to this extent. I hope many other people read this and get to experience what I have experienced.
0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises was Hemingway's first full-length novel, and in it, he began to perfect the characteristics of what Philip Young would call the &quot;Hemingway hero.&quot;  Jake Barnes is a profoundly and permanently wounded WWI veteran.  The novel is about Jake's struggle to find a way to  deal with his wound and the desire he has for the great love of his life,  Brett Ashley.  This is not Hemingway's best book, but Jake's struggle is  heart-wrenching nonetheless.  In this novel, Hemingway's &quot;iceberg  technique&quot; is alive and well, which has led many readers to  misunderstand Jake's wound and its implications.  The Sun Also Rises should  be read by anyone who values great literature.  It is hard to believe that  Hemingway was only 27 years old when this novel was published! A wonderful  read by what I consider one of America's finest authors.
0385486804|3.0|Chris McCandless was admirable in a lot of ways--he had the cajones to do what many people dream of but few people do.  He did not die because he was ill-prepared (don't forget he managed to live for 3 months+), he died because he lived the way he wanted and took the risks he needed to take.   I'm glad our society can still produce people like him, and not just  Backstreet Boys fans .  The only fault I find with him is the worry he put  him family through.<br />&quot;Into The Wild&quot; is well done, unfortunately  even at 200 pages it seems padded.  The author adds chapters on other  wayward dreamers, which were interesting, and his own youth, which was not.   The book is worth reading, but there just isn't much to it.
B000002TQV|5.0|After the absolute debachle that was \\"Pablo Honey\\", Radiohead released the finest rock album of their career. \\"The Bends\\" is nothing more than a rock album: a layered, lyrically deep, beautiful and emotional rock record, granted, but rock record none the less. This has depth that was only hinted at on the aforementioned \\"Pablo\\", and even then, only 2 or 3 of the songs gave that hint. This is also the most accessable album of Radiohead's career. When I say that, I'm not insulting \\"OKC\\" or \\"Kid A\\", just acknowledging that this is the easiast of their albums to become attached on the first listen. You must own this. Buy this.
B00001U0GQ|3.0|First of all, if you haven't seen this movie, go see it RIGHT NOW!  The action sequences are excellent, not to mention the plot and music score.<br />That said, I had high hopes for the DVD release, as it promised  extended sequences, 5.1 audio, and better image quality.  As for the first  two, I was not dissapointed.  The extra scenes contributed to the plot and  enhanced the action.  Also, the music is excellent.  The image quality,  however, leaves something to be desired, which is why I only gave it 3  stars.  The MPEG translation (the process of converting 35 mm film into DVD  format) was horrible with dark scenes and motion (the waterfall scene was  especially bad) resulting in a blurred and/or pixelated image.  All I can  say is that I hope they release another version.<br />Oh, and if you don't yet  have it, grab the soundtrack.  It's kind of in the theme of The Rock or  Crimson Tide, by which I mean that it is really, really good.
B000002X7V|5.0|The late Christiane Jaccottet left a remarkable set of solo Bach recordings: at least thirteen full-length issues that keep appearing on different labels.  Her style featured a natural plasticity of phrasing, a  beautiful legato,  subtle arpeggiation, well-judged tempos,  graceful  ornamentation, and an unproblematic approach to the music.  She  &quot;simply&quot; played the music with directness and understanding. In  her performances we hear Bach allowed to make his own effects, and this  works wonderfully.   Straight to the heart and the mind.<br />Don't let the  low price make you dubious.  Performances of this caliber would be worth  buying at seven times the asking price.  What are you waiting for?
6303402348|5.0|Forrest Gump is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it almost made me cry. When I first brought this movie I saw it 50 times and I still love it. Sometimes I think this movie is a true story but it's not it looks like one  though because it seems so realistic in a way. I am so glad it won an  oscar. If you look really close before the movie's over the boy who played  Little Forrest is Haley Joel Osment, the same actor who played in the Sixth  Sense. But I thought this movie was really good and it's not boring at all,  it's a MUST see movie.
B00000373U|5.0|I went to the cinema with my girlfriend to see Good Will Hunting.  I didn't like the film at all, the only thing which stopped me falling asleep was the brilliant soundtrack.  The next day I went to the store to buy it  and discovered that most of the songs were by Elliot Smith, so instead of  getting the soundtrack I decided to purchase Either/Or...possibly the best  decision I ever made.  Elliot Smith is blessed with a rare musical gift  which he exploits to its full advantage on this album.  Either/Or is a  thoughtful cascade of beautiful, slow guitar melodies which should sound  depressingly melancholoy but instead somehow manage to maintain an  energetic resonance. It is one of the most relaxing albums I have ever  heard; providing a constant flow of great tunes.  After you hear the  brilliance of Elliot Smith you will wonder how such a talent has escaped  you for all these years.
B000002C1Z|5.0|&quot;Animals&quot; is the albun that showcases what the team of Waters-Gilmour can do when they work together. With David Gilmour (the musical genius) playing extremely well- even for him, &amp; Roger Waters  (the creative genius) taking on George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot;,  they came up with a political music classic. Despite the Outrageous lengths  of the songs, (respectively 1 minute, 17 minutes, 13 minutes, 11 minutes,  &amp; 1 minute), you stay listening the entire time. <br />Another thing I've  noticed is that this being a very politically themed album, was also  released the same year as when the punk movement broke... coincidence?
B00001U0GQ|3.0|First, I'd like to say that if you haven't seen this movie, go see it RIGHT NOW.  The action is amazing, but equally good is the plot and music score.  Also, the extended sequences in the DVD really help in  understanding the plot as well as heightening the action sequences.<br />That  said, I had high hopes for the DVD, especially the 5.1 sound and picture  quality.  On the sound, I was not dissapointed:  it was amazing, especially  in the running battle at the end.  The image, however, left a lot to be  desired, which is why I only gave this movie 3 stars.  The MPEG conversion  of the movie (the process where they convert the 35 mm film into DVD  format) was definitely sub-par, almost to the point of being unwatcheable  (as in the waterfall scenes).  It seems that quick motion did not encode  well, resulting in a blurryness and pixelation in many scenes.<br />Therefore,  while the movie was excellent, the DVD version leaves a lot to be desired.
B00003CWL5|5.0|This beautiful movie dealing with some of the world's most twisted subjects shows you can be a beautiful teen, a lovable teen, an obessed mom, a depressed father or a hot young man, and love can still find it's way to  you. The best movie I've seen since Gone with the Wind
B00000F5KH|5.0|Possibly the best foreign film to come out of Brazil since the days of &quot;Pixote,&quot; and &quot;Black Orpheus,&quot; &quot;Central Station&quot; is a heartbreaking account of a retired school teacher who  befriends a recently-orphaned boy at Rio de Janiero's bus terminal.  Fernanda Montenegro is fabulous as Dora, a single woman who lives her life  for herself. Vincius de Oliveira, who plays Josue, is amazing in his first  starring role. Personally, I feel that Montenegro was robbed of the Best  Actress Oscar due to Gwyneth Paltrow's popularity that year, and it is a  tragedy, for her performance is powerful. The film was also robbed of the  Best Foreign Language Oscar due to Roberto Benigni's annoying antics and  Miramax's powerful lobbying. The film which takes you from the beautiful  Braganza-era buildings of Rio to the Brazilian hinterlands is like a dream.  The vastness and beauty of Brazil and its' inhabitants are covered with  sensitivity and grace by director Walter Salles. It was refreshing to see  many of Brazil's sprawling developments, many which were created by the  militry junta that ruled the country from the 1960's to 1980's due to lower  density rates in major costal cities and to protect the country's borders  from communist insurgents in the Guianas. If you need a good tearjerker in  the tradition of the Color Purple, please see this masterpiece.
B000000W5N|5.0|This and Exile On Main Street are two of the best albums ever released to this day. In my opinion, the Stones' lyrical and musical genius surpass that of any other band around. Every song on this album is great, but my  favorites are Sway, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, I Got The Blues, Dead  Flowers, and Moonlight Mile. Buy this album, you can't go wrong.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This top-notch album from Blink 182 is an outstanding demonstration of what these guys can do.  With hits like What's My Age Again? and All The Small Things, this is an album Blink 182 fans can't pass up.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is one of the most awesome CDs I have ever heard! Every track is awesome! GET THIS CD!<br />Oh, and I saw them at Sno-core! (Sorry, had to throw that in...)
B00003CWN2|5.0|I saw this movie, enjoyed all of the scenes in which she was Brandon Teena undercover But when she was discovered, i started to cry my eyes out. The graphic rape scenes were so intense, I had to close my eyes so I could  catch my breath. The acting was phonomenal, especially Chloe Sevigny and  Hilary Swank. *****
B00003CWLE|5.0|I loved this movie.  The local reviewers stated how awful the romance in this film was.  After seeing the movie I wondered if they had watched the same movie I did.  I cried through the while ending.  There were so many  subtle things that the film is worth seeing more than once so you can catch  them all!
B00004NRWH|5.0|This is one of those albums that just gets better every time you hear it.  I'm an avid Nickelback fan having lived in Vancouver BC during the time they brought out Curb and The State.  Do yourself a favour and buy this CD.   These guys are awesome live too if you get the chance!
0783221487|3.0|I know the book by heart... The whole depth of this complexuniverse is totally missing, we just follow a story of a messiah-to-beyoung noble boy (who never chaves nor sweats) and the director' cuts make the scenery a succession of episodes with merely no links between them. Some actors are bad (Sean young), and others annoy themselves to death (Max Von Sydow). But i believe it would be a beautiful, amazing and successful movie if some of the missing parts were put back. I have at home the marvel' Dune Comics, it includes cut passages. and, sorry for advertising, get the n° 33 &amp; 34 of VideoWD, and read them. You'll get surprised. I wish i could see the &quot;long&quot; version of Dune, as it was never released in Europe, or so expensive that no-one could buy it.  To me, Lynch tried to do his best with that book, to make something that would not be too stodgy on screen, give body to a thousand ideas, with not so much money and not so much time, that the result could not possibly be what he expected.  That was simply impossible. In other hand, except for the weirding devices, the story was not so much changed. Read &quot;Blade Runner&quot; then read the Philip K Dick' book, then try to find what's in common... This is why i think we should not be so severe.<br />Sorry if i wasn't completely understandable, after all i'm French !
B00001OH1S|3.0|If you're like me, you saw the movie and thought the music and score were magnificent.  If you're like me, you walked out of the theater determined to buy the soundtrack.  But please don't be like me from there on and buy  it.  The score is good, but it is just so short.  The total time of Bill  Conti's whimsical score on the disc is literally about ten minutes, and  most of that is repetitive.  I was thoroughly disappointed with this disc,  and I think my copy will soon find itself being auctioned off on eBay.
630575067X|3.0|I just wanted to start out saying that I am a big Star Wars fan, owning the orginal trilogy and a few cheesy pieces of Star Wars merchandise.  I went to the theatre the 2nd day of its long awaited release.  In one word:  disappointed!  I know the special effects were awesome.  With the great pod  racing scene and lightsaber dual against Darth Maul.  Thats what made it  get three stars.  The acting was nothing respectable and rather corny.   Anakin's &quot;Yippe&quot; had less enthusiasm then my keyboard does. I  would buy this but only settled for a viewing in the theatre and a rental  because no DVD!  Which is very upsetting.  George Lucas, you are losing  sales with a no dvd decision, including mine!
B000002KDI|5.0|An amazing record.<br />For those who are only familiar to Young via his association with Pearl Jam, this live album (and the later 2 disk Weld) are an easy choice.  Neil shows the world of the 70's that bar chords aren't  the only thing that sounds good with distortion.  Neil goes from clean to  amazingly heavy without breathers.<br />This is one of those rare 70's live  albums that moves along at a fast pace (unlike other &quot;classics&quot;  such as The Song Remains the Same).<br />A must have for those into Neil's  heavier side.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This c.d this THE best NiN album. Period. No question. I think people just over look it becaue on the song shotage. &quot;Last&quot; is one of the most angry, and explosive songs I heard and is with out a dout on my list  of favs and this c.d is on my fav c.d list. Not one bad song. Trent is a  wizard at his music and a wizard at expresing his feelings though amazing  music. If my have P.H.M or downward spiral this is a must have. IF you like  the other Nin albums of just like heavy music this belongs in your  colection. Worth the money.....Really!
6303589170|4.0|I think Karen Allen is one of the most underappreciated actresses around.  Just watch what she does with this role, it'll make your heart melt.  Jeff  Bridges manages to hit just the right note as the alien trying to  understand humanity, and falling in love along the way. The chemistry  clicks in a gentle, wonderful way. The only false element, and I think it  handicapped the movie and prevented it from being truly great, were the  &quot;bad guys&quot;, the military persuing the Bridges character. As eager  as I was to buy into the plot, the antagonists were cartoonish. A more  menacing, subtle threat to the alien's mission would have given the movie a  second, darker dimension.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I bought this cd a little while ago.  I completely new what I was expecting, after I heard the song &quot;What's my age again?&quot;  If you didn't know that is the first single of Enema.  The Drumming is still very  good even though Mark (bass) and Tom (guitar) lost former drummer and  friend Scott Raynor.  He was replaced however with the incredible talent of  Travis Barker.  The vocals have improved and so had the music in general.   As for the tracks on the album, most of them are the usual blink 182 style  but my ear really noticed Adam's Song.  It is a really good song and  different!  This one is worth buying.  Blink 182 has definitly grown as a  band since the last record.
0783239408|5.0|I NEVER SAW A MOVIE SO DARK AND SCARY LIKE THIS BEFORE.   IT WON 5 OSCARS.

0679746048|5.0|I just finished this book this morning, and I found it incredibly entertaining.  It's very impressive that someone can write about an experience such as the one Kaysen went through so well.  It just goes to  show the courage that people can actually posess.  I also found it very  educational on the subject of mental health.  Very good.
6304466498|5.0|This movie is hilarious! Although I'm sure that the fact I was obessesed to an unhealthy degree with the Star Wars movies as a child (I was CONVINCED someday I would marry Luke Skywalker, but enough about me...)  made me love this movie all the more. May the schwartz be with you! Ohhhh,  I'm melting, what a world, what a world....
B000002MY3|5.0|This CD is, in my opinion, is the best that I have in my entire collection.  And I have a pretty big collection of every type of music.  I like everything when it comes to music, which really means this CD has  really proven itself.  Many people consider Alanis Morissette angry, but I  think that all of this music is not about anger, but wanting everyone to  know about her pain.  Some people say that pain makes the best music, and  Alanis has enough to go around.  Alanis is a simply beautiful woman and she  has a wonderful voice, though her high screechy notes don't always show her  voice to it's potential.  Her lyrics are the most soulful of all that I  have ever heard.  She uses eloquent words for her lyrics that the average  person would have no ida what they mean.  I love to get the the CD jacket  out and sing along with the music (the lyrics are on the jacket).  Even the  album cover shows some emotional distress or something.  Since I loved  Alanis so much, I recently bought her CD Supposed Former Infatuation  Junkie.  I know it sounds weird, but I didn't think it was as good becuase  it didn't include the &quot;anger&quot; that this album contains.  The kind  of world we live in doesn't want to hear about being at peace, I guess, but  this CD is still a classic.        There is absolutely no song on the  entire album that I hate, unlike most records these days.  &quot;All I  Really Want&quot; isn't the best song on the CD, but it was a very good way  to begin everything.  This really complemets her feelings in a way of  utter, passionate, raw expression.  &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is probably  there the whole &quot;angry girl&quot; idea came from.  It is a little  obnoxious.  It contains her ideas on her ex-boyfriend and obviously she is  not happy.  Either way, this song is extremely free and unfocused.  She  just jets around from topic to topic in, I must admit, an agry fashion.  If  you want one of her more mellow songs, &quot;Perfect&quot; is it; plus,it  has a good message, bust I don't seem to like it quite as much as all the  others.  &quot;Hand in my Pocket,&quot; &quot;Right Through You,&quot; and  &quot;Forgiven&quot; are all about Alanis being okay with the way she is  now and comming to peace with herself.  &quot;You Learn&quot; focuses on  the life lessons that everyone goes through and that in everything you do,  a bit of knowledge is gained.  It's a very strong song.  &quot;Head Over  Feet&quot; is about Alanis finding love again and &quot;Mary Jane&quot; is  the story about a girl who doesn't love herself.  &quot;Ironic,&quot;  probablt my favorite song, is so inspiring it's hard to explain.  By the  end of the CD, though, the songs like &quot;Not the Doctor&quot; and  &quot;Wake Up&quot; seem a little to redundant and too much like the ones  throughout the entire thing.  The hidden track is simply beautiful and  emotional.        I think it's obvious to ALanis Morissette lovers that  this girl put so much effort and uncensored passion into this CD and I  cannot reccomend it any higher.
0790729628|2.0|I definitely like the Director's Cut better than the released version; however, the transfer quality on this DVD is really inexcuseable.  The image wobbles throughout the film, the clarity and sharpness are really not  up to par, and there's no 5.1 audio.  Apparently, a new &quot;Collector's  Edition&quot; is in the works; I'd wait for that to come out before buying  this movie.
B00003XB8K|3.0|I revised my star rating since this CD grew on me after a few listens.  Standout tracks are &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; &quot;Endless Quest&quot; and two others -- titles escape me as I don't have the CD handy.  If you're into mellow groove music for a Sunday afternoon drive in the country or want aural wallpaper as you read the paper, this is very good.  Nothing of substance lyrically, but just relaxing mood music.
6303614493|4.0|not for the language. There wasn't much but it certainely made itself clear. I didn't feel there was any need for it in this movie at all! So little kids and parents be warned! Still it's a great lot of fun and  deffinitly worth looking into! :-) check it out. A good ending and good  plot points make it exciting and fun with some pretty good laughs  throughout.
B00000IPAX|4.0|A score of people around here have been upset at the fact that Blink 182 is not making the kind of music that it used to.  It's not quite punk any more.  Well, I have to say to that: I agree, but I still like this new  style of music for them--pop.  Every group goes through trial and error and  their music grows.  Some people are more resistant to change than I am.  I  like both kinds, personally.  So I'll offer you that if you don't like pop  music you may not like this becuase it's not what it used to be.            Most of the songs can be a little bit childish in their lyrics, but I guess  I and most other people find that's whats so intriguing about them.   They're not afraid to run around town naked or appear on their own album  cover with in their underwear.  It's kind of fun because you don't know  what to expect next.  But, appart from all of this, I like the music in  &quot;Adam's Song&quot; because it talked very seriously about the issue of  teenage suicide, which is something a lot of people need to hear about it.       One thing that can be bothering, though, is that for the most part the  members of Blink 182 aren't very good singers.  They know the fundamentals  of singing, so obviously they've taken voice lessons, but no matter how  many voice lessons you take, you can only learn to be a better singer.   Voice lessons cannpt improve your voice.  But don't let that keep you from  buying the CD.  It has very smooth transmitions between songs and can be  very funny.  They also are very serious in a few important songs.  I highly  reccomend it.
6305807086|5.0|This was a surprisingly good film.  When I first saw a trailer for this film i was a little leary about seeing this one.  When I did I'd have to say this one one of the top five films of the year.  All of the actors were  on par and better.  The direction of this film was outstanding and the use  of acting and imagery was great.  I cant recomend this one any higher.  It  may turn off some viewers but for any true fan of film its a must see.  I  know I haven't given much of the story but i feel  strongly that if I were  to, you as a potentail viewer may draw your own conclusions to where the  film leads.  Remember no one can be told what Being John Malkovich is  about... You must see it for your self.
B00000K19E|5.0|You'll love it, any sci-fi fan would and many more. I also can't wait for the next two movies as it was originally intended as a trilogy. Do yourself a favor and check this one out, I used to have dreams that were something  like this! when I was younger and more creative! :)    I especially liked  Morhpeous, don't know if I spelt that right!<br />p.s.   oh and if there's any  of you Transformer's fans out there run on over and click on DVD format,  throw in your vote for it to come out on DVD! You'll be making a lot of  people happy!  =)
B000023VR6|4.0|Truly, the only one that comes off nice lyrically is Eminem.  But the beats are very good.  Mostly every song has a very good beat, Dre is an amazing producer but isn't, and never will be an outstanding MC.  But the  album is very good.....
1573227978|5.0|Garland's &quot;The Beach&quot; far surpasses the limpid film version. For one so young, Garland has created a shimmering coctail of suspense, angst, shock, and accusation--all set in a deceptive paradise and communicated in  superb prose. This book has the distinction of being a page-turner that  really allows the reader to marvel at the splendid quality of writing and  storytelling. A definitive and irresistible work, destined to be very hard  to repeat. Poor Garland.

B0000024JA|5.0|'Tical' is a very dark album, from the very first track, until 'METHOD Man Remix'.  Rza produces most of the tracks so you know the beats will be ill.  But Meth come off ill in his lyrics.  The better songs are Bring Da' Pain,  Meth vs. Chef, and some others.  But my favorite track is 'Release Yo'  Delf' just cause Meth spits some hot lyrics and the beat is nice.  But  definatley a solid album.
0440178002|5.0|Look up the word 'sweeping' in any dictionary, and you find &quot;James Clavell's Shogun.&quot; A masterpiece of plotting, character development, intrigue, romance, suspense, historical research, and human spirit, this book will stand the test of time and surely ranks as one of the great  pieces of historical fiction ever written upon this earth. I have read it  yearly for well over a decade and its power to amaze never dims. It is the  only literary work that has ever made me weep for the sole reason that the  story comes to an end, that there must be a last page. reading 'Shogun' is  a humbling, masterful experience.
0790729407|5.0|When you think that Michael Collins was only 31 when he died his story is all the more amazing. Jordan has done a brilliant job in covering the complex character of Collins - a leader, a terrorist and yet a man of  peace.
B00000F5KH|5.0|From the opening frame of &quot;Central Station,&quot; the spell of emotional, spiritual enchantment begins. This film is a marvel strictly for its simplicity, for its faithfulness to the reality of human experience,  for its authenticity in depicting Brazilian city life, and, not least, for  its stunning performances. Fernanda Montenegro is a shimmering jewel, a  credit to her nation, a brilliant interpreter and sorceresss of the screen.  She is nothing short of captivating. No actress since Giulietta Masina can  act with the whole self as Fernanda can in this film. This is a must-have  for any serious film collector, and the DVD version is out and out  stunning. I think it was far and away a better film than &quot;Life Is  Beautiful,&quot;... that shocking piece of celluloid ham.
1573225517|4.0|I read the 1853 (yes, 1853) short story by Herman Melville named &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener. A Story of Wall-street&quot; the day before seeing the movie &quot;High Fidelity.&quot;  I am struck by the similarities between &quot;Bartleby&quot; and &quot;High Fidelity.&quot;   Both stories are about the boredom of dealing with records and copies of  records.  Both focus on the owner and his clerks.  Both are about  transitions:<br />- In &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, from youth/vinyls to  adulthood/CDs<br />- In &quot;Bartleby&quot;, from rural/farm to  urban/industry<br />None of the reviews of this book that I have read have  mentioned this relevance or &quot;coincidence.&quot;
0780021150|5.0|This early serial killer movie from Fritz Lang has influenced practically every other serial killer film ever made.  Peter Lorre is the bug-eyed, pathetic and vaguely sympathetic child-murderer (the 'vampire of  Dusseldorf') being captured and put on trial by the rough inhabitants of  the town.  Although this very early talkie is far slower paced then the  equivalent films of today, it is intelligent and, in its day,  seminal.<br />The transfer to DVD is excellent considering the film's age,  definitely superior to the crackly version I used to own on VHS.<br />This  serial killer film is artistic and influencial, although I preferred Fritz  Lang's earlier classic sci-fi Metropolis.
B00000K19E|5.0|After watching this movie in the theaters I was incredibly confused.  I couldn't understand why Keanu came across so believable.   I knew from past films that his acting is bad (borderline atrocious).  Remember Bill &amp;  Ted?  Point Break?  Dangerous Liasons?  Speed?  I can go on.  <br />Well.  I  recently came to a revelation.  Keanu played Neo so well because.....  HE  ONLY HAD LIKE 10 LINES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE!   <br />But seriously, this  is the best out there in terms  of visual effects, sound, and pure  imagination.  And the DVD has plenty of goodies for all those  &quot;behind-the-scenes-buffs&quot;.  I haven't experienced any glitches in  the DVD.  All smooth and constant picture and sound.  Enjoy.  And for the  next 2 installments, let's pray that Keanu shuts up again!
B000021Y74|5.0|I originally saw Lola 3 times in the theater in the summer of ninety nine. I have watched it 11 more times on the VHS (I have the DVD but no player yet). This is my favorite all-time movie. It is enjoyable on many levels.  The Soundtrack kicks. Rent, buy, and enjoy. I also enjoy the many Lola  Rennt message boards on the net.
6305014140|4.0|This review is directed to those who, like myself, are not avid anime fans.  I own three anime DVDs: Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and Ninja Scroll, and I enjoy all three.  However, Ninja Scroll is far the most enjoyable to  watch.  But this review is not a comparison of the three.<br />I would like to  praise the writer/director of Ninja Scroll for creating such an exciting  and artistic work while at the same time retelling the ancient tale of the  reluctant hero.  The plot was sufficient enough to withstand the weight of  the amazing action sequences and fun sexual content.  The character  development was superb.  Jubei (the hero) is not portrayed an all-powerful  superhero.  Instead, we just see a gifted fighter with an immense will to  survive.  <br />The action scenes are among the best I have ever seen, with  battle choreography that is comparable to that of the best filmakers.  The  villians are imaginitive and original, not to mention devious.  The plot is  extremely imaginitive, touching on topics that are not common to the  &quot;super robots and cute little girls&quot; world of Japanese Anime:  love triangles, rape, greed, self esteem, and homosexuality. This film was  enjoyable from beginning to end, and if you are searching to expand your  collection into something new, pick up this DVD.  Its pure enjoyment.
B000000H57|5.0|There is much debate over what the best Type O Negative album is. Most opinions center around the Heavy Gothic Rock of &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;. Some prefer the neanderthal trashing of &quot;Slow Deep &amp; Hard&quot;.  My personal opinion, however, is that &quot;October Rust&quot; has been  Type O Negative's shining moment of glory.  October Rust is by far the most  eclectic, complex and sensual of Type O's LP's. The album twists and turns  through a path of light and darkness unlike any other before (or after) it.  The songs fall into either one of four categories: there are the heavy,  dark, powerful 'Black Sabbathesque' like songs, such as &quot;Burnt Flowers  Fallen&quot;, &quot;In Praise of Bacchus&quot;, &quot;The Glorious  Liberation...&quot;, and &quot;Wolf Moon&quot;. Then there are the  psychadelic, up-beat and funky songs such as &quot;Be My Druidess&quot;,  &quot;My Girlfriends Girlfriend&quot;, and &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;. Next  there are the ambient, spiritual, and beautifully melodic songs such as  &quot;Love You To Death&quot;, &quot;Green Man&quot;, and &quot;Die With  Me&quot;. Finally there are two hauntingly dark, depressing and morbid  epics in the form of &quot;Red Water (Christman Mourning)&quot; and  &quot;Haunted&quot;. All in all, &quot;October Rust&quot;, although  slightly more commercial than Type O's other recordings, is their best  album. You can hear their hearts, emotions, souls and passions poured into  the uplifting music. Experience the enchantment today.
B00003CWN2|4.0|I know that most of you that gave this movie three stars or less were disgusted and shocked by it. I think that what most of you felt was the prime tool used in the attempt to make an impact with its audience: shock  value. I have to admit, I cringed a little bit when I was watching the  lesbian sex scenes, but I had to remind myself that relationships like that  are going on EVERYWHERE. Then there's the strange behavior of each  character with the exception of Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank. Everyone  drinks all day and gets high every night in a dark and foreboding wasteland  called Falls City, Nebraska, bumper skiing and generally acting like a  bunch of idiots. Trailer trash, to put it simply. Everyone is warped in  their own weird way, whether it be from something behavioral or something  sexual. I also had to remind myself that there's trailer trash like that  EVERYWHERE too. Most people know this, know that they can go into a bad  part of town and see it instead of turning on their televisions and have to  watch it, but I think that's what this movie needed. All throughout,  there's a strong sense of discomfort for every subject. That's life.  There's always going to be something that people don't like to talk about,  that they won't admit or they're trying to avoid, that they're biased  against or have a deep hatred for. Homosexuality, dysfunctional families,  drugs, alcoholism and indecent behavior are all the integral parts for a  depraved story such as this one, and the raw manner in which it was  directed was the foundation for the shock value and the disturbing but all  too real truth, sad as it may be. Things as crazy and depressing as this  happen everyday. This movie is a sad reminder of murders such as the  inhumane ending of the life of Matthew Sheppard, a gay high school student  who was harrassed and finally killed by fellow classmates. There's not a  glint of hope throughout the film, but the performances are what make this  movie watchable. Hilary Swank is unbelievably convincing, her mannerisms  and boyish charisma endearing and impressive. Chloe Sevigny is her  right-hand, a powerful and emotional addition to the ill-fated romance that  they share, and the blind love that tenaciously survives even after Brandon  Teena's true identity is painfully revealed. I have to admit, the shock  value worked on me, especially during the final half hour of the movie when  all the prejudice and hate in the world unite to reveal the hideous face of  evil, once again taking more human lives. Even though there are several  warning labels posted in these customer reviews, please give this film a  fighting chance. It will touch you in its own way, and it will teach you  more than expect to learn.ary Swank is unbelievably convincing, her mannerisms  and boyish charisma endearing and impressive.

0440219078|4.0|Our grade 6 class had to read the giver. I liked it, but the end didn't make sence. Jonas lives in a world that is perfect. They can't see colors, and they get assigned a job  when they are 12.  Each family has a mother, a father, a girl and a boy.  This book was ok, but I would reccomend this book to 12 year olds and up.
6304711875|5.0|Directer Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson present &quot;Scream&quot;. A wonderfully scary, humorous, and horrendously gory horror film. You'll think about it every time the phone rings. If you're  into the horror genre, you'd better see &quot;Scream&quot; with a pillow to  cover your face!
B00003CWQ2|5.0|Fight Club is a great movie!   A lot of people say that it is too violent and doesn't say anything!  Fight Club isn't that violent.  It only explores how people are feeling today.  Fight Club shows you excactly how a lot of  people feel.  Trapped in this impression that we have to buy that or have  this.  Also that people are way too stressed and one of the only ways to  release this is to actually hit somebody.      It is also very well acted  by Norton, Pitt, and Carter.  Norton delivers once again with a wonderful  portrayal of the nameless narrator.. Pitt is very good as the crazy Tyler.    It is defiantly a must see!
0783225881|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews of this movie, I just had to comment. I will quote the drummer in my band  &quot;If you don't like this movie, You've got a hole in your soul and you don't eat chicken on  Sunday! &quot; In other words, you're hard-hearted and anti-American! This  movie is most definitely NOT about baseball. It's about coming to terms  with your emotions. It's about realizing that life is too short to walk  around like a mind-numb robot, with no feelings or passion. Laugh if you  want, but I cry at movies. I cannot watch the famous &quot;catch&quot;  ending without crying my heart out. I realize that it's just a story. But  it touches me on several levels. A &quot;feel-good&quot; movie?  Sure, and  what the heck is wrong with that? Do I wanna pay to watch something that  makes me feel bad? NO. Baseball inacuracies?  SO WHAT! That's not the  point! The point is: Live life to the fullest, chase after your dream. Just  LIVE IT! Remember, life is short.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|The Duo's first album was permantly stuck in my cd player for 2 years almost. The first time I heard it I knew that I would never hear anything like it again, and was very scepticle that the next album would live up to  the first...i am so pleased to say that I have been proven wrong...This  album is better. Never has an album lifted my spirts (affirmation), made me  cry (two beds and a coffee machine), made me groove (chained to you) and  made me broody (Gunning down Romance - possibly my fave track). For two  days straight I was stuck in my room listening to it. As lead singer Darren  Hayes had wanted, it was the soundtrack to life. GET THIS ALBUM.
6305807086|2.0|OK, I understand the message behind this film, that we're all obsessed with celebrity and that we should be happy with who we are, But this film was too weird and misleading to me. John Cusack's character is a struggling  puppet master and Cameron Diaz is his sexually confused wife. But why John  Malkovich's body? He's not that big of a star. And how Catherine Keener got  an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I couldn't understand how the old man got  into Malkovich's body or the scene in his subconscious. The only reason for  my two stars is the message.
B00000K19E|5.0|I absolutly LOVED this movie! The special effects, the sounds, and ESPECIALLY the plot are the best I've ever seen. I watched this movie 3 times over when I rented it and I still can't get enough. I agree with  anyone who says they wanted more at the end, and anyone who knows ANYTHING  about a sequel better e-mail me.
B0000024SI|5.0|Few albums come close to the rock &amp; roll grandeur of Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited.  It veers through folk rock, blues, and classic garage sounding equally sinister and beautiful as Dylan alternates between  soothing melodies to hard, bluesy rock, all sharing a motif of variegated,  usually ingeniously vague imagery.  Highway 61 effectively made way for a  new breed of rock, one that didn't need to be tranquilized to assert  passionate intellect.  One of the greatest. Best Tracks: &quot;Like A  Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;Tombstone Blues,&quot; &quot;Desolation  Row,&quot; &quot;From A Buick 6&quot; Rating: 10/10
B000000WA4|5.0|I know that not everyone would agree with that statemet, but I have owned this album since 1996 and it still sounds just as fresh as the day I bought it.  The music is extrememly eclectic and the wide variety of songs cover  just about every emotion one can possibly feel, but not admit to.  Epics  songs such as Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Tonight, Tonight, and  Thru The Eyes of Ruby are worth the price of the whole album themselves.   Overall, this cd is definitely a classic and a must have for both Pumpkins'  fans and anyone who loves rock music.
B000002I25|5.0|This is one of the finest debut albums, not to mention ALBUMS of all time.  Their signature fusion of rock, classical, blues, and jazz with Jim Morrison as 20th century troubadour remains completely unmatched and  incomparable in its style, vocals seemingly texturing the intertwined  guitar riffs and organ sounds into peculiar rock avante-gard theater.   Hypnotic, euphoric melodicism (much thanks to Ray Manzarek) and vigorous,  sometimes sexual tension conceive what seems less like an album and more  like a spiritual journey...  &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is one of rock's  defining moments, a self-indulgent anthem all the way down to its track  length...  The Doors set the bar so high with this debut that they even  fail to surpass, instead approaching its greatness with L.A. Woman and  establishing a tract for the likes of Patti Smith, Jesus and Mary Chain,  Iggy Pop, and Echo and the Bunnymen. Best Tracks: &quot;Light My  Fire,&quot; &quot;Take It As It Comes,&quot; &quot;Break On Through,&quot;  &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot; Rating: 10/10
B00000K19E|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  Everything about it rocks.  The very dark look and cinematography reminded me of movies like Dark City and Brazil.  The story was unique and original without being contrived.  The action in this  movie has some of the most amazing scenes I have ever seen.  The fight  scenes rival those of even John Woo films such as The Killer and Hard  Boiled.  The actors were all excellent, even Keanu Reeves, who gives a  minimalist, yet realistic performance.  I recently got it on DVD and was  amazed at the transfer quality.  Both the picture quality and the sound are  simply amazing.  Buy this DVD!
0380973464|4.0|Neal Stephenson's latest book, Cryptonomicon, will appeal to a wider fan base that his previous novels.  Having read all of Stephenson's previous novels (with the exception of the elusive The Big U) I was surprised to find this book lacking in ultra-futuristic technology, and presented as  more of a straight war story/business suspense novel.  As usual,  Stephenson's character development and prose is amazing, and if you work in  high-tech or mathematics you will instantly realize how well Stephenson  knows the personalities of these people.  As with Snow Crash, the book  takes a while to get up to speed, but once it does you'll find yourself not  wanting to put it down.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are many  potentionally confusing plot twists, so the reader must pay close attention  at times or risk getting lost.  Stephenson also gives a thorough grounding  in the mathematics of cryptography, although the pages of formulas and  explanations can thankfully be skimmed by the mathematically-challenged  (like myself) without losing the story.  The book also doesn't fall apart  towards the end as many thought Snow Crash did - in fact, at one point you  will smack your forehead when you realize how everything fits together, and  you can't wait to see how it ends.  Overall, an excellent read.
0440219078|5.0|I found this book to be thoroughly thought provoking. It went well beyond the bounds of a childrens book. It made you think of all the sacrifices to humanity that would be made to make a &quot;Utopia&quot; reality. In a since it reminded me of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. It did this because  it involved the subjugation or control of natural human urges. Hey, close  to a thousand people have reviewed this book. Why not buy it and draw your  own conclusions?
6305399212|5.0|I think that this is one of the greates sci-fi action movies ever made.  The intense nonstop action was totally amazing.  So my recommendation is to BUY THIS MOVIE as soon as possible.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This movie is more than just another Disney masterpiece.  The Jungle Book is a great tale of friendship and adventure.  Although almost every animated feature that was created during Walt Disney's life is a classic,  this one in particular holds a special place in the heart of many men (and  now thanks to video and DVD, boys) who saw it while growing up.  There  isn't a boy alive who can see this movie and not want to be Mowgli.  What a  life it would be to live in the jungle, with friends like Baloo and  Bagheera.  It is every young boys dream to be so free.<br />That is not to say  that only boys will love this movie.  As with all Disney films, this one  will be enjoyed by all members of the family, young and old.  I saw it  growing up, and never forgot my memories of the movie, and the days  afterward, singing the songs and dreaming of adventure.<br />The music in  The Jungle Book is some of the best in any Disney movie.  \\"The Bare  Necessities\\" is simply one of the best songs ever.  Add in the fantastic  animation and the characters that come to life (who wouldn't believe a bear  could sing after seeing this?), and you have one of the many classic Disney  stories.<br />Starring the voices of Disney regulars Phil Harris and Sterling  Holloway, as well as Sebastian Cabot (Mr. French, to those of my  generation) and many others, this movie is too good to not buy.<br />Get a  copy of this DVD before Disney removes it for another generation.  It is  the best that Disney has to offer.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Minimal violence, but much more suspense than today's slash and kill trash movies. Dialog -- ever heard of that Hollywood? This has discussion: about privacy, about relationships, about a murder. Basically, this movie has it  all, and Hitch did it with just a simple apartment complex set.<br />Also,  today's so-called starlets, step off! Grace Kelly is the best! She's  drop-dead gorgeous, love the accent, dresses to the hilt, has an incredible  smile and is intelligent. Of course, I probably left out many other great  qualities. Grace alone is enough to watch this movie.<br />I watched it twice  on the big screen last month and loved each and every minute of it! I sure  wish Hollywood would make a movie like this today.
B00002E285|4.0|Alan Parker's film &quot;Pink Floyd The Wall&quot; visualizes the offbeat, yet brilliant album by the band. The album's basic focus is alienation, and the film does an excellent job at showing that. It follows the life of a  famous rock singer, named &quot;Pink&quot;, who has a nervous breakdown and  becomes isolated from society. He literally builds a wall around himself,  and the movie focuses on how he deconstructs the wall, brick by brick.            The film's first 30 minutes or so don't make any sense, and that may  draw the viewer away from the film. There are many flashbacks that at first  seem unimportant and senseless, but are fully explained later. Still, after  the film, many scenes remain unclear and do not make sense.         With  that said, this is a visual masterpiece. The animation mixed with the real  life gives the viewer a feeling of isolation, and paranoia almost, taking  us into the mind of the isolated rock star. When I first saw the film, I  was just getting introduced to the great band, Pink Floyd, and I still  thouroughly enjoyed this film. Now that I know a lot about the band's  music, this film will be better next time around. The songs  &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; (One of my favorite songs) and &quot;Another  Brick in the Wall Part 2&quot; are exceptionally used, as with all the  other songs. This film is not just for Pink Floyd fans, because it vividly  paints a world of isolation and alienation. But if you are a fan though,  you will love this film regardless.
B000001GF9|5.0|This is a wonderful recording of one of Mozart's most powerful and moving choral works. The soloists, the Bavarian Radio Symphony, and the chorus are all superb. It reminds me of how Bernstein, even in his old age, was able  to execute a vibrant, energetic, and wonderful performance. This recording  also comes with two other wonderful works, the Ave Verum Corpus and the  Exultate Jubilate. Both of these, like the Mass, are wonderful and exciting  performances.
6304457383|5.0|The suspense builds till the very last minute thru the movie. This movie feels like u are watching a theater performance since the film largely takes place on just one set.  Audrey Hepburn outdoes herself here, so does  Alan Arkin as the bad guy. He is truly chilling. The end is so creepy,  don't watch this alone.

0782006809|4.0|Cary Grant is certainly not at his best here but it's really not his fault. This is just another one of those dime a dozen romantic comedies with a mediocre script. Doris Day seems a little mature for her goody two  shoe performance, but again that's the script. I do enjoy this movie though  despite itself, especially later on with Cary Grant running out of the  shower to catch up with Doris Day and her sleazy date. He doesn't look bad  in a towel eighter. This is no &quot;north by northwest&quot; but if u like  classic comedies this will do.
B00000K2SC|5.0|at first when i saw previews for this movie i thought it was going to be stupid. but when i actually saw the movie it was great. i loved it. It may seem a bit dull in the beginning, but its well worth the wait. neo looks  real good in the black.. w/ the guns..  its a great movie. i love watching  it. i recomend that if you haven't seen it, see it.
6300215741|5.0|Nice movie, elegantly shot on Location in Monocco. Grace Kelly is breathtaking, Cary Grant perfectly cast as the suave former jewel thief. Great chemistry, beautiful photography, romantic dialogue and  costumes to boot!  I never get tired of this movie. It also has Cary Grant  in a swimsuit on the beach and he wasn't bad for the times and his age. The  plot is a little thin at times and some of the scenes can get a little  corny (fireworks). This is a must have for any classic movie fan. (By the  way, I LOVE Alfred Hitchcock stuff in general, this is not his best by any  means)
0440219078|5.0|'The Giver' for me was a perfect book, and I've read it over 3 times.  The ideas of a utopian perfect society have been expressed by many authors, but Lois Lowry has created a vivid image to go along with the words.  'The Giver' will remain one of my favorite books.
044022165X|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book. I agree that the movie was good, but the book is by far better. I wish they wouldn't have changed things around in the movie, but due to time, they sometimes have to.  I think the book was very easy reading and a great story. I highly recommend this book  if your are looking to just sit back relax and get engrossed in a good  book.
B00003IPFK|5.0|It's been years since I last rented the laserdisc version of this -- and i'm glad it's finally out on DVD (although the LD transfer did look better).  Best non-gunfighter, western-themed movie ever made.  Interesting  interview clips with McMurtry, although the question-and-answer format is a  stupid idea -- a straight-through interview with him would have been much  more enjoyable (warts and all; it has obviously been edited-down from a  longer, probably rambling discussion of the book, etc.).  His discussions  about evolution of the story, the parallels to Don Quixote, and where the  title &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; came from and what it really means are the  best parts of the interview (and I'm now really irritated that for all  these years I never realized what it meant).
6305313687|5.0|If you are looking for a story about white supremacy, then this is the movie for you.  If you are looking for a story about how different views drive families apart, then this is the movie for you.  Or if you are  looking to just watch a good movie, then this is the movie for you.   American History X is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and Edward  Norton and Edward Furlong compliment each other tremendously.  Don't be  frightened by the topic of this movie, because once you watch it you will  be glad you did.
B000002KKS|5.0|The addition of Dio was incredible and this album sounds like none of the previous records. I wore the grooves out of this one.I believe it set the standard for metal in the 80s and beyond.&quot;Children Of The  Sea&quot;,&quot;Neon Knights&quot;,all of them are classics.BUY IT!
B0000009RT|5.0|The Mothers of Invention used to be a pretty good bar band called The Soul Giants until a 25-year-old Frank Zappa muscled his way into the top spot.  Thus began an illustrious career.  Freak Out! is an album that even people  who don't like Zappa's later work seem to enjoy, if only for the apparently  guileless garage clang of it all.  Not only was it the first rock double  album (not necessarily a great thing), it featured a bunch of toe-tappin'  pop songs and some entirely surreal freaking out on the fourth side.   Relish the kazoo horn section on &quot;Hungry Freaks, Daddy&quot;!   (Apparently they used kazoos because they couldn't afford session horn  players.)  Sing your children to sleep with the idiotic bounce of  &quot;Wowie Zowie&quot;!  Wonder why they're there with the insidious  &quot;You're Probably Wondering Why I'm Here&quot;!  Strange that the  follow-up, the even more surreal &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, cost far less  to record and yet sounds even more off-the-wall.  Zappa certainly became  more himself in later years, but this is the Mothers at their most  beguiling.  <br />Actually...sort of...charming.  In a grungy kind of way.
B000005RFQ|5.0|The remaster job is fantastic! &quot;Zero The Hero&quot; and &quot;Trashed&quot; are my favorites.The rhythm section is pulled up front and Iommi sounds like he is possessed.Gillan,maybe the best metal vocalist  is just one of the great things you'll find here.BUY IT !  This is the last  studio Sabbath album I own.I used to have The Eternal Idol but threw it  away.
B000002KE2|4.0|This was the most difficult Sab album for me to get into. I just don't like &quot;Changes&quot; although it is a welcome relief from the usual storm.I do think they were trying new ideas on this record.  &quot;Wheels&quot; and &quot;Snowblind&quot; are awesome.
B00003Q43A|1.0|About the only thing GOOD about this movie is the non-subtle patriotism so many folks out there have made fun of.  (Ignoring the fact, of course, that the the President--a ridiculous Bill Pullman--turns the fourth of July into  a &quot;world&quot; holliday.  Awww, isn't that so modern?  The movie is  War of the Worlds if that great Welles film was aired on ABC over three  days, with fifty or more forgettable characters spread out over the world.
B000002KMY|4.0|On it's own the album is very dark and heavy.&quot;Over And Over&quot; is a bit of a drag but the rest sort of hint at what Dio's solo career would be like.&quot;Sign Of The Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Falling Off The  Edge Of The World&quot; are classics.The title track was great in the  &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; movie.
6305311463|1.0|Criterion usually releases special versions of CLASSICS.  For the most part the films they release are wonderful, and have stood the test of time.  Why this one?  Come on folks, even you who enjoy this movie...is it a  classic?  No way!
B000002KIK|3.0|I do like the title track and &quot;Johnny Blade&quot; but the rest are unmemorable.Ozzy's heart wasn't in it and it shows.One of few albums that I have not replaced with the cd yet.
B00000F169|4.0|Why do so many people attack this film for it's special effects?  Come on, folks!  Did Spaceballs have great effects?  Did Flash Gordon?  And those movies weren't made by a student working on a shoestring budget.  Just kick  back and enjoy the film for it's humor and uniqueness...chances are, you'll  never see a movie as original as this for a long time
B000001FDI|4.0|Winwood's wailing can get to be too much at times.&quot;Do What You Like&quot; goes on way too long.The other 5 are beautiful.&quot;Presence Of The Lord&quot; features one of the most awesome solos Clapton ever did.No  one makes music like this anymore.I must also recommend 2 albums by Family  (Rick Grech's band): Music In A Doll's House and Family Entertainment.The  Blind Faith lp deserves its legendary status.
B00003CWPR|1.0|Well then this is the movie for you.  Go have a ball withit...it'll keep you talking for hours about how powerful it was, howmoving, how thought provoking... Then, once you've reasoned it out, rationalized in your mind why the film deserves to have taken up so much celluloid that would have served us better as &quot;Con Air&quot; sequels, explain to the world, or why you are giving it five stars. <br />Here's what I say this film is about, and why I give it 1 star (for technical brilliance alone).<br />A happy couple decides that they despise each other, want an affair, then love each other and want to work things out (or rather, f---) all in 24 hours.<br />Just because Kubrick made 2001 and Barry Lyndon doesn't mean he's flawless, and just because you went to film school doesn't make you a critic. In the end, this movie will be forever remembered as a mindless, juvenile sex romp and, I am deighted to say, will never rank among the classics.
B000000WJZ|5.0|this is one of the best cds ever made. in my opinon there isn't one bad song on the whole album. if you love the smashing pumpkins buy this cd, if you like the smashing pumpkins buy this cd, if you hate the smashing  pumpkins buy this cd; you will not be disappointed. (one of my favorite  rock songs, possibly my favorite, is 'disarm')...bottom line, just buy this  album
B00000J7J4|5.0|Carlos Santana steps up to the plate.  The pitcher throws a fastball labeled &quot;billboard charts&quot; right down the middle.  Santana smashes the ball all the way to the moon.  This is a metaphor for the real  world.  Santana HAS smashed the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts all the way to  the moon.  &quot;Supernatural&quot; has been at the top of the charts ever  since it came out, and has only recently dipped to #3.  If you don't  already own this CD, then you should definatly buy it.  It just simply is  the BOMB!   It never repeats, and the songs dont get old, no matter how  many times you listen to them.
B000002J7U|3.0|Call me a romantic, but to me, &quot;Voices&quot; sounded like an album from a man, who doesn' need to compete any more. It sounded like it had no real deep purpose to it, as if the musician had had nothing to strive  for.<br />While &quot;1492 - Conquest of Paradise&quot; was full of strong  emotions, &quot;Voices&quot; struck me as a bit bland in this aspect. In  style, this album is quite close to some later works of Mike Oldfield,  IMO.<br />Nevertheless, this is a well put together album, and I'm sure most  of the listeners will derive pleasure from listening to it.
6305075379|2.0|I'm a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I'm living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. It seems  stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and  not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I  bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the  American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know  at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found  the U.S version very disappointing. Also the picture quality on this US  version DVD of Mad Max 1 should have been better (It's more like VCD  quality). The Australian version of Mad Max 1, I would give 5 stars.
B00003CX95|4.0|From the bloody battles to the excellent acting, this movie stands as one of my favorite.  It's not historically accurate nor should it never had been thought of as.  After all we are talking about Hollywood, and  Hollywood is about entertainment.  The portrayal of a homosexual as a bad  guy seemed to be a rather lame attempt to attack the rather oppressive  Politically Correct attitude that has spread through American society in  order to stir up controversy and, as a result, sales.  Whether this was a  historical fact or not about the King's son I do not know so I may be  wrong.  A good movie for those who like action and can fall into a movie  easily, but don't look for groundbreaking acting or much character  development.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Notably talented musician Fiona Apple has somehow managed to surpass her impeccable debut record, &quot;Tidal.&quot; Considering the tumultuous amount of moronic music that was released last year (i.e.. Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, N'SYNC, Christina Aguilera, Limp Bizkit, Korn, Blink 182,  etc.), &quot;When The Pawn...&quot; is certainly the best album of  1999-2000. The excellent quality of her second album asserts Fiona Apple as  the most promising young artist in a music world which has become  marshmallowy soft, excessively commercialized, and shallow. The tantalizing  variety of her music, hypnotic piano-playing, the fascinating depth of her  meaningful lyrics, an passion of her voice collectively compose an album  that is creative, admirable, and inspiring.<br />   The title of the album has  instigated much controversy because of its unusual length. &quot;When The  Pawn...&quot; is actually the opening phrase of a 96 word poem which Fiona  wrote for the title. The poem is an allegorical reaction to the media's  relentless verbal harassment of artists. Fiona illustrated her point by  metaphorically equating these unscrupulous reporters to pawns on a chess  board, and how they bestow upon themselves the false authority of a king.  In the end, Fiona contends that after all the deliberation, it is the  musician, not the critic, who holds the truth to her/his respective  work.<br />   Every song in &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; has its own purpose,  and the transition between the different<br />songs is truly effective.  &quot;Limp&quot; is a powerful song which vividly describes the fury and  anger that she felt after being physically abused at a young age.  Subsequently, &quot;Love Ridden&quot; is a tranquil, soothing melody which  portrays the gradual deterioration of a romantic relationship. This superb  track is written and produced in the same spirit as Fiona's other poetic  and musical masterpiece from Tidal called &quot;Never is a Promise.&quot;  Musically, &quot;The Way Things Are&quot; is the most successful song  because it starts off slowly, but then the lyrics, music, and voice all  come to a dramatic climax in the middle. And finally, &quot;I Know&quot; is  the ideal concluding because it is a positive and hopeful lullaby.<br />    &quot;When The Pawn...&quot; is a crowning achievement for the young  artist, and this album undoubtedly solidifies Fiona as the most gifted and  original lyricist/musician of our generation. Throughout the album, she  establishes a tone of sadness, frustration, and in the end, redemption.  Furthermore, these emotions are portrayed creatively in a succession of  consistent, powerful, and rhythmic songs. A five star rating system does  not do justice to &quot;When The Pawn...&quot; because its greatness is  truly immeasurable.
B000001FXR|5.0|the biggest disappointment 4 me, was the way reggae turned out after the passing of this man. its potential never fully realised, bands &amp; singers today show no respect at all 4 the spirituality of this music form.  blues, coupled with a strong r &amp; b &amp; soul influence gave us this  1973 ground breaking album. the infectious beat &amp; the soulful wailing  of a man desperate 2 shower the world the love of the common everyday  rastafari. jah lives, jah loves, &amp; jah gave us bob marley. iree, becos  i'm feeling alright now. freedom means having nothing left 2 lose, where do  u go after u've turned up the dial all the way 2 ten? u pick up this album,  put this on, light urself a spliff, &amp; tell urself, the only time ur  really happy is when u never try. legalise it, don't criticise it, legalise  it - i will advertise it, for thine is the kingdom, the power &amp; the  glory forever &amp; ever, jah rastafari.
B00004SVIK|4.0|It was so great to hear some new (old) Pink Floyd when Roger Waters was in the band. He is a power-house lyricist, and producer, and he sings like a madman.  This is the real Pink Floyd, the Floyd with great, powerful,  cutting, thought-provoking lyrics, and music. David Gilmour is a tremendous  guitar player, a very exciting guitar player, and he does a wonderful job  on &quot;Is There Anybody Out There.&quot;<br />I really like this new CD set.  I am a great admirer of Roger Waters, so, you can imagine how terrific it  is for me to have some new material  featuring Mr. Waters to listen to.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I was 21 when London Calling came out, and I loved the rebellion present in almost every groove. Now I'm 41 with 2 kids, 2 cars, and a mortgage, but this is still (depending on what day it is) one of my 3 favorite albums.  The interesting thing is that many of the songs translate from youth-angst  (a pretty easy mark) to universal truths. Example: &quot;Death or  Glory&quot;, which crystalizes what it's like to lose your idealism, but  concludes that ultimately you don't have to. Absolutely a desert-island  album, but you already knew that, didn't you?
B00004BZ16|4.0|SANDINISTA! by the Clash is a triple album and contains a tremendsou amount of music. As the Clash was a very experimental group that liked to work with many different kinds of music, this album gave them the chance to  risk a lot of different ideas. And a lot of these ideas worked. There are a  lot of good songs on here. But there are also a significant number of  disappointments, too. Overall, the good far outweighs the bad, and this is  a good album to listen to.
B000001IPL|5.0|I absolutely love smash.  This has got to be the Offspring's best.  I mean it really relates to any measure.  If you have trouble describing your problems this cd can probably do it for you.  I personally think Come Out and Play describes alot of teens feelings.  Genocide is so true about the  real life world.  It talks about what you have to go through.  I went to a  military school, there you had to step over people to get where you needed.   I think that's what Genocide talks about.  I believe any Offspring fan  should have this cd.
B0000025P9|2.0|I gotta admit, hearing the songs &quot;Rosanna&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot; on the radio back in 1982 was quite enjoyable. Both of those songs ended up getting stuck inside my head for quite some time. But  when I finally got around to purchasing this album, in 1987, I was quite  disappointed. Most of the songs here sound fake, artificial, and phony.  Yes, I know that all three of those words mean the same thing. But this  album is so chock full of emptiness that I need to be redundant in my  choice of words to describe it. Most of the songs here are supposedly about  love, but in reality, I find it difficult to believe that the majority of  the songs here are based on genuine feelings. Instead, it sounds as if a  bunch of people sat down at a meeting, pulled out a book on how to write  songs, and used some kind of a formula to compose most of this album. A lot  of the music here is downright empty and bland. And when I do get any  feelings from it, it's usually the feeling that I am about to regurgitate  my last meal. In particular, the song &quot;I Won't Hold You Back&quot;  makes me feel especially queasy. Overall, this is a pretty bad CD. But even  today, I do admit to having a certain fondness for &quot;Rosanna&quot; and  &quot;Africa.&quot; That probably has more to do with nostalgia than  anything else, though.
0671042858|4.0|Stephen King's book, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is very good because it gave a good description of the woods, it created a sense of fear, and the ending was satisfying.  Throughout the entire book the woods are  described, and King tells how the girl, Trisha, felt.  &quot;Trisha was  willing to leave sight of the brook if the clenches of trees and tangles of  bushes near it got too thick, but she refused to leave the sound of  it.&quot;  King also created a deep sense of fear.  &quot;You won't even  get inbarned because they're never going to find you.  You'll die out here,  just wander around in these woods until you die.&quot;  The ending was  satisfying.  It was worked in perfectly and the girl survives.  I like  Stephen King.  He has written many great books and this is just one of  those that should be a classic.
B00003Q43A|2.0|When Devlin and Emmerlich made this movie, it was their intention to make a serious movie. And they failed miserably. What they ultimately ended up doing instead was make a satire of the 1953 movie War of The Worlds. Of  course this was not their intention. Their intention was to make a serious  sci-fi movie. <br />I know that there are a lot of people out there who hate  this movie just as much as I do. My advice? Watch the 1953 War of the  Worlds. My prediction is that the more you hate Independence Day, the more  you will like War of the Worlds.
0783211856|5.0|I watched Schindler's List as part of a required class. I didn't have much interest in it before; like other movies I'd seen reviews of, I thought it looked interesting and that I might want to see it sometime.     But now  after watching it, I can say without hesitation that it was one of the best  films I have ever seen. Not only was the quality itself good, but the story  and its portrayal was very moving.     The ability to make a deeply  touching movie is sometimes lost in our culture, but I think that Spielburg  has undoubtedly made his mark with this masterpiece. I found myself wanting  to cry as I witnessed the plight of the Jews. I felt intense anger at  Geothe for his heartless treatment of his fellow humans.     The ability to  empithize with the characters must be in any movie in order for it to be  called great. Schindler's List is a classic, pure and simple. It is  heart-wreching and thought provoking, yet is not without touches of humor  and lightheartedness.     Some might dispute the violence of the film,  calling it too graphic. But I think that its graphic nature is the most  important element. This film is designed to show what the Holocaust was  truly like; how terrible it really was. If the violence was removed, the  original goal would have been lost.     Only through being shown the true  evil and cruely that humans are capable of, and what they have done, can we  be sure not to allow history to repeat itself.
0767817478|1.0|I am 29 years old and I have been watching Godzilla movies ever since I was a little boy. And I can tell you that despite the title of this 1998 Devlin-Emmerlich movie, Godzilla does not appear in this movie. Oh, there's  a creature that we are supposed to believe is Godzilla, but trust me, it's  not Godzilla. This is one of the five worst movies that I have ever seen in  my life. <br />Fortunately, several of the real Godzilla movies are curetnly  available on DVD, and you can purchase them from amazon.com. &quot;Godzilla  King of the Monsters&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; are both  currently on DVD and I recommend them both. And I am hoping that  &quot;Ghidrah the Three Headed Monster&quot; will be issued on DVD soon.  But whatever you do, please, out of respect for the real Godzilla, keep  away from this horrible 1998 film!
B000002AVF|5.0|IF you really don't have this CD your really missing out! This is her best album ever! I have it playing 24/7 at my house. I love it and I know you will to, even if your not a Mariah fan. Every song is a hit (Daydream  Interlude is a mix but it is great). Buy it now!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|LONDON CALLING by the Clash may very well be my favorite album of all time, and it's definitely one of my five favorites. One of the things that amazes me about this album is how from the very beginning all the way  through to the very end, it never lets up. There's no drop in quality. The  greatness that begins with the first song is carried out through the entire  album. It just amazes me. There are so many other albums that start out  strong with the first song or two or three, only to disappoint with  mediocre songs later on. But LONDON CALLING is different, because it holds  up all the way through.<br />So what kind of music is this exactly? Well, the  main component here is punk. But there's also reggae. And there are other  kinds of music here, too, although I'm not sure exactly how to categorize  them. Everything is all mixed up and blended together. It's amazing that  they could take so many different styles of music and combine them all  together like that.<br />It's also amazing that this is a *double* album and  it still manages to be so consistently good from start to finish. This CD  is a true bargain. I have owned this CD for a decade, and I still get a  tremendous amount of enjoyment from it. It may very well be my favorite  album of all time.
B0000026HB|5.0|The Bernstein recording is on the face of it controvertial for having a German Falstaff in Fischer-Dieskau. But why should it be so? FD points the words more intelligently and meaningfully than, for example, Valdengo on  the Toscanini set(recently reissued in quite decent sound). The orchestra  plays with superb panache for Bernstein whose speed is closer to Tosci's  than the competition's--Solti, Karajan, Giulini. But for all the speed, the  phrasing is magnificently nuanced and the whole is buoyant from start to  finish. Not a single cast member lets the interpretation down. So as a  totality this greatest of all Verdi masterpieces tingles and in its  component parts fizzes along with sprightly life affirming  joy.Fischer-Dieskau does not sound heavy or Teutonic. He is both  Shakespearean and Verdian all at once. So in a small but excellent field of  contenders the Bernstein set is at the very least first among equals, and  for my money, the supreme achievement of Bernstein's operatic career.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I just saw this movie for the first time ever. I must say that I was very impressed! The story was very interesting, and the plot really held my attention. The characters were very well done, and the acting was superb. I  know that this is based on some old Shakespear play, but hey, I never  really cared for his stuff. But this movie is fantastic!<br />The thing that  surprised me the most was the special effects. They were amazing. The sets  and vehicles and backgrounds all looked so well done. It's hard to believe  that this film was made nearly half a century ago. One of the good things  about the special effects is that the movie didn't focus on the effects.  Instead, the effects were simply treated as if they were natural occurences  and so nobody really paid any attention to them. The special effects were a  part of the film, but they were not the film itself.<br />I could tell that  this movie is a big influence on many later to come sci-fi things. For  example, I could see big pieces of Star Trek and Star Wars, and also some  elements of 2001 and Lost in Space. <br />But the main reason that I will be  watching this movie again and again is because of the story. This is the  kind of film that really makes you think. The story drags you in right  away. It really held my attention.<br />The picture quality on this DVD is  excellent. The colors are stong and bold, without ever being overbright or  intrusive. And the letterbox presentation does a fine job of showing the  film in the format that it was intended to be seen.
B00000258J|5.0|This is not only the best LP Muddy ever made, it's also probably one of the best blues albums ever, period. Even at the end of his career, Muddy still had &quot;it,&quot; and on this album he was backed by one of his  best bands ever, including Johnny Winter, Bob Margolin and James Cotton,  who blows some incredible harp. This has more &quot;guts&quot; to it than  just about any blues album you could ever hope to hear, and on top of all  of that it's budget priced to boot. Just buy this, you'll see what I mean!
B0000009OU|5.0|Costello's first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, was perfect. His second album, THIS YEAR'S MODEL, is even better. On this album, all of the sexual tension that had been built up on his debut gets released. Just take a look at the  song titles. This album is very much about sex. Fortunately, Costello is  literate enough that he doesn't have to stoop to using graphic language.  Instead, he uses all sorts of similies and metaphors. This album just  explodes with energy. Also, this album serves as a wonderful transition  from his first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, to his third album, ARMED FORCES.
0964385619|5.0|I purchased the book as a result of seeing the author on Oprah on Apr. 28th.  I sat in the parking lot and read half of the book before I even got home.<br />I have read some of the negative reviews and I would like you to know that in some parts I agree with them, However, I feel the book has  great information inspite of those criticisms.  <br />Definitely buy the book.   If you don't like how he completes some of his transactions, then you  don't have to do that but don't cheat yourself of the good, practical  information he has to share.  <br />The book definitely opened my mind and  changed my mindset with respect to money, If for no other reason the book  was worth it.<br />I have been in the process of educating myself about  money/finance prior to hearing of Mr. Kiyosaki and this book helped to  bring into perspective some of the principals I have been reading about.    <br />The book is an easy read and it does not boggle the mind with difficult  to understand financial concepts.  A beginner would not be overwhelmed.<br />A  book definitely worth the price. <br />Happy Reading!
B000000OAN|4.0|This album is a little more whimsical than the follow up &quot;A Day at  the Races&quot; and I must say that it is not as powerful. Still, that is  only to say that this album falls a little short of one of the best rock  albums of the seventies. So, it is still a great piece of work.<br />The  musical content ranges from the traditional rock of &quot;I'm in love with  my car&quot; to the pseudo opera of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; which was  deservedly one of the top ten selling singles of the seventies in the UK.  On the way, they take in ballads and even, in &quot;Good Coompany&quot;  they sound a little like the Bonzos with a light thirites meets modern  feel.<br />The great thing about the album is that all of the songs are good,  I never feel the urge to skip a track when I listen to this.<br />Because it  is very similar to &quot;ADATR&quot;, you may prefer to sample some of the  band's other work rather than buy this one if you already have that  album.<br />Like many other albums that are released on CD, the record company  seems to have felt the need to add some sort of bonus material. Here we get  remixes of &quot;I'm in Love With My Car&quot; and &quot;You're My Best  Friend&quot; which really add nothing to the original recordings.
B00004STPT|5.0|As I watched this film (late April 2k screening), I was stunned by the excellent scoring and the sheer joy of hearing the composer quote &quot;Mars&quot; in scenes of battle.  It wasn't until the end credits that  I knew the composers were Zimmer and Gerrard.  The audience reaction  (applause) to their credit equaled that of dir. Scott and actor Crowe.   <br />This is the sort of score that makes one appreciate the challenge of  capturing and augmenting the raw emotion and power of a film.  <br />My only  complaint about the CD is the lack of the end-credits composer  &quot;stretch&quot; - something missing on far too many score CD's.  With  ~61 mins of music on the CD, there was more than enough room to include  it.<br />Highly recommended!  I bought it twice -- couldn't wait for it to  show up from UPS, so I went out and got it...  now I have one for safe  keeping!  :)
080017948X|5.0|What would you do if you lived forever? How about if you just lived the same day, over-and over? This is the premise for the brilliantly done &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />Phil (Bill Murray), a disenchanted Television  Weatherman, finds himself stuck once again, in Puxatawny (sp?)PA on  Groundhog's Day. Only this year he gets more than he bargains for. For  whatever reason (not very important), Murray wakes up every morning to find  it is Groundhog Day again. During his single day of life, Phil falls in  love with Andie MacDowell, who of course wants nothing to do with the  shallow, self-centered Phil.<br />In the end, Phil realizes that orchestrating  a love affair with MacDowell is not going to work. It is then that he  begins to grow as a person and becomes quite likeable. <br />I enjoy this  movie very much and watch it several times a year. More movies should be  made like this.
6304708521|4.0|This is a totally underappreciated piece of filmmaking.  The opening magical mystery tour montage is worthy of any art film. and, that midget was very cool. But, what is perhaps the best bit of the film (come to think  of it, there are two)<br />the bit with the spaghetti<br />and i am the  walrus.<br />those two things are reasons enough for you to buy this treat for  the eyes.   just make sure to look not to your left but to your right when  you watch this bizarre wonder that is MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.<br />ps: the dream  bit is also great because you see Ms. Winters in a brassiere.  Oh, mercy.
B00000K0DT|5.0|&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; is an unbelievable film, full of intrigue, misdirection and suspense. The casting is just fantastic and as always, Kevin Spacey (Best Supporting Actor as Verbal Kint) shines. <br />Remember the  end of Casablanca? When the Policeman tells a subordinate to &quot;round up  the usual suspects&quot;? Well, here they are five criminals with nothing  in common. Or so they thought. Keyser Sose knows the truth though.<br />The  plot for this movie is one of the best I have ever witnessed. Full of dark  characters and twists, it is guaranteed to entertain and baffle. I only  wish I had selective amnesia, so I could watch the movie over and over  again like the first time.<br />You can't go wrong with &quot;The Usual  Suspects.&quot; It will surely withstand multiple viewings.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is the greatest cd I've ever owned. I just love their music and their songs are great. I never listened to punk before I found Blink and now I'm all over it. I love them so much and this is their best cd by far including  Chesire Cat!
B000002NJS|5.0|K, first things first, this is not a techno nor an electronica CD! And Madonna is not the Queen of Electronica, you make it sound like she invented the style or something! This is a POP album first and foremost,  with 'hints' of electronica. You want electronica, go to a rave or a club,  'cause you ain't gonna find it here. What you do find here though is a  great POP album, classic actually. From 'Drowned World/Substitute For Love'  on, Madonna opens up her world to us for the first time in her music. The  song is beautiful, melancholy and remorseful, wonderfully arranged and  produced. Speaking of producation, this album owes every ounce of its  creativity to Willaim Orbit, the mastermind behind the whole project. There  is no way that without him, Madonna would have been able to produce such a  great POP CD. 'Swim', 'Candy Perfume Girl' and 'Shanti/Ashtangi' are the  only down points on the CD, the rest are pure gold. 'Skin' is kickin',  closest the CD comes to true electronica. 'Sky Fits Heaven' is great, love  listening to it over and over again. 'Frozen' is beautiful, the harmonies,  the strings, everything are great! 'The Power Of Good-Bye' is alright, a  bit sappy. 'To Have And Not To Hold' is great as is 'Mer Girl' a song about  the letting go of her dead mother's spirit. This is an inspiring CD, worth  listening to over and over again, you will not be disapointed. Five Out Of  Five.
0790729628|5.0|I really like the way this film blurs the distinction between human and machine, and seems to beg the question, &quot;So if a human is no different then a machine, then what makes a human human?&quot; The film subtly  responds, &quot;It is the complex interaction and relationship between  these machines that make them more&quot;. You could probably pull the  thread of a number of underlying themes. <br />The Vangelis soundtrack is also  my all time favorite. The music swells and glistens and is rich with  texture and subtle sound effects. It actually adds to the environmental  atmosphere of the film and is very effective even without the visuals.  <br />Personally I think the film is strong enough that both the original  release and the Director's Cut are just as good. I do like the slightly  darker feel and ending in the Director's Cut. I find the narrative a bit  unnecessary and distracting. However, as one other reviewer mentioned the  original release has more of a vintage 40's noir feel due to the narrative.  Either way this film is brilliant. Watch it a few times to fully appreciate  it. <br />It is too bad the DVD release doesn't take the opportunity to  include extras. To make up for it pick up a copy of the book &quot;Film  Noir: The Making of Blade Runner&quot; by Paul M. Sammon&quot;.
0062502182|4.0|The _Alchemist_ is, in my opinion, a deeply religious text. This is because the idea of a &quot;universal language&quot; that Coelho's presents,  which is so central to the story, lies at the core of virtually all of the mystical-spiritual traditions of the world.  <br />In the  _Alchemist_ this is illustrated through the evolution of the protagonist's  inner dialogue with his Heart and his outer dialogue with the Cosmos. In  the various spiritual traditions, this dual discourse reveals the Divine  speech to humans from within (the Heart/Microcosm) and without (the  Cosmos/Macrocosm). Both of these dialogues are made possible simply by  listening which is itself precipitated by silence. In Santiago's case, his  life as a shepard accords him this oppurtunity; his general seclusion from  people and their every-day idle chatter allows him to refine his  internally-intuitive and externally-perceptive sensitivities. One of the  fruits of this refinement is that he learns the language of the World. That  is to say that he begins to recognise the meaning of World's disclosure  around him. Apparently random events begin to acquire a profound  significance, while Nature itself begins to speak to him. The truth however  is that the Cosmos and his Heart were always speaking to him, its just that  now he's learned the language by which they communicate. <br />The sufis  (Muslim-mystics) used to say: &quot;It was only after man became ignorant  of the greater Koran that God revealed the lesser Koran&quot;. What they  meant was that the Cosmos is a Sacred Book, but only after the language of  this Text was forgotten were the &quot;lesser Korans&quot; (actual literal  books) made necessary in order to understand the Divine Speech. This idea  of the World as a Book is also found in the Liber Mundi of the Rose-Croix,  the Apocalyptic symbol of the Liber Vitae, as well as in Hinduism and  Taoism where the Cosmos is viewed as the prototype/archetype of the actual  sacred books of thetradition. <br />The point here being that in these varous  traditions there is testimony to a universal and non-phonetic language  which binds us all together into a Unity or Oneness. This is clearly  revealed in the story by the Catholic Santiago's deeply felt sense of  affinity with the desert Muslims. What brings them together into this  hermeneutical-union -- this interpretive-bond -- where they both understand  the Sacred Language of the World and the Heart, is the Universal Religion  which lies above and beyond their &quot;formal&quot; religious  allegiances.<br />The point of my review is simply to reveal that inside the  deceptively simple story-line of the _Alchemist_ lies the quintessential  truth of the all the Sacred Religions, ie that of an Ultimate and  All-Embracing Unity. To see this in Coeliho's work is to see the world in  the grain of sand. <br />For further reading I suggest Attar's fascinating  book, _The Conference of the Birds_. There is an actual allusion to it in  the _Alchemist_ when one of the characters refers to the &quot;language of  the birds&quot;.
B000002HPV|5.0|I agree that Bjork is one of the most innovative and brave musicians of our time. She strikes me as the Mother Teresa of electronica/pop. I get the feeling that Bjork may one day become a household name. She is just too brilliant and focused to be otherwise ignored. Homogenic is yet another step into new territory for music of any kind. Somehow each of her albums is better than the last to me, but they are all excellent. Homogenic is simple in concept yet rich and detailed musically. She gets away with complexity, abstraction and atonality in her music without distracting or insulting the listener. She's also not afraid to try anything. She's performed live with string quartets, accordion, a wine glass musician, you name it. And it is always affective. Homogenic is no different; it's expansive and original. This is just beautiful classy music by a very intelligent and classy talent. I admire Bjork greatly and consider her one of the greatest musicians/spirits of our time.
B000000OTU|5.0|This album just blows me away.  Every single track on it is a true hit.  It is a testiment to the band's strength that they managed to have so many hits on the second time around.  Even the two previously unreleased tracks,  Walk On Water and Blind Man, became hits themselves.  Wow.
6305807426|5.0|If you're into the atmosphere of the world of horror, this is the flick for you. The music...the set designs...the premise..everything takes you into the most dreamy of the genre. This film is even more fairy tale-like  than Suspiria, which of course is another great Dario flick.  This is the  most dreamy, ambient, vibey, gothic, colour cascaded, trippy, at times  shocking, and yes possibly,  esoteric film I have ever seen. I am torn  between deciding if the world of inferno is the perfect version of Hell, or  of Heaven. And Emerson's score tossed in with some Verdi....simply  brilliant.
6305657947|4.0|Let me just start off by saying that Pierce Brosnan is one of my favorite actors.  I love this movie and him in it.  Lots of twists and turns.  Keeps you thinking.  Rene Russo is hot in this movie.  Real Hot.  The interactive  menu is really put together nicely.  And the trailer of the original makes  you want to get that to.

6305696071|4.0|I never really looked at this movie until I got it on DVD for my girlfriend.  Nice story and good acting.  The added background info about the production of the movie is cool.
6304698623|5.0|ok.  i'm a guy.  and i watch this film.  and i cry.  this has happened several times.  i hate it.  and i still watch the film.<br />on dvd, the colors and cinematography pop out beautifully.  gorgeous.  also, the music  sounds lush and engulfing.<br />i missed this film at the movies.  wish i  hadn't.  first, i think the movie would be experienced better on the big  screen.  second, i would love hollywood to get the message to make more  films like this (well acted, well written, well thought out, etc.)  of  course, the downside would be walking out of the theater with those tears  streaming down my face.<br />not a real guy thing to do.
B00000JL86|4.0|I bought this movie because I've been interested in the mystery of the Grand Duchess Anastasia since I was a kid, not because I have rugrats. This movie was entertaining. Anya is a spunky heroine; Dimitri is a scrappy  hero; they have a sweet and surprisingly adult romance and the plot is more  realistic (except for the ridiculous villain Rasputin) than expected. There  is a lovely, melancholy song called &quot;Once Upon a December&quot; that  the amnesiac Anya sings in the empty palace as ghosts come out of paintings  to dance with her. This movie isn't historically accurate, but it's a  satisfying fairy tale -- the way we wish it had been.
0140434135|5.0|This was excellent!  I would recommend this book to any young person who is able to follow sometimes, difficult reading.  Jane Austen told the tale wonderfully and explained every thought and feeling vividly and emotionally.
0684857219|4.0|Ok it's not the bible, but it has renewed my desire to bodybuild.  The book has three levels of exercise programs, three levels of diet programs, and some general diet advice.  The book also has advice for competitions, and a considerable list of exercises (with pictures).  There are also  &quot;Advanced&quot; tips for bodybuilders, like &quot;21's&quot; for  curls.... intense, but rewarding!   I would recomend this book to anyone  who is starting out, or those like me who are starting again.  Some of the  exercises may be outdated (which is why the book recomends reading the  latest info; bodybuilding is a relatively new &quot;sport&quot;).  It's  relatively cheap for what could be the centerpiece of physical fitness  during the rest of your life.
0767819594|3.0|I'm not the first to say that I disagree with some of the reviews saying that this is the greatest film of all time. Give me a break. But hey... it sure is fun to watch. Basing my opinions on this movie on what I saw and  not on what I did NOT see (Dangerous Liasons) completely leans toward all  fairness for writer/director Kumble. Artsy reviewers who didn't like this  film compare it to the &quot;superior&quot; Malkovich one. Alone, the movie  certainly appeals to a general audience: teeny boppers. Yes, teeny boppers.  Purveyors of the successes of such box-office smashes as Scream, I Know  What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty, etc. I'm 18, so it's  not like I don't qualify. Liking artsy movies such as the Godfather,  Chinatown, Casablanca, etc. probably won't justify my review as an  intelligent one, but oh well. Cruel Intentions is a sexy satire on  upper-class teens in the 90's. Maybe the &quot;big words&quot; is overdoing  it sometimes, and certain scenes seem unnecassery. Like when Selma Blair  and Sarah Michelle Gellar share an intimate tongue kiss, with the camera  panning 2 inches away from the salivating action. It's not like I'm  complaining. That's probably my favorite scene of the movie (I'm an 18 year  old male), but did it really belong? Overall, a very enjoyable movie with a  twisted plot, but with mediocre acting and scenes that just seem to go on  too long. Judge for yourself. Worth the money, I guess. But if you haven't  seen it yet, I reccommend you rent it before you spend your hard-earned 15  bucks to own it.
0812550706|5.0|Having read Ender's Game a little over a year ago, I can still remember staying up until 3AM begging for &quot;only a few more minutes! &quot;<br />This is a true example of how science-fiction should be written.  The entire plot fits together, although the main character (Ender) seemed suspiciously like an adult in a 6-year old's body.  But  anyone who questions ender is a fool.  I've heard arguments that he is a  brilliant tactician, yet gets beat up so it doesn't make sense.  WRONG. A  brilliant tactician doesn't need to be a built up mud-slugger.  that's what  grunts are for.<br />Easily in the Top 3 science fiction books with only Dune  (of course, what else) and 2001: Space Odyssey above it.
B0000028UK|5.0|This has to be the number 1 best in the my pearl jam collection, and i have them all. The Groove on every song is so awesome. Glorified G and rearviewmirror are my favorites on the album. I cant wait till Bianuaral  comes out!
B00003W8NM|5.0|...Hollywood could ever hope to make, Fight Club pushes envelopes like a busy mailroom. This is a movie that, ultimately, is a vicious and fun attack on capitalism--usually the subject matter of scrappy indie films,  but not so here. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton have great chemistry--the former  being a revolutionary thoughtful AND sadistic at the same time, the latter  doing his best to drop out of his meaningless corporate life (itself filled  with violence--he checks gruesome car accidents to see whether to raise  insurance rates) with fists flying.  Literally.  Yes, this is an incredibly  violent movie, but the violence isn't senseless--the director and the  actors use violence as a tool to smash easy assumptions about basic  constructions of the everyday reality of American life.  Take this for what  you will, disagree with the film even--but Fight Club forces the viewer at  the very least to challenge his or her own thought process, in a clever,  visceral, sometimes outrageous way.There are so many amazing aspects about  this film that its hard to pin this one down or that one--the great  supporting cast that includes Helena Bonham Carter as a &quot;support group  tourist&quot; and Meat Loaf as a guy with, er, breasts, in his best role  since Rocky Horror.  In this film, you'll find out why a penguin is Ed  Norton's character's spirit animal, the strange origin of soap, how  gruesome the safety instructions for an airplane can be and...well, I'll  stop there.  See the movie, be impressed by how a Hollywood film can  actually break the odds and actually mean something greater than the sum of  its parts.
B000002UKS|5.0|This is gotta be song to song their best so far. 'There's nothing to lose is good' also, but this just knocks it out of the water. This is a big step up from the first album which was nothing special. Personal favorites on  this album are ' Hey Johnny Park' and 'new way home'
B00004SYWZ|3.0|The first vital sign from a-ha since 1993's commercial flop &quot;Memorial beach&quot;, their comeback album simply should have been better. It sounds too much like 'middle-of-the-road' and, overall, it lacks the  straightforward songs and memorable melodies of earlier a-ha albums.  &quot;Minor earth..&quot; features this typical, radio-friendly  electro-rock style of the late-'90s: Technical virtuosity and great vocal  delivery squandered in the presence of pointless rhythm loops, whiny string  arrangements, and slick production. Some sparks come with the surprisingly  rocky title track and the first single &quot;Summer moved on&quot;. The  other tracks are not bad, but they just don't touch me. Even if it's cool  that a-ha are back, I think all their '80s stuff is better than this  mediocre affair.

B00000K2SC|5.0|WOW!   This has to be one of the most exciting and brilliant sci-fi movies to come out in the last few years.  It starts out fast, the action taking you for a ride, and it slows down just enough when Morpheus(Fishburne)  first begins to explain to Neo(Reeves) about what the Matrix is and how it  works.  This movie was put together very well, and the martial arts scenes  showed a lot of time and effort was put into them.  I can't wait for Matrix  2.

B00004SVID|5.0|This live recording of The Wall, played before a packed house at Earl's Court, breathes fresh life into the awesome, yet arguably sterile, studio album, [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall (Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered)]]. Though \\"Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live\\" rarely strays from the studio rendition, Pink Floyd let loose in some spots, especially guitarist David Gilmour. Plus, all the background noise heard on the album -- the phones ringing, people yelling, women chattering, screams -- sounds crystal clear and invigorating in concert. Curiously, the crowd is mostly subdued throughout, indicating Floyd treated this as a mixture of a play and a rock concert. It's possible that the band's adoring fans showed a great  deal of respect, restraint and even a bit of awe at what they were witnessing.<br /><br />What's accentuated on this stellar recording is the magnificent vocal interplay between Roger Waters and Gilmour. Whatever their problems offstage, these guys worked fluently and harmonically as they sang separately or together within \\"The Wall's\\" songs. Waters, despite his need to always take credit for everything Floyd did in its latter years, needed top musicians like Gilmour to pull off this stunning and elaborate set.<br /><br />Here's a recap of highlights on this album:<br /><br />* The funny and urgent \\"Master of  Ceremony\\" beginning<br />* The chilling start of \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II),\\" plus the  drawn-out guitar solo at the end<br />* The added-on track, \\"What Shall We Do Now,\\" which was also featured in the movie<br />* The haunting and expertly played \\"Is There Anybody Out There,\\" which  features cool TV background noises that differ from the studio album<br />* The extended solo at the end of \\"Comfortably Numb\\"<br />* The intense and revved-up start to \\"Run Like Hell,\\" where the normally placid Waters goes wild<br />* The barber shop rendition of \\"Outside the Wall\\"<br />* The excellent singing, keyboards and drumming throughout<br />* The lucky crowd who got to watch all this<br /><br />Finally, the informative CD booklet, which feature insights and information about this live performance from the major players involved, is a real treat for fans.<br /><br />What more can be said? If you already love the studio version of \\"The Wall,\\" this album won't disappoint.this     Finally, the informative CD booklet, which feature insights and information about this live performance from the major players involved, is a real treat for fans.

B00001NFCY|4.0|I joined a band recently and I was asked to learn a lot of the new rock that is out... things like Godsmack, Fuel and the like.  The music is ok, but really didn't do anything for me.  I had to learn 3 Creed songs, so I  picked up the CD expecting more of the same. I can't express how happy I am  with this cd. Edgy but smart with an almost uplifting theme to it.  It is  like Alice in Chains but it doesn't put you in an angry mood when you're  done listening to it.  Bands like Creed give me faith that rock is not  dead.  Pick up this CD if you already haven't, I think you will be happy.

6305095566|5.0|Ok this movie has so much goo in it is kind of ridiculous, but it's greattt. LEt me think of some of the best partz, pencil to tha ankel(GREAT), doors that smash tha fingerz of a monsta. Milk, mashed  potatoes, and black blod spray out of people. Yes! you heard right, I said  milk and mashed potatoes! They astrat spiiting out milk(it's probably not  supposed to be milk but the budget was so low they didn't know how else to  do it) and mashed potatoes con food coloring sprayed out too, so gross. The  special effex are horrible. El movie es greeeeeeaaaattttt. Pretty greasu  movie for a greasy mullet of Bruce Campbell. Buy the 2nd one too, it is  even better. IT is so funny, this one isn't. But it is good. There is also  Army O' DArkness, but that is kind of awful. Buy this movie if you like  ghetto movies! I'm out like a light that got ran over by a bulldozer.

B00000FC5H|4.0|Earth,Wind,and Fire is a great band.I just wish that &quot;Head to the sky&quot; was on here. I don't know how in the world he does it,but Phillip Bailey can sing a lot higher than most men who sing tenor.It's true! It's  true! He can sing in the Mariah Carey soprano range and beyond. Don't  believe me? Listen to the end of &quot;Head to the sky&quot; and  &quot;Mighty Mighty&quot; .His voice is so unreal. I don't see how in the  world he streches his voice so high.Yes,he has Michael Jackson and Prince  laying in the dust. But anyway,this is a great CD.EWF is a funky band!  I  recommend it.
6302038308|5.0|What a greasy movie! so good, so good. So much goo, so much goo. So funny, Bruce Campbell is HIGHLY underrated acttor. This movie has so much MEAT that yoou may begin to crave bloody goo. The best part is when the girl  eats the eyeball and the guy gets lightbulb to tha dome. My gosh I laughed  so hard at this movie. So you, the uneducated buyer of B Gradez may ask in  a british voice, &quot;IS THIS A COMEDY?&quot; Well, not exactly, &quot;IS  IT SCARY?&quot; no not at all! &quot;IS IT  GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTT?&quot; Yes very much so  so good in fact I now have a Bruce Campbell mullet to show my appreciation  everywhere I go. Buy this, then buy Pieces, then buy Jack Frost, no no no  not tha Michael Keaton one! the one about the snowman who rips people's  domez off. Back to ED2, buy it, ok the guy gets a chainsaw for an arm,there  is mad goo, what more could ya want. I'm out...
B000002BVN|3.0|Michael isn't a smooth singer anymore.Starting around the &quot;Victory&quot; &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Dangerous&quot; albums,he stopped singing in his trademark tenor voice and actually started  screaming.Plus,he changed his music style.&quot;Off the wall&quot;was pure  disco and soul.&quot;Thriller&quot; involved rock,soul,R/B,and about every  good music genre.But around the &quot;Bad&quot; time period,he quit singing  smooth ballads and started shouting the lyrics. Sometimes I feel like he is  angry and screaming at me!He needs to stop remixing his old songs,improve  his singing,and leave the hard rock stuff alone. Michael has lost his  trademark Superstardom.This album shows just how much Michael has changed  since the mid-eighties musically.

B000002UTK|3.0|&quot;Introspective&quot; positioned the PSB in the Euro-dance firmament (ie, made them the most successful pop duo of the late-'80s), but it lacks exactly the finesse, consistency, and understated drama that made the  subsequent album &quot;Behavior&quot; so engaging. A collection of six  extended remix versions of previously released songs,  &quot;Introspective&quot; shouldn't be a surprise, and where the tracks  last up to 9 1/2 minutes, the duo inevitably falls into repetition and  rather formulaic rhythm patterns. A typical album allied to the acid  house/Euro-dance scene of the late-'80s, featuring long instrumental  passages, catchy rhythms, and dynamic production, it's designed for the  dancefloor, not for home listening. &quot;Domino dancing&quot;, one of  PSB's best songs ever, shows their fascination with Latin rhythms and  bright horn arrangements. &quot;I'm not scared&quot; was originally written  by Chris and Neil for Euro-dance band Eighth Wonder, scoring a #1 hit in  Italy. The mix of &quot;Always on my mind&quot; is slightly different to  that on the original 12&quot; release. Only &quot;I want a dog&quot;  actually annoys, the other tracks are both danceable and pretty. Well, as  long as you want to have the original, short versions of the songs,  &quot;Discography&quot; is a far better purchase. After all, I think  &quot;Introspective&quot; is o.k., but it doesn't stand out among the disco  music of the late-'80s, and PSB's contemporaries like New Order and  S-Express already had begun to experiment with a more progressive sound  that eventually would become today's techno music.
B000003BEM|5.0|Though The Stones recording were well-revered at the time,Beggars Banquet is where this group shows they can reach the next level of musical progression.Coming after the ill concieved,yet quirkily brilliant  psychedelic foray Their Satanic Majesties Request,they come out with BB  which brings them back in touch with their blues roots as well as open new  doors.Sympathy For The Devil and Street Fighting Man must of been a shock  to the ears of ill prepared listeners who  soaked up the non album preview  single Jumping Jack Flash.But its also songs like No Expectations,Jigsaw  Puzzle,Stray Cat Blues &amp; Salt Of The Earth that fortifies this albums  classic stature.Factory Girl,Prodigal Son and Parachute Woman makes you  wish they'd return to this genre today instead of using their music to  promote their concerts.At the time when most groups were spewing out SGT  Pepper rip-offs or even falling apart(Cream and even The Beatles  themselves)The Rolling Stones were ready to take the mantle,and Beggars  Banquet was their first victory.
B000024D4R|5.0|Sere breve, este disco es el mejor disco de PINK FLOYD desde mi opinion personal, ( se que es dificil quedarse con uno peor bueno ), la energia de este disco es desbordande y el juego de &quot;Juez&quot; que toma waters es  interesante, la division del mundo en CERDOS, PERROS y BORREGOS es muy  buena, la guitarra de Gilmour es fantastica y la volcalizacion de Waters  llega a su punto mas alto......un disco fundamental para ver el camino que  PF tomaria en sus siguientes 2 discos (the Wall y the Fianl Cut)
0380018179|5.0|The Thorn Birds, by Colleen McCullough, begins in 1915 and spans three generations long. It is a complex story about the Cleary family that leave their home in New Zealand to live and work on a relative's extensive,  Australian sheep ranch.  At the ranch, the family experiences many  tragedies and hardships including fires, floods, droughts, and devastating  deaths of loved ones.  The main character, Meggie, falls madly in love with  a handsome man named Ralph.  Unfortunately, Meggie is not able to marry  Ralph because he is a priest. Ralph loves Meggie dearly, but has devoted  his entire life to God.  Throughout the novel, they experience great love  and sorrow together.  Meggie has children who become the third generation  of the novel.  The children bring her much happiness, but she still has a  deep passion for Ralph in her heart.  This forbidden love for Ralph will  stay burning inside her soul throughout her entire life.<br />I truly enjoyed  how the author used a lot of description and detail in the novel.  This  description enabled me to paint vivid pictures of the beautiful, Australian  land in my mind, as well as clear pictures of the many different  characters' inner and outer appearances. <br />This extraordinary love story  was like an emotional rollercoaster.  It twisted and turned leaving me  feeling many different emotions including love, humor, sadness, anger,  hate, and malice. I often found myself crying as well as laughing while I  eagerly devoured every word on the page.  It kept me reading and reading  until the very interesting ending.  I would recommend this captivating  novel to anyone who is looking for a great story about life and love! I'm  sure you will enjoy it just as much as I did!

At the ranch, the family experiences many  tragedies and hardships including fires, floods, droughts, and devastating  deaths of loved ones.  The main character, Meggie, falls madly in love with  a handsome man named Ralph.  Unfortunately, Meggie is not able to marry  Ralph because he is a priest. Ralph loves Meggie dearly, but has devoted  his entire life to God.  Throughout the novel, they experience great love  and sorrow together.  Meggie has children who become the third generation  of the novel.  The children bring her much happiness, but she still has a  deep passion for Ralph in her heart.  This forbidden love for Ralph will  stay burning inside her soul throughout her entire life.<br />I truly enjoyed  how the author used a lot of description and detail in the novel.  This  description enabled me to paint vivid pictures of the beautiful, Australian  land in my mind, as well as clear pictures of the many different  characters' inner and outer appearances. <br />This extraordinary love story  was like an emotional rollercoaster.  It twisted and turned leaving me  feeling many different emotions including love, humor, sadness, anger,  hate, and malice. I often found myself crying as well as laughing while I  eagerly devoured every word on the page.  It kept me reading and reading  until the very interesting ending.  I would recommend this captivating  novel to anyone who is looking for a great story about life and love! I'm  sure you will enjoy it just as much as I did!
B000002A3T|4.0|Si bien, el primer disco de Pink Floyd sin Waters, no fue de mi completo agrado, este disco recupera parte de lo perdido, el sonido es limpio y nitido, para todos los que amaron el wish you were here, este disco les debe gustar, canciones como &quot;keep Talking&quot; o &quot;high  hopes&quot; nos muestran a un pink floyd parado en la barrera que divide la  locura de lso primeros discos y el perfeccionismo que busco alguna ves en  los 70....un gran disco sin duda alguna
B000021XS0|5.0|Without these guys, and their musical talent, I would have serious concerns about the state of creative talent in the music industry (ie. Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Britney Spears, etc...).  Scenes From a Memory is the  result of a band that will not rest on its laurels, and plans on kicking  out great music for years to come.  After the somewhat disappointing  Falling into Infinity, the DT boys come roaring back with one of their most  solid efforts to date, ranking up there with some of the best  metal/prog-metal concept albums out there...while sticking in true Dream  Theater theme.  Well done!
B00003003R|5.0|Este disco te Escupe en la cara lo mejor de las epocas de gloria de GNR, si esa banda que hoy no quieres aceptar que alguna ves escuchaste, pero que te aprendiste todas als letras, todas las canciones, compraste todos los  discos, viste todos sus videos, tenias todas sus camisas y compraste todas  las revistas donde apareciam bueno este disco te hace recordar porque  consideraste alguna ves a GNR como la banda mas grande: Guitarra Meteorica,  Bateria Fuerte, Un Bajo Potente y una voz desgarradora, eso era GUNS AND  ROSES<br />Pd: Bueno para recordar Las pintas escolares y las primeras locuras  que cometiste
B000001Y42|5.0|This cd was great.  I got significant other before i got three dollar bill ya'll.  I was getting tired of significant other when i found three dollar bill.  It has a lot of great songs that no one has heard of.  Great heavy  music.  I LOVE IT!   IT ROX!
B000001Y5J|5.0|este disco , fue lo primero que escuche de NIN, y sin duda en su epoca (y hoy) me deja maravillado: Un sonido tortuosos, fuerte, catartico, una desgarradora voz, un disco potente, un discazo !  sin Duda que este disco  fue la gran influencia de las bandas que llegarian a mediados de los 90s,  impresionante en el amplio sentido de la palabra
B00000I952|4.0|Here's Abba at their melancholy best, with the  somberness of &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; and &quot;The Winner Takes it All&quot; taking center stage. Still, the serious-sounding &quot;Soldiers&quot; and  &quot;One of Us&quot; are rife with Abba's candy-laced harmonies, and I've  found them to be highly addictive. The album hangs together well and is at  turns brilliantly executed--but &quot;The Visitors&quot; is worthwhile if  for no other reason than to hear &quot;Two For the Price of One.&quot; What  were Benny &amp; Bjorn smoking when they decided to combine a menage a  trois theme with a marching band fanfare?
B000000P17|4.0|Guns And roses a pesar de estar en el genero HARD-ROCK, siempre tuvo influencias PUNK, tanto en idelogias como en actitudes, y este disco muestra el lado PUNK de la banda con clasicos desde los SEX PISTOL hasta IGGY POP, un muy buen trabajo de GNR
0790738139|5.0|L.A. Confidential is that good.  In the echelons of all-time great film noirs, this belongs next to Chinatown and The Big Sleep.  <br />All of the traditional elements of a noir are here -- a gorgeous femme fatale, tough  guys in sharp suits, fist fights, shoot-outs, moral ambivalence, and a  surprise ending.  However, this film also works to update the old prototype  of noirs -- it takes place in the early 1950's (as opposed to the 1930's)  and deals with homosexuality and drug use and other contemporary issues in  a way that few noirs have ever done.  <br />Russel Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin  Spacey, Danny Devito, Kim Basinger, and James Cromwell make up one of the  best ensemble casts I've ever seen in a film.  Not only are they all good  actors, but each of their characters are unique and original.  The  screenplay is an excellent adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, and Curtis  Hanson, who had previously worked as a film critic, did a masterful job  building the tension to a gripping shootout in an abandoned  motel.<br />Watching this film in the theater, I was struck by the film's  attention to detail.  When Characters in the movie shoot a gun, it sounds  as if bullets are flying over your head in the audience, and the  camera-work and framing heightens the suspense by betraying Hollywood  conventions.<br />The best film of 1997.  Titanic's popularity robbed L.A.  Confidential of its Oscar.
B000002UA0|4.0|El Primer disco de PINK FLOYD es obra en un 90% de Syd Barret, co-fundador del grupo junto con Waters, es un dsico desbordande, con magia, locura y una psicodelia a veces acida, a veces divertida, no es el tipico album de  pink floyd (si solo has escuchado los de los 70s), pero es un gran album,  que deja atras los intentos de musica &quot;avanzada&quot; de la epoca (  incluidos los Beatles), Recomendaciones: Astronmy Domine, Intellestar  Overdirive, Pow  R  Toc H
0790729989|5.0|A lot of other reviewers keep comparing Seven to Silence of the Lambs; I think what makes this valid is that, like Lambs, most of the most disturbing imagery in Seven occurs in your own head. Remember the turnkey  showing Clarice the picture of the nurse Lechter bit? We never saw it, and  our salivating imaginations produced a special effect worse than anything  the filmakers could have. In Seven, the worst bits are the decriptions of  Doe's methods and the autopsy results (the actor playing Lust conjures up  Hell on Earth with his account of the tryst with the hooker).        I said  salivating earlier because I think another point of this movie is to make  the viewer address his/her own apathy towards our shared moral decline. On  SOME level, John Doe's perceptions make sense--no, not to the degree that  one would advocate his actions, but his argument with Pitt about &quot;only  in a (blank blank) world like this would these people be called  innocent&quot; had merit. It also questions our opinion about crime and  punishment--the swat team member leaning over the nearly dead pedophile and  telling him he deserved his torture weighs heavy in the chest. I sat up  half the night with a close friend after seeing this and discussed it--we  felt like we had to, just to get it in some logical place in our heads  before we could sleep. I don't think saying I loved this movie is accurate  or appropriate; rather, I appreciated and understood it.
B000000WA4|5.0|WOW !  este disco sin duda es un Viaje, un gran viaje, desde el inicio (calmado pausado) hasta los gritos de rencor de ZERO o BULLET WITH... un disco epopeyico, con todas las matices que se puedan combinar, lleno de  canciones clasicas, que cualquiera ( en su mayoria pues ) pudo ver sido  lanzada como sencillo, rock-Punk-Pop, muy elaborado, con un gran toque de  creatividad, una obra maestra.....
B000024Z5N|4.0|Very heavy. Disregard the negative unknowing , unappreciative comments of some of the reviewers.  Focus was very early in&quot;jazz- fusion&quot;. Relisten to it, as with Emerson. Notice influences. Get Akkerman's and Van  Der lindens solo lps. Hamburger lp live is OK but they were better than  that live.
B000002B35|4.0|Sin dudar mucho este disco es la mejro opcion para la gente &quot;nueva&quot; en el planeta Floyd, te mustra una coleccion de exitos de la banda desde los inicios, hasta los 90s, si faltan muchas canciones, si  no esta roger waters, pero el disco es muy agradable y ademas interptretan  el DARK SIDE OF THE MOON completo !  <br />Buen Disco.....El Mejor En vivo  jamas grabado, impecable, limpio y ejecutado muchas veces, mejor que las  versiones en estudio
6304698526|4.0|An excellent example of late 60s early 70s highly stylized moviemaking.  Includes an unmatched mixture of stark realism along with the type of departure from realism that can only surround a role filled by the  legendary screen presence of Steve McQueen.  This is illustrated by the use  of real doctors and medical procedures through the hospital scenes  contrasted with McQueen's ultra-cool &quot;antihero&quot; character with  the unlikely name of &quot;Lt. Bullitt&quot;.  Beat Dirty Harry by a year  with its theme.  Additionally, no Hollywood composer caught the essence of  late 60s early 70s style in films like Lalo Schifrin (who also did Dirty  Harry), and this film is an excellent example of his work.  Film also  boasts one of the most stylized opening title sequences in film history.   Great entertainment.
B000002NFM|5.0|Wooooooooooooooooooow, eso fue lo que salio de mi al escuchar este disco por completo, wow, si tu eres de las personas que critican a la musica electronica como &quot;Vacia&quot; o &quot;eso no es musica&quot;, POR DIOS  !  no has escuchado este disco, impactante, unos paisanes sonoros muy  elaborados, no es el tupico disco de electronica/dance europeo, aqui la  actitud esta en todas partes, es un viaje muy placentero, los Beats de esta  banda te hacen ver que despues e todo, la tecnologia no esta peleada con la  musica, al contrario la hace evolucionar, BREATHE THE PRESURE MOTHER F#CKER  !
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is a great compilation album it has some of the beatles best songs. It's a must for any Beatles fan.
B000000WJZ|4.0|Este disco muestra el camino de los pumpkins, este disco muestra la combinacion de bladas-rock, ocn estridentes guitarras, ese sonido que los delata, un gran album, de lo mejor de los 90s , sin duda alguna
6304297912|5.0|This is a great movie about a group of scottish heroine addicts. I believe it was one of the top 100 of the BFI (British Film Institute). This is a must see for everybody.
B000002UA5|4.0|Este disco es un disco de &quot;transicion&quot;, del floyd de barret al floyd de waters, si bien el disco en estudio es muy bueno, lleno de efectos sonoros, paisajes escabrosos y psicodelia al maxico, el disco en vivo hace  de este un disco obligatorio, las interpretaciones en directo de la banda  son majestuosas, en especial (y sobre todo) Carefull w/that Axe Eugene, un  gran disco que merece sin duda , un lugar en la coleccion de un BUEN  aficionado de Pink Floyd
B000002UYZ|3.0|It's not my favorite Beatles album but it does have some good songs. I'll have to say that the 1967-1970 album is a lot better.
B000002C1W|3.0|este es el disco de pink floyd que menos me gusta, no por eso es un disco malo, en realidad los solos de guitarra son muy buenos, la cancion &quot;learning To Fly&quot; es magnifica, y la produccion en realidad es buena, el problema es que muchas veces el disco cae en un rock &quot;easy  listening&quot; que en realidad no me agrada mucho viniendo de PF, buen  disco a pesar de todo
B00004LN16|5.0|What can I say? AC/DC are the monsters of rock and show it time and again. Stiff Upper Lip is classic AC/DC: in your face, hard, bluesy, pure rock and roll! Brian Johnson sounds as great as ever, as does Angus on lead guitar.  Rock on!
B0000028M7|5.0|Este disco es el mejor del grunge, y sin duda entraria en mi hipotetica lista de lso TOP 10 de todos los tiempos, el disco esta BRUTAL !  Nunca creo que me cansare de escucharlo, es sin duda de los mejores discos de la  historia.....muy recomendable para los que creian que el grunge era solo  nirvana, esto, es Grunge
0812931017|5.0|This book was a rollercoaster-ride in business, in the history of the last few decades' music and an amazing person's life. I read it in a few days, from cover to cover, and could barely put it down. He writes in a style  that fits his life, it's vivid, fast-paced and interesting. You won't get a  blueprint for a successful business, but an insight into a very successful  mindset. :) I recommend it!
B000002U9W|4.0|Siempre los discos de pink floyd traen un toque en cierto modo Esquizoide, este no se queda atras, la primera &quot;Cancion&quot; (que da nombre al disco), dura +20 minutos, es una obra majestuosa, llena de matices, con un  sonido que viene desde lejoes , se istala es tu subconciente y despues se  aleja (es progresivo despues de todo! ), las otras 4 piezas del disco son:  If (Que muestra el lado oscuro de Waters), Summer 68 (quenos deja claro que  tal ves rick, era el menos enfermo) y Fat Old Sun (de gilmour), cerrando  con un collage indescriptible...muy recomendable
1560689986|5.0|Haha, had you fooled huh.  Well this is perhaps one of the funniest of the Python series and Eric Idel is always hillarious when he sings.  John Cleese's latin lessons to Brian were a riot.  <br />As always the Python  series looks at some issues and attacks them with their quick wit and  parodys.  In this episode the obvious object of their critisims are those  who blindly follow &quot;religious leaders&quot; while placing the  background for the film in Roman occupied Jeruselam.  The story follows the  life of Brian, a young man who at birth was mistaken for the Messiah by the  three wise men to his crucifixtion and Idel's &quot;Look on the Bright  Side&quot; song.   This is a must have for any fan of the Python series or  for someone who just wants a funny movie that is a break from the regular  slapstick comedy of today.
B000002C1V|4.0|Por si la Autocrucifixion practicada pro Waters en el disco anterior (the Wall) nu hubiera sido suficiente, en este disco tenemos mas de lo mismo: Historias de guerra, reclamos del individuo al sistema, sarcasmo y mucha critica al gobierno ingles (y de otros poaises), el sonido de disco es muy  parecido al camino que se habia trasado con The Wall, recomendado para los  incondicionales del grupo y  para los que consideran The Wall el mejor  disco de la banda
0671799320|5.0|Since I chose oil futures as a term paper topic for my graduate investment class, I really wanted to get a strong background on how oil became such a powerful commodity since it was discovered back in the 1800s.  This book gives an in depth history from Standard Oil to OPEC. You see just how  powerful oil is when it comes to politics, and you will understand why our  gasoline prices were approaching $2.00 a gallon in March.  Yergin truly  deserved the Pulitzer Prize for his seven years of research.  This book is  excellent.
B000000OQY|3.0|Un Disco transitorio en la carrera de GNR, La banda toma algunas canciones de sus viejos conciertos, algun covver por ahi y le agrega algunas rolas nuevas, el resultado: LIES un disco para los fans de la banda con clasicos  como PATIENCE y ROQUET QUEEN y excelentes temas como I USED TO LOVE  HER....Un agradable Disco con temas controversiales
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is the best rock cd I ever listened to. After hearing Higher one time, Creed became tied with KoRn as my favorite band. This cd is indescribable. Every song is great. A must in any rock collection. Creed  rules, Creed rules, Creed rules, Creed rules!
B000000OQF|5.0|Este disco es ei inicio de un mito: GUNS AND ROSES. para un servidor la mejor banda de todo el movimiento rockero de la epoca (Motley Crue y otros) esta era LA BANDA , esta banda siemore tuvo ACTITUD , desafiante,  guerrilliera, problematica, siempre hicieron lo que quisieron y les valia  madre tu opinion, este disco esta lleno de referencas a lo mejor del  Hard-Rock Welcome To The Jungle, Paradise City, Y muchas, Muchas mas, Un  Disco Obligado en la historia del rock....
079213690X|5.0|I have found on recent trips to europe, one after the movie was released and the other last year, that the general opinion of the Scotts for the film Braveheart remains to hold high respect.<br />What this says to me is  that the consensus that merits the greatest right to protest historical  inefficiency believes that the movie expressed the right meaning.  Beyond  being a fantastic creation and performance by Mel Gibson - as well as  everyone who played a role, the film provides an oscillating emotional ride  that inspires fear, passion, and a desire in fighting for what you believe.   It is sad, intense, and leaves an impression, that's what we want isn't  it?<br />Life is seen by many and told by many.  This makes life interesting.   Whether it is slightly inaccurate or dogmatic, it is a perception one feels  they should tell to the world.  Can't please everyone.  <br />My advice is  know that Wallace did exist, carry a rediculously large sword (i've seen it  and it still has human skin wrapped around the handle), and aid Scotland in  winning their freedom.  The point is made, the film is excellent - see it -  many times.
B000000W6F|3.0|Este disco marco el inicio de los smashing pumpkins, sin duda un gran disco, con esa energia que movia al mundo en los inicios de los 90s, un gran disco de lo que alguna ves fue llamado Grunge
0679777547|5.0|The Dumas Club is a throughly enjoyable read.  but be warned, it's full of (explained) literary references, so if you just want the explosions and daemons you felt jipped out of in The Ninth Gate, look elsewhere.<br />also,  this is not the book version of the ninth gate.  Mr. Pereze-reverte, i'm  assuming, read and incredible book that was out of print and saugt to share  it: for all intents and purposed, it's a remake of Jaques Cazotte's 18th  century novella &quot;the devil in love&quot;.  don't believe me? read it.   the story lines of the dumas manuscript and the ninth gate are secondary  stories.  Lucas needed the distractions Alvaro had to keep him from overly  second guessing his companion.<br />It reads much better when you realize it's  about Lucas and Irene, and the writer has the freedom to romaticise and  frankly look at their relationship.  i'm pretty sure no one would have  appreaciated it if Cazotte had permitted Alvaro and Biondetta.  and we may  never of heard the story if he hadn't brought it back.
B000006NPY|5.0|Para mi gusto este es el mejor disco de las calabazas, pro muchas razones: El sonido es impecable, las letras tortuosas, te mantiene en un ambiente de oscuridad muy placentero, con canciones frias, ambiguas, y en momentos  desconcertantes, la banda no suena tan fuerte como en otros discos, pero si  gana mucho en tecnica, ademas, con las calabazas nunca se sabe que puede  ocurrit, ademas comentario aparte viene tal ves la mejor cancion de los SP:  Ava Adore, sin dejar fuera a Tear, Perfect, Dhapnes Descend y muchas  mas...un gran disco de lo mejor de los 90s
B000002UUX|5.0|Firstoff, I would like to say that this is one of the best metal albums ever to be released. This is Megadeth's first album with drummer Nick Menza and guitarist Marty Friedman. This album's main feature, IMO, is the  intricate guitars. Solos are everywhere, especially on &quot;Hangar  18.&quot; Many feel that this is the best song on the album, but I like  &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; better. This album features less thrash than  previous ones, but it is still better. The end of &quot;Five Magics&quot;  is one of my favorite moments on the album. All the songs are great, except  for &quot;Dawn Patrol.&quot; I don't really get the point of this song,  because it only features drums and bass, with overdubbed vocals from Dave  Mustaine. The only other complaint that is worth a mention is the fact that  this album is not very heavy. The drumming isn't as &quot;thunderous&quot;  as it should be.  With all complaining aside, this album is incredible and  should be in any metal head's collection.
0792156684|1.0|I was fascinated by the story of the Titanic when I was growing up and must admit that this version of the story was a total failure in my eyes.  Forget that it made $600 million; that just goes to show how aimless people  are with their money.  I felt the movie ignored too many of the historical  perspectives that caught my attention as a child; the movie only seemed  concerned with attempting to develop the worst love story of all time.  I  can name at least 10 &quot;chick flicks&quot; that are twice as good and  didn't cost a tenth to make.
B000009EAD|5.0|I am a huge Iced Earth fan, and this is probably my favorite album by them. I would give it more stars, if it was possible. The album starts off with &quot;Burning Times&quot;, a heavy, mid-paced, enjoyable toon. Then we  get to &quot;Melancholy (Holy Martyr)&quot;, which is more of ballad, and a  very impressive one at that. &quot;Disciples of the Lie&quot; is pure anger  and adrenaline, and I love it. A few more ballads are present, those being  &quot;Watching Over Me&quot;, &quot;Consequences&quot;, and &quot;Blessed  Are You.&quot; &quot;Blessed...&quot; is the only song on the album that I  don't love. On this album, every style of Iced Earth is well-represented.  The early thrash can be heard on the aforementioned &quot;Disciples of the  Lie&quot;, &quot;Stand Alone&quot;, &quot;My Own Savior&quot;,  &quot;1776&quot; (which is a fine instrumental), and the &quot;Something  Wicked&quot; trilogy, especially on &quot;Birth of the Wicked.&quot; This  trilogy tells the story of the arrival of the anti-Christ with these songs:  &quot;Prophecy&quot;, &quot;Birth of the Wicked&quot;, and the best song on  the album, &quot;The Coming Curse.&quot; You have to hear this song to  fully appreciate it. I would recommend this album to anyone, as it is one  of my favorites. Iced Earth deserves any recognition they receive.
B00003CX5A|5.0|This movie s so neat and funny! scary, whatever, funny!  you must watch  it now. why aren't you going? GO NOW!  special five star moments- head rolling into Ichobod's lab and him fainting  (looking neat as always), him  having blood splattered all over him, hand beckoning to him and him  fainting, basically him fainting and ... just watch it! i release you.
B000002B7M|5.0|In my opinion, this is Ozzy's best album. Randy Rhoads is one of the best metal guitarists to ever live, may he rest in peace. I love all the songs, but especially &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;, and  &quot;Suicide Solution.&quot; My only concern with this album lies with the  production. It was sufficient in 1980, but now it just doesn't cut it. When  listening to 'Diary of a Madman', this problem becomes easily clear.  Randy's guitar sound just doesn't seem to &quot;rip&quot; as much as on the  follw-up. By all means, buy this album. It is one of the best in metal's  history.
0780628551|2.0|This movie is so-so, something that I would only watch when there's nothing else for me to do. The movie is suspensful enough but once the viewers manage to figure out where it's going, it's becoming a bit stale.   I do feel that the movie is built upon from a very simple premises &amp;  therefore, there's only so much that it could go.  The on-your-face scary  moments are deliberate as we have seen in other horror flicks.  I couldn't  help noticing Charlize Theron once again played a victimised wife, as she  had done in the Devil's Advocate.  To be truthful, the atmosphere of the  movie is similar to something that's come out from X Files, even its open  ended ending.  Well, you would spot its uncanny resemblance with X Files  especially when the credit starts to role (its font &amp; background is  exactly the same.  The only absence is X Files theme song).  Well, watch it  if you need to but don't buy it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|It's a great CD.  All the songs are good!  Buy it!
B00000064G|4.0|Pink Moon is the 2nd CD I have bought solely because of a Volkswagen commercial. The 1st was the Spiritualized CD a few years ago. Volkwagen is influencing more of my music decisions than radio, VH1, or MTV.<br />At first  listen, the CD was somewhat disappointing because there was nothing as  immediately revelatory as the luminous title track.  But after about 3  weeks the CD has really grown on me. The soft acoustic melancholy is  perfect listening for a lazy Sunday morning. It's hard to pick faves since  the songs seem to work best as one almost 30 minute suite but if you are  looking for other songs to sway your purchasing decision I would suggest  the crossroads decison of Which Will and or the fantastic instrumental Horn  which you can listen to samples of and the bluesy Know and possibly  optimistic album closer From the Morning which unfortunately you can't  listen to samples of. Who cares why you bought this CD, chances are if you  give it a while that you will like it.
6300214753|4.0|This movie is top-notch. One of my favorites. It's Matthew Broderick at his prime, for those fans out there. The story of a high school kid who can get away with skipping an entire day of school w/o getting caught is good  fun for all. Jennifer Grey does a good job, and there's a Charlie Sheen  cameo, if you're one of his groupies. So go out and get it. I highly  recommend it. It is so choice. What? You're still here? This review is  over. Go. Go on.

B000002BE9|4.0|Right around the time Fiona Apple was garnering just as much airplay as she was accolades for &quot;Tidal,&quot; her debut album, she also showed a knack for raising eyebrows: there was the video in her underwear, not to  mention her denouncement of an MTV award as she accepted one.  But for  whatever maturity she lacked in public presentation was more than made up  for in her music, as this lush and jazzy project proves.<br />The album kicks  off with a bass-heavy drum lick and a husky a capella line: &quot;I tell  you how I feel but you don't care/I say tell me the truth but you don't  dare/you say love is a hell you cannot bear/and I say give me mine back and  then go there, for all I care.&quot;  Clearly this is not the work of a  producer-guided youth; Fiona is world- and love-weary beyond her years,  evident in both her embittered lyrics and her husky alto.   &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; was a loungey, sophisticated piece that nonetheless  found its way to radio, and when a song like &quot;Criminal&quot; seemed  tailor-made for radio, it was a mere coincidence; no artistic integrity  spared here.<br />Other gems include the jazzy, Joni Mitchell-esque &quot;Slow  Like Honey,&quot; and the slinky groove of &quot;The First Taste&quot; (for  the latter, imagine Sade with a dark side).  Throughout the album Fiona  further exerts her originality with arrangement; it's not every day that  you hear acoustic piano and vibraphone in modern pop music.  However, a  trio of ballads in the second half of the album were arranged a little too  similarly to have any one of them particularly stand out; a better result  for listening to &quot;Never is a Promise,&quot; &quot;The Child is  Gone,&quot; or &quot;Pale September,&quot; while all perfectly acceptable  and lovely ballads, would be to listen to them on shuffle in a  multiple-disc changer.<br />But any complaints with &quot;Tidal&quot; are  petty.  With an album this strong, original, and just plain gorgeous, it is  hard to find much fault with Fiona Apple...public antics and all.
630280082X|5.0|Some things in life give you a feeling inside that you just can't describe. Crossroads does that for me.It's an epic roots of blues journey from beginning to end.The mystique of this movie will hold you captive long  after it's over.Now I join countless others that wish they new the truth  about Robert Johnson.
B000002G26|5.0|Only a handful of artists per decade are able to create true pop staples that stand the test of time...Bryan Adams is one of those artists, and &quot;So Far So Good&quot; proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br />Hooks  like the ones found in &quot;Summer of '69,&quot; &quot;Can't Stop This  Thing We Started,&quot; and &quot;Somebody&quot; never grow old; they're  the kind of songs that can easily remind you of where you were when they  were popular and still make a great soundtrack for any party or bar of  present day.  The same can be said for ballads like &quot;Straight From the  Heart,&quot; &quot;Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Everything I Do (I Do it for  You)&quot; (especially since enough time has officially passed since radio  played the latter to death).<br />The disc also contains two fan favorites  that easily could have been singles: &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; Bryan's  classic duet with Tina Turner, and &quot;Kids Wanna Rock,&quot; the  quintessential Adams rocker, tailor-made for driving on a highway with the  top down on a hot summer night.  We're also treated to &quot;Please Forgive  Me,&quot; a new ballad exclusive to this release that holds up well next to  Bryan's tried and true hits.<br />Throughout the collection, Bryan's innate  good taste in production and knack for writing classic pop tunes couldn't  possibly be more evident.  And his raspy, rock-n-roll-ready voice is as  classic as his songs.  In the end, revisiting the songs on &quot;So Far So  Good&quot; is like visiting an old friend and laughing about old times:  it's comfortable, it's familiar, and it's something you'll want to do again  and again.
B00000AFFF|2.0|This CD can't help but be pleasant, but unfortunately, that's all it is. The songs just float out there and are completely uninvolving. What sounds like an intriguing pairing of artists turns into a huge question mark: Why  didn't this turn out better? This album has been wildly overpraised; find  some &quot;real&quot; Elvis instead.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple's debut album, &quot;Tidal,&quot; a dark project packed with moody musical landscapes and poetic lyrics sung in a husky, sultry timbre, was one of the most striking pieces of its time.  Among the midst of  Alanis, Jewel, and countless other knockoffs, Apple rose to the top of the  pile as a singer/songwriter sophisticated beyond her years.  This of course  led to many people awaiting her follow-up, &quot;When the Pawn...,&quot;  with anxious skepticism, expecting her to fall flat on her face  artistically.  Instead Apple trumped her own remarkable first work.<br />The  set opens with the dark gothic of &quot;On the Bound&quot; and &quot;For  Your Love,&quot; songs that not only expose but celebrate a needy and  conflicted psyche.  &quot;Limp&quot; is an aggressive, slightly explicit  kiss-off (&quot;it won't be long till you'll be lyin' limp in your own  hands&quot;) and &quot;Love Ridden&quot; is a stark and gorgeous ballad  backed by a warm string section.<br />Elsewhere a strong Beatles influence  serves Apple well, whether it's the swinging tempo of &quot;Paper  Bag,&quot; the offbeat instrumental flourishes of &quot;A Mistake,&quot; or  the overall feel of the chillingly angry ballad &quot;Get Gone.&quot;  But  the album's strongest moment comes on the first single, &quot;Fast as You  Can,&quot; a frantic, multiple-tempo gem that is easily the most innovative  single to hit radio in a decade.<br />It's also a pleasure to find Fiona's  lyrics on a higher level than last time around; whereas her debut's lyrics  sometimes seemed to be trying to hard to impress, the emotional targets  here are dead-on, even when her verse actually makes you dash for a  dictionary (and don't feel bad if it does...how many people use  &quot;desideratum&quot; in everyday speech?).<br />Throw in fine-tuned  production by Jon Brion, surrounding Apple with a backdrop that is as  exciting and unpredictable as she is, and you have a project that is  anything but a sophomore slump.   Oddball, 90-word title aside, this is a  work of art.
B000002B82|5.0|The key element in rock music is the guitar. When you combine killer guitar playing with vocals that, for once, as this CD does perfectly, COMPLEMENT it, you have perfection. This CD is a must have for anyone who  loves rock, and appreciates the 'Total Package' experience. This is Ozzy's  best, by the way.
B00000DC4A|3.0|Have you ever noticed how some songs can make an artist sound like he's fine-tuning his trademark sound, while others sound he's merely rehashing it?  Behold Bryan Adams' &quot;On a Day Like Today,&quot; a classic example  of an artist both flourishing and spinning his wheels in familiar  territory.  <br />The title track is one of Adams' strongest compositions;  attention paid to boybands and the Latin music phenomenon made this single  an unfortunate radio casualty.  It's also a shame that radio listeners  weren't treated to &quot;Getaway,&quot; a stunning rock-meets-electronica  excursion with an irresistible chorus.  &quot;How Do Ya Feel Tonight&quot;  shows a little restraint but still soars, &quot;Cloud Number Nine&quot; has  a warm and sunny Eagles feel to it, and &quot;When You're Gone&quot; is a  fun, rocking duet with Spice Girl Melanie C (which manages to succeed even  though Sheryl Crow would have been a much better choice for a duet  partner).<br />Elswhere Adams coasts through territory charted on his previous  releases.  &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;If I Had You&quot; are  perfectly acceptable midtempo numbers, but are nowhere near the realm of  compelling.  &quot;Before the Night is Over&quot; is a tepid exercise, and  when the frantic, &quot;Kids Wanna Rock&quot;-tempo of &quot;I Don't Wanna  Live Forever&quot; kicks in, you appreciate &quot;Getaway&quot; all the  more for being a bit of a departure.  This thought is driven home with  &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread,&quot; the ballad that closes the album  with absolutely nothing new to say.<br />So what we have is an album that  falls somewhere in the middle.  Is it worthwhile for a Bryan Adams fan?   Definitely...half an album of strong material still equals a half-hour of  entertainment, and moments like his self-harmonizing on  &quot;Fearless&quot; remind you of why you like him so much in the first  place.  But for the casual fan of his radio hits, &quot;On a Day Like  Today&quot; may tooeasily sound like a musical recycle bin.  Decide how  much you like him and go from there.
B000003TA4|5.0|this is a great album,I couldnt live without it, I  love it. In my opinion its the greatest album of alltime, Nirvana was like the beatles of the seattle scene.In my opinion the only albums anywhere close to this album  from the seattle scene was alice in chains' Dirt, and pearl jams Ten. I  love this album it was before kurt got as depressed as he did he was  actually a pretty happy guy when he realeased this. you can tell, the music  on this CD is TERRIFFIC!there other albums Bleach,insesticide and in utero  are good but this shines above all of them.if your a fan of rock and  roll  this is a must own!
0446525537|5.0|I feel that A Walk to Remember is an extremely compelling novel.  It touched my heart along with many others I'm sure.  This book made me laugh, cry, and think.  It made me appreciate the things that I have and not to  take them for granted.  A Walk to Remember showed me that just one event in  your life can turn it upside down and change it forever.
B000007T1M|5.0|I have been listening to System of a Down for a little under a year now, and i think that they are a great up and coming band. At first off you hear Serj's wacky voice and think that this is a band trying to hard, but if you  continue to listen they really grow on you. i was fortunate to have caught  them at Sno-Core 2000, and I must say that it is probably one of the best  shows I have ever seen anyone put on. Just seeing the band charismatically  jump around the stage crying their urgent message of political opression  got them my immediate respect. But when they mix the lyrics with their  roaring instruments, they really create something special!
B000002KHF|5.0|I can not say enough about &quot;Moondance.&quot; As a whole, this album is his finest, with perhaps the most romantic song &quot;Crazy Love,&quot; and my personal all-time favorite &quot;Into the Mystic.&quot; For those  new to Van, looking to expand beyond the Greatest Hits albums, let this be  the first album you buy. Its a classic and will surely convince you to buy  other Van albums and will puzzle you why Van doesn't have more Greatest  Hits albums, of which surely Into the Mystic and Crazy Love would be  included!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The first time I heard this album it didn't seem that 4 year wait for another rage cd had been just. However I continued to listen and saw the depth in their songs. In the previous two albums rage talked about their  disgust with the government, and extreme call for action. This album on the  other hand describes the people in the situations rage had been talking  about. For example, the song Maria is about a refugee (probably Mexican)  brought north to work in a sweatshop. Through graphic lyrics we are able to  see the message that lead singer Zach De La Rocha is trying put forth. The  lyrics in &quot;Battle&quot; are as powerful (if not more powerful) as they  have ever been. Tom Morrello is at it again with violent guitar riffs that  nobody else has ever dreamed about. This album is great, the band puts  forth a great exibition of talent. Need I say more?                        Free Mumia!
B000002BQK|5.0|I've had this album for 3 years now and I still play it at least twice a week. Yeah, so Mariah is different this time around, but is it really our  place to judge? After 4 studio albums with Tommy Mottolla, wasn't it about  time he gave her permission to record as herslef? That is not to say that  her previous work was superficial, it just wasn't what she always wanted.  Now, she can do what she wants and about time, too! I love all her older  stuff, but lets face it, R&amp;B is where she's from and what she enjoys  most. Ok, best tracks?: <br />'Honey'- This is sexy, smooth and a great party  track.<br />'Butterfly'- A pretty, honest and not- too-intense ballad. <br />'My  All'- Arguably her most heart- wrenching song to date. One of my all time  favourites.<br />'The Roof'- Chilling yet catchy, and incredibly  mellow.<br />'Fourth of July'- This track annoys me sometimes, but it does  posess a light, not-too-heavy quality.<br />'Breakdown'- One of the best  examples of Mariah's ability to compose and perform R&amp;B  music.<br />'Babydoll'- So slinky and has a real sense of loving  someone.<br />'Close My Eyes'- I play this when I'm frustrated about my life,  usually with my eyes closed! A calming track.<br />'Whenever you Call'- A  truly heartwarming ballad, I believe even better with the talents of Brian  McKinght, who sings this with her on the #1s album(if you don't have that,  CHECK IT OUT!).<br />'Fly away'- hmm, I usually skip this track. It doesn't  compare to Butterfly.<br />'The Beautiful Ones'- After playing this track a  hell of a lot, I decided it's probably one of my favourites. Dru Hill's  voices help no end!  <br />'Outside'- not as personal as 'Looking In', from  'Daydream' or 'Petals' from 'Rainbow', but still touching.<br />The Honey  remixes aren't really my thing, and I ADORE R&amp;B. I love this album, and  I ask that anoyone who hasn't yet heard it listen with an open mind and  heart.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Alright, where to start. I'm gonna start with my complaint first. For such a magical event, the set list could've been better. &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; only had two songs. While &quot;The Call Of Ktulu&quot; and  &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; are amazing, where was &quot;Creeping  Death&quot;? What about &quot;Fade To Black&quot;?  &quot;Master Of  Puppets&quot; fared better with three, my favorite being  &quot;Battery&quot;. But why in the hell was there only one song off of  &quot;.....And Justice For All&quot;?  (sob) Maybe it's just me, but  &quot;Harvester Of Sorrow&quot; or &quot;Blackened&quot; would've been  better than &quot;Outlaw Torn&quot;. Also, where was &quot;The  Unforgiven&quot;? even the second one would've been nice. But I gave this  album five stars, you've heard my complaints, but my praises are far  superior to them. I love all the songs here, Metallica new and old, I love  all Metallica new or old. From &quot;The Ecstasy Of Gold&quot; to  &quot;Battery&quot; I'm hooked on these songs like a sex addict is hooked  on hookers (not that I'd know from experience). &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;  is, was, and always be a classic. Thankfully, it's not hampered with too  much, in fact, I like it more here. &quot;One&quot; is even better, listen  to Kirk's guitar solo....sonic perfection. &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; is  awesome live, better here (Obey your master!). The last three songs off of  disc one are beautiful, especially &quot;Hero Of The Day&quot;. &quot;For  Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; does every metal fans favorite crunch and sounds  awesome here too. &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; and &quot;Sad But  True&quot; are amazing as well. My favorite off &quot;S&amp;M&quot; is  &quot;Battery&quot;. Heavier than Rosie O' Donnell, faster than me running  from the cops (that's really fast BTW), this is the highlight of the  already epic. Symphony wise, these guys probably deserve more credit than  Metallica. Why? Well, could you take Metallica's songs and somehow not  screw them up? No. It's impossible. But these guys (and girls) do. Michael  Kamen and co. have my respect and applause. In the end you get (almost) all  their hits, no misses, no bad songs, it's all good. New and old will find  something they love, and maybe a window will be open to the others  material. Less like a CD, more like an experience. Beauty and intelligence  formed through the San Francisco Symphony and Metallica, a classic.
B00003CWL5|5.0|First of all, American Beauty is the best film of 1999. Secondly, Mr. Sam Mendes as its director was so talented in THAT he knew WHAT he wanted the film to come out to be:its directions, its feels and ambience , et al, and  also successfully got the best out of those characters in the film via  sublime performance rendered by the whole bunch of brilliant cast  collectively.<br />The whole story of American Beauty was told from what the  spirit of the dead Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) had seen through the  last year of his life.<br />In a peaceful suburban neighborhoood where his  house was located in, it all began with the depressed feelings for his  middle-life crisis; the day-by-day gradual distance kept to each other by  him and his once-so-lovely-and-shiny wife, Carolyn Burnham ( Annette Bening  ), whose life-long ambition was to be the most successful and respectable  residential realtor who was willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING in life just to  get there; their ungrateful teen daughter who always blamed on her parents  for ruining her life; his own going-nowhere publication job.....<br />Not only  everyone in his house was revolving around his self but also the other two  households nearby: the gay couple and the retired US marine Colonel Frank  Fitts and his family.<br />Every character in this film more or less  successfully manipulated others' perceptions towards him or her and in  return his or her own perception was successfully manipulated, which the  film was intended to show how powerful and dangerous SUBJECTIVE perception  could negatively affect one' s life.<br />For instance, the image of Angela  Hayes as a chic, fly girl who hated to be perceived as an ordinary, boring  one; Carolyn Burnham who always felt the need to project the image of  success ( Personally, as a former realtor, I really felt for her as if I  were in her shoes in the film ) despite the fact that she was so miserable;  Ricky Fitts who' d successfully convinced his pop that he could afford all  of his latest hi-tech audio-visual systems in his room with his  table-waiting job - Memorable quote: Never underestimate the Power of  Denial....; et al.<br />The film also wisely played with psychological defense  mechanisms like displacement, regression, rationalization, etc.<br />Wrapping  it up, the drama-comedy American Beauty realisticly projects and deals with  the elements of middle-life crisis, hidden depression, black-mailing,  subjective perceptions, shattered dreams and finally the flashback of  Lester's best years of his life just in time of his departure.<br />About the  cast: Kevin Spacey, once again, delivered another of his sublime  performance as usual; Annette Bening, in my humble opinion, deserves an  Oscar-winning tie with Miss Swank of Boys Don' t Cry; Something about the  way Wes Bentley looked in this film for 100 % convinced us that he was not  acting as Ricky Fitts, rather he WAS Ricky Fitts- Too bad that '99 nominee  list of Actor in Supporting Role's traffic are so jammed with great actors  with their deserved nomination; Wittiest screenplay with masterful plot  twistS and heavenly cinematography, to name a few.<br />American Beauty is  definitely a film that is and will always be a part of viewers' sweet  memories and entertaining experience. <br />Shin P.
6302732875|5.0|And I am a person who can rarely watch a movie twice.  My friends and I can quote exact lines from the movie at the slightest prompting.  The dialogue is at once intensely heart wrenching and side splittingly  hilarious.  Also, this is probably the only major motion picture ever made  without a single female character, not even an extra.  Imagine that.
B000023X9W|4.0|The reformation of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young seems to have sparked life into the old country dog yet again. Silver and Gold sees Young's return to the countrified barn-dance ethics of superior releases such as  After the Goldrush (1970) and Harvest (1972). Off-centre autumn lullabies  echo through the set list on sublime pieces like Buffalo Springfield Again  and Daddy went walkin', and throughout one feels Young and his creaky  ensemble wallow in the joys of quirky country choruses and basal whines.  Whether the timeless quality and sharp social insight of old will hold true  on this Neil Young release remains to be seen. But certainly this is as  lofty and exquisite a Neil Young as we may ever see again and without doubt  benchmarks a most stately homecoming.
B000002UA5|2.0|I love Pink Floyd, don't get me wrong, but the studio CD is garbage. With the possible exception of two tracks this isn't worth buying.<br />While the studio CD is self-indulgent experimentation without any musical direction,  the live CD is a vast improvement. However, as it only has four tracks this  should only really be purchased if you want to own every Floyd release.  Otherwise these CD's will not be enjoyed.
B000000Y27|5.0|As the very useful liner notes to this release point out, this 1960 recording was a bit of a coming-out party for Montgomery, arguably the best and most influential jazz guitarist of the last half century. The title is  not hyperbole; the guitar playing here is indeed incredible, although Wes  sets aside mere flash for meaningful swing.<br />The guitarist benefits from a  crack band behind him: Al and Percy Heath on drums and bass, respectively,  and the flawless Tommy Flanagan on piano. Flanagan had shortly before this  date contributed mightily to Coltrane's &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; and his  ability to seamlessly slip in behind Montgomery on a date that couldn't be  more different than Coltrane's is testimony to his taste and his  chops.<br />Wes's startling chording will be a revelation to those who haven't  heard him before, but even if you've listened to him a lot you'll still  find his work on, for example, &quot;Four on Six&quot; and &quot;West Coast  Blues&quot; immensely satisfying. On both these cuts, he flows endlessly  between chords and octaves, creating a smooth river of sound.  Beautiful.<br />Also of note is his treatment of &quot;Polka Dots and  Moonbeams,&quot; a chestnut that Wes turns into a lovely romance that  sounds new and fresh. This is a great CD for the jazz guitar lover, who  will realize immediately that it doesn't get much better than this.
0783241569|5.0|This sweet and charming movie really makes you laugh.  The combination of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant is well thought out.  His shy and quiet side blends very nicely with Roberts bold and dashing personality.  She's just  wonderful in this light and romantic comedy.  It's a wonderful addition to  any Julia Roberts movie library.  Nice Choice!
1573227978|4.0|I first purchased and read this book while traveling in Thailand.  I remember thinking it was a good read and I could connect with it due to my circumstances at the time.  However, upon returning home I put it on the  shelves and forgot about it - until the adverts for the movie began  appearing on television.  Then I thought I had better read it again to  refresh my memory.  I still liked the book and have recommended it to  selected people.  However, I believe its appeal will be greatest to those  whose own adventures keep them connected to the book's theme.  Those who  stay home may be happier reading &quot;Little Women.&quot; Alex Garland is  obviously a young writer and this book is certainly not destined to be a  classic.  But his characters are interesting, especially the inscrutable  Daffy Duck.  His story line wavers in places, but I believe he does a  credible job of tying it together.  This is not a perfect book, but it is a  fun one to read, especially while traveling.
6304057709|5.0|This recent movie adaptation of Jane Austin's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is just marvelous.  Emma Thompson's enchanting screenplay is so close to the novel, and that's such a rare treat in a movie version.   Yes, Emma Thompson is a bit old for the part of older sister Elinor but,  she's so endearing, I'm willing to let it go.        The supporting cast is  very powerful, with performances by Kate Winslet, Greg Wise, Imogen Stubbs,  Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant toping off a fabulous ensemble.  Winslet is  especially wonderful as the younger Dashwood sister.  She's completely  sweet, young and innocent.  Her heartbreak at the hands of handsome and  dashing  Willoughby is extremely powerful and emotional.  It's an all  around well acted movie.  Lots of wondeful performances. This is acutally a  very funny movie and so beautifully shot by Director Ang Lee.        Every  aspect of the movie is wonderful.  It's treat for all Austin fans and an  all around wonderful film.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Provocative, intense, violent, insane, all these words describe Fight Club. But there's more to Fight Club than a bunch of fight scenes and violence, there's an inner meaning, which hints towards the fall of the  materialistic western society. The people in Fight Club are nothing less  than the victims. They are victims to society and each other as the story  developes. Brilliantly acted, an incredible plot, you can almost feel the  characters pain. The originality of this movie itself baffles the mind. If  you watch it once and then watch it again you can truly appreciate the  twist ending and the originality of the cinematography. What else is there  to say other than: Watch this movie, it is a MUST SEE.
6305513414|4.0|Those who claim Shatner can't act should be shown &quot;The Enemy Within,&quot; an episode that shows that, yes, Shatner can act.  The premise is simple enough--Kirk is split into two halves, one that is the  &quot;good&quot; side of humanity and the other the &quot;evil&quot; half  of humanity.  Over the course of the hour, Kirk learns he needs both halves  not only to command but to be human.  It's a powerful and moving episode  and it certainly features Shatner at his finest as he brings both half of  Kirk to life.  This is one of the finest explorations of Kirk's character  in the entire original series and this episode proves again and again why  the original series is so loved and has endured for so long.<br />As for  &quot;Mudd's Women,&quot; this was one of the three scripts for the second  pilot that Roddenberry wanted to do.  Thankfully, he went with &quot;Where  No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; and the rest is history.  Not that  &quot;Mudd's Women&quot; is bad, mind you. It's a standard Trek story that  features some nice moments with Kirk.   It also deals with how far humans  will go to find acceptance and love and certainly has some rather  interesting, thought provoking themes.  But, overall, it's not one of the  stronger early entries the series had.
0964385619|5.0|Kiyosaki is a financial chef who cooks up receipe after receipe in the hopes of attaining vast monetary wealth.  The thing to remeber while reading this fine book is that the sum is worth more than the parts.  Some  of his ideas, mainly those pertaining to real estate investment are solid  while his forays into the Dot.Com jungle are less successful.  His  adherance to the principle of multipe streams of income is where his true  talent lies; spread yourself thin, take the risk and reap the reward.<br />The  final section of the book in which Kiyosaki hypothesizes that Marxism is  going to become  revitalized due to the internet is surprisingly  compelling.  Workers of the world, it would seem, ARE able to unite and  throw off their chains, thanks to the unforseen powers of the web.  You  yourself may be a &quot;millenium communist&quot; without even knowing it,  simply by the ways in which you surf the net.
0316548189|5.0|Okay I'm only halfway through the book, but this is the best read I've had for a while.  Absolutely fascinating, well written and insightful.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of South Africa and or the strength of human spirit.  My next book will be one  written by someone who supported aparthied.  I am very interested to see  some arguments in support of the system Nelson fought against.
B000002J1C|5.0|This album was their breakthrough! With the acquisition of Steve Howe, Yes clearly went into musical areas no one before or since could go. Their music on this album was so astoundingly ethereal that you actually seem to  float away with it. The cuts YOurs Is No Disgrace and Starship Trooper show  off this band's incredible versatility and innovation. And no where can you  hear guitar playing like on Steve Howe's &quot;Clap&quot;.<br />My very  favorite Yes album and a must for any progressive rock fan!
031286504X|5.0|There are three milestones in the development of Vampire lore.  Bram Stoker began the whole thing with Dracula, and Stephen King ushered in the modern incarnation with his 'salem's Lot.  This seminal work by Matheson, originally published in 1954, is the middle stage, bringing Vampires out of  thier Victorian beginnings and into a familiar, urban setting.<br /> The  story tells the tale of Robert Neville, the last man on Earth.  Thanks to a  world-wide plague, he is now holed up in his fortified house, at night  holding off the attacks from the zombiefied vampire populous, at day  roaming a deserted city methodically rooting out and dispatching his  sleeping foes.<br /> This is a true revisionist version of the swave, Bela  Lugosi bloodsucker. Neville is a proper British practicioner of logic, and  as he puzzles through what is going on, the entire vampire legend is  sussed-out with proper scientific method.  And as the legend is  deconstructed, we also see the wonderfully drawn Neville travel through a  heartbreaking character arch as he comes to grips with the vast solitude he  can't decide is worth living through or not.<br /> Influential is  a label often given to this story, and it's not hard to see the fallout it  has created with the authors in the horror genre today.  Filling out the  book are several other, shorter tales created by Matheson, some of which  fly higher than others, but are all entertaining to read.  Matheson was a  contributer to Rod Serling's classic anthology series The Twilight Zone,  and reading these stories makes it easy to see why.  They are extremely  well-crafted, accessable and leave a lasting impression on the reader.  I  Am Legend made it to the screen in two versions: one as an entry in the  Charleton Heston 70's SF sweepstakes called The Omega Man, and the other a  much more faithful adaptation made in the early 60's called The Last Man on  Earth, starring the venerable Vincent Price.  Both are worth seeing, but  even the creepier Last Man pales in comparison to the source material.  Read it and the other stories and see how Matheson laid the foundation for  the modern horror/suspense market.even the creepier Last Man pales in comparison to the source material.

B000002C1Z|5.0|Animals is a brilliant album that shows Roger Waters writing at its peak.  It is a concept album that brought up new thoughts and ideas in my head.  Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep (the songs) are amazing.  Everytime I listen to Dogs,  I skip back to 14:08 of the song and listen to Dave Gilmour's guitar solo  and awaiting the great conclusion of lyrics at 15:20.  I may sound a bit  obsessive, but it's great.  Its only flaw is that Roger Waters doesn't give  the other Pink Floyd members their chance to shine.  Dave Gilmour does  &quot;shine&quot; a bit in Dogs, though.  But Waters does most of the work.   It's still good.  If you liked The Wall, get this.  Hey, trust me.  The  songs may be a bit long but thats how I like it.  Pink Floyd jams like in  Wish You Were Here and Meddle.
B000002J1M|5.0|This could be the best recording in the history of, not only Genesis' career, but possibly in all of rock and roll.  Am I stretching a bit?  Well, maybe--but this is simply one of the best.<br />Some reviewers of this  album have written that the other songs on &quot;Foxtrot&quot; besides  &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; are boring and dull.  This is FAR from the  truth.  &quot;Super's Ready&quot; is clearly the stand out track at 23  minutes.  Some might cringe at a song of that length but this epic song  never gets boring.  It changes when you want it to change.  It goes where  you want it to go.  It starts right when you want it to--not taking 4  minutes to get to the first word.  It is simply brilliant.<br />Now, to the  other tracks.  They are all great.  I could go in detail on each but I will  only comment on possibly my favorite song of all time: &quot;Can Utility  and the Coastliners.&quot;  This song does exactly what a song should do.   It takes you to a different place with its lyrics and melodies.  I don't  think I've ever heard a song as powerful and emotional as  &quot;CUATC.&quot;<br />&quot;Foxtrot&quot; was the album that made Genesis a  household name in my world of music.  If you're looking to get started with  Genesis--this is the start.  If you like other Gabriel Genesis albums--this  is one to add.  If the Phil Collins era is more your style--I think this  album will still be accessible for you.  To put it another way--buy this  album.  <br />It may change your life.  <br />Am I stretching a bit?  Well,  maybe--but in a little, subtle way, it changed mine.
0140282033|5.0|I don't think it would be possible to speak about this luscious morsel of a book without breaking into confectionary prose. I found the dual narrative of the agitated and judgmental Reynaud and the tranquil and  accepting Vianne both effective and delicious and the author's ability to  evoke the smells and textures of the chocolate shop mouthwatering. Despite  its fairy tale quality, Chocolat is very much grounded with themes --  confronting personal demons, living in an unaccepting society, the  consequences of unpopular choices -- that affect us all.  I'm pleased that  Ms. Harris's next novel is to include the same supporting cast of  villagers. While many are peripheral to the main plot, the author has  developed their characters so well that I'm glad I'll have the chance to  learn more about them --and satisfy my senses at the same time!
B000002H72|5.0|Now THIS is something eh... The perfection achieved by The Pixies is resumed in this album. Along with Surfer Rosa, this album changed the indie revolution forever.... It has great songs, the best ones from the Pixies like Here Comes Your Man, Debaser, Monkey Gone To Heaven, but they´re all  memorable, frankly...<br />Buy this cd!  It´s as good as it gets...
6300215512|5.0|This biting dark comedy is an example of Hollywood at it's best. Gloria Swanson delivers a powerhouse performance of gothic creepiness as aging silent-screen star Norma Desmond, ironically Swanson was big in silent  films herself. William Holden also delivers a classic performance as Joe  Gillis, a writer-gigolo that parks his car in the wrong house. Eric von  Stroheim, silent film director of such classics as 'Greed', plays Max the  Butler, Norma Desmonds greatest fan. A work of art by Billy Wilder, and  probably his greatest movie. An extremely clever and witty screenplay  creates fascinating characters and fills the movie with inside Hollywood  jokes. One of the All Time Greats. Extras: spot Buster Keaton playing  bridge. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!
B000001OAA|4.0|Not bad AT ALL!  Its got extremely good songs for a group and its first album... Great debut Garbage!  Some radio favs like Vow, Stupid Girl, and why not Only Happy when it rains shock this album and makes it really  good...
B00003CWOL|5.0|Ok. The juxtaposition of the vulgarity, the innate human vulgarity, and the discussions of the divine are what make the movie such a joy, because we are all poor wretches when we're not in the public eye. True faith  extends far beyond the confines of a weekly ceremony in an ornate building.  The place it takes in our every day life is what really matters, and this  is what the film examines. This and the ridiculous 'dogma' that shackles  people into fearing their God rather than loving him. Kevin Smith should be  more sensitive? Give me a break. There is no point? Give me a break. Wake  up. It is infuriating that someone would question a film makers/writers  freedom to explore ideas in any manner he/she desires. I hope the two of  you don't live in America and if you do, don't bother voting. It will just  be a waste of time. Smith is a genius. PLEASE email me. I'm sure I'll be  able to sell you a few indulgences, or maybe a thorn from the crown set  upon Jesus' head. vikings81@hotmail.com
0451160916|5.0|What I like about this book, as with all his other books is the incredible ambiguity that Steven King is able to give to his characters. They come across as multidimensional, real people. Also, I like how he keeps interspersing their thoughts with the descriptions of the environment and  the passing actions. It gives it a soothing dreamlike, feel. The shining is  one of my favorites. It's a terrifying story,and very well written. I liked  the T.V. series better than the movie with Jack Nicholson. But the movie  had a more intense, terrifying feel to it. I watched it when I was ten and  it scared me to death.
0393316041|5.0|This book is not all about physics / science, rather it's about life. I found the book very real and inpirational - just the way Feynman lived his life. No, I don't think many of us would come close to his intellectual  brilliance but it's not just about that - it's about living life with  passion! he's honest being a &quot;real-fake&quot; (as opposed to a  fake-fake&quot;), and it's just an example of his sincerity that reaches  out to us when we read the book. Feynman shows us how to live life to the  fullest passion. Wow.
B000005RFQ|5.0|Ian Gillan with Sabbath, combination between Deep purple and Sabbath styles,...cool!  Disturbing the priest, Trashed is my fave one
B000002UBU|5.0|One day I caught my two teenage daughters listening to Madonna's version of &quot;American Pie&quot;. I told them it was awful. &quot;This is an old song?&quot; they asked.... In fact I was the age they are now when it was  first released.  I've still got the LP album, and after one hearing the  girls were addicted. To ALL the songs.  Now, of course, they want me to buy  them the CD... They just don't write or sing 'em like that any more.
6304493681|1.0|I know that most people will disagree, but I found this movie to be wholly disappointing. While the concept is good, albeit unoriginal, the payoff just is not there.  Comparing this movie to the Matrix is doing the Matrix  a grave injustice.  The technobabble in this anime, while necessary, often  times gets a bit excessive and hokey.  The segments of  &quot;characterization&quot; come off as shallow and unfulfilling.  Perhaps  my reason for disliking this so much is because I expected much more  action, of which there isn't that much(although the opening sequence is  beautiful).  The plot seems fragmented and disjointed at times, coming  together to form what I felt was a completely contrived conclusion.  To put  it bluntly, there are MUCH better movies to blow your money on than this  one.
630575067X|1.0|I was so hoping to love this movie. I plugged my ears and shut my eyes to the critic's reviews -only to find that they were right. None of the  characters grew at all in the picture. Not one of them seemed to care about  anything. They were flat and basically one-note characters. Only the future  Emperor had a glimmer of life to him.  The others had less enthusiasm than  you see in your average fast-food employee.<br />If you like SciFi, buy  &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;. Give this one a pass.
0446607274|4.0|I agree with most of the good and bad aspects of this novel that I have read in other reviews.  I'm a fan, having read every Bosch novel except the first.  This one is not better than Concrete Blonde or The Last Coyote.   The ending was contrived.  Certain skills of the killer are constantly  mentioned in the text, as if to foreshadow what will be a very interesting  confrontation at the end.  These allusions are not realized.  Had they  been, this would have been a 5 star novel.
6304539282|5.0|This trilogy was great. Full of action and adventure, it shows what the human imagination can really create. George Lucas is a genius. The acting may not be the best at times, but it doesn't matter. The action more than  makes up for it. This is a must buy!
B000002A33|5.0|I have to agree with the other reviews here - this really is a masterpiece.  This was the first album I'd heard from the Trees, and I was hooked ever since.  It manages to amaze me each time I listen to it and  discover something new.  I bought this CD in the summer of '96 and I  _still_ play it frequently now.  Probably one of the finest records of the  last decade!
6305073341|5.0|Back in 1987 RoboCop was the sleeper hit of the summer. I had read a little about the film prior to its release, but after I saw the trailer, I knew it was gonna be awesome. I saw the sneak preview a week belore the  film's actual release, I was simply floored. I saw it 4 or 5 times during  it's release. In the sneak preview I saw, the cut footage was still  intact.<br />Peter Weller is terrific as the ill-fated cop who is brought back  to life as the virtually indestructable cyborg. Nancy Allen plays his  partner who helps him rediscover his old identity. Kurtwood Smith is a real  stand-out as the nerdy looking yet appaulingly sadistic cop killer Clarence  Boddicker. Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer are terrific as the corporate suits  that battle over Robocop.  <br />The story is filled with violence and a  biting sense of humor. Writers Ed Neumeier and Michael Minor create both a  super and tragic hero. Both a live action Comic Book film and a  contemporary satire. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven made his American film  debut here and pulled no punches. Rob Bottin's RoboCop suit and makeup work  is first rate and highly unique. Basil Poledouris's highly charged music  score is terrific.<br />There are two DVD releases, a standard widescreen  release and the Criterion Collection. The later one has some very nice  extra features. While both are widescreen, neither are anamorphic editions,  I imagine one will be released sometime in the future. Despite this  overlooked feature. RoboCop is must have for Sci-Fi/Action film fans.   Definately NOT a film for the kids.
B00003CXDU|5.0|Let me tell you, I read the premise for Galaxy Quest months in advance, and I was quite sckeptical. I absolutely loathe Star Trek, and I thought this would be just as awful. But once it came out, I kept reading review  after review that was so positive, that I just had to go and see it.  (Besides, there wasn't much else too choose from at the time.) But I tell  you what, I was so pleasently suprised on how much I walked away liking  this movie. It's sweet natured and good hearted; something you don't get  every day. Also I was privy to the fact that it was a great film I could  take my little sister too, and not have too worry about content.           So all you trekkies out there, I hope you had a great time at this film  that honors you; but more importantly, to all those non-trekkies out there,  you should open your minds and give this film a chance. There is plenty of  subtle comedy in it that I believe takes multiple viewings to get. But I  know you will love it. I know I did, and I am hard to please.
0790729342|5.0|In 1982 this epic action film was released here in America as The Road Warrior.. In Australia and Europe it was Mad Max 2. The film that made Mel Gibson a movie star. A landmark action film that has been emulated  considerably since it's release.<br />The world has finally caved in after  wars and social decay. Australia has become an epic wasteland where it's  remaining survivors hunt down the remaing gasoline. A bizarre and vicious  pack of barbarians led by Lord Humongous kill any and everyone who gets in  their way of the precious fuel.  Max now a loner and roams the land for the  fuel becomes a reluctant ally with a motley but tight knit group that has  established a small fuel depot. An epic battle ensues when the ragtag group  decides to transport its fuel to &quot;The Promised Land&quot;<br />This  explosive and spectacular film still lives up to the critical and public  applauds here in 2000. Mel Gibson's Max is a futuristic take on Clint  Eastwood's Man with no name. Bruce Spence as the Gyrocaptain, Mike Preston  as Papagallow, Virginia Hey as The Warrior Woman and Emil Minty as the  memorable feral kid are some of the standouts in the film. Brian May's  exciting music score adds to the tension and action of the film.  George  Miller created an epic masterpiece and all but the greatest  &quot;sequel&quot; ever made. This DVD edition is a must have for action  film fans
B00003CWRX|4.0|This is a true story about an ex-Tobacco executive who is cohersed into revealing secrets from his job. The Tobacco company where he used to work has made his life, as well as his family's a living hell.  He fights  back.<br />This is a very gripping movie.  The acting is done exceptionally  well by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, as well as Christopher Plummer. The  plot is very well adapted, making it very easy to watch.<br />Good movie, very  good acting. A must see.
6305075379|4.0|Mad Max was Mel Gibson's breakthough film back in 1979. This low budget film really packs a whallop and set new standards in filming breathtaking car chases. It's essentially a pulp comic book brought to life. A raw and exciting film that set the stage for two powerful sequels.<br />The police,  sporting black leather uniforms and driving colorful high speed cruisers  that are stationed at the Halls of Justice and are constantly under siege.  The bad guys are a malicious motorcycle gang led by a crazed and  psychopathic goon named Toecutter.  After one of Toecutter's cronies is  killed by Max, Toecutter is looking for some serious payback, but he's  messing with the wrong cop...you don't wanna get Max mad.<br />The production  design coveys a world that's gone to hell and captures the grim atmosphere  perfectly. Brian May's (not the guitarist from Queen) exciting music score  gives the film a larger than life quality. Director George Miller makes the  most of his small budget. The chase sequences and editing is terrific.  <br />This DVD edition is taken from the original video release.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Before the Academy Awards program this Spring, I had only seen the movie \\"American Beauty\\". I vowed after the awards to see some of the other movies included in various categories.The first movie I picked up for my new DVD player was the film, \\"The Insider\\". Russell Crowe, with whom I first became acquainted in \\"L.A. Confidential\\", is positively Deniro like in his depiction of the major protagonist. Crowe's performance was much meatier than the Best actor performance of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. The film itself was also far superior to \\"American Beauty\\". Michael Mann delivers here as he did in the movie \\"Manhunter\\" where we first meet the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector. Why this crew didn't receive its \\"props\\" from the established motion picture industry I'll never understand (tongue in cheek). Of course we know that the answer really is that \\"Hollywood\\" like the tabacco industry is quite happy to avoid controversy when it serves big business'interests. \\"The Insider is a great motion picture; and the actors' performances are riviting. <br />big business interests. The Insider is a great motion picture with riveting performances by all of the actors.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This album is by far one of the best albums i've ever heard. To start with, the best songs on the album are tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12. The best of those has to be Anthem (12) - it's a tune you can listen to  over and over again. The worst song on the album is Mutt (10), but that is  still a good song, just not to my liking. All The Small Things is a song  that will never grow old, every time it comes on the radio, i pump up the  volume. Take my advice, if you don't own it, go to your nearest music shop  and buy it, it's only a few dollars, so be a sport and pick it up - it'll  be yer best buy in years!
B00000I8BX|4.0|an awesome cd. great metal and all. but as far as heavy goes....Cannibal Corpse blasts them away. Cars is the best track for me. Like the whole techno beat to it..........and thats good enough
052594527X|5.0|Although this book starts slowly( the first 15 pages) it quickly becomes enthrawling. After I read it I went out and found a book of Vermeer's  paintings. It was wonderful to see the painting and recognize things from  the book. The dialoge is wonderful and the book is beautifully written. I  strongly suggest you read it.
B000002MU3|4.0|When I first wanted to hear R.E.M, I bought their most popular album, &quot;Out of Time&quot;.  I love Pearl Jam and Green Day, so that's what I wanted to hear.  After &quot;Out of Time&quot;, I decided I was never again  going to buy another R.E.M album because they didn't rock; they were too  soft for me.<br />Then, my cousin gave me this album.  I hope there are more  R.E.M albums like this, because I might consider getting into them again.   &quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; is the best R.E.M song ever.  In  fact, all the songs on the first half of this album are good, except for  &quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream&quot;.  The second half is OK.<br />This is the  R.E.M I was looking for.  If you like that soft stuff, then go on and  praise &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;.   However, I love this album because it rocks.  Please tell me if any other  R.E.M albums do.
B00004IA0D|5.0|This double CD is a must for any Blink fan, or any punk rock fan period.  This first CD is the increadable studio album &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, with such truly remarkable songs as &quot;What's my Age  Again&quot; and &quot;Adams Song.&quot;  Also, the CD offers more humorous  tracts like &quot;Aliens Exsist&quot; and just down right awsome punk songs  like &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, &quot;Mutt&quot; and  &quot;Dumpweed&quot;.<br />This Albums second CD is a live one, and Blink sure  does an increadable job preforming.  Check out Damnit on the live tract, it  is really cool.
0312853238|5.0|I cannot stress this enough:  This book is for anyone and everyone.  I cannot stress that enough.  Don't let the fact that it is science fiction (and high-concept sci-fi at that) disuade you.  Don't let the fact that it looks pretty thick fool you.  And don't let the fact that it is about kids  make you pass it by.  This book, since I first read it four years ago, has  become my favorite book of all time.  It is brilliantly written, superbly  concieved, and possesses an ending that is one of the greatest surprises  presented in any medium.  This book is the work of a genius.  A friend of  mine summarized it in this way:  Lord of the Flies in a controlled  environment.  Though that is not entirely accurate (there's a great deal  more to the story), that's a start.  Check it out (PLEASE!) and enjoy!  You  won't be sorry.
B00003CWPR|4.0|Several things about this film sticks out.  First,  I enjoyed it more than I expected.  Second, throughout the whole film I constantly thought will happen next?&quot; which is the sign of an interesting film for me.<br />I  enjoyed the eerie nature, the overall dark tones.  Kubrick uses what I call  &quot;space&quot; or &quot;silence&quot; in this film which adds to the  uneasiness of the viewer.   Example: Tom Cruise's scenes with  corpses.<br />There are also a few things I did not like such as, Nicole  Kidman's performance, the obviously English actors sliding in and out of  American accents. Sidney Pollack, who is usually a nice light addition to  any film he's in, doesn't hold up well here.  There's nothing light about  this film nor his character, he seemed misplaced. The hype surrounding the  orgy scene was unwarranted.  Even with the digitally altered states, I  didn't see anything overly provacative about it.  Much ado about  nothing.<br />The film left a few questions.  First, why did it take 18 months  to make this film?  What happened to the Jennifer Jason Leigh role and if  it weren't cut out, how many more hours would the film have been?   <br />My  best friend and I watched the film together and her response was &quot;I  felt like there was more to the movie that was never explained.&quot;   That's exactly what kept my attention...when would Kubrick explain the  questions?  He never does.<br />Films which do not wrap everything up in a  nice little bow are always more interesting.  For those who'd rather have a  pretty ending , rent &quot;Notting Hill.&quot;
6304698623|5.0|This is a wonderful children's movie. As an adult I also found it very entertaining. It's very fairy tail like. I highly recommend this movie. It's great, and definitely underrated.
6300215954|5.0|A very nice comedy!  John Wayne made one of very   best his movie.Red Buttons is memorabile.   Great music too, everythink it is    wonderful.
B00000251N|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful recordings by Neil Diamond that I have ever heard.
B00004RFDW|3.0|The Insider is entertaining and boasts a great Pacino performance but suffers from overlenghth and a bias. The story is very interesting, but I find it hard to believe some of the actions credited to the allegedly evil  tobacco companies. Another lowpoint is the soundtrack (irritating and  distracting), and the portrayal of Wigand's wife. I am sick of how poor  movies portray women.  Still, the movie was somewhat suspenseful and  interesting and had good performances.
0064407667|4.0|If you like the part of Harry Potter when he's living under the stairs of the Dursley household, before the happy bit where he gets accepted to Wizard school, then you'll enjoy these books.<br />The Baudelaire orphans are nice and smart.  But boy are they unlucky.  The book opens with the  Baudelaire parents dying in a fire and the orphans having to find a  relative to look after them.  Although there is a huge family fortune, they  can't get it until Violet, the oldest at 14, turns 18.  But this doesn't  stop the dastardly (and there isn't really any other word to describe him)  Count Olaf, a horrible and distant relative, and his nasty  henchmen/women/things from trying to get their hands (or hooks) on it.  And  as far as Olaf is concerened, the Baudelaires are expendable, a word which  here means &quot;not needed after Count Olaf gets his hands on the  money&quot;.<br />Just one word of warning--when the author says if you like  cheerful books or happy endings, stop reading now, he means it.  But if you  like miserable scary books with unhappy endings, keep reading!  And you'll  learn lots of horrible words with depressing or unfortunate meanings as  well.
0385484518|1.0|I was so hyped over the reviews I read and the show on Oprah last November that I ordered 2 copies of the book right away.  One for my husband and myself and one for a friend for christmas. My friend was gracious about it I guess because it was a gift but they read on and kept waiting for  something to happen.....I on the other hand have never been able to finish  the book....it didn't hold my attention at all.  I can't believe that some  people actually referred to it as 'the best book you'll ever read'...NO  WAY!    I was and am still terribly disappointed in the book. What a  waste of my time and money.  I would be ashamed to recommend this  book!  There isn't a 'NO STAR' rating , so I feel unduly pressured to  offer a greatly undeserved 'ONE STAR' rating.
0395759242|5.0|Adam Hochschild's book is subtitled &quot;A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa,&quot; and all three can be found in his gripping narrative.<br />The greed is largely that of Leopold II, King of the Belgians.  For years before becoming king, Leopold had been obsessed with  colonies and the wealth that could be extracted from them.  When he came to  the throne, he proceeded to grab a large chunk of the enormous basis  drained by the Congo River, much of which was explored for him by the  mercenary journalist Henry Morton Stanley (who does not emerge favorably  from Hochschild's account).  In his Congo Free State, run by a private  corporation, Leopold wielded far more authority than he did as Belgium's  constitutional monarch, and he used that authority to enrich himself for 23  years.<br />The terror was visited on the inhabitants of the Congo.  Forced  labor was used on a massive scale to extract and export the natural wealth  of the region--ivory and rubber being two of the biggest prizes--and the  chicotte, a nasty whip made of hippopotamus hide, was freely used to lash  every last drop of effort out of people who were essentially slaves.   Hochschild carefully documents the extent of the human costs paid for  Leopold's enrichment.  The death toll due to murder, starvation, disease,  etc., amounted to about half the Congo's population over a 40 year  period--some 10 million deaths to lay at Leopold's door.<br />The heroism was  displayed by people who fought to expose Leopold's crimes and puncture his  undeserved reputation as a humanitarian, and who eventually forced him to  at least give up his personal rule of the Congo.  What was one of the first  great worldwide human rights campaigns involved both the famous, like Mark  Twain and Arthur Conan Doyle, and the little-remembered.  Three men in  particular stand out: George Washington Williams, a black American  journalist who was the first to expose Leopold's reign of terror by  chicotte; Roger Casement, an Irishman who became the first British consul  to the Congo, and as such bore powerful, offical witness to the crimes; and  Edmund Morel, an English shipping agent who founded the Congo Reform  Association, which stands as a forebear to humanitarian groups like Human  Rights Watch in our own time.<br />Hochschild is a meticulous researcher and a  gifted writer, and he brings his century old characters, both the virtuous  and the malignant, to vivid life.  Like many books, &quot;King Leopold's  Ghost&quot; is not pleasant reading, but necessary reading.  Only by  confronting and understanding history's darker episodes can we hope to  avoid repeating them.
6302517036|5.0|I first saw this when i was 15 but couldnt really remember much about ituntil i picked it up on video and wonderd how i lived without it.It is my greatest film of all time.My favourite character is evil ed with Chris  Sarandon a close second.My favourite scene has to be the famous nightclub  scene in particular the bit where Charlie tries to hit Jerry who catches  his fist.But the magic is in the soundtrack where once again Brad Fiedel  proves how good he really is,the songs by Autograph,Sparks, Ian Hunter and  White Sister all being rip roaring slabs of classic 80s rock,and as i did a  couple of days back i urge anyone who remotly liked the soundtrack or 80s  music to grab a copy of the score as it is an absolute master peice.
6302638771|5.0|After years of extensive research and a college course examining the subject, I am almost convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and that most of the conclusions made by Stone are wrong, especially his vindication  of Jim Garrison's flawed and corrupt investigation.<br />That being said, I  truly do think this movie is something special. Firstly, it is extremely  well directed and produced, the music is great and most of the acting is  top-notch. More importantly, this movie affected the American mindset like  almost no other. Almost immediately after its release, Congress passed the  JFK Act and began looking into the classified files. When Stone wrote his  screenplay, many files and studies which provided valuable information were  still sealed and the movie's conclusions were affected by that.<br />However,  I recommend this movie to all because it truly does challenge people to  question everything and to never be lulled into accepting the official  party or government line. That Oswald most likely shot JFK does not mean  that questions should not be asked. All the evidence must be evaluated as  well as the true reasons for covering it up.<br />Though I believe that Stone  has grossly misrepresented certain facts, it is not the job of the movies  to educate Americans about history. What this movie does is spur an  enthusiasm in its audience to learn more about a particular event and how  it affected us all. Such an appeal for thought and action is rare in this  age of mindless sex and violence in Hollywood.
B000001ES4|5.0|I listened to this cd while traveling from Virginia to Colorado last spring,by car. While going through Kansas,with the wheat fields blowing in the wind,clear blue skies dotted with white clouds, I passed a sign telling  me I was following along the old Oregon and California trails.My mind began  to wander and I began to visualize what their travels must have been like  and comparing that with the way I was now traveling.This cd began playing  and between the music,the scenery and the history,I was nearly overcome.  This has to be my favorite road trip cd, I never travel without it.Pop this  in the cd player,roll down the windows and roll on in bliss!  I have all  their cd's and my stress levels after a hectic day at work just melts away  when I listen to them.
B00003CWL6|5.0|1999 was clearly a good year for movies - 'The Matrix', 'Sixth Sense' and of course, 'American Beauty'. <br />The plot centres around two families on a typical American street and how, 'behind closed doors', they are really in  crisis and at odds with each other and themselves. The film is about how  they deal with this, with varying and often sharply satirical results.  <br />But it isn't the plot that makes this film - it is simply the way it is  made and the incredible acting. Kevin Spacey obviously shines, but Annette  Benning and the rest of the cast easily keep up - all strong, excellent  performances. <br />It is simply a well-made, sometimes challenging, often  comical, always inspired adult tale of modern anxieties.<br />One  of the best  movies of the last decade and a standing testament that no amount of  special effects and fancy CGI (of course, apart from the brilliant  'Matrix'), can come close to an intelligently realised film about  'ordinary' people.<br />Whatever else you watch this year, make sure you watch  'American Beauty' - it is one of those rare movies worthy of its hype.  Watch it!
0553274503|5.0|This is a poignant and wonderful novella about a man's metamorphisis from retarted worker to genius and his slow and painful transformation back to his original state.  It is a powerful work because it somehow makes us  question how we view people with intellectual disabilities, and ask is  Charly, the main character, any &quot;better off&quot; with his new found  intellect?  It is sad, it is warm and funny, and it beautifully written and  conceived.  It is well worth a read.

6305426651|5.0|When I first heard of this film, I couldn't believe that someone would make a film about the holocaust and make it funny as well. Guido should be Father of the Year(if not century) hands down. It takes a lot in ingenuity to pull off to your five year old son that there was a game in session and you earned points for staying out of sight and in the end, you get a tank. And, you know, the little fella kind of won that tank in the end. But at what a cost. I won't give away the whole thing here. I also fell in love listening to \\"The Tales of Hoffman\\". My only beef was when they were celebrating Dora's so called engagement party, and they had that Ethiopian bird.(Cause Italy conquered Ethiopia back at that time)I felt although it was in poor taste, it reflected the times. Other than that, it was a great movie and I highly recommend it. Another thing, Guido carrying his son back to their quarters after helping with that party was a haunting scene.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and definitely better than Disney. I'm buying it as soon as I have a DVD player and it comes out. It has beautiful animation, a great story dealing with  traditional, universal themes, and good English dubbing. The only thing  that would make it better is if the DVD is released with the original  Japanese as well.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I have all of Diana's C.D.'s and this one is my favorite.  The title song is wonderfully haunting and I love the rhythem to 'Let's Face The Music and Dance'.  I have many renditions of 'I've Got You Under My Skin' from  various artists, but Diana's is my favorite.  If you're not sure which of  Diana's C.D.'s to start with...I suggest this one.  You'll love it!
6305750750|1.0|I want the dvd, this is suck
0375703764|5.0|there is a difference between a cult novel and great literature. A great cult novel is JG Ballard's Crash, a great piece of Literature is James Joyce's Ulysses. Where is this book? definately on the cult side, but leaning towrds the literature side. The most elusive piece of beauty about  this book is the layout, like a severe bout with a pyschotropic drug, it  pulls you in, where there is suspense, there are few words and lots of  withe space, causing you to read and turn the pages faster. And unlike any  stephen king book, it scared me. made even Lovecraft seem like the muppets.  Best book I've read in a long time.
B000002UB3|5.0|Ladies and Gentleman: I will debate with anyone who attempts to disprove The BEATLES as being less than the greatest rock band of all time.  Abbey Road only provides more evidence to my claim.  With the &quot;end of the  road&quot; already insight, The BEATLES dug deep and produced one of the  best gems ever.  From John Lennon's political statement Come Together to  Paul McCartney's ballad at the end of the album gives airtight evidence of  The BEATLES brilliance.
B000002O1P|5.0|This is a very interesting album by one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever.  This is the sixth album by the band; the first five were all fantastic rock &amp; acoustic albums, but evidently Petty and the boys  wanted to stretch out with some new sounds on this one.  Southern Accents  was originally supposed to be a tribute to the band's roots in the  Southeastern US, but wound up being a melange of psychedelia, horns,  violins, etc - much like the Beatles of 1967/68.  This is a very creative  and enjoyable album, even though the individual tracks can be dissimilar in  style - leaving it a bit less of a &quot;piece&quot; than some other  albums.  A lot of the songs do borrow a bit here and there from other  bands, yet are unmistakeably their own.  &quot;Dogs on the Run&quot; sounds  a good bit like Springsteen, the horn laden &quot;Mary's New Car&quot; and  &quot;Best of Everything&quot; might be at home on a Chicago (the band)  album, the piano and violin driven title song &quot;Southern Accents&quot;  (partly a tribute to Petty's mother, who had died a few years prior to its  writing) is a bit like the Beatles &quot;Let it Be&quot;, while &quot;Don't  Come Around Here No More&quot; and &quot;It Ain't Nothing to Me&quot; are  psychedelic, with very interesting sounds, rhythms and textures. <br />The  opening song &quot;Rebels&quot; may be the best on the album - one of the  best the band has ever done - and it sets the tone for the whole album.   &quot;Rebels&quot; is anthemic, combines the intended Southern theme with  Petty's own feisty &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; mentality, is  appropriately laced with trumpets, yet remains a strong rocker as well.<br />I  have to disagree with the reviewer from Texas who feels Petty and the band  had a &quot;weak period&quot; after Hard Promises and before Full Moon  Fever.  Actually the 3 albums of that period - Long After Dark, Southern  Accents, Let Me Up - are among the very best work the band has ever done,  or thatany band has ever done for that matter.  When you buy this album  realize that it doesn't sound much like any other Petty/Heartbreakers  album.  But like virtually all other Petty &amp; Heartbreakers albums, it  sounds terrific, and has the very interesting and thoughtful lyrics one can  always expect from Petty.
0140177396|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  It was almost as though I could relate to the events of the story even though I had never experienced anything like it in my life.  John Steinbeck did an excellent  job in grasping the elements that went along with this time as well as  telling the story.  Once I arrived at the middle of the book I just could  not put it down. Yet at one point I really wanted to due to content but  still I couldn't.  This book is definitely in the top five best books I  have ever read.  In my opinion the way Lennie was described and acted in  the book was how someone like him actually would in real life.  This book  was compelling and showed how in some relationships you have to do things  for the better even though you know in a way it is not the best thing.  It  is a great book for young adults because although it is fairly deep and  deals with some hard times you really learn something about life and when  you are done it really gets you thinking.  This was an awesome book and  when I look at what it has achieved it is no surprise to me why!  I really  like how Steinbeck focused on one portion of these men's lives instead of  their whole lives.  In a way the book almost skips to the &quot;good  part&quot;.  I enjoy reading when it is interesting and in a way to the  point which was what this book was and my own personal preference.  This  book also shows how much times have changed since when it was written and  it shows younger people of what used to be and mabye even what some of  their grandparents might have lived through.  This was an overall  spetacular book with excellent clarity.  I would reccommend it to anyone  especially young adults.  It provides insight most people would otherwise  not have!
0385334206|5.0|indeed this is the best anything ever (hence best book ever, man). i choose my close friends with this book. i give it to chums and if they like it, they are in, and if they don't, they are decidedly robots full of bad chemicals. <br />vonnegut tells you to listen: we are all robots. face it. you  are a robot! you may say (and i can hear you now) that vonnegut is cynical  for suggesting such a thing. but he is just being honest about our  preposterous existence, and if you think that facing up to the truth is  cynical, then it is you who is looking at reality in a bad light.  <br />vonnegut is probably laughing and laughing about something silly right  now. he is a beautiful robot. i wish he was my friend.  i don't know if  i've mentionned it already, but this is the best anything ever (even better  than the anteater's snout). i kid ye not. word.
B000002OOY|5.0|This has got to be one of the best soundtracks of the century.  With songs that are heartlifting(Journey to the Island), soothing(A Tree for My Bed), and spine tingling(The Raptor Attack) this CD is my absolute favorite.  It  has songs that are just orchestra and some all brass.  Theme from Jurassic  Park was so good, I got my orchestra teacher to teach the class the song so  we can play it. When I bought the Titanic CD I thought it was pretty good.   When I later bought the Jurassic Park CD, I no longer listened to Titanic.   Jurassic Park is in my CD player all the time.  I even bought the sheet  music from Amazon.com and play the songs all the time.  My friends enjoy  the songs too.   Although Williams is more well known for Jaws,(at least  where I live) this is one CD that should be just as popular.  Believe me,  there is ne better CD.
B00003CWQ2|4.0|It is needless to say that this movie is great. I'd like to thank people who made this good movie. Moveing on to the storyline,there are some contradictions ,but you can ignore.<br />You must laugh when you finished  seeing this movie. It doesn't mean that the movie is funny,but it tricks  you very well. I bet you'll enjoy this movie.

6301390725|5.0|This is a really good movie one that your whole  family will love. Its one of my favorite movies. I remember staying up late just so I could watch it on Disney. My favorite scene is when the eels are dancing and Angela  Landsbury and her partner  are swimming with the 4 fish piece band playing.
0684857219|5.0|Anyone who has been training for at least five years knows there is no better book out there. No one should have given this book anything less than a perfect 5! While trends come and go this book is a classic. If you want to master the sport of bodybuilding buy this book. I have read though  the original book cover to cover 3 times and I can tell you you'll always  find new and insightful information. If you're at all serious about  bodybuilding skip out on those useless pills for a week and pick up this  book it will bring you to a new level of knowledge. The guy who was  complaining about over training is way off base bodybuilders today are just  getting lazy and looking for any excuse to stay out of the gym. But if you  want to get cut up and not look like a slob with your shirt off stay close  to the recommended suggestions. The only thing I regret is not ordering the  book in hardcover.
B00001ZWTS|1.0|First,I'd like to say that this movie is terrible. I saw this movie in the theater with my friend. And when we finished seeing the movie, we were discouraged. I could't say anything. I think I don't want increase victims  like me.Seeing this movie is waste of time,and makes you angry I guess.
0316236535|5.0|I am a kindergarten teacher who regularly reads this book to my students.  They love to trace the cut outs and make their own &quot;big green monsters&quot;.  As a grandmother of a three year old, I have enjoyed  introducing her to the fun of this book.  It is one of her favorites.  I am  now going to buy the book for my youngest grandaughter who is just turning  two.
6305090564|3.0|I am a massive fan of monster/creature movies, therefore, I really looked forward to seeing this movie.  However, when the end credits finally scrolled, I can only describe myself as being dissapointed.  Sure the  effects were okay (but did still seem a bit computer generated) and the  movie does offer its fair share of gore; I even liked the idea behind the  story 'prehistoric sea creature attacks ocean liner'.  But I really didn't  like the script, it was just too corny, the acting is unconvincing and the  movie didn't build enough suspense.  It would have been much better had the  film concentrated more on the creature attacking the ship rather than the  annoying rag tag bunch of crims that make up the film's cast. Still the  movie is fairly enjoyable for a one off viewing but I definately reccommend  renting before you buy.
B000002LIM|5.0|Danny Elfman has created a masterpiece with the &quot;Batman&quot; score. If you've seen the movie and like it, you'll fall in love with the music right off the &quot;bat&quot;. . . &quot;The Batman Theme&quot; is classic  and the rest of the album takes from its dark noir-ish atmosphere and  builds on it, crescending in several tracks, such as the Choral bombast of  &quot;The Bat Cave&quot; and the all-out adrenaline pumping, blazing horn  work of &quot;Attack of the Batwing&quot;, my personal favorite track on  the CD. But by no way are these the only good tracks. The playfulness of  Elfman exhibited in &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;, &quot;Edward  Scissorhands&quot;, and &quot;Pee-Wee's Big Adventure&quot; is heard every  once in a while to great effectiveness when related to the Joker, and you  can almost see his gruesome laugh and hear his chuckle when the music  suddenly bursts into a circus march. Listened to as a whole the album is  very well laid out and can be listened through with no problem. One of the  greats!
1558908358|5.0|I havent seen the DVD version so Im not sure what problems people have had, but I can review the movie, (and what an excellent movie it is! ) <br />Being a kid when video games were relatively new, Tron fulfilled all my  dreams of being in an actual computer game!   Imagine VR without the head  gear, cool or what!  Though the graphics arent up to todays standards, its  still a visually stunning movie thats always entertaining. <br />What can I  say about the cast, Jeff Bridges, Michelle Pieffer and Bruce Boxleitner,  are well suited for their respective roles, enhancing the movie with acting  talents.  <br />Though this movie is old, kids these days might not enjoy it  as I do, but then again this is a classic! If you like the idea of being  transported into another world, and fighting your way back out with the  help of some damn smart computer gen individuals then Tron is for you. Get  a hold of a copy and enjoy.
B000005E3K|5.0|If anyone has ever seen the movie &quot;Amadeus,&quot; they have heard selections like &quot;Rex Tremendae&quot; and &quot;Confutatis&quot; from this wonderful masterpiece that Mozart wrote before his death in early  December, 1971.  In fact, he actually never finished it, and some of his  students and friends did just that.  It was the movie that really got me  interested in Mozart at an early age, and I eventually purchased this CD.   <br />This CD is quite good.  It projects a good size sound considering there  are only 32 members in the choir.  There are also some male altos, which  provides power and also that unmistakeable tone.  Sound quality seems to be  very good, and the conductors taste is nice, although I'm not sure if it's  what was preferred by Mozart since I haven't heard many other recordings of  Mozart's Requiem.  Also, the text is sung not in your usual styles of  latin, like italianate latin, but instead keeping with Mozart's background  and sung in Austrian latin.  The soloists do a fine job, although alto  Nathalie Stutzmann is quite dark for my tastes, but that's just me.   <br />Overall, this CD may not be the best to offer out there, but I enjoy it  nonetheless and am glad to have it in my collection.
6303614493|4.0|I like this movie very much. It is so &quot;nice&quot;. Soft and save. And one of my favorite actresses is there. Christina Ricci! This movie wouldn't be so good without the fabulous Ghost Trio! They make me laugh!<br />In here  Finland children under 10 aren't alloved to watch this. Why? This isn't  scary! But this is good, I tell you. Great!
0783230702|5.0|Although sci-fi can't hold 12 monkeys in only this dimension (also romance, action, comedy), 12 Monkeys epitomizes a brilliant picture of this genre. Unfortunately, movies like this get typecast and as usual (sci-fi)  never tends to win awards. Regardless, 12 Monkeys is an achievement with a  great plot, terrific acting, and briliant directing. You cannot get a  better ensemble than Willis, Gilliam, Pitt, and a story that is both  complex and captivating. I have seen many many movies, as I work in a video  store, but this is in my top 5. DEFINITELY 5 stars.
B00000K19E|3.0|Good movie, wonderful technically, defined the state of the art in special effects. As science fiction, though, it's preposterous garbage. The premise is banal in the extreme: people lying in pods in a perpetual dream state  provide energy to run the computer overlords' machines, while the good guys  lurk in a futuristic-but-funky submarine in giant underground sewers. This  is the sort of crap that gives sci-fi a bad name. Why in the world didn't  they hire someone like Bruce Sterling, or William Gibson, or Greg Bear to  provide some intelligent background?<br />Ah well, enjoy it for what it is, I  guess; it shore is purty!
6304411448|4.0|This movie is fun ! fun ! fun ! Johnny Depp steals the show as a nonreader who has  mastered the art of quirky entertaining. I've only seen it once, but in reading the reviews, I think I'll just have to see it again really  soon. I really wish there were more movies out there that are as sweetly  nutty!
B000002C4J|5.0|Celine Dion is so great singer! I love this album. Best songs are &quot;Tell Him&quot; and probably &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. My sister's favorite is &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot;. If you don't buy  this then even borrow this from a friend. Because this is SO GOOD!
B000021Y77|5.0|I loved the film. There is not much more that I can add to what has been already said of the content of the film by many of my co-reviewers. I had to say that the audio commentary by the film's writer/director: Tom Tykwer  and star: Franka Potente was quite informative and entertaining and the  best audio commentary I have yet heard from people whose native tongue is  not English (it's more lucid than many of the commentaries I have heard  from native speakers of English). This will make a fine addition to your DVD library.
0812931017|5.0|The book was, to my delight, a very interesting read. &quot;Losing My Virginty&quot; reads like a novel and I would say that it was as interesting as both &quot;Memoirs or a Geisha&quot; and the &quot;Harry  Potter&quot; series. Yet the book was full of lessons in a variety of  business fields; entrepreneurship and risk-taking being at the forefront of  those fields. In its value as a business book, I would compare it to  &quot;Lessons from the Top&quot; and &quot;The Millionnaire Next  Door&quot;, both of which were a much less gripping read. However,  &quot;Losing my Virginity&quot; is different from those two books in that  it is primarily about &quot;World Class Entrepreneurship&quot;.<br />Branson  takes the reader on a trip back to the 60's and 70's when Virgin took off  and gradually leads you into the &quot;jetstream&quot; of his turbulant  life. You will enjoy the ride.<br />This is definitely a book that I  thoroughly enjoyed and earnestly recommend to anyone, not necessarily to  businessmen, just to anyone who wants to make the most of his/her  life.<br />Richard Branson used the book well on many occasions to tell his  side of the story and to clarify to the public certain events that may have  not been fully disclosed in that way during the time of their  occurance.<br />He also talks freely about matters, which a conventionial  bussinessman would find out of place, beyong the point or even downright  embarrassing. Those &quot;personal&quot; moments are actually the essence  of what this book is all about. The book is about Branson's life and Virgin  Group is just that, a very large chunk of Branson's life.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I have not been on the Smashing Pumpkins bandwagon for long.  I missed the albums when they first hit; hell, the first song I heard by them was &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; from Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.   Needless to say, I had some catching up to do.  Thankfully, that catching  up included listening to this album, which I now consider a  seminal/pivotal/simply amazing point in rock history.  Billy Corgan does  away with pretension by twisting it into glorious rock anthems and  beautiful alt-pop.  The kicker is that, while people wrote them off as  depressionists, almost every moment on this CD can be compared with  euphoric joy.  Even in moments of rage, the beauty of the music shines  through.  Straight-out rockers such as &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot; and  &quot;Quiet&quot; are singular yet grand in their guitar riffs, creating a  near-primal feeling.  Softer numbers such as &quot;Spaceboy&quot;,  &quot;Disarm&quot;, and &quot;Mayonaise&quot; cause reflection and  introspection on the listener's part, creating a more balanced record.  The  true killers on this album, though, are &quot;Today' and &quot;Soma&quot;.   The first is the most melodic alternative rock ever written, while the  second is the most sobering alt-rock ever written.  In closing, while the  Pumpkins may not be sure who they are anymore, I'll always love them for  who they were.
B0000047CX|5.0|Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.  This CD is sooooo smooth, just to listen to, to study by, or to enchant your mate by.  It goes down smoother than an amaretto sour; I promise you won't be disappointed.  I listen to this all  the time, and all my friends ask me to borrow it for their best dates.   &quot;Smooth&quot; is the word, yo.
B000002MTR|5.0|I must admit, I like the Chili Peppers a lot more with John than I did with Dave Navarro, but in it's own right, this is an incredible album. It contains some interesting twists in the Chili Peppers' sound. There are  more rock, guitar driven songs on here than on other Chili Peppers albums,  due to Dave's style. A must buy for any Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.
B000001ESF|4.0|THE BAND: Geddy Lee (bass), Alex Lifeson (electric & acoustic guitars), Neal Peart (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1976) 6 songs clocking in at approximately 39 minutes. This digitally remastered version was released in 1997. The disc contains a 3-page foldout containing band pictures, song credits, lyrics, and thank you's. All music written by the 3 band members. All lyrics written by Peart, except for \\"Lessons\\" by Lee. Recorded at Toronto Sound Studios in Toronto, Ontario. Label - Mercury.<br /><br />COMMENTS: The \\"2112 Overature\\" consists of 7 distinct parts; a few hard and fast, some slow, electric then acoustic, and a bombastic grand finale... almost 21 minutes worth - it covers the gambit. The 5 remaining songs are each between 3-4 minutes. \\"A Passage To Bangkok\\" takes you aboard the Thailand Express through Bogota, Columbia, Morocco, Bangkok, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Katmandu, and Nepal in search of the best weed. The acoustic \\"Lessons\\" is one of my favorite songs on the disc; while the ultra mellow \\"Tears\\" is probably my least. Is it possible to say that \\"2112\\" sounds dated, but is still fresh by progressive standards? This album has the decade of the glorious 70's stamped all over it. Where the band's debut, \\"Caress Of Steel\\", and \\"Fly By Night\\" showed incredible potential, \\"2112\\" shows that they are professionals - tight musicianship and a slick and polished sound - coming into their game. The mid 70's had Rush trying to prove themselves - full of vitality and great song writing. As good as they proved themselves on \\"2112\\", global greatness was just around the corner with \\"Permanent Waves\\" (1980) and \\"Moving Pictures\\" (1981). Great disc.
B00001ZUGJ|5.0|This video/DVD was wild and weird! Just the way I like them!  If you like sci-fi -this is one for you.
B00000J2KT|5.0|Probably Kubrick's most underrated film and probably met with the most indifference, and I can't understand why.  I can't understand why it wasn't on AFI's top 100 (same with Barry Lyndon and The Shining).  I can't  understand why Lee Ermey didn't nab an Oscar, and the movie didn't win best  picture or at least best screenplay.  This world is just so unfair.  On the  outside it first appears to be one of the most cynical, hard-hearted,  unsentimental movies ever made.  But look closer:  the subtext in this  movie is so gutwrenching and emotional, it's like the film is crying  INSIDE.  Just look at Private Pyle's murder/suicide scene--so tragic, so  honest!  It blows me away.
B000002JSJ|5.0|THE BAND: Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitars), John Paul Jones (bass, piano/keyboards), John Bonham (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1976) 7 songs clocking in at approximately 44 minutes. The digitally remastered version released in 1994. Album #7. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song titles/credits (no lyrics or bonus tracks), and all original album artwork. All songs written by Page/Plant, except \\"Royal Orleans\\" by all 4 band members. Recorded at Musicland Studios, Munich, Germany. Label - Swan Song / Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: A classic. I feel this is Led Zeppelin's most underrated album. Perhaps because none of the songs really made a dent on the FM airwaves. I've read in several different places that \\"Presence\\" contains Jimmy Page's favorite song - the 10+ minute \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" -  dense production including redub after redub and layers of guitars playing side by side. This song, along with \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" happen to be two of my absolute favorite songs in their entire catalog. Page's guitar work is amazing, not to mention the catchy song/melody itself. Another mid tempo rocker \\"Hots On For Nowhere\\" and the slow and bluesy \\"For Your Life\\" are also classic Zep tunes. \\"Presence\\" came out quickly - taking 3 weeks to record - and stayed at the #1 spot for a mere 2 weeks... and then disappeared. Robert Plant had been recovering from a bad car accident and reviewers were wondering if he had fully recovered... that there was more actual singing, then his normal wailing and screeching. An essential Led Zeppelin album (5 stars).
6304432461|5.0|Talk about a bad day...  imagine being in a building, filled with terrorists armed to the teeth with weaponry and missiles, hostages have been taken, the whole building wired to explode, and all that John  McClane(Bruce Willis) has is a handgun.  Just to matters worse, he's  barefoot.  That's a bad day, and he overcomes it in this action packed  film.  With the help of a police officer from the outside (Reginald  VelJohnson)  he tries to stop the terrorists, and save his wife(Bonnie  Bedelia) who is also a hostage.
0060926317|5.0|This book reminded me to remember the things I have forgotten.  She had the courage to write it and hopefully you will have the courage to read it.  It will help you re-balance the way you think about life and what you are  capable of.

Included in this digitally remastered version is a 10-page booklet with song credits and lyrics. Recorded at Stargroves, England. Label - Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" has always been my favorite Zeppelin album... simply because the songs are so varied. Some of my all time favorite rockers (\\"The Song Remains The Same\\", \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\", \\"Dancing Days\\", \\"The Ocean\\"); the 7 minute long ballad (\\"The Rain Song\\"); the hip reggae (\\"D'yer Mak'er\\"), the offbeat (The Crunge\\"); and the disturbing (\\"No Quarter\\"). \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" had mild success (in America) back when it was released... \\"D'yer Mak'er reached #20 on the U.S. pop charts, and \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" reached #51. I rank \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" right along side \\"Physical Graffiti\\" and \\"Zoso/#4\\" as Zeppelin's best releases. Classic disc.
B000006NPY|4.0|If you have an open mind, like The Pumpkins themselves, you will appreciate &quot;Adore&quot; for the magnificent album that it truly is.   I want to stand on the roof tops and tell everyone they're wrong for  snubbing this album. Forgive my melodrama . . . this album struck a  profoundly personal chord in me.    Billy lost his wife to divorce, and his  mom passed away. I lost my first love at the tender age of sixteen, 1998.    When Billy mourned his losses through the incredible beauty of his music,  my soul was set free from my own personal grief, at least momentarily.    &quot;For Martha&quot; is the saddest, loveliest, and most powerful song to  describe the loss of a loved one. In my opinion, it is one of the best  Pumpkins songs of all time. The piano chords and raw, painful lyrics brings  tears to my eyes. I will never forget this song for it described how I felt  when I let go of my first love, finally . . .   &quot;Behold the  Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Shame&quot; are also beautfil albeit sullen odes  that evoke somber truths.    The upbeat tunes, &quot;Ava ADore&quot;,  &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;, and &quot;Perfect&quot; are also wonderful.     This album is tattooed in my mind. Like true art, it reflects life and  perserves faith and belief in the human race.   Thank you, Billy Corgan,  for making this album.
6303481272|4.0|Usually when martial arts action flicks are made, things like character development and a decent plot are placed on the backburner. It's refreshing to see a martial arts anime that delivers on all counts.<br />The first thing  you'll notice are the incredible visuals. The artwork and animation are  superb, with a realistic style seen too rarely in anime. The voice acting  was also pretty good. Kagaro could've been voiced a little better, but she  was passable.<br />While the premise (lone ninja takes on various bad guys)  sounds typical of this genre, the plot actually has some depth to it. It  even gets somewhat confusing at times, and has enough intrigue and plot  twists to keep things interesting.<br />The characters are another strong  point. The hero, Jubei, is your typical lone-wolf tough guy, but he has  enough charisma to get by. He is supported by Kagaro, a female ninja, and  Dakuwan, who reminds me of Yoda.<br />The villains featured, are simply  excellent. Each of the Eight Devils of Kimon are unique in appearance,  style, and personality (or lack of it). They also (thankfully) do not  appear in successive order of toughness.<br />But what about the main reason  for watching a film of this genre: pure martial arts action. The action  sequences are inventive with some neat tricks on part of the combatants.  Most of the time things are relatively believable, except for a couple  bits. In one sequence, a rather exaggerated battle is staged as Jubei falls  into the &quot;hero loses it and everyone dies&quot; cliche. There are also  a couple of unnecessary romantic sappy moments. Some people may disagree,  but I found the whole romantic subplot a little corny.<br />Aside from a  couple eye-rolling moments, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. For great  martial arts action, Ninja Scroll is probably the best of its genre.
B000000OQ5|5.0|THE BAND: Jeff Keith (vocals), Tommy Skeoch (guitars), Frank Hannon (guitars, keyboards), Brian Wheat (bass), Troy Luccketta (drums & percussion). Hometown: Sacramento, CA.<br /><br />THE DISC: (1986) 12 tracks clocking in at just under 54 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet containing a 2-page intro to the making of the band, musicians, song titles/credits/times, and thank you's. All songs written by Tesla members except \\"Little Suzi\\" (Diamond/Hymas). Recorded at Bearsville Studios, Bearsville, NY. Label - Geffen.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Start your Tesla collection with THIS album. \\"Mechanical Resonance\\" absolutely rocks. No filler - one blistering song after another. The album reached #32 on the Billboard charts. Certified radio hits with \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" and \\"Little Suzi\\". Mild successes with \\"Changes\\", \\"Getting' Betta\\" and \\"Cumin' Atcha Live\\". 4 of the 5 here (minus \\"Cumin Atcha Live\\") made it to their \\"Time's Makin' Changes - The Best Of Tesla\\" disc. 5 songs from this album made it to their \\"Five Man Acoustical Jam\\" (1990) disc. \\"Mechanical Res\\" starts off fast and stays that way through track 7... with the exception of the slow and bluesy \\"We're No Good Together\\". The last 4 songs lean toward the slower/pop side. Simply a classic rock album (5 stars).<br /><br />Behind the name - Nikola TESLA: Inventor, engineer, scientist... born: 1856 (Austria), died: 1943 (New York City).

B000000WA4|5.0|The great thing about the Smashing Pumpkins is that they are blessed with versatility. Mellon-Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the pinnacle of the creative and artistic explosion of Smashing Pumpkins.   I got this album  when I was a freshman in high school. It LITERALLY described my whole life.  &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; is so powerful. &quot;Beautiful&quot; was THEE  song that described my FIRST LOVE, 1997;I'll never forget it for as long as  I live.    This album captures literally every single emotional experience  of anyone--not just adolescents. Love--&quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;cupid  de locke&quot;, &quot;in the arms of sleep&quot; (THAT SONG IS SO BEAUTIFUL  I FREAGIN' SWEAR). Apathy--&quot;to forgive&quot;. Anger --&quot;bullet  with butterfly wings&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;XYU&quot;. Happiness  &quot;Muzzle&quot;, &quot;33&quot;.    This aLBUM IS UNFORGETTABLE!  It  is true ART.
B00003CX7K|5.0|I saw this movie four times while it was in theatres.  I saw the prequel, and loved that also.  This movie was hilarious, dramatic at times, and just a good 'ol time.  I loved hearing the familiar Tim Allen and Tom Hanks.  They are certainly a good team.  I am sure this movie will go to infinity  and beyond!
B000001ESN|5.0|THE BAND: Geddy Lee (bass, mini moog, synth), Neil Peart (drums, tympani, bells, chimes & assorted percussion), Alex Lifeson (electric & acoustic guitars).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1980) 6 songs digitally remastered clocking in at approximately 36 minutes. Along with the disc there is a 3-page foldout with band pictures, lyrics and thank you's. All music written by Lee and Lifeson. All lyrics written by Peart. Recorded at Le Studio, Morin-Heights, Quebec. Label - Mercury.<br /><br />COMMENTS: In my opinion, \\"Permanent Waves\\" contains the band's 1st big smash hit \\"Spirit Of The Radio\\". Followed by a smaller hit \\"Freewill\\". This album is an early rock and progressive masterpiece. Gone are the tradional 20 minute prog jams. Rush had radio success (largely North American) on prior albums - hits like \\"Fly By Night\\", \\"Working Man\\", and \\"Closer To The Heart\\", but none equalled the power or execution of \\"Spirit Of The Radio\\". Peart, Lifeson, and Lee are each incredible musicians and it's evident on this album (and all others for that matter)... slick, polished and professional. Two of my favorite deep album Rush tunes are here - the 7 minute \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and the 9 minute \\"Natural Science\\". The remastered sound features deep bass tones and crisp cymbal crashes. Classic disc.
0671449028|5.0|Some children's books are just classics, this is certainly one.<br />I've read it so often to my little girl that I can say the whole thing by heart.  By the way she has dozens of books, but picks this one out again and  again.<br />Sandra Boynton seems to have a very special understanding of what  children like.
6305750750|3.0|&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; had some elements which seemed obviously directed to a non-adult audience, but nothing compared to this flick. Some movies, like &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, can succeed at this level, by  offering a satirical edge in addition to the fantasy element (which is more  appealing to the youthful crowd); even pure fantasy movies  (&quot;Brazil&quot; or &quot;Willow&quot;) can be appealing to adults. But  this is clearly a kid's movie, since the main character is 11 or so. I  realize that, in order to set up the eventual parts 4,5, and 6 (or  whatever), the characters need to start out young. That's no excuse for  making Star Wars into a kid's film (I mean, even &quot;Flight of the  Navigator&quot; can be entertaining to an adult; this wasn't.). I'm just  glad I didn't bother to see this in the theater.
B000001EAQ|5.0|From behind all the glitter , 'Pop' comes through as a genuine rocker. U2's genius is in taking a genre like this and still make an album of great songs. Probably the only band that can afford to make a potentially  dangerous move towards techno.. There may be no immediate commercial gain  for them, but this album will be played long after techno bands become  history. 'Mofo' is great, if a little disturbing, 'If God will send his  angels' is one of the best U2 songs of that decade, 'Playboy Mansion' is an  interesting view of pop culture.And 'Discotheque' is an upbeat lead-off  song, despite the 'Chewing Gum' line :) Now the question is, What next?

6305014140|5.0|After watching this movie you say wow!  the animation in this anime is top notch. The characters in this movie are amazing and intriging and the hero is almost invincible. This movie is about a plague that hits a village and  a team of ninjas are sent to invesitgate there is only one who survives a  ninja woman and she is rescued by the main character Jubei. The villians  are called the 8 devils of koman that worship the shogun of the dark. I  recommend this movie for teenagers and adults.
B000002U82|5.0|I never really considered myself a Pink Floyd fan, sure I've heard the &quot;hits&quot; on the radio, I liked &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, but I wasn't sure what to expect when I put this album into my CD player.<br />Turns  out I was missing one hell of a record. Wow. I put this thing in around one  in the morning, put on the headphones and climbed into bed to listen and  was immediately awestruck.<br />From the opening, somewhat ominious heartbeat,  that opens the journey and flows into &quot;Speak to Me/Breathe&quot; till  the end of the album (which fades out with the same heartbeat), I was  mesmerized.<br />Great songs, like &quot;Time&quot;, with clocks chiming their  alarms in the beginning, &quot;Money&quot; with coins clinking and cash  registers ringing (and an awesome saxophone solo), &quot;Us And Them&quot;,  &quot;Brain Damage&quot; (complete with Englishmen talking and laughing  during the song) and &quot;Eclipse&quot;. Excellent lyrics.<br />I'm not  concerned with the Waters vs. Gilmour stuff or whether this is the best  album of all-time, I just know what I like, and this was a lot of fun to  listen to and I plan on much more listening in the future. Enjoy.
8185300453|5.0|This is a book for the serious spiritual seeker. It points to the most basic of all facts: &quot;What you are, you already are. By knowing what you are not, you are free of it and remain in your own natural state.&quot;  Nisargadatta Maharaj is truly a rare light. Rather than dispelling darkness  he helps us awaken to understanding that darkness is merely an illusion...  a mirage.  I know of no one who can aid you more on that journey than  Nisargadatta Maharaj.
B00000J7J4|1.0|don't be fooled: even if you're a fan of the artists in question, this collection is the bottom-end of their output.
0375703764|5.0|Of course I picked up this book with skepticism.  Most of the &quot;literature&quot; today is fluff, and one must wade through the mire to get to something truly worthwhile.<br />House of Leaves is, of course, not  for everyone. Fans of Eco, Calvino, Borges, et al. will delight in the  metafiction that Danielewski has created. The footnotes and appendices  serve to enhance the Navidson record while also making it even more real.  Without them, the story is less exciting.<br />The House of Leaves not only  contains the Navidson record, but it contains the books that Danielewski  has created- not written, mind you, but created- the footnotes that are  fake create the ideas for texts that could have been written, just as the  Navidson record creates the film that it recollects.<br />The book is not a  horror novel, but rather, one that makes you think and question dimensions,  relations, and space.<br />Truly not for the faint of mind, or those who do  not want to think about their entertainment. For those who want to judge  the book, the sprawling mess that leads to the overwhelming nothingness  that is the House of Leaves.
B000002MG1|5.0|Every few decades, an album comes out that is so intensely genuine and personal that it alters the way we perceive music entirely, and so in that tradition came R.E.M.'s Automatic For the People, a moody reflection on  mortality, beauty, memory, fame, and our human gravitation towards each.   Built on a layered foundation of deep-rooted but subtle acoustic strings  and orchestral pomp, R.E.M.'s melodic pop sensibility textures sonic genius  onto a palette equal parts haunting and uplifting.  It is a pensive record  that's not as despairing as it first might seem, its most profound message  urging us to break the chains of our inherent cynicism and discover  humanity where we least expect it...  Automatic For the People is an album  so emotionally direct, like a locked diary in shroud, that people I know  resist discussing it, equating it with their own humanness and  vulnerability... This is R.E.M.'s greatest achievement yet. Best Tracks:  &quot;Sweetness Follows,&quot; &quot;Man On the Moon,&quot;  &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; Rating: 10/10
B00000064G|5.0|Like many others, I first heard Nick Drake on the television, in that VW ad.  It was late at night when it came on, the perfect time for anything by Nick to be played, and the song just grabbed me, something that many things  on television try to do but few actually manage it.  That night I fell  asleep with that soft, silky voice whispering the words to 'pink moon' over  and over again inside my head.  By the end of the week, I had found out who  sang the song, bought the album, and listened to it countless  times.<br />'Pink Moon' is, without a doubt, the most beatiful album ever  recorded.  It's also the saddest.  You can practically see the tear that  trickles down Nick's cheek as he sings the 11 songs that make up the album,  accompanied only by his own guitar and a short piano overdub on the title  track.  Beauty...<br />Thank you, Volkswagen, for bringing Nick Drake to the  world, and for having the foresight to put a link to his most beautiful  work on your site, so that I and so many others, could come to know and  love him.
0156465116|5.0|This is written for children and ADOLT. I am a Japanses, so I read this book by Japanese. I impressed very much! so, I wanted to read by English.(I want to read by French,but imposible)  There are many Japanese like me.This book is popular in Japan too!
B00003CWN3|5.0|The true story behind &quot;Boys don't Cry&quot; tells about crimes committed, lousy judgment, and bad company.  Kimberly Pierce includes it all but still manages to show a loving courageous person who mixed  practicality and sensitivity with a stubborn desire to live a full life on  his terms. Hilary Swank deserved the Oscar for her affecting performance as  a transsexual trapped by lies and circumstances but never giving up on his  dreams. The film was deep and honest and I loved it.
0451169514|5.0|I have read this book twice, the first literally without putting it down, the second over the course of a couple weeks. It is an amazingly scary book, and it freaked me out both times i read it.<br />This is my favorite  book of all time, and while Stephen King's The Stand was higher on the  Millenium list, this is still im my opinion the better of the two.<br />So, if  you haven't yet, buy this book! Read it! Be scared! :)

Es ist ein wunderbar spannendes und fesselndes Buch, sehr phantasievoll und sehr gut geschrieben noch dazu.  Auf den ber dreihundert Seiten ist Spannung  angesagt.  Man kann es jedem empfehlen, gross oder klein, alle werden von  ihm begeistert sein.

B00000IQW3|4.0|If you are a big Sci Fi fan but can only afford one or two DVD's a month (like me), you might want to put this on your &quot;later&quot; list. Dont getta me wrongo, this dvd is great, the plot (a young guy called in for a  mission in another galaxy, thanks to his arcade gaming skills) is a solid  story that develops nicely throughout the film, the special effects were  ahead of its time and the acting is pretty solid. The thing here is you  might find the story too much for children - they're going to love it - if  you set your expectations too high. If you're looking for a fun movie, this  is a good choice, if you want &quot;serious&quot; Sic Fi, you might want to  look at other options like &quot;2001&quot; or &quot;Silent Running&quot;.
0140282033|2.0|I found this book simplistic, naive, and heavy-handed.  It would have been better with more complex and ambiguous characters.
B00003CWL5|4.0|A bit uneven and scattered, without enough time spent on the film's narrator, but still an aesthetically rich and uniquely engaging film about overpriveledged white suburbanites finding themselves face-to-face with all  of the unhealthy psychological baggage that pervades overpriveledged white  suburban culture as a whole, with two particular characters learning to  ring some beauty out of the mess by adopting a perspective uncannily  reminiscent of Taoism. Whew, what a long sentence. It may sound like I'm  picking on the movie, but I'm not -- it is well-executed, powerful,  touching, inspiring, and surprisingly (for a popular American drama/comedy)  promotive of a self-reliance bordering on optimistic hedonism. It's a  refreshing movie in this respect, and it is full of extremely interesting  characters. They are hyperbolized, as are their revelations and  confrontations, it's true, but that doesn't mean that real and significant  issues are not being addressed (I say this in response to reviews  complaining that the movie doesn't accurately reflect life as it  &quot;really is.&quot;) The people who walked out of this movie muttering  &quot;That was good, but everybody was so WEIRD&quot; are, I think, missing  the point, not to mention giving a good indication of how culturally  scripted they themselves (as well as their aesthetic expectations) are.

0375701427|5.0|In American Pastoral, Phillip Roth presents a view of American life and the typical American dream of the 1960's.  Through the voice of a bystander, Roth takes his readers into a world filled with not only love  and adoration, but also hate and rebellion.  The story is based on the life  and fate of a man that seemed to be exempt from harm throughout almost  almost his entire life.  The stinging, but eventual downfall to Seymour  &quot;Swede&quot; Levov's life is a bitter but heartwrenching tale about a  father's unconditional love for his daughter.<br />Swede Lelov led his life in  a way that others marvelled and adored.  During a time of war, Swede made  his town forget about  part of their world, and instead, focus on his  outstanding athletic skill.  &quot;Through the Swede, the neighborhood  entered into a fantasy about itself and about the world...our families  could forget the way things actually work and make an athletic performance  the repository of their hopes.  Primarily, they could forget the war&quot;  (p.3-4).  The Swede's life took away the everyday pain of all the others  around him.<br />The  Swede then retreats further into the typical American  success story and becomes a war hero, then later continues his family's  business into prosperous new heights.  To top off the dream life, he ends  up marrying the former Miss New Jersey.  A novel that starts out as a fairy  tale ends in upheavel and loss, and truly shows the American Dream of the  60's demolished by political radicalism and everything else that surrounds  it.  The  Swede's daughter Merry plants a fatal bomb in the local post  office and ends up killing a doctor.  It &quot;Brought the war home to  Lyndon Johnson by blowing up the post office in the general store&quot;  (p.68).  In an attempt to make an anti-war statement, Merry not only brings  the war home emotionally, but quite physically.  For  &quot;Swede&quot;,  &quot;That bomb detonated his life.  His perfect life was over&quot;  (p.69).<br />The quintessential American dream that Swede Lelov's life was  based on was completely shattered with the bomb.  The  Swede's life  deteriorates right in front of the readers' eyes.  His wife is committed  into a mental hospital as the result of her not being able to deal with her  daughter's actions, and this loss of his wife is followed by the eventual  phyisical loss of his daughter (since he lost her emotionally many years  ago).  As a final downfall in his life,  Swede's own health deteriorates at  a rapid pace and he is left not only with the loss of the two women in his  life, but also the feelings of failure and anguish over his life (that at  once seemed unbelievably perfect).<br />Roth presents an  ironical end to a  life that seemed to start so brightly.  A lesson is learned through Roth's  powerful words that readers will have no choice but to take to heart.   American Pastoral is an excellent novel that brought world events close to  home.  The novel not only tells the story of a tragic family downfall, but  also a tragic human downfall.  Merry's actions serve as a righteous symbol  for what was going on around the world and how the society's ignorance and  denial of the war caused their own downfall.<br />Roth's characterization is  what truly brings the story together.   &quot;Swede's&quot; initial  coldness leaves the readers unable to understand and truly feel his  magnificance, but through Roth's brilliant writing, as  Swede's life falls  down, so do the walls that surround his character.  The readers are let  into the world of an extremely heartbroken and emotional man.  Through his  trials and tribulations, readers are able to not only feel for his tragedy,  but also for the tragedy of the world surrounding him.<br />An additional  note: The story touched me in a personal way, so excuse me if I'm biased.   Not only my parents, but I also grew up in Newark, where the story is set.   Being able to follow through the town's history in sucha manner, made me   feel so much more in touch with the novel.  I felt like i was not only a  reader of this world, but actually present in it.  No matter what my biases  are though, i would still be able to confidently  comment that American  Pastoral is an  excellent read, and more than worthwhile....

B00002E233|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, But I couldn't bring myself to say anything positive about the movie.The acting the direction and the computerized sharks had me reaching for the remote. I am a huge fan of Jaws  and I know it is really unfair to compare the two films, But I'll take the  rubber shark over BAD CGI any day of the week. The disc on the other hand  is loaded with extras and looks and sounds great. So I give the Film 1 star  and the Dvd 4 stars. If I were you i'd spare yourself the agony of watching  the film and wait for Jaws to be released in July. You'll be a lot happier.
B000002J09|1.0|So, you've heard people rave about Led Zeppelin and you want to see if they really are that good?READ THIS CAREFULLY- I first bought an album of thiers back in 1987,listened to it,borrowed all the rest of their  albums,and listened to them many times again.Since then I've put on their  records from time to time and you know what? I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT  PEOPLE SEE IN THEM.They are one of the biggest scams in music history.
B000009ED0|4.0|When I bought this album I was told off by some ignorant clerk saying that the album was full of profanity.  SCREW HER!   If I didn't buy this album I would have never known such classics as Only God Knows Why and I Am The  Bullgod.  So the album is cuss-laden, what really matters is music and  attitude, right?  Well this album does both to a great extent.  This album  is the perfect mix of old school hip hop and bluesy, good ol' rock n' roll.   The best songs are Only God Knows Why, which is my favorite song of all  time and I Am The Bullgod which sounds so much like Lynard Skynard, it's  scary.  I've hated rap music all my life until I heard this CD.  If you  like the stuff that you heard on the radio, pick this one up.
0385484518|5.0|This book really will make you look at your life in review.  You will think of all the friends you have met at one point in your life, and how quickly you forgot them.  As a high school senior, it made me think of all  the people I have met here (in school) and how in less than a month I will  never see them again.        This book will make you laugh and cry.  It is  so touching.  I think it is because it is not just a story, but it really  is a life long lesson.       While it entertains you like most books, it  also forces you to do a reality check.   You do NOT need to read this book  if you don't want to think about all the people you've been a horrible  person to, and all the bad things you've done.  BUT...if you want to see  yourself and your attitude through different eyes and you are able to face  life, think about death and open to changing the way you live, you NEED to  read this book.  It will change your life and the way you look at your  life.
B000002NFM|3.0|THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE MUCH OF A REVIEW, AS IT IS A COMMENT ON THE OFTEN MISLABELED TERMS USED IN UNDERGROUND DANCE MUSIC AND CULTURE! FIRST OFF, THIS IS NOT DRUM AND BASS AS I FOUND IT LISTED HERE. SECOND, &quot;THE  PRODIGY&quot; REALLY GET MAD WHEN THEY ARE LABELED AS  &quot;ELECTRONICA&quot; I OWN THIS CD, IT'S NOT REALLY MY THING, I REALLY  APPRICIATE THIS BANDS TALENT AND INGENUITY!  IF YOU WANT THE FULL PRODIGY  EXPERIENCE, THEIR LIVE SHOW IS PURE MADNESS, I CAN'T IMAGINE A BAD SHOW  FROM THIS BAND.  DON'T QUOTE ME ON THIS BUT I BELIEVE THE FUTURE OF THE  BAND IS IN DOUBT. IF SO THEY HAVE DEFINITLY LEFT A VERY DISTINCTIVE MARK  UPON OUR MUSIC WORLD!
B00000J6AG|5.0|With Play, Moby combines his creativity with a generous heaping of musical savvy to create his most success offering yet. And what a soulful, joyful album he's shared with us.  <br />From start to finish, Play is an aural  delight.  The highlights may be &quot;Honey,&quot; &quot;Porcelain,&quot;  &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad,&quot; &quot;Natural Blues,&quot; and  &quot;Run On,&quot; but nearly all the remaining songs hit the spot,  too.<br />The first half of the album consists largely of lovely, hymn-like  songs (with the exception of the dancefloor-ready &quot;Bodyrock), while  Moby gets to explore his ambient roots more on the second half.  This way  he smartly snags the more commercial listeners with his hooky opening  material, so that maybe they'll stay along for the rest of the ride and a  for bit of an education.<br />As you've probably already read, on many of the  songs, Moby threads samples from old blues songs (specifically the Alan  Lomax field recordings from &quot;Sounds of the South&quot;) into his own  electronic compositions.  In the hands of a lesser composer (and  &quot;composer&quot; is a title that fits Moby better than many of his  contemporaries), this device could easily come off as stilted and gimmicky.   Instead, Moby makes these musically anachronistic styles flow seamlessly,  and the results are both organic and infectious. It's not that others  haven't done this sort of thing before; they just haven't done it this  well. <br />Moby is definitely a musician who follows his own path, and as he  finds his way, he's finally getting the attention and praise he deserves.  Play is one of the finest releases of 1999.
B0000399WI|5.0|When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption years ago in theaters, I was floored.  This DVD preserves all the spendor and vast cinematography of the big screen and proves to be an absolute winner for repeat viewings.  Tim  Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unbelievably relaxed, effortless  performances, not to mention the often overlooked heart wrenching  performance by James Whitmore as Brooks Hadlen.  The stark visions of  prison contrast beautifully with the luminoisity of freedom.  The framing  and cinematography are nothing short of breathtaking.  The flawless passage  of 19 years during the course of the movie takes us on a lovely journey  full of hope, friendship and inspiration.  Truly one of the most  signifigant cinematic achievements ever...a gem to be cherished for years  to come.  Buy it and be moved...
B000002UJQ|5.0|I started listening to Radiohead one night when I saw a spotlight on Muchmusic, and heard High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, etc, and I bought The Bends, and was immediately hooked. Already deep into The Bends, I  bought Ok Computer, and boom, my respect for Radiohead skyrocketed. Upon  first listen I found most of the songs catchy... from the cool bass, and  drums in Airbag, to the surreal feel of Let Down, to the simple and  majestic opening to No Surprises. Then as time past I began getting into  the rest of the CD... But the true genious to this CD, in my opinion, as  with Pink Floyd, is the subtle sounds in the backgroud which add to the  atmosphere and effect. I find this CD a lot like Pink Floyd in the use of  subtle sounds, and effects. The Dark Side of the Moon has so many effects  in the background, and the only real way to catch them all is in a silent  room with headphones on. This is the same with Ok Computer. As I listened  to it with my headphones on I began to get into the music, and really get  it. From the cool chainsaw in Paranoid Android which adds to the insane  feel of the song, to the cool computer sounds in Let Down which adds to the  surrealness... When I listened to this with headphones on the title made  sense to me... Its like a surreal, fantastic journey through your PC...  This is a CD that never gets boring... every listen brings something new,  and this is why I love it soo much... that plus the intoxicating  melodies... Definately a must have...
0679746048|4.0|I loved this book b/cause it was a true story. .......   Especially when they described everyone.  I think that the part where Daisy dropped her ice cream was funny.
B00004S6GL|4.0|A great follow up to XO.  Once again, Elliott shows us what john Lennon would have sounded like if he were a better pianist, not to mention alive.  The songs aren't quite as complicated as on XO, but all are strong  offerings of Smith's style.  Particularly memorable is the ragtime  influenced &quot;Angelina.&quot;
6305531374|1.0|First off, A NO STAR rating for this crap! Mrs. Curtis a.k.a. Jamie Lee came back on this ego trip to exorcise her so-called type casting. Her  self-serving influence reeks in this terrible plot. For someone who echos  Halloween made her career possible, she seems awfully resentful of her  Halloween past. Calling out Michael and then conveniently has him at her  mercy to behead him. What a joke, who wrote this excrement? If not for  Myers presence, this would have taken the title from Halloween III as the  worst. The teen, garbage actors are a disgrace. They would have been better  off casting mannequins. Is ll cool j (or what ever he calls himself) an  actor? He's not even a musician. But, that's another story. As long as we  pump the money into these inferior works, Hollywood will continue to  produce such crap. Like, Halloween III, this one is forgotten. Turn the  page. Save your money for the release of H2K. Hopefully, they'll get it  right this time. Another example of how bad the industry has become.
B000005JA8|1.0|Zero stars if possible! All the worst parts of Frank Zappa's style of music wrapped up into one 70 minute abysmal nightmare.  Nothing goes as far as being listenable, and any artistic endeavor is completely covered up by  the gratuitous instrumental numbers that go absolutely nowhere.
B00000J2KX|5.0|This must be my all-time favorite. I think this is the scarriest film I have ever seen. Not in a way you fall out of your chair suddenly, but it was constantly scary. The hotel is totally empty (except for the family)  and very quiet, but sometimes there are a lot of people, dancing and  drinking. These imaginations are worked out really good. If you haven't  seen this film yet, go kick yourself and make sure you see this film ASAP!
068484267X|5.0|Angelas Ashes is a fantastic book.  It shows us just how good we have it.  It is a great memoir both funny and forgiving.  Frank McCourt is stunning and will leave an impression on every readers mind.<br />It's about a boy living in poverty that has a drunken father and a begging mother.  He has  an abusive teacher and abusive relatives.  He lives in an ally where  everybody throws their wastes to the streets,and smells rank all the time.   To read this book you have to understand it from the beginning to the end.   I would recomend this book to ages 15and up, because it was hard for me to  read and understand and i am only 14.
B00001ODHL|5.0|Army of Darkness is not a horror movie.  It's more of a satire of the genre.  Although it takes place where Evil Dead 2 ends, it really has nothing to do with the rest of the series.  Evil Dead was a excellent  horror film.  Evil Dead 2 was a remake of the first with dark humor thrown  in, creating another excellent film.  Army of Darkness is full of  comedy....and not much else.  But that's okay, by the time you finish  watching it, you don't feel robbed.  That's the power of Sam Raimi and  Bruce Campbell.
6305078564|5.0|Wow.  Jane Austen's genius is visible here, her characters may wear period clothes and talk kinda funny, but they're all people we know.<br />The Bennet girls, their social climbing mother, weak father, and verra intriguing  neighbors comprise this story.  Elizabeth Bennet, the wittiest and smartest  of the girls is our heroine, played wonderfully by Jennifer Ehle. Colin  Firth is Fitzwilliam Darcy, an arrogant twit whose first proposal to  Elizabeth doesn't go all that well, but in the end, he sees that he has  behaved &quot;abominably&quot; and makes it all okay.<br />The secondary  characters are well drawn and well portrayed.  Ms Collins (David Bamber) is  hilarious, Lydia and Mr. Wickham truly deserve each other, and Lady  Catherine de Bourgh gets hers in the end.<br />Delightful adaptation of  Austen's classic.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|What can you say about Evil Dead?  Okay, so it isn't the greatest film ever made, but it is definately one of the best &quot;people trapped in a cabin and chop each other to peices&quot; horror films of all time.  What  is lacks in plot; characters; and acting, Evil Dead makes up with style.   The DVD version of this film contains two audio tracks, one by Raimi and  Producer Tabert, and the other with Bruce Campbell.  In a genre where the  same movie has been made over and over again, it's nice to see that someone  tries hard to be original.
B00004RFDW|5.0|I am a Kevin Spacey fan, but in all honesty, Russell deserved to win just as much.  This performance is brilliant, the story of Jeffrey Wigand masterfully portrayed and the struggle to bring it to 60 Minutes so well  done, that I am amazed at how little exposure this film had.
0767817451|4.0|Yeah, okay, this is a good, thrilling movie with cool special effects and a scary monster, but it is not Godzilla!  At least, it's not to me.  It doesn't even look like Godzilla, it looks like a giant iguana!  If you want  real Godzilla action, check out the old Japanese movies.  They may be  corny, but they're way better than this.  Even &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot; is  better.  As a movie, it's not too bad, but as a Godzilla movie, it's  nothing.  It probably wouldn't hurt to skip this, or at least go in not  expecting greatness.  In summation: old Godzilla good, new Godzilla bad!
0790729628|5.0|Of concern is that as of yet is not forseen an edition of Scott's Blade Runner in DvD with audio features such as 5.1 or better DTS. Are the technical  problems really so unsourmantable? Every problem has a solution,  perhaps further research, work, thinking and planning are required. Really  hope so. Thank You for allowing this &quot;ideas&quot; space Sincerely  Yours E.A.
6300214753|5.0|Wow, what a great, hilarious movie!  Why can't they make stuff like this anymore?  All of today's teen movies are so lame.  This tells the story of a crafty high school kid (Matthew Broderick, at his best)who plots to skip  school with his best friend (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend (Mia Sara).  Seems like a simple plot, but the movie, undoubtedly, is hilarious.  It's  one of those movies you could watch over and over, and never get tired of  it.  My only compaint is that they could have had some better music  featured in it, being that it was in the time period it was in, and that it  featured wild and crazy teenagers.  Y'know, Scorps, GNR, Metallica.  But,  oh well.  In conclusion, do check out this movie if you have not.  It is  old, but great.
6303036570|5.0|I just loved this movie, (but Scarface is my all-time favorite).  Al Pacino is just a great actor.  My favorite scenes were the &quot;cheesecake&quot; scene and the &quot;train station&quot; scene,  (very, very sexy and very, very exciting).  Up until the end of the movie I  found myself cheering him on, until Bennie Blanco shows his face, and then,  oh well just see the movie okay!
6305718903|4.0|Being Roman Catholic, I should have found this offensive, but then I realized what it was: a movie. A block of plastic that I shove into a box of plastic connected to a larger box of plastic with a glass part on it.  The plot was good, and the acting was good. The intriguing part was, that,  instead of being possessed by that wretched Bill Gates--Err Satan, she's  possessed by a disgruntled ex-priest. I do not appreciate the way the  Catholic Church, Jesus Christ, and large gaudy yellow rings were portrayed  in this movie, however. Worthy of at least a rental, unless you're easily  offended.
6300183211|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Al Pacino IS Tony Montana/Scarface!   So there's the &quot;chainsaw&quot; scene.  And then there's the &quot;say hello to my little friend&quot; scene.  (And I kind  of liked the scene when he goes to see his mother and she practically  disown's him, but he does not disrespect her in any way.  What a guy!)  But  my favorite scene is when Tony looks up in the sky and sees the air ship  that reads, &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;.  That scene gets me every time.   I mean, Al just does a superb job of letting you know what he's thinking.   Just all in all a really great movie.
0312853238|5.0|Enders game is one where not all people can realy relate to ender.  Most people don't know what it's like to live life expecting to be an outcast for life, and to think every one around you is there to twist you to there  desire.  This was a book that few people can actualy relate to.  I been in  enders shoes more then once, while other can only dream (or fear) whats  it's like to life as ender few have actualy experenced most of what enders  has gone though, like being so tired that your body actualy stops working,  enders time at battle school i have been though more then once.  To see  every one around you trying to change you into something you don't want to  become and then relizing by rebeling against it you only become more of  what they are trying to make you become.
B00003CXDU|4.0|Amusing, a little laugh, a few good actions and good digital effects.
0393317552|2.0|While the premise for Guns, Germs and Steel is interesting and certainly intrigued me enough to buy the book, I found the author pedantic, repetitive and generally uninteresting in his presentation.  I was turned off by Diamond's assumption that his reader was not only naive enough to  think that the current social/economic position held by Whites represents  the pinnacle of modern society (suggesting, in fact, that no one else can  usurp this distinction) but that the only way he could effectively convey  his theory is through the condescending, over-enunciated manner he chose to  use.  <br />     Had this book been written in a previous time period,  Diamond's theory would be useless-- reference the eras dominated by the  Huns, Ottomans and even Illyrians of Alexander the Great.  Further, every  indication of present society leans towards the fact that the changing,  integrating face of the world leaves even more doubt that whites will  remain the supreme race from which Diamond basis his premise. <br />     This  is not to say the book is without merit.  Diamond touches on many areas of  prehistoric history and its relationship to the present, combined with  quite a bit of research, to explain little discussed aspects of how things  became what they are.  In fact, I will never again eat an appealing piece  of fruit without thinking of my predecessors who helped cull the less  desirables from the gene pool.  In this sense the book did, at times, serve  to be quite eye-opening which is why it is still worth the time to  read--however a sense of humor and a huge grain of salt are also necessary  accompaniments.<br />     My main objection to this work, however, remains his  tone which is far too supercilious for the product of thought he actually  produces.  I was turned off by his attempt at being overly academic in his  explanations of his theory while at the same time continuously repeating  what he was going to tell me.  I felt as though I were reading someone'spoorly written thesis about a topic no one was really interested in instead  of a work that won a Pulitzer Prize.  How disappointing.  Don't buy this  book.  If you feel you must read it, save your money and borrow it from the  library.
630575067X|1.0|This movie was an outrage to the Star Wars saga.  How did Mr. Lucas even release this terrible piece of film.   Jar Jar MUST DIE.  He was terrible, I missed half the movie because I could not understand one word that he  said.    Anakin MUST DIE AS WELL.  What a terrible actor!   How could  George Lucas think that he was even acceptable. This torrid excuse for art  is money in Mr. Lucas' pocket, he must be stopped.  I can not believe that  anyone liked this movie!   What is our movie world coming to?  I HATE  THIS MOVIE!

This DVD is also the best test of you DVD player with the best special FX ever and  mind blowing stunts. After watching THE MATRIX you will be wish you could  walk on walls :) just watch it already.
0694007099|4.0|As always, Eric Carle's books are well illustrated.  This book presents illustrations that draw in any young reader to the adventure.  The text is simple and understandable to the young mind.  The story line serves as a  useful tool to discuss issues of &quot;same and different&quot; with your  child.  However, it is not of the same caliber as Carle's other books such  as the Hungry Caterpillar and Brown Bear, Brown Bear...<br />I recommend this  book as part of any child's library, but if your finances are limited,  purchase the other two books mentioned.
B000002B35|5.0|Is it good? What do you think? It's Pink Floyd, it has got to be good.  David Gilmour is unbelievable, guitar solo's kick ass, hooray for the bass player (nice headless thing man), 2 sets of drums: Nick Mason of course and  a really cool setup for the other drummer, he's all over the place, lots of  sweet sax, and the girls (The Great Gig In The Sky is killer). Wow it's a  great show. Check out the video as well.
6304493681|5.0|This is probably the first Japanese anime film that I ever saw that delved into concepts beyond action/adventure tyep situations.  The visualization is hypnotically beautiful.  The only disappointment I had was with the  ending.  The phrase the little girl uses could have been a bit more vague  to add to the mystery that shrounds the movie.
0440219078|4.0|The book is worth reading because it has excitement and mysterious. It can inspire the readers who grew up learning that everything is perfect while it is supposed not to be. The age does not matter only if you have courage to face challenges.
6303014100|4.0|There's really not much I can add to what's been said here. The actors performances all around were outstanding, and the production values first rate. Cudo's to the Producers for the innovative decision to use Civil War  reenactors as extras. One can only imagine the sense of pride, and the  lifetime of memories  these men experienced in reliving this most important  of battles on such a grand scale.     There's been some debate here  regarding which people and parts of the historical battles were left out. I  agree it's a shame that so much couldn't be included. However, I agree with  one person that including the entire three day battle would have given us a  film that was about eight hours long. (Not that I would have considered  this a bad thing of course.)    In any case, if viewers are like me,  they'll naturally assume on their own that a lot was left out, and be  inspired to head down to their local library to find out more. That's  certainly what I did first thing. Also kicking myself for not visiting more  Civil War sites while growing up on the east coast. The possibility alone  of inspiring curiosity should in itself make this movie required viewing in  every High school history class. It's properly dramatic, tells a balanced  view of both sides, and is certainly exciting enough to hold even the most  attention-deprived teenagers interest.<br />   The only real negative I found  here is the serious lack of blood in the film. War is a very bloody  business, and GETTYSBURG seems to be fully in the  `shoot-people-and-they-fall-down' school of moviemaking. The complete  opposite of say, GLORY. I can somewhat understand the reasoning behind  this, since it was partially made to be shown on television, and a lot of  blood and guts would distract from the magnificence of the story and  perhaps even turn off some potential viewers who'd get a lot out of it.  Still, for this lack of realism I have to demote one star from the  rating.<br />  This is another film that badly needs a DVD release. A 2-disk  set with deleted footage, directors/historian commentary track, and a copy  of the `Making of...' special would send this right to the top of my must  have list. Let's hope the folks at Turner productions have this in mind  someday.   Buy this film, preferably in letterboxed format. You will NOT be  dissapointed.
B000000OSO|5.0|This album has the feel of a late-80s rock performance, which may account for some disgruntlement among those who regarded the early 90s as an era for grunge and industrial music and nothing else. I can't say I enjoyed  everything on the disk - that almost never happens anyway - but it's more  than enough for me to give it five stars for the energetic rock and ballads  mixed herein.
6304240554|4.0|Aaaaah, kids these days whose idea of 'horror' is a guy in a funny mask and a machete have got it all wrong. THIS is the real stuff of late night shivers. This low-budget sequel to 'Night of the Living Dead' was a staple  of Midnight Movie showings of the mid-eighties, and anyone who grew up  during that period should know it well. Others here have covered the  details of the plot, so I'll spare you that and simply give a few personal  impressions.<br />  I confess the notion of unending hordes of mindless,  decaying monsters who's only goal is to tear me into tiny pieces and  consume me alive has given me far more nightmares over the years than any  other movie I can think of. One of the features that makes these films so  unsettling is that just as soon as the viewers and film characters have  achieved some sense of safety and security behind thick walls and locked  doors, one small mistake or unavoidable event throws everything into  violent dissaray, collapsing this safe world like a house of cards.       Overall the film is an enjoyable mixture of action, drama, horror, and yes,  a little comedy. The characters come off as sympathetic for the most part.  You admire the resoursefulness and bravery of this small group of people  surviving such a horrific world.  Though at times you can see their  resolve, and even their grasp on sanity begin to crumble around the edges.  A nice touch in my opinion.(Let's see Shwartzenegger show a little remorse  next time HE blows away a room full of badguys in his next film!) The  overall cheap look of the production, much like other effective horror  films like The Blair Witch Project, simply adds to the nightmarish  atmosphere.         The action seemed realistic for the most part. I think  perhaps Romero tried to make up for the small film budget by making the  action onscreen as real as possible. Weapon damage seems realistic for the  most part, (thanks to the always-outstanding talents of Tom Savini) and  guns don't give off the overdone jets of flame that modern filmmakers seem  to prefer nowadays. The decayed zombies are appropriately terrifying,  although some may find the blue-green makeup hastily applied to most of the  extra a bit silly.        Here's a tip for those who love bloopers and have  a VCR with a good Freeze Frame. During the scene where Roger is using his  Semi to run down Zombies, watch for the shot directly following the one  where one leaves a splot of blood on the windshield. There's an external  shot of the body being tossed aside. In the first few frames you can see  the tiny trampoline the stuntman uses just before the truck roars past the  camera!    Overall an enjoyable, but disturbing film, best watched during  daylight hours.
B000002UEB|5.0|Concept albums are tricky, and can easily turn out to be a cheesy smirkfest of inside jokes. Operation Mindcrime, on the other hand, is a brilliant expose of the times - it was conspiracy before conspiracy was  cool (to butcher a metaphor). Engrossing storytelling, definitive  characters, vivid music and plot - this feels like a movie soundtrack or an  opera, and easily could have been. Superb guitar work, biting lyrics,  insightful story ... I recommend this album without reservation.
B000020617|5.0|I love this album - granted it does not have the same feel as the other albums that the Foo Fighters have done, but the feeling is still there. It was actually quite good to hear them doing something different with their  sound. I love the track 'Learn to Fly' and 'Stacked Actors' - though I  heard it was meant to be a personal to Courtney Love. It has power all the  way through it, even in the slower tunes, and they are catchy, getting into  your head when you least expect it. I deffinitly reccommmend it.
B00000K31V|1.0|This movie has one redeeming quality. The concept of the story is quite good.  A completely immersive and engaging VR environment.  That about does it as far as the positive aspects of this movie are concerned.  Utterly  boring with some of the most worthless acting I have ever had the  misfortune of witnessing.  After watching a tremendous performance from  Jude Law in Gattacca, I was praying that his performance would result in an  at least passable rating for this movie.  I was quite wrong.  Steer clear  of this movie.  If you buy it, bury it and then bury the shovel.
B00000K19E|2.0|Yes, the effects were incredible. Yes, the concept was mind-blowing. Yes, Trinity &amp; Keanu look really great in leather &amp; vinyl. But the script - the SCRIPT! and the directing! And the casting! had so much  potential, and fell horribly short. Keanu, I'm sorry, I just don't believe  you as an intelligent computer hacker. You blew that in &quot;Bill &amp;  Ted's Excellent Adventure.&quot; Lawrence, you're a great actor, and with a  slightly better director you wouldn't have sounded so laughably  melodramatic. And whoever wrote the script, you've obviously seen a lot of  X-Files episodes, but you really need to go beyond the  TV-audience-pandering dialogue and avoid the overly melodramatic. It's  could've been a killer movie, but it just fell short, which makes it all  the more disappointing.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This album is wonderful! After listening to clips on the internet for weeks, I finally got the album. It is such a nice mix of all of the talents of the band members. There is something on this album for every fan-whether  their 1st of 5th album is your favorite. The songs are incredible- I have  listened to nothing else for the last week!
0920236162|5.0|This is like the TV show of Fractured fairytales, only better - more contemporary.  Our princess is lucky enough to find out before she gets hitched that the prince probably WOULDN't support her &quot;for better or worse&quot;. Would that more real-life princesses had the guts to realise this before they do the deed.<br />It's not an anti-man polemic, just an affirmative statement that women can be gutsy and THEMSELVES and don;t need to be defined by their appearance being pleasing to the men in their life!
0393312836|5.0|Fiction is always hard to review because it really is up to the opinion of the individual.  BUt I say this book is worth reading simply because of its literal fame.  I don't need to harp on the fact that this was Burgess'  least favorite of his works that just happened to become popular,  especially after the release of the movie.  Read it for your own good, and  judge it as you would any work of fiction.<br />Beware the slang and  terminology, which can deter the unsuspecting reader.  A good story  nonetheless, but I can understand why Burgess cared less for it than his  other works.  There are better Burgess works out there.
B000002JS6|5.0|I'm really not in to explaining my feelings when it comes to this album or any of their album. When I was young back in my days, this was just pure simple loud, rebellious, in your face kind of music. I didn't care about  all the reviews with this &amp; that with who evers. This is what Rock  &amp; Roll is all about...expressioning yourself and being in your face!
0780622553|5.0|The clock strikes midnight, its time for a &quot;tuning&quot;, everybody goes to sleep. White faced aliens replace buildings, landscapes and put Jim in place of John. They replace memories. But what if you can see this,  understand this? Do you really want to know?<br />   What if all your dreams  and fantasies were memories of a different lifetime ? Could you have been  married to your neighbor's wife only yesterday ? Could that first kiss you  had be someone elses ? Do you still want to know?<br />   Many have compared  The Matrix to Dark City, but they are infact the oppositte. In The Matrix  the world around you is a fabrication, in Dark City you are the  fabrication. While I love The Matrix, it is first and foremost and action  thriller. Dark City is a cerebral work , the implications of its ideas are  fascinating, thrilling, sad and frightening.<br />   The film I think that  mostly resembles Dark City would be The Truman Show. A strange notion on  the surface, but it tells a very similar story. An individual is trapped in  a world where he feels he is the only one that's real, where he is  surrounded puppets performing for a higher power. <br />    Dark City was made  in Australia where the costs of building lavish sets is much cheaper then  it is in America. The city looks incredible, the tall buildings loom over  the characters shielding them from the sky, which is always dark. The film  does what the best science fiction should be able to do, it provides us  with an entirely new world.<br />  I saw Dark City for the first time last  week, and I've seen two other times since. At heart it is a very sad film,  if you think about the final images of the film enough, they would make you  cry. The only other science fiction film that challenged me this way was  Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, and even that great film wasn't as  exhilerating as Dark City. And like Twelve Monkeys it never abandons its  ideas midway through to become a simple action film. Perhaps the best  Science Fiction film I've ever seen, but can you handle it?
B00004RFDW|5.0|When I rented this tape from Blockbuster, I didn't expect this picture to be as good as I realized it was after I watched it and thought about it. Many people have criticized the cinematography and pace of this film, but I  found these to be all the m ore intriguing. Many times, the lack of light  adds suspense and in my opinion, added much to this movie. While I don't  think this movie was the best picture of 1999 (American Beauty clearly  deserved this honor), it was the 2nd best. This is the kind of film that,  with most, is either loved or hated. I hadn't been a particular fan of  Michael Mann before, but this totally changed that. Mann's incredible  interest to detail almost makes the film, and Pacino's performance, that  some even consider lackluster, in my opinion nearly outshines others.  Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand probably deserved best actor, but Spacey in  Beauty showed those same qualities as Pacino in this film; Pacino should  have been up for, if not won, best<br />supporting actor. Another  award-caliber performance was Diane Venora's role as Crowe's wife, Liane  Wigand-it was like she was real. This might be the feeling of the entire  film-like it's real. Panoramic views and intense close ups make you feel  like you're in there with Wigand and Bergman. With two of my top 5 choices  in the Academy's as well, I feel this may have been one of those years  where you can actually relate with the Academy's selections; the Insider  totally supports this. Some may find it overly long, some may find it slow,  but those with the intellectual capacity to sit still for twenty minutes  will be pleasantly rewarded with a splendid movie. A strong five stars!
0064471047|5.0|A long time ago, four children found a magical world beyond (what they thought was) an ordinary wardrobe. This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia.      I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than three hours because it was so  interesting and captivating. this is now my favorite book. After I read The  Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I bought the other books in the series.  I recommend that others do too. I enjoyed reading this book and then the  Magician's Nephew.   My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is a lion  that comes to save Narnia from the White Witch. Aslan is very courageous.  My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia.  At the end, Lucy was named Queen Lucy the Valiant.   My least favorite  character is the White Witch. She made Narnia always winter but never  Christmas. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My  second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and  could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better  person in the end.      My favorite part was when Aslan's army were  battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund,  and Lucy were crowned Kings and Queens. Peter was crowned King Peter the  Magnificent. Susan was crowned Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was crowned  King Edmund the Just, and Lucy was crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.  My  least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered  Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and  sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he  lied and said he had never been there.  I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch,  and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I  also recommend the other books in this series.

B00000K19E|5.0|well wasn't I disapointed when I went to the video store last October to find that one of my favorite movies wasn't going to be released on VHS for another 3 months!  I couldn't wait 3 months!  I wanted it now!  So what to  do?  Buy a DVD player of course, and man I can't look back now!  This movie  proved to me how great genre flicks like this can be on DVD.  The sound is  amazing, and the video is great.  There is no way I could watch this movie  in full-frame after seeing all those Kung-Fu sequences in widescreen!  How  could I have ever been stupid enough to think full-frame was better?   And  then I found all the cool extra stuff you could do with this DVD.  Best  money I ever spent!  Completely changed the way I watch movies, it will for  you too!
B000002L9W|5.0|Diamond Dave could not have put together a more perfect band by hiring Steve Vai, Greg B, and Billy Sheehan. Eat Em and Smile was one of the best albums of the 80's. Vai and Sheehan pulling off insane licks and tricks.  This is just a really feel good, party kind of album....
6305627401|3.0|First off I would like to say that I laughed my ass off the first time I saw this movie!  I could tell at times that the directors were just trying to push the limits of what they could get away with in a movie. Watching  how the creators were allowed to get away with this stuff is sometimes as  funny as the movie itself.  There was so much swearing in the movie, I  started swearing like twice as much myself after seeing the movie (it  really desensatizes you to the f word after a while).  I am from Canada as  well, and I really didn't mind the Canadian jokes, but they weren't nearly  as funny as I hoped the would be.  The problem with this DVD is the lack of  special features.  There are so many cool things that could have been done  with this movie, yet all it gives you is a couple of trailers that you  could download anyways if you really wanted to.  This DVD really isn't  worth picking up, maybe you should grab the VHS previously viewed though,  because it is damned funny.  That is of course if you can stand seeing this  sweet animation in 1/2 the resolution =-)
B00000GAIW|5.0|i first heard this album at university in 1983 before vinyl was phased out in 1991, and it is awesome.  i was too young to live through the 1960s but this, to me, evokes the hippie era, hedonism and idealism that young people  espoused.  it's also quite trippy which is cute.
B00003Q438|4.0|I bought this DVD and I hadn't even seen the movie, long story.  Anyways, I was very impressed!  It was not quite like some of the action sci-fi movies that come out today.  The story was actually quite good, and the  characters (at least the main ones) were developed enough that you could  actually care about them.  I also like the positive message that the film  portrays.  The DVD is also excellent, great special features!  Not  anamorphic, but I don't care right now.  If you liked the movie pick it up.   If you didn't see it, pick it up anyways =-)
B00000J7J4|5.0|I had not heard about Carlos Santana till late last year but Iassure you that I was most impressed. I detected a true spiritualityin his playing that is very rare in this generation. His music reminds me of the Carlos Castaneda books that I have read. These tell of the brujos( pronounced brooghos) or near shamens of ancient mexico. It exudes, his music that is, a sheer crude, mature, Mexican ,Latin Spirituality that is at the heights of thier culture. <br />Personally speaking I think Carlos Santana is reprezentin' with this new album. I call him BADBWOY SANTANA, because when I jus' last year saw him play, I was so happy that..  true flow still existed in the world. The band played with a oneness that was truely a sweet smelling savour and to behold was just like witnessing the manifestation of perfection in it's devepment. <br />Put simply Santana is alright, in fact, a man of high status in the musical spiritual realm and I believe you will do a great thing to buy that album Supernatural... and what you have in your hand as you hold that cd, is a priceless commodity in the earth. I know I sounds strange with all this spiritual talk but those who are hearing me are hearing me. I am also going to be selling some books by Carlos Castaneda about his deep, deep....deep experience with a Mexican brujo (shamen) Don Juan, who takes him to different universes and teaches him to be a warrior. If you like Carlos Santana music like I do I know that Carlos Castaneda Books will be a real deep, learning experience for you( you can aquire them from my site below).  Any way enjoy and I hope to see you at my site soon. When you visit Please leave your e-mail address in the request box. So if you feeling my flavour the I am sure we shall meet again. See you soon!
0684833395|5.0|Heller's book is unique.  It's funny.  It's sad and terrible.  His vocabulary is huge.  The man can write.  His story moves.  The characters are insane and know it, at least some of them.  Yossarrin is the real rebel  without a cause.  I really enjoyed this book and wholly recommend it for  those willing to give peace a chance.
6303477259|5.0|I was there in Oakland, CA - I believe it was in 1994.  The video does a beautiful job of capturing the magic of the evening.  This was by far the best musical experience of my life.  I took my daughter, who was 13 at the  time, to see her first big-time live concert.  The look on her face was  worth the price of admission when they started singing &quot;We don't need  no education...&quot;.<br />I have the VHS version of the video, and will be  first in line to buy the DVD.  The best performance of the greatest group  of all time.
6305531412|4.0|I love Roger Rabbit. Most of you have seen it at the movies or on VHS so I wont bore you with those details. Its still the same old movie. It does appear to have been censored from stories I have heard -- where you could  freeze frame at certain points in the video and see clever things inserted  by the animators. The reason for the 4 stars are  a) There are no extra  features at all b) The transfer production is not great. Looks like very  little work was done on this movie to restore the video quality or upgrade  the sound track. Its just VHS quality video and sound. There is no  advantage over the VHS version except it may last a little longer. :-/
B00001OH80|4.0|As far as you can get from 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Heroes', 'Let's Dance' and Bowies' other records. Relaxed mix of reggae and rock'n'roll. Try it!
B00002Z88D|5.0|metallica and the orchestra just seem made to play  together. some of the pieces were absolutely fantastic, the 'hero of the day' stood out as did ktulu. all in all they're a band which keeps pushing the envelope and  coming out tops! a definite &quot;must buy&quot;
6301562925|5.0|Warning-some spoilers ahead.Although the plot and story were slow in some places,I still thought the film rocked.The atmosphere is very dark and creepy and Mike is almost at his scariest here  (especially with the  LeatherFace-type mask.) The gore is beautiful and would probably be at it's  best if it weren't for Halloween 6.Impaled with pitchfork,knifed in  shoulder and harrow to face.Very gross.Gore fans will love this.The acting  and script are above-average,the plot decent and the scare factor is very  very high.The confrontation between Mike,Dr.Loomis and Jamie is quite  intense and the ending has some definite eerieness to it.Don Shanks is  pretty good at playing Myers too.Overall,this is a great entry in the  series and pretty entertaining.No where near as good as Parts 1,2 and 4,but  a respectible and enjoyable follow up nonthenless.Rated R-contains gory  violence,some bad language and brief nudity.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of the greatest films to have come out of Germany in a long time (subjectively speaking of course).  It is a unique film with a unique feel to it, and it is also one of the more daring films of the '90s -  almost at the same level as Fight Club.  The soundtrack is also an  excellent buy.<br />And if this is your initiation to German Film, may I also  suggest these titles: Metropolis, The Nasty Girl, The Marriage of Maria  Braun, and (one of my all time favorite films) The American Friend.
6302516919|5.0|I thought the movie was great!  Stephen King and John Carpenter definitely should make a sequel to the movie, 17 years later. They should entitle it &quot;Christine II, the Revenge&quot;.  I thought the car was beautiful.  Keith Gordon played the part of Arnie very well.  He really looked  possessed.
0375703764|5.0|forget understanding through comparison to dead authors and don't even bother with the post-this and post-thats. i haven't seen or heard the supposed hype, but i like the author's boundary expanding methods and  appreciate the promise of a challenge. i'd recommend this book if you  really enjoy experiments in prose and convoluted plots and enjoy the  sensation of detachment. i'd tell you to avoid it if you are: a) a big fan  of genre fiction b) unable to relate to anything without first      comparing it to at least three other things c) overly concerned with a  book's lasting value to society d) spend large amounts of your free time  writing reviews on web sites, or  e)see title of review
0679777547|5.0|After watching the film &quot;The Ninth Gate,&quot; I began The Club Dumas with the expectation that I would become immersed in the world of rare books. I wasn't disappointed. Perez-Reverte conveys the tactile pleasures  of fragile pages, leather bindings, and the printer's art with the  adoration of an antiquarian. But the author goes beyond the physical nature  of books to explore how a story unfolds within a reader's mind. I was  surprised that the plot, unlike in the movie, revolves around Alexandre  Dumas' body of work rather than a tome on the occult--or does it? We the  readers become as confounded as Corso once we agree to follow him through  what seems to be his scripted fate. As we lose ourselves in the story (any  story), we choose our assumptions about what is happening in the  text.<br />Besides the wonderfully subtle exploration of reader as  audience/actor, I also recommend the book because of the humor and  Perez-Reverte's beautiful language. I wish I could have read this in the  original Spanish!<br />Maybe the literal gloom of the movie is a projection of  the mental confusion we feel when we read a story and try to understand  every aspect of it. Can we stand apart from a book in order to analyze it  when, by involving ourselves in it, we become part of it? This is a great  &quot;Hmmm, I wonder&quot; book.
B000002GB2|5.0|This is the one Styx album I can still listen to from start to finish without skipping any songs.  It perfectly blends the keyboard/guitar sound that so many band were not able to do (including Styx in their later  music). There is no weak song in the lineup.  It also serves as the last  album John Curelewski played on sadly.  Although I like the song,  &quot;Light Up&quot; is an indicator of things to come in the Styx sound.    <br />Dennis DeYoung wrote some great rockers in &quot;Lorelei&quot; &amp;  &quot;Born For Adventure&quot; that he was rarely able to do in later  efforts and JY's &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; is the typical great hard  rocking song we came to expect from him.  It's a shame that since this  album, JY has only been delegated an average of 1 song per album, a crime  in my opinion, with vocals being taken over by Dennis DeYoung (and later  Tommy Shaw).  This comment however does not diminish the fact that this is  a complete album from start to finish.  I highly recommend it to anyone who  likes classic rock!
B000002J1O|5.0|My experience with this album has been twofold - it has been a night-time companion, often driving me to pick up my CD Walkman and go for long and crazy strolls through the empty late night streets of various cities,  because it creates such an extraordinary atmosphere...reading the other  reviews, I can see many people agree. It is such an awesome CD - awesome as  in it instills a sense of awe...and is the only album with which I have  come dangerously close to being obsessed. Which is a good thing...kind  of.<br />But, on the other side, lies an undeniable fact - this is a  progressive rock album, and it is not for everybody. As far as I can tell,  Led Zeppelin et al. fans do not like going here - they are scared off by  &quot;pretentious&quot; lyrics or odd and dissatisfying music. Genesis can  be pretentious and odd, and I think the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is an  example of going too far. So, if you have never tried them, be aware of  that - I am afraid of recommending this to just anyone, because however  excellent it may be, the progressive rock movement is not immediately  accessible. I am not particularly fond of Yes, for example.<br />Selling  England by the Pound never goes too far, however, and I think it is the  best place to start, and is their best album. Away from those who might  dislike it, and my own freaky obsession with the album as a whole, is a  collection of very accomplished pieces played by very good musicians. Peter  Gabriel's singing makes the album distinctive from anything else I have  heard, and Phil Collins' drumming is - for me - one of the most satisfying  aspects. When they kick in thirty seconds apart on the opening song, you  know you are in for something special. And what a finish! Scrambled eggs  indeed. And I don't know of any other band that could have the lyric  &quot;picnic, picnic, picnic, picnic&quot;<br />This was a step in the right  direction from Foxtrot, another very good album, and I cannot enthuse about  my own enjoyment of it enough...njoyment of it enough...
B000002BFZ|5.0|I dont care what anyone says about this album: this is Pearl Jam's masterpiece. This album is really unique and sounds nothing like their other albums. No Code has lots of slow music on it, and there are some  amazing ballads. Songs such as &quot;Off He Goes&quot;,  &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Present Tense&quot;, and &quot;Around the  Bend&quot; really show the slow melodic side of this band. No Code also  features some of Pearl Jam's best rockers (but they are limited) since Ten.  &quot;Hail Hail&quot;, &quot;Habit&quot;, and &quot;Lukin&quot; are the  only rockers on this album, and what great songs they are. This album is  really about the slower more experimental side of Pearl Jam, songs such as  &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; show just how much they were  influenced by Neil Young during the Mirrorball sessions, but those songs  are awesome. &quot;In My Tree&quot; is a U2 type tune, but wow...it sure  sounds great. This album features Eddie at the pinnacle of his lyric  writing and singing, the lyrics have so much meaning to them and the way he  sings on this record is amazing. &quot;Who You Are&quot; has a middle  eastern drum beat thats reminiscent of &quot;Blood&quot; from Vs. That is a  really great song, Ed talks about being yourself and not trying to be  someone else, it has a lot of heart in it. So overall this is Pearl Jam's  best work, nearly every song is good...the only exceptions are &quot;I'm  Open&quot; and &quot;Mankind&quot;, Stone Gossard takes vocals on the  latter mentioning...he should just stick to the guitar playing and let  Eddie keep the vocals on the songs. But besides those two tracks, this is  an amazing record...certainly Pearl Jam's best and I wish they would have  kept this musical style, but they went back to the &quot;Ten&quot; days on  &quot;Yield&quot; which is also a great album, but not as good as this.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I usually listen to punk music (blink-182, rancid, incubus), but could not resist buying this cd. I first heard it on Roswell (my favorite show) and had to find out who sang the beautiful theme song. When I heard it was  Dido, my first response was &quot;Who?&quot;. Of course none of my friends  had ever heard of her, but I decided to take a risk and get it anyway. I  was not disappointed. It is the best cd in my collection. Songs that stand  out are &quot;Here with me&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Thank  You&quot;, &quot;Honestly OK&quot; and &quot;Isobel&quot;. I recommend it  to everyone. It's so beautiful and touching that it crosses all style  boundaries.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I originally borrowed this CD to try and translate the lyrics.  As it turns out, I'm very reluctant to return it - Celine sounds best in French, and that is saying a lot.
B00003Q438|4.0|James Cameron crafted such an incredible movie with THE ABYSS.  The new 2-disc DVD is an incredible release and is sure to please Cameron fans and fans of this film.<br />My favorite is the 60-minute documentary.  When you  see how this film was made, you realize the incredible amount of time and  effort that was spent on it.  I've always read about negative rumblings  from the actors.  This makes sense -- imagine going to work EVERY day for  several months UNDERWATER ! .<br />Complaints about the discs:  I found the  menus hard to navigate!  I got led down several wrong roads trying to get  to the documentary feature.  Also, when watching the &quot;special&quot;  edition, one of the chapter changes (going from an old scene to one of the  &quot;special edition&quot; scenes...) was awful!  The end of the old scene  jittered and got cut off in mid-sentence.  Then the new scene started.  I  don't know if this is a function of my player or the actual disc, but I  found it annoying.<br />The film, itself, is great for about 3/4 of the way.   I don't really like the end.  I find the first hour and 1/2 exciting and  visionary.  The most exciting scene is when the underwater lab gets tugged  to the edge of the abyss by the umbilical cord.<br />All-in-all, the set is  really great, with LOTS of extras.  Just a couple of technical complaints  spoil it.  It's great to see The Abyss where it belongs on DVD!
0312199066|5.0|Eugene Cernan's conversational account of his participation in the Space Program takes the reader on one hell of a ride! His descriptions of blastoff, spacewalks, moonwalks, training, emotional highs and lows places  one right in the middle of the action. I found it to be extremely  entertaining, and not so techno as to bore the average reader. A definite  A+.
0808574914|5.0|It is a fun and interesting book about a grandmamma with a missing thumb and a grandson that gets turned into a mouse by witches.  Witches are everywhere you know.  I could not wait to read this book.  I am in second grade.
B000003TBP|3.0|I wish I could say I loved this album, because I think Beck is so damn cool, but after the first few songs his artistic license make me crazy and paranoid.  I had this album at work and had to take it home, for fear of  damage to my career as a result of Beck-inspired irrational behavior.
B000003TB6|5.0|I recently purchased every last one of the Roots' albums, cause I just want more and more.  Intelligent lyrics and down-home grooves keep my jammin in the car and at home, again and again.  Much thanks to my good  friend Voloe Scott for introducing them to me.
630575067X|1.0|This movie ranks right up there with &quot;Dune&quot; when it comes to really expensive and really bad movies.  It has great special effects, but don't expect much more than that.  The acting was bad and the dialogue was  stupid.  Oddly enough, and despite the state-of-the-art special effects,  the movie has a strongly &quot;dated&quot; feeling--watching it is a bit  like traveling back in time to 1977, as the acting, dialogue, plot  development, and editing seem not to have progressed since then.  And this  is even more of a &quot;guy&quot; movie than the previous Star Wars movies.   Will we ever find out why the Jedi are always male, even when they're not  human?<br />As far as the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks, maybe I wouldn't have  hated the character so much if I'd been able to understand what he was  saying!  Did ANYbody listen to his so-called dialogue before inflicting  this movie on the public?<br />Perhaps the biggest problem is that the  director couldn't decide whether to make a movie for kids or for adults; he  tried to please both, but instead an adult will find much of the movie  really stupid, and a child will find much of it incomprehensible.
071198042X|5.0|This book is excellent.<br />Any real Queen fan will buy and readthis book.

630575067X|4.0|As a Star Wars fan it is my resposibility to point out the high and low points of this film.  First I would like to do a short analysis for some of the major characters.<br />Qui-Gon: His role was one of the things that really  held this film together.  Liam did a great job as this Jedi  Master<br />Obi-Wan:  Ewan did a great job portraying Obi in his apprentice  years.  His character was very believable.<br />Queen Amidala: Natalie did a  fairly good job portraying the young queen.  Few of her lines came off  lame.<br />Anakin Skywalker:  How could you.  I think George could have found  a much better actor to portray somebody so important to the Star Wars story  like that kid from the Sixth Sense Haley Joel.  His lines came across very  lame.<br />Darth Maul:  He was my favorite character of the film because he  was so cool.  Ray Parks martial arts skills are unbelievable.  However, his  character should have been developed much more.<br />Darth Sidious:  Very  mysterious.  Personally I think he is the Emperor himself, only time will  tell.  His character is very sith-like.<br />Senator Palpatine:  As always,  Ian Mcdiarmid does a great job portraying the greedy senator who is soon to  become the Emperor. Jar Jar Binks:  He should not have even been a main  character.  He stole so much of the show and should have had 50% less  screen time.<br />The plot of this movie wasn't all that bad which was the  blockade and boycott of Trade routes to the planet of Naboo.  I feel as  though a lot more will be explained in the upcoming movie which is due for  a May 2002 release.  Some parts of the movie were very predicatable such as  the podrace.  The lightsaber fights were just mind boggling.  Once again I  say that Ray Park was perfectly fit for the role of Darth Maul because he  is capable of doing all the fancy kicking and knows how to fight with a  double-edged sword.  However, the journey back to Tatooine and the  lightsaber fights were nostalgic and brought back a lotof the Star Wars  atmosphere.  The reason why I gave this movie 4 stars is because of Jar Jar  and Anakin.  Everything else fell perfectly into place.  This will probably  remain one of my favorite movies and with the exeption of those two  characters, it is worthy of its position in the Star Wars saga.

B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has found a way to use technology to ease communication. He uses the same tricks (sampling &amp; looping) employed by less accessible electronica masters (Aphex Twin, Seefeel), but the result is anything but  hard to enjoy. There is a lot of samples of gospel &amp; blues in the CD,  especially in &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Find my baby&quot;, &quot;Why does  my earth feel so bad?&quot;, but the palette can get darker  (&quot;Machete&quot;, almost heavy metal), or very light and athmospheric  (&quot;Porcelain&quot;, an apt soundtrack title), up to the near-trance  mantra of &quot;My weakness&quot;. Overall, it's a hard to classify work,  because of the diversity of the songs. It's not techno, really, and it's  not rock proper. It's a contamination, in the guise of Beck's CDs, and it  works just fine. It is easy-listening, but stands up well to close,  repeated listening.<br />If &quot;Everything is wrong&quot; was desperate and  frantic, with some slightly pompous themes (&quot;Hymn&quot;,  &quot;Anthem&quot;), this is instead more resigned and calm. The closing  point of the album, &quot;My weakness&quot;, is maybe the highest. It's  repetitive at first, but its progression is that of a prayer, or rather of  an invocation, and the result is a mysterious, affecting melody that will  stay with you for a long time.
0679720200|3.0|I read the edition of The Stranger as translated by Stuart Gilbert and while I enjoyed it, I completely disagree with the synopsis statement on the back of my edition which reads in part, &quot;A terrifying picture of a man victimized by life itself- he is a faceless man, who has commited a  pointless murder- it is a book whose unrelenting grip upon our  consciousness has not diminished to this day.&quot;<br />I think to say the  protagonist, Meursaeult, is a &quot;victim&quot; of anything is absurd.  I  don't believe he ever saw, or wanted himself seen, as such.  This is  actually a very strong character, very much in tune with himself, what he  thinks, what he likes, those things about which he does not think, etc.   The word &quot;victim&quot; in no way applies and actually, in my  understanding of existentialism, insults the character.  Meursault is also  described in other reviews as one who has been &quot;unwittingly  drawn&quot; into a murder- once again, this suggests a weakness of some  kind - a weakness which our protagonist simply does not have.  He is not  led around by the nose, nor was he &quot;unwittingly drawn&quot; into  anything.  In stark contract to this theory, he did everything very  WILLINGLY and with all his wits about him.  Even when his girlfriend  proposes, he says yes, but only because it does not matter in any way to  him whether they marry or not.  He has considered the issue, found it to be  of no consequence and is willing to do it if she likes.  As for the murder,  the same principal applies...he had possession of the gun, was hot and  bothered by the sun, decided quite consciously to walk forward, knowing  that he would not escape the heat in that direction, nor avert the man up  ahead with the knife &quot;it struck me that all I had to do was turn, walk  away, think no more about it&quot;) but nonetheless proceeded; What then  &quot;unwittingly drew&quot; him to shoot that man- the sun?   No, he  simply decided to shoot him, felt the revolver in his pocket, acknowledged  the oppressive weather and the effect it was having on him and shot. Then  knowing he had just &quot;shattered the balance of the day, the spacious  calm on this beach on which I had been happy, ... FIRED FOUR MORE  SHOTS...&quot;  Bang, End of the victimization theory.  Nor was he  &quot;victimized&quot; by society or the Courts (regardless of how corrupt  either is).  The man simply lived life fundamentally believing that the  world was without purpose, leading only unto death, yet all the more  invigorating because of this fact.  This man loved life on his own terms.   That in contemporary society he'd be considered a sociopath makes no  nevermind to me.  I have not nor do I believe I will ever meet the  realization of these types of characters, i.e. the Howard Roarkes and  Muersaults of the world, nor am I sure I want to.  I do, however, enjoy  reading about them and can see the base validity of their point.
8420483885|3.0|Great expectations I had with this book because I loved &quot;La Piel del Tambor&quot; and &quot;El Maestro de Esgrima&quot;, they weren't fullfiled; I found rather boring and tedious all the parts about the devil and longed for more about Dumas and the musketeers. Maybe is because I have read a lot  about ocultism and I used to enjoy reading the tarot that I wasn't  particullary interested in such a superficial view of it. &quot;The Club  Dumas&quot; is not my favorite Perez Reverte,  but he is always a good read  and in his works you will find enjoyable antiheroes and more than a good  laugh.
0964385619|5.0|This book is the first step to financial UTOPIA.  The first step is to always open your mind to a pattern of thinking that challenges you.  This book does that.  Unfortunately for most families, parents don't teach to  their children what this book teaches..MONEY ISSUES, because most people  can't teach what they do not know.  As a visionary 27 year old entreprenuer  in New York City, this book is an excellent first step to gaining financial  freedom.  This (and How to Win Friends and Influence People) should be  required reading for every school.  This book presents the answers that I  was looking for when taking economic courses in college, but all college  taught was theory, not practical application.
0887308589|5.0|Over the past decade, management books have emerged from academic libraries, and now compete for poll position in the local airport bookstore. Despite this, many are written in unreadable jargon, and tackle the identical banalities, namely the ever-increasing rate of change, the  difference between leadership and management, and people, your greatest  asset. <br />For this reason, it is a pleasant surprise to read that Dilbert  has apparently become the number one business book of all times. <br />Some  people see this as a bad thing.  As management guru Gary Hamel says:  \\"Dilbert is cynical about management. Never has there been so much  cynicism.\\"  Hamel is the strategist's strategist. His book Competing for  the Future is about the ever-increasing rate of change, the difference  between leadership and management, and people, your greatest asset. To the  high priests of strategic thinking, such cynicism is sacrilege.<br />But some  of us enjoy a good laugh, and a well-drawn mental picture has the impact of  a thousand management words. According to Asams we are all idiots, we are  just idiots about different things at different times. Big corporations  encourage idiocy to thrive. Adams is at his best when using humor to show  up these weaknesses.
6305205620|4.0|The first thing I realized when I put the DVD in my DVD-player was that the guys who syncronized this disc must have been either drunk or lazy. I can't count how many times Lars hit the drums and the sound comes a second later. Kirk and James seems to be playing a different song than the one coming out if my speakers... Away from that, this DVD was the best thing  I've ever bought. Jaymz, Kirk, Jazn and Lars really kicks Fort Worths a**!  Lars seems like he has been playing them drums since he was born. And i bet  Kirk sat in Mexico when he was eight an played...solos on his guitar  while he drank tequila. Cause this is the best live-performance I've ever  seen. Nothing beats it. Buy it. Become on of us
B00000I2UE|4.0|They tone down the feedback of their earlier work and reveal the tunes. Of all their Cd's this one is deemed the classic but if I tend to like Stone and Dethroned and Automatic. If you can only buy one, then go for  Automatic, it's their most commerical.
6304698798|5.0|I believe that this is one of the finest achievements in wide-screen filmmaking ever.  Sergio Leone shows his masterfull directing in this Western Epic.  With great performances by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef, this is hands down one of my top 10 favorite movies.  The  juxtapositioning of the camera from a  wide shot to close-up brings energy  to usually static westerns.  A true classic.
B00000J7J7|4.0|I am very impressed with this album.  Mehldau is one of my favorite pianists.  This album made me appreciate him more.  As a piano player he has great technique and skill.  But he uses this technique to create  emotionally powerful music.  It is hard to fall asleep to his music because  it is so interesting.  I you like solo piano, I would recomend this album  to anyone.
0375707972|4.0|I really want to give this 3 1/2 stars. While reading the book I kept waiting for it to get better.. but when I was finished it kept me thinking. The characters seemed shallow- after reading the book I thought that I  couldn't relate to any of them, but I realized the author purposefully kept  them at a distance. The novel gave a unique perspective into how one might  forgive or even love another after they commit unspeakable crimes. I would  recommend it, but don't expect much while reading it.. the impact is how  the book makes you think after you're finished.
B000002LCK|5.0|This early new order compilation compiles the full length 12&quot; singles from 1981 to 1987. The opening track &quot;Ceremony&quot; still sounds very Joy Division-like, tying perfectly into their past with Ian Curtis (Lead  singer of Joy Division that took his life in 1980).  This chronologically  organized compilation shows the impressive string of singles new order  released. The hypnotic &quot;Everything's Gone Green&quot;, the moving  &quot;Thieves like us&quot;, the danceable &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; and the  classics &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; and  &quot;True Faith&quot;.  The 2nd CD doesn't really cut the mustard fully,  they are b-sides after all. There are some great tracks here though.  &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, the opener is the companion track to  &quot;Ceremony&quot;, very haunting. &quot;The Beach&quot; and &quot;Kiss  of Death&quot;, great instrumental remixes of &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and  &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; respectively and &quot;1963&quot;, the b-side of  &quot;True Faith&quot;. All in all a worthwhile compilation. The 2-cassette  version is also worth looking out for; it includes as extra tracks  dub-mixes of &quot;Subculture&quot;, &quot;Shellshock&quot; and  &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;
B00000IPAX|5.0|Although a lot more pop-punk than Chesire Cat, it is still a great album and Blink's best to date by a long shot. All the songs are great, especially Going Away to College, and there is still plenty of Blink's  classic toilet humour. I really don't like people saying that this band are  &quot;sell outs&quot;, which is just a term to describe a band that has  become popular. Blink became popular because their music appealed to a  wider audience than most punk bands and therefore got more air play. Just  because they are popular does not mean that they are no good and that you  can't like them anymore!
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen siempre ha sido de las bandas que mas me han llenado, y que mas puedo pedir? 2 discos con lo mejor del repertorio de Freddy y compaia, una buena seleccion de temas, si solo piensas tener 2 discos de queen en tu coleccion toma estos...no te arrepentiras
B00004RHZU|4.0|I recently purchased &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot;. It's a really great  album, even though I'm not used to that type of music. Pink's style and  creativity definatly shows through her music. I definatly recommend this  album to anyone who likes upbeat R&amp;B music.

6305587159|1.0|Okay; so I'm of two minds about this movie.<br />1). I kind of almost enjoyed it as Star Trek Next Generation movie.<br />I liked that visual nod to &quot;Brazil&quot; with the skin stretching machine. (Come to think of it, an awful lot of the underlying scenery looked like it was recycled from  &quot;Brazil&quot; but nevermind.Imitation is the sincerest form of  flattery.) <br />I also really got into the whole holographic  nothing-is-as-it-seems trip. <br />But the rest of the film was really  baaaaad. The writing was awful. They used every tired Data cliche in the  book. Poor Brent Spiner looked embarassed about 90% of the time. The female  characters really had nothing to do besides sit there and look ... firm.  And then there was the whole Klingon Puberty Trip. Hello!  MUST we be  treated to large, giant Klingon ZITS? Lock and Load? <br />2). I HATED it as a  Babylon 5 wanna-be.(Warning: rant follows. As you know, I get riled.)<br />I  was terribly disturbed by the fact that while Jean-Luc sang Gilbert and  Sullivan, he only made VEILED references to the Holocaust -- The 600!  Get  real. <br />And while I quite nearly almost enjoyed the constant use of the  word &quot;relocation&quot; ( an historical in-joke as the &quot;relocation  center&quot; Manzanar is within spitting distance of Bishop,CA, the  shooting location of this film), I was appalled that Jean-Luc conveniently  &quot;forgot&quot; to elaborate upon historical fact that the Federation  certainly would NOT have forgotten!<br />The writers, while self-righteous and  obviously quite pleased with themselves for referencing both the Holocaust  and American concentration camps, sat on the pot while conveniently  forgetting to POOP! They wanna be Babylon 5 but are afraid to deliver  because it might OFFEND somebody. <br />If one is going to MAKE connections,  one needs to follow through. Let's face it, a lot of Star Trek fans are too  YOUNG to GET the veiled references. It only takes ONE sentence to planta  seed... And one sentence is all I really wanted. <br />I know Babylon 5 was  Different. The writers of B5 blatantly used the lessons of history in the  context of a future science fiction universe --I.E., references to the  House Committee and blacklisting as well as honoring those who were  destroyed by &quot;naming&quot; their NAMES both aurally and on screen. The  characters in B5 KNEW earth history and discussed it. Now, the characters  in STTNG come from the SAME universe. Are they just... shallow?  Is the  Federation educational system ranked on the same level with that of, say,  Arizona? What's up with that?<br />Star Trek Insurrection nearly almost  succeed as Star Trek and failed as B5. Do yourself a favor and buy First  Contact or Generations, instead.
B000002C25|4.0|Despues del exito del disco anterior, todo apuntaba a OASIS, y supieron manejar esto, sacando un disco muy bien producido, con una ejecucion excelsa, un sonido mas crudo que el anterior y lleno de pequeos homenajes  a otras grandes bandas inglesas

6305807086|3.0|This was an okay film. But the critics who raved about it confused it being different with it being brilliant. It WAS imaginitive...but so is your average comic book. But it was still an entertaining movie.
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead es un dueto impresionante, el sonido Trip-Hop es llevado a su maxima expresion, el sonido de portishead es incomparable, la melancolia se casa con la tecnologia y una creatividad desbordante, no hay muchas  palabras para definir un disco en relidad tan bueno, majestuoso viaje a lo  mas profundo de la mente humana
B0000042FP|5.0|With all the fine recorded performances of Verdi's melodramatic masterpiece, this one, after over 4 decades, still remains supreme. The warm, rich spinto-soprano of Tebaldi, the sometimes gruff heroic-tenor of  Del Monaco(for sheer power, equaled only by Corelli &amp; by Melchior  himself-among tenors) but in this performance, at his finest,- &amp; most  splendid of all (to this reviewer) that greatest of baritones(with the sole  exception of Merrill), - Ettore Bastianini in his monumental performance as  Don Carlo di Vargas. The other roles are also filled by legendary singers  at their respective bests (including the great basso, Siepi as Padre  Guardiano).     Altogether, an unforgetable listening experience to enjoy  time and again!
B000002OTL|3.0|Casi nunca me han gustado los &quot;SoundTracks&quot; pero este en particular me cautivo por varias de las razones: *La manera en que estas canciones entraron en la pelicula te ahcen disfrutar la musica mientras  recuerdas la escena *Muchas canciones en realidad son fantasticas *Los  dialogos de la pelicula incluidos * MISERLOU !  (I Love You Honey Bunny)
B00000IQMT|4.0|Episode I. The Phantom Menace. Known as the best soundtrack of the Star Wars trilogy, the Phantom Menace has  gained much fame the past few years as both a movie and a soundtrack. It is known to some as John William's  best score yet, and I wouldn't doubt that! In many ways, this score has a  lot of the same music used in the other three Star Wars movies. The main  title of the Phantom Menace starts the same as the Star Wars main title  before blending into a totally different theme, the Arrival at Naboo.  Almost all of this score is very complex, exciting, and sometimes tense.   This soundtrack has won lots of fame with CD collectors, and it will be  known for years to come as one of William's best. Released on May 4th,  1999, both the movie and the soundtrack were a hit from the start. One of  the CD's main attraction is music such as &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;,  &quot;The Sith Spacecraft&quot;, &quot;Panaka and the Queen's  protectors&quot;, and the end credits. The Phantom Menace is much like the  first three Star Wars movies. If you were pleased with the first Star Wars  movie soundtracks, then you will enjoy this.  Much of this soundtrack is  dominated with brass in a swift rhythm, while others, like &quot;Duel of  the Fates&quot; is a piece sung by the London voices. This is a great  soundtrack, so don't hesitate to add it to your collection!

B000000OEI|5.0|If you like Hanz Zimmer, and you don't have this CD yet, then you are missing a lot! Crimson Tide is in many ways Zimmer's best score, and is probably &quot;The Rock's&quot; eqaul. This score packs tense yet inspiring  music, while other tracks, such as &quot;eternal father strong to  save&quot; are sung with a men's choir. This is a great soundtrack for all  collectors! Don't hesitate to buy!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Alguna ves llegue a decir que jamas existiria una banda tan creativa como pink floyd.... este disco me hace pensar lo anterior mas detenidamente, sin duda este disco es una obra de arte, un paseo por la humanidad robotizada  de comienzos del siglo XXI, desgarrador , perturbador COMO LOS VIEJOS  DISCOS DE PINK FLOYD!  , un disco genial de esos que se dan uno cada 10  aos
0064471837|5.0|When I was 7, my dad wanted to read this book to me, but after 1 chapter I made him stop because I thought it was too scarey. Years later, I decided to give it another shot, and I LOVED it! It's the kind of book that has you on the edge of your seat every single minute and you just don't want to put  it down. I would recommend it for anyone above 13 years old. It might be  too diffucult a read or too frightening for anyone below that age. Also,  there are some references to adult material, another reason for keeping it  away from a younger audience. I found it exciting, suspenseful, humorous in  places, and even occasionally romantic. It's the best book I've read since  The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkein, which I also recommend highly, and  think it's a wonderful read for anyone with imagination!

6305718954|4.0|Stigmata - I expected this one to be a real bore.  After all, nearly every review  I read and every word-of-mouth comment I received told me that it was little more than an extended, direction-less Mtv video-like clip.  You know, lots of flash, a pretty girl outfitted in trends-of-the-moment and a  rehashed exorcist plot.  I outgrew Mtv around the time of my 25th birthday.  So, when I found myself caught up in it almost immediately I was more than  a little surprised.  The story didn't blow me away by any means and it  didn't frighten me.  What it did do was entertain me and that's all I ask  for after a long stressful week.<br /> The non-theatrical ending made so  much more sense (and was much more affecting) than the tacked on happily  ever after Hollywood ending.  I feel for those tortured movie go-ers who  unwisely did not wait for the home release and had this version inflicted  upon them.<br />  4 stars go to the *real* ending, 2 stars for the lame  Hollywood version.
B000001BX0|2.0|Un Disco para mi gusto sobrevalorado, en realidad, es tan bueno? este disco es para los que caen con el apantallamiento facil y se cren la actitud que toma la banda en sus letras, en realidad tengo que decirlo  algunos temas son muy buenos, pero hay otros que jamas deberian haber sido   grabados, la &quot;chavada&quot; cae redondita con las letras de la banda,  epro, son tan buenas? el decir una bola de sandeces es gran musica? no es  por ser regazon, pero es algo que las banadas anglosajonas llevan haciendo  por aos, bueno, tal ves ese sea el punto: este disco revoluciono la  mijigata radio latina (en especial la mexicana) con sis letras, pero si  buscas uno de los mejores discos del movimiento  latino, estas viendo en la  direccion incorrecta
0060977493|5.0|The God of Small Things, Roy's first book is full of new ideas and a writing style I have never yet encountered. She draws you on in her amazingly descriptive writing style and interesting use of sentences. The story itself is filled with humour, compassion, bitter cruelty, and shock,  and makes certain that it reaches into your soul and rips out your  emotions. The facts are not clear initially, as Roy jumps throughout time,  back and forth; yet near the closing chapters all the facts fall into place  and we become aware of the writer's brilliant craftsmenship at connecting  time periods and details. The well-rounded characters develop through the  harrowing circumstances in which they are involved, and it is obvious that  Roy understands and includes the true natures of people, both good AND evil  and one often has to step back from the book and marvel at how she cuts  through all the layers of pretence and reveals what many people really are.  Issues include Communism, a detailed and genuine potryal of India and the  Caste system-and how it affects the characters of the book. I recommend  this book for anyone seeking to read a book of true genius and genuine  understanding of what it is to live in a world of prejudice and assumption.
0790734311|5.0|In brief, when I watched this film I felt as if I were really watching events of the last century taking place before me: the characters were all real to the bone, the storyline intriguing, and the action gripping.  I couldn't help but contrast this production with older westerns made up  through the 60's or so, where heroes wore white (spotless) ten-gallon hats,  with black shiny boots and silver medallions all over their clothing and  tack.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes westerns.
B00003CXDU|5.0|This film has just come out here in the UK and I went to see it at the cinema.  Pure class.  It is so funny, and all the mickey takes on star trek are incredible.  Best bit of the movie (or should that be bits, lots of em) is when an alien explodes, but I'll leave that for you to see more.
630575067X|5.0|Absolutely awsome! Stars Wars Episode 1 is the best of the series!  The special affects are two thumbs up and the music is great!  I would highly recomend this movie to anyone.  It is an action packed funny movie that  will last forever!  May the Force be with you.
0780625633|5.0|This movie will leave you thinking, it will leave you stunned, and if you are a Neo-Nazi it will make you think twice about being in that crowd, This was without a doubt the best film of 1998. I highly recommend this  masterpiece.
630179849X|1.0|This one starts off great w/ a train robbery but then flickers out light a used candle.  The Duke was paired with co-stars who seemed to know nothing about the dialect or mannerisms of the old west.  Their acting styles made  them great candidates for guest spots on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; or  &quot;Charlies Angels&quot;. The two girls were quite the hotties but out  of place in this flix.  Im wondering who the target audience was.  All in  all, worth seeing once for the train robbery but don't even think of buying  this one.
0767849493|5.0|A must see for all over 15.  This is one of the most innovative movies I have ever seen.  The movie progresses at a rate which all will enjoy.  The way characters are introduced by falling out of the sky is hilarious.  The  dialog is a bit crude, but that only makes it that much better.  All star  cast, all star movie.  Kevin Smith has to be one of the best  writer/director/actor/etc. in a long time.
B0000024YL|4.0|I must agree with all the previous comments about the production and mastering of this album. Three classic tunes are ruined by applause crossfades. I do think the live versions, unique to this album, are very  nice, although at times I still doubt they were really 'live' because the  applause fades to near studio separation silence as the verses begin. And  while I am on the subject of the annoying loud applause, why did the  engineers throw the applause levels up and down so quickly at the start and  close of those songs? It sounds ridiculous! Very unnatural and unnerving. A  new Simon &amp; Garfunkel best of collection seems to have replaced this  compilation. Stick with that if you haven't already bought this  meant-for-lp set.
B000005HF9|5.0|For more than 20 years I have listened and re-listened to this album. As much as I might appreciate some of his later directions (I love the quartet with Hancock, Shorter, Carter, &amp; Williams), I believe that, for  feel-good jazz and sophisticated arrangements, Miles never again reached  the pinnacle that he reached when he led this band in his early 20's.   <br />Konitz is his usual fluid, cool self.  Mulligan is great. John Lewis -  the Basie of Bop. Miles fumbles a little (I always felt there was a  sloppiness to his playing). <br />After 50+ it's still influencing musicians.   Can anything more be said? <br />I'd also recommend Mulligan's re-recording,  from 1992, The Re-Birth of the Cool
B000002H2H|5.0|While this album is not as fast or energetic as 'Kill 'Em All', it is much more serious. The only song they really let loose on is &quot;Fight Fire With Fire.&quot; However, the songs are generally better. &quot;Fade to  Black&quot; is one of the most emotional pieces I've heard, and &quot;For  Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; just plain rocks, with an awesome groove. I don't  really care for the title track or &quot;Escape&quot;, but every other song  is a winner, especially &quot;Creeping Death.&quot; Buy this if you like  Metallica, it embodies what the real Metallica is about.
0805062971|5.0|Ride?  Yes, ride.  This novel takes you on a journey - and you will emerge transformed - with a new respect for the written word.  Generation X has found its spokesperson, and he is Chuck Palahniuk.
B000002H33|5.0|And I would have to agree. The guitar sound on this album is maliciously intense. That acoustic guitar intro to &quot;Battery&quot; had me fooled, and the sudden burst of speed caught me by suprise. &quot;Master of  Puppets&quot; is one of the best metal songs ever. &quot;The Thing that  Should not Be&quot; is incredibly heavy, but I don't really like it. Every  other song is great, especially &quot;Welcome Home(Sanitarium)&quot; and  &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; &quot;Orion&quot; is a beautiful, very emotional  instrumental. This album mainly focuses on the misuse of power, especially  on &quot;Leper Messiah.&quot; This is the band's last album with bassist-  extraordinaire Cliff Burton, who was killed in a bus wreck. May he rest in  peace. Buy this album, it is one of metal's greatest achievements.
1573225517|4.0|Hornby presents the reader with a protagonist so flawed, so aggravating, and so completely human that it's impossible to feel anything but empathy for him, despite recurring wishes to reach into the pages and knock some  sense into him.  This is a novel chock full of wit, heartbreak, humor, and  agonizingly familiar situations.  A delightful read.
B00000BKE1|3.0|Ok, the production is somewhat patchy, and a few of the songs should have been b-sides, but after No Prayer, this was a godsend.  With new lyrical direction, as evidenced in songs like Wasting Love and Afraid to Shoot  Strangers, and classics like Fear of the Dark, it's still light years ahead  of what most other bands only dream of producing.  I don't think Fear is  the Key or the Fugitive should have been on there, and again, the  production could have used some work, but it's still not as bad an album as  many say.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|This vastly under-rated (and misunderstood) film is one of the best films of the 90's.  From the stylish, gritty, flashy direction of David Fincher (Se7en, The Game), to the career-high performances of Oscar nominees Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, to the devilishly conceived story  (very faithfully adapted from the brilliant Chuck Palahniuk novel), this is  a film that should be in absolutely everyone's collection.<br />The most often  misunderstood facet of this film is its intention.  Fight Club does not  glorify violence.  It is not an over-sensationalized piece of propaganda.   It is a scathing, intricately woven social satire.<br />And for DVD collectors  out there - this one is going to be HOT!  The DVD edition has absolutely  everything you're looking for - and even without the added features, this  is a film whose high level of visual and audio accomplishment deserves to  be viewed on DVD.  And the score (composed by the Dust Brothers) is one of  the most unique and effective you will ever hear.<br />A Masterpiece.
0345350499|4.0|I was really worried when I picked this book for an english assignment for school. Its 2 inch width almost scared me off! But luckily, I was hooked after the second chapter and couldn't put it down! It was an incredible  story about perseverence and the strength of a woman. I loved this book! I  would recommend it to anyone who has the time to read it.
0684833395|5.0|I read this book and loved it! It is by far one of my personal favorites. It has been critized as slow to start, which is partly true, but once you get used to Heller's style it is one of the greatest stories ever written.
0446310786|4.0|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; by Harper Lee, is a story of two kids growing up in a southern town. They have to face racism and prejudice when their father is appointed to defend a black man who is accused a raping a white girl. Every one in the town shows up for the trial in order to see  the outcome. The two kids cannot fathom just how cruel and unfair people  can be.<br /> The setting is very important element to support theme in  the book. It is set in a small southern town that has hidden racism  problems. The children become educated about the ways of the south and how  to deal with racism and intolerence that affects themselves and their  father. By setting the book in the south, the prejudice problems are more  apparent. Education is a major theme that is brought out when people do  things out of ignorance. Some of the white townspeople are largely ignorant  and do not care about innocence or guilt, only skin color.
0767803434|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have seen.  I love Harrison Ford movies, but this one is a stinker.  The special effects look like they are from the 50's.  I just watched Top Gun and Star Wars.  Both of them had better arial shots.  The plot was a die hard rip off.  Talk about suspending disbelief.   This is about as phoney and contrived as they come.  I like far fetched  movies like the Matrix, but this is just plane (ha ha) silly.  The  fundamentals are all wrong.  No character development.  Why didn't they go  ahead and make the president a former wrestler who happens to be a ninja  war hero?  I haven't been this disapointed in a movie since CONGO.
1582880050|4.0|I opened this book expecting litle more than a fleshed-out porno movie, since it was, after all, the subject of one many years ago and was well thumbed in my high school library, but only at the sexy parts. What a  surprise for me to discover a harsh critique of British class structure,  the industrial revolution, artists and intellectuals, and self-gratifying  sex.<br />Yes, there are explicit sex scenes. Yes, he uses some language that  must have been extremely shocking in its time. But my, oh my--if everybody  on this planet made love the way Mellors and Constance Chatterly did, with  awareness, and tenderness, and absolute vulnerability--well then, I won't  go so far as to say we would have world peace, but I bet we'd be a heck of  a lot happier.<br />This book is not a great piece of literature. It offers a  grim picture of an earlier England by somebody obviously disenchanted with  it, a great harpooning of Robin Hood forests, the upper crust, and literary  snobs. It's a bit ponderous here and there, and the seasonal metaphors are  a bit sophomoric. Still, it was the Lawrence's final book, and embodies a  lifetime of thinking about sex, the body, and the spirit. Worth the read!
B00000DF6O|4.0|This is a marvelously encouraging album; B.B. clearly demonstrates no desire to rest on past accomplishments and goes back to his roots for some real blues. No guests, no slick pop numbers, no coasting. It's great when  someone has nothing to prove, then proves his worth anyway. That said, this  is not his best (just trying to put the reins on some of those  over-enthusiastic five-star reviews!). His guitar playing and singing  certainly are not that of his prime. Let's have some perspective here.  Still and all, a very fine album you should make a part of your collection.
0446310786|4.0|Last night I could not put the book down for anything--the end was sooooo good!  The reason that I rated a book that blew me away a four was that the beggining was kind of slow.  It wasn't boring, but it did take Harper Lee a while to get to the point of the story.  It is a phenomenal book that  anyone, and everyone, should read, don't let the slow beggining turn you  away.  It all comes together in the end.  I thought that the way the  relationships between the characters was explored was excellent.  I really  felt like I knew them, especially Atticus, and Scout, the protaganist.   This shows racism and prejudice in its simplest, most hateful and truest  form, and the way it turns nieghbors and friends so strongly against each  other.
6305090564|5.0|When I watch a monster/horror movies I want to be scared. This movie does just that. It's not the most original story but it is great fun to watch. It builds the tension from the very first and gets scarier and more gory as  the story progresses. You really have no idea what the monster really is  until the classic scene where the hero confronts it. The special effects  are excellent(expected) and original(rare). The movie is visually beautiful  and the soundtrack is very good. I would like to have seen more development  of the love interest between the two characters but that is not the reason  you see a movie like this. Shakespere in Love this is not. This is a very  fun movie with no redeeming value and there is nothing wrong with that.
B00003CWL5|5.0|Wow, wow, wow.  This is truly remarkable.  I still don't know if this is a movie or a scene from somebody else's actual life.  The performances are flawless - especially from Kevin Spacey, who deservingly received his 2nd academy award - his indifference to all the twisted stuff that happens  around him is magnificent; I'd swear to God that's me in 30 years time.   What makes this piece so interesting though is the myriad of characters  that could be described as 'quirky', they're so much fun to watch.  You  have the average Joe (Spacey), the wife nobody would want (Annette Bening),  the teenage blonde (Mena Suvari) etc.  Everybody is so weird that it's safe  to say that the gay neighbours are the most normal characters in the whole  movie.  This, along with Magnolia, made 1999 a fantastic year for ensemble  pieces.  Both were wonderful movies, but this one is better in that it  doesn't get weighed down by its ambition, and was mesmerizing in that the  direction, the performances, and the screenplay really geled together.   Everybody who was involved deserves to give themselves a pat on the back.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Finally, one of the most classic horror movies will be released on DVD!  I have been waiting for this ever since I bought my DVD player.  And from the sounds of the special features, this is going to be one of the best DVDs that Universal has ever released.  Now if they could just release all the  other Spielberg films on DVD I would have the set of my dreams.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Carlos Santana has achieved that rare feat, having his cake and eating it, too.  He has managed to update his sound to appeal to a younger generation of listeners, while still staying true enough to his roots not to alienate  his loyal fan base.  While the &quot;modern&quot; production values of the  album may not be my cup of tea, there are enough guest stars and fiery  playing by Carlos to keep things musically interesting.  <br />Anyway, I happy  to see that a veteran musician from the 60s can still top the charts while  remaining true to his roots.  I tip my hat to you, Santana!
6305609721|5.0|This Star Trek movie was not impressive to me when I watched it on video.  The other day I spotted the DVD on the shelf and decided to try it out.  It turned out to be one of the best DVDs that I own.  The features are  fantastic and the widescreen animorphic that is missing from Star Treks 5  and 6 is finnaly present with this film making it all the more enjoyable to  watch.

0446525537|5.0|This is Spark's best of the three he's written. It's an easy read, I finished it in one sitting partially because it's easy reading and partially because I couldn't put it down. A Walk to Remember is heart warming and sensitive. The story is one in which  everyone can relate to.
0451196716|5.0|That's unmistakably Bachman! Who else could have written a story where characters are shot one after one, one after another, sometimes in pairs, in triangles, but mostly on their own. With all others watching. Waiting  for the finger of fate touch them and pass the leprosy of death. Grim  novel, but somehow beautiful in its own right. Like 'The Regulators',  written 26 years later, here we have no winners. The two novels are  sisters, in fact. In the latter the main fetish is television, in the one I  am reviewing, it is sports - with live performance and spectators. It  reminds me of the old movie with James Caan, 'The Roller Coaster'.  Participants are wolves to each other, and although at the beginning they  have their sanity working, not long after they lose all humanity and real  ground, transforming into animals who operate on instinct. The  self-preservation one. There is one thing we share as a society, which King  emphasizes as symptomatic and ever-present. The circus. Remember ancient  Rome and gladiators? Rome's people needed circus and bread, and since then  the human race has not changed much. I could perfectly imagine myself as a  spectator of The Long Walk. I do not deny that there is a blood-thirsty  animal inside my own self. And I am not alone, I guess, which makes this  novel more real than one might think initially. A final word about the  writing style. Abstracting from the subject of  fiction here, we can  clearly see that already as an undergraduate, Stephen King was perfectly  able to get a good grip on our throat, to make us read madly, to interrupt  the main  story with leisurely paced amazing digressions, to put life into  his characters - make them 3-dimensional and ripe, to transplant his  memories of fatherland into fascinating environment, and finally, just to  write a helluva lot of a good story.
0783244320|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved Galaxy Quest.  It's one of the first movies that I own on VHS and DVD both (the only other two being 'The Last Starfighter' and 'The Iron Giant').  However, the DVD, while actually very  well done, just seems to be missing something.  The missing scenes included  in the film are fine, but there were scenes in the film's original previews  that are oddly missing, and a lack of a director's track on this DVD is  something I find detracts from the overall quality.  It feels like somebody  spent a lot of effort, but forgot a few key things.Is it worth your money?   Oh, absolutely!  It has all the things that made the film so watchable and  entertaining, and the 'Thermian Language' Dolby track is inspired (though  it does get old quickly.)  Some of the animations and linking sequences in  the DVD menu are quite entertaining and clever, but I find myself wishing  there was a 'Collector's Edition' of this film for nutso completionist fans  like myself.Until then, though, this DVD will do just fine.Questarians  unite!  The 'Quest' continues!- T
0451197968|5.0|The future is not what it used to be, as the old saying goes. How should we look at a futuristic novel 29 years after it was written? I call the book futuristic, as it does not earn the name of science fiction. What immediately struck me is the similarity of this book and the recent  blockbuster, The Matrix. There are differences, obviously, but they are not  crucial. There is the Matrix, and there is the Network. In both  environments, people in their whole mass live either terrorized, or  corrupted, but almost everyone is living in a sort of a bad dream. The  Bachman's world of 2025 is not a pleasure to live in. Inhuman institutions  which took the earth over - that has been the dread of XX century, now  coming slowly to its end. Many authors fantasized about it in a great many  of ways and it does not really matter whether the novel is framed as  realistic, naturalistic, pure science fiction, or just futuristic, as in  the case of The Running Man. We may sketch yet another comparisons. This  book and The Long Walk sport the same theme of a wild national pastime,  where human life is sacrificed to entertain the bloodthirsty masses, and by  no means the boogeymen - all the ordinary people, all of us, or, rather,  all of them. Circus and bread, that's all the society need, sad but true,  at least since the Roman Republic. Similarities may be pointed out between  the book and the last to date Bachman novel, The Regulators, in the sense  of the power the media have over us. The danger of detachment from reality.  In The Running Man, the evil is personalized in the Free-Vee, an Orwellian,  omnipotent super-television. Coming back to what I mentioned at the very  beginning, the future-world Ben Richards lives in is a little funny from  the point of view of a guy who lives in a cyber era of the Y2K. Technology  is faster-paced than the best industrial prophets can estimate. A funny  thing is that Ben's aircraft is Lockheed. Well, the firm went bankrupt  several years after the publication of the novel. One can list such  oddities, but why the hell? Does the fact that 2001 the Space Odyssey was  directed in the 60s DETER all the entertainment? No, it doesn't. Same goes  here. To me, it's a sort of fun to read old futuristic prose and compare to  the reality. One might wonder why King wrote such a novel, so much unlike  the other ones. First of all, it only proves his ability and breadth of his  capacity as a writer. On the other hand, what we look in his prose is not  so much the scene, the environment, as the characters themselves,  narration, dialogues, and IT, something unique and King-ian (or King's  King-ese? King-ous?). All in all, I liked the book very much, was  entertained throughout, was brave enough to disagree with the author that  Schwarzenegger is not a good type of guy to portray Ben Richards, and of  course I was sad with the way it ended. Before I finish, I have to  complain, though. I have just bought a Signet paperback sporting FOREWORD  by Stephen King. What is the purpose of foreword? We all know, I suppose.  Nevertheless, as I worked my way through it, I had to grimace when King  revealed the ending of the book in his preface. Oh, Master, why have you  done it? You, who often complained that readers have itchy hands and peek  at the last pages because they can't hold to the end? You, who published  The Green Mile as a serial novel and publicly admitted that you liked the  idea that readers couldn't just open the last page and see the end? I am  angry with you, Mr. King. But just a little. Inside, I am glad as hell that  I had an opportunity to read this outstanding novel. Thanks. And I ask for  more.

I was amazed that while the cliches were there, they were all presented in a way that was either so fresh or so funny that I just loved reading about  Bridget's crazy (like all of ours) life and equally crazy (like all of  ours) love-life.  I'd recommend this book to anyone.  (Or at least anyone  with a sense of humor!)  It is just brilliant!
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is sort of the exact opposite of Pretty Hate Machine... While PHM was lighter, this is loud and hard. It doesn't sell out or go soft, it's Tremt Reznor at his angriest... Check out &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Last&quot; (one of my favorite NIN songs to date), and  &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;. While there's only eight tracks on here,  and two of them are instrumentals, there's really not a bad song on this  disc. You'll like it if you like the second CD of The Fragile. Definately  buy this one. Also check out &quot;Fixed&quot;, which has remixes of these  songs.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I have owned this cd for many years and I can't count the number of times I have played it just to relive the &quot;goosebumps&quot; it gives me every time.  This really is Morricone's masterpiece and it elevates the  movie in my mind, which is what a soundtrack should do.  The theme is  replayed several times on the disc by different instruments and choral  groups.  It all captures the images on screen very accurately.  I would say  this is one of my favorite movie soundtracks of all time.  Check it out, or  at least watch the movie and see what you think.
6305076650|4.0|So you haven't seen this movie and you call yourself a true movie fan!  BAH!  I'm sorry, folks. Whether you like it or not, this one's required-reading. And I will tell you something now: I've seen worse on USA's UP ALL NIGHT. In fact, that's just what this movie makes fun of. It  takes all those late-night science-fiction thrill-omedies and skewers them  mercilessly. A favorite of mine since first-viewing, it's a great musical  and an outrageously fun romp. Misunderstood greatly when it first came out,  this satire preys on cheesy musicals(&quot;Dammit, Janet&quot; is a  wondeful indication of this), sex-and-science-fiction films(read  &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; &amp; &quot;Barbarella&quot;) and a bit of  society's judgement of man(&quot;Frank-n-furter!/It's all over/your mission  is a failure/your lifestyle's too extreme&quot;) and how we're crucified if  we're not perfect. The performances are on par(including early ones from  Barry Botswick and Susan Surandon) but it's truly Tim Curry who steals the  show(as the transsexual Vampire known as &quot;Dr. Frank-n-Furter&quot;) in  a role STILL arguably unequaled to this day.<br />Wonderfully kinky, catchy  and definitely DIFFERENT, it's not a film for everyone but then again,  wasn't that the aim to begin with?<br />--Matt
6305451591|5.0|A comedy set during the holocaust?  I couldn't believe the audacity of the concept.  I dragged my wife down to the local artsy theater to watch the subtitled version--and we both loved it!  The romantic, almost slapstick comedy that opened the film made us fall in love with these characters even  before we began to fear for their lives.  The poignancy of the father's  ability to protect his son from the horrors of the prison camp was  powerful.  His scene of interpreting the German guard's speech almost had  me laughing on the floor, and the myopic insensitivity of the riddle-loving  doctor had me seething.  But only in a second viewing was I able to release  the full gamut of emotions this movie called for.  Each time I see the  movie it's like looking deeper into a lake, detecting richer hues and waves  of feeling.  As stated during the opening scenes, this film is like a  fable.  If you can appreciate the childlike &quot;simplicity&quot; on the  surface, you'll be washed away by the currents of truth that course through  every scene.

0780622553|5.0|Few directors have succeeded since 1896 in presenting their imaginary world into a movie. At this moment, I can only think of Federico Fellini, Luis Bunuel or german director Werner Herzog. Hollywood directors have been for too long under the strict control of their producers and couldn't let  their imagination control their camera. So, only the fantastic and the  science-fiction genre since the seventies let directors like David Lynch  create a fantasy world with the OK of the Hollywood moghuls.<br />DARK CITY is  a masterpiece, a unique world invented by director Alex Proyas and he  succeeds where Luc Besson, with THE FIFTH ELEMENT, failed. This world is  not just a sumptuous decor justifying extra-terrestrial battle scenes and  expensive special effects ; this world is alive, the characters do have a  psychology, in short, we feel that someone has worked on a screenplay in  order to show us a movie destined for a more than 15 years old mental age  public.<br />DARK CITY is a movie sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick would have  adored. In fact, you can recognize one of the themes of TOTAL RECALL in the  way the Others steal and manipulate the memories of the humans they  control. The pessimistic aspect of this movie is also a constant we can  trace in Dick's books.<br />At last, DARK CITY is full of visual ideas only a  genuine movie director can have and reproduce on pellicle. So let's wait  with great impatience for Alex Proyas's next movies.<br />A DVD for your  library.
0393317552|1.0|The winner of a Pulitzer Prize usually recommends a book all by itself. Sadly however, this is not the case with Guns, Germs, and Steel. Making no effort to lure the casual or lay reader to the history and anthropology within, this scholarly work is inaccessible to anyone not already  intimately interested in the subject matter. Where it is not inaccessible,  it suffers an even worse fate, it is uninterestingly told.<br />The author  compounds these problems by restating his points once they have been firmly  made. For example, he builds the case that the domestication of large  animals was responsible to a large degree for the propagation of disease  (the \\"germs\\" of the title). He then makes a connection to the devastating  effect these diseases had on unsuspecting Native Americans, who by the way,  had not domesticated animals, and therefore had not developed any diseases  of their own. Okay so far, but he retells these causal points every way  imaginable, and misses no opportunity to do so. None of what he refers to  as proximate or ultimate causes is exempt; plant propagation, population  density, political organization, continental axis orientation, writing,  language, and technology escape all suffer this fate.<br />With books like  this it is no wonder we are losing interest in science.
6304698798|4.0|What a difference between FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY in Sergio Leone's career. It's the difference between the movie of an average director who has some good ideas to renew an old dying genre, the Western, and the movie of an authentic author-director able to present  a 3 hours long story without annoying his audience.<br />You will find in THE  GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY the germs of Leone's three last movies and,  already, some references to his precedents films like Ennio Morricone's  musical score during the final duel, about ten seconds of the clock music  heard in A FEW DOLLARS MORE.<br />The opening sequence of THE GOOD, THE BAD  AND THE UGLY is terrific : a man is waiting for what it seems to be his  duel adversaries and the music, the cinematography make us believe that we  will admire a pure Sergio Leone's duel when the director finally decides to  change his mind and to refuse us the duel we have waited for. That is pure  cinema, a pleasure no other art is able to give us.<br />One of the aspect  announcing ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is the use of Ennio Morricone's  music. More lyrical, the notes follow the director's long travellings and  give another dimension to certain scenes. When image and sound meet and  match perfectly, it's one of the sign of a great movie.<br />THE GOOD, THE BAD  AND THE UGLY is not perfect but it is always a pleasure to watch this movie  full of scenes of anthology.<br />A DVD not to be forgotten.

B00000K2SC|3.0|The Matrix...ahh, the Matrix is to cyberpunk what Mortal Kombat was to the martial arts genre-pablum. Yes, it did have completely awesome special effects, but as we have seen time and again, special effects do not a good movie make. Unfortunately, this appears to be all that is good about this  film that makes William Gibson's `Neuromancer' look the finest of  Shakespear's sonnets. It entertains, sure, but then again, so do a lot of  N-64 games, as long as you don't think about it too hard. Keanu Reeves does  not deserve to appear in the same scenes with the likes of Lawrence  Fishburne-who single handedly steals every one they share together.<br />  Okay, Mark, you've complained a whole lot so far, but haven't said what the  Matrix is actually about. Okay, the Matrix is about this guy named Neo  (Reeves) who has a McJob that he hates, but when he goes home at the end of  the day, he becomes a cyber-guy and logs into America On-Line or something  where he can abandon his life of quiet desperation. He also notices that  the world sometimes isn't what it looks like, (and what it looks like is  Quake, because everything is olive green and grey). He meets Trinity  (Carrie-Anne Moss), who basically looks like she's undead in leather, and  she wants to show him a whole new world, but first must get Neo past the  sinister Agents, the leader of which played Tick in `Priscilla-Queen of the  Desert'.<br /> After `escaping' Neo wakes up in a black pod covered in  strawberry jam with dozens of tubes feeding into his body out of something  that resembles H.R. Geigar Lite. He also finds that there are millions upon  millions of McPods just like his. Now we meet Morpheus (Fishburne), who  out-cools Reeves at every turn, and we learn that there is a band of rebels  who have escaped the Matrix-a massive immersive virtual reality system that  all of humanity has been trapped in by evil robots that we created, (Geez,  you'd think we would have learned not to do things like that afterthe  Terminator thing). Now it gets dumb (er, dumber).<br /> The Robots and the  artificial intelligence that runs the planet are harvesting humans for heat  so that they may continue...doing what, we're never told, but keeping  humanity under wraps seems to be all they do. Now, Morpheus is convinced that Neo  is the Chosen One, a cyber-messiah who has come to save all of the  oblivious humans trapped in the Matrix. Forgetting of course that, if they  win, they have to clothe, house and feed billions of humans who might be  better off inside their pods. Morpheus trains Neo how to fight, thanks to a  healthy dose of plug-in skill chips that instantly teach martial arts and  weapons skills to anyone. The worst part about the  film is the betrayal. In much the same way as the Secret Service agent who  sold out the President in `Airforce One' made no sense, the betrayal in the  Matrix leaves the viewer going `Huh!  Where did that come from! \\" Because  in order to enter the Matrix, one must be supervised and plugged in-things  that can't be done on one's own. He will sell out Morpheus so that he may be  plugged back into the Matrix-all because he's tired of living on the crummy  submarine and eating reonstituted slop.<br /> The Matrix is slick, and it  does have its moments, but the story leaves a great deal to be desired. I  would like to say the action is fast paced, but it isn't because every  action scene is shot in slow motion-from NRA gun nut romp through the lobby  of an office tower where the Agents are hold Morpheus to the end sequences  within the subway, the break neck action scenes seem to last forever, and  it gets tedious. It is cookie-cutter entertainment in much the same way  that `Independence Day' was-it's great as long as you don't think about it  too hard. Of the three blockbuster movies of 1999-The Phantom Menace, The  Matrix, and The Mummy, The Mummy is the best pick of the bunch. If you want  to discover good cyberpunk, read Neuromancer or Islandsin the Net.
B000023X9W|4.0|There are few musicians who've been around since the peak years of Rock and are still making excellent music. Bowie, Springsteen, and Young all prove their brilliance while the Phil Collins's and Elton John's of the  world sell out. Here is Neil's best album since Mirrorball and his most  personal since Harvest Moon. This album, oddly, reminds me in many ways of  Ghost of Tom Joad, Springsteens own languid journey into his heart. I love  it.
630508999X|5.0|This movie was in my opinion, much better than the first. It's more suspenseful, shocking, and just overall better-written. You'll never guess the killers! I think it has more edge and suspense, very exciting. Get this  movie, you'll love it!
0790735172|2.0|I didn't say that I dislike Bruce Lee, but I found that this movie lacks his charisma and aura. When I first watch this video I expect a lot of action, but the most exciting fight scenes only come 50 minutes later.  Before that we just see Bruce walking, smiling, have a flashback and the  introduction of other unneeded heroes.<br />Having two other characters (John  Saxon and Jim Kelly) playing good guys had reduced many spaces for Bruce  himself. Without those two we can see more of Bruce kicking, fighting and  flying.<br />To name 'Enter the Dragon' as the best martial arts movie is too  misleading. For those who like to watch real and pure martial arts I  recommend other Bruce Lee films (The Chinese Connection and The Way of the  Dragon) or Jackie Chan films (Wheels On Meals or Dragons Forever).
B000002KDS|5.0|From start to finish, this is the best album ever from Alice. It can be really fun and really dark. Marilyn Manson only wishes he could put out something this good. Buy it now and play it loud!

0451196716|5.0|I started this book early one night and just kept reading. The chapter ends are so Strategically  placed that you cant stop. Each character is described in depth, so you feel bad when each one dies. Each area of the  race has a new problem,(my favorite was the 21 tounge salute). The  objective in this was great. It reminds me of school. If you fall below a  65 3 times, they are just a warning. But if you fall below a 65 a fourth  time, it's over. If you outlast everyone else you are set for life, but  don't be the first to buy your ticket...
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Wow. This new a-ha album is the album I always wished they made. A-ha suffered greatly from never being able to sustain an album with sheer quality, they've cracked it. Maybe it took this time for them to open up  and give more meaning to their songs. A classic example of that is the  haunting &quot;To let you win&quot; which stands out as a major progression  in Morten's songwriting ability which was only hinted at on his debut album  Wild Seed. &quot;Velvet&quot; will be familiar to the die hard fans, but  this track now oozes class with Morten's vocal, which will always have been  a classic in it's own right. A pleasant surprise was the exceptional  &quot;I wish I cared&quot;, written by Magne on his own, this is his best  song to date, although he'll never admit it. <br />This is not a singles album  in a commercial sense, apart from the first single &quot;Summer moved  on&quot; and the insanely catchy &quot;You'll never get over me&quot; which  will drive you to heaven with it's stunning melody and backing vocals you  would be pushed to find songs which will do well in the current market  place. My only hope is that A-ha will defy that, as their record deal  depends on this album being successful. Even if this is not the case and  they never make another album I will always be grateful that they found the  will and resolve to make this album which has touched a part of me I  thought was lost forever.
B00003XB8K|5.0|Micheal Creut rocks big time. I have listened to  camera obscura(track 9) dozens of times, and its momentum still astounds me. I don't understand why so many of the comments detract from his vocal contribution. His potent  gravely voice is amony the stronger elements at play here. The meditative  quality of their earlier albums is still very much at play on selected  tracks (e.g. tracks 4 and 6). In addition, thaere are at least three very  releasable singles. &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot;, &quot;THe Gravity of  Love&quot;, and &quot;SIlence Must be Heard&quot; are the most salient  examples of this. THe use of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; is most effective  because they present it in numerous forms, thereby varying its effect.   It's use in &quot;THe Gravity of Love&quot; is quite intoxicating.
0920236251|5.0|I got this book for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it.  She especially likes reading about how the princess outsmarts the dragon. At the end, she gets mad at the prince for being a &quot;mean guy&quot; and is  glad when the princess tells him he is a bum.  It has been a great book for  teaching her to stick up for herself.
B00003CX6P|4.0|Many people have not yet picked up on the fact that this movie is a remake of a 1960's (Italian ?) movie &quot;Purple Noon&quot;.<br />Matt Damon plays a very disturbed character, who is caught up living a lie that starts off  relatively innocuously, but takes on very evil overtones as the movie  progresses.<br />The scenery in the movie is awesome.  The actors work well  together to produce a good thriller.<br />The only critisism is that the movie  could have been 20 minutes shorter, without sacrificing the quality of the  movie.
6302779278|1.0|About 3 reviewers below saida this is the greatest movie ever made... I dont need to say anything more, except: it is not !  This is pure Hollywoodian garbage, movie in its lowest level, a mere vehicle for Houston show her &quot;great&quot; voice and her total incapacity to act !  (as  CIndy Crawford. As always, Costner is ridiculous.
0375707972|3.0|A plethora of thoughful insights hung on an improbable plot line written beautifully.
6305622825|5.0|\\"Entrapment\\" certainly has some of the hallmarks of a good Bond film and I don't suppose Mr. Connery will mind the comparison being made. At his age, to pull off such a great movie must be satisfying indeed. One can't help  thinking that placing Catherine Zeta-Jones at his disposal, so to speak,  must have acted as something of a stimulant. They make a great pair.<br />If  adventure is all you are after, it's here. If travel interests you, even  the armchair variety, you've got that too. If stunts are needed, there are  one or two of those. And as for the trap that is carefully being set even  as we are watching, well, I'll just say be careful that you don't fall into  it yourself. An excellent piece of cinema to be compared favourably not  only with the Bond films, but \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" as well. Hard to  imagine anyone being too disappointed.
0767802659|5.0|Great Movie. Action Packed but Smart as well. A Good Satire that works on multiple levels. You'll Enjoy this one!
0517122707|5.0|It is the absurdity of a people and their habits and their views and their daily quests to be right that makes this book not just funny but rather touchingly and hauntingly funny.  It is a funny that cannot be shaken.  Even after you read this book, its characters will replay in yout head.   Being from New Orleans, I know the city as a bunch of little cities which  make up the greater metropolis, and each of the smaller parts is on a quest  to present its part as the only right part.  John Kennedy Toole has tapped  in to our absurdity in grand style and made me laugh at the way humanity  seeks balance by putting the rest of the world on opposite ends of a bizare  scale.  I wish that John Kennedy Toole were still here to look at our  current views and routines and develop new characters to represent each of  us; I wish he could still offer us each 12 inches of paradise just as he  did in the Quarter while lazily pushing his rolling hot dog cart through  the New Orleans humidity.  Humans!  You gotta' love us!  Our ability to  scrutinize ourselves and laugh at ourselves is at its finest in this great  novel.
B00003ZA0T|5.0|I was so impressed by the song &quot;wait and bleed&quot; I drove to Wall-Mart and Picked up my on copy and have proudly displayed it in my room to sybolize a master design of lyrics and rythm! But I must confess, I am  OUT RAGED AT THE FACT THAT SLIPKNOT IS TO GOOD FOR US SIMPELTONS TO MAKE A  FRESHER ALBUM!  WERE ARE YOU SLIPKNOT?
B000002AVF|1.0|In going against the mainstream, I know people will always rip scorn uppon my reviews, but I dont care. I think people who liked this album are the same kind of people who likes MADONNA, MICHAEL JACKSON, SHANA TWAIN,  WHITNEY HOUSTON and other media phenomenons around the world. Carey is not  a Paul mcCartney, who is a real solo-artist, composer, singer,  instrumentist, with an indenpendent mind. Carey has only her stupendous  voice, which she is wasting screaming like a banshee intead of singing.
0788811355|5.0|I have no doubt that \\"The English Patient\\" is a good book as well: I've not read it. The scenario of the film is such that we can only hope most of its originality lay with its author, Michael Ondaatje. What an achievement! Mix passion, history and adventure, love and war, high drama and pathos, as  well as wonderful photography, all up together, and you might get anything  at all as a result. What Best Director Anthony Minghella has come up with  is, however, something nearing the zenith of cinematographic  perfection.<br />An epic film taking us through the immense dustbowl of a  world in crisis (with the intriguing balance of archaeology and ancient  cultures off slightly to one side), and using the war as a backdrop for  both human folly and grandeur, \\"The English Patient\\" simply should not be  missed.
6305800073|3.0|That's right, I was born and raised in Falls City, NE.  John Lotter used to chase me home from elementary school, I had a locker next to Marvin (Tom hated being called that) when I was a sophmore in high school.  He used to  drink peach snaups out of a Pepsi can.  John was MUCH meaner looking and  Tom A LOT dorkier.  Though I thought the actors betrayed Lana and her white  trash friends brilliantly.  But as the title of this review says, I  wouldn't have watched it if I wasn't from Falls City myself.
B000002L9M|4.0|A pseudo-Winston Churchill [DM] begins the album with a heavily muffled quote about an enigmatic `brief period of rejoicing'.  Brief indeed, the atmosphere will get steadily darker and palpably thick. If one inhales they  can almost choke on the menace. This is Depeche Mode at their most starkly  melancholy and austere. Although Question of Time rises from the morass  with its contagious beat it is more than offset by the brilliant Flies on  the Windscreen urging, no, demanding love in the midst of a nuclear  holocaust. Black Celebration is my second favorite studio album behind  MFtM.  The trademark sound of their middle period which saw its birth in  Some Great Reward continues to grow like a virus in this offering,  culminating in Music for the Masses. The musical order flows wonderfully  for the first part of the album Black Celebration leads to Fly on the  Windscreen to Question of Lust and then to Martin's beautiful rendition of  Sometimes, in an almost heartbeat metronome. Some songs seem a bit out of  place thematically, like New Dress and Here is the House which haven't  weathered the years as well as others.  World Full of Nothing and But Not  Tonight leave the barest glimpse of hope available in this darkly tinged  oblation. Though not as new fan accessible as the commercial Violator or  the polished MFtM this is still an excellent jumping in point and highly  recommended.
B000002BQK|1.0|THis girl is very badly produced, she could be much better if people didnt tell her to scream instead of singing. Of course her numbers in records sold and tours are great, but this CD shows the same mistakes as  before: screming instead of singing, pop-corn lyrics, electronic drumming.
B000009ED0|4.0|THIS ALBUM IS A SO COOL!  SONGS LIKE DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE ANDBAWITDABA GET ME SO PUMPED UP BEFORE I GO TO SCHOOL...THEN I WALKAROUND SCHOOL LIKE AN &quot;AMERICAN BAD A...&quot;..I WOULD HAVE GAVE IT 5 STARS BUT THERES TOO MANY CURSES SO 4 IS GOOD FOR NOW
0792151712|5.0|Right at the start of this intriguing movie, we see a robot probe going through the innards of the actual Titanic, lying deep in the ocean off Canada's Grand Banks. The probe is searching for something and for a while, it seems as though those manipulating the probe from above might have got  lucky. But the diamonds and other jewels they are hoping to lay their hands  on are not there, and they have to be contented with a drawing and other  knick-knacks, instead.<br />That drawing turns into an old lady who, as if  slowly awakening from a long night's dreaming, begins to recall the events  leading up to its creation by a young artist. And that leads to the movie  \\"Titanic.\\" It's very artfully done and the only question we might still  have, near the end, as that old lady returns those much sought after  diamonds to the depths where they were supposed to have lain for so long,  is: what are we searching for? What is down there, in that icy immovable  hulk? James Cameron has asked the question. Maybe it's the film's real  strength. Maybe it's what keeps us guessing all the time, even throughout  the fictional recreation. What's down there for us?<br />Whatever the answer,  I believe you'll enjoy the voyage...all the way down.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time four days ago and I havenot been able to get it out of my head since.  It's one of thosemovies that stays with you.  I had no desire to see it, but I am soglad that I did.  I definitely recommend it.  It was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
0767802659|4.0|I don't think most people &quot;got it&quot; after seeing Starship Troopers. The biggest complaint seems to be about the casting.  A lot of young and gorgeous actors in the lead roles then watching them get ripped  to shreds. It is supposed to play out as a purposely reversal of  &quot;Aliens&quot;<br />I thoughly enjoyed Paul Verhoven's take on the classic  Robert Heinlein novel. First off, they are two very different entities.  While the movie does keep the basic storyline, that's where it ends. If  anything Full Metal Jacket would be a closer adaptation of Starship Trooper  the novel.<br />Verhoeven plays up the cold fascist militaristic atmosphere  which purposely plays out as quite humorous and the the gigantic insect  creatures which are a special effects extravaganza. The script by RoboCop  writer Ed Neumeier has some fun with the novel. The diologue is simplistic,  it's supposed to be.  I laugh more than cring watching Denise Richards,  who's drop dead gorgeous and really is a &quot;space cadet&quot; Starship  Troopers is supposed to play out as a &quot;Pretty things go to war&quot;  kinda like driving your brand new Porsche into the city, through giant  potholes, crazy cab drivers, car thieves and such.  <br />This DVD edition is  first rate with a nice collection additional material on the making of this  loud, gory, and tongue in cheek action film. It's a movie... so don't take  it so seriously.
B000001FLA|3.0|Singer Mark Goals tried hard, and the result was a very good album. It is a shame the singer lasted so short..
6302732786|5.0|I had the extreme pleasure of watching this concert live on t.v. the night it aired in 92'.  It was indeed the biggest standoff in history to the incomparable Freddie Mercury, who was gone well before his time.  The video is excellent, I have two copies. We miss you, Freddie! I hope the video is  released again, what a wonderful way to raise money for AIDS, and remember  a star.
080010367X|5.0|There are a number of difficult subjects in cinema, one of them being that of extra-terrestrial life. Like many pet subjects that appeal to a wide range of people, there is a danger of creating something which heads directly for the middle ground and leaves us with no sense of  accomplishment: a bit like safe sex, in a way - safe cinema. So when a  movie tackles a difficult subject in an original way, we are so much more  pleased by the result, for having had so much trash run by us before.  That's how I feel about \\"Men in Black,\\" a film I resisted seeing for months  if not years, before finally having to admit that it's a beauty in a class  of its own. <br />Of course there is a certain amount of mainstream Hollywood  madness, but this is beautifully tempered by an interesting scenario and  some highly credible acting. The special effects also tend to work because  we are willing to accept the film's odd reality. I even found myself  accepting, to my amazement, the creature at the end of the film - I had  been able to buy what director Barry Sonnenfeld was selling. I won't say  the film is that funny - it is not a classic comedy at all. Yet it has  underlying currents of humour as well, and frankly, I think that adding up  all the pluses gives a very solid (and surprising) score indeed.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Along with the first compilation, the 1962-1966 'Red' album, this two CD set fills out most of the Beatles best known songs.  <br />My only critism of the 'best of' series is that most of Revolver was omitted, with only Yellow  Submarine and Elanore Rigby representing that fine period.  I would have  moved those two Revolver tracks to the second, renaming it 1966-1970, and  included Taxman, Got To Get You Into My Life and And Your Bird Can Sing. In  addition I would have added three 'B' sides to better know htis;Rain, the  'B' side to Paperback Writer, The Inner Light, the 'B' side to Lady  Madonna, and the 'B' side to Let It Be, You Know My Name (Look Up My  Number).  This and the first set will leave you gasping for more!
B000002MP2|4.0|I guess GREEN DAY is the best &quot;three chords-band&quot; that surge in the rock scenario since RAMONES. Their simple songs are played with amazing energy, in great part due to their phenomenal drummer, who plays his kit  with masterful creativity and power. The vocals are ok, thight, strong,  simple. Great CD, where almost all the songs qualify as great tunes.
B000001FOS|1.0|THe Swede master released a total commercial failure. Look at the tittle tracks &quot;HEAVEN TONIGHT&quot;, &quot;NOW IS THE TIME&quot;, &quot;HOLD ON&quot;. COmpare them with &quot;I AM A VIKING&quot;, &quot;ILL SEE THE  LIGHT TONIGHT&quot;, etc. Sad. The proof that he tried so hard to be  totally commercial was the addiction of singer Joe Lynn Turner, who never  convinced anyone.
B000023X9W|5.0|This is a moving record that evokes, and adds to the legacy, of Mr. Young's best introspective, acoustic work. For those who insist on distinguishing between the electric and acoustic Neil Young, this record is  the off-spring of such gems as &quot;Harvest,&quot; &quot;Comes A  Time,&quot; &quot;Old Ways&quot; (to a certain extent), and &quot;Harvest  Moon.&quot; That said, it stands on its own and will likely still be  well-regarded well down the line.
0792139771|5.0|Whether or not Braveheart is historic correct/incorrect is not very important, is it? The facts about what happened in the 13th century is not very easy to get, since it is usually the winners who write the history.  Would it be very difficult for the King of the 13th century England to  manipulate facts, and maybe change the dates of events. I am not saying  that Braveheart tells the true story, or the opposite, and I really does  not care. See the movie and enjoy the great battlescenes and the great  acting in it.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Best of compilation from the second era of the group.  Includes both album cuts and singles.  This and the red album give you a comprehensive sampling of the group's most seminal recordings.
0553573403|5.0|I literally picked this book up at the bookstore based entirely on its cool cover. But the cover does not lie. This book has it all. Lots of action, great characters, mystery, intrigue. You name it, it's got it.  Definitely one of the best in the genre.
079213690X|4.0|Although not being historically accurate, this picture is very entertaining, gripping. Gibson won the Directors Oscar in a brilliant way. There are a lot of blood, of course. The only real weak spot is the  unconvincing romance between Wallace and Princess Isaballa.
B000002MI4|5.0|...were really rock-and-rollers. And this is their legacy: Elvis Costello, in musical and lyrical collaboration with the esteemed and equally adventurous Brodsky Quartet, has created an engaging song cycle loosely  inspired by an article about a Veronese professor who actually collects  letters sent to Shakespeare's Juliet. Each song suggests some form of  epistle: a graffito, a brash direct mail come-on, a suicide note, a divorce  decree, a letter from the front. Costello's voice is perfectly suited to  the rich, vibrant Brodsky strings. In some instances they sound like five  stringed instruments; other times they are five voices. Exquisite. This is  not a classical record. Listen to &quot;Jacksons, Monk and Rowe&quot; and  tell me that isn't Motown you're hearing. Where other artists (some of whom  are quite close to Mr. Costello) strive to create modern classical music,  Elvis and the Brodskys succeed by eschewing convention in favor of what's  right for each letter. And there are a few musical quotes that will bring a  smile, as well. Particularly in &quot;I Almost Had a Weakness.&quot; Bear  in mind the label that issued this disc (Warner Bros.) as you listen to  that track. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but you owe it to  yourself to hear it. If only to renew your faith in the potential of  rock-and-roll.
B00000DBXL|5.0|i first heard cake when i dl 'i will survive' -- i was hooked! i've got all three albums now, and i think this one is the best.  for the novice, perhaps start with 'going the distance' or 'let me go' or 'you turn the  screws', 'hem of your garment', so many great songs.  the later stuff is  more accessible than the earlier stuff, more melodic, the humor is readily  apparent.  all that hooting and stuff, god it's great! music for anytime  anywhere.  big thank you to cake, for transforming the face of sound.
B00000163G|5.0|The first thing that I wondered was if the album would be a commentary about his life, and thoughts about the changes that was needed. Or would it be a album filled with anger and hate? The answer, according to me, is  both! All of Tupac's best selling singles are on this CD; How Do You Want  It, California Love, I Aint Mad At Cha and a lot of others. One of my  favorite songs is on CD I, Only God Can Judge Me, the retrospective lyrics  and the cool beats makes it an hit in my ears. This CD represents both  sides of Tupac, the caring and telling rapper and the gangsta' rapper that  sweeps the table with his fast and intense lyrics and the slamming beats.  Often a double album means uneven quality. There are too many songs that  stay at the average level, but other songs easily compensate them. This  album screams West Coast sound and that means banging beats that you just  have to listen too! The guest rappers are the best ones that have ever been  together on an album, including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, E40, Method Man,  Redman, Nate Dogg and a bunch of others. You'll have to buy or listen to  this album, 'cause it's a classic already.
B000002UAU|5.0|Though I came into this album long after its initial appearance on the music scene, it transformed my entire appreciation of virtually all pop music, even music I had grown to love.  This album is so completely  brilliant, from the poetry of its varied lyrics, to the soaring and  indelible melodies, to the experimentation evident in every song, both  vocally and with every instrument.  Each and every song has retained its  instant power, from the joyful It's Getting Better to the frightening and  powerful Day In The Life.  This is perfect, perfect pop music, the album  that redefined everything we still hear today on the radio and on our  stereos. It is evocative, mesmerizing and more than a little melancholy,  beside being a feast for the ears. If you have not yet, go there - now.
B000001FDQ|4.0|Very original, it set the pattern for a lot o &quot;copiers&quot; to follow. It has a lot of instrumental tunes, very good, and the ones which features Scott Soto are great , also.
B000002ADT|5.0|listening to this album somehow puts you into the head of this amazing musical collective.  somehow, you UNDERSTAND the music.  you fall in love with the music.  THAT is what this album does.  kind of blue makes you feel  like you're a little bit more important, and that life has just a tad bit  more meaning than previously assumed.  every track, scetched by miles just  hours before the recording was made, are MILEStones in jazz history.  what  made the record so important then and now is the fact that these takes  were, for the most part, the first time the group attempted playing them.   there is a freshness to the music that can't be repeated.  THAT is why this  record is so special.  You will be hard-pressed to find genius of this  magnatude on any other recording in your collection.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is definately the most underrated movie of last year!  When I rented this movie I was thinking it was not going to be that good because it was not in theaters for too long.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only  is Brad Pitt a hottie in this film, but the story line is great and even  throws you a twist at the end!  A Must see!
0793927501|5.0|Couldn't have been better.  Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, and Elle McPherson star in an awesome film from director Lee Tamori, with a great moral, great lesson, great number of suspenseful scenes, and is just plain  a great flick.    Hopkins plays billionaire Charles Morse, who with his  wife (McPherson) and photographer friend Robert Green (Baldwin) and his  partner decide to take a trip to the wild backwoods of Alaska.  When Morse,  Green, and their friend are thrown into the wilderness after a plane crash  in a lake in the middle of who knows where, the group of men must add up  eachother's bravery and try to escape from the edge, and not &quot;die of  shame&quot;, as quoted by Hopkins, while being pursued by a goliath kodiak  bear.  YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's rated R, BUT IT'S WORTH  SEEING!
6301735048|1.0|This movie failed miserably in the box-office? Why? Because people couldnt understand its artistic merits? Its deep ideas? No. It failed just because the public is not so dumb as the executives think. The plot here is ridiculous, cheap.
630281474X|5.0|I've seen just about every Dracula movie ever produced, and I would say that &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; is the best of them all.  I really can't find any flaws with it.  Christopher Lee is far superior to Bela Lugosi or any other actor who portrayed the evil Count.  As usual, Peter Cushing is  outstanding, giving a dynamite performance as Dr. Van Helsing.  The rest of  the cast is fine too.
B000000OUJ|5.0|The GZA is a complex, but hardcore artist who put out a classic in the making. Liquid Swords is a must get for any Wu-Tang fan. Songs like &quot;Cold World&quot;, &quot;4th Chamber&quot;, &quot;Shadowboxin'&quot;,  &quot;Swordsman&quot;, &quot;Investigative Reports&quot;, and my favorite  &quot;Duel Of The Iron Mic&quot; makes this album historic. This is  definately a must get. Peace to the Wu.
B00004SVID|5.0|I recently had my car stereo stolen. I promised never, ever to get a car stereo again, specially not the kind I had, a really expensive one. Then, this morning, I got my copy of &quot;Is There Anybody...&quot; Let me just  say: All in all it's just Another Car Stereo in the Works...It sounds as  crisp as the original (I should know, I'm 30 already!)...But if you  listened to this record for the first time when you were in  high-school,  you remain forever 12, forever pissed-off : Good!...Besides, they should  put a warning label on this CD: &quot;Contains no &quot;Live&quot;  simplification of &quot;Tricky&quot; studio sounds.&quot; Unlike many  bands, PF doesn't just play a &quot;sketchy&quot; live version of their  studio work... listen carefully and they even manage to throw some new  layers of sound, especially when they build up towards Part 1...
0783216084|4.0|This is the first commercial success for Spielberg, but it is not a comercial movie. THe characters have a life of their own, its just not special effects. THere is not present, either, the later traditional  SPielbergs foolish sentimentalism. The movie works as a fine piece of  Swiss watches, even when you notice how the shark is so bad produced, due  to lack of adequated special effects at the time.
0767817443|2.0|This movie isn't terrible, but it bears little resemblance to the Japanese version of Godzilla that became so popular all over the world.  This version is part Jurassic Park, King Kong, Anaconda, and other similar movies.  The producers of this film must have lost their focus somewhere  along the way.  Also, the 1998 &quot;Godzilla&quot; was incredibly  overhyped, especially by gullible fans on the Internet who thought it would  be a great film.
B000046PVN|5.0|After buying the SUPERMAN THE MOVIE score on vinyl, then twice on cd(one was a rerecording), It's about time they got it right with this excellent release from Rhino. This cd is the definitive presentation of one of John  Williams greatest scores. It not only includes every bit of music from the  film, but also unused and alternate music written for scenes like the  opening Planet Krypton scene and the flying sequence which has no less than  four versions(vocals and non vocals) on the cd including a dated pop-synth  version which was wisely not used in the movie. This work is Williams and  the LSO at their best. It's great that record companies like Rhino step up  and present great movie scores like BEN-HUR, POLTERGEIST, and SUPERMAN in  their entirety and release first rate albums. This is the only Superman cd  you'll ever need.
0440234743|4.0|Through about three-quarters of this book, I was spellbound. I thought to myself, &quot;Well, Grisham has me hooked again!&quot; But the plot lost steam dramatically to me and kind of fizzled out to the end. To me the novel peaked in the middle and floundered. I enjoyed the turnaround in Nate  O'Riley's character. If the end of the book had been better, I would have  given this 5 stars.
6303269826|2.0|After winning a lot of Oscars for the great &quot;DANCE WITH WOLVES&quot;, Costner apparently wente berserk, and started to think hes the greatest actor of all mankind!  One of the movies that shows this new phase is this one. The general idea is good, tryin to make a &quot;real&quot; portrait of  Wearp, not a action-filled package as &quot;TOMBSTONE&quot;. But Costners  acting is arrogant, boring, in a way that eclypses all the merits of the  movie (mainly, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday)
0783235607|5.0|This is the movie that set the standard for horror films and makes most of them pale in comparison.  Hitchcock set out to make his audience scream and succeeded beyond his wildest expectations; I saw &quot;Psycho&quot; when it was first released and the screams almost lifted the roof off the theater.  Filming the movie in black and white was a stroke of genius; the spooky  impact would have been much diminished if it had been shot in color.  And  Lord, that music... Bernard Herrmann's score helped make &quot;Psycho&quot;  the total horror ride it is, screechy violins and all.  The cast is  excellent throughout.  Anthony Perkins is, and always will be, Norman  Bates.  Janet Leigh is terrific as Marian Crane, John Gavin and Vera Miles  give great performances as her boyfriend and her sister, and Martin Balsam  is wonderful as the cynical private eye Arbogast, who makes one trip too  many to the Bates Motel.  Hitchcock knows how to frame his shots; the scene  of Vera Miles descending the cellar stairs and finding Mrs. Bates is a  heart-stopper no matter how many times you watch it.  With Norman Bates,  Hitchcock added an unforgettable figure to the horror pantheon, and this  movie will surely live as one of the great horror classics of all time.  They just don't make 'em like this any more.
078062999X|5.0|We watched this in school as part of our Hamlet unit. I must say I've never been as intriguied and entertained more by a Shakseperean play gone Hollywood. This one is definately a winner. The acting was amazing + the lines were practically and literally word 4 word. the only thing that may  have lowered the experience for me was the amount of time to watch it, but  it's definately worth it.<br />2 thumbs up!<br />5 Stars!
B00000K32J|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed Lord of the Dance tremendously, but the whole dance troupe has outdone itself in this expanded version -- Feet of Flames.  It is still Lord or the Dance, but now has a few added scenes/dances and  some of the originals seem to have been improved some.  We still love Lord  of the Dance, but Feet of Flames is so much better.<br /> One of the notable  things about Feet of Flames is the amazing music and dance make you feel  wonderful ... very uplifting.<br /><br />We watch this show often and wish  Feet of Flames would come out on DVD (which lasts a lifetime), but until  then I am buying a second copy because we don't want to be without a copy  someday when we wear out the video and it goes OOP!
B000003CMB|5.0|If you are interested in this CD, you may want to check out &quot;The Fillmore Concerts&quot;:<br />&quot;The Allman Brothers at Fillmore East&quot; was taken from 4 shows over a 2 day period.  Each show was over 2 hours  long.  This was boiled down to a 2 LP set lasting around 75 minutes.  When  CD technology was first introduced, the maximum length of a CD was just  over 74 minutes.  So when this album was first released as a CD, it was as  a 2 CD set.  Now that production techniques have improved so that more of  the disc can used, the maximum playing time on a disc is 80 minutes.  This  makes it possible to rerelease the complete album on a single disc at a  lower price (at least the record companies will argue that is why the price  is lower..it costs just pennies to manufacture a CD).<br />&quot;The Fillmore  Concerts&quot; is the same as this album, but comes on 2 CD's and is nearly  twice as long.  It more closely matches a complete show.  (But it does cost  twice as much and most of the extra music can be found on &quot;Eat A  Peach&quot; or elsewhere). It is refreshing to hear the complete Mountain  Jam follow Whipping Post, instead of the first few notes.<br />One of the best  live albums ever made.  Fantastic guitar duets, great rhythm section and  even Greg Allman was contributing on keyboards.  Although this was the  origin of the Southern Rock movement, this album is more straight ahead  rock and blues.  None of the later Southern bands, with their multi-guitar  attacks, came close to capturing this sound.
B000002KBH|5.0|this album along with workingman's dead is why skeletons in the closet was never necessary. Every song is a winner. (I disagree with Glenn Wiener) Attics of my Life contains some of the finest harmony the Dead ever  produced. VH1 devotes an hour long special to this album (which is well  worth watching) and in it, Phil explains that they met with Crosby, Stills,  and Nash for this album. Crosby, etc gave them pointers on vocal harmony  while the dead gave them some pointers on jamming.         Defintetly check  this album out for the folky side of the dead!
6303212263|5.0|When I first saw this movie when I was a little kid I loved every minute of it. The special effects are great and the music is wonderful. I have all the Superman movies, including the soundtrack. Out of all of them I think I like this one the best because it really tells the story. I wonder when the  DVD version's going to come out because that would be sweet if they had a  DVD version out with new scenes, original theatrical trailer, and the  making. But I think this is one of the best Superman movies ever made and  great to own on video!
6305807086|5.0|This film is great.  I saw it and was amazed, it used the point of view like a paint brush and the plot kept me guessing.  It is unlike any thing else.  I would definately recomend this film to anyone wanting to view their world a little differently.
B00003CXDU|5.0|In terms of boigraphies, Galaxy Quest could be the unofficial Star Trek biography. Taking audiences behind the scenes to see the relationships of the Star Trek cast members an capturing the stereotypical Star Trek moment, Galaxy Quest provides quality family entertainment that makes you laugh  uncontrollably and makes you want to come back again and again. Excellent  script-writing and fantastic humor makes this movie one you will want to  own for yourself.
B000002UVX|5.0|This one is a classic. Who Knows is a gem and Machine Gun is Hendrix at his wildest. Hendrix was at his best with the Experience, but with Band of Gypsies, he was able to showcase his guitar work. This is the best the trio  has to offer and a must own Hendrix CD.
B00004S96B|5.0|Five stars are NOT NEARLY enough for this CD. I compared the &quot;regular&quot; version and the &quot;gold&quot; version of this CD one track at the time and came to the conclusion the other albums should be  released on this label RIGHT NOW!  I own several other Gold discs, and  this one is a classic example of a true improvement in sound quality. See  it as the difference between an old vinil album found in the attic from the  &quot;pre CD&quot; era and the first time you heard the same album on CD.  Well... The same shock is about to happen here...
0440234743|5.0|He just keeps them coming.  Just when we thought he might exhaust his supply of stories about crooked law firms hunting down those who dare to cross them, Grisham turns out this novel which somehow makes estate law  thrilling.  This book is about more than law--it deals with faith,  redemption, and addictions, too.  While telling an engrossing tale, Grisham  gives us fun characters.  After all, who can resist cheering against the  greedy, unscrupulous Phelan heirs? This is one of Grisham's best.

B000002505|3.0|Best enjoyed by those who are fully au fait with John McLaughlan and Santana, this music reflects the journey of search and discovery that Carlos (more so than John) was undertaking at the time. Musically Carlos finds himself on McLaughlan's turf here, but fortunately not fully out of  his depth.  It is interesting to note the difference in styles between the  two, yet at times they are almost indistinguishable.<br />Radically different  for Santana fans, but more familiar sounds for McLaughlan followers, this  is not an easy album to digest for the average listener, as this is  \\"devotional\\" music by two soul brothers experiencing life and spirituality  to the fullest.  No matter what one may think of Guru Sri Chinmoi and  others like him, Carlos' and John's intentions were sincere.  This is an  important album because it is a snap shot of Carlos' evolutionary path from  his fiery debut album, through his spiritual and musical development to  this day.<br />Critics of Carlos Santana often complain that he's drifted from  his roots, the music that made him famous (Santana, Abraxas, Santana III  &amp; Caravanserai), forgetting that he's no ordinary musician, possessing  extraordinary emotions that crave for beyond the material.  As such Santana  is compelled to explore, change, experiment and indulge.  Indeed this album  has been at times described as an indulgent jam session, but such a  statement one suspects can only be made by someone lacking in understanding  of what Santana and McLaughan are (or were) all about.<br />Comprising of five  tracks, this album is a little short-lived. The last track \\"Meditation\\" can  only be described as beautiful, and should have been stretched further  especially in an album of this nature.   The second track is a sensitive  rendition of John Coltrane's  \\"Naima\\", softly played on acoustic guitar  serves as a good lead-in to \\"The Life Divine\\" which is a rather intense  piece.<br />Published in June 1973, this album quickly went goldand includes  Billy Cobham, Armando Peraza, Don Alias, Larry Young, and Doug Rauch, but  you will not see these names on the CD sleeve.<br />Excepting for the track  titles, the CD sleeve is devoid of any useful information or credits.
0140288503|4.0|Bowden does an excellent job recounting the battle here.  The detail is excellent and gives the reader a very good picture of how the Battle of Mogadishu played out.  What is missing is the larger context of the overall  Somalia crisis.  For example, there is no analysis of what role  the Somali  warlord Aidid played in coordinating the battle, nor of the broader  American mission there.  Bowden makes a few attempts to give the Somali  perspective, but they are disjointed at best.  All that said, Bowden admits  his goal was not to write a comprehensive history of the situation.  He  does an excellent job of what he set out to do-- recount the battle.  But  as a reader, I found myself wishing for more information about the larger  context.  In short, he does a great job answering who, what, when, and  where, but leaves alot of unanswered whys.

0553296981|5.0|This book... my goodness you really can't sum it up! I think it should be a required reading book for every school in the US. It is very inspirational and I think that after reading this you really realize how  much you take for granted. Its a really good book and I reccomend it to  anyone who's never read it.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone. It has great effects and good story line. It's a must-see!
B000002BE9|5.0|I absolutely love Fiona Apple. Her music is some of the most powerful in all of music today. She is one the few musicians (especially in pop-music) who actually put everything she has into every song. &quot;Sullen  Girl&quot; and &quot;Never Is A Promise&quot; happen to be my two favorite  tracks on Tidal but &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; is a faboulous song as well.   Fiona Apple is a blessing to music. Please keep it up Fiona because music  needs a voice like yours.
B00003CXDU|5.0|I was eager to see this movie, hoping it was going to be as good as I dreamed it would be, so many hyped up Box Office megahits fell disappointingly short, (example; Matrix! ).  It was with great relief that this movie flew into the Wonderfully Brilliant catagory, Im pleased to inform you that Galaxy Quest is a fun, funny, fantastic film, for families  to watch without the worry of excessive violence (Well theres a little bit,  and it also suggests some form of Xenocide and canibalism!  but aside from  that its pretty tame!) <br />The Actors in my opinion, are all stars, Tim  Allen may have been the head honcho but every actor contributed to the  films overall appeal I particularily enjoyed  Sigorney in the role of the  stereotypical Blonde actress (A far cry from her Ripley persona! ) <br />This  movie is pure entertainment, paying a high quality tribute to those earlier  Scifi shows, perhaps letting people who dont normally watch classic Scifi  relics (Yep Star Trek, and lost in space etc! ), a chance to view these  series from a new perspective, whether you enjoy Scifi or not Im quite sure  you will have a smile on your face and a new appreciation for a genre that  has spawned a number of truely corny and whacky shows, SO PLEASE WATCH THIS  MOVIE. YOU WONT REGRET IT!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple had an extremely tall order in front of her when she put this album out becasue it was following up Tidal, which was in my opinion was one of the best albums of the 90's.  Well she succeeded beautifully.   &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; is a worthy follow up to &quot;Tidal&quot; and  in some peoples eyes even succeeds it.  Personally I am not sure which one  I like better becasue they both have a lot to say. Fiona's voice is so  beautiful and yet haunting at the same time.  Every song on the album is  great. Fiona is one those musicians who you can just put on the enitre  album and listen to every cut.  If she has done this great on just her  second album then the future is very bright for this talented woman.
B00004SVIK|5.0|Just amazing how good they sounded ... this band should be awarded for their live/technical achievements alone.  I think Roger Waters must have much to do with this as his concert sound parallels what you hear on this  album while PF did'nt seem to achieve the same fidelity in the post Roger  years.  I hope they release the video. Anyways, they are so talented and  unique !   I just laugh (or is it cry) when I compare other artists/bands  with Pink Floyd.
B000002H6C|5.0|Bad sound quality and cheap production maybe present,but this album is a classic nonetheless! Yes, I wish you could hear the bass better, but the songs themselves are not only heavy, but very ambitious. 'One' alone is  every reason to buy it. I'm glad I did not review this CD after I just got  it, because it takes time to really grow on you! But when it does, you  won't be able stop listening to it. Metallica rules! Out.
B000002KAT|5.0|All I have to say about this ablum is that if you listen to song 7, Ballerina, and do not get it, then you have no soul.
B000002UUX|5.0|Kicking it off with the double-song 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due', this CD shows Mustaine and the boys at their finest. The aforementioned opener is a classic, as well as 'Hangar 18', 'Take No Prisoners', 'Five Magics',  'Tornado Of Souls', and 'Rust In Peace...Polaris'. Definately 5 stars! I  just wish there were more songs! My favorite is 'Hanger 18'. It's the  killer riff from Hell. Also of note: check out the cover art. It fits  perfectly with the concept of the album(I like how they put the then  presidents of USA, Russia, UK, Germany, and Japan on it).
B000002UCQ|5.0|They called him the Darkhorse because he was the quiet one. However, Harrison's first lyrical solo album showed that there is something in the way this man creates music. With all the substance characteristic of  Harrison and smooth slide guitar, this album is not preachy like some of  his later works. And the jams with Eric Clapton and others on the last few  track shows that the Darkhorse truely understands what music is all about.<br /><br />This album is all about souls uniting. If you are in to the music  created out of friendships between great musician this is not an album to  pass up. Appearing on this album is Clapton, a song by Dylan, Ringo, Jim  Keltner, and Badfinger.
B000002UDD|4.0|This is good disc. But way too short. Am I the only one who notices that? It is 8 songs in 34 minutes! But other than that, 'So Far, So Good, So What! ' is a good disc. The Sex Pistols cover is funny, but too obvious. '502' is a good song about speeding down the turnpike intoxicated. Complete  with cars vrooming, starting, honking their horns and, of course, crashing.  As well as people and police screaming and swearing at each other on the  highway, it's pretty cool.  It's a good disc. Go check it out!
B000002UYZ|5.0|THIS IS A #1 BEATLES ALBUM!  IM NINE AND LIVE IN FL. I LOVEEEE THE BEATLES AND LOVE THIS ALBUM! ALL PAUL, JOHN, GEORGE AND RINGO ARE ALL GREAT MUSICIANS!   GREAT ALBUM!
B000002H33|5.0|These days, bands release cds that would make better frisbees than, well, CDs. Not the case here. 'Master Of Puppets' conquers everything in its path. It is well-written. Metallica proved that all you needed was 8 solid  songs on one disc and you got yourself a great classic, unlike bands who  release albums of 18 songs of mostly filler. Even better is fact that these  songs are 6-8 minutes long and the disc is 54 minutes long! Anyway, I'm  babbling! Just buy the darn disc and enjoy! Metallica and 'Master Of  Puppets' rule! Cya!
B000002H97|1.0|This album is terrible.  There are one or two okay tracks on it, but you can download those free on the net. For the most part, this thing is all about power: power ballads, power chords, power trips.
B000002H97|5.0|You guys who think Metallica sold-out with this CD need to get a life! This album rules. And anyone who disagrees with me should listen to death metal. Obviously their favorite band is (GASP! )Cannibal Corpse. This  album is the pinnacle of not only metal or thrash, but music in general.  Kudos for Metallica and the Black Album! Cya!
0140177396|4.0|It saddens me that `Of Mice and Men' was the second most frequently banned book in the American public school curriculum of the 1990's. While people have objected to the language, it reflects the times and the circumstances  of the characters (and is better than most of what we might hear in our  modern world). While the ending is horrific, the motivation behind George's  action continues the theme of brotherly love and respect that has been  present throughout the novel. This is a short but challenging read and  prompts questions about relationships, dreams, and our attitude to life and  the taking of it. `Of Mice and Men' confirms Steinbeck's reputation as a  great writer and in no way should this novel be banned.
B000002H2H|5.0|After they made their promising debut 'Kill 'Em All', Metallica released what would be one of the finest examples of music and metal: 'Ride The Lighning'. This is amasing beyond recognition. If I could, i would give it  6 0r 10 stars! It ranges from the brutal('Fight Fire W/ Fire') to the  subtle('Fade To Black'). Every song is a killer classic. My favorite of  all, would have to be 'Call Of Ktulu'. That song is not only heavy, but  beautiful and sad it almost makes me weep. If you don't have this CD, what  are you waiting for? Get it.
B000001FA4|5.0|This release was the one prior to The Joshua Tree. You can hear the evolvement to it here. &quot;Pride (in the name of love)&quot; Has been played to death,However there are at least five other cuts that are as good  or better and are fan all time favorites.<br />A Sort of Homecoming begs you  to slip behind the wheel and drive (alone) taking in the scenery. The  Unforgetable Fire (song) is dreamy and gets better with age. Bad is one of  their all time best cuts -great vocal passion,beautiful rhythm. this is the  one that drove the crowd wild at Live Aid in 1985.<br />The entire disc is a  journey and it captures the bands innocence and drive trying to make a  statement of the times. Only on the Joshua Tree does the band sound better.  It's sad that U2 has become so disinterested and released so much weak  material since. This Cd showed the bands promise which was almost forgotten  by the nineties. <br />The Unforgetable Fire was a classic release. It still  stands today as one of U2's best efforts.<br />A must have for any fan.
B000020617|4.0|&quot;Learn To Fly&quot; is simply superb, the best song on this track.  (The video, included on the ECD, is fantastic as well, I laugh every time I see it).  Other songs on the album, such as &quot;Aurora&quot; and  &quot;Breakout&quot; are good as well, and should keep this album popular  for some time.  It is a pleasant listen, with a few standout tracks.  Even  this pop fan likes it...&lt;evil grin&gt;...Some of their songs are gritty  and tough, but my favorite moments are when they are laughing.  Even though  I don't like their stance on HIV, this album is good...
B0000029AP|5.0|THE BAND: Steven Tyler (vocals, keyboard, harmonica), Joe Perry (guitar), Brad Whitford (guitar), Tom Hamiliton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1975) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 37 minutes. Recorded at the Record Plant, NYC. Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing band pictures, assorted pictures of single \\"45\\"-records, copies of hand written documents from the time, and thank you's. Originally released on Columbia Records, this one is 20-bit digitally remastered (\\"limited edition\\") by Sony/Columbia in 1993.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Aerosmith had small successes with their debut ('73) release as well as \\"Get Your Wings\\" ('74). No one studio album of theirs matched the success of \\"Toys In The Attic\\" (8+ million copies sold). \\"Toys\\" was a versatile and inventive album. Mega hits (right in line with the band's biggest hits, ever) with \\"Walk This Way\\", and \\"Sweet Emotion\\". Mild hits with \\"No More No More\\" and the title track. An R&B workout (silly as it is) with \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\". A power ballad with piano and orchestra with \\"You See Me Crying\\". The deep album cuts are perhaps some of my favorite Aero classic rock tunes... \\"Adam's Apple\\", \\"Uncle Salty\\" and the pre-grunge \\"Round And Round\\". Decades later, you can still hear several songs from this album on the radio, as well as seeing them perform many of these songs live at their concerts. If I had to choose one Aerosmith album to take with me on a trip, two out of three times it would be \\"Rocks\\" (1976). The other one time would be \\"Toys\\". A classic album (5-stars).
0964385619|4.0|I have often wondered why useful and relevant courses are not taught in our schools such as the importance of budgeting and balancing a checkbook, dangers of credit card debt, how compound interest works, and investment  choices.  I was pleased to discover in Rich Dad, Poor Dad that Robert  Kiyosaki feels the same way.  Education has not kept up with our rapidly  changing world and Kiyosaki believes that the gap between the haves and  have-nots in our society is widening.  As his book and ideas get more media  attention and widespread discussion, perhaps educators will take note and  promote changes in school curricula to include courses leading to financial  literacy.<br />This book shows us how to have a money tree later in life by  planting seeds -- investing money -- on assets as early in our working  lives as possible.  Kiyosaki exhorts us to learn the difference between an  asset and a liability and then &quot;concentrate . . . on only buying  income-generating assets.&quot;<br />This book is for readers looking for an  early exit from the rat race who are open to suggestions and motivation  from someone who has already done it.
B000001EUP|5.0|THE BAND: Rudolf Schenker (guitars), Klause Meine (vocals), Matthias Jabs (guitars), Francis Buchholz (bass), Herman Rarebell (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1982) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 37 minutes. Digitally remastered and reissued in 1997. Included with the disc is a 3-page foldout containing song credits and lyrics, one band picture, and thank you's. All music written by Rudolf Schenker. All lyrics written by Meine and Rarebell. Label - Mercury/Polygram.<br /><br />COMMENTS: As far as I'm concerned (like so many reviewers here as well), this is the Scorpions at their peak. This is the band's break-through album. The Scorpions' enjoyed mild success in their native Germany with hits from earlier albums from the 1970's (\\"The Zoo\\", \\"Loving You Sunday Morning\\", \\"Holiday\\", etc), but the album \\"Blackout\\" made them global superstars. The song \\"No One Like You\\" was their first worldwide smash hit - and with good reason. It still sounds fresh decades later. Some awesome deep album cuts like the rocking \\"Dynamite\\", \\"Now!\\" and \\"Blackout\\"; as well as the slower songs like \\"When The Smoke Is Going Down\\" or \\"You Give Me What I Need\\". The Scorpion's next album \\"Love At First Sting\\" (1984) might have sold more records, but it was because of it's predecessor \\"Blackout\\". Note - check out any of their compilations or 'live' albums, and \\"Blackout\\" is the best represented on each. Though \\"Blackout\\" is short at only 9 songs and just under 37 minutes - there is absolutely no filler here. \\"Blackout\\" is the band's heaviest and most solid album ever produced. The 24-bit digitally remastered disc has crisp sound production. Classic disc.
0446525537|4.0|Although this book was predictable, it was also very inspiring. The end was sad, but it also made you smile, because of all the heart-warming events that occured. I recomended this book to many of my friends, and hope you enjoy the book. It's fast to read, and very good. Enjoy!
B000002JS6|5.0|THE BAND: Angus Young (lead guitar), Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), Brian Johnson (vocals), Cliff Williams (bass), Phil Rudd (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: Recorded at Compass Point Studios, in the Bahamas in April/May 1980. Released to the public July 25, 1980. 10 songs clocking in at approximately 42 minutes. All songs written by the Young brothers and Brian Johnson. My standard disc was replaced by the digitally remaster tri-fold package (2003) - which contains a 14-page booklet containing song listing, some band history at the time of the release, black & white band pictures, and thank you's. Label - Sony/Epic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Back In Black\\" is simply a classic rock and roll album. One of the 5 or 10 best, perhaps EVER recorded. The cover - all black with raised tombstone-like lettering - was a tribute to Bon Scott (2/19/80: Scott was found dead in London in the back of a car where he'd passed out the night before from a drinking spree. He choked on his own vomit in his sleep... he was 33). In steps new singer Brian Johnson, previously with the British band Geordie. No one knew what this new change would bring. The Young brothers decided, rather than mope around after Scott's death, to hit the studio and write. Turns out \\"Back In Black\\" was AC/DC's first million dollar seller. It spawned their first Top-40 hit with \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". At one point \\"Back In Black\\" was selling 10,000 copies a day... and as of the year 2003 had sold 19+ million copies. Producer Robert 'Mutt' Lange was quoted, \\"AC/DC were basically a blues band playing with heavy metal might and R&B restraint. With minimal overdubbing and an attention to raw detail the band achieved a clarity of attack.\\" A record that sounds best when your ears and speakers bleed. From the opener \\"Hells Bells\\" to the final song \\"Rock & Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" it's a heck of a ride... and no filler in between. This is AC/DC at their absolute best. A most essential disc.
6305807086|5.0|As always, I must start off by saying that although the plot concerns a portal that leads into John Malkovich's mind, to say that this is the only idea contained in the movie would be to short change it.  The movie is much more than a clever premise, it is an evaluation of the modern world.   The  film deals with fame, transcendence, sexuality, marriage and psychology,  but never does the movie seem to lose its focus.  No movie in recent times  has quite been able to display the emptiness of the postmodern world in the  way &quot;Malkovich&quot; does, and while all the characters are pathetic  in their own way, neither the script nor Jonze becomes sentimental.   There  are some who will say the film is too weird, but in this case weird is  good.  The modern world is confused and jumbled, to present it without some  form of satire would make it seem bland and banal.  &quot;Malkovich&quot;,  like &quot;Three Kings&quot;, presents reality in the way the  Expressionists and Surrealists presented reality.  It is not reality per  se, but a hightened emotional presentation, a non-reality that leads to  reality. The performances are great, especially that of John Malkovich,  who's role required the most bravery.  He had to satirize himself.  Not  many Hollywood actors are willing to do that. The best film of the decade,  even greater than Pulp Fiction.
B000002UR7|5.0|I was really, really sad with some reviews here. So I decided to &quot;stop whispering&quot; and to start shouting... This is an album that takes a long time to grow on you, but when it does...Let me explain: In the  beginning of 1994, I found this album in a local store. Since then, I was  very curious to hear new bands (I didn't even knew who Radiohead was). At  the moment I heard it, I decided to buy it. I wasn't wrong at all. It  quickly became my favorite album, I used to hear it all the time in my  school days...Some time later, &quot;Creep&quot; became famous and I  thought &quot;Oh, now the world will discover this fantastic band!&quot;  But I was wrong...  All the songs here are extraordinary, though my  favorite ones are &quot;Lurgee&quot;, &quot;Vegetable&quot;,  &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;I can't&quot; and, of course, &quot;Thinking  about you&quot;. I started to play them all the time with my own band and  &quot;Anyone can play guitar&quot; remains as the ideal song to remind us  of that distant age of innocence. Today we're all lawyers, doctors and this  kind of stuff, but &quot;The Pablo Honey Appreciation Society&quot; (that  was the name of the band!)  still takes us on a trip to the past. The  melancholic lyrics, the angst in Thom's voice, the rage full of emotion  that only Jon can take from his guitar, it's all here. Then came &quot;The  bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; (their masterpiece). For my  disappointment, when &quot;The bends&quot; was released nobody gave it the  attention it deserved (this mistake only was corrected after Ok Computer's  huge success). I agree that OK Computer is an historic album, and I  understand that people who became Radiohead's fans after it aren't very  fond of &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, but it's not fault of the album itself.  After so many years, whenever I listen to it (and it happens at least twice  a week) I became more sure of its perfection...Although I love every single  song of the greatest band inthe world, this album is still my favorite...I  have a sugestion: Buy this album as if it was made by another artist. I  hope that it causes you the same emotions it causes me whenever I hear it!  This is definetely the album of my life!<br />P.S. &quot;Creep&quot; is not  the best song here!
6302968135|5.0|Simply the best movie I have ever seen.  I have watched it over 30 times and still enjoy it.  The best image: El Pino (the pine tree).  The most memorable line: &quot;When you expect nothing, and get everything, that's  destiny.&quot;
1573225517|5.0|This book effected me like only a true future classic could. The fusion of the young man's confusion with obsession with pop music and pop culture results in a very authentic feel. This could be a book about me, you, anybody.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Keith Jarrett does it again with a very beautiful sounding solo album.  The mood sounds a lot more relaxed with less full sounding chords - more of a simpler approach which makes it all the more powerfull compared to some  of his other projects.  The melodies just keep lingering along in such a  lovely manner. So glad I didn't miss this one.
9990364516|5.0|I am 19 and I still love this book (as well as all of the Mr.Man collection)! I recently found it amongst some of my old childhood possessions, and it immediately brought a smile to my face! When I was  little, my mother let me pick out new Mr.Man books as rewards for good  behavior- this was quite exciting for me and I always had trouble choosing  which one I wanted the most! I hope kids today still love these books as  much as I did.  Mr.Jelly has a particularly good message for little ones  who are afraid of the dark, mysterious noises,or just about anything,  really. Mr.Jelly is a nervous, jumpy blob who gets frightened at the snap  of a twig.However, while on a walk one day he runs into a kind soul who  used to have the same problem and he gets some good advice. This book has a  great message, absolutely adorable illustrations, and it is sure to become  a warm and fuzzy childhood memory for any kid who cherishes the Mr.Man  books the way I did!
0140288503|5.0|This is one of the best battle books I have ever read.  The level of detail and the writing style is extraordinary. I had great difficulty putting the book down-I recommend this book to anyone interested in  military history.
B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie touched me in so many ways. I am a christian and a major one and I think it's time for us to get a piece of our own medicine. When a person who is a Christian writes a movie about Jews, Jews don't care. They run Hollywood! But when a Christian makes a movie about Christianity people  get so upset and start picketing outside and you know other Religions are  making fun of us because of it. This movie was so well written and so well  directed that it left me in tears when I first read it, as I'm sure it will  to you all. Kevin Smith is an amazing director and deserves all the acclaim  he can get for his work, and anyone who tells you other wise it's just  blind or dumb. Or if they are a critic then they are probably both. Peace  for now, Jon Moody.
B00003CWQ2|4.0|An intriguing, stylish, fresh, original, and sneeringly cynical movie that starts strong, progresses interestingly, and then sloppily unravels into chaos. The same progression can be witnessed in Fincher's last film, The Game, but unfortunately the Game didn't have enough going for it to save it  from it's own goofiness -- Fight Club does. It is an engaging, quirky, and  inspiring movie, and David Fincher brings all of its odd little details  vividly to life. It's also a thought-provoking movie whose shots at our  society are well-aimed, although it's all incredibly hypocritical feeling  coming from Brad Pitt and a mainstream Hollywood production. No? I liked  the film, but people -- particular not-very-cool, alienated young males --  get *way* too excited about it. If Hollywood gives them something  &quot;deep,&quot; they can appreciate it -- especially if it has Brad Pitt,  stylish direction, and a kickin' techno soundtrack to back it up -- but  half of them wouldn't read a volume of Nietzche to save their lives (who,  incidentally, the film owes much to.) I question people who are only  inspired to philosophical thought when it &quot;kicks ass.&quot; <br />It's  not a bad movie. But it's far from a perfect movie, and frankly the last  half-hour is, if entertaining, rather silly. The very end is even sillier,  and after the pseudo-intellectual firepower of the first half of the film  (I don't mean that as a put-down) I was left a bit disappointed. I felt  like the movie, for all of the fascinating ideas it toyed with, didn't  ultimately know quite what it wanted to say. The Marla character feels like  a fifth wheel, and is handled clumsily, suggesting vaguely that either the  writer or director just didn't know what to do with &quot;the woman&quot;  in this film. She's f*cked violently, tossed aside for large chunks of  time, picked on, ordered to &quot;shut up&quot; in the middle of sex, and  then reeled back in at the very end so that she can hold hands with Norton  for the final scene. How sweet. The film's focus is, I think, male  psychology and some of its problems, so you might pass it off like that,  but it just struck me as ... a bit juvenile-feeling, and not serving any  particular intention. <br />But all this is simply in response to the one too  many dorky 20-something guys I've personally seen get *way* too excited  over this film. I'm glad it's striking a chord, and it has a lot of good  things going for it -- I recommend it -- I'm just saying, cool off, and  take this sh*t with a grain of salt.
B00000064E|4.0|This was Nick Drake's first album and is a remarkably accomplished one.  It can be taken on several levels.  A casual listen gives the impression of some nice little songs, low on impact but pleasant - very Easy Listening.   Next to filter through is the wistful dark romanticism of the lyrics, such  as the fatalistic tones of `Time Has Told Me' or the hopeless romantic  singing `Man In A Shed'.  Gradually, depending on which tracks you listen  to, the complexity of the arrangements becomes apparent: `I like the noodly  bits', I thought to myself.  The instruments do not appear to have just  been used `because it's what you do on this type of stuff'.  Indeed, it  rises above fitting into a type; each instrument makes a positive,  discernible contribution to each number, without ever crowding each other  out.  It's most evident in the opening to `Cello Song', most effective  throughout `Three Hours'.  Underlying it all are the string arrangements of  Robert Kirby, giving a marvellous flowing quality to the album.   Recommended for anyone who has grown weary of chart material.
6305750750|2.0|Well like others who miss the orignal star wars I can finally pronounce this one DOV (dead on viewing) it seems like Disney got hold of this one and made it &quot;cuter&quot; sure it trys to appeal to everyone cute  aliens,mystical message and all that but nothing about this could really  hold my attention. George Lucas should follow the yellow brick road not try  to recreate it.
B00000064F|5.0|Nick Drake's second album is probably his best, with a greater variance in the style of the numbers and a greater floating quality to the vocals than the first.  The musical contributions, including a couple from John Cale,  and the arrangements by Robert Kirby are exemplary.<br />This album has three  instrumentals on it, which persuade you into listening for the details and  there is a flirtation with jazz on a couple of tracks including `Poor Boy',  but the best track for me is `One Of These Things First' with its unusual  chord progression, mournful lyrics and floating vocals.  There is even some  optimism on the exquisite `Northern Sky'.  It's not party music and it  won't drown out the noise of your neighbour's dog, but for the thoughtful  listener this is pure gold.
B00000JCB2|4.0|I bought this CD really to listen to something new and so I could see what all the hype was about.  What I heard and learned is that this is a band that has some serious hidden talent, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  their next album, as the song goes, &quot;break something&quot;.  Fred  Durst makes it obvious that he has some problems with his ex, but otherwise  it is a well put together album.
B00000064G|3.0|Nick Drake's final `proper' album is somewhat erratic, his detachment and alienation from the world around him becoming more apparent in this collection of short songs.<br />The guitar and vocal sounds are different from  his early pieces, often a little grating to my ears which prefer the  flowing beauty of his earlier work.  However, `Place To Be' is a remarkable  piece in which the vocals seem somehow to both fit the music and be  detached from it, because they start in an unusual place.  This is quite  deliberate as he is using it to help convey the lyrical theme of being  lost, searching for a place to be.  As is normal with Nick Drake, the  material grows on you and the bluesy `Know' is appealing, but some of this  album doesn't stick so well.  A worthy addition for anyone already with an  appreciation of Nick Drake but not the place to start.
0345404475|4.0|For anyone who has seen the movie first, don't expect to bereading the script.  This book is written with intelligence,curiousity, and most all, originality.  It reads all the way to end asif it were one long sentence ending in a single question mark, much like the title.  The PC game captures the essence of the book much more than movie.  An excellent book for those who think, because this one will make you.
B00003W8NM|5.0|There is a (perhaps growing) element  of macho anarchism that this film explores, much like American History X did in melodramatic form. It is built around a tribal male bonding that can be seen in various densities in the streets of our cities, the bleachers of  sports stadiums, or for that  matter, the offices of the corporate empire which is the ostensible villain  of this fable. Fight Club treats this  world with stylish, comedic  objectivity. The neurotic protagonist(s) display the polarities of cynical  conformity and violent revolt to the petty, fraudulent culture around them.  Something 'real' is found for a time in bareknuckle fisticuffs, a thudding  embrace of physical extremes and provocations to 'civilized' society. But  as these things go, it devolves into outright sabotage and guerilla   warfare. They create a substrata free of  social affectations, or more  accurately replace these with their own. There is a sinister side to this  subculture in the flesh, exemplified in gangsters, hooligans, skinheads and  wall street raiders; but this films treats it all with surreal  satire.<br />Most of the movie takes place in basements, and at night, in the  lost outer regions of the rust belt. This forms an encroaching perimeter as  the jungle retakes the bones of ruined industry, turning its icons of  'progress' into its weapons-- soap out of lyposuction, explosives out of  orange juice and fertilizer. The film is very well acted. The unnamed  narrator's (Ed Norton) cool incomprehension contrasts sympathetically with  the schizophrenic mastermind in the out of control Tyler Durden (Brad  Pitt). Director Fincher never lets the on screen pathos, intrude on the  dark humour though.  Helen Bonham Carter manages to be both a wasted, end  of the tether female gargoyle and deliciously sexy as well. <br />The whole  thing is like an inverted Eden story, innocence of a sort reclaimed,  somewhere beyond rock bottom. It really has to be watched twice to 'get'  some of theambiguous dialogue once all is revealed. The film might have  worked better if it left a little more to imagination. It became cartoonish  in spots where some well placed dramatic irony and understatement might  have sufficed more effectively.  Still, the film evokes a portentous  finality. If the end of days is here, this gothic black comedy has its  number, much more so than any of the year's apocalyptic extravaganzas. The  message is its all around you, seeing it is just a question of attitude.  Despite its flaws-- the invention, cast and generally enjoyable mayhem  deserve  a bonus star, up to 5, especially for this genre.
0385474547|5.0|This book I could not put down.  It reads surprisingly fast for a book involving complex subject matter.  My only regret about it is that schools shove it down students throats and force them to read it, rather than let people read it on their own.  It is great to read a deep and thought  provoking novel about a society plagued by imperialism other than North  America.
6303433766|5.0|Heavenly Creatures is one of the greatest movies ever filmed. Mind, it takes stamina to watch it, but it's well worth it. Peter Jackson (now deservedly directing &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; in New Zealand) put one  of the most remarkable, beautiful, frightening, and tragic love stories on  celluloid with this movie, and should be forever honored. The relationship  between Juliet and Pauline gets handled with joy and exuberance, with a  gradually increasing amount of uneasiness and dread. The handling of  emotions in this movie is a triumph. Those who enjoy a good laugh should  check out his &quot;Dead Alive.&quot;        While this movie is usually  mentioned in articles as &quot;Kate Winslet's first&quot; its main  attraction (without dissing Ms. Winslet at all) is unquestionable Melanie  Lynskey, one of the most talented actresses out there (pretty much my  favorite) and also one of the most unjustly neglected. Don't watch it just  for her, but keep her in mind.
630529142X|1.0|This should not have made so much money. We were robbed. There is no plot and no comedy. Why? Idon't know. Please don't waste your money on this non-anamorphic DVD. The only extra is a trailer and a tiny \\"documentary\\". That's it. I never did expect more from a Disney DVD.<br /><br />The film is barely 90 minutes. Hardly an epic...or even a tv episode.  In fact watch the worst episodes of [[ASIN:B000CELOVI Charles in Charge: The Complete First Season]] instead of watching or buying this utter nonsense. I hate Adam Sandler for this.

B000002TQV|4.0|Great, great album.  &quot;Street Spirit,&quot; &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; and &quot;Bulletproof&quot; are gorgeous, &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;Bones&quot; rock, and &quot;Black Star&quot; just  rules in general.  There are a couple weaker tracks--namely,  &quot;Just,&quot; &quot;My Iron Lung,&quot; and &quot;Planet  Telex&quot;--that keep this from being a 5-star record, but it is still  well worth your money.
1558212698|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone trying to learn western brush lettering.

There are  several warm-ups these really helped me prepare to start writing.<br />Some  flat brush alphabets covered included are Roman &amp; Italic Minuscules as  well as Flourished Italic &amp; Roman Capitals. Pointed brush styles  include Pointed-Brush &amp; Copperplate Scripts. Flourishing is also  shown.<br />Both flat &amp; pointed brush styles have sections on adapting  them for other alphabets.

B00000373U|5.0|I was introduced to Elliott Smith via &quot;Either/Or,&quot; and there could not have been a more dramatic way to be turned on to this man's musical genius. I had to take this CD in little doses at first, because its  brilliance is like staring into an ethereal, intense light that can become  painful if taken in for too long. 1. &quot;Speed Trials&quot; -- You can  just see Elliott hunched over his 4-track in his bedroom late at night,  trying not to wake someone in the next room. Hushed, tense, it sucks you in  completely. 2. &quot;Alameda&quot; -- maybe my favorite Elliott song.  &quot;Nobody broke your heart/You broke your own,&quot; and the way it's  sung, is just crushing. 3. &quot;The Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; --  Unbearably catchy and unbearably sad at the same time.  4. &quot;Say  Yes&quot; -- I wish I could have written this song and sung it to my  girlfriend as a present. A deep, beautifully sung love song without a trace  of cheap sentimentality. 5. &quot;Pictures of Me&quot; -- maybe a little  too dark and pessimistic for some, but the Merseybeat guitars and drums  make this sound like some glorious White Album outtake. 6. &quot;No Name  #5&quot; -- when the &quot;worst&quot; song on an album still makes your  hairs stand on end, you know you've got a classic. 7. &quot;Rose  Parade&quot; -- a tale of alienation set among Portland's annual summer  parade. Simple chords, complex pathos. 8. &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; -- a  quiet, sweet, gorgeous little pop song with shimmering organ and a nifty  chord progression at the end of the 1st verse. 9. &quot;Angeles&quot; --  another stunner, so full of atmosphere and bittersweet longing. A wonderful  song. 10. &quot;Cupid's Trick&quot; -- the rocker. Pretty harsh electric  guitars anchor another great pop tune. 11. &quot;2:45 AM&quot; -- short,  simple, searing. The ascending bassline will ring in your head forever. 12.  &quot;Say Yes&quot; -- the most optimistic, sunny tune Elliott had written  to that point. Smile, it's not so bad. Maybe the most beautiful of an  amazingly beautiful bunch. If you love pop music, you simply must buy this  album. It can very possibly change your life.
B00004S6GL|1.0|That ain't a compliment.  Yeah, he's sensitive, yeah, he's been dumped on.  So what, haven't we all been?  Expanding his vision beyond his navel might help, but I dunno.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Yeah, I gave it 5 stars 'cause the music's fantastic! But, you CD buyers have been duped and gypped!

B00003CXAY|4.0|Koyaanisqatsi is a very moving film consisting of powerful visual images set against the music of Philip Glass.  It is not a movie with a story or a plot, but an art film with a message about the dangers of unheeded progress that ignores the laws of nature.  The word Koyaanisqatsi is from the Hopi Indian language, and means \\"crazy life\\", of \\"life out of balance\\", and Life  Out of Balance is the sub title of this film.<br />The film opens with scenes  of nature filmed in time lapse, then gradually moves into man's world.  The  scenes convey both beauty and ugliness at the same time, and take us to  airports, freeways, skyscrapers, the comings and goings of people,  microscopic views of integrated circuits contrasted with satellite views of  cities, and the eerie ghost town images of the failed Pruit Igoe housing  project.  The film concludes with Hopi prophesies warning us of the dangers  of taking too much from the world, and even of nuclear holocaust.<br />Even if  you disagree with the message of the film, the visual images and the  artistic vision of the film make it well worth seeing.  If you are a fan of  Philip Glass' music, then that is an even more compelling reason to see it.   If you don't like Philip Glass, then watch it with the sound off.  I once  saw this movie with the Philip Glass ensemble performing live at UCLA's  Royce Hall.  It was a very deeply moving experience, and one of the most  profound live performances I have been to.<br />Sadly this beautiful film is  out of print, but it used to be available on VHS, and may still be lurking  in some independent video stores.  If you find it, then rent it, and if you  see this playing in a revival house, then go way out of your way to see it.   This film is not for everyone, but if you have read this far, you will  like the movie, and kick yourself if you miss a chance to see it.   Hopefully it will be released on DVD, as that would be a far better medium  for this film than VHS.  I don't know if it wasever released on LVD, but I  would love to have it if was.
B00002Z88D|3.0|Metallica is in-yer-face binge &amp; purge rock &amp; roll hell. They are awesome LIVE. Now, this is a new &amp; interesting idea to play with a full blown orchestra behind you.... but it just doesn't work for me. Maybe  sooooo many people raved about this that my expectations were huge. It just  didn't do it for me. Some of those crunchy chords belong by themselves -  and not with sweet sounding violins in the background. The two mix on some  songs, but for the most part I was left out in the cold wanting to listen  to their studio stuff.
B000004756|3.0|It sounds like a failsafe recipe for a great CD: take three living legends of guitar and have them make music together. And with those three you cannot go wrong: the technical perfection quotient on this CD goes off the  scale right away. From the very first note it dazzles, it amazes, it is  simply stunning. Every single minute is filled with technical perfection to  the brim, and yet, after a while, it makes you wonder: what happened to the  music? Alas, it got lost somehow among so much world-famous guitar ego  piled up on one small silver disc. It's just too much of a good thing.  After the initial fascination with the razzle-dazzle of so many perfect  sounds coming so quickly, so skillfully, so deftly, so right on pitch, so  in synch, so... (you get the picture), one quickly lets it all fade away into  unobtrusively harmless background music. And good background music it is,  yet it makes me think that creating some elevator music wasn't exactly what  those three virtuosos has in mind when they set out on this project.
6305499365|5.0|I gave this tape away as Christmas presents and bought a copy for myself, as well.<br />First time I saw it, I had hit play on the VCR not knowing this movie (Office Space) was in the machine. (it was my daughter's rental - I'd never heard of it)<br />The opening scene is a traffic jam where an old man  on a walker (beside the roadway) is making more forward progress than Peter  (Ron Livingston) in his little Toyota. You *feel* his pain...<br />That is  how Peter's day begins.<br />From there, we go to problems with &quot;The  Memo&quot; and the cover page for the inter-office report and of course,  some copy machine issues and on and on. (the copy machine does finally get  what it *richly* deserves)<br />The whole scene about &quot;the red  stapler&quot; is just classic comedy. One of the top 10 funniest scenes in  cinematic history.<br />However, the drywall installer (played by Diedrich  Bader) steals the show. Peter asks him &quot;What would you do if somebody  told you 'I think someone has a case of the Mondays?'&quot; to which the  drywaller gives a fair, honest and accurate answer. HILARIOUS!<br />This is  comedy.<br />There are many wordy-dirds throughout the flick, but if you can  get past those, you have a hilarious movie.<br />In our own family, the  classic lines of &quot;Office Space&quot; have become part of our own  vernacular...such as &quot;What's Happening?&quot; and &quot;I was told I  could play my radio...&quot;<br />We *loved* this movie. This is too good to  rent. You'll need your own copy to watch again and again.<br />In summary - it  is intelligent, subtle and thoughtful humor. Looks like it was written by  someone who has quite an understanding of life in the cubicle, because the  whole flick has MANY elements of truth!
0553212737|4.0|This book is well-written for a love story.  The outcome fits the story line perfectly.  Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another.  Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste  of her own medicine.  Her love set ups are not going as she had planned.   Then everything hits her all at once.  I love it!  I would recommend this  book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff.  Jane Austen  did it again.
0345403959|5.0|This book takes you back to a time before the world was ripped assunder by the evil Torak.  This tells you how things happend to lead up to Garion's story.  It is a must read for Eddings fans.  I suggest that you read this after completing the Belgaraid, and the malloreon series.
B000002ULO|4.0|Flaming Pie is Paul McCartney's best &quot;original&quot; work in a number of years, though still maybe a little inconsistent throughout the CD, part of this is due to the wide variety of styles and several producers.  The CD  gives you styles from acoustic to jam session, to songs with orchestration.   <br />The strongest songs on the CD are the ones in the middle.   &quot;Somedays&quot; a touching love song between two people, &quot;Young  Boy&quot; is an enjoying pop song that McCartney seems to come up with each  effort, &quot;Calico Skies&quot; and &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; are easily my  favorites with &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; coming closest to a rocker on the  album.  &quot;Heaven on a Sunday&quot; fits the mood of being alone on a  quiet Sunday afternoon.  The Jam sessions songs, &quot;Used to Be Bad&quot;  and &quot;Really Love You&quot; I'll just take a pass.  &quot; Beautiful  Night&quot; might be a bit of fluff, but I still enjoy it.  &quot;The World  Tonight&quot; started off as an 'acoustic folk-tinged demo', I think I  would have like to hear it in its original version, but the final version  is still gratifying.  <br />Overall, the CD shows that McCartney can still put  out high quality work and is a buy for any Beatle fan.  By the way . . . I  know that you don't purchase a CD for the packaging, but the liner notes  have got to be just about the best I've come across in a regular CD  release.
0670880728|5.0|As you can see, I loved it.<br />The struggles of a (sometimes airhead) single woman are hilarious to read about.  Every day starts off with a list of statistics about Bridget's weight, cigarettes she's smoked, calories  she's consumed, etc.<br />Who hasn't had a smarmy Daniel Cleaver in her  life?  A jerk in the office who strings you along while he's doing some  bimbo on the side?<br />Who hasn't met a man who didn't strike you as  anything special the first time around?<br />Bridget's friends and her parents  (and her parents' friends) are hilarious.<br />Whenever someone asks me for a  good &quot;beach read&quot; recommendation, I suggest Bridget Jones.  Read  it, and be ready for a rollicking good time.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Especially in the face of ST: First Contact, Insurrection comes across as a bitter disappointment. Many of Star Trek's greatest weaknesses shine through all too plainly in this latest rendition. The space battles suffer from the &quot;last-ditch effort that ends up completely annihiliating the  enemies&quot; syndrome, the regulars are far more goofy than warranted, and  the almost hubric human-centric foundation of the show is worse than ever.  (aliens once again look _just_ like humans, and Picard seems shocked when  Worf doesn't know who Gilbert and Sullivan are -- how much does Picard know  of 20th century Klingon satiric operatists? Not that the term &quot;20th  century&quot; isn't in and of itself a human-centric term...). The climax  is unsatisfying and smacks too strongly of the ones in a large portion of  Star Trek episodes. Nothing original, nothing innovative. Just same old,  same old, and that's just not good enough for me anymore.<br />Now that I've  got that out of the way, let me talk about the DVD. The video transfer is  only adequate in this film -- I still see some grain and the colors seem a  bit washed out all throughout, especially in the outdoor scenes. The audio  is mediocre as well, with little punch and a general sense of muting all  through the film. And as far as extras go, the &quot;featurette&quot;  included is a joke -- merely a glorified commercial telling you how great  this movie is.<br />Yeah, go ahead and get it if you're a Star Trek collector,  but I'd caution against it, at least not without a rental first.
B000002LCX|4.0|The last album from the volatile team of Morrissey and Marr.  A very good collection of songs that is highlighted by &quot;Coma&quot; and &quot;Stop me....&quot;  When you consider that this album followed The Queen is  Dead-the best album-you really appreciate how good this group was.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I havent stopped playing it since November.  Yes it is that good.
B0000025VU|5.0|This may be Dylan's best recording, and is certainly his best since &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; The backing by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits is the best Dylan has ever had. Yes, as others have noted here, the  astounding discarded outtakes are better than the somewhat naive (though  still worthy) political songs. But the four tracks that bookend the record  are magnificent, and the overall self-portrait that emerges -- of an artist  who knows his own limitations all too well -- is incredibly moving. And  from the first lines (&quot;Standing on the water, casting your bread/while  the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing&quot;) to the final  desperate cry of &quot;I need you!&quot; the lyrics trace a journey from  bitter self-knowledge moving out into the world and back again, more alone  than ever. Fifteen years ago, an L.A. critic ended his review by saying  &quot;just go buy it,&quot; and that's still the last word. Just buy it.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Kevin Smith is probably the greatest film director to come in recent years.  Like his previous films, Smith relies more on verbal wit than slapstick humor.  Dogma is no exception.  When two angels discover a loophole in Catholic dogma that will allow them to return to heaven, they  embark on a quest to New Jersy.  The problem, if they arrive, they will  negate all of existance by proving God wrong.  Needless to say, this is not  very good.  It's now up to the last Zion, 2 weed smoking 'prophets', the  thirteenth Apostle (played excellently by Chris Rock), and a Muse with  writer's block to stop them.  There are no slackers in this cast, and  although the film does see religion from a skeptics point of view, it takes  Catholic religion very seriously.
B000002JS6|4.0|Brian Johnson had to fill some rather large shoes, but he manages to pull it off. I was the biggest Bon Scott fan, and still am. I never thought Brian would manage to be the Bon we knew and loved. Back in Black captures  that High Voltage attitude, and Mr. Johnson's vocals are to be commended.  The raw, three-chord hard rock we've always loved is in this album. Angus  steals the show, with Malcolm not far behind. The only thing that kept it  from a perfect five stars was the lack of Bon, but if you are a new fan or  have been with them forever, look this one up!
6303148352|3.0|I will admit, Jurassic Park is a great video to watch with the sound system way up, the lights off, and a big screen TV at the ready.  The dinosaurs are quite stunning, and seem almost alive.  However, it pales in comparison to the book.  The movie focuses mainly on the plot of the  dinosaurs escaping and generally creating chaos.  The science is downplayed  in favor of killer dinos chasing people.  How lovely.  The book, on the  other hand, seems much more...well, realistic.  It could almost happen, if  you were to pretend that cloning was more reliable than it is now and that  nearly complete dinosaur DNA was found.  It does go into a lot of detail in  the scientific areas, but not in a boring way.  The dinosaurs are much more  lifelike-the raptors are not out to kill humans, merely on the run and very  hungry, with nothing to eat and a bunch of humans wandering around.  All in  all, if you want a story full of awesome special effects and not much else,  watch the movie.  It's at least worth a rental or two.  If you want to read  a suspenseful and well written story that combines thrill with science (and  learn a bit about the chaos theroy at the same time), read the book.
1559275561|5.0|Below, is a review I wrote about a year ago.  I re read the book over Christmas break this year, and am still astounded at how much it has to say to me as an educator and to my students each year.  We will be working the  book in class this June if anyone would like to stop by!  <br />Last Year: I  don't know if it was the timing of reading it, or the content of the book,  but ZEN is a book that rang with me when I first read it over a decade ago,  and still does every time I pick it up and read it to my AP Calculus  classes. I had to read it 3 times. The first time was for the story of him  and his son, the second as a philosophy primer and the third as a  metaphysics. It was the first time that I ever read a book and really  believed that the author just wanted me to think about what he was writing  and not AGREE with what he was writing. I was allowed to think for myself,  encouraged to think for myself as I read. It is the single most important  book I have ever read in regards to my career as a teacher, and the  messages about how we think and the way we perceive and learn are, I feel,  so important that my classes need to see them and not just hear me talk  about it. Its a tough read.....but so well worth it.
B000002GI0|4.0|Phenomenal writing, guitar playing, and vocal phrasing.  I love this album.  &quot;Drive South&quot; and &quot;Feels Like Rain&quot; give me chills. I'm still humming &quot;Trudy and Dave&quot; and I bought the album  a month ago.  Looking forward to seeing John perform at Indy Jazzfest in  June.
B000002NBY|5.0|This was my first Paul Simon album as solo artist (I had Simon &amp; Garfunkel greatest hits before). His combination of 'regular' pop music and South African rhytms is outstanding. The music just flows through the ears  and mind. It's the incredible African vocalists who you should concentrate  upon. Such music is really their lifestyle (I've heard some African  vocalist groups from Sambia and Chad) and they really know how to bring  life and joy into every song they sing. Paul has added some extra touch to  this singing and the outcome is excellent. Many people identify Paul Simon  with this album and therefore his others (like Negotiations and Love Songs  1971 - 1986) are not accepted that well. This is somehow unfair, because he  is capable of playing many different things, which is not so very common  nowadays. But this album is certainly the best way of getting acquainted  with Paul Simon.
