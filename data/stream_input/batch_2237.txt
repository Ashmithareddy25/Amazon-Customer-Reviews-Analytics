B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game was cool. On my phone the graphics didnt looks so hot but overall i thought it to be a cool game. Of Course all the angry birds are fun and addictive.
B001HC8516|5.0|Logical, funny, practical.<br />Women know better, just when it's not about themselves.<br />The author takes away all the excuses and makes women raise their standards.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I was annoyed they re-released the dvd with special features but i bought it anyways. love this series and im so sad its over.
B006G4F8OW|5.0|Great quality and attention to detail. Because of the great quality and Toei Animation License, I can assume that it is authentic. Packaging was very good.  Fast shipping.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is a great movie.  The screen play and special effects are very convincing,<br />as well as the actors portrayal of their characters.  My only loss is that I don't have a new<br />avatar body !!!!!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love all the twilight soundtracks, but this one is amazing.  I love all the different styles all coming together making a perfect album.
B000H0MKO2|4.0|This movie starts out as a very politically oriented, and business promoting at the cost of human dignity and life,<br />film.  The latter half of the movie, however, improves and actually has a good message.
B000021Y77|5.0|I love this movie.  It is very strange how it plays out absolutely every scenario to this one situation over and over until it finally comes to the end.  It is not in English so if reading subtitles is not your thing, do not buy this.  But if you are cool with foreign films, this is a must have.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I read the books after I watched this movie and I absolutely love that they stuck as closely to the books as they did!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I would rate this higher if the site let me.  I LOVE every single song on this.  I love her voice and I love every lyric.  This is beautiful and she sounds classic.  She is different in a wonderful way.  I mean it is so nice to listen to someone with a beautiful voice singing something original.  AMAZING cd.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good music.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have used yahoo mail on my pc & lap top for years.<br />I also use it on my Kindle Fire. I've never had a problem<br />with yahoo on any of my devices, ever.<br />Plenty of storage space and it's free.<br />I have email addresses on other networks but always<br />use my Yahoo account as my primary account.<br />The only thing I don't like about yahoo on my Kindle<br />Fire is that I can't copy and paste.<br />If I can I sure don't know how too on this device.<br />Any suggestions?
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I ordered this 3 times and got messed up used discs.  I was very upset, but finally got a new one.  AMAZING.  It is consistently good through the entire album.  If you love the songs she released, Love song which is on this cd, and King of anything is also great.  She is very enjoyable.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was interesting. But I think it was a bit slow at times and somewhat of a depressing ending. If there is not going to be a sequal (besides Alien), then the ending is quite flat. It leaves too many questions unanswered.
B00956UPSW|5.0|Get it you won't be disappointed Phil and the gang really deliver classic Down with a new twist. one two.
B000NHPCS0|5.0|LEONARDO IS A EXCELLENT ACTOR.  i LIKE ALL HIS MOVIES  I WOULD CONSIDER THIS MOVIE AN ACTION MOVIE THAT HE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AT HIS PART
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This movie was perfect for my 5 year son and I to watch together, kept us both entertained, very clever/cute :)
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is a great buy at a fifty dollar price point. An everyday watch that you won't worry about damaging.
0525478817|5.0|I knew about 11 pages in that I was reading a masterpiece. Half way through it became one of my favorite books of all time. The writing is so funny, so profound, and so sad. I loved this book. It's now my go to for bday presents because everyone should have the experience of reading &#34;The Fault in our Stars.&#34;
B006RXPTNM|4.0|outstanding movie and acting; I always love Mery Streep and she did not disappoint.  Really thought provoking and great story
B0084TWN9K|3.0|I had been told that Alice Munro was a must read....so I tried....it is good bed time reading....not my cuppa!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|works well. and I didn't need play store to download. samsung galaxy 3. android. great .graphics. henry. good free app
B0002IQJUK|5.0|much to my surprise, a double CD!  His voice is magical, enlightening and calming.  The price was right so winner
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life of Pi was a great book to read. It is a great movie. Ang Lee certainly deserved an Academy Award for the direction of this amazing film. The special effects were delicious. The story has so many facets. Family life. Tragedy. A young boy's religious experiences. A story about truth and what truth is to an individual. I really appreciate being able to rent it and watch it on my Kindle Fire. A visual feast and a great adventure of the soul.
0763644765|5.0|This is a cute book to help introduce potty training to your little one. My toddler loves it and &#34;reads&#34; it to me.
1591843790|4.0|Book arrived a head of schedule and In great condition, and I love the content and message. I'm reading for a second time now. I feel the book was properly priced.  Robert brings a old, but what seems to be forgotten,  idea back to light and I hope this book encourages everyone.
0240815807|5.0|This is one book you won't want to put down.  It is written with the user in mind and yet it is able to convey complex material in an easily digestible format.<br /><br />Everything you need to know to improve your mixes for both the novice and the professional.<br /><br />Really well written!<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and don't even think about it just get it now.
B00B2270P8|5.0|Loved it..great start to the 2 part finale! Wish it could have gone on longer, but good things must come to an end, sadly.
B004GHBQCE|5.0|This is just a great CD. Maybe because it was his last one, but there is a real sence of connection between the listener and the singer with this album.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|After putzing around with keyboards and other sounds in the last 25 years, they are finally returning to their roots - story driven, hard-edged prog rock. Even so, they continue to advance, incorporating orchestral backgrounds in a few of the songs, that add a softer finish to the ballads (yes - I see that as progress - it is &#34;progressive&#34; rock). Yet, all the Rush staples are there - the complex rhythms, thought-provoking intelligent lyrics, signature &#34;Alex&#34; guitars. It is refreshing to continue to see these guys so comfortable with each other and their music after all these years.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Addicting game but fun to play if you just need to pass the time - like at the car dealers for regular maintenance; or waiting for someone at the doctors office.  It great to have on your Kindle.
0425263908|3.0|as a fan of the other original &#34;shades&#34; trilogy which I couldnt put down, I didn't enjoy this one as much. It was a little disappointing and almost too similar to the other series. I lost interest by the end and won't be buying the next book in the series.
1616550414|5.0|Its really an awesome look on the whole series, with so much information that will keep you reading for hours. Plus a cool manga as an extra. The art is just a deluxe dinner for eyes. :D Must have!!!
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Hotel Transylvania has a little bit of everything for the whole family.  It was action packed, funny, and not scary for my eight year old.  It's a great movie the whoel family can enjoy.  I highly recommend it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I gave this five stars because it relates to the show very well. I would recommend this book to everybody that enjoys watching the show. I also recommend for you to reading the rest of the the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book!!! You will be sitting on the edge of your sear the whole time, I can't wait to read the next one!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book number two in the Crossfire series really comes into it's own.  The characters take on more depth, the plot thickens.  I can't wait for book number three.... I've already pre-ordered it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book ever! I couldn't stop reading it.<br />Such a great story, I absolutely loved this book. And that means something because I usually hate reading.
B004UPANAI|5.0|WOlverine is the best Superhero in any comic organization. Movie was amazing, so worth the 2 bucks for a instant video!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|watched with my girls ages 7 and 11 great fun for all of us. definitely worth the price of the rental.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|It puts you In mind of the show. Very fun and dark In some parts. I definitely recommend it. Great read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|look at my friends postings every day with this app.  i like it a lot and am glad that i downloaded it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app really surprised me. I was not expecting much for free. Everything is arranged perfectly. Its great everything sync's between devices.<br /><br />Wish it was easier to download certain versions. Seems you have to be in the right place at the right time to score limited time downloaded.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|A vastly disappointing treatment of what could have been a very good movie.  It didn't even live up to it's advertising.  The best part of the story was the flight sequence, which took only a fraction of the movie.  The rest was mostly spent on the degradation of the characters.  Denzel Washington deserves better material.
B000ICZD5M|4.0|Two things are required to like David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic: 1) You have to already know the story. Mainly because this film just hits the very high highlights.  Zero character development. 2) You have to be at least somewhat familiar with Lynch's quirky, sometimes unsettling style. He's really really big on atmosphere, which is generally highly stylized and unique but is often a bit outré.<br /><br />Many Dune purists hate this film. But I like it for what it is: an avante-garde, Cecil B Demille type treatment of the all-time best selling sci-fi story. Period.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Don't expect anything exciting like Terminator 2 or Batman: Dark Knight in this movie. It is just an average story-telling movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent read. I could not put this book down. This is not your typical romance novel. This book had my heart racing!!!
B001O59AVK|4.0|I just recently got into Enter Shikari and their sound is fairly original imo.  I enjoyed most of the album and it has a fairly high replay value.
B00A4FOWYQ|2.0|Sounds like Wilson Phillips to me. I was expecting something edgier. I guess everyone wants to be a pop star.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Just finished this book. I was prepared by the hype not to like it or the whole Lean In thing, but I think the book's brilliant, and exactly consistent with my observations during a 35 year career (despite my not being a high flyer like Ms. Sandberg). I'm amazed at all the negative comments on Amazon, which appear to be written by people who have not read the book. It does not at all bash men or at-home mothers or women who haven't had the success she has had. It's incredibly well-researched and footnoted. I recommend it for everyone, but particularly my younger friends, because the book's insights will be valuable as they make their way in the world.<br />Highly recommended.
B00000251N|5.0|Many years back I had the 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' LP record which had been misplaced after a couple of address changes (moving homes) and came across the Amazon website and found I could purchase a CD copy and even paid the extra amount to be able to download a copy immediately. Unfortunately there was no warning or indication that it was not possible to download this copy outside of the USA. (I live in Australia).  Received my CD today in the mail - took about 3 weeks to arrive  but now have relived the wonderful memories of that great Neil Diamond recording. Thanks Amazon.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved it.  Great for kids and adults.  Witty, clean, moving, and exciting.  A must see and worth the watch.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I LOVE dragons! The game is awesome! And I am satisfied with every feature! Only one dislike... the gems are VERY high priced.5 stars if they can improve that.
B00865P3AS|4.0|I love this genre of bringing classical instruments into rock music (including David Garrett and even Renee Fleming on occasion).  Overall, I agree with other reviewers who prefer the first album from 2Cellos.  However, I salute their initiative to involve other artists.<br /><br />I don't love every song on this album.  In particular, the number with Naya Rivera, Supermassive Black Hole kind of gets on my nerves.  I think she is talented but there is something definitely missing if you are only listening and not watching.  There are a couple of songs I really love.  Hearing The Book of Love inspired me to get out my Shall We Dance DVD last night.  I really like that song a lot, and I love me some Zucchero.  It's touching and a bit hokey at the same time.  I also thought Lang Lang's piano added elegance and beauty to Clocks.<br /><br />The two guys seem like a lot of fun.  I think they are going to bring us a lot of clever takes on rock songs in the future.  There is really no one else like them on the musical landscape.  More cello!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|It was an okay movie.  The story line was poignant but the movie moved a bit slow making it difficult to keep my attention.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|While I usually love his books this one just lacked something.  It was weak, I read it looking for something easy to get lot in but i actually had a hard time staying connected, lacked backbone. Not his best.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! It has me going crazy. I don't know how kiloo got the idea, but it is awesome. RAWR!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This touching film deserves all of the accolades it has received.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the separation and quality of the music on our home theatre system.  Wow.  I think we're going to have to buy the DVD.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I used different dictionary apps, however I found this one more user friendly. The main advantage is that I can use it every where even without internet access. However for audio pronunciation the user needs internet access.<br /><br />I enjoy the app and recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfer! I just wish that theel iteams weren't so expencive. The also should have more Easter eggs or mystery boxes per round you run. Over all the game gets a 4 star rate from me!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Going to sleep and knowing that when you wake up, you won't have a clue as to who you are, how old you are or where you are. That is how Christine had lived since her\\"accident\\" keeping a journal is the only way she had any idea of who she was, but there are some who don't want her to remember. She starts to have flash backs and realizes she is not safe, nobody is protecting her at all....
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|I beloved this game is really fun but I wish you got more rounds for free or maybe if you connect it go Facebook you should get 5 extra rounds! Also I wish you could collect the candy you earn to buy things like cute outfits for your creater. Over all though this game is really fun! :)
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This could be on TV right now and still be a winner.  You just keep thinking Vic is going to get busted, but he pulls it out.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Entertaining, plenty of violence and sex, and well written.  Jack Reacher an interesting and plausible character. Quite a good read.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson's best! May not be great for kids due to language. I've seen it a few times and like it more each time.
030758836X|5.0|This was a page-turner from the get-go. I tend to lose interest easily if a book doesn't really wow me from the start. This one is definitely satisfying all the way through and was hard to put down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|If u like Temple Run, you'll like this game! Its easy to play & fun to play too!  Good enough for my 6 & 8 year to play during their down time. :)
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a great app for those of us who enjoy match 3 games or any of the jewel apps. It's easy to begin, then slowly steps it up a notch as you gain levels. I had no problems on my kindle fire :)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is mix between greek mytology,roman mythology,and realistic fiction. The story is about children of the greek and roman gods who live among regular people like us. The children of the gods or demigods are uniting to fight an evil goddess and her minions who want destroy the world. The Mark of Athena is a intresting and amazingly written book.I would recommend this book to anyone I know.
6305212112|5.0|i have this movie on VHS and wanted it on DVD, i love this movie and watch it every chance i get.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney films. The storyline is simple enough for kids, but also holds enough humor and plot that adults can not only just bear through, but they can actually enjoy it. It's a sweet story that everyone can relate to and connect with.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a good game, very easy to play. Still waiting for new badges.would recommend to any one who wants to loose an hour or two.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Every song is beautiful.....can hardly wait to listen after leaving work every day.. You can imagine yourself in Italy just listening to his voice...<br /><br />Actually it is a 10 Star  ********* vote by my standards.  But he always amazes me with each new album... and David Foster is the best.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This book took me a little longer.  I was excited to see how Bella and Jacob would get along and if it would come to a fight but NEVER did I see the child coming along, then the Voltri - WOW  it ended so that there is more to come, right?
1582701709|5.0|Let me share you my story. This is very deep and private thing but I'm willing to show you that the secret '' law of attraction'' does exist and its with you whether you like it or not. My Journey that started before and after ''The Secret'' - Ive came from a broken home. My dad left us when i was 2 and completely lose all contact.He beat my mom to the point she was bleeding I remember that because they came back together when I was about 4 and then split forever year after. I used the so called '' Law Of Attraction '' way back when I was just a small kid - without even knowing it. After finding the ''The Secret'' book it amazed me and explained me the basic of what the Law Of attraction was. And As i read the book I was shocked how everything they said and the steps and all I ACTUALLY did BEFORE as a kid without even knowing of the existence of the book, without the book even existing. But anyways making the story short. Ive always felt inside that If id feel good inside and feel hope '' the positivity '' that everything will get better. And it did. Every-time as a small kid I was sitting outside looking at the sky ( when i had a bad day or a problem ) and believed that everything would be great and that I'm living an a awesome life ( even though it wasn't true i believed in it ). And it worked each time. My life slowly was getting better. Even tho I struggled as a kid because we were poor and only with a mom and no outside help. However Id made it thru. So recently ( very shortly before i found about The Secret ) I went to Los Angeles-Hollywood for the first time in my life. Why I'm telling you this. As a small kid living in Poland and living a poor almost average life I always dreamed of going to Los Angeles to the point I believed in it. I said to my self and to everybody I ever met or talked to - '' When i will turn 18 or 19 I would go to Hollywood '' I had no IDEA how this would happen. But I believed even tho I was a poor kid from a small town in Poland! Guess what happened just last year ( 2012 ) I turned 18. After 2 days I received a message on Facebook from my friend saying '' Hey David, We didn't talk for so long. I hope you still remember me. Would you want to come to Los Angeles i moved here recently. My dad has a good job and he has a lot of POINTS on his delta mileage and he said I can invite a friend over for week or so. And i thought of you '' I was shocked. ( little detail i moved to USA first time 2005, then traveled back and fourth Poland-USA till 2009 when i stayed here permanently till this day) so going back to the message. I was shocked. First i thought she was joking. I couldn't believe it. I asked her where exactly do you live in LA and are you for real? she said '' I live on the border of Hollywood and Korea Town. And yes I'm for real'' Of course i said YES ! that I would love to come. And September 21 I had my feet standing on the LAX airport. And when she picked me up she was like '' I will show you something'' and I was ''okay go ahead'' I land in LAX at night. She took me to the Hollywood Hills where the Hollywood sign was, it was this place that was so close to the sign and you could get a ''ticket'' if you'd park your car there or be there. However she took me. My biggest dream was to SEE the Hollywood sign itself. And it happened. ( one small detail i thought it lights up at night but it didn't - anyways My dream become a reality who cares if the sign was or wasn't lighting up at dark.)The thing I really wish and visualized become true. After 2 days my mom called me and she said '' Hey hun, We were talking about stuff with your grandma. And she brought up some stuff about you. We were talking about the thing you told us since you were still a little boy. Remember? You said you'd go to Hollywood at age of 18. Even after you came to USA you were constantly repeating that. And everybody around you made fun of you or said '' Stop dreaming to high '' Yet it happened you're so lucky and I'm happy for you. I'm sorry I didn't believed that It will happen'' At this time I still didn't know about ''The Secret'' Book. I came back to home ( NJ ) after a week being in LA. I wanted to come back to La so bad that I didn't unpack my traveling case fully for a week ! After not a full month my friend and me god very close. Her dad invited me to come there again but for longer. Of course I said yes again! and i went to LA in October and stayed there till December just before Christmas time. And that's when i first got in touch with '' The secret''. My friends dad works at the company that makes music videos etc. I came to his office sometimes he showed me around and all. And i sat on the sofa one of this days that was in his office and i looked at the shelf. And randomly picked up a book without even knowing what is it. Guess what it was '' The Secret'' I never heard of this book before and I didn't know what it was until he told me. It was even sign by Rhoda. Well i asked if i can borrow it. To be honest '' I don't read books because i usually fall a sleep'' And when i opened the book it didn't really interested me ( i red the first page ) although i took it with me to my friend house. And I started to read it. And when i go to the part when they said about the law of attraction and how we attract things, I got shocked. I attracted the trip to LA, Just like I attracted and Ipod, microphone, computer, Iphone,happy family and what i always wanted. I was very confused and scared. I thought back in time when i gave up on things and they became worse ( and I attracted that ) i got very interested in the book ! I read half of it in Hollywood. Although it was my time to come back to NJ. I couldn't take the book. I came home in NJ. And i went to YouTube and then it hit me. I used to watch motivational videos done by the secret - and i had no idea back then the book existed. ( i watched the videos everyday for a year ) I went on amazon and ordered the book just to finish it. I kept reading the book. ( my mom was didn't have any happiness in relationships ) I was sad my dad didn't talk to me and all. And One of those nights just after finishing another chapter of the book i went to sleep. I woke up at 5 in the morning with a thought '' Write a letter to your dad telling him how you feel'' So I did. I didn't even knew his address. I finished the letter and put it in the envelope and also put a Christmas card inside saying '' At least i will be the mature one to show that i care and to take the first step''. later on that day i went on Facebook and found my dad friend account i messaged her asking if she would be able to give me his address. She did give it to me. I sent the letter in the range of 3 days. I waited 3 weeks. Because the letter was going to England where my dad lives. I still continued to read the secret. And everyday by reading little by little I found new tips and new stuff that can help me and I found more about what i didn't know. I used the secret when i was a kid and i didn't even know about it. But anyways. After 3 weeks I got a call. It was my dad. He was apologizing to me and explaining me things crying. I forgive him. I told him to Skype me when he can. So he did the second day. My mom came along and talked to him. Then she told him to buy an iphone so it would easy for him to be in contact with me. He did buy it. ( he didn't have computer and he was using friends laptop the day he Skype me ) so after he got an iphone and Skype on it. We started to talk everyday. Everyday at 3AM i sat in the kitchen with my laptop ( that was 4 weeks ago ) and talked to him. After finishing i went to sleep and when i woke up i continued reading the book. I wished and i wanted my dad to be with my mom again. I didn't know how that's gonna happen but i believed! after a week of talking on Skype with him my mom came along and she sat and said hi to him. They started to talk. Pretty a lot. After couple days he asked her a question if she still loves him. And that's when it started. I don't want to bore you people but let me say since week and a half my mom and dad are on the track on getting back together. They made plans. And shes were going to England to visit him and help him get a visa to come live with us. Mom and dad text each other everyday and they pretty much in love again. I finally finished The secret recently. And it does work. Like I said i used the law of attraction ''the secret'' since i was young and i didn't even know about it until i randomly took that book from my friends dad's office shelve. I could continuously tell you guys how it helped me with other things like Self acceptation and Self esteem. And basically believing in my self. Yes The secret changed my life totally. Specially when I read the book. Because I finally understood That i used this without even having idea of it. Now that i know how it works I apply it even more. I don't want to make this longer although i could give you numerous examples of how it worked. I will just give you one last example that happened YESTERDAY ( 03/11/2013 ) Recently i met someone i fell in love with ( i usually don't fall in love quick ) but in range of 3 weeks I did. Everything was great until week ago when I had a fear thought ( that they will get bored of me and wont text me as much or call me ) and it happened. We talked less and i didn't know why. I couldn't control this negative feeling. Then i remembered it said almost at the end of the book that if you have a question to something ask it and open the book randomly on whatever page it will open and there would the answer be. And i did it. I made the list of the things i like about that person I'm in love with. And only the things i like on the paper. It was yesterday, and after 5 hours when i was about to go to sleep which is like hour before i actually I'm writing this at 4:30 AM 3/13/13 that person called me. Saying I'm sorry if I lately didn't text much, that person became very sweet to me again ( and that's what i wrote on the paper '' I love that ____ is so sweet to me '' and then that person said '' Lately idk what i feel I love you. I really do I want you to be happy and i will make everything to make that happen''. And I teared not only because this was the first time i heard '' I love you from the person but it was another thing i wrote on the paper '' I want ______ to love me and i want them to show me this '' And they did. I know this all sounds like magic or unrealistic thing but that's how life is. The Secret made me understand so much more and made me realize things Ive done and all Ive done was using Law Of Attraction. And it really works you have to believe it with all your heart. I was a poor kid from a broken home from Poland. I ended up in New Jersey, USA. I went to the place I wished of at the age i set the trip to which was Hollywood. I wished my parents to talk and be a full family again, I wished for that person to tell me they love me, and I wished for many things that happened. This really works. I don't expect you all to believe in it but you should. This really works but all you have to do is deeply believe. If you have any questions according to the book message me on DavidCole1702@live.com or See my Personal Private Facebook page where you will see that I have the pictures from the trip and on the date i mentioned and basically all things i just said here : Or contact me on twitter if you feel like:[...] [...]. Feel free to ask any questions you want. And believe in the secret. Because, it can change your life 180 degrees. And it changed mine from poor to the point where i live an amazing place and I have everything i always wanted. Great clothes, being popular, gadgets, Electronics and other. I'm being very honest feel free to visit my Facebook and you will see for yourself. I hope id helped people to make a decision whether to buy it or not. :) A lot of big people said this for a reason '' Dream big no matter how big or impossible to others it seems''. Life is a journey and only you will make it happy. Just buy this book and you'd feel much happier inside. This was the first book I actually read from beginning till the end. Its magical :)

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|So accurate, so easy.  Great professional look and ease of use.  Good for those of us who can't always see the moon because of the cloud coverage.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book it was so real about life for a teenager what problems you face as you go through that life span
0812979702|5.0|I used this book's concepts to go from an 80-85 stroke player to a 71-72 player in one golf season (on the same golf course). Have you ever noticed that most amateurs have a lovely practice swing but lunge at the ball on the golf course? This book teaches you to take your focus away from the ball so you call use your best swing on the course. What I noticed most was that I hit the ball farther and straighter with less effort.<br /><br />This is an essential book for golfers with a fundamentally-sound practice swing who know, without a doubt, that they can't apply that gorgeous swing when swinging at the ball.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This game is really fun and it takes a lot of brain power to figure it out sometimes but I like it a lot and I recommend it to everyone young and old. =)
B000GT6L9Y|3.0|My son enjoyed this movie and it was definitely fun.  A lack of depth, pithy pop-related remarks and poor dialog in places kept it from getting four stars.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I don't usually read books like these, but a friend said it was a &#34;must read&#34; and I must say he was right.Now I  h a  v  e<br />to read all three of his books.  Once started it is  a book that is difficult to put down.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Awesome. What a great story with great action scenes. I can not wait for the next season to come out.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Our son bought this for his dad's birthday our neighbor and friend saw it, played with it and said &#34; Oh I have to have this light&#34;<br />So we bought it for him. He raves about it everytime we see him.It has everything!....even strobe and morse code.We hike a lot out in the wilderniss and it is the best flash light we have ever carried.
B00ARAO720|5.0|Who knew? The characters were quirky, the bad guy you love to hate and all the while it's one fast-paced scene after another. One of the few movies were the cast was perfect together. The bad guy in this was the perfect angst-ridden &#34;Why me?&#34; guy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great trilogy I enjoyed all of the books definite page turner was a different type of love which was different from the other books
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|its ok. thought it would had been better. i would not buy it. kinda sad i wasted 4 bucks to rent it
B007V4530A|4.0|It was simple straight forward yet insightful advice. He broke each method and winning strategy into bite sized pieces.  I would easily recommend this to anyone for any speaking engagement. Every talk should be like Ted!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is an incredible mini series. I didn't like it the first time I saw it because it was much more different than Band of Brothers or the way Band of Brothers was done. I have since fallen in love with it and have watched it more than a few times. I highly recommend to anyone to buy this collection. Thanks to this series I have gotten to know E.B. Sledge and Bob Lechie and John Basilone. I have bought Sledge and Lechies books because of this series and recommend purchasing them both. Buy this product it's more than worth the money you'll spend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just one of the most entertaining books I've read, and I agree to the term of &#34;mommy porn&#34; rolling out there!, it's just so much fun!
0891419195|5.0|I read both this book and Bob Leckies books. I prefer this one over Leckies because it seems much more down to earth than Leckie's. I highly recommend both books though both are well written.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I have read all her books since they came out and I just love them!, they all have message and meaningful teachings and they are a real page turner! Just Love them!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was so well written! Very full character developments and written from both a slaves point of view as well as a white girl/woman. Awesome read!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just one of the most entertaining books I've read, and I agree to the term of &#34;mommy porn&#34; rolling out there!, it's just so much fun!
1594744769|5.0|I am an adult and got this book not realizing it was maybe for young adults, or kids. But it is great! Very creative, it will be a movie soon, I am telling you, read it before it gets made into a movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just one of the most entertaining books I've read, and I agree to the term of &#34;mommy porn&#34; rolling out there!, it's just so much fun!
B0018AM1YY|5.0|Great sound quality and highly nostalgic. Some of Neil Young's best recordings in a single volume. Truly a great bargain!
B006E2W24U|5.0|Glad I was able to get the digital copy, was able to watch on my ipad right a way. thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it and it is the best game ever and I have it for all versions xbox Pc and pe
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This was one of two books I've read recently on this general topic.  In stark contrast to the other book, this is an excellent read - highly recommended.  You'll find yourself taking notes and highlighting the many resources and references cited.  I'm looking forward to getting off the ground with some sort of start-up in the next couple of years after I retire from current job.  To that end, The $100 Startup offers substantive guidance.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Fun, entertaining, intriguing, and a wonderful resurrection story.  The Dark Knight must rise, and he does!  A very fun film.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|I especially loved the bonus cd's. the bbc version of see what a fool i've been definitely covered the cost of this magnificent compilation! demo tracks are included from before they got a recording contract!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter bought this with her birthday money. They were sturdy and beautiful! We were really happy. They are also reusable, so my daughters can move them around as much as they want. Thank you.
B00004TR2G|5.0|My son got this for a gift and he simply loves this soundtrack. I appreciate being able to get the original soundtrack of his favorite movie for him.
B003L77G6A|5.0|We enjoy all of the seasons of this series. The characters are funny and charming. We put this on for our family get togethers. Everyone loves them. Thank you.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great action movie.  Scenes were amazingly photographed.  Craig is one of the best Bonds.  Subtle humor as always adds to the enjoyment.
B00267QOEQ|5.0|We enjoy this kind of goofy comedy, so we ordered this movie with my husband's amazon gift card from my folks. It is still as goofy as ever. Thank you.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I saw PP in concert without knowing he was on American Idol. Was so impressed I bought the CD. Not disappointed!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie two or three times at the drive in theater before it came out on DVD. We still love it. Thank you!
B006PAZMMK|5.0|I like the songs! The sound is clear and it plays on my android phone, my Tablet, and my computer.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I have to say that I have many childhood memories set to the soundtrack of this album, so I am slightly biased to its greatness. This was the first album my family owned on CD, and has had to be replaced several times because it gets played so often. I purchased to add to my personal music library.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|My only complaint is that I wish the playing field was a bit bigger.  My fingers don't swipe that easily.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|The Raven That Refused To Sing (and other stories) is my favorite Steven Wilson solo album yet. The collaboration between Steven Wilson and his amazing band this time around is really what pushed this album over the top, musician-ship and composition wise. The concept of this album is so well done at every angle - through the music, the pictures, the stories, and the powerfully emotional video for the title track. Everything is seamlessly interwoven so that you almost can't imagine one aspect without the others - the artwork fits the music so perfectly. And it almost doesn't need to be said - but the sound on this album is outstanding.<br /><br />Though in my eyes Steven Wilson can do no wrong, this album is beyond my expectations. I happened to be lucky enough to procure the deluxe limited 4 disc, 128 page hardcover book edition of this album- which was worth every penny. The illustrations, the stories, and of course the music on this masterpiece so carefully and thoughtfully put together it spoils you for any other artist's work.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was/is a true American hero. Anyone who speaks negatively about this autobiography should really compare what they have given to their country versus what he gave. Thank you, Chris.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Just a good read without murders they have solve.  Good fun with jokers who thought they lawyers.  Nice book from library in winter haven.
B008JFUN8C|3.0|Somehow, James Franco is not so miscast as most critics say he is. He plays the role of Oz as the liar, cheat, charalaton, scoundrel, and infidel quite well. He comes with the Snidely Whiplash stigma quite complete. It is not difficult to believe he can outdo a bunch of know it all witches even though a strain of cowardness beseeches him in spite of it all. He has the underhandedness to do it, eventually.<br />However, the movie takes it's time in doing it's task. Even the beginning with with a tornado sequence is basically very slow, and even slowly photographed. I saw this movie on it's premiere showing in 3D IMAX, and it is the effects which brings out the real excitement to this movie. Without it, it remains flat and unexhilarating because the 3D effects were, after all, the main attraction. When absent, you can suddenly see the faults of this movie, and you find yourself comparing it constantly to the magical original motion picture that was a gazzillion times more better.<br />Fortunitely, the witches overcome a lot of the material, and it is for that I can recommend this movie, even in it's flattened state. I must get on board the 3D Blu Ray train.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE BINGO.  ALWAYS HAVE SENCE I WAS A KID AND ALWAYS CONTINUE TO PLAY IT WHEN EVER I CAN.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|Super 8 will probably entertain boys 8-12 years old.  Special effects were good.  I got the impression two short stories were put together to create this production.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|THIS GAME IS FUN TO PLAY.  I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME.... ....... .... ... ... ... ... ... ...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Exciting drama!! Very well written! Was surprised to see that most actors have a British accent but you don't know that by watching the series. Love Herschel and Rick .. Cannot wait until the next episode!!!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have seen Le mis several times on broadway And honestly did not have high hopes for the movie. But it blew me away!! Best version of I reamed a dream ever. Loved the little touches that came from the novel. Wonderful!!!
B006903GX8|5.0|I loved the entire series, and this book gave so much detail on all that it took to film without giving any of the basic plots away. Anyone who loved the series would love this book!
B000AMSSAW|1.0|this movie was not conpatiable to my dvd player and now I want my refund..maybe down the road I will order it..<br /><br />thank you
B0009VSB06|5.0|I am very pleased with this item! I am new at metal detecting, so did some research before purchasing. This unit looked good on paper, but you a can't always believe advertisements. But this unit is sturdy and well built, simple to assemble, easy to use....and it works!  I had it operational in no time and was quickly able to locate and discriminate between different types of metal. I am six feet tall, so I especially liked the extra long extension rod.  It allows me to not have to bend over to get the antenna close to the ground.  Also, if there is any confusion about its operation, the accompanying DVD makes everything clear.  If you're a beginner like me, this is a really good buy.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is a movie of my childhood memory. I love arcade machines and I enjoyed watching it. I will recommend to friends who love animation movies.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|If there was only a way to turn off vibration in the game only this would be the best game in the app store.  Her phone vibes tinny and keeps me awake.  Addicting game.
B000002U84|5.0|Great album
0988936402|5.0|This is definitely an excellent opener to a new fantasy series. I was immediately happy to discover that the author wasted no time getting to the interesting stuff. Rather than wading through pages and pages of setup, the author assumes his readers are intelligent enough to make the proper connections, and I appreciated that. Often what bores me with fantasy novels is the way the authors feel the need to over examine every detail of their world, and Roy Huff doesn't do this.<br /><br />I liked the way the normal world and the imagined world were intertwined and thought the  main character was refreshing. Lately I haven't found many fantasy novels with truly likeable characters. I liked that this one was young, energetic and although uncertain, quickly became a good hero. I would think this novel would be of particular interest to the younger crowd, but I don't see a reason why an adult wouldn't enjoy it as well.  I found this to be very good as a whole and would certainly recommend it to others. This looks to be a very promising series.<br /><br />There have been a lot of books where evil waged war with good, but in my opinion, this one pulled it off better than most.
B00000DQSV|5.0|Great album.
B000HZHPSS|5.0|the FINEST of all the trek movies ; plot , intrigue , action , TECH GALOUR , and TWO of Jean Luc Pickard at one time . what a  DETRUCTIVE  MOVIE !! even for CGI , these folks blow up haff a quadrant !!  pertty kool !!  DATA is going to do a SPOCK , and return ... or already did ... that data-port again ...  mind transfer ... yeah , its good trek
B00B7IJBUY|3.0|Having been a Bon Jovi fan for quite a while, I have looked forward to a new release as I have enjoyed the recent past releases of Lost Highway and Have a Nice Day, expecting more of the same.  With the first listen of this album, I would say there is a bit of everything on here.  Some titles that sound familiarly like Bon Jovi, such as What about Now and Because We Can but others that sound more pop'ish or even U2 like, which was not what I expected from Bon Jovi.  Other titles, more ballad sounding and somber than I am use to from Bon Jovi as well.  Bon Jovi songs to me are more rousing raise your hand type rock songs and less melancholy sounding unlike some of the titles on here not that I am against the ballads.  I just think there a few too many.  Overall the album leaves me a bit more disappointed than not.<br /><br />I won't say that this album is bad and maybe the songs on here will grow on me more as I give more listens but I dont think it is as good overall as Have a Nice Day.  This album is average attempt from the band and worth a purchase but not in the league of some of Bon Jovi's more recent albums.  I won't say I dont like this album but I expected a bit more than what this album offers.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|lacks some plot points and get a bit &#34;dumb&#34; and simpleton , however a good continous thread all thru movie and carries the &#34;bourne&#34; thread with excellence .  more GOOD dialogue than previous  &#34;bourne&#34; . we think its bester than ALL the previous &#34;bourne&#34; movies . Renner & Weis work great together and its is fun to watch the little guy win and these two character grow together .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed the 3rd season very much, highly recommend for all.  Photography is excellent and the old time views are done very well.
B000Q79HTC|3.0|plot is schetchy all to often . too many scene switches ; each part has 3-5 differnt jumps to get ONE inch of the thread . a bit disjointed ....  still if like intrigue and great stunts , it is a good popcorn flick
B000VMYCBA|3.0|but the whole movie has FAR TOO MUCH VULGARITY and none of it needed and goes FAR BEYOND normal hollywood trash talk ....  still , phun to watch McLean BLOW UP haff the town to catch a criminal ... again
0792162803|5.0|This movie is a classic and totally funny and just so unique, I just had to have this dvd, great sounds and image quality, worth the money.

1416549447|5.0|It is a very well put together book.  I have been running for many years and this has helped me greatly make the minor adjustments I needed to keep running for many more years.
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|If it wasn't bad enough that the companion app is broken and never gets attention from NYKO I could at least use it with custom button mapping, that was until the battery in my unit failed.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|as a kid I loved this movie, and now my son loves it too. I didn't buy it off amazon but the movie is the cutest thing a live for both girl and boys.
B00BN2CY7G|4.0|I think that people are being overly critical of this album. Is it Slippery When Wet? No, but it's every bit an album that deserves to take it's place on the catalog. Personally I enjoy the more thoughtful side of the new songs. When I was in my 20's and partying to SWW I wanted that album, now I've aged, and matured and I don't mind a glass of wine instead of beer from a keg sometimes. Give it a listen, it's good, quality stuff!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I chose this as an upgrade from my stock Intel CPU cooler and immediately noticed a change. My CPU now runs 10C cooler than it was previously!<br /><br />The fan is a little louder and a bit of a pain to install if you're like me and don't want to remove your motherboard from the case and completely disconnect everything just to install the new cooler. If you're just going to install on a bare motherboard before mounting it in a case, you should be ok!<br /><br />Other than that I love it! Definitely worth the buy if you're a power user or gamer like myself =)

B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app in January and it seems to run fine. Even with the pc and the Xbox being more advanced you still get a great game that will be updated in the future.<br />I'm not sure why they say two kindle fire's can not connect because my friend and I connect all the time and he has the kindle fire and I have the HD. So I rate this game a 4 1/2 because of the updates taking forever to come out. Other than that Minecraft Pocket Edition is the #3 best game on my lost with the pc edition as #1 and the Xbox edition as #2.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was loaned to me via the Kindle Loan service and I read it in one night.  So well written - like watching a mental movie.  Even though the subject matter gets dark there are still funny parts that I chuckled about.  I am usually good at guessing the plot twists but this one had me guessing!  WORTH THE $4!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|He really nailed how you feel unconditional love from a fathers perspective. And the dynamics of a normal family suddenly facing a crisis.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Great movie, enjoyed the bonus where they talk about the man and his take on this movie.  The care they put into making this movie realistic (as much as they were able considering they didn't have CGI and computers back then) is commendable.<br /><br />Cast is superb, there is no one who doesn't do an excellent job in their role.  For the period, you can do no better.  This is our Thanksgiving Day 'Classic to watch' though maybe better for Memorial Day as another reviewer stated.<br /><br />I'm so glad to have it on DVD that I give no complaint as to quality...  Bought the DVD to replace the ancient VHS.<br /><br />Purchasing is a MUST but don't expect anything modern (some funny details if you catch them).  View into the past (granted-it's a movie and visualized through somewhat rose-colored glasses)...
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I did not like it so mutch because it did not make sense at all I just hated it bye
0307454568|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy.  You really have to pay attention though to not miss any important details. but, worth reading.
6304712936|1.0|Love the movie but I can't watch the DVD.  Unfortunately, the DVD came with no sound!  Tried to return it but to no avail.  Will see if I can find the movie elsewhere.  However, if you do get sound - AWESOME flick.
0307949508|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy.  You really need to pay attention while reading so you don't miss important details.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I loved every moment of this film. Glitch really took it from the start. The message in this film is very deep and can actually impact childrens lives in a very positive way. The parents just might have to explain what it's actually all about. It's not simply about a video game character trying to be a \\"Good Guy.\\" I recommend Wreck it Ralph for its fun and its spirit. I Loved it.
0525478817|3.0|I heard this one compared to the Hunger Games books, but I don't feel it was near as action packed as I would have liked.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Good movie. I wasnt a Daniel Craig fan at first but I'm coming around.  This is the best one he has done so far.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Saves notes seperately.  Easy to and quick to use when in a hurry.  I would recommend this for both Kindles and smart phones.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The story was actually pretty good. It was the perfect movie for kids, and for people with the heart of a kid. Being a person that loves video games already, it was funny to get some of the references. All around pretty good!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|if you liked 'Upstairs, Downstairs'  then you'll like Downton Abbey.  Or if you've never seen the series mentioned but,  would like to watch stellar performances including a witty and sharp-tongued Maggie Smith then watch a couple episodes.  You'll be hooked too.
B008MAI0WK|4.0|This book gives you a good introduction of the Pi if you are a neophyte.  I felt at a slight disadvantage because my Pi has not arrived and I couldn't see the details.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It personalizes what it was like to live in Germany during an terrible time in history. Even though it skips around a lot and takes some concentration to keep the timeline straight, it was a book I will always remember.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I highly recommend this movie if you like to laugh!!!  Fat Amy stole and this movie is good for some laughs!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such a fantastic and soul warming story.  This book has it all. Humour, sadness, fear. I would recommend it to anyone.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read a King novel before.  Although it is dense, the story is original and beautifully written.  Mr. King's attention to detail is remarkable.  Furthermore, it is evident that he has spent an inordinate amount of time researching the subject matter.  The only criticism I have is that it is far too long.  It appears to be three books combined into one.  There are definitive breaks where an editor surely could have divided the book creating a series.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love the Ana. She is so much more brave and fiery in this one, but the story drags a bit without Kate there to be her nosey pushy self. Still love Ana's self conscience and inter goddess talking to her.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I have a teenage child.  Reading this book provides a terrifying insight into the challenges and isolation which occur in teens in our society.  If you have a child (or even if you don't), you should read this book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This  is a game  that everybody should  play this game it is  great  game  take it from a gamer  because  thi game not like most  apps it fun and different from the rest of the games
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is terrifying in its ability to show how our future of isolation is being created.  The society's reliance on artificial imagery and isolation is an absolute reality.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|I'm willing to bet that after listening to one of the songs from the album you want to buy all their CDs.

B00064WSN2|5.0|I changed the whole collection of old King Crimson. Now I have a cd's made in USA instead of Chinese hurray!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|When we get bored of our standard cable programs it is nice to be able to browse Amazon's collection and the rental goes right on our Amazon charge. We had been wanting to see this movie so this made it great.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|I love it so much. Pearl of the art rock. after my Chinese cd sounds great. Buy, listen, enjoy !
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I liked the way it was written and filmed. Kept you on your feet. Very puzzling. Good evening at home.

B005LAII80|3.0|GOOD MOVIE. ENJOYED IT. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS. IT CAME IN GOOD CONDITION. DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Terrific adaptation of the book. I saw this in 2-D and it is the only movie that I would reconsider seeing again in 3D.
B00471TLZS|5.0|Not all movies hold their scare value over years, but this one definitely does.  Captured my imagination and scared me again even though I've seen it before!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|All the superlatives are well earned for this continually engrossing series which features an outstanding cast, plot twists and turns against a marvelous setting.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this touching story.  Important this helps me to be kinder and more thoughtful about differences in the future.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Thrill a minute Bond movie but really gets into James Bond's heritage . Bardem is a great villain  and more sympathetic than most.<br />Dame Dench goes out in style.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great installment of The Hunger Games. I once again was enthralled, impressed and highly entertained by the magnificent writing of Ms. Suzanne Collins. She has this amazing ability to write about topics that seem to plague the teenage world, leaving them confused and trying to sort it all out. I absolutely love how she yet again tangles with the themes of sex, love, war, hierarchy, and social class. I highly recommend all ages to read this trilogy, and especially my fifth graders. Excellent book! Now onto book three-the final book of The Hunger Games.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|At best.<br /><br />It's not sufficiently intuitive. It assumes your only source of music will be purchases made from Amazon. It lacks features. It drains the battery and send to be a memory hog.<br /><br />Use it for downloading only and use your favorite music player.
0525953590|3.0|The author takes his readers for a wander across the Universe telling them things most of them know (albeit without his depth of erudition) until finally getting to the Higgs (about which he admits he doesn't know much at all) at the final stages of the book.<br /><br />For me a very disappointing read!!!
B00122K1SQ|4.0|if you're a Prince fan, this is a must-have for your collection.  one of the most popular albums from the 80's, outside of Purple Rain.
B00637HXNG|5.0|The Scorpions have been one of my favorite bands since the 70's. They rock today, and on this vid, just as hard as ever. If you have never been to a Scorpions show, this is the next best thing.. Rock on America and the world with the best German band ever!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series. Has all of the marks of a great show and enough surprises to keep it very riveting. Love!
081297381X|5.0|Really thoughtful assessment of reality by an exceptionally well read and insightful author. One is offered direction in pursuit of additional information. Will cause you to reconsider much of what you take for granted.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|This is a great movie, after I saw it I got on line and purchased it, very fast delivery , very satisfied thanks jeff
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|After having listened to this album several times from beginning to end, I can easily say that this is Bon Jovi's worst album ever.  The best song on the album is \\"Because We Can'.  I'm sure you all have heard it on the radio.  The album is lifeless and slow.  Most of the songs have zero energy and very slow tempos.  I've been listening to Jovi since the beginning.  Love most of their other albums.  I also own all of Richie Sambora's albums, which I enjoy.  But this Jovi album is pure disappointment.  I think this album was an excuse to get back out on the road and start touring again so they could make some money.  EDIT:  Don't be fooled by all the 5 star, one sentence reviews from love struck Bon Jovi fangirls.  They would buy Bon Jovi toilet paper if it were for sale (and give it 5 stars).  This album is so boring and so far from Bon Jovi's rock and roll roots that it's ridiculous.  Pay attention to the more critical reviews.  They are spot on.
0425263908|5.0|I obtained this for a friend who is a fan of Sylvia Day. Having got her similiar books by the same author, she is now hooked and enjoys the way the author writes so birthday gifts are no longer a problem for me.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|After reading the first book, I was dying to read the second. I had read a pretty bad review and almost didn't bother. I am so glad I took the leap and bought it, I thought the authors did a great job describing everything perfectly. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I found myself both captivated and surprised at every turn. I can't wait to start number three. And I do hope the movie resembles the book well.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|A good easy read but predictable. A good modern romance gone wrong. I liked the two main characters very much.
B00BJG7H3M|1.0|Love this show but HATE that they always cheap out on fans by releasing HD only as a download. GIVE US THE BLURAYS YOU CHEAP P_ICKS!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was just so awesome! I haven't seen the movie yet but people told me it was real good. I was told the book was better so I decided to read the book before I watch the movie and I loved this book! My all time favorite so far! I was real hooked I couldn't get enough that its 3:02 am and I'm buying the second book right after writing this review and I'm gonna continue reading all through the night! I highly recommend you read this book it's just real cool and you won't get enough of it either!
0307891372|5.0|My son is using this book everytime he gets stuck in the game. The game guide contains everything you need to know to play the game. My son has thanked me several times for getting it for him.
0062238868|5.0|It is a well written book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  You get to see what are military troups go through.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first I was reluctant to give this the full five star rating because it seemed the control was sacrificed for prettier graphics. But after playing a while I'm sold. A great game.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is the best Mystery/hidden object game I've played yet!  I didn't want it to end and hope there is a sequel!  Story was great, graphics were realistic and fun.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Not what I expected.  Laid out in a refreshing manner and not all just bashing the business. Hopefully every restaurant is not like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting. The only thing I don't like is you have to buy the double coins. But I like the face you can earn FREE coins unlike other games.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Another great season of Game of Thrones.  I truly enjoy this show and it also makes me almost want to get HBO.  I like how the DVDs are arranged as well as the extras.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent. Great read even for a military person! Author was well spoken and detailed enough to keep you engaged without giving up any classified info.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|If you love Bruno and his eclectic taste in variety and sound.. you'll love this album, I HIGHLY recommend you buy this!!
B000025SL5|5.0|I like the way it was composed. Vangelis adds the right score for the movie. I listen to it when reading history.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I've always loved this movie since I first saw it as a kid.  The music is amazing, the story is compelling.  Don't mistake it for a documentary.  It's a dramatization.  Mozart had issues and this is a theme on that truth, but not exactly a biography.  Doesn't matter.  It's a fantastic story.  If this doesn't capture your imagination, you probably don't care for music much.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I got this based on the title.  I was thinking this would be an mix the elements and get a new element type game but I was very wrong.  If  you can remember back to the windows 3.1 days you might remember a game called Pipe Dream.  This is pretty similar to it, except all of the pieces are already there you just have to rearrange them.  I am now getting to the slightly more challenging levels and look forward to getting further along.<br />One thing missing though is a score.  I like to get a score then go back and try to beat it later.  I am very competitive even against myself.  Now I am not talking any openfeint or facebook stuff, just an internal score.  Also I wish there was a way to tell when a book was done from its cover, not make you have to open it.<br />Overall 4 stars though because the game is fun, a level of challenge, but simple enough that my children could play.  Graphics are simple, but good, very appropriate for the game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I happened onto this great book when I read a Wall Street Journal article about Hugh Howey.  I purchased \\"Wool\\" on a whim and was hooked on the first page.  This is a great read and I'm definitely a new fan of Hugh Howey.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this so far...more options for games and ways to earn gems would be nice and More challenging competitions would be better. But like buying and naming the horses
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellant Story. Couldn't put it down. Great humor and a very a wonderful survival story. Makes ya feel like you are there...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|With Relax Melodies Premium, I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep almost all night. I can pick one or more parts to make each night different. There are a lot of different tiles to show different sounds that will last all night. I love the one called &#34;River&#34;. I have a creek that runs by my apartment and when the rain fills it up I can hear it really well through the concrete block walls. It just lulls me to sleep and I sleep so much better.
B003YTPS7O|1.0|Not A Big Russell Crow Fan....but friends convinced me to give him another try!<br />As much as I wanted to like it...the movie draws a rather predictable conclusion during  the 1st ten minutes of the film. I actually fell asleep during the first viewing, but decided to give it another try....I should have followed my instincts!<br />Crowe never convinces me he is anyone other than Crowe.... Perhaps for you Crowe fans hopefully you will enjoy it way more than I could!  :-/
B0063GORYU|4.0|like that it moves the cards automatically but wished it would let you know when there are no more moves to be made
B000WN7NEQ|3.0|Pretty Good albeit predictable!<br /><br />I got this at the instance of a close friend....it' good, NOT great!  Since I've now purchased it...I guess I will see it again!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a book well worth reading. It was very well written and made you feel like you were there. It was from the heart.
B00000K3UU|1.0|An Unfunny Waste of Time. I second everything everybody who gave this a one star said. Boring tedious same waste of time like reading this review :)
B004X2M9VY|5.0|The show keeps getting better and better.  I cannot wait to see what happens in Season 7.  Yay Amy Pond.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I'm not good at writing reviews. In fact this would be my first. What I thought would be a cute, funny, and entertaining filled animation/movie became somewhat of a big old bore. At first I was so excited... I couldn't wait to get home and watch it. So I inserted Hotel Transylvania into my DVD player and waited in anticipation for the laughter and enjoyment to begin. I guess it was about twenty minutes into the, when I found myself, becoming bored. I began to move about the room do this or that. And ended up on my computer playing games online; and the next thing I know the movie is over. (Told you, I'm not good at reviewing as this is my first time)....But after I realized what had happened, I was very disappointed.  This movie just didn't interest me. And if a movie doesn't catch my attention in at least the first 10-20 minutes then to me it's not worth watching. But hey I'm just one person with one opinion. I do however, think it would attract a younger crowd. Say 5-10 year old's. But as for me I it's a big thumbs down!
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I really enjoyed the acting as well as the special effects.<br />Can't wait for the next one.  Much better to see in the comfort of my living room.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|We must become designers to compete in global world.  A must read for the new generation of students getting ready to start college.  We should strive for more Steve Jobs.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like the pace of the game.  If you like any kind of building game you will like this. my grandaughter loves to feed the dinos.  my only complaint is you have to log on with facebook.  yet you can't play it on your computer from facebook.  Because of that I have no friends playing.  would love to see it as a facebook game so my grandsons could play with me.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is the best Civil War picture made as far as I'm concerned.  The narrative follows reality and the heroics and bravery of the men on both sides of the conflict is accurately depicted.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I down loaded this to my cell phone. I played it quite a bit. It was fun. Good way to pass time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was not your usual Grisham.In the middle of the book you thought that you missed something only to be filled in towards the end.It made for some pleasant surprises as the story unfolded
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What kept me reading was the development of your characters. What was expected became the unexpected. Keep up the good work.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I chose the movie first of all because I like Matthew McConaughey, he is an excellent actor and gives a good twist to any movies he is in.  The Title intrigued me:  &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34; what a great title!!  And who would of thought an attorney would have<br />his office in the back of a Lincoln!  Brilliant!<br /><br />  Well written story that moves fast and keeps your interest as you wonder what's going to happen next.  A must see!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This album is chocked full of brilliant lyrics, and fantastic music. From catchy pop/rock songs and gorgeous ballads, to his classic \\"haunting, moody slow songs.\\" It's classic Bowie style. Let's face it, the man has 25 (or 26) studio albums and this is easily in my top 10 already (there are so many good ones, I can't rate it within the top 10 yet) and I've only listened to it five times so far. This is far better than Reality, his last album...which I really like (although not in my top 10). He's in TOP FORM HERE!!! I am also thrilled at the fact that there is 17 songs on this album. This could have easily been two separate albums. What a deal on this price!  I'm already obsessed with most of these tracks.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Yes you hear some familiar music from the others but you hear sone good new ones as well. My particular fav is the misty mountain where richard armitage sings along with fellow dwarves. Too bad too short. Cant wait for next installment
1451620829|3.0|Took a bit to get into it.  There's a LOT of talk about drugs and sex which I know are part of his story.  However, I would've liked to have heard more about the other aspects of his life besides just drugs.  With that said I did in fact enjoy it.  Especially towards the end where it starts getting a little more about what happened aside from the drugs.  It was just a little slow going at the beginning.  But all and all it wasn't too shabby.=)
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Well, it works for pdf files. I am concerned about all the updates that are required for security reasons for this and the flash player.  Adobe needs to do a better job for the user's sanity.  I realize that such a far reaching utility would attract the hacking crowd but it has been around for quite a while.  I would recommend on the condition that the user keep up to date with the latest software.
B007IK44CK|5.0|My husband and I recently watched this movie for a date night from Amazon Prime Instant Videos. We each enjoyed the quality and story-line of the movie. It makes me want to go back a re-watch the older Mission: Impossible movies.
0385349947|3.0|I watched Sheryl Sandberg being interviewed on 60 Minutes. Sheryl is an extraordinarily beautiful, charming irresistible woman, making it very enjoyable to watch the show. She was strongly critical of woman who could succeed in a man's world if only they would set their goals properly, and used her own life's history as proof. Unfortunately, she forgot a major aspect of humanity. One can say that people are computers that program themselves. People decide on whatever goals they want, and then work towards these goals. I resent people telling me what my goals should be.<br /><br />Since Sheryl used her own experience as proof of her thesis, she should have discussed at length her upbringing. Her mother decided to leave her career and spend all her time raising Sheryl and her siblings. Many people feel that if a woman spends her full time raising her family the children will be far better off than if the woman had a career along with help raising the family. Personally, I am certain that Sheryl's success is due to a very large extent to her mother. Many American women agree with Sheryl's mother.<br /><br />Sheryl's failure to properly discuss her mother as evidence contrary to her point may be due to her Harvard training. Harvard originally was a divinity school. The professors were religious people who strongly believed in the material they taught, and did not give proper attention to contrary evidence. As Harvard evolved rejecting religion, they continued with dogmatic beliefs, replacing god with government. Harvard professors teach the idea that strong government is necessary for a good society with a healthy economy, and downplay contradictory evidence. The Harvard idea is that we need to go along with ideas that most people accept. This is very different than [[ASIN:1619490943 Self Reliance]] by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Here are some quotes: \\"imitation is suicide\\", \\"Trust thyself\\", \\"Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.\\" If we honestly examine evidence, we see that Harvard University is wrong. Evidence supports small government. See [[ASIN:0061967556 Coolidge]] by Amity Shlaes.<br /><br />Read [[ASIN:0060936428 The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression]] by Amity Shlaes. A comment on the review stated, \\"Pay particular attention to Shlaes' analysis of the Schechter brothers' confrontation with intellectual thugs associated with Harvard University.\\"<br /><br />It is important that people involved with deciding which university to attend read this book. In the 60 Minutes interview, the interviewer spoke with awe about Sheryl's being a Harvard graduate. Close thinking and reading may bring one to the opposite conclusion. A young person may do far better helping himself and society by avoiding schools like Harvard. For this reason, I give the book 3 stars.<br /><br />In summary, my criticism is the failure to emphasize goals and to examine evidence. We can succeed only by clearly stating our goals. I am a mathematics professor, and stress to students that the first step in solving problems is to clearly state the problem, for only by keeping the goal in focus can we proceed.<br /><br />Why are so many Americans failing to clearly state their goals? See [...]. Rational thinking starts with clearly stated principles, continues with logical deductions, and then examines empirical evidence to possibly modify the principles.niversity is wrong.

B003L77G6K|5.0|I would definitely recommend Big Bang Theory Season 4 to anyone that likes the series already.  It's my opinion that Season 3 was the best season so far, but season 4 is not far behind.  I also recommend purchasing on Blu-Ray instead of DVD as the quality really does make a difference.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I have had this case for over a year now and still love it. True, the elastic band isn't as taut as it was in the beginning, but it still serves it purpose. The case provides protection for my kindle and looks nice too.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The book was well written, which is perhaps the reason I stuck to it even when it got a bit difficult to read.  The hardships it reported made it difficult for me to read in one go - too much emotionally
B00B47NO2O|3.0|There is not an episode without someone dying a violent death. I thought the violence would taper off some but it has not- This is a very chilling and dark show, I don't have the tolerance for this much violence and definitely do not want these images in my head, i will not keep watching. I did give it three stars because it is not predictable and for what it is it is well written, just not my thing.

B009IEXKXI|2.0|It's really just a short novella bulked up with boring and repetitive calculating and description of how things work which is distracting from narrative and character development.
0312020309|4.0|I'm glad that I was able to find this after a number of years out of print, however the cost was rather high for a used book.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|What could have been a really interesting science fiction plot about the Big Questions -- why are we here, who made us, and so forth -- devolves into a lot of slime, gore, and flickering-light-lit fight scenes where it's impossible to tell what's actually going on. The acting is good, and the effects are gorgeous...but neither can save a weak story.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|It's an action filled movie however the story segments just did not flow well from one into the other. It included some big name stars but story wise......crap!!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Having endured all the Carter-era fiascoes, and read each daily screw up, I could really appreciate the replay in this movie.  Well acted and documented. (although, actors playing the wacko Muslims didn't need to act much; just pretend to be idiots).
B005MMYCY6|5.0|Gordon-Levitt is that prototypical hesher from your high school days. If you were in HS in the late 80's through the mid 90's in SoCal then you knew this character. Levitt disappears into this role and makes you laugh out loud with this characters zany anarchist antics. A must see if you were ever into punk, metal, sk8, or sub-culture.

B001IA46DI|5.0|Take That's &#34;The Circus&#34; is simply one of the best albums I've heard in recent memory. They have written all the songs themselves with the help of John Shanks, and while it's more cheery than &#34;Beautiful World&#34; the music is of high quality. It's a pop/rock/comtemporary mix that TT have perfected in the past and will continue to do in the future. Lighter tracks include &#34;Up All Night&#34; &#34;How Did It Come To This&#34; and &#34;Greatest Day&#34; while more somber tunes &#34;The Circus&#34; and &#34;What Is Love&#34; are included as well. Fans will delight in hearing all the boys' voices throughout, most notably a rare Jason solo with &#34;How Did It Come To This&#34;. Overall, &#34;The Circus&#34; will please old fans and new alike, and the tour dvd (&#34;The Circus Live&#34;) a stunning visual complement.<br /><br />This edition includes the CD and a 48 page illustrated booklet of lyrics and rare photos. They have the typical &#34;The Circus&#34; photoshoot photos paired with the lyrics (which look very nice) and in the middle on a different matte paper photos from behind the scenes of writing TC, from note sheets of different songs to personal photos of the boys.<br /><br />It's a steal on Amazon atm - don't fear from ordering from the UK. Mine arrived safe and sound. Can't believe TT are not popular here in the US, but I'll comfort myself with ordering all the TT albums I can! :)

B002MFX27E|5.0|The acting is superb, the story line way cool (who doesn't wish there was a potion that could make you live forever?).  There is nothing I don't like about this movie and I will certainly watch it another 30 times!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The pack easily fits my Nikon D5100, 3 additional lenses, flash, and all my accessories.  It's well padded and comfortable enough for my wife or I to carry on day hikes or just exploring new places.  The adjustability of the compartments is pretty standard fare for this type of case and suited our needs just fine.  2 small external pockets are great for holding extra batteries, filters, a blow brush, or whatever small items you might want quicker access to.<br /><br />The one complaint I have about this bag is that the stitching on the straps that hold the tripod are coming loose.  They simply are not strong and will need to be re-attached.  We have only had a tripod attached during one trip and have doubts as to whether it would hold up under a long hike.  Certainly not a deal breaker on this bag since the price is right, but more of a word of caution to anyone deciding on whether this bag is for them.  If you like to take your tripod with you on hikes or long trips you may either want to look elsewhere or simply get this bag and have the straps stitched down more securely yourself.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Such an easy way to search and read the Bible and see commentaries. Also, the new video feature is excellentL!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Fun movie. Ending is a little less of a climax but still good fun to watch. I would not buy it but I would stream or rent it.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Takes you back in time. The set is so realistic and the acting is outstanding. Remarkably brillant and well done
B00846F1YW|4.0|I enjoy the mysteryville games they have lighted and darkened rooms with a spotlight and a kind of good story.  I would recommend it and rate it 4 stars.
B008D1RCI6|5.0|Actually heard about Bill Fay recently from Jesse Kornbluth's Head Butler and decided to try a couple of his CDs, really great music and lyrics, a real find.
0446693804|5.0|this book is amazing. i love how nicholas sparks writes because he makes his readers imagine everything that they are reading. it is easy to imagine what you are reading and is fast reading. i think it is the best book i have read so far. completely different form the movie. both of them are great but the book is better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Something for everyone--history, romance, fashion, revenge, and war! I don't want to reach the end. I highly recommend the entire series.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|THIS GAVE IS SO FUN TO PLAY AND I LOVE HELLO KITTY.  HOPEFULLY MORE GAMES ARE CREATED. I AM VERY SATISFIED.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game cause its better then the other temple run and I just like this games then the others.<br />(By Courtney)
B00171R00O|5.0|This is a heart warming, very inspiring movie for people of all ages. It will uplift and motivate you to never give up on your dreams.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|If you use the \\"full app\\" - you can pre-set to that BUT the full app is very slow and awkward to use. If you want the Mobile App - which works pretty well, BUT, every time you want to access it, you have to press the Moble App button - not really impressed, but better than the factory installed app version that hasn't been updated for a year and a half that I have had my kindle and at least you can tell the difference betweek this and the outdated version because this one has 2 f's
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I rarely purchase movies, except for my son's movies. I had to get this because I am a huge Nirvana, Foo Fighters and Dave Grohl fan. I really enjoyed watching this documentary and the jam sessions with other great musicians throughout the film made it extra special.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I actually have this application in the cloud in my kindle - BUT - in order to use it, I have to have 2 facebook applications going on. Why you ask? becaue the people who progamed the first generation Kindle Fire put Facebook 1.0 on the device which has NEVER been updated in the year and a half I have had it and you can't remove it - because they were so sure that everybody would just love a 2 or 3 year old version of an application they use every day - GOOD JOB AMAZON - AND THANKS!!!! - How do I know this? the young lady who had no name in their customer service dept just told me, after she had me factory reset the kindle - before she \\"couldn't hear me\\" and hung up on me.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was very excited when I purchased this, the fifth book, but have found it a confusing read. I expected some conclusions to book 4 but have been disappointed. I recognize few of the characters and don't seem to be getting anywhere with the &#34;story line.&#34; I found Bran, Brienne and &#34;the kingslayer&#34; to be very interesting but have no news of them in this book. Tyrion is more likeable but I am not sure where his story will end. The author seems to have a propensity for bumping off his characters in a rather ambivalent manner and so I often have to go back to make sure they are really gone or I expect them to pop up later on. Nothing is tidy or resolved in this book and this may be one I don't finish. After 50+ years of reading and thousands of books, not finishing would be a first for me.<br />Will not purchase another of this series.
B0007XO4XO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loved it and the dvd was in great condition and was delivered quickly. Thanks.
B000001FSU|5.0|helps me relive those confusing teenage years...its awesome! arrived quickly, perfect order - now i need another one since im wearing the new one out already!
0143113100|5.0|brilliant book shows how little we know how the brain can be retrained<br />highly recomment it to every one especial medical students
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read I couldn't put it down,was up all night just so I could finish it.  Can wait to start next part
B000FC1PNE|1.0|Among the four bridgerton series that I red, this is the one I could easily put down. It literally made me yawn. It is until I was at the 2/4 part of the book when the story became interesting, but not as interesting as the other ones

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very well written and I loved the way the story unfolded. Chatacters are very  well developed. One of Nicholas Sparks' best books.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is really funny and the kids really enjoy it. It's a little political in it plot and you can see it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|fun and fast game._<br />need to read directions for play to get full benefit of game.  I like it a lot.!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, it's worth the money that you paid.
0345803493|5.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter, who wanted to read 50 shades of gray again but has already read many times, so I decided to get this for her and she enjoyed it very much.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Clearly anyone who would not give this movie 4 or 5 stars is being way to critical of life in general and has dreams of being the next Siskel or Egbert. Come on and lighten up. This movie was the best screen entertainment I have seen in a long, long time. Hugh Jackman is a garrantee and lived up to expectations. My whole family loved it and laughed and cried through the entire show. The storyline is similar to Sly Stalone in Over The Top but the son Max is not as obnoxious or whiney. I really expected Atom the robot to come to life with a soul of his own but he didn't need to because his soul was portrayed through both father and son. Im so glad I found this movie and highly recommend it. A great feel good family adventure.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Absolutely love this show. Got hooked and watched the first 2 seasons in a weekend. Heard for the longest time that this show wasnt about Zombies. I never believed it, once I watched Episode 1, wife and I were hooked.  Love this show
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a great game for those who like an RPG. You can play multiplayer or go at it solo
1933492953|5.0|This book should be mandatory in design and illustration classes. If you are thinking about working on a project or building a portfolio, put it on hold until you read this book. I guarantee you will go back and revise your project if you have already begun. This is a rare book that examines the thought process of composition and design and relates to psychological aspects which are rarely touched in other school and tutorial curriculum. This book is a great find for those that are serious about education with substance.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a great read. Although I knew the outcome, I was a bit surprised near the end. Would recommend & now to see the film.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|Great music.  Good, symphonic sound, with a nice variety of themes that recall the parts of the movie.  Highly recommended.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Good movie for kids and adults. It wasn't non-stop laughs but it didn't need to be...I can't really think of anything I disliked.
B001DAJZI4|5.0|Tommy is one of the greatest albums ever produced. The Who mastered the flow of the  album while taking the listener through the fine music of the 70's.. This is from a time when bands actually could play instruments.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome. I love the devotional reading plans. The overflow devos are great to read through and enjoy with your kids.
030758836X|5.0|I haven't read a book this hungrily since The HUNGER GAMES. No kidding, i bought the hardcover, the kindle version AND the audio book just so that i could consume it everywhere at every moment. It is exciting, surprising, and thought-provoking to the point of being disturbing. Fun read!!
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I love Denzel Washington moves and although not his best I did enjoy it, A nice addition to my other movies.
0060557818|1.0|I am trying to figure out the secret of Neil Gaiman's considerable success.  Having tried to read two of his books now - I admit not making it anywhere close to the end of this one - it does not appear to lie in his writing, which is cutesy, mediocre, cliched, and predictable once you get a taste of his sensibility.  The best thing about it is the fairly constant flow of impish humor, which is a saving grace to some degree.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Good book, loved reading it but ending is a bit anti-climatic.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves fiction.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  I can't wait for season 4.  Something the entire family can watch together.  Interesting look into the lives of the classes in England.
0062082353|5.0|I Bought this for my boyfriend.  He was very excited to get it.  Im not sure if the pages were suppose to be tattered or not, but he loved it that way.  Book came quickly and at  a great price.
B008OHV5HS|5.0|This CD is great from start to finish! Good lyrics, and great music! This band should be better known. They are clearly a great progressive rock band. If you like Rush, Saga, Dream Theater, Enchant you will love this Cd! Buy it you will be wonderfully surprised at the awesome guitar riffs, good singing, powerful keyboards, bass and drums! This is a &#34;March of Progress&#34; for all die-hard progressive rockers! Best Cd that I have heard in years! Sorry Rush saw you twice last tour and love your new CD, but this CD is something special and I can not stop listening to it! This CD is worth hundreds of dollars that how good it is! Buy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsessed with this game this game is my life... JK but this game is still amazing!!!! So yeah peace
B003L77GG0|5.0|This season wraps the whole series up and there are some some surprises this season you do not expect.I  want say what the surprises are if you have not seen it yet.This was a great family type show ,and every season teaches you something about how tough things can get and to never give up when they do.  mike hopkins
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes. You have to be quick and keep your eyes open. Fast pace colorful graphics and good story line.
6305144176|4.0|I bought this video to show a Vietnam War video not in the American perspective for a Modern Asia history class.  There is no blood and guts, drugs, sex, etc.  There is the F-word though.  The Vietnamese Perspective is a young man (South Vietnamese) who is part of the Viet Cong who is friends with Robin Williams' character.  Williams' asks him why he would do such a thing and he says: My father is dead, my brother is dead, and they wouldn't be dead if the USA wasn't here.  My high school kids need to hear an opposing view.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Who was he BEFORE a late maturing adult male brought up in a world without breaks becoming a man without a roadmap parenting a daughter with out a mom.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Aaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeessssssssoooooooommmmmmmmmmeeeeeeee  Zeus is eeeeeeeepppppppiiiiiccccc atom sucks like dirt  and is a disgrace to Robot kind and a dirt bag also I wish Zeus would do the nuke fist to him  peace out dirt bags
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Imagine a Mario Kart&trade; style game without weapons and you'll get this awesome game!  You go around the island collecting coins trying to get as far as you can without the time running out and passing checkpoints to add time to your clock so you can go further.  You can spend your coins you've picked up on a selection of different buggys, drivers, upgrades and extras. This game with it's outstanding graphics and smooth game play has defiantly made it's way into my top 3 favorite apps.  I highly recommend this game to anyone.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Good family movie with an imaginative twist on video games and their characters!  Fun movie for the whole family to watch that has some meaning to it!  None of us are all bad!
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was the funniest movie I have seen in a really long time.  I would encourage all to watch this video.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|Loved the movie but the book itself has a lot more to offer. Really the digging the Stephen King way of storytelling!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love staying connected with family and friends. On the go or at home it easily accessible I recommend this app for everyone!.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The best series on TV.  You will fall in love with the characters even the ruthless ones.  Can't get enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so people who don't like it gone wit dat mess peace I love love love love love this  //_&quot;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Tragedy and triumph, mystery and suspense will wear out your favorite chair,  make you miss appointments, and call in sick for work. Can hardly wait for season four.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|These are all that I use. They make a good, tight bind to the wire. And the posts seat very snugly in every jack I have used them with. A winner at a fair price.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|The only reason that I did not gave full marks, is because of the final scenes, which i found a bit messy. But that is a complete personnel opinion.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Not only is this an adventure story, cop story, psychological thriller, it is also a stark look at our various quarrels about life and death and the role of law and law enforcement. It's the kind of story which needs a series because it can't be told in one hour.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|An exceptional book that discusses the development of modern cosmology in terms a layman can comprehend.  Anyone interested in the sceintific method and the universe we live it will benefit from it.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Nice watch. Wanted to keep it. I returned it because it was just too small. I consider myself to have small wrists but when I put this watch on, I couldn't help but feel that it looked like a women's watch. Oh well, lesson learned - watches, like shoes, need to be tried on in person.
B007MCTTHY|1.0|To those who knows what this means, I give this a DERP FACE. If you don't know, then learn. So, this game is way too lame. Why? Because they make it seem like it's going to be a n awesome game, or at least a good one. WRONG! Welcome to Lamesville, population, this game. I mean, you get to switch things. Yay (sarcasm).
B00AFEXRME|5.0|After having seen numerous commercials regarding this new movie by Denzel Washington plus the special effects I decided to rent this movie from another source, found it to be a great movie with superb special effects and decided to buy it.
B007704HO6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Bob proved to be a wonderful companion both on and off the street.<br />It also gave me a greater insight into busking and buskers.<br />Long may James and Bob continue to enthrall and bring a spark of light to Londoners and tourists alike.<br /><br />Thyme
B003L77G8I|4.0|I purchased this season of Bones, as I enjoy watching the episodes more than once and enjoy letting my guests and visitors select them for their viewing pleasure.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci is a master in Zero Day. John Puller is a master army investigator cut from a different bolt of cloth. Don't miss the ending!
B001NLL8LA|3.0|same 'ol. but what i want to know, if this book was written in 2008 or whenever it was, why is this supposed hero so clueless and breathless about electronics?  all the descriptions of hard drives working etc? places this around 1995 at most, overrides the supposed purpose and makes him seem like an old fool (and i am older than he's supposed to be.)  annoying and counterproductive.  otherwise? same 'ol...
1419701533|5.0|My son loves this!  Bought it for him as a gift, and he cannot put them down!!!  Great gift for my 6 year old reader!!!
B009VMN3RA|2.0|Horrible parents but too much information shared by Sachi about her sex life<br /> Rejoice in your family and put all this behind you .
B004OA6KIS|5.0|As always Mr. Feynman delivers, in this follow up. I am particularly struck by his personal letters and thoughts of his first love, as well as his torment during the shuttle commission. His words come through just as energetic as you'd expect, all in all, a great (albeit shorter) read.
0375842209|5.0|No need to repeat the synopsis in the book description, which covers it well. I'll just add that this story is beautiful, sublime, tragic, humorous, and sweet all at the same time, with unforgettable characters. It should be a classic fictional favorite along titles such a To Kill a Mockingbird, Anna Karenina, Frankenstein, and All the King's Men (I know, and eclectic list, but this book is unique too). Simple as the prose may be, the story is just so full of heart and wisdom, and creatively told by Death. I borrowed this book from the library, but then had to buy one for myself because I would read it again.
B000GOY3I0|4.0|My kids like this movie because of all the fun things Richie has and can do. My husband and I think that stuff is fun, too, but really like the message the movie delivers: You can have everything but not really be rich unless you have friends.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators got a bit slow in the middle, but all in all was an enjoyable read. I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's a lot of fun. the kids are having some trouble with the controls, but it's great. Will keep you entertained for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great It keeps me on edge and awake at night can't stop playing. my husband is going to leave me
B005USZYDU|5.0|The entirety of the story is refreshing and inspiring. Is there really a person in real life that this is based on?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book and the description of all the characters was great. Even the dog was a main stream character!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is a great book it is neave reckning and a page turner He keeps you on egde can't stop reading
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I really liked this book as well as the two that followed it.<br /><br />Great drama and mystery!<br /><br />I hope the series continues.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This original series from Fox is an unusual premise with a cast and writing that pulls it all together masterfully.  I wasn't aware of it when first released and having the opportunity to rip through this first season without having to wait a week between episodes was a real treat.If you like the paranormal or programming that constantly surprises, this series is definitely for you. How else could one describe strange ailments used as weapons, time travel and Fringe's own version of \\"men in black\\" (with a twist), The Fringe is definitely your type of show if you like the odd and bizarre!!
B005USZML4|5.0|This novel was great. I was conjuring up all kinds of scenarios based on the clues. Grisham took me in several directions and it was worth the read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|couldn't stop watching.easy access to viewing show..characters are so interesting as is the time period..love it!..can't wait for season 3
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham continues to thrill me.<br /><br />His writing style may be predictable but his theme threads and outcomes are still keeping me on edge.<br /><br />I recommend Racketeer as an easy read that keeps you interested throughout the book.
B008MEM24S|1.0|this is bull crap I HATE the stupid show now they go and make a stupid app DO NOT waste your money on this
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If one year ago someone would have said, &#34;you are going to read a cookbook and, more importantly, it is going to make you realize that life is awesome&#34;, I would have just smiled, nodded, and looked for something else to do. The fact is, this cookbook does give some perspective on food, and how to better treat oneself, and how to enjoy those things better. After reading this book, I am empowered and confident in a new area of study which will affect me for the rest of my life. I heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to cook better (or at all) or anyone looking for some guidance in life. I felt inspired every time I started reading.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|fun and simple. Don't except major actoring skills, this is all about action. Slow at times, but generally an ok flick -
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing, moving, absolutely great a definite read, great for teen kid, especially ones that nee! Someone to talk to<br />The
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I appreciate apps likes these because it helps me to be even closer with God, and having more light and positive energy through seeing and understanding the words in this app.  I need that in my life its great for the soul and mind.
0451232852|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. I gave him the second book in the trilogy for Christmas. I needed the first book first. We were very pleased at the speed it arrived so he could get lost in the story.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Great game, a little hard to move in the game, the song is kind of depressing and the tone of the game gives awareness to what can or does really happen in the oceans when toxic wastes enters into the ocean. Its a snippet of reality meets playtime. Its a type of enviromentalist game as well.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's an awesome game to play great on kindle fire HD.Great time killer.Great graphics and sound.Love the game.nice for travel
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved this game but it kept crashing and I had to delete my app from my Kindle. But this game is so much fun and its a chance to be competetive with others, for higher scores. I love the graphics and the goals you have to accomplish in the game.
1451696191|5.0|the shipment was way faster than expected, and the quality of the prodduct is great. i strongly recommend it, you want regreat it
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game is challenging and fun but its a definite challenge and the challenges are great but this game is just too tough to pass after a while. Really fun though and I reccommend it for any age.
B0071U5HFK|5.0|It is not surprising that Lenovo created this awesome mouse.  It is small and cool, just what I wanted. The quality is perfect. It works excellent with my Thinkpad x220. I am running Linux as OS, just plug and play.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I appreciate apps likes these because it helps me to be even closer with my emotions and thoughts,  I need that in my life its great for the soul and mind.
B00280LYHS|5.0|That was amazing I love how Clarisse said finally and I totally agree with her I think I am Anabeth cause we are so a like I love architecture and want to be an architect love learning and most of all I am so in love with Percy.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|No...crashed didnt work and I couldnt play it, therfore it could not be fairly rated because I never got a chance to play it.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I got this for me. I have always loved this movie and wanted to wait until I could get it for a good price!  Got it!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I remember going to the movie, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, and enjoyed the music more than the storyline.  It was impossible to sit still with the Bee Gees music  accompanying the dance moves of John Travolta.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was something my kids have wanted and I got such a good price for it!  Best gift for them!
B002SR3T10|5.0|I LOVE this album.<br />As others have said, you need not be a Jethro Tull fan to enjoy this, but if you're already a fan, I think you'll love it.<br />It takes some of the traditional carols we know and revamps them into some really cool arrangements.<br />My favorite is God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman. I can just listen to it over and over, which I do. It doesn't have to be Christmas time to enjoy this CD.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I watched this movie a few years ago for the first time loved it but the DVD wasn't mine but a friend's so I kept looking for it but never found it for a good price I found it on amazon which was available for rental nd streamed it on my TV on HD I loved it!
B008XKT9FG|4.0|Many twists and turns. A movie that keeps you guessing. Reccommend it. Great entertainment for a cold rainy afternoon by the fire.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fun & entertaining, high action and lovable crew! 14 episodes were not enough even with the final &#34;Serenity!! Wish that &#34;Firefly&#34; was still making episodes!!!
1478230096|3.0|It's what I wanted, but the poor (sloppy) formatting is a distraction for me, since I am an old tech writer, and was very particular about my punctuation and format.
B007MCTTHY|2.0|I have never played this game before I hope it is fun because I don't have that much room on my kindle left
B0042MEQVG|1.0|I ordered for Christmas presents, then we had illnesses in family, so only recently opened and guess what - the DVD was broken from the center hold to about 1-1/2&#34; down.  Of course, could not return (30 day policy), so I ordered another copy.  Learned a valuable lesson - even if for present - OPEN IT, INSPECT thoroughly, THEN wrap - don't wait!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The idea and the story is compelling but it could have been edited down a couple hundred pages. Seems that most of the books that Stephen King writes these day are mega reads that are eight hundred to a thousand pages long. Other than that it was a thought provoking book. If you could go back in time and change history to better the future what would you do? How it changes the future may not be what you expect and the ramifications could be worse than if you hadn't.
B002ZG997C|5.0|If you have never seen this movie - it's a MUST SEE!  Denzel Washington does a wonderful job protraying this character.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|\\"Safe Haven\\" was a great book! It was suspenseful and romantic! I liked how Nicolas Sparks wrote each chapter in a different character's point of view. I also saw the movie and it was also really good but it was changed some. \\"Safe Haven\\" is definitely one of the best books I ever read!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|The Twilight Saga series might not be for everyone but I sure have enjoyed the ones I've watched so far.  Ordered all of them, will continue as soon as &#34;Eclipse&#34; comes in - ordered for Christmas, never opened it, then just recently opened (had family illnesses going on) and the DVD was broken.  Too late to return, so I've ordered a replacement.  Love the fantasy, great photography and acting also!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I eagerly awaited the second part of the century trilogy but was very disappointed.  The book's emphasis is heavily on the characters in a soap-opera way and lacks historical depth and information.  \\"Fall of Giants\\", by comparison, provides substantial historical background, making it a more interesting and informative novel.  Maybe the final installment will be more like the first.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Absolutely one of the most beautiful movies based on a true story.  Every family should watch this together!  It will certainly make one stop and count our blessings.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|A GREAT STORY AND WAS WELL TOLD. GOOD REALISM. WELL CHOSIN ACTORS. CHASING MAVERICKS IS VERY MEMORABLE AND HEART WARMING.
1451695195|1.0|Full of itself, repetitive, boring, lack of scientific anything, babble<br /><br />That was 10 words and now I am at 20
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|my daughter just loves this movie she will watch all day if I let her I would recommend this movie for anyone with kids
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Similar to games like bejeweled, where you swap symbols to match three or more, this game is entertaining to kill time and test your speed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u are a girl like me,  you will love it. Plz get it! It is definitely worth the 7 bucks!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I found albums here I can't find in stores, even one that is discontinued! Plus the cloud is great too,
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I've seen other versions, but this is my favorite! I think the actors in this movie fit the characters in the book almost perfectly. I don't like that they left out some of Bertha's scenes; they left out some major things, but you can't fit everything into one movie. I would definitely recommend this version in particular to a friend.
B00498YZFK|3.0|ok, it's an indie film which I didn't know going into it. Knowing that now makes a bit of my criticism more understandable; a few shots seemed really amateurish and didn't flow well. Director's fault?<br />The biggest thing that really stuck out to me was that NONE of the characters ever smiled, laughed, or showed any emotion other than fear, etc. Not even a maniacal laugh? Nope. I guess I blame the author for this one. Talk about one-dimensional and unrealistic characters. No community anywhere regardless of circumstances is this morose. Just really took me out of the picture.<br />Jennifer Lawrence was awesome though.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|got this movie for my son one day when it snowed and he didnt have school.  by the time i got home from work he had watched it 3 times and loved it.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Reminded me of a bad B movie. Not at all what i was expecting. Hard to follow the story line.
B009FZFONO|5.0|this is one of the best episodes of the season. unfortanly you wait until the last 7 min for action
B005EGXNLS|4.0|I love the Utred series, and this one in particular has some really funny parts.  I highly recommend this series, but there were a couple issues nagging me this time.  The series is getting a little formulaic, and it is time to wrap it up in the next couple of books.  Cornwell - If you read this - fewer names that start with Ae please.  They get confusing when it has been several months since reading the previous book.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|[...] is much better than this garbage app. i dont like it at all and i am very dissapointed that facebook allowed it to be created.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very good story line. Hard to put the books down.<br /><br />Happy to have buy the kindle version and be able to read across multiple devices (with sync).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very absorbing  Once you watch the first season you're hooked.  Can't wait for season 4.<br />Wonderful look at a time in history.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of mine and my kids favorite games! Wish there was more obstacles to do but over all fun game!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Outstanding! Loved every minute of it. Riveting. Very real to life about the struggle to admit alcoholism. More about the personal internal struggle than about a plane crash which was fine with me. But the title to the movie might be confusing to some.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Book is well written. Hope anyone reading this book is in an abusive relationship will have the courage that Erin had, and whatever it takes get away. My favorite character Carley Jo
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|The moving was touching, heartfelt & humorous. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Highly recommend this movie! Had some inappropriate language, so beware in case of younger viewers, but due to the subtitle, didn't seem as offensive. Must see!
B000WGWQG8|4.0|This is a great show on John Adams.  Well done by HBO.  Could have done without the sex scene.  We civilized society prefer not to experience what goes on behind closed doors.  That is why it is a private act so nobody else can experience that, but the two.
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|Good story, bad acting.  I mean absolutely terrible acting, worst of all the &#34;Avengers&#34; series of movies.  Probably should watch it if you want to know some backstory for The Avengers, but that's the only reason.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie. The book must be better!! I will! read it at the end of the semester since I have the summer off
B003O86FMW|5.0|The awesome second book in the series. These books have a cruel reality but also justice in the end. A must to read.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great story about a man so humble, and being true to his life's path. His first album did not succeed because there was basically no radio play, concerts, or promotions of Rodriguez. He did not curl up and die, but did honest hard work in construction and demolition before being re-discovered some decades later. Even having great success later on in life, Rodriguez still remains humble, living for forty years in the same house in Detroit, and giving away most of his money to family and friends. A must see documentary.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|When I first bought this regular DVD in 2007, I had no idea the enjoyment I was about to get.  Now, some six years later, this is still among my favorite all-time concert DVD.  And I've waited all these years for it to be released on Blue-ray so that I could buy it again. I'm looking forward to it's arrival in the next couple of days. Thank you Eagles for recording this performance for all-time.  You are truly an &#34;American Band&#34; that kicks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book.  You couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and hope for the best for them.
B00846REIS|2.0|Unlike Bared to You, I kind of liked 50 Shades. At least I was impacted by the profoundness of the damage wrought to the psyches of the characters that was well developed in the book. In 50 Shades it was not the crazy sex stuff- but rather, of the impact of child abuse, that kept my interest as I followed the author into her ideas of the impact of sexual abuse of children and adolescents and the power schema implied therein. That was an appealing subplot to the story line that I could wrap my mind around in 50 Shades (BTW, I should note that I did not have the impression Bared to You was a wanna be 50 Shades of Grey as many reviewers have implied, rather I thought it more of a marketing attempt to capture on wild, heretofore unexplored, slightly pornographic sex writing targeted to suburban women). Anyway, in Bared to You, I was looking for something to grab onto because I wanted to have an actual story- not just loose compilations of extraordinarily titilating sex scenes. I started out really liking Eva's character because I liked her sassiness and her sense of humor. I wanted to become friends with Eva and Cary and Gideon. However, I found they were so one-dimensional I couldn't find endearing qualities that humanized them for me. Just dysfunctional sex hounds- all of them. At the end of this book- I still don't even know what Gideon does for a living. He's worth $12 billion... doing what exactly? Owning pieces of controlling interests of other people's companies? Not very feasible. Seriously? The book in its entirety is kind of insulting to my intelligence. I like a good romance just the next girl, but I have to have something to go with the sex or it's just porn with no story. I'm bummed I shelled out the $10 for this as I thought it was subpar.<br />Please! Authors across the land: If you want to give us a huge helping of sex, can you please put it into the context of an interesting story? Please?
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I watched this movie with my family at home. It's nice and very inpiring. Good quality of the DVD as well.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Wake up playing---go to sleep playing.  Love it.  All ages can play it.  Love visiting other places to see what they have created.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|For me is not the best movie of the saga. I have all the movies and my favorities are the first one and the last one! I love the battle!!!  Is better than the book...
B00AESN8XY|4.0|At first it was a dementedly fun game but after a few levels it starts to get nearly impossible to win. getting DNA points gets increasingly harder and it just stops being fun after a few failed attempts. The wait for everyone to get infected ruined it for me and cost it a star.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|The animation was incredibly lifelike and detailed. Loved the chase scenes. Daniel Craig was deliciously evil. I recommend it highly.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I've had and heard better mics, but not at &#60;$50. If you're looking for a decent lav on a budget, you can't go wrong.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Hard not to watch in sequence,charming witty and seemingly appropriate. Somewhat excessively romanced by moments but still greatly appreciated. Needed an extra word,ended up writing eight.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Moved along nicely. Somewhat predictable but had good interaction. Characters were believable and the plot had several good twists to add to the excitement.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I would definitely read the book first, but ... if you liked the book, seeing the story brought to life is great.  There are minor inconsistencies, as any book brought to Hollywood acquires, but ... I still thought it was a great story that anyone who's loathed the high school battlefield can relate to.  Enjoy :)
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The movie was shippped super fast and was well packaged. Very cute movie for all ages!!! I have watched it four times in the past week!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Fascinating story of coping with challenge.  Story for women of all ages.  It is dumb to require me to use a minimum number of words.
0316187216|4.0|The stand-alone novel \\"Red Country\\" returns to the world the author created for the \\"First Law\\" trilogy after \\"[[ASIN:0316044989 The Heroes]]\\".  Similar to prior books, new characters interact with pre-existing characters in a style not unlike a western theme.  Essentially a straightforward action-laced plot involving flawed individuals struggling with their troubles with no political maneuvering or large scale battles.<br /><br />A burned down farm and stolen children force Shy South and her \\"father\\" Lamb to pursue the villains across the country while Nicomo Cosca mercenaries his way following his greedy ways after hearing rumor of a vast treasure.  Meanwhile Temple, the lawyer for the Company of the Gracious Hand, bounces back and forth between the two separate groups.  The majority of the storyline follows Shy and Temple, two interesting characters of varied background.  Lamb, well, if any reader has enjoyed some of the classic Abercrombie characters then it will be a great treat after the last couple books with Caul Shivers, who still briefly appears.<br /><br />A comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I recommend the novel to any fan either of the author or the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a great movie. It came quickly.  I purchased at a great low price.  I love the pre-order option.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I was not prepared to like this book!  Judging purely from the title, I thought the odds were pretty good that I would be disappointed.  Quite the contrary.  This book is refreshing, clever, well written, funny, poignant, whimsical....a  pure delight.  The life of &#34;Allen&#34; as a young man and old, is a fantastic journey over his 100+ years.  The author has brilliantly constructed this novel; it never disappoints.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|ITS OK I LOVE HORSES AS SO THIS IS THE FUN WITHOUT THE EXPENSE AND WHEN I HAVE THE TIME
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Movie was good, great actors, script and conclusion.<br /><br />Con:<br />The streaming of the move stopped right at the climax, had to reload and restart, this isn't the first time, not sure why it happens right at the &#34;world is going to end&#34; part...
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|I'm not a die hard Zeppelin fan and sometimes live albums can be disappointing but when this was on sale for the $2.99 download I thought why not?  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The live recording is very good quality and the whole concert just flows.  If you don't have any or much Zeppelin, this is a great album to add to your collection.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Bond movies to me mean action, romance, loss, one-liners, certainty in his character, brainy....<br /><br />This one didn't really make it. The story seemed too much like M was Bond's mom. I never really got to like M all that much in the series so I wasn't really interested in her character. I liked the new Q and would have liked to see more of his character.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a good Bond but in this film, they played him off like the old man who can barely hold it together or who can't measure up. I want Bond to be smarter than the average person and over the top in skill. Maybe I expect too much from Bond but that's my opinion.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I have spent more on this game than the 3$$ angry birds itself. ive hired a mechanic twice (1.99&times;2 =4.00) and got the field of dreams (another 2.99!!).<br />BUT YES IT IS A FUN GAME! :) JUST DON'T LET IT TAKE UR MONEY!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|The show is great but it will not play on my computer. It took 3 hours to watch a one hr show beacsue it stopped so many times. I am hopin g to get my money back if it is possible. I never knew it would be almost unplayable due to my laptop. Thank you so much.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is a GEM! The study notes are phenomenal in my opinion. They are very similar in style to those of the Life Application Study Bibles, but more written in a Study Bible like context of historical information, or breaking down the passages for further understanding, with a WHOLE lot less of the &#34;Go check out the study note in this book / verse, and jump around a bunch&#34; style like the NIV Study Bible and a few others. The introductions for each book are great, and really give you an idea of whats going on, such as the author, time frame, and outlines of that book. The maps and illustrations are very detailed. Especially the drawings of the Tabernacle, Ark of the Covenant, and other important items that require a visual element to fully draw into the word and the time in which the events happened.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Love the fact that it was another page turner from beginning to end. Her way of bringing the reader into the love, life, and pain of the character is matched by very few. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it let we missed the end of one of the characters you get to know and you lose the ability to feel the entire loss. Other than that another great story of love and life with some really great advice to live by.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|one of the top 5 purchases of my life.I watch it over and over and over,and still can't believe some of the stuff he does.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Joss Whedon directs a strong cast with great chemistry in an action film with banter out of a Tracy and Hepburn film (Downey and Paltrow), STRONG female characters (Downey, Scarlett Johansson, and Cobie Smulders), a complex narrative of good v. evil and right v. wrong, great comic timing--oh--and lots of scary bad guys and explosions.  This film is the real deal.  Not Hamlet or Death of a salesman.  (that's why I give it only 4 stars).  But an almost perfect comedy. Ranks up there with Live free or Die Hard.
0307279189|5.0|A fabulous story, reads like fiction, and makes you question a lot of modern underpinnings of running philosophy.<br />Made me run for fun again.
B0041KVXLK|2.0|The Beatles have gotten so much praise over the years of being one,if not the greatest band ever,and in NO WAY do they deserve that much credit.What made THEM so great??They didin't sound ANY better then anybody else that was out during that time.The Beatles were just a mediocre band at best.There were so many other bands,that were a million times better then The Beatles ever were,and those bands were overlooked,because everybody's attention were on The Beatles.I also wanna point out that The Beatles were Satanists,and very much admired the teachings of Aleister Crowley...An evil,child molesting,perverted,drug addicted maniac.Don't believe me?Take a REAL good look at the album cover.Look in the upper left hand corner.You will see their lovely \\"hero\\" Aleister Crowley's picture.The Beatles even said that they wanted their heroes on this album cover.The Beatles were talented,but nowhere near as great as people make them out to be,and their obession with Crowley's wicked teachings,make me like them even less.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This movie makes ballerinas look bad. I bought this thinking the movie was really about dance, but I was terribly wrong. I would recommend no one see this.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|If you like movies with a twist, this movie is a perfect match.  The well known actors do a phenomenal job and if you have not seen this movie, you are missing out!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Went along pretty close to the book! I loved it! I hope they make a sequel that follows the other books!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|It may not be the deepest or subtlest movie of the year, but for what it is, this movie executes and achieves 100% perfection. I went into this movie in the cinema expecting an amusing Toy Story-like experience and came out with expectations blown completely away.<br />Every tiny detail is so completely perfect that it's a delight to watch whether you're an adult or a child. Anyone who enjoys computer games and remembers the days of arcades will be particularly delighted, but it's not at all necessary to hugely enjoy the movie.<br />Added bonus: strong, three-dimensional female characters (more than one!) steal the show without ever feeling forced, despite the titular male lead. And Fix-It Felix voiced by the actor who plays page Kenneth on 30 Rock is icing on the cake.<br />This is the only new release movie I've hurried to buy on disc in years. Adult or child, parent or not, this is a movie you'll love.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was leary of all the hype but this is a great page turner. Interesting format, love the two sides to every story.
0765325950|4.0|1- Thank you Robert Jordan et. al. for the many hours of pleasure.<br /><br />2- Why only 4 stars? The first 10-20% of the book was too superficial - I guess they did not want to make another book. A shame- they missed an opportunity.<br /><br />3- GREAT ENDING!!  Less predictable than I expected and yes, I cried.<br /><br />Finally - what will I do next year when no new volume comes out?!?!  I guess we are in the Fourth Age...
0205313426|5.0|always a must in the reference library . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My two year old and four year old daughters love this movie! We will have to buy it to add to our kids movie collection.
B00555X8OA|5.0|great book. well worth taking the time to read something that is not fluff and trite . . . .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a sweet book and an easy read. Another Nicholas Sparks home run. Now I can't wait to see the movie!
B003647BNQ|2.0|loved the movie, but find this soundtrack difficult to listen to.....boring. I will attempt to listen again when I'm ready to fall asleep.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought those wall decals for my daughter's birthday and it was just the perfect gift. She was delighted and so was I. The result is really great, they are very easy to stick, we did it together and spend a very good time. Highly recommended for a little girl ! The articles were even delivered sooner than expected.<br />J'ai acheté ces articles pour l'anniversaire de ma fille (6 ans). Elle était aux anges. Ces stickers sont très faciles à positionner ou repositionner et rendent vraiment bien. Livraison plus tôt que prévu, un plus.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Interestingly, this is my 6 year old son's favorite app. He is constantly asking me to see it and then he runs outside and checks the real moon.<br /><br />There is nothing critical about having this that I can see, it is just a well done, well thought out app that is informative.<br /><br />I like it, too.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Although it was extremely stressful, parts of it were predictable. LIked it, but not as much as I thought I would.
0470913029|5.0|Not only am I losing weight, my stomach ache, that I've had for years and the doctor can't find a reason, has cleared up completely!  I feel better then I have in years!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not ready for that. You can't be. But, you will never want to stop reading this book. Flawless.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like the story of survival and the unexpected twist this series have.<br />I think this is the best zombie show ever.
B008Y73940|5.0|Movie had a good plot with many twists and turns, humor and sadness; kept my interest all the way through. Solid acting from all the cast.
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|Normally wouldn't care that much, just frustrating when I pay for the HD option. I will say the movie was good though.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a really helpful dictionary with all of its pages what like 532048 pages how can it let you let you down there's every word in the WORLD!how can you NOT LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I've had the same computer for 10 years and finally built a new one a few weeks ago.  I went with Intel this time because AMD motherboards don't support pci express 3.0.  Now I can stream hd video to my living room tv while downloading movies from multiple programs, surfing the web, transferring massive amounts of data to a usb3.0 drive, AND watching tv with a tuner card all at the same time flawlessly.  I'm ready to go for another 10 years.
1451695195|4.0|I like this book because it is always interesting to hear what people with these experiences have to say about their &#34;trip&#34; to wherever.  I also like to hear how it changes their perspectives, something that the entire human race could benefit from.  The book is well written and enjoyable.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I built a new computer and went with Intel because AMD motherboards don't have pci express 3.0.  This motherboard has tons of features to keep me ready for the future.  I can stream hd video to my living room tv while using several downloading programs, transferring tons of data to a usb3.0 drive, surfing the web, and watching tv with a tuner card all at the same time and it works flawlessly.
B00B10CT7A|4.0|Worth watching. It was not over the top with the drama. Excellent footage. I really enjoyed it; it is a worthy film - rare amongst today's options.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids enjoy this game because of its building mode and survivor mode. They love it!<br />It's worth the 6.99
B003M98792|5.0|I would give this movie 10 stars.  I grew up watching this movie with my dad, a fellow movie buff, brings back fond memories, and let's face it, it is quite AWESOME!!!!, I would recommend this movie to anyone, although, it is not for all....the last part is in reference to the &#34;violence&#34;.  Hope this helps!!!
0385535147|5.0|It was much better then I expected. I couldn't put it down.I would recommend to all my friends and relatives.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|It's not that I did not like the book but it just didn't grab my interest. The plot is like the movie where a woman finds herself living a very mixed up life. It gets better towards the end but the author misses out on a great opportunity for that &#34;Happily Ever After . . . &#34; ending!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great suspense and action where it keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />Great read and once stated cannot but the down until you are finished.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I got this for my hubby and we watched the entire season together. All the hype about the acting and writing are true...it's excellent. However, it's one story line broken into episodes. So if you are getting bored of discovering who the bad guy is (they tell the audience who it is at the beginning) and tired of waiting for the &#34;good guys&#34; to get there, then this isn't for you. I wish they had that storyline plus an episode sub plot for each episode. I think that would make the next season more interesting. Personally I like strike back better...a must see MI6/CIA spec ops thriller series.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|It's the best book in the series yet. I'm so excited to see what happens next. Very catchy and interesting. I can't stop thinking about it.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I received this dvd soon after I ordered it.  As a Denzel Washington fan, I expected good acting and an interesting plot.  What surprised me was the quickness of the delivery and the quality of the dvd, although I was a little disappointed about the plot,...but that is not Amazon's fault.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game that works great with keeping my family entertained while there is nothing  to do.I enjoy this game and rate it as a 5 star *****
B009UX2YAC|4.0|the one reason i dont like this game is because my friend sometimes will steal my kindle fire just to play this and burns my battery dead but yea i think its a pretty dang good game....
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a nice alarm clock app. it will still go off even if your Kindle is asleep but not if it is off. you can h.wake with a favorite song but only one and not a list. but you can play several songs inthe go to sleep mode. can also display clock on Kindle screen if desired.
B0057LUI0O|4.0|The movies great, enjoyable for parents and kids. The pace keeps up and the music is decent. Three more words...
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Great. Really got engaged. It keeps you in its grip till the very end. It described the emotions of the characters
B002SSUQFG|5.0|ordered this for my 11 year old and he loves it!  wears it all the time and likes that it glows in the dark!
B007704HO6|5.0|The real and touching story of two living beings (a man and a cat) supporting each other.<br />It is also a true lesson of life and and redemption
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was looking for a new tv series to watch and after the Pilot of this show, I was very impressed. It was very entertaining. And since I'm a true lover of the X-Files, this is similar to the X-Files.<br />Of course it's very Fiction, but it allows for your imagination to get carried away with the show.<br />I'm on Season two now and so far so good. I'm glad that Amazon Prime provides me these episodes for free.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I have always liked Star Trek and now I love the next generation.  I liked all of the seasons of the next generation.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The movie is definitely one to buy for the collection. Disney and PIXAR always puts out a good animated film
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The characters were well developed, the suspense was well balanced with revelations, and the ending was very satisfactory. I only wish Mr. Larsson could have had more time on this earth to produce more great writing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was an interesting and quick read. It kept you engaged and had some surprising twists to it. The ending left me wanting more and I would like to see a part 2. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and suspense.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE this show!  It's an absolutely wonderful cast and the writing is great.  Getting a glimpse of what this kind of life might have been like from both sides (servants and the aristocracy) is so much fun and it's so well done.  It is also interesting to see the portrayal of how real events which occurred during this time period might have impacted society.  But most of all - it's just great acting and super fun to watch!  I'm always looking forward to the next episode.  This is must see TV.  Note:  The first episode in season 1 was a bit hard for me to get into at first...but trust me - push through it - you'll end up loving it.
B000001F7R|5.0|Not as polished as there newer albums. But still a good one. And you can not get this on iTunes.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Great app for my Nexus 7.  Allows me to read more and taek my Nexus 7 to quiet corner and read.  Will recommend this app to all my friends.
B005721W9O|4.0|Yes it is a spoof but very funny. Love watching it over and over again. L o v e I t.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought Temple Run was the best but I was wrong. This is a step up which I could not believe. Waiting for TR  THREE.
B001HMSFFC|3.0|Move along nothing to see here. Just like the tv show that was on HBO. But women love it. Fin
B0086700CM|5.0|A six year old turned me on to this game and it is definitely my favorite. Not just for six year olds.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Just a good zombie slash Halloween movie. Has some fun parts and not so dark that it won't scare the kiddies.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I enjoyed reading this, but not as much as some books.  It was a little cheesey at some parts, and slow at the beginning. After secrets started coming out it was more exciting. It base around high schoolers, but had a lot of detailed sexual situations.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Not true to history but still good entertainment,I enjoyed watching it enought to have now gone on to the second season
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Show is worth all the hype. You get hooked on the story and the characters.  Worth the money and time spent watching
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Anna Faris is one of my favorites! And she did a fantastic job in this movie. I love it! The little love story is so cute!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very interesting I well-defined this book to everybody that likes books with action and mystery very confusing at times but you can understand it afterwards
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I love this movie. It really shows everything you need to know and it shows loyalty of family! I think this movie is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A ton of fun.  Challenging.  I lose a lot of hours in this games.  Pretty satisfying to beat the big puzzles.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is a little odd but it is so funny! Its not like Glee... at least not how I picture Glee... this movie is hilarious and I recommend for a good laugh.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The last 5% of the book makes this a masterpiece of literature. It changes everything. Up until then, I thought this was a decent read; intriguing, mysterious, and new. However, I didn't not think it was exceptional, mostly because I the story hadn't met its promise that it would make me believe in God. I'm not an Atheist, but the book hadn't renewed my faith, so to speak. Until I processed the ending! It is beautiful! The story has more meaning than 98% of books and movies I've seen. And I actively seek those out! If you are deciding whether to read this or not, I couldn't recommend this enough to anyone who could call themselves introspective, questioning, or the like.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|I was never wrapped in by the story and I didn't really get the point and if I did get it, it was not interesting enough to keep my attention.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The real story of human kind. Couldn't stop reading. Well written.<br />If we like it or not, the \\"Hunger Games\\" captures history, present and the future of us.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love this movie. Fantastic jobs for all around. Charlie is such an awesome character in this movie. It almost makes me want to read those books
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Powerful but disturbing message of addiction.  I don't believe the depiction of the events in the movie.  Too close to the ground for the roll.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season of the walking dead is really good, it had a lot of suspense, and it was very interesting. I give it five stars because it is able to keep me focused, hoping something bad wasn't going to happen to one of the characters.<br /><br />I like having a show to watch when I'm bored, and I hope this makes other people consider watching The Walking Dead.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cable is to replace the Kindle cable that disintegrated recently. This one looks like the cable coating is much better.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|It was a good movie, that I feel like ran out of their allotted time and so  then wrapped up what should have been another 45 minutes in 5 minutes. All and all it left me feeling disappointed.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|i bought it for the girlfriend and she loves it. she has seen it about 20 times since we bought it :) great price!
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed the story line, a true love story. The activeness of some parts could of been less, but the overall, the trilogy was well written.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Work gave me a huge HP laptop and a messenger bag.  Had to get a backpack to distribute the weight and this bag is up to the task.  Nice wide straps, lots of room, and no signs of wear after six months.
1416987118|5.0|I read this to my two girls, both toddlers, and they sing it along with me at the top of their lungs. Often when we are done reading, they want to play bear hunt with their daddy.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I rate this movie 5 stars because it was wonderful to see. I love the music, singing and dancing. The actors did a good imitation of being cats. It was sad at times but in the end it was a happy ending. I highly recommend this movie to any cat lover or animal lover in general.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I'm glad this game was free. All you do is walk around on some field, searching for eight pages. I heard this game played with your mind, but all it did was play cheesy sound effects reminiscent of Friday the Thirteenth movies. I did get startled a few times whenever I made a 180 degree turn and the Slenderman was right behind me, but there's really nothing scary about this. I guess this game could be scary if you're a young child who's not used to cheap horror elements.<br /><br />I really don't understand how this has so many five star reviews saying this is one of the scariest games ever made. There's a computer version of this game that is slightly better, but please realize this is not saying much at all. I find this whole Slenderman nonsense to be disappointingly stupid.
B009POCG2C|5.0|As an aging American myself, I was delighted to see age played with a 360 degree view.  Yes, there are failing body parts but also there is a measurable wisdom that the years do indeed bring.  Amy Adams did a nice job of playing the offended-but-responsible daughter.  Clint Eastwood's gravelly-voice and irasible manner may have been &#34;done to death&#34; as his schtick, but it was right on the money for this part.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I'll admit I only played it for a short while but that's the amount of time that it held my attention. If I had nothing else to do I would play this to pass the time.....maybe. It was nothing really exciting about it. I really didnt feel satisfied after achieveing the small goals they give you. Simply not my type.
030746363X|2.0|I started this eating program and got sick of all the beans you have to eat on the second day! Do Atkins, much more satisfying and no beans!!!
1419705849|5.0|In the day and age of smart phones, the Wimpy Kid series are the only books that my daughter will &#34;un-plug&#34; for. When she finished the last one, she put down the book and said, &#34;I can't wait for the next one to come out!&#34;
B00BESFWBY|4.0|Obviously this movie rewards you with the visual effects of riding a big wave, and what separates this from just the ok movies is the fact that it's based on the life of a real surfer who later died at the ripe age of 23 in a diving accident. It lacks the flow and depth to make it a classic, but well worth it if you like the outdoors and bitter sweet stories of courage and triumph.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|The many different calculators included with the app was awesome, especially the programmer one.  This was a good pick for the free app of the day.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|It's my favorite of the series I hope my recommendation help someone else to discover the whole series they truly are GREAT!!!
1401224792|4.0|I entered the world of Fables about 1/2 way into its current life cycle and have loved it. Werewolves is a good addition but not my favorite, mostly because of the artwork, just wasnt my style. The story was also not the best, but still passable.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Eminem and Royce da 5'9 kill co op album with sick flows and interchanges between each at the drop of a hat. Good old fashion REAL hip-hop.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|I didn't care for it too much.  I liked the stars in the movie, so that's why I watched it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book, a must read so you can see the end of the series.  Doesn't keep up with the first two in terms of storyline, but would absolutely recommend it.
0316069434|3.0|As a huge Michael Connelly fan I really looked forward to reading his newest book - \\"The Black Box\\".  I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book but found the resolution of the book not very credible.  The ending was strictly boiler-plate detective books and lacked the intelligence and style of Connelly's previous works.  I was a little disappointed but remain an ardent reader and hope his next effort is back in form.
B00AGKH45I|4.0|Packed! with Goodies from DVD, to Extras, to Lush Vinyl.  Reissues can be filled with garbage but this one hits the mark on what is a  legendary record.
0792846443|5.0|I felt his pain when Kathy Bates broke both is ankles.  That scene is definitely not for the sqeemish.  Evenso, I was compelled to add this movie to my collection.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great story lines and intrigue.  Very funny too.  Good show to just curl up on the couch with some tea at night.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|Its because I never figured out what it it was to be used for or how to do it.  It wasn't either  not explained or I didn't comprehend. The directions

B0013527I4|5.0|I always liked the mullets and now I have all the series of it.  It is one of those you can keep watching over when nothing is on tv
B004HD61KE|4.0|I enjoyed the plot but warn readers not to let the book sit for too long once it has been started.  There are multiple venues, characters and story lines and delays between ready could render one confused.  It was a fun read for me.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I have tried to read  every offering by Grisham, never to be disappointed.<br /><br />His style grabs my attention, carrying me smoothly through the course of his plots regardless of their complexity.<br /><br />The Testament not only provides an entertaining read but offers some insight for basic legal principals and a travelogue of the Amazon basin. A skillful merger of fancy with fact.<br /><br />Hope he writes more.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Great one-liners, cast and crew! Amazing script and Fat Amy pretty much makes the movie perfect! Perfect!

B0097HSS4M|3.0|This is a good app, simple, basic, easy to use.  It just doesn't have a LOT of ideas for your pictures.
1451627297|5.0|One of my favorite Stephen King books/people expect all of his books to be scary but except for one that I have read (The Shining) they tend to be more the fight between good and evil. It's just that sometimes evil wins.This book is a true gem and am very happy I have added it to my bookshelf
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Author Elizabeth Haynes has created a novel that is very well written, flowing smoothly from the gripping beginning to the unusual ending. It was thoroughly enjoyable, and as an avid reader of virtually every type of literature, I found this to be one of the best reads I've had this year. I found myself entertained, frustrated, worried, angry, and finally, disappointed when it was over. Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game. Easily kept my sister quiet for ages and educational at the same time as even though it's a game it shows younger people just what they have to do  to care for a horse in real life.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The entire trilogy is excellent.  The authors style, research and clarity are above reproach.  A real pity there will be no more books from this author.  He has joined my top list of &#34;must reads&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is do fun and awesome when I play with my horse gem I have so much fun don't forget to play games
B00622B3MY|2.0|My 2 year old loves Cars, so my wife and I looked into getting Cars 2 for him and read the reviews.  Many parents say this movie is too violent for kids. But I know how sensitive some people can be so my wife and I watched the movie ourselves first.  I couldn't agree more with the other parents.  This movie is DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE for kids under 10 (use your own discretion, but its certainly not for a 2 or 3 year old). For an adult its actually very entertaining.  Its just a bummer that I cant let my kid watch it (and that I am stuck watching Cars 10,000 more times until my kid is 10).
B008H08XW2|4.0|The tracks I classify are in three categories. I think the first four tracks are nice.<br /> The other 5-9 tracks are supercool. They hit an emotional connection.<br />and 9-15 are supercool. If you want something cool and catchy; Buy this album. It's very cool.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great comic relief from the horse and chameleon.<br />Great character change in Flynn/Eugene.<br />Fitting end to bad behavior.<br />Way above average Disney 'toon!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The new temple run is so different and just as addicting as it used to I have been wondering if there's an end and if there is do they celebrate? If not I think they should make a end if a temple run 3 comes out.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My 20year old daughter loves this movie!  Everybody said that my daughter looked like Matilda when this movie first came out... OMG... SHE'S 20 now! wow...
B0091REZMW|1.0|I actually loved this game.  But with the continual updates they have made it unplayable on my Droid Razr.  It will force close after 1 room search or visiting a few of my friends.  The file is now over 160mb so it's a space hog.  With the latest update, I can't even open the game.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it compelled me to look at how I think of things. It also helped me to be able to look at people and identify potential mindset issues that they may have.  I am a coach of adults and this reading will come in handy regarding such. Also I will recommend my &#34;clients&#34; read this to help open their minds some. The only complaint is the number of examples... A few too many!
B004X75RK4|4.0|I love both actors and thought the movie was entertaining.  The little dog was really cute too-wish I had one just like it
B004ZNA7WY|4.0|No Roger Waters deep song writing but the album's not bad...........i put it on to relax me when i pass out at night........a Pink Floyd fan would appriciate this effort.......
0374533571|4.0|Like many who have recently reviewed Matthew Quick's debut novel, I had the experience (for better or worse) of seeing the film first. The movie was phenomenal, and with such strong performances by all involved, I was excited to pick up the novel as a gift for my girlfriend (I couldn't help but read through it before giving it to her). The book is great and I most assuredly enjoyed it, but it is also very different from the movie.<br /><br />Like in the film, our lovable protagonist Pat People's is recently out of a psych ward and on a probation of sorts while living with his parents. The overall story arch mirrors the film: he's obsessed with getting fit, has a strained and difficult family life, and is convinced he can end 'apart time' with his wife Nikki, all the while ignoring the new woman in his life, Tiffany.<br /><br />Where the two differ is in their focus and character development. Firstly, the mental state of Pat himself varies in its degree. In the book he does not know why he ended up in the mental ward, and his disposition is much more childish. Other reviewers have commented on this and said that they found it made Pat less believable. I would have agreed for a good portion of the book, but by the end of the novel his head injury is explained and we see that the nature of his mental illness changed his character significantly. He is literally a different man than before the divorce. Also, because I do not know much about mental health and have never had friends or family struggle with it (that I know of) I have to give some grace to Mr. Quick.<br /><br />The most uplifting change made to the movie was Pats father (played by DeNiro). In the movie he is redeemable and attempting to make himself a better man, very much like his son. In the book though he is simply a terrible person, and his relationship with those around him is determined COMPLETELY by the fate of the Eagles. This might seem absurd to some, but it personally felt like a more preposterousversion of the relationship I have with my own father. Replace 'Eagles' with 'Republicans' (and subtract me from the tailgating).<br /><br />Lastly, the dynamic between Pat and Tiffany feels considerably less fleshed out in the book compared to the film and I found myself wanting to find out more about her. His obsession with Nikki overshadows any real character development with Tiffany. And though they both end very similarly, I felt Jennifer Lawrence turned Tiffany into a much more believable character.<br /><br />Overall, both book and movie are great. The lighthearted tone of the movie (interspersed with tremendously awkward or difficult conversations and episodes) is reflected in the book by the authors equally lighthearted and occasionally gritty prose. It is a quick read (sorry for the pun) and I very much recommend it to any who liked the movie. It will, indeed, make you smile.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this final book of the trilogy....all three books were wonderful reads, even thought they are geared for junior high school read, I totally could not put any of these books down.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|But found out something much more serious, interesting, sad and funny. A great book to read indeed. And it gave me New information
0896898288|5.0|I love that the book incorporates essay responses from The Farmer's Wife magazine. The fact that the author has take some really great essays and paired them with quilt blocks is fantastic. It's an interesting read and the pictures are simply fantastic. The book comes with a cd of the templates needed to create the blocks. There are a ton of quilt blogs in blogland that have tips and hints - it's so popular you could probably see a million different color ways if you're trying to get an idea for colors. I would definitely buy this again. Currently a quilt friend is borrowing the book because she just can't wait to get started on it!!

B00005LB50|5.0|More than I expected,I had all three of their LP's so I know the music and the the offspring i.e. Stills, Young and Poco with Richie Furhey . Interesting how the BF stuff became staples for those three musicians forty years later, great stuff.(recently I saw  both  CSN and Poco they did &#34;Bluebird, and &#34;Kind Woman&#34; respectively)  You can draw a line to half of rock back to this group, with all the people that they played with and influenced. Some hidden gems among the more familiar and underated tracks. .
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this novel! Lot's of forensic and courtroom stuff mixed with family dynamics. It'll keep you guessing - it'll make you change your mind... my kind of book.  I recommend this for male or female readers.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thought that if this book had been on the bestseller list for so long that it had to be good.  This book was far to predictable and took half way through before it actually picked up any momentum at all.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book is quite dark as you can imagine from the title. I enjoyed the writing style and the subject matter definitely held my interest. I recommend this book for a reader that is interested in the oddities of human behavor. I found it highly interesting.
B008C20TDG|5.0|So informative and well written. I cannot wait to try the recipes in the back of the book. All of the additional resources are priceless! I've been on the program for two weeks and I feel fabulous! Thank you thank you thank you!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book. Have looked for other books by this author and will most likely buy one.in the future.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Helped right my bias against romantic dramas. More open to it now. I would recommend watching it. Don't miss the last 10 minutes.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The book is good, and the story line keeps you wanting to read. There are spelling errors and grammar errors present, something that the publisher should have fixed. even one good read through could have fixed them. The book also feels rather rushed as well, but overall the plot is good.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very fun and relaxing game...I would reccomend it to anyone. I play it on my Kindle hd fire and the colors are awesome.<br />So go for it when you have a chance.

B000URWYTS|4.0|I felt the author did her research and gavea good insight into Frank's life. Also the ongoing sruggle of woman and their independence was so true.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I got introduced to Macklemore through the Tiny Desk concerts on NPR. He's got some more thoughtful ideas compared to most hiphop, and some really outstanding collaborators. Love it!

B0083Z614S|4.0|This was my book club selection for the month and was delighted I was able to download for free!  I hadn't read this book before and once I began it I coudn't put it down.  The characters were well developed and the story enchanting.  I had seen the movie years ago,  but the book was so much better!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Brave is a nice animation movie .. My little one enjoyed the movie. Good to  watch as a family movie. Animations and hd quality was great.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Great new album.  The sound that I expected, hoped for, and Bonnie delivered.  And the collection has a great fresh feel, too.
0765325950|5.0|Let me start by saying that Brandon Sanderson had some huge shoes to fill and I believe he filled then well even if he had to double up on his socks (-; A Memory Of Light is a fitting ending to an amazing series and my personal all time favorite series of books. I started reading WOT about 3 years ago when I first discovered it and having to wait for the last few books was utterly painful. The end has finally come and it was an epic journey. Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for the fine work you have displayed in this superb work of art. I look forward to Brandon's next volume of work and hope he can live up to his involvement in this project. Finally to put to rest some of the responses related to how this book was released I will share my thoughts. Brandon Sanderson, Tor Fantasy and no doubt Robert Jordan's estate had a say in releasing this volume in physical form first. It was not convenient for me on the night of the release to drive to a Barnes and Noble to purchase it. I didn't like that I had to buy a hard copy and that it cost more than I usually spend on books. I am still sure I would have preferred the convenience of a digital copy on my e-reader, but now that I am finished with the series it seems like a trivial issue to mark down the merits of a book based on a marketing/business decision by the parties involved. The bottom line is that if you have read and enjoyed all the books in the WOT series you should have jumped at the chance to show your support for all the hard work and creativity that was put in to it over all these years.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|This movie is worth watching just for the amazing performances by Seymor Hoffman and Phoenix. However, it was hard to get through do to the extremely slow start and convoluted storyline.
B00AF6B22E|3.0|This movie was great up until the crash....then it dragged on and on.  Not one of my favorite for sure.
1939416019|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down. All the characters were great and the story line was great. Can't wait to start the next book when it comes in the mail!!! I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a good read!

B006CC0YB0|5.0|As a follower of the Screaming Trees I have needed a fix for quite some time.  Mark Lanegan was one the brothers in this amazing band.  Queens of the Stone age featuring Mark was awesome as well, but his own stuff?  Magnificent.  Thank you Mark for continuing to share your music.  Whenever I'm in e-burg I still look for Mark wandering around because he's a friendly dude too!<br /><br />People, his vocals are awesome.
B000000992|5.0|Great album to own on vinyl. Maynard is my favorite singer / performer / song writer. I think he's beyond our generation. Highly revolutionized and if everyone could listen to what he has to say, the world would be a better place.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|Great script, great acting, great directing. Loved it. So did my kids. And that's the most important part. L o v e d it.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of Marvel movies and this was the start of it. When I saw this movie I absolutely fell in love with Chris Evans (Captain America). He is absolutely phenomenal in this film, along with all the rest of the actors. The directors did a amazing job capturing the story and making it feel like it actually happened in the 40's. I'd like to say this also made me love the 40's era. From the beginning of the movie, you already have foreshadowing to finding Captain America in the ice. There is also foreshadowing to the other Marvel movies, Iron Man and Avengers. Steve Rogers ends up befriending Tony Stark's father, Howard Stark. Howard is actually the one to create Steve's super strength.<br />  Not only is this movie jam packed with action and suspense, but it's got a good amount of humor and romance as well. I wasn't aware when I first started watching that Steve Rogers would gain a love interest. Although when Peggy Carter came in I loved her character immediately. In most movies, all sergeants are men. I love that this had her as a tough girl. She wasn't afraid of punching a man and showing them she's not a helpless women. Even when Steve saved her from getting hit by a car, she wasn't afraid. That's another thing, Steve Rogers is extremely respectful and caring. I love that about him. He, too isn't afraid of a lot. He was weak and still wanted to stand up for his country to get rid of the \\"bullies\\" as he would say.<br />  I've seen this movie many times, and each time I watch it, I'm amazed by the cinematography. It's absolutely gorgeous. From the sky scenes to the way the camera moves around the actors. The same goes to the orchestra soundtrack. The soundtrack really gives me chills, especially in the end.<br />  I would definitely recommend buying this movie. It's ones of those movies you could sit on your couch with a nice bowl of popcorn and cry over how stunning it is. Not to mention Chris Evans is pretty attractive.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I thin the game is Awsome cause I can chat with my friends and build a base and attack other people I think this is the best game on my device
B00136NUG6|5.0|How can you go wrong with music by Earth Wind & Fire. This phenomenal band has a unique sound that makes everyone - young and old - get up a move.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The entire movie was about drugs and sex, the trailer was the entire &#34;plane crash&#34; movie, all of the rest was a lot of sex, drugs and swearing.  The lesson out of the movie was if you find yourself not being able to stop taking drugs then just do cocaine and everything will work out just fine. Seriously!!!<br />I would not recommend this movie.  I use to really like Denzel Washington, but the fact that he stooped to this level, has made me now want to see another movie he is in.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|I just love this movie! It is a great chick-flick (has love and a cute guy) and family movie (there is a moral/lesson to learn).  I first saw it on cable years ago and something reminded me of it.  I just had to see it again and Amazon was the easiest/quickest way.

B007REV4YI|2.0|Great movie, the best Bond Movie to date.<br />Ordered the Blue-ray/DVD with Digital Copy and major disappointment was the Blue-ray within the first 5 minutes of the movie the movie skipped and resumed playing to 10 minutes of the movie. A whole 5 minutes of the movie lost.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is amazing.  I only had one problem with it, and that was connecting Bike Race to Facebook, and I solved that by unistalling this then connecting, and reinstalling it.  But it's a great app other than that
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Violent but good I was continually surprised by the turns this movie took, it is not usually my kind of movie but this is a good one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it its a fun game but don't listen to other people try its a really fun game!!!!!!!!!!! try it you'll love iy
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was an easy read but I found it very choppy at times. Hate this ending!! Now I have to finish the series.
0439023491|5.0|Just as I expected! I love this author, her books are so easy to read and she gives the characters so much life that I find it impossible to not be drawn right in to the world that Katniss lives in!<br /><br />This book also came in large print which is very helpful to me as I am getting old LOL and my sight is not as great as it used to be.<br /><br />I also found the books length to be good to, it seems to me that some books do go on forever, maybe that is just because I did not like them as well as this one, this one was over way to fast.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone this book, great read!
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|Since I've never been to the Grand Canyon and probably never will get there, I was looking for a DVD that would display the grandeur of this place, and in my mind, this DVD falls short in that regard. The major theme instead is the need for water conservation, and how the amount of water in this region has been depleted over time.The photography is OK; maybe the Grand Canyon just isn't that grand.  It's just not what I expected.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|This kept me interested and I love Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks.<br /><br />I am not big into shoot em up movies but this one was very good and the story kept me on the edge of my seat!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I bought the album because of Thrift Shop (I have too much sad bastard music in my collection), but when I got around to listening to the other tunes, I was surprised by the complexity of some of the lyrics.  This guy isn't the Vanilla Ice of 2013, there is some substance to what he is putting out.
0439023513|5.0|I love this author, I read her first book in this series &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and fell in love with it, so I had to have the rest of the series, just as I expected it was amazing work,  the writing is easy to understand and keeps you interested and sometimes on the edge of your seat. Great author and great book I hope everyone will get the series and enjoy it as much as I did!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|couldnt have been more happy with the dvd purchase. bought it presale at 1 price and received it for less
B00123IATW|5.0|I downloaded this album to refamiliarize myself since I will be going to see them in concert in a month.  Wonderful album, and I'm looking forward to hearing it performed live in it's entirety along with Close to the Edge and Going For The One.
1569757275|5.0|I am in my third month of studying Mandarin.  I plan to visit a close friend who has recently moved to Beijing.  This is exactly what I needed to feel comfortable about the upcoming trip (several months from now).  It provides some very helpful cultural tidbits.  Aside from that, it is one funny read!  I laughed so hard at parts of this book that my cheeks still hurt.  Kudos to the author!!!!  Job well done.  If every book I picked up was this entertaining, I would undertake a great deal more very challenging learning experiences (like learning languages).  I read some of the paragraphs to my friend in Beijing and she is still laughing--plus, she verifies the information is dead-on correct.  I'm an old lady and I don't have much use for the &#34;pick up&#34; lines--but if I get lucky enough to have someone use them on me, at least I will recognize them!<br />It has been a long time since I've read anything that was written as well or had so much good-natured humor in it.  Now my Chinese friend is laughing at more than my mistakes with the Chinese characters or grammar and we are both having lots of fun because of the great material in this book.  I had been rather bored learning body parts--this changes everything!  Most surprisingly, I already knew most of the words--just not how to put them together to alter their meaning just enough.  I am convinced that one cannot learn Mandarin without understanding a great deal of the cultural differences between the US/Canada/Western world and Chinese culture.  This little book is better than a history lesson in providing cultural insights and the humor makes the lessons stick.  The stereotypes are dead on if you know anyone in China--it takes more than a little understanding to have the insight the author has in his comments; one has to be a purveyor of the human condition and part-psychologist, part-sociologist, part-anthropologist to gain the little tidbits of insight given in this tiny book.  I am having difficulty even imagining the depth of knowledge this author has and then am blown away that he has been able to condense it so efficiently and with such great humor.  I'd love to spend an evening with this guy just to pick his brain (especially if we were drinking and watching a steady stream of people pass by on whom we could comment).  It would probably be the funniest evening of my life.  This is MUST READ if you are American and have no Chinese friends and plan to visit China.  Don't go without it!magining the depth of knowledge this author has and then am blown away that he has been able to condense it so efficiently and with such great humor.

B009NOVCU6|4.0|This is a good Stones collection but I feel they left out a few classics such as &#34;Can't you here me knockin'&#34; and &#34;Shattered.&#34;  Otherwise it's great.
0345803485|1.0|I found this book totally distasteful and it saddens me to think that so many woman out there got turned on by it.  UGH!
B00B2EWBMI|4.0|Kung Fu - Rza and Q.T.  action packed with a great cast. great fighting scenes and a love story  nuff said!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Being a BOND fan I was not disappointed.RAnks right up there among the few Bond Movies with this high quality.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Excellent story keeps the pace of the character flow as the characters grow over time....the evolution of the characters and the various plots provide an interesting dynamic that is a credit to Vince Flynn and thus his books are a good read....it seems he is at the point if introducing another supportive person/persons to the Mitch Rap team of resourceful talents....perhaps it is time for Mitch to find a new heart throb as he moves forward?
B00472NZDQ|4.0|This is much what you expect from Connelly. A solid story, more focused on a courtroom trial perhaps than a straight up Bosch novel. On balance I preferred the earlier Bosch but nonetheless enjoyed this. I know its been slated by others but perhaps that is more to do with expectations based on Connelly's earlier work than a true failure of this book. Taken alone , its a solid thriller. Not the strongest  have ever read but good enough to make me stay up to finish it. The ending left me vaguely unsatisfied, there were story threads that just sort of fizzled out. But I enjoyed the build up and Hallers foray into prosecution. Good book for the sun lounger.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I read the books, but don't have HBO (or even cable) so I finally decided to watch the show and it's amazing
B009LDXQGW|5.0|On his Freshman Album, The Weekend introduces himself through a trio of CD's. I was impressed at the overall quality. While the lyrics are a tad harsh and raw, I think his music is genius!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I could watch this movie 50 times and still love it, it plays great!  The whole family loves to watch it.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I like this artist and this cd was okay but I know it could've been better. The song towards the end of the album with Andre Benjamin was a game-changer for me.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|There's not much to say except this is a great movie, my family and I love it and the Blu-ray works great.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great dictionary to use for schoolwork and just for curiosity.  You can translate your search into different languages and the homepage is full of fun activity.  I recommend getting this dictionary.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you want to know what happens on the battlefield, this is a must read.  I felt like I was sitting in a room listening to war stories.  The way he writes about his wife is lovely.  A truly great man.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Awesome positive life changing read. Recommend all three books; The Secret, The Power and The Magic. Also great to reread for inspiration.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I love hearing his voice!! Great to see him expressing his gift of music.This is a very Happy Gir l:)
B000W3Q1HG|5.0|I think this book is about the best rules of life to live by.  It has helped me in my day to day living.
037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite childhood book. It is exactly as I remember, with no changes. a great story for little ones
B009OYSFDM|3.0|...but it is just ok... at least the episodes I've seen so far.  The story line is a good one... just too unrealistic.  Surviving and Coming home after thought to have died w/his father at sea, the main character vows to right wrongs.... his and any other bad guy doing dirty business.....  This could work w/out the costume, camo face paint and bow and arrow... and probably be more believable at that....  We'll see....  I still have more episodes to watch.
0765325950|5.0|The last book, sigh. So freaking good. I have to say, I could notice little differences in the writing style of Sanderson vs. Jordan, but they are different people so...<br /><br />It was a great ending to a great series. I have spent so many hours with this series, it's sad that it's over, but it was a satisfying ending, which can be hard to do when it was so long awaited.
B008476HBM|3.0|I am having trouble staying interested in reading this book. It's in old English so the verbage is different than we speak nowadays. But I know it's a 200 year old book, so of course the wording will be different. Plus it keeps bouncing around between characters and calls people by a couple different names. I am not enjoying this book very much but I do not like to not finish a book when I start reading it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book, but at times it lagged along and I wanted the characters to get on with their stories.  The format was interesting.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Really interesting story about how life might have been in the days of slavery - both for negroes and immigrant, indentured persons.  Everything bad that could happen, does happen and the story ends rather abruptly as to the characters.  However, I would definitely recommend it.  It provoked a lot of discussion at my book club.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun. It works in real time and you can do all kinds of activities. Fun for kids and adults.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am NOT a Stephen King fan, so when my book club wanted to read this book I was skeptical and prepared not to like it.  The opposite happened and I loved it!  I do remember when Kennedy was shot, so it was good to have details recalled for me.  I appreciate the imagination the writer put into this story - and since I like time travel stories, this was enjoyable for me to read.  I highly recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|its fun to play but it pops up on retarded advertisements every 2 seconds. even if i get the app it still pops up. and its huge and blocks a quarter of the screen and i cant see!!!! some retarded advertisement called bingo heaven or or something. it's like if i wanted to get it then i would have it by now!!!!!
B00B3HJMLM|3.0|still listening to this cd, maybe after a few run thru's it'll be ok.  don't like the title, but that's ok, it's not for me anyway.  will see what happens this summer when the fun begin's again!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I give this game a HUGE FIVE STAR RATING i love the characters,the MEGA MONKEY,the new background,the zip line and tunnel an awesome sequel to the first one!
B009Z5975A|4.0|I know they didn't make a lot of extras back in the day but it would have been nice to have some extra material for the films. Not a major complaint mind you, I'm just happy to have these movies in my BR collection. :)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This series is amazing and really addictive. Once you read the first book you can't put them down until you have read them all!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Extremely addictive and twice as good as the original.  I could play it for hours on end.  A &quot;must have&quot; game for your collection.
0345803485|3.0|At first I couldn't put the book down, but about 100 pages in and I have sorta lost interest. The plot isn't as intense as what I'm used to I guess. Not sure what all the fuss is about. Maybe when I pick it back up ill change my mind.
0062014536|3.0|I keep thinking about Requiem. I loved it as a story, it was amazing but as an ending???? The more I think about it, the more let-down I feel.<br /><br />Lena is my ultimate dystopian heroine, more than Tris, Katniss, Ember, Juliette... There was something so real and normal about her that made you feel like if you were in the same situation you could cope too. We saw her go from a scared child afraid to feel to a freedom fighter who doesn't lay down and weep (Yeah you! Bella Swan) but fights in the memory of those she loves.<br /><br />The ending of Requiem just...like that's how she's going to be honoured? That's a TRILOGY ending? I read from other fairly angry readers that perhaps Oliver decide to go down the literary high brow route and let the reader \\"draw their own conclusions\\" but this is YA Dystopian. Follow the Formula! A+B=Heart stopping romance and action not \\"umm okay so what up? I'm over here and we'll catch up later? Yo!\\"<br /><br />That plus the death of one of my favourite characters which I think angers me the most has me all up in a heap this morning! Ugh<br /><br />I know that the TV series was put into works before this book came out so perhaps there was a lot of pressure put on Lauren Oliver to end the series that way so Hollywood could do what it wants with it but I seriously don't see why Lena \\"book heroine\\" should get cast aside for Lena \\"TV heroine\\"<br /><br />This is my FAVOURITE Dystopian Series and will continue to be so for a long time but the only way I can rationally do that without tearing my hair out is to fool myself into thinking it's not over!<br /><br />Book Four coming FALL 2014!<br /><br />Seriously...just let me live in my delusion! :(
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|even with all the other ways to watch this i had to have the set. It came in perfect condition the packageing kept it well protected
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to start the final book in the series. Why did j wait so long to start reading these
1932735410|5.0|I read this book and discover many new professional rules for well known things in PM practice. Good practical advices, very clear language! I hope for usefulness.
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|I found McEwan to be a careful builder of character characteristics that provide clues and understanding to actions undertaken as the plot unfolds under the influence of multiple factors.l<br /><br />I especially appreciate the comparison between play writing and novels; the broad, but specific, remembrances of circumstances susrrounding Dunkirk, and the realities of hospital stress resulting from an onslaught of war impaired  and the various levels of skill and experience of hospital staff receiving them.<br /><br />His fashioning of attonment adds new thoughts about the process of forgiveness.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book series is awesome. I would recommend it to everyone. I think they should create a movie series to go along with the book's.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|love this show and this was a great price for it. came quickly. we are so glad to add this to our collection

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Although they didn't sing all the words like a &#34;musical&#34;, its hard to find a great singing movie since Grease. This was fresh, hilarious, and did not have to cringe at any inappropriate parts with my 11 year old. I didn't know Anna Kendrick could sing (of course she can, shes beautiful and a great actress) Only problem now is my daughter has to play 'cups' 24/7!
B0064W652A|5.0|Very very good read best graphic novel I've read in a while you should check out death in the family first
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a great movie. Right out of the gate I was on the edge and clinching my first. I also just gasp so many times through out the movie rooting for Denzel.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In is wicked-smart, wise and wondrous.  Sandberg's writing is clear and crisp.  And her content is compelling... from pragmatic advice on how to negotiate a job offer, how to get a mentor (don't ask)... to momentous matters such as making one's \\"most important career (and life) decision...\\"<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg is ruthlessly, intellectually honest.  And caring.  If you haven't met Sheryl, watch her TEDtalk.  Visit leanin.org.<br />And read this book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|With the lack of decent television - I find it nice to have something to watch from a more gentle time
B005USZML4|4.0|Good introduction to the legal system for the intended audience. Found the characters likeable and the story entertaining. Recommend to teens.
1250006341|3.0|It gave me information I didn't know - and a list of the actors - it didn't cover information from the third season
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What would happen if you could travel back in time and stop the assassination of JFK? How would history be changed? &#34;11/22/63&#34; by Stephen King deals less with the changes to history than the actual attempt to save JFK. Jake Epping travels back in time to 1958 to begin his quest to stop Lee Harvey Oswald and change the course of history. But in doing so, Jake discovers that history is not so easy to change, and in fact resists change. To complicate matters, Jake finds he likes his new life. Although it is a work of fiction, &#34;11/22/63&#34; offers the reader a history lesson along the way thanks to King's thorough research of the subject matter. This is a very thought provoking book and a thoroughly enjoyable read which I found difficult to put down. It has changed my view of Stephen King as an author having always equated his work with the horror genre.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The movie was entertaining but not the best of the Bond's.  I missed all the toys and gadgets Bond usually receives.
B00BHMF578|5.0|None stop action and suspense based in actual fact.  Thanks, Ben Affleck for a well directed movie!  It was great to be able to watch it in HD at home.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This is a boring history-writing piece. I can usually tolerate them if there is some sort of entertainment value. The first half packed with meaningless interrogations/torture. Seems like they added Chris Pratt to the final 20 mins to save this disaster (he's still kinda funny) Bad dialog. Ok, you've been warned. ...wasted xmas tickets on this.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I guess this the perfect movie for the international audience:  big brand, no plot, little dialogue, meaningless action....a series of poses where actors get all dressed up and make snappy comments....... followed by explosions and/or impossible escapes...leading to more dressed up poses and snappy comments etc.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is so easy and fun! whatever you're looking for is on pinterest. I recommend this app to all of my friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app ever.all you guys need to do is add something new and<br /><br />then you are ahead of temple run.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|who could ask for more?  This is a silly app and I don't really understand it but everyone in my house thinks it's so funny.  I see everyone (including the adults) playing with it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a game that can be challenging and hard but it's a lot of fun . The fun started when temple run started its amazing . The details of the game
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Extremely well done and entertaining. I enjoyed Season 1 and am looking forward to the following seasons. Educational as well regarding how Madison Avenue works to convence you that you need a product even if you don't.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|I am a HUGE Kelly Clarkson fan. I always have been. I am so glad I finally got this album.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Having documents and books at my fingertips is so convenient. Manuals, textbooks, even my spiritual readings are easily available. Great App
B009KPAN5I|5.0|I have been a fan of the original graphic novel for years, and never thought I would see the day this would get made. I was also afraid that I would be dissapointed with the results. I've gotta say, this thing rocks!  The 2 disk version is worth the extra cash for the awesome Bob Kaine documentary. I loved it,and you will, too.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great series of books and I do't read trilogies. Very enjoyable and Like Twilight.  Not just for young adults. Recommend it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE I LIKED THE CHARACTORS AND IT HAS A GREAT PLOT. I'M SURE YOU WIIL ENJOY IT.
B00APUTEBG|1.0|this was just another waste of film,it just kept going and going with no direction,no character developement,no nothing ,it actually feels like the director was making it up as he went along and put absolutely no thought into it,i cant even tell you what the movie was about the lost me in the first 20min,save your money and rent something else.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|Like the true story nature of the plot.  Great movie to have in my collection.  Will recommend it to others who are golfers at heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|To cool to all my friends I like it and they like it to<br />Minecraft is awesomely cool AWESOMELY COOL!!!<br />Minecraft minecraft minecraft
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The plot was kinda goofy. Not very plausable.  But interesting to watch - held my attention & decent acting most of the time.
B002DW92SE|3.0|I've never read any Hornby before - High Fidelity and About A Boy are probably his two most famous novels, but he's got a slew of others and a pretty large (and apparently quite devoted) fan base. And having read many of the reviews of his work, I was excited to read Juliet, Naked - unfortunately I wasn't as impressed as Hornby's minions.<br /><br />So here's the trajectory of this book - Intro: ok, ok, nice change of pace from the depths of depression of A Possible Life. I dig it, let's keep on keeping on. Beginning of body: character development - check, plot development - double check, we've got a goody on our hands! Middle of body: loving where this is going - what a great read so far... End of body: ok, we're losing direction a little, but maybe the end will pick up a bit. Ending: _______ ??? (a.k.a. no ending).<br /><br />Hornby tried too hard for that mysterious non-ending ending, but it just didn't work. What's worse, is that he had actually set himself up to have a really great book, but just kind of lost focus and let it flop. The characters were wonderful - until they weren't. And the story was heading in the direction of special - until it wasn't. Sorry old Nick-o, I just don't get what the hype is all about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm going to Florida and I'm 11 and so I don't get bord I'm going to play this for the 2 hour plane RIDE!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I hadnt seen the movie trailers or anything before I purchased the book, so I had no idea what to expect. I think that it turned out better that way, so that it played out very well and kept you interested. Very good read.
B005HSL626|4.0|Bought the free version of this game for my Kindle - fun to play with lots of different options (arcade, free play, etc.). I wish there was a little bit more to it, I don't like that you have to connect to the internet for some options. The achievements section is really neat though.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The research and the way it was organized made the historical facts interesting and informative. Because all these presidents except Hoover served in my lifetime, I was fascinated to learn what went on out of the public eye.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved it. Some parts were rough but I really enjoyed others. Amazing story and concept. I suggest reading it sometime when you get the chance.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I've had this backpack for about a year now and I don't know if I could ever go back to not having it. I can fit pretty much anything I need in there whether it be for going to class or for a weekend trip. Has an incredible amount of space. Also feels really good on my back, even when carrying a good amount of weight. Would definitely recommend this if you are regularly taking your Macbook Pro around with you. My 15in with a Neoprene case fits in the back pocket like a glove.
B005I0DLXK|3.0|It is just my personal preference.  I like the upbeat tunes (S&M, What's My Name?, and Only Girl very much.  Man Down is a good thought provoking tune.  The others are just... OK.  I'm glad I purchased the title, though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abby is a beautifully acted, scripted,photographed series.  The series is filled with human drama that transcends the era. I actually watched all three seasons in three days.  It was like reading a great book, I hated to stop watching because I wanted to know what was going to happen to each character.  You will, laugh, cry, and feel for,these people and all in the context of history and what was happening!  Loved it and anxiously awaiting season 4n
B007NESBK2|5.0|The show was spectactular. SADE stage presence was great and perfessional as usal.The art dirctor should win some kind of award.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|i saw this movie in theaters when i was around 9 to 11 years old and loved it and had not seen it for a while until it was on tv and this movie is so dumb and corny Channing Tatum and Sienna Miller do a terrible job the only 2 good things in this movie were the special effects and Snake Eyes played by Ray Park (Who played darth maul) go watch a better science fiction like the star wars trilogy, hellboy 1 and 2, or even transformers 1 and 3 (2 sucked but not as bad as this movie).  Alot of people hate the star wars prequels but i love them and will take them over this crapfest anyday.  Who needs this movie anyway the new gi joe coming out this year has a different director and it has bruce willis and dwayne johnson in it and most of this movie's cast is gone except ray park, channing tatum, and jonathin price.
B008OURHPY|5.0|Love her music, i heard one of the songs on xmradio and i fell in love with it. So i decided to buy the whole album
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Handy item to have on my Kindle and very useful for some one that plays work games and like crossword puzzles.
0060899190|5.0|These Post Secret books are amazing.  I read through the notes that people have sent in and am amazed at their experiences.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The movie kind of started slow, but it does draw you in, so be patient.  It is a good watch, funny, exciting, and even has a twist.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Fantastic, gripping thriller surprisingly written by a newbie. I enjoyed the intensity of the heroine as she revisits her past and learns to trust herself again. Maybe the timing of recovery is unrealistic to someone who knows therapy from a clinical or client perspective, but I let that slide and I found myself routing for her recovery. Ends on a bit of an odd note as it seems unlikely the arrogant bad guy would rat himself out, but it is only memorable as it is towards the end. Overall a good read.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|One of my favorite series now!<br /><br />Great story, all the seasons. It even makes you think about parallel worlds and what is with the other you... wonderful.
B001EOOQEC|5.0|The greatest studio album Dio recorded with this Sabbath lineup - powerful songs, aggressive production. A big difference here is Dio-s lyrical focus - reputedly, Iommi and Butler told him from the start that they wanted and needed something different. Unhappy with the decision, Dio nevertheless supplied some of the best lyrics of his career and delivered an impassioned vocal performance on this release.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|One of my favorite series now!<br /><br />Great story, all the seasons. It even makes you think about parallel worlds and what is with the other you... wonderful.
B001EOOQEM|3.0|Never has such a thin album been so praised as classic metal. However, it's little wonder, really. It's here, fronting Black Sabbath, that Dio began first cementing his image in popular culture as the cliched metal singer par excellence with his Devil Horns, sword and sorcery lyrics, and histrionic vocals. The poses that one now associates with Dio - it was here that he first popularized them on a massive scale.<br /><br />It's often been said that without RJD entering the picture in 1979/80, this band would have ceased to be. In my opinion, the finished product testifies to the idea that Black Sabbath, at least the vision of the band we knew from 1969-1978, was dead and buried. The extended jamming was gone. The peace and love hippie lyrics replaced with interchangeable, pseudo-mystical odes to misunderstood youth. Iommi's sound brightened, growing more sharp and brittle. By the time of this album, a band that hadn't been just one thing became just one thing: a heavy metal band. No more, no less.<br /><br />At least two songs are unmitigated filler - the band tacitly agree with this assessment as they were NEVER played live. A third, \\"Lonely Is The Word\\", one of the album's true gems, didn't get played much during the tour and, years later when Dio reunited with Iommi and Butler a final time, was sparingly played.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a great read, from someone who has truly been in the thick of the situation over in the middle east.  He is honest and very self-aware, and his wife has little snippets in the book telling how she felt about different situations that happened in their lives.  I wish I had read this prior to Chris Kyle's death, because I would have like to have sent him a thank you, but I think readers who like stories about special forces men, will appreciate this book because it is real, and not fiction.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I enjoyed learning more about India. This book worked well on an emotional level. I was at times sad, angry, and happy with the characters and their choices. I highly recommend this book.
B003FSTN52|4.0|Entertaining. It was a good story, I never saw the first season so wanted to catch up on the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THIS BOOK IS  ....................'N AWESOME<br /><br />THE SUSPENSE WAS AMAZING AND i loved ths book  it was AMAZING. I LOVED IT
6300215512|5.0|I saw this movie before on the Turner Classic Movies channel and wanted to own it. When the item arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find the VHS format of this item - and the package - in excellent condition! I've even loaned to a co-worker for him to enjoy. Top-of-the-line item! Top-of-the-line seller!
B00ADMYN9E|4.0|Having a personal experience with a UFO sighting in New England Australia in 1970'S I have read lots of books on the subject .Most books rehash information but this book although it does the same,it steps up the credibility by the status of it's author Colonel Philip Corso.<br />Colonel Corso credibility and professional reputation in the area of UFO'S with the US Armed Forces is enforced in the evidence he presents.<br />Highly recommended.
B001RIY49C|5.0|This was awesome. I have wanted a bust of the terminator endo skull forever and this one was within my price range. I'm planning on making a life size statue of the T-800 myself  but lacked the materials needed to sculpt my own skull. the rest I can make but this will help allot. I did end up modifying it after i received it. I took the extra black paint off of the temporal gears. The details are there they just went overboard with the black paint. I also didn't like the look of the red eyes they seemed to simple so I went and snagged some red lamps from Radio Shack and put them in because they are more screen accurate. Next I plan on repainting the teeth. I got it knowing I would be changing some things but even without my changes its an awesome bust. The movies also make a great add on to my collection. Now if amazon would just carry the T-600 bust with blue rays of the terminator salvation movie I can only find that on ebay and well...I don't like ebay.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|The movie left me unsatisfied. It has no conventional structure like a interesting story line, a plot and a logical ending. My wife and I deemed this a waste of time.  The acting performances by Hoffman and Phoenix were excellent.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|sorry diehard fans...the action from the first series, is far above than second....and having watched the third season, things are starting to drag! I know we need to get to know our characters, but their gonna die! I guess Im hard to impress!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I sometimes wonder why I still buy games for the 360 when I can very better addictive games for my Kindle?<br /><br />This little game is so much fun! I spent hours on it and did not realize how long it's been. It's about making games for consoles on the market. You can name your own company and name your own games that your staff makes. You can hire and terminate your staff, Train them, and give promotions. Over time New consoles come to the market and you buy the license to develop for that system. You also get fans and fan letters to your studio about your games you put on the market.<br />Give this game a try there is more to it than what I wrote! If you want to run your own game company this SIM game should give you what you want.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Awesome book slow at first but overall. Once you get into reading it. It is as good as \\"no easy day\\" and \\"american sniper\\".
B003YL4L0W|5.0|A page turner.  Sad to say goodbye when I'd finished it, and so I let the characters sit a few more days in my mind.  A challenging topic that confronts the ownership of the Pre-born child  within choices painted with love.  The growth of the plot and character through the court process reveals the true agendas at play.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great twist, and completely captivating. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B000WAGVHE|4.0|got the movie for a great price.  the only problem is that the case was cracked in the corner but the discs didn't have any problems and was still in place.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is for those who like godly action and a little romance in between. I liked reading about the the minor gods and the gods and all of this makes a good book to distract you from problems. Great book. I absolutely loved it
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book was a strange experience for me. It introduced many interesting themes, but lingered on them a little too long for me. The plot was somewhat slow and prodding. I would initially give this book 3 stars if it weren't for the interesting twists in the last chapters. It was enough to garner an extra star on its own.
B00846REIS|4.0|Was recommended by a friend. Too much like 50 shades of gray but a good read for sure. Will read the next one
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|The classical music reviewer Norman Lebrecht was right -- this is a dazzling Rachmaninov set that ranks with the very best ever done.  He ranks it with his \\"modern\\" favorite, the early 70s version with Ashkenazy playing and Previn conducting.  He also noted, interestingly, that the orchestra in each case was the London Symphony (though very few players, if any, would be the same for both sets).<br /><br />In all four concerti, Lisitsa brings a highly nuanced reading which sounds completely natural.  Too many players just play the torrent of notes, observing volume dynamics, but not doing much else with the pieces.  Lisitsa makes little tone poems out of various sections but yet manages to hold all the sections together as one.  If one listens closely one can hear not only great articulation (and power and speed where needed) but little accents and rubatos that make the pieces sing.<br /><br />The LSO's playing is also on a very high level.  Conductor Mike Francis, the double bass player who first made his name as a relief conductor when other conductors could not make a rehearsal, then graduated to his very own spots, is someone to watch.  The LSO's playing is magnificent, lush and precise.  I have read that Lisitsa sent videos to Francis before the recording sessions demonstrating how she wanted certain sections to be interpreted.  (One would love to see those tapes as an instructional device.)  The result is a razor sharp performance.  Tutti attacks are as if one instrument was playing.<br /><br />My theory about the LSO's gorgeous playing is this.  As is known by some, Lisitsa mortgaged her home to make these recordings, at a personal cost of $300,000.  Doubtless the LSO players knew something of this, because the circumstances of a recording session will be talked about among the players.  Now imagine you are sitting in a section of the LSO, having toiled for years in music school and now in a prestigious symphony.  But for many players there was always the hopethat they would break from the pack and become the next Dennis Brain or Midori or whomever.  I cannot help but think that the players played their hearts out for someone willing to risk all their savings on a project she believed in.<br /><br />Again, the piano playing by Lisitsa is heavenly, the orchestra is responsive, the sound is well engineered (in a few cases I would have liked the engineers to have brought out a bit more piano detail but I understand there are limits to this in a concerto setting).  If you want to hear the details of the piano playing, Lisitsa has recorded the solo versions of the concerti on her You Tube channel.  In fact listen to the separate parts anyway, because you likely will hear notes that no recording ever uncovers.<br /><br />I have listened to many many performances of these concertos over the years, from the famous and the obscure, and I cannot think of any that are better.<br /><br />Most highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|my son downloaded this app-its not my favorite-but my two oldest boys seem to like it, and I'm guessing the makers had their age group in mind from the start.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoy good mysteries.  This author is up there with the best of them.<br />I would recommend it to a friend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Soap opera of the upper crust that is well written, engaging and fun to watch.  Interesting twists and turns, most of which are believable.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game! love it,  love it,  love it. good game for all ages , wish there were more games this good
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love solitare games. it works well on my tablet. its just as good as solitare games that i have paid for. has easy to use options.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|If I could give this book minus stars I would mainly because it's rubbish without substance!  I ordered because it was the best seller and it saddens me that so many people read absolute junk, rather than the excellent literature that is available to be read.  I have spoken to friends and family about the fact that Hopeless is top of the best seller list on Amazon Kindle, and this is really a bad sign.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|Easy to take on and off. It does protect the camera well. I am very satisfied with this product. Great price
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season four. Why do they keep us in suspense like this! Can't wait for the next season.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Captivating hidden object game with a twisted plot and side games. Nice graphics and audio (I use headphones).  Still in the early stages of the game but keeps me coming back when I want something relaxing to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games! plenty of addicting games to chose from and lots of ways to earn points. recommend this app
0446581356|5.0|This book is the best that I have every seen written on the subject of makeup application.  The only thing that it was missing was a detail chapter on contouring.  That would have been very helpful.
B005KR6OBM|4.0|I really can't say as I haven't opened any of them up yet, as I watch the show on cable. I wanted to have copies of all of the shows, as I didn't start watching until about four years after the first show. Most of the shows on cable are re-runs.I think the show is humorous and the characters work well together.

0452273331|3.0|I was a bit disappointed. Not nearly as good a read as Atlas Shrugged, but I still like her works and philosophy.
B007REV4YI|5.0|In Skyfall, Sam Mendes does for James Bond what Christopher Nolan did for The Dark Knight Trilogy... where Sam uses Batman Begins to set up the wonderfully successful Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises sequels.<br /><br />In so many ways Skyfall is the BEST BOND MOVIE EVER. I enjoyed the action over the last 50 years but Bond has the potential for very deep background and character development. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with many of the bang bang, explosive bonds of past glory. But this is a thinking man's Bond, mirroring a considerably more sophisticated world, and more effort went into plot development than on any previous movie in the series.<br /><br />Haven't you ever wondered where Bond came from, how he was orphaned, why he is who he is? And M's character is so much more approachable now. In a world where stateless terrorism has taken the place of the old world order, it takes a very special person to be able to run Mi6.<br /><br />Don't you like how they merged the old with the new. That Aston Martin DB5 was beautiful and I love the connection of how it was saved all these years to ultimately become Bond's savior in Skyfall. With all of its gizmos, it was the Aston's armored steel and machine guns that contrasted with modern cloak and dagger. They don't make spy cars like that anymore. I also loved Skyfall's plot, cinematography, their alternate use of color and night to set the moods.<br /><br />Unlike ARGO, the suspense in Skyfall was amazing. You never could have guessed that Skyfall would end with a NEW beginning.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Havent watched it yet but am looking forward to it.  Product came on time exactly as described.  I am very pleased<br />with the service.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|I must admit that I don't get all the excitement for Argo.  This movie is boringly slow, there's no suspense, no plot, and you know how this will end.  There's a part in the movie where the camera pans from one face to the next and back again, slowly, painfully, agonizingly painfully, you begin to question, is this all there is?  I thought Skyfall was a million times better, and it didn't even get a nod from the Academy.  Favoritism is well in play in Hollywood.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Terrifically addicting and fun game! Just remember you don't need any in app purchases! Everything can be unlocked, even the expansions. This Imo makes the game just that much better. It allows you to work towards a goal. The expansions such as neurax play very differently from all the base plagues. You unlock it by beating every base plague on brutal.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Exciting and suspenseful.  Thoroughly enjoyed the unexpected twists as the story developed.  Gillian Flynn is a great author, looking forward to more from her.
B00AYB20KI|5.0|I loved, loved it, keep me guessing and jumping from scene to scene.  I have suggested this movies to friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series!! The acting is wonderful and there’s always a surprising element to the story line. It’s hard turn it off and not to watch the whole series in a Downton Abbey marathon!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I have seen it  20 times and will watch it  many many times.  Great story with a great cast! Best western EVER! If per chance you have not seen this it is a MUST see.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest. It is fun to see new ideas and crafts. I also enjoy the recipes and home decorating ideas.
0307269752|5.0|I had the paper back trilogy and loaned it out.  I wanted the had back set . I bought the 2nd and 3rd elsewhere but they did not have the first one. I have already read them all again. AWESOME!!!!
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I think this is a wonderful movie, great quality, excellent soundtrack, amazing cinematography and thrilling plot. I highly recommend it
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is a good time killer for people who like puzzles but cant have them out due to space or littlest ones trying to get the pieces
B000AYEL6U|5.0|There are more scenes in the dvd version than in the netflix version! Tons of stuff that is from the book and minor yes, but still... more stuff to watch!  Also, just a GREAT period drama/romance.
0143119680|5.0|I absolutely love this book and would recommend it to anyone. It gives a great spin on the obsession with witches and vampires in an interesting and thrilling story. The inclusion of nerdy historical details adds to the interest. I anxiously awaited the release of the second and cannot wait for the third to come out!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|fun to play. I have never had my own horse but this is close enough. I enjoy this game quite a bit.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|even though this book has some rough and parts which are hard to read, the overall emotion the reader is left with is love.  The effects we can have on each other and our enjoyment of life are emphasized in this book.  The power of small acts of kindness.
B005HSL626|3.0|Well it is a good game and I like it but it gets extremely boring after about five minutes so I do not recommend you getting the paid or free version unless you are the kind of person who doesn't get bored easily:(
B0083Z614S|5.0|The secret garden is a classic for a reason. The author weaves a story that involves your heart and soul. The story of two sad and lonely children who find happiness and renewed spirit, it captivated me since I was a child. A short and easy read, the secret garden is full of wisdom, feeling and love. You'll enjoy it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is pretty good  for mahjong beginner players. I enjoyed it but could be a little more challenging, but for the price it's worth it.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Such a great movie! I love that there's no prince, no princess and everyone looks so healthy! I highly recommend this movie
B0039OC64M|1.0|extremely boring.  nudity with no purpose. Plot line could not be followed. Did not like it at all. Pan. Pan.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I remember this as a young guy, this was a big deal when it went down, the movie is a good watch.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|It's an excellent CD made directly from the movie soundtrack. If you liked the movie you will like this CD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best show and its wonderful to watch it when you are comfortable in bed or in the middle of the night...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|That book was so good I finished it in less than a week (and that was not a short book)! I can't wait to get the next book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game does have natural motion.  Very easy and fun to care for the horse. Worth download and great for killing time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book!  I can't wait until the next one comes out.  Sylvia Day is awesome!  Buy it, you won't be disapointed.  Incredible love scenes, very sexy.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  Pre-ordered back in January and have been waiting for this to arrive ever since.  Cannot wait to watch it tonight and I simply adore the hopping eggs.  Very cute!
B00846REIS|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite books.  I didn't want to put it down.  Very sexy love scenes, great characters, drama, funny, sad, love, everything!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|An intriguing story where the past catches up with the protagonist and the woman he both helps and suspects of murder.  The ending is both satisfying and unsettling.  A good read!
1449410243|4.0|This book is hilarious! Its super funny and makes me laugh all the time. But I was kind of disappointed that if you look inside, it gives away most of the chapter of How To Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting To Kill You. But really, this book is really great and I'm pretty sure that anybody/everybody would enjoy it. Keep it coming, Oatmeal! Your site and products are amazing!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I just absolutely love this workout - 25 minutes - full body with weights mixed in . . . you cannot beat it!!!  I tell everybody who will listen that if you want to tone up and drop some weight (whether it be 15 or 150 pounds) this is the DVD for you!  Don't ge me wrong, you are constantly moving and it will kick you butt for that 25 minutes!!  It's the only workout video that I actually looked forward to doing every morning at 6 am and felt extremely guilty for missing it (Lord knows, I have plenty to chose from).  I've been sidelined for a while now and have to work my back up to it but being able to do this workout again is my motivation and I cannot wait until I can!!!! Let me say again:  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I am a fan of Bowies from way back. There is no question he peaked awhile ago, but this new album definitely vindicates his return to pop culture. No, it isn't perfect - this is not the Ziggy Stardust era after all. But then again, it would be almost impossible for any musician to return to those heights after so long.<br /><br />It's a great album and well worth the money to buy and time to listen to. There are a few gens on it... My personal favorite is (for whatever reason) \\"How does the grass grow?\\" but everyone will probably have different favorite bits.
1616550414|5.0|Beautifully bound, written and illustrated.  Any Zelda fan will love this official informative book produced by its creators.  Highly recommended.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I love this movie.  It is weird and wonderful.  I haven't watched this disc yet, but if there is anything wrong, I will let you know.  Thanks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey really came into its own with season 3 with some shockings twists and turns.<br /><br />Although the season finale left me with a somewhat empty feeling inside, it makes for good viewing. Characters are developing well and as always the Dowager delivers with her quick quips and witty remarks.<br /><br />A delight to watch and as the show continues to highlight the challenges that the pre-war society faced when adjusting to the post-war world.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories.  The characters are so moving that I watch it over and over.  Thanks.

B000HEWEEE|5.0|I enjoy this movie with it's twists and turns.  The movie came in a timely fashion and I have watched it.  The disc is as good as advertised.  Thanks.
B00846REIS|4.0|I read all the hype about Christian Gray and Anastasia Steele.  I decided to read the trilogy.  It was a great series with some twists and turns and the explicit romantic scenes.  After the trilogy, I was  searching for something similar and came across the \\"Crossfire Trilogy\\". Not knowing what to expect, I find this series more 'edge of your seat'.  Gideon Crossfire is much more wealthier and he is much more tormented.  This series is different in that there is more happening than just the bedroom scenes.  I can't wait for the 3rd installment in June.
034580404X|5.0|I know I need to read these books, but I just haven't had the time.  I bought them because everybody was talking about them.  Maybe one day I'll get the time.  Thanks.
B00B780TAK|5.0|Just finished the third season and it has set the bar even higher for next season. This is a great television series that is unlike any other show I normally watch. I have just recently started watching British TV shows, but none have been as good as this. Can't wait until next season.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I am very excited to say that this is one of my favorite shows.  I was so glad to be able to watch it at home.  Thanks.
B006VA57CY|5.0|This show rocks. I advise anyone who enjoys great television and acting to give this show a try. You won't be disappointed.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|How could I not love this show.  Charlie Hunnam gives me everything I could want in a biker without going to jail.  Thanks.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|When this project was announced, the general public, the critics and even the actors in the film were wondering if something could be done in these modern times to give respect to the original MGM classic \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" as well as Frank L. Baum original children stories but Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead) did a respectable version of the story BEFORE Dorothy and her magical friends seek the Wizard of Oz themselves.<br /><br />With a pleasantly crafted screenplay, written by Mitchell Kapner ( The Whole Nin Yards, Days of Wrath) and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rise of the Guardians, Inkheart), Raimi did an excellent job with the visuals and style of the film. From the make-up to the sets, the film is literally visual eye candy. Not to mention the fantastic Danny Elfman (Beetljuice, Batman) score which only adds to the wonderment of the film.<br /><br />The story begins long before Dorothy ever makes it to Oz with Oscar (the Wizard to be) played wonderfully by James Franco (127 Hours, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) who does a fantastic job at playing a conman with a really big heart. He doesn't show the positive side of himself, but appears to be nothing more than a swindling con artist with nothing more that money and women on his immediate agenda.<br /><br />Mila Kunis (Black Swan, That 70's Show) plays Theodora the sister of the `west' (wink, wink) who actually meets and falls in love with Oscar. Her innocence and performance are sincere and honest and when she becomes the icon that everyone has either seen or knows of, Mila really shines as the alter ego she nastily becomes. (I'll give you a hint, she turns green, fly's around on a household cleaning utensil and wears a very distinctive hat!)<br /><br />Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Constantine) does an amazing job as Theodora's sister Evanora who also does a wonderful job of miss direction in the film. Not only does she motivate two characters to the point of making major changes in The Land of Oz, but she gives her sister something she (and us as the audience) will never forget!<br /><br />Now you have to add the goodness and sincerity in the film, and mix it with another miss direction again, this time you have the `Good Witch\\" Gilinda played wonderfully by Michelle Williams (Shutter Isalnd, Dawson's Creek). Her amazing wisdom, trust and heart are what guide, motivate and eventually mature our con man (James Franco or Oscar or Oz) into become the `Wonderful Wizard' he will be. (She also plays another role that I will tell you has a direct connection to Dorothy Gale.)<br /><br />I must give a special nod to Zach Braff (Scrubs, Chicken Little) who is a bumbling assistant to Oscar in the black and white sequence but becomes more than a friend to Oz himself when they are paired up in the Magical Kingdom quite by accident. Zach's voice is that of Finely a not so bright, but loveable,  bellhop dressed chimpanzee/monkey who flies. So much heart and warmth go into their relationship you'll believe what you see.<br /><br />Another real and passionate performance comes from a small on screen appearance as a different character but later as a much larger voice over for a wonderful character known as `The China Doll'.  Joey king (Crazy, Stupid, Love, Ice Age 3) gives a marvelous vocal performance with much empathy as a China Doll who lost her family. Tony Cox (SW Return of the Jedi, Bad Santa) also makes a wonderful jaunt as a disgruntled munchkin as does Bill Cobbs (Night At The Museum, The Bodyguard) who players the Head Tinker and gives Oz exactly what he needs!<br /><br />What was sweet is they made references to characters and places from the original film and kept the color and vibrancy of the original. \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is still the classic and nothing will probably ever be able to hold a candle to it, however this is a nice side-dish to the legend that Frank L. Baum created in his famous children's books.<br /><br />There is a section where it seems a little too much visuals,butterflies, creatures, water and fauna, but once you get passed that, the story and characters come alive and really make you believe what Dorothy had no idea she would be up against in the next cinematic adventure. I love the stylistic black and white beginning of the film and the concept of the small screen being portrayed in the first 15 minutes, but when it opens to wide screen and in full amazing cinematic color, it becomes a fun film with surprises and scares where you least expect them. It might scare really small children but fans of the original classic film, and new fans, should come and hopefully will really enjoy the characters and story that is \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\".butterflies, creatures, water and fauna, but once you get passed that, the story and characters come alive and really make you believe what Dorothy had no idea she would be up against in the next cinematic adventure.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I haven't even gotten this movie yet.  What can I say?  I saw it on the tv and I enjoyed the movie.  Why not ask me again after I get the movie.
B005DN5BE4|3.0|This film is a nice Hallmark card of a movie, which is to say it bears the strong imprint of Spielberg. It is based on actual events but is not annoyed with facts. That some of the attorneys abandoned the case because there was no pay, and that this was one of the main prompts for the remaining attorneys to ask Adams to join the team, this is ignored. Instead, a composite character attorney is misunderstood by one of the defendants and rejected. Also, the fact that one of the defendants,Sengbe Pieh (later known in the United States as Joseph Cinqué), learned enough English in jail to write a moving plea to Adams for assistance is totally ignored. President Van Buren is played too comically stupid to be taken seriously as a real person, although the character suffices as a mere plot device.<br /><br />So it goes, the very basic facts are there and it's an enjoyable film--just don't cite it as historical reference.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I'll admit that the start of the book had me confused  with all of the jumping around between people and timeframes, but it didn't take long for me to be totally engrossed in Cathy's story. This was a fantastic read!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|At last! A medical viewpoint of the afterlife and written convincingly by a neurosurgeon who knows all about brain function, brain death and scientific explanatoins of NDFwho actually experienced a complete lock down of his higher cortical functions for a week.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I liked the writing style and the background story.  I just didn't share the passion enough to appreciate the physical hardship endured --had a bit of a hard time staying with her through the physical pain.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Breath taking!  I waited seemingly forever for season 2 to come out and watched the entire set over the weekend that it arrived at my home.  I will find it frustrating to have to wait for season 3 (I don't have cable) to grace my shelves.
B009CPES4I|3.0|DO not read too much into it. I have been to India and hotels theer are outstanding !!<br />Would recommend if you were getting bored to wits..
B008JFUNAU|4.0|In book form, the marvelous land of Oz, like many fantasy worlds designed to appeal to children, is long on magic and short on sex.  In the books, L. Frank Baum takes pains to emphasize that in Oz, you can be just what age you want to be, and Ozma, Glinda, Dorothy, etc. prefer to stay kids.  Unlike Harry Potter, they sidestep puberty; however, in the latest \\"Oz,\\" movie, the witches are hot to trot, and lust exists alongside childlike wonder (an uneasy combo at best).  Imagine \\"Oz\\" as a CGI-heavy Sweet Valley High complete with mean girls, nice girls and a guy who really isn't worth all the fighting over him, and you have \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful.\\"<br /><br />So would this version make Baum gyrate in his grave?  Well, if the seriously traumatic \\"Return to Oz,\\" hadn't already given him a workout back in 1985, I'd say yes, but in comparison \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful,\\" is pretty tame.  James Franco plays Oscar Diggs, a compulsive liar, ladies' man and showman, who travels with a Kansas circus circa 1900.  In order to avoid the consequences of his actions, he hops a hot air balloon and crashes in Oz, where he is believed to be the long-awaited savior who can defeat the \\"Wicked\\" Witch  (really Michelle Williams, who is blond, angelic and looks as if she's just swallowed a lemon) and rule Oz.  In reality, Michelle is the Good Witch, and the two sisters who rule the Emerald City (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis) are Evil (they`re brunette, see).  Oz doesn't have any genuine magic, but he sure knows how to put on a show, and will this be enough for good to triumph?  That's a tough one, folks.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, though. Franco comes off like an amiable big brother who's been coerced into taking part in his kid sisters' play, and the supporting cast does a decent job with a so-so script. The effects are truly - magical?  Well, more or less.  By the way, here's an idea for the sequel.  Back in Kansas, Franco is incarcerated in a mental hospital and threatened witha lobotomy if he doesn't stop prattling about Oz.  Then he hears a knock, and in comes a hot blonde nurse who looks familiar - and helps him escape. Well, maybe we don't need to equate imagination with mental illness again and scar another generation of kids. Let's hope not anyway.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|kept breaking the flow of the story switching between realistic images and the more imaginary theatrical. Acting suffered as they could not easily work from one to the other.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|true talent right here! Love this album! Have a listen and I am sure you will agree. Looking for more from this artist.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|The movie kept my  interest throught out, loved the end. The movie has great Cinematography and Speical effects. A good movie to watch to round out your Oscar viewing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is probably my favorote app of all time. This provides hours of gameplay and has expansion packs at a very reasonable price if you enjoy it as much as I did. As suggested by my title, this app is great in any situation: I most frequently use it before I go to sleep (since it is very focusing and relaxing) but it is also great for travel or whenever you want to give your brain a little exercise. If you like this make sure to try Flow Free: Bridges for even more levels. Really the only problem with this game is that they don't have enough levels!
B0077EBWVI|3.0|It was an ok version, The original was much better. The part of Ren was disappointing. Dance sequence of Ren in factory was terrible.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch follows a murder from 1992 during the LA riots to the present. His victim, nicknamed Snow White, is brutally murdered and then forgotten by all except Bosch. Very well written with historical fact thrown in with the fiction. This book keeps you reading well past your bedtime.
B005H9B44A|4.0|It held my attention but just barely.  I thought there would be more action.  Main character did a good job.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|This story starts out slow, but builds up to an unbelievable experience sequence of survival under trying circumstances.  Reminds me of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"... fantasy or reality, or a combination of. ,both?  Metaphors?  Allegories?  All of these?  One must think for awhile of what is real, what is not, and what an experience of survival might do to a person under such trying circumstances.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|it would be nice if you could actually grab from  other player feeds and share gifts easier from the app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another wonderful book from him. Read the whole book in about four hours.  Recommend to everyone, especially anyone who has enjoyed his prior books. Excited to see the movie.
B004NELBPC|3.0|I like huffington however it has many issues with loading stories, even on computer it drags. when you go to load a new story it take so much time and freezes
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This Bond depiction was lively and entertaining, but seemed a little disjointed and hard to follow, and not as flowing as it could have been.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I first got this game/puzzle it was just too simple and I lost interest until I got to the higher levels then it became really challenging (and fun) I have lost entire hours playing this. I cannot get enough! Some take lots of thought, when I complete the entire thing I believe I will start all over and it will be like the first time seeing each board. I cannot say enough good things about this ( I have bridges to tackle when I am done with this) GET THIS you will love it!!!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This movie will never lose its charm and message.  Hanks was phenomenal and completely believable with his portrayal and of course Dennis Senise as Lt. Dan will always be one of the great ones.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I know these games all have the same concept, but I find it addicting. I keep purchasing after the demo.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hated the season ending but in love with this show - cannot wait for season 4 to begin!!! Sad that so many characters will be missing.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Makes you think!!! Great Sci Fi effects would watch again!!!!!!!!! I hope there is a sequel!!!! Amazon  great pic quality
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I came into this movie with an already bias opinion. I am a fan of the Orson Wells version and always will be, but I was happily surprised at this movie. Though I wish that Jane's life at Lowood School would have had more screen time,  as I feel that her time spent there really helped to understand her character later in the movie. The only problem I had with Jane Eyre in this movie is that she reminded me more of Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice than Jane Eyre of the book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is a really good read, especially on a gloomy day.  It keeps you totally engaged.  Take the trip and enjoy
B0041KVW2K|5.0|200 grain records is the only way to go!<br />I have the original vinyl Beatle albums and the quality is not the same, I have vintage stereo equipment and the 200 grain makes the originals sound pale in comparison.makes me want to replace all my records with 200 grain!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This was a good movie when we rented it we watched it 3 times. It's nice to finally own it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Or a sequel. Ok Stephen King. I liked it. Wording was kinda dated. I would like to know exactly what the car really was.
B005LAIISA|5.0|The Ice Age movies are great! Our whole family loves them and we have them all. Keep making them for us!
B002JODPSO|5.0|If you want an action movie  with stunts that defy both logic and the laws of physics, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is just what you are looking for. However, the subject matter of cyber-terrorism is a topic that wil give you something to think about long  after you finish the film.<br /><br />The villain in DIE HARD IV used to be a high-ranking  government official who, after 9-11, was ignored by  our leaders at the top who did not want to hear his warning about American vulnerability to cyber-terrorism. This film will leave you wondering if the villain is based on a real person who was ignored by Washinton leaders because they didn't like his messge.<br /><br />I can't help thinking about how, in August 2001, the Bush White House was warned about terrorist attacks using airplanes as missiles.  The warning went unheeded, leading to the deadliest attack on our nation in our history.<br /><br />Maybe the producers of LIVE FREE OR DIE are trying to tell us something before it's too late. A serious message may very well lie underneath all the jaw-dropping stunts in what many people see as a frivilous action movie.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|just need something for kindle fire for wife .  she likes to read books and this was best way for her
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this game. Just wish the hidden object parts would get a little bigger. Hard to find the things when you don't see very well. Otherwise it was just my speed with just the right amount of navigating between areas and several hidden object areas. Great for people who don't want to get too deep into strange stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game I suggest this game it's amazing :)<br /><br />1 word to describe this game<br />  AWESOME!!!!!!<br />Really fun!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is so cool! There are so many things to create! I love it! Element combonation is cool. I think it would be neat if you could combine more than two elements at once.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is scary, like Slenderman for the pc, only worse because it's on a small touch screen that just isn't the same as a mouse!  Slendy still pops up and freaks you out as usual.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This thing is amazing. I use to along with my 60D for shooting videos. Simply amazing. Great audio quality and very easy to use.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fantastic graphics and smooth game play. Highly recommend!! Took a little while to get used to the tilt steering on the Kindle Fire but once I adjusted it just made it that more fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is a very enjoyable game to play. It is hard to put the game down and it is lots of fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an awesome game for kids and I love it.the game is so much like temple run accept without the little monsters following you.you have a security guard and his dog.I love it and I will continue to play intolerant it gets old.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Purchased the hi-def version on my blu-ray from amazon as an instant video. Wanted my wife to see it because I have the SG1 tv DVDs which I want her to see also. My first time to watch it in hi-def (all I have is the VHS version) and it is so much better.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|DVD's arrived in perfect condition and within the time frame stated.  These are a gift for my daughter's birthday.  We both LOVE the show, and now we can enjoy the series second season as often as we enjoy the first.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|boring, got it because it was the free app of the day and thought it looked like monkeyball.  It's not monkeyball, the controls suck, and the game is just boring.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This is a good movie with a solid performance from Denzel Washington, playing a strong, heroic character with strong, reprehensible flaws.  Good script, nice cinematography and well acted.  Warning: You may not want to be holding hands with your date during the flight scenes!
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Good functional, easy to use and lot of options to make it act like whatever calculator you're used to using.  You probably don't want this if you just need to do basic math, but I use my head for that and this calc is quite handy for me.
0321885112|5.0|Five stars twice. Very clear, good impression, excellent content. More than a step by step method to make sketchnotes is a very useful tool for anyone who wants to communicate visually. Well done Michel!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Since I really enjoying the Frank Bascombe triolgy, I was looking forward to Richard Ford's latest book.  However, it was big disappointment.  Although the writing was generally well done, the main character, Del Parson, was not sympathetic---in fact he was so passive that I almost did not finish the book.  Part 1 set in Great Falls, Montana introduces Del's parents and his sister - each with issues to be explored. However, all but Del are effectively \\"killed off\\" and play only a small part in the rest of the book.  Part 2 is a deadly long and slow telling of Del's time in a small town in Saskachewan,Canada. I found this section strange and unsatisfying. Part 3 is  a short section told by Del in old age. After his years in the prairie town, he attends university and ends up teaching at a high school near Windsor, Ontario. All in all I cannot recommend this book-- not same as earlier books by Ford.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|A great addition to the Underword series. Plenty of action and world class special effects. I can't wait for the next one
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This is without doubt one of the best films based on  historical events. I still cannot understand people who put down a movie because it may not be entirely factual. It's a movie folks not a historical document. Dah,  if you want history go to the library not the movies.  Too many of us are just to lazy to research history and prefer to have it spoon fed to us by the movies.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed the Secret Keeper. The plot was enjoyable and the ending caught me by surprise!  I've enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie even though you knew the outcome of the event it was still intriguing.  I am so glad to see Ben Affleck get the recognition I think he has deserved for a long time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the display - great sized pictures and easy to scroll for info.  Also can access same info as found on the computer version.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I ordered this book on the advice of my guitar teacher, as he told me it could help me overcome some obstacles (resistance) to my learning.  The book was an easy read, and I'm actually reading it for a second time now.  I found it very inspirational and motivational, not only in terms of my music, but moreover as a new perspective on my professional career (I'm not a musician) and for everyday life in general.  Excellent!!
B00992CF6W|2.0|its good if u don't have a laptop but u have a aneroid buy it for onyx 6.99 lololololololololol<br />not the best ger but guud
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of Zep's most popular songs, but I was hesitant because I was skeptical as to the quality of the live performance.  I was soooo wrong!!  These guys are better now than they were in their &#34;prime!&#34;  Excellent sound quality, and inspirational and moving performance!!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is my first foray into the world of fixed blade, and I am quite pleased. I personally love the finish, and don't plan on stripping it, as many do. It took a while to get a good, even edge on the blade, and probably will take a few more sessions at the sharpening station to get a uniform angle along the length of the blade. That was a minor turn off, the variation in the edge angle along the length of the blade from the factory, but one I can fix easily enough. Heavy, heavy duty, I have no fears about damaging this knife anytime soon, and the full tang that extends past the base of the grips is a nice feature for pounding and whatnot. Looking forward to a good, long relationship with this knife.
B0091VTISO|4.0|I didn't think I would like Momoa as Conan but this movie was done well and surprised me as I enjoyed this action packed barbarian movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book.  Can't wait to start the second book to see what happens with Ana.  I hope in a way they get together.
B007M45PMU|3.0|I bought the album for Ho Hey.  I was initially a littl disappointed in the tone of the rest of the album, but after listening to it more I found it kind of grows on you.  Worth the $5 price.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Building Your Book for Kindle gives great hints and recommendations for publishing your book.  Kindle offers an alternative to traditional publishing and up front costs.  I am working on my book.  I won't be a professional writer, but what I do is important to me.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|So many hits on this album...absolutely love it.  It has become my go to album for up beat, sing-along tracks.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|I thought this movie was well done and did a good job of character development. I will be watching this movie many times over the years.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was fun and very Imaginative  as any and eyerykind of sweet treat as a backround drop. Well written, great jokes and the best characters ever! this movie will leave you laughing and feeling good!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie reminded me of why I love Bond. I thought it was extremely well done, and may in fact be my favorite of the Bond movies. Excellent job furthering the plot and tying in the things we are familiar with when it comes to these, and still keeping it fresh and new.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great series! Can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out... although they are already changing the plot. Definitely a good read.. lots of metaphors and subtle underlying meanings.
0547564651|5.0|This is a good book to take notes on. It contains many thought provoking ideas. A must read for anyone concerned with children, education and our future.
B00899F0G8|5.0|You have to know the backstory to love this show to the fullest... but once you get sucked in, you'll be hooked. A constant battle with an anonymous enemy draws me every season to learn more about who and why and how they are going to stop it..
B000001ZS3|4.0|This was a fun one to listen to.  Anything like this is always grouped in with Tangerine Dream and Vangelis, whose music I'm a lot more familiar with, but this album doesn't really show the discipline of those artists.  On the other hand, some of the kooky changes and beats really made me smile, which is something TD and Vangelis rarely do.  There are a lot of really cool rhythms and things going on, but it seems like he's doing too much stuff at once and they all kind of step on each other in parts, like you're listening to 2 or 3 electronic albums at once.  These things all add up to create a great sense of tension & release throughout the course of the whole album though, so there are a lot of double edged aspects of this album.  Overall it's thought provoking and challenging, while being fun and loose, which is pretty hard to do!  I'm sure to listen to it again and again.
B007THA4FI|2.0|No one can paint a picture with words like j k Rowling. That being said I found this book pointless and boring. I did not like the characters or care what happened to them. I struggled to finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very nice game and very enjoyable. . This gamesl is very fun because of the different.countries you run In and such
1616550414|5.0|Previously, I used to scavenge around the internet for this kind of information so it's nice to have a nice solid book with beautiful artwork and all the prestige of being backed officially by Nintendo handy for those burning (and often random) questions about Hyrule.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|My daughter ordered this Lifeproof case and broke within 4 uses. I called the manufacturer to return/report the defective product only to find this is a counterfeit product by the serial #'s that are pasted to it. Now that I look at product itself I see the whole thing is a joke. It will NOT keep your phone protected or waterproof! I have reported this to Amazon and they were kind enough to credit the purchase.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Lep's World 2 is a shameless Super Mario clone. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. After all, the iPhone has a vast and huge library of lots of games, yet it's not like Nintendo will ever contribute to it. So why not have Lep's World come in and fill that Mario gap?<br /><br />The levels totally scream \\"MARIO\\", as this little leprechaun is busy bouncing on enemies, bashing bricks, and gathering coins. That said, the level design and gameplay are pretty rad, since Mario is one of the best platforming experiences around. However, I wish there was a little more enemy variety, as well as more power-ups other than being able to shoot.<br /><br />I disliked the first Lep's World because it was really just a demo for a \\"Plus\\" version. Basically, false advertising. That's not the case with Lep's World 2, fortunately. It's a quality Mario knockoff for smartphones.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It was riveting from the first page. I loved the power of the characters. I give this 4.75 star rating if I knew how to do the .75 (Lol). Well done!! Can't wait for more, Sylvia!
B0000E5SLG|5.0|great cd, not one bad song. I would recomend it highly to friends and anyone who likes great upbeat music.
B00846REIS|4.0|I wish I knew how to get the .75 because I would so give it a 4.75 rating. It was sexy as hell and intriguing, mingled with a bit of suspense. Great storyline. I fell in love with the main characters right away. Well DONE, Sylvia!! I can't wait for more!
1423136802|5.0|When I saw the movie I thought that it was outstanding and i fell in love with Percy &#60;3 but, Now that I've read the books I realize... The movie was Crap! The Movie deprived the viewers of so much information and really didn't follow the story line of Percy Jackson.  The movie could have been it's own series because of how different it is compared to the books.  Percy and his friends go through amazing adventures that kept my heart pounding and me on the edge of my seat! I would MOST DEFINITELY recommend this book to everyone! These books feed my addiction for mythology, adventure, excitement, and complicated romance.  Everyone should read these books or they would be excluded from another world, that I lost myself in. :)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase. I now can attend Hogwarts whenever it is convenient for me. Expecto Patronum!

0375822070|5.0|I read The Fantastic Mr. Fox to my children when they were little and now I have just had the pleasure of reading this lovely story to my 6-year old granddaughter.  What a pleasure.  She enjoyed it just as much as my own kids did, and it is still fun for me to read it over and over again.  It is my favorite Roald Dahl book--and that is saying something!
B00003CXPD|5.0|love the movie. great product. highly recommended.inspiring, entertaining. great date movie. brush up on your English. Your Northern England English that is.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It was a good extension of the Scarpetta series. Not quite as compelling as some have been, but it may be familiarity. Some how in did not seem quite as developed. But I enjoyed it.
B00007G207|5.0|really love this movie. the director's cut is SOOOOO worth the extra time. a different movie with the additional time. a must see for fans of the original.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Have always enjoyed George Michael's music.  However, this 2-disc CD is one great song after the other.  It showcases his vocal ability and talent to the point where you find yourself looking forward to the next song, even if it's an unfamiliar.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Completely addictive...season 2 was a bit more &#34;peckinpaw&#34; esque....one DVD left both me and my husband so nauseous and disturbed...we had to watch and &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; dvd to chill out afterwards.....WOW...very powerful....<br />Can't afford $$$ cable...less expensive to have the DVD's and can enjoy forever and share!

B00BN2CY7G|2.0|This is so far a way from Rock & Roll.  Bon Jovi has strayed so far from their roots.  I can't believe I keep looking for a Rock album from Bon Jovi.  Everyone compare this album to \\"7800 Degrees Fahrenheit\\" and tell me if you disagree.  blah, blah, blah, no need to reply with your \\"they progressed\\" type drivel.  Nice bait and switch, Country Jovi.  Nice first song on your album.... \\"Because we can\\". arrogant blow hards..... my response..... Never again. signed a former Bon Jovi fan........

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm half-kidding, obviously. I read this on one day and couldn't stop. It was so good! At the end, I sort of just entered a complicated emotional state I'm still not over from. I cried. A lot. But also laughed a lot. This book made me so happy inside and then tore me apart. Highly recommended! I hope they don't mess it up when it becomes a movie!

0670026638|5.0|It's not often a book gets me excited about reading it as soon as I open it, but that's what happened with A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki. Right away, in the first few pages, readers are treated to a unique, young voice. Naoko is contemplative, wiser than she realizes, and speaks without tempering her words. She displays a very stark self-awareness which often caused me to catch my breath.<br /><br />This novel has so many intricate layers, I know I can't do it justice in this review. A colleague of mine once told me he always loves listening to, performing, and conducting Beethoven's 5th Symphony, even though he's done so countless times. For him, it never gets old or stale. He always hears something new, notices something that gives it even more depth and meaning. I can imagine reading A Tale for the Time Being again and again and having this same reaction.<br /><br />In a way, I think Naoko exemplifies the complexity and full freedom of religion in modern Japanese culture. She isn't overtly religious, but she is very open-minded, which allows her to pull the truths and strength she desperately needs. Naoko's time with her great-grandmother Jiko is profoundly beautiful, and the descriptions of Buddhist traditions and ceremonies are absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />Ruth says she \\"wanted to read at the same rate [Naoko] had lived\\" and at times found it difficult to resist the temptation to quickly devour the entire story. I definitely shared that feeling! I found myself getting impatient during the scenes with Ruth and Oliver. I just wanted Ruth to get back to reading Naoko's diary. I had to know what happened next!<br /><br />A Tale for the Time Being will appeal to those who enjoy contemporary fiction, those who enjoy a bit of the fantastic with some magical realism, those who like their fiction to be intertwined with science, philosophy, history, and politics. Marcel Proust is quoted in the book: \\"Every reader, while he is reading, is the reader of his own self.\\" Ozeki explores some thought-provoking angles concerning the importance of the reader to a novel. This novel challenged and stretched my thinking, and I always appreciate that.<br /><br />This was my first time reading any of Ozeki's books, and I am left with the compulsion to go buy everything she's written. I am certain this novel is going to end up listed as one of the best releases of the year.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. I did not receive any other compensation for this review.s own self.\\" Ozeki explores some thought-provoking angles concerning the importance of the reader to a novel.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Don't expect to find out what Pat whispered to Nikki in the movie in this book.  The book actually goes further than the movie and develops these lovable characters deeper and spans a much greater length of time.  The resolution is complete when Pat finds Nikki is married and has two children!  He realizes \\"Nikki on her best day\\" could not come close to Tiffany 's acceptance/love/deep knowledge of him and is his sole mate.  Bravo Matthew Quick...loved each word!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This is a very good David Bowie album, in my view. It's a great relief to say it, because when some of the gods of my youth have returned in...well...late middle age after a long absence the results have not always been very good, to say the least. Here, Bowie shows that he is still a major songwriting and performing talent and that he still has a genuine edge.<br /><br />We have had a little time now to digest the track Where Are We Now? and to assess its true merit now that the \\"Blimey!\\" factor following its surprise release has worn off a bit. I still think that it's a very good song indeed. I did worry that some of the fragile, almost-out-of-tune vocal wasn't a deliberate effect but the voice of a man who can't quite sing as he used to, but - thank heavens - I was quite wrong. It is followed on the album by Valentine's Day, a track which wouldn't have been out of place on Aladdin Sane and which Bowie sings superbly, and there's plenty of other evidence here that he's still got it.<br /><br />The songs seem to me to be vintage Bowie. There is the full gamut from singable, rocky tunes like Valentine's Day, through lovely tender songs like Where Are We Now? to the almost tuneless and weird-rhythmed If You Can See Me, with plenty in between. He certainly hasn't settled into a comfortable rut in middle age - If You Can See Me has joined my list of Almost Unlistenable Bowie Tracks and I'm delighted to see that he is still prepared to challenge and unsettle his audience even if personally I don't like the result.<br /><br />The lyrics, of course, are complex, allusive and often elusive. As always, you can try to analyse what they \\"really\\" mean, but I've never found that a very productive way of approaching Bowie because I suspect that, as many poets have, he often puts together words for their sound or effect without them having any \\"true meaning.\\" I love his lyrics and I often just enjoy the evocative sound of phrases like this in Dirty Boys: \\"When the sun goes down/And the die is cast...\\" and let my imagination do the rest. Similarly, in The Stars, we get things like, \\"There they are upon the stairs/Sexless and unaroused...\\" which makes little literal sense in the context but it's an amazingly arresting lyric which sparks off all sorts of mental images and thoughts - which is what good lyrics should do.<br /><br />I really like this album. The production is excellent; it is varied and sensitive and shows every song off at its best. It will take a while before it is clear whether or not it is a true Bowie classic. My sense is that it's probably not quite a classic, but it's a very good album indeed and warmly recommended.nd the die is cast...\\" and let my imagination do the rest.

B00B23O96A|3.0|For getting on for five decades now I have been firmly of the belief that Eric Clapton is a major deity, and seeing him in concert remains a highlight of my musical life, so I say this through clenched teeth and with great sadness: this album isn't very good. I thoroughly disliked it on first hearing, but I have made myself listen to it several more times to see whether I was missing something. It did get a bit better on repeated listening, being salvaged to an extent by some of Eric's guitar work (of course it is) but overall I think it's distressingly feeble.<br /><br />The songs are largely covers and reworkings of standards. Now, Clapton has often been able to bring something exceptional to older, sometimes very familiar songs; the blues material goes without saying, but Swing Low Sweet Chariot, Cocaine and the stunning live version of Can't Find My Way Home on E.C Was Here, just to take three random examples, show the brilliance he is capable of in a wide variety of styles. Here, there is (to me, anyway) a slick but slightly empty, cocktail lounge feel to songs like The Folks Who Live On the Hill and Goodnight Irene and I can find very little real heart or genuine emotional content anywhere.<br /><br />Every Little Thing rather typifies the album for me. It begins very well with a solid riff from the band and some really good vocals from Eric, but it stumbles between styles, doesn't really go anywhere and ends up with - get this - a choir of very young, lisping, slightly-out-of-tune children singing \\"Every little thing you do is beautiful...\\" It's twee, sickly, manipulative and musically vacuous - and it's on an Eric Clapton album, for heavens' sake! The whole album seems to me to have an insincere, corporate gloss over it which is a world away from the depth and passion of Eric's best work. Even the reggae arrangements which he has done so brilliantly in the past sound pretty middle-of-the-road and lack any real bite.<br /><br />Of course there are some fine solos from Eric, including some great bottleneck work, and he still has that incomparable touch and the ability to improvise a miniature work of genius. The trouble is, it's all but swamped by its desperately disappointing context. There is a stellar cast of guests here, but even JJ Cale, another of my greatest heroes, can't really lift Angel much above the ordinary, and I leave you to make up your own mind about what the presence of Paul McCartney might imply for the style of the music.<br /><br />I am genuinely very sad to have to say this about an album by a man whose work I have so admired and who has meant so much to me for so long. I have given it three stars because of the guitar work and partly, to be honest, because I couldn't bring myself to give EC any less, but I can't really recommend it.olos from Eric, including some great bottleneck work, and he still has that incomparable touch and the ability to improvise a miniature work of genius.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This was a documentary based on love. A love of friends, family, musicians, and the process of making those people happy. Never got the nostalgia vibe. The console was always there. Even after growing up in a family of financial analysts, I feel like I should be picking up a guitar. Grohl, you  did a masterful job on this film.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We cannot stop watching this series. The setting, the timeframe in history, the costumes, the cultured, clipped British inflections, the simple humanity of each and every character in the household is wonderful.  This is a story we don't want to see end.  Ever.

B00BESLHEA|2.0|So i knew quentin had just put his name on here and had no creative part in this film but i thought he would at least have some standards of what he will claim and what he won't.  Some of my complaints about this movie are 1.  The music just did not match the scenes, i for one am not a big rap/hip hop fan yet do respect the wu-tang and RZA and even somewhat liked some of the hip-hop asian beats in the movie but it was the other parts that didn't sync up, i felt like i was watching one movie and hearing another and not in the good way like pink floyd and the wizard of oz, it was like pseudo- ennio morrocone-esque spaghetti western mixed with a night at the club on too much special k,  muff cabbage seriously!  2.  Did not understand the ninja guys david bowie 80's hairstyles, i thought this movie was supposed to take place in old times and i do not recall in any history books or pictures with people looking like they just walked off the set of \\"the labyrinth.\\"  3. Terrible cliche plot, zzzzzzzzzzz  4.  they intice you with lucy lui and russel crowe and its a scam because their roles are just cheesier than a Wisconsin deli.  All in all i kinda regret wasting $ on this movie and a little dissapointed in tarentino's recommendation, and would not recommend this movie to really anyone other than the really hardcore RZA fan and thats about it

1401937519|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and the message it brings for us to live and be the creation God made us to be.  Also the great emphasis on love.  God is love and in Him there is no darkness at all.  Being made in His image we can live in that love.<br />I did feel that to say that it didn't matter who we believed in is a deception.<br />Jesus is the only one of those mentioned who is alive today and will come back as King of Kings and Lord of Lords and who died for each one of us that we might have eternal life.  She is right that it isn't about religion but it is about relationship with our Father God who loved us and sent His son to die for us that we might go free and live forever with Him.

B000001GX5|5.0|This disc, mercifully well recorded in the 1970s, at last brings a performance that can stand comparison with the famous one made by Reiner and the CPO in about 1960 and now available in fine SACD format. I refer to the two Roman pieces which are the real meat of this disc. The remaining items are not really in the same class of epic inspiration but are still played here as well as can be imagined.<br /><br />The key defining moment in the Pines and Festivals is the last movement of the Pines. It is crucial that the correct tempo is chosen. This should represent the might of the Roman army marching from a far distance, hazy effects vital here, and probably coming from Egypt (indicative cor anglais solo). From there the piece is all about overlapping swathes of sound building up remorselessly over a steady marching beat. The steady beat is crucial (bass drum). Too fast and it becomes a jolly romp home. Too much detail on the beat within the beat and the same damage is done. Very few conductors can resist the urge for volume and speed for this ending and consequently lessen the impact disastrously. Reiner does it best. Karajan is in the same class though and has the advantage of newer recording. Muti and Pappano are among the others who are most successful with this piece and refuse to hurry.<br /><br />There are, of course, many other key points but none so crucial as the ending. Recorded nightingales are generally well done and so is the distant solo trumpet heard earlier. Karajan is playing to his strengths on this disc. The BPO are pretty well a dream team with this sort of drilled precision and mellifluous playing. That combination is what makes this a fine Roman pairing. The string resources of this orchestra are also shown to good effect in the Boccherini and Albinoni arrangements as well as in the Ancient Airs suite 3.<br /><br />I would suggest that this disc, along with Reiner, Muti and Pappano, is well worth considering for purchase by those wanting an 'only' recording or those interested in comparative recordings.y' recording or those interested in comparative recordings.

I didn't have any live Led Zep albums, so this worked out for me.  This is a pretty good Led Zeppelin collection, with a nice mix of songs.  I prefer the studio recordings, but this isn't bad and you absorb all that raw live energy.<br /><br />But when we went to see Get The Led Out, I enjoyed that concert even better than the album.  If you get a chance to see them, you going to love them.  They are considered the American Led Zeppelin.

The ending is so open, with no real finality that I'm not sure what to think about it.

His music is a part of the very fabric of my life, and while I appreciate his live performances most, these studio albums continue to contain gorgeous arrangements from a variety of musical genres.<br /><br />Stand out tracks from this album include: Still got the blues (one of the best studio blues efforts of his entire career), Gotta get over (straight up rock), the folks who live on the hill (lush and wonderful), and 'til your well runs dry (stunning guitar work, jammin' reggae).<br /><br />This is an album for musicians, and lovers of great arrangements of timeless songs. Although Eric is 67 years old, his music continues to connect with me, and I'm only 27. It's a shame he can't be around forever, because nobody sounds like him and so few musicians have such integrity in the albums they are producing. Eric doesn't feel the need to prove anything, he just uses his gifts to craft wonderful albums filled with fantastic music. Just like in movies, special effects without a story are boring, and in music virtuoso showmanship is boring without being contained in wonderful songs. Eric gets it, and blesses us with his musical wisdom once again with Old Sock.

B000Q76K1A|5.0|I LOVE ALL OF THE BOURNE MOVIES. I WOULD NEVER READ GARBAGE BOOKS LIKE THIS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR BRAIN-- WATCH THIS
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Flight works because its realistic portrayal of a wouldbe hero whose flaws helps the audience identify with alcoholism and one's ability to function in society.
0061726834|5.0|Lauren Oliver's unique plot, capturing storytelling and amazing characters has taken the dystopian genre to a whole other level... the thought of the government claiming that having any type of feelings of love - which causes hate, jealousy, depression and more - is the main cause of all of our problems (crimes, mental illnesses, suicides... just to name a few) seems so realistic. The first half of this book really made me question whether or not it was truly a possibility that 'amor deliria nervosa' may exist...<br /><br />Lena has had a hard life already and all she wants to do is follow the rules and get cured. Cured from a disease that she doesn't even have yet. But, falling in love, having all of those raging emotions, can be fatal. She knows it. She's seen it. And she wants to be 'cured' before it happens to her... before she is exposed to the deliria... before she meets Alex.<br /><br />Alex is everything that Lena has been taught to fear her whole entire life. A resistor. An invalid. But she feels some truth in the things that he says. And she compares these things to her childhood, to how her mother used to be... before she died, because of the disease.<br />Though confused, Lena decides to think outside the box and explore her feelings and new knowledge. As the story moves along, Lena grows and accepts that not all things are what they seem. And that maybe, just maybe, everything that she has been taught to do and say is wrong.<br /><br />Everything about Delirium completely captured me:<br />The concept and plot is so original, who would have ever thought that all things pertaining to love could be a disease! A disease that can be cured; where all you have to do is have an operation and you will never have any deep feelings for anything ever again. You will never feel love, anger, passion, sympathy, bitterness... nothing. How upsetting!<br />Isn't it better to have love than to have never loved at all??? Heartache and all.<br /><br />The characters are so engaging and memorable! Lena, at first, is just trying to get by and then realizes that there is more out there than she ever knew. As things moved along, she grew stronger and stronger and was determined to figure things out for herself. Alex was charming - he never pushed and was understanding, to a point. He had his flaws and wasn't perfect - that's what made him even more charming to me. Lena's best friend was so full of life - I loved how she balanced Lena out.<br /><br />This is my 2nd Lauren Oliver book (my first was The Spindlers, which I absolutely loved!) - I knew that her writing would sweep me away into Lena's world. And I know that I am probably one of the last to read the Delirium trilogy, but I would still recommend this and will definitely re-read in the near future!engaging and memorable!

B00991TCOG|5.0|This is a really good CD, with catchy melodies which are performed beautifully.<br /><br />Having this CD on my car stereo has made driving to and from  work bearable as it soothe me while dealing with the usual pillocks.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you enjoy modern, electronic music with a touch of amazingly played violin notes.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|What a strange and awesome game.<br />The graphics are interesting and the concept is refreshing.<br />If I see one more tower defense game - I may die.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Keeps you on track to read the plan that you choose. I highly recommend this for studying the bible. It is easy to use.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Six year old son loves this game.<br />Would definitely recommend, lots of levels, great concepts, and lots of re-playability.<br />Probably the best Angry Birds to date.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It is impossible to put this book down.  It gets better with every chapter.<br /><br />I cannot wait to start the next book.
B008B92U32|1.0|Annoying to work with, but a great concept.<br />Samsung Galaxy S3 is not a fan of this app.....it is more headache than it is worth.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good Finale, but I felt that Book 1 was the best of the trilogy. Book 3 seemed to have strayed from the style of Book 1, however, I enjoyed all 3.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am loving the book so far wag easier to buy through amazon then a normal store. Maybe next time come out with a book that is less pixilated but still good thanks
B0063IH60K|4.0|I ENJOY PLAYING. NOT TOO COMPLEX. I CAN ACTUALLY WIN A GAME ON OCCASION WHEN I CAN CONCENTRATE<br />ON THE GAME
B000QCS8TW|5.0|loved this book, also watch the HBO series.  can't wait till it's back on in March.  also can't wait to start the next in the series.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|HOOKING UP THE KINDEL TO A POWER SOURCE IS NOT DIFFICULT, HOWEVER KNOWING WHEN TO REMOVE THE POWER SOURCE IS A QUESTION. I AM NOT A WHIZ AT TODAYS TECHNOLOGY BUT AS WITH MY COMPUTER I WILL LEARN.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I heard their version of &#34;Carol of the Bells&#34; on youtube. I watched several dozen times for the next few days. I heard some of the other songs from the album as well. They were quite good too. I probably would have just bought the one song, But their price for the album was so reasonable, I felt compelled to purchase the album, just to be extra supportive. Since they were extra economical.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|It contains 4 CD-s and several bonus such as some game codes to two valve games, as well as a mini comic. Unfortunately there isn't a list of what songs titles are or what is on which disk you need to go onto amazon to figure out what track number is what.  volume varies significantly track to track partly due to the sounds of the various electronic characters making up this games world.
B004X60QE2|5.0|Reminds me of Northern Exposure with a fun science twist. So well done. Quirky, funny, great characters. Try it; you will love it.
1616550414|4.0|It explains the Zelda universe and how the games all fit together as well as has some concept art. A lot of the pages are devoted to the most recent game Skyward sword which overshadows much of the book. It has a nice organization and lovely colored pages I was disappointed that it didn't have more on older games.
B002PEP4C8|2.0|Although this must have been an horrific<br />Experience, I felt that the theme was repetitive. I didn't need<br />The blow by blow told over and over.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This novel was painful to even finish. I thought it was incredibly predictable and the character development was HORRIBLE. You have no empathy for either of the main characters, in fact they are downright unlikable. I just was not impressed with this book at all and would not reccomend it.
B009VYAVTG|5.0|I love the Merlin series but was disappointed it took so long to get it in the US. Very good series and wish it didn't have to end.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I could not put this book down. What a journey this young<br />woman takes alone with pit falls along the way. A very<br />courageous person fulfilling a dream.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This season was phenominal and cannot wait to see season 2 episodes. I could not stop watching and the anticipation was killing me at the end of each episode.
B008220AVW|5.0|Katy Perry really did very well with this dvd movie. It makes you even more interested in her and her music. She touches her personal note in this movie and shows her great talent. Fantastic!!!
B0049IWQJW|5.0|This movie is a classic, with a solid story line and characters. When we do let the kids watch TV, it's usually movies that we've pre-screened, so I was happy to find this one just as entertaining the second time around.
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I`ve come to the conclusion after being into robben for 25 years,that I love his guitar playing,but his vocals don`t do it for me at all now.He needs someone else to sing.I love when he plays with his brothers.If you like his voice give it 4 stars,if not 2.Robben get a vocalest or cut an instrumental album.
