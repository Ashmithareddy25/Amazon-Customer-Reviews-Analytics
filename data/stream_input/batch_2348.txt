B001TM14VC|5.0|I have seen this movie dozens of times.  It was fabulous in HD.  It is one of those movies that you never get tired of watching.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a brutal show, but I actually like it better than Game of Thrones. Really well done. Watch at least 2 episodes and you will be hooked.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|My long-time dream came through with this compilation!<br />The sound quality is excellent of the remastered CDs!<br />The packaging is good - in my private opinion.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This movie is so funny and true to married couples for the most part. Judd apatow is amazing! I watched it 3 times in the 48 hours I had it...
0062082353|5.0|Very fast service and although I haven't finished reading it, it keeps your attention. I can picture what the authur is saying because his description of the events is so vivid.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great story line...great cast....great scenery....great music...in other words, GREAT.The quality of the HD also makes it a must see.  Keep up the good work.
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  Parts of it were pretty funny, but there were scenes that were just too crude for my taste, and not funny at all.  I loved Bridesmaids, so I can appreciate some off-color humor.  This was tasteless in my opinion, so I was disappointed.
B00BF11STU|4.0|good movie ... I believe the level of 'torture' shown in the move is realistic given the time when the events happened.  the quality on my XBOX was great.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|It's an amazing trilogy.  Just when you think nothing can go wrong anymore - it does.  I truly hope that book 4 will follow soon as book 3 ended with the possibility.<br />Wish I can be undetected hacker and become filthy rich from the vagrants in the financial world.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|well this game has glitches: but overall this is a pretty good game! this game is pretty fun but the game money is a lot!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I liked the novel and thought it was brilliant that the author, Emma Donoghue, wrote it from the boy's perspective.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This third book in the trilogy was phenomenal. I loved all the installments and will continue to read them again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's truly amazing. Anyone can play it. From 1-100.I think you'll enjoy this extremely entertaining and enjoyable experience while playing this game.overall you will love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book in the trilogy was awesome. The best part was that with my Amazon prime account I was able to borrow it free.
B0041VXGRS|4.0|Great recipe cake book to have on hand, this is something that should really appeal to kids of all ages!  A nicely different way to eat your cake and they also can look so enticing indeed.  It gives you an almost endless way to try and make as many varied pops as you can think up!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great hidden object and interaction game, I like underwater scenes. I have not finished it but I really enjoy what I have played so far. yes diffently buy the game!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This is a high quality repeater cable that is long, very durable and found no problems with computer data getting to my older printers. This will be an excellent purchase.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved &#34;The Book Thief&#34; by Markus Zusak.  The story is tastefully told through the angel of death and even<br />though it sounds spooky and alarming thinking of a death angel, it is so tastefully narrated that I thought it was<br />a &#34;kind and fascinating&#34; story.  I hIghly recommend this book!
B0058VW36U|4.0|my  5  years  old  daughter  likes  this  game : ) :) : ) . . . . . . .
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Loved it..should see really for yourself...Action, drama, truth & a whole lot more..every character played their role..amazing family values incorporated with the corruption
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|i don't think i need to say very much more than: brilliant...jane is one of the best observers of social interaction and is well able to put it all down in words...
B0050DIWFC|3.0|What would you do if your child had a genetic disposition allowing him to violently disturb society??  This is a questions all parents ask each other. However, it was hard for me to keep my interest in this book. Events are few and far between with the interesting parts of the story starting about 10 pages from the end.  The ending would be a great way to start another novel.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|i have already said what i think about jane austin's writing...there really is nothing else i can add...great writer...happy days
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game because it has many goals to achieve and coins to collect. I love the variaty of hover boards and characters. This game appeals to all ages. It's easy to become better the more you play. I like the way you can connect to facebook because you can get in a virtual competion with your friends. I recently reached a new high score and I'm in second place on my list of friends. This game is exciting and full of action with speeding trains and chasing security gards. I love the new update with the keys that allow you to continue after you die if you wish to. All in all, this game is a fun game that can be enjoyed by adults, teenagers, and children alike.<br />Although this a enjoyable game, I feel that it's not quite fun and original enough to be a five star game.
B0043UB0EI|4.0|I only watched the first two episodes to get a feel for if I would like to buy the series eventually.  This season featured the late Andy Whitfield who gave an excellent performance.  The stories and the acting was top notch.  I enjoyed what I saw but felt that the violence was too much for me.  For anyone that doesn't mind that this season of Spartacus is well worth having and viewing.  The story is very good and really holds your attention.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Each cut on the album presents an audio/visual experience thanks to the masterful use of language by this great storyteller.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing how Collins keeps up the intensity of the Hunger Games right through this entire book.  I also loved the character development of Katniss, Peeta, Haymish and Gale whom you understand so much better by the end of this one.  Great read.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Once past the numerous trailers, the documentary was mesmerizing, inspiring and touching all at the same time. I loved it.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|What can I say? Corey Taylor is a genius!! Lyrically this guy is miles above anyone else in the business!! This is a must buy if your a fan because it's even better than part 1. Part 1 was incredible but left me wanting more. The songs were way too short in my opinion. Part 2 is amazing and left me completely satisfied. Stone Sour gets better with every CD they put out.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; offered an interesting perspective into this man's Near Death Experience. However, Dr. Alexander's lack of faith before his NDE was evident even after and this book is proof of nothing more than a &#34;New Age&#34;, feel good pseudo-religion. Dr. Alexander's vast scientific knowledge and undeniable intelligence is evident in this book, but for those who choose to read this book in order to gain some kind of spiritual insight into heaven and our God will be disappointed.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Great season! Really enjoy the storylines. Will be watching the remaining seasons as well. Hope a new series comes out soon.
B00AVY5RSK|5.0|A classic that deserves to be read.  The English prose is as it was in that time and sometimes has to be absorbed as you go along.  Seeing the vaarious movie adaptions is not the real story.  So glad I revisited a book from my younger days.  You should visit too.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|This book was an unexpected gift in itself as it unfolded. A very unusual and moving book that also opened my eyes to new sides of my own children.
B008476HBM|5.0|A study of the lifestyle of the mid nineteenth century.  The mores and standards the must be met for the sake of propriety.  In this time Elizabeth looks for independence, love and happiness.  She must maintain strength to uphold her family with their pride and prejudices while being in misery from a love that seemingly eludes her.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Quick reference to words to confirm spelling as well as see definition, synonyms and occasionally words that mean the opposite.  Recommend.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I had heard from several people that this was a good movie, so I decided to watch it with my wife. We were both very impressed at how fun the movie was, and how clever the premise was. I especially appreciated the nod to the video games of my childhood.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Easy to use and has as much information about virtually every subject. The Home Page is slightly different but does not present any issues in accessing a topic.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|A book I think of as I read each that follows.  Surely the challenge for countries is to move forward to inclusiveness.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is very awesome you get money and prizes from daily challenges you can get a mystery box its cool u should get it :)@$$$&$
184448551X|5.0|I know a lot about embroidery -- but had never heard of blackwork.  This book is not the most idea to begin to learn -- but it showed me where I can ultimately go.  It's incredible how one can create pictures -- with shading and great artistry!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I loaded this app on my LG Lucid and my Kindle Fire.  Mainly due to the frustration of the generic mail app not fully functional for Yahoo.  Could not delete email on the generic app and it was really frustrating so I loaded Yahoo.  Works great on both of my devices!
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|I thought getting the game for free would be pretty cool, instead it's just an ad-supported free version like you always find on the Play Store.<br /><br />The full-screen video ads show up when you 'reset' the levels. I had to remove the app because of this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end.  It would be a great book for older teens, just showing them that high school is not their only world.  I enjoyed the characters in the book and the message.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|Liked this movie so much, after I bought a used dvd copy, I bought the blu ray version. The first time I watched this movie, I immediately watched it again. Wasn't what to make of it, but still found it funny and entertaining. The only movie I've ever owned and watched multiple times.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book gave me an insight into people with mental issues and how the families have to cope.  Such a good story and very well written.
B003GK21U8|4.0|'The Eye of the Needle'<br />I found the ' Eye of the Needle' a good and interesting book. It was well told and quite fasinating. A good holiday read. For a first book it showed real promise for the writer.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Even though this is a love story, it is full of suspense and gripping drama.  I much preferred the book over the movie, even though all of the brutality in the character's marriage would have been hard to watch.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|A very good read, especially if you are trying to learn what it takes to write a good book. Riordan's book is simple and yet complex. Good character development and a very human/relatable character.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|For the people who like reading legal books, this one is great and has a surprise twist.  I had trouble putting this one down.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book! I've been hooked since page one book one :) I never want the series to end
B00992CF6W|5.0|MUST BUY THIS GAME! I am so happy that it is only $7! I can't wait till the 7.7<br />(or the next update) comes out! I posted this because I LOVE THIS GAME AND THEY HAVE TO PUT IT AT $7 that is way too cheap of a price for a videogame this awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much detail than the movie! A lot of action which I love! I am very eager to read the next book!
B000NMZFKK|4.0|This was a great movie. Though it's more than two hours, it didn't really feel like it. I did know it was from a book without looking, just because how the story's told and everything. Brad Pitt is a tragic hero in this film, and he's a good one. Definitely worth watching at least once. I recommend for anyone who's old enough to appreciate the adult content and who enjoys a good story, with its ups and downs. This one's going on my shelf. (And it's not rated R for nothing - I would suggest you watch this movie first, before allowing children to watch it. If I had children, I wouldn't let them watch it. And so I don't suggest you watch it with the family if you haven't already seen it.)
B002J301NM|5.0|Funny movie. Love how it portraits cultural differences. I've watched it 4 times and each time I find something new & funny.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|These books are always a can't-put-it-down experience for me. I have read almost the entire series, and, yes, some are better than others, but none are not a great read.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is awesome and it tests your reflexes which is what I need to touch up on my martial arts
B0026PA05M|5.0|what a huge talent. LOVE LOVE this band !! Hope to see them play live. What a excellent group of musicians..LOVE IT!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season ONE is a &#34;masterpiece&#34; of story telling and movie craft.  However, apparently the producers of the Blu-ray were unsure of its potential and decided to deliver the first season on only two discs.  That seems to have required a compression regimen that results in a frame rate that reminds one of the &#34;shell shock&#34; stuttering of some car crashes or head injuries.  Season TWO however arrives on three discs with a picture quality up to par with the marvelous story telling and acting unblemished by the video artifacts of the first season discs.  The story is absorbing and most entertaining and I appreciate that even the most &#34;sensitive&#34; of incidents of the human condition are addressed without sensational exploitation, but with focus on the reality and challenge of life and the role of character in living it.
B000W07EKW|5.0|I already have the movies, but wanted the widescreen editions and why not with a little bonus passport and case shaped like a Swiss Bank Deposit Box. Not that expensive either. I haven't opened mine yet, debating if I should keep it as a collector or a fan...either way, you are sure to be happy with your purchase. Plus all three movie are awesome!
B000002OOY|5.0|I bought this soundtrack on cassette in the summer of 1993 after watching the movie, and I loved the music as much as the film itself.  Twenty years later it still remains one of my favorite musical scores, especially the main title, \\"Theme From Jurassic Park.\\"  It's moving, touching, and above all, magical and almost inspirational.  Seeing the dinosaurs for the first time while this music plays in the background is a larger-than-life moment.  You get the sense you are experiencing something you will never forget.  And after 20 years of enjoying this amazing movie and listening to this beautiful score, I know I never will.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|This is another sleep aid I have enjoyed using.  I am a firm believer in trying all natural things before using medication.  I would buy this CD again.
B00BEOYPKW|4.0|The newest album from Philadelphia's Kurt Vile is a long one, 11 tracks clocking in at nearly 70 minutes. Since the average song lasts over six minutes, the artist allows himself to stretch out, giving the swirling, spacey sounds on this record a very relaxed vibe.<br /><br />But don't make the mistake of applying psychedelic or stoner rock labels. The warm melodies and sonic textures constantly change as the dynamics swell and ebb with a perfectly organic feel. It's the most assured, most sophisticated, and strongest work of Vile's relatively young career. (He released his first solo album, \\"Constant Hitmaker,\\" in 2008, and achieved a breakthrough of sorts with \\"Smoke Ring For My Halo\\" in 2011.)<br /><br />The opening single, \\"Wakin on a Pretty Day,\\" is a happy song of almost ten minutes that draws you in and then rewards you with a gorgeous guitar solo in the second half. The next number, \\"KV Crimes,\\" is one of the few harder-edged, rocking tunes in the mix, like the later \\"Shame Chamber,\\" which augments its propulsive drumming and grungy guitar with ecstatic whoops. I like both of them a lot.<br /><br />The vocals on this recording are much as its title would lead you to imagine: most of them hazy and vague and mumbly, with wistful lyrics delivered at a languid walking pace. \\"Was All Talk,\\" the third track, picks up the tempo, however. It has a hypnotic effect, with beautifully subdued finger picking on the guitar and broad chords on the organ that rush in like ocean waves. The epitome of this sound may be the fourth song, the slow-building \\"Girl Called Alex.\\"<br /><br />Vile has released a hilariously informal video of the brief fifth tune, \\"Never Run Away,\\" featuring his delightful baby daughter. It's followed by two more winners, \\"Pure Pain\\" and \\"Too Hard,\\" both of which concern the loneliness and excesses of life on the road and the desire of a young father to protect his children. The former is a complex, layered song, while the latter is almost a folk tune that impresses me with the sensitive touch that Vile brings to his guitar arrangements.<br /><br />Two songs that appear late on the album, \\"Snowflakes Are Dancing\\" and \\"Air Bud,\\" are fine ones, although they suffer a bit from excessive similarity to other music in the set. Yet there are many details, from the synthesizer programming to the background vocals, that hold my interest. Vile's backing band, The Violators, is never less than superb.<br /><br />The closing track, \\"Goldtone,\\" is marvelous summary of all that's best about \\"Wakin on a Pretty Daze.\\" Like the opening tune, it's about ten minutes long, and it varies in mood and tone as it wends its idiosyncratic way to a lovely climax that is full of whooshing chords, shimmering vocals, and intricate guitar work. If you're not yet hip to Kurt Vile, you need to hear this album.that impresses me with the sensitive touch that Vile brings to his guitar arrangements.<br /><br />Two songs that appear late on the album, \\"Snowflakes Are Dancing\\" and \\"Air Bud,\\" are fine ones, although they suffer a bit from excessive similarity to other music in the set.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Didn't make it past the first 10 minutes of the movie before turning it off.  Don't waste your money on this one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app that I have ever spent 6.99 on! Works amazing and graphics are amazing!!!!! But it does need an update for being able to open chests,furnaces and crafting tables in Creative. Also Lava buckets and Water buckets!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game.  It is fun to play, the graphics are great, and I find it goes along quite well.
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to a lot of AM radio stations for sporting events.  Traveling hasn't allowed me to be able to receive the stations I rely on.  I ordered this app andsuddenly it was so easy for me to hear my favorite stations on my iPhone.  This is a terrific product with tons of stations to listen to and the quality of sound is remarkable.  I would recommend this to anyone struggling with reception on their radios. GREAT PRODUCT
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I've tried to play this, but perhaps I don't understand it.  I can't seem to get it to work for me.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I bought this book because I enjoyed Gone Girl by the same author.  Sharp Objects was well-written and involving, but the subject matter was unpleasant and the description of the pigs in the factory farm gave me nightmares!  I deleted it from my Kindle...
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I don't recognize this game.  I don't recall seeing it, nor getting it.  Again a bit more investigation will be needed before I can actually rate it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie, good plot. Enjoyed every minute. Would watch it again and again. Hope to see a sequel or 2 for this character.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|I can't get enough of this band. Their first two albums, \\"North Hills\\" and \\"Nothing is Wrong\\" were both some of the best CDs I've heard in recent years. I found out earlier this year that they would be releasing a new album and I've had a countdown ever since. It was worth the wait. I'd put this ahead of their debut album and maybe just a hair behind \\"Nothing is Wrong\\". It's much more along the lines of their second album.<br /><br />Here's a track by track review.<br /><br />1. Just Beneath the Surface - 7/10 A great intro track. Fitting lyrics and title, because you realize after listening you're going to be getting in deeper.<br /><br />2. From a Window Seat - 7/10 The first single off the album. This grew on me after a few listens. You find it gets stuck in your head very easily. Very lively and fun.<br /><br />3. Just my Luck - 7/10 This is one of the weaker songs on the album to me. Very slow, but very moving. I can see how this would appeal to fans that favored the first album.<br /><br />4. Someone Will - 8/10 This song has some cliche lines, but it's heartfelt. Lively, and some very fun basslines/harmonization. I enjoy this one a lot.<br /><br />5. Most People - 10/10. My favorite song on the album, by far. The instruments are great, the vocals are great, and it's a fun song to listen to loud. I would have picked this as the first single.<br /><br />6. Something in Common - 7/10 I'd put this along the same lines as Just my Luck. A good song, but a little slow when with the rest of the album. Great nonetheless.<br /><br />7. Hey Lover - 8/10 This is a cover of another band, but it's great. Could have easily been written by Goldsmith. I like the back and forth vocals on it between the siblings. Piano is really nice here.<br /><br />8. Bear Witness - 9/10 Another favorite. This song builds very well. A catchy chorus, and some really fun imagery within this song. Took me a couple listens to appreciate this, but it's very good.<br /><br />9. Stories Don't End -8/10 I find the songs that the album is named after aren't very good. This was an exception. A very wholesome song, albeit along the slow lines of some of the other tracks. It's a great medium between Bear Witness and From the Right Angle.<br /><br />10. From the Right Angle - 10/10 My second favorite on the album. It starts strong and never lets go. Has great lyrics, fun rhythm, and is just a blast to listen to.<br /><br />11. Side Effects- 8.5/10 For some reason I could tell the album was coming to an end by listening to this. It has a very good effect as one of the last songs. This song took some time to grow on me but I enjoy it quite a bit now that I've listened to it a few times.<br /><br />12. Just Beneath the Surface (Reprise)- 7/10. A stripped down version of the first song on the album. Not much different to me.<br /><br />Standouts: From a Window Seat, Most People, Bear Witness, From the Right Angle<br /><br />Go buy this album!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I wanted an app that simply downloaded videos from youtube. This app did just that. No fuss no mess. Very easy to use and the great thing is, when I download a video on to my Samsung Galaxy S3 it goes right into my video player and gallery. How sweet! Thanks for making this app awesome and available!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've been told by most of my family and friends that I would enjoy this show, but I was hesitant because i heard the first season wasn't as great as some if the later seasons. While there are moments that are tacky and lines that feel forced, I really love the idea of everything that happens in this season. I loved Christopher eccelston as the doctor, so I'm sad to see him go. Definitely a must watch!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is a view of a moment in time. Well acted and written. I was very pleased to see Lincoln the man alongside the legend.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A free game that doesn't force you to buy stuff! Simply put... this game is fun!<br /><br />You start with a small shark and once you eat enough and gain enough levels (which is fast) you can upgrade to the next level. Once you eat enough and gain enough coins, you get the next level. SO far, I have had to buy nothing to progress.<br /><br />You can customize your shark and make him more powerful plus add little things to make him look different.<br /><br />Great game!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|NICHOLAS SPARKS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS AND THIS BOOK IS UP TO HIS USUAL TALENT.  HAD SEEN THE MOVIE AND AS ALWAYS THE BOOK IS MUCH BETTER - PERFECTION CANNOT BE IMPROVED ON.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|The historical aspect of the series adds such depth to the character's stories that it makes it incredibly fun and interesting to watch.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it. Couldn't put it down until I got to the last page.  On to her next...
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Well i should start by saying this is no remake of the classic The Wizard of Oz. But do NOT let that stop you from watching this movie. I will give a RARE spoiler and say that Mila Kunis is not the best at playing a villain; however Oz The Great And Powerful is still a really good movie. To describe it: It like Star Wars minus the lightsabers or relatively similar to The Chronicles Of Narnia in a sense. I was Pleasantly surprised that I Liked James Franco's  character in this movie. The plot has few weak moments but not enough to make it a bad movie. The good thing about Oz the Great and Powerful is that it knows exactly what it is, and what it is doing as a movie. So Overall, good supporting cast (Finley,the flying monkey is really cool) and an above average (just Good enough to keep your interest the whole movie) story line. I will say I Liked this film enough to buy it on Blu Ray.<br /><br />3.5 stars
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|The writer shows the zealotry, arrogance and stated intellectual superiority of his position as an atheist.  His feeling is that only stupid people accept a creator.  Most people who walked in a room with the TV on, didn't like the channel and would change channels.  Dawkins would want the station take off the air.
B00AL3OD7C|5.0|I loved this album growing up and it is still awesome. I used to have both the cassette and the album but the both disappeared a long time ago.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|totally a blast! wouldn't recommend this for to young an audience but definitely a fun movie for teens or adults. certainly better that many 'live-action' comic book movies
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I was totally captivated by this young star's mature voice and warm song delivery!  He takes you from the edge of falling in love to the brink of despair and to your mom's cooking with a little salvation thrown in for good measure!  I can scarcely think of a subject that he missed or a mood he didn't capture!  All of these things done with an honest view and sincere voice.  You can't find better country than this great album!  It also makes a great gift for the country music lover on your list!
030746363X|4.0|I have been training for 20+ years and have an extensive library of training literature and I love the personal style rather than scientific language heavy stuff which is why i probably loved this so much.<br /><br />In a nutshell this book cuts through all the \\"chaff\\" and just follows the keep it simple stupid (KISS) formula the Author is renowned for (to an extent). To be honest the blood sugar monitoring/bodyfat % stuff is probably more than your average Joe either wants or needs? Just use the mirror (not the scales).<br /><br />Cut through all the bull, don't over complicate things and you'll get results from this book, maybe you won't get Tim's results, despite his claims of being a \\"hardgainer\\" I think maybe he has a little more potential than he shares with the reader but as i've said i love the personal experimentation approach, it may not stand up in a peer review journal way but overall an excellent book in my opinion.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of the best books ever written. Witty, entertaining, sweet love story and a great peek into social customs of the 1800's.  My 12 year old daughter just read it and loves it as much as I do.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you are looking for a touching, heart-wrenching story about a four-legged friend, look no further.  Beautiful story and imagery.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I love puzzles and games that challenge quick thinking. This game lacked all challenge and was simply boring. If you want something as simple and mindless as popping bubble wrap, then this is your game.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Well worth it. A great TV show that you just don't see anymore. A scifi show that tackles real world problems in an entertaining way while presenting an ideal humanity. The HD restoration is beautiful and not jarring unless you had previously watched the series on DVD for comparison. Highly looking forward to the rest of the series and hoping for a DS9 HD-ification, fingers crossed.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Great for around the house cleaning or in the evening, or just trying to unwind. Here's my five more words...
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|It is story you will read and not put down. The characterization of Aubrey and Maturin are so well written you will obsess over them if you have to put this book down. A good dictionary is recommended for the nautical terms, and look, your learning now too!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I got bored of it pretty quick... Here are the thirteen more words required to finish the stupid, stinking rating.
B008M87GJK|4.0|BBC often has the latest breaking news hours and sometimes days before the US media does. They pay little or no attention to political correctness.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kid showed me this game and I got highly addicted to it during our trips around the country, YA!
B005LAIIGC|4.0|A great feature film not only animation wise but story wise. It talks on friendship, hope and the innocence of children that seems be somewhat lacking in our technology and gadget driven world. A great film to watch with the family!
B00973CGXK|3.0|It's all right, not really something you can listen to with other people. It kind of reminds me of when Smashing Pumpkins came out with Siamese Twins, which was awesome, then Melancholy and Infinite Sadness, which was a little strange, but awesome in its own right (but you couldn't really listen to it with people), and then just got weirder and crapier with Zwan, then I stopped listening... I love the killers, but you're starting down a slippery slope... Billy Corgan still hasn't recovered, last I saw an interview where he was trying to bring back alternative music or something.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I have always liked matching games but have not found one with diffrent levels and boards for each game. The adventure part is fun because you do not need friends to continue one. I find this game highly addictive.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Fun for the whole family. I wish it wasn't  so heavy on needing friends cause none of my friends play.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|From the writing to the acting to the sets, this is one of the best drama series I have ever watched.  The character development and interaction, and the story line are superb.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I enjoyed it from beginning to end! I was disappointed when it was over! I look forward to the next movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 isn't as good as season 1-2, but it still satisfies my zombie cravings!  It keeps getting crazier and crazier but is addicting because everyone really really wants to see how it ends.  Acting is generally good, but it relies on the story line and zombie effects to be good.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I've read several of the books written about this operation, including &#34;No Easy Day&#34; and &#34;SEAL Target Geronimo&#34;, that all pretty well line up with each other. I understand artistic interpretation and latitude, but this was obviously political. Too much time was spent on &#34;enhanced interrogation&#34; with too many other important details left out. This film obviously had &#34;help&#34; from the current administration. I'm glad I watched it, but I won't watch it again nor recommend it.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Am only sorry to have recently learned of him . This performance at the Vienna Opera House had us riveted - his muiscal talent - and that of his group - truly know their craft!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! The calculator is the size of the screen making it very easy for this wearer of glasses. I also love that you see the number that you typed in along with the answer. It's easy to catch mistakes.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Excellent! Very well done - he should have been awarded Best Actor for his part in this. Really enjoyed it
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wake up all men and read this! We are being poisoned. I am not some kook. My doctor recommended this book two Christmas's ago and ever since I have been very careful with my wheat intake and my health has improved. This doctor is onto something.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Steve Jobs was very honest in this book. He led a fascinating life, which can be summed up in one word &#34;Apple&#34;.  I can remember when the first Apple IIe came out and have been a fan of Apple since.  The company has a fascinating history, which is what Steve Jobs's life was.
B00338QENI|2.0|Too much technical jargon.  Too much emphasis on family tree.  Not an interesting read.  It's like the author tried to make a short subject into a long book.  I got through it but it was difficult.  Interesting story.
B000W93CHC|3.0|It is very predictable.  I read &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and this book is almost a carbon copy.  Not a lot of originality but none the less Ken Follett does a good job.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The advertising is incredibly intrusive. It seems to get stuck right after the advertising on a reqular basis. It's a shame, have enjoyed angry birds on the net and on an Ipod Touch. It just seems to be an issue with this implementation,

B007HC3LHS|5.0|Took me a couple of pages to get down how the story was going but once into it, i could not put this book down.  it was scary at times but you had to get to the end to see how it all played out.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves suspense!
B0060CRM6M|5.0|Love it... it shows little kids that even when your small you can be big. My daughter love the music but disk was in bad shape so I desided to go instant.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Awesome movie. One of the 80s best movies. You've got it all, action, love, and russian war crisis wrapped into one. That's all that needs to be said.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|Love this series..  Great mixture of intrigue, study of human psyche and behavior.  Love this series and am re-reading them!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I saw this singing group on a talk show and was very impressed with them.  I like the bluesy songs on the album very much
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Where to begin with this...... I put off reading this book for months after seeing this listed on so many \\"top favorites lists\\". It doesn't rank up there on mine although the writing was good and the story flowed well. Talk about dysfunctional relationships. Abby is just stupid and Travis is a loose cannon. Both are hot heads that came from dysfunctional families so for them to be drawn to each other is a stretch. Both are too young and I doubt they would make it in the long term but at least they are both in college. They do grow up some and evolve over time. I understand the next book is from Travis's point of view which had that been included in this book would have made this less of a train wreck that you couldn't stop watching. Its an intense story that keeps your interest and I read it in less than a day. Its on the expensive side that I don't usually buy and decided to since nothing else peaked my interest at the time. I will probably read the next one but will wait on the reviews
0061124958|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I am a second grade teacher and my students LOVED the story. There were several sad faces and teary eyes at the end.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Wish they had continued this series on SyFy.  Cool technology on the Atlantis base and the Wraith were a challenging enemy.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|One that should be added to any collection. A good mix of rock and pop with 70s and 80s influence.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Makes one appreciate every day! More than a love story, it is a story of courage that one can only hope they would handle the same way.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This should be required viewing for all high school students. It shows the greatness of the man as well as the work that had to go on behind the scenes to permanently free the slaves. A great untold story told as only Steven Spielberg can tell it.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Beautifully photographed, beautiful story. I didn't think they would be able to relay such a powerful book into a movie, but they succeeded.
B0098460O4|5.0|These two are the very BEST Simon has ever found on any show or venue ever! Charlotte sings like an angel, and Jonathan could be the next Pavarotti. This from a fan who does not like female voices generally, and who thought Pavarotti was the greatest opera voice ever.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting is outdone only by the writing. The scenery only by the wardrobes. The characters only by each other.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Another album I have loved across the years, and was thrilled to add it to my cloud at such a good price.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Not as good as Season 1 or 2, but still great. I can't wait for Season 4 to start, love Maggie Smith.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This was an excellent movie as well as educational. Daniel Day Lewis out did himself. He was perfect and true to his character.
B001AW156U|3.0|It snapped on really well and was fun to play with while it lasted, but it didn't last very long and broke.
B00110K62U|5.0|More than met my expectations. The cast is great and the music wonderful.  It never gets old to hear such great artists.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is a really fun, enjoyable film.  It's not easy to make a musical film that will appeal to young people, but they pulled it off.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I had heard this was good, so I downloaded it for a four year old (who has a good attention span and DOES watch movies) but he didn't show any interest in it and didn't even finish it.  So, I don't know.  Guess I wasted my money.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Most emotional season! If you like Dr who this is a must watch! After catching up I plan to research!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A large and very visible display, the calculator delivers as promised with a good key layout.  Good for figuring basic values and some scientific calculations.  No real drawbacks I can see, it's a good app to have.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|A little slow at first - and I'm someone who hates slow movies - and I almost bailed, but I am SO glad I stuck with it. Amazing story I'll never forget, about an inspiring person, I'm glad I had a chance to &#34;meet&#34; in this film.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|The blu-ray trumps the DVD by leaps and bounds. The movie is magnificent quality and that feeling when Hannibal is exposed for the cannibal she is at the beginning of the movie is ne'er better!
B006RXQ8RI|1.0|Good, pointless fight scenes - who cares? What? 13 more words required? F- you! Six more words, three, two, one.
B007G8MMP0|5.0|Great movie made even better by blu-ray. Mel Gibson's performance is crisp and fantastic and if his anger at his enemies was any more real than I would have needed a poncho for protection from his spit.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is hands down one of the greatest shows I've seen in a long time.  The kind of show you want to stay up all night watching, wonderful characters, will not disappoint.
B0090SI460|5.0|While I had high expectations for this 3D experience they may have been to high. The movie is beautiful and the 3D is great but there is more potential behind this 3D movie than is tapped.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a good story line from how Captain America came to being in fighting the enemy during WWII to the present day. I can't wait for the next Captain America movie to come out to see how he adjusts to the modern day.
B0087BNJ0M|5.0|The steelbook is pretty sweet. The only disappointment is in the lack of bonus disks but the packaging is flawless.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down-what a great writer- not many good books out there but this one is worth a read you will enjoy
B004FEFZU2|5.0|I originally bought this movie in 2D blu-ray. While it was petty, knowing I could get 3D had me less than satisfied. Upon getting this 3D version I felt it is better at hime even than in the theaters! GREAT home theater addition.
B005PK553C|4.0|Great plot, albeit a little confusing at times, but the cast does a stellar job portraying their plight as a family thrown  together under difficult circumstances. The characters are believable and the series is well written with a time line that makes sense which is getting harder to find in &#34;for TV&#34; series these days.  .  Jessica Lang once again proves to be outstanding and preserves her place as one of Hollywood's truly great actresses.  We'll see if they can keep up the momentum in season two.
B00867GKIK|5.0|Great 3D movie! The kids love it and the visual presentation truly takes advantage of the 3D technology. Objects pop from screen to living room gorgeously. Brilliant.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Movie led me to read more about what actually happened.  A lot of political sheenanigans (what else is new?) took place to pass the 13th ammendment that I did not learn about in school.  Eye opening.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is our favorite show right now! My wife and I absolutely love it. That should be 13 more words.
B00BGTRTSA|5.0|Super high energy metal. Heavy influence of Dio, Van Halen, Led Zepplin. Tons of unabashed shred solos. Something that has been missing from american metal.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Every album is a must buy.  This doesn't disappoint.  It's nice to hear Jesse's vocals again too, although Howard is top-notch as well.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This book is from Bujold's Vorkasigan saga, which is a series I seriously adore. I was not disappointed. This book lives up to the rest of the series. It's got twists and turn and witty narrative. And Ivan. I've always liked Ivan. I hope he gets more books.
B008602KQI|5.0|I liked the story line and action. The part she played was amazing. The future may come to this type world
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I thought this app would be fun. but I was very dissapointed. you cant even move. don't get it. I hate it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book and was well worth the money I put into it. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good book.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|All around good album. I don't know if I like it more or less than Black Sands, but regardless this is worth purchasing.<br /><br />Really dig how Bonobo slightly changes styles between albums, but still keeps his own &#34;sound&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. I have read it several times and the kindle version make it more affordable and well worth your time.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Great song - hear it on the radio all the time, now have it on my MP3 player and can listen to it in the car

B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I have tried everything to install this but it just wont let me no matter what I do. I don't know if other people have this problem but it needs to be fixed.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|I was surprised by this movie when I caught the last half of it on TV. I rarely enjoy older court-room movies, but this one piqued my interest. WIth a great cast and story that is very relevant today, it was not a difficult choice to watch the whole thing from beginning to end. If you enjoy a witty, smart and engrossing film, this is one to watch and well worth a rental. Or two.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I honestly wanted to read this book for a long time, but I honestly never had the time. I had been led away by work and school, and the Dwarves series (an excellent book series by a devoted author). But when I had finished Larry Niven's Ringworld I needed to keep my sci-high level up and the flavor of the day was Enders Game. I had no idea that the author Card was a native North Carolinian, and that he lives an hour away from my humble Charlotte. The writing is very diplomatic it treads both reality and fiction seamlessly and the times when we are among Andrews thoughts they are vivid, with a touch of childish fantasy. I admit that a friend spoiled the end for me but the delivery still shocked me and while you pity the poor buggers you are given a sweet sense of satisfied hope that they will revive. I give it a 4.5/5.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|The item was not what I expected. I was looking for a decent headphone amplifier, and what I got was an awfully flimsy little plastic box. If you look into one of the jacks on this, you can actually see through to the other jack and out the other side. Quality of product = not good. This made no appreciable difference in the volume or sound quality of my music. Useless.
B00BESKTMG|4.0|Lucy Lu, Russell Crowe, RZA, Batista, Kung Fu movie with RAP from Wu Tan Crew founder.<br />Nuff said!<br />I like the Lucy Lu shuffle, A repeat from Kill Bill.  Oddly awesome.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|I love this movie, I saw it when it came out and still holds up today.  If you are into binary, psychadelics, math or sacred geometry this is the film for you.
B00004C8TF|3.0|Although Kubrick used this recording for his movie 2001, its impact world-wide came with the Berlin Philharmonic performance, marketed by DG, who made a mint from selling this incarnation to the world as the 2001 fanfare. But I wonder just how important it is to emphasise \\"the original\\"? Only for movie buffs, I dare say. And then for only about 2 minutes worth of fun, not for a \\"work\\"!<br />For the discriminating listener the fanfare is the highlight of the tone poem, the only other excitement coming with the bitonality of the closing pages. In between we have to endure lots of laboured pseudo-philosophical, uninspired plodding by the craftsman Strauss in a futile attempt at writing \\"intellectual\\" music. Until this recording appeared, most experts on Strauss' music agreed that it is the weakest of all his mature symphonic poems. Amazing what a difference 2 or so minutes can make to the perceptions of the public!<br />The other two works, however, Don Juan and Till Eulenspiegel (which none of the reviews on this page even bother to mention (!)), belong among his most successful compositions. Both of these performances are by a conductor still relatively young, and still a very \\"hungry\\" and ambitious podium lion. Karajan was still on the upward slopes of the conductor's Mt Everest when they were made. And so the Don's \\"superbia\\" is superbly managed, with just the right amount of passion and brio, tenderness and restlessness, and a wonderfully apt attention to the innumerable orchestral colours from Strauss' rich palette. Till is a little short of fun, but full of the gruff burlesque that seems more appropriate to Strauss' Bavarian sensibility - although the contemporary account of Kempe with the Berlin Philharmonic conveys all this much better with its uproarious fizz and breathtaking instrumental virtuosity.<br />Karajan recorded all three of these works again in Berlin, for DG. The sound is a great improvement on the Decca album, and the Zarathustra arguably comes off better in the comparison. However for Don Juan and Till, Karajan does not find the same urgency and ardour, or impetuosity, as in Vienna. There are episodes of flabbiness now which testify to his growing desire to paint the works in more beautiful colours, at the expense of forward drive. Once again Kempe, with the Staatskapelle Dresden, is there with accounts that do a little more than serving as rival recordings. Kempe conveys with total conviction the pacing that is somewhat slackened off in Karajan's readings, and the splendour of his orchestra seems at least to my ears pip the Berliners to the post on this occasion.<br />Just going back for a moment to the 1960 mark, a reminder for lovers of \\"classics\\" may not be amiss, therefore I mention that Fritz Reiner is also a strong contender in these stakes. His Zarathustra is surprisingly demure in the fanfare, compared to Karajan; but he conducts the rest of the work in eminently authentic style. His Don Juan from 1959 may well be the finest ever put on disk, not a note out of place and a glorious tapestry of sound. The Till, which he recorded in Vienna, is a disappointment. In this work, he is entirely humourless and must yield to both Kempe and Karajan.<br />Between these three conductors, much depends on what you expect to hear. If Zarathustra is your main bill of fare, then Karajan's Berlin recording with its more ample and analytical sounds and the absence of extraneous noises would seem to be preferable to the Decca/Vienna version. For Don Juan my vote goes to Reiner, though Kempe follows hard upon his heels. In Eulenspiegel, Kempe is on his own. Finally, if you wish to have all three in a \\"classic\\" recording, I feel that Kempe, consistently maintaining the highest standard and attunement, would have to be your man.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I loved the first season more, the second season is still 90% as strong & well worth your time in watching.  It seems to lead some where that you never get to, perhaps in the third season.
B0000041WV|2.0|This has been called a \\"classic\\", but so have many other recordings of questionable quality, just because they are old. In my vocabulary (confirmed by the Oxford Dictionary) \\"classic\\" means \\"memorable\\", a \\"very high level of excellence\\", that sort of thing. These recordings were praised highly at the time of their appearance because of Kertesz' breezy conducting. He was the new young eagle on a scene still dominated by sexagenarians and older. But today, 50 years later, there is no need for reverence. We've had many complete Dvorak sets since then, and many of them preferable on every count - performance, orchestral playing, recording quality etc.<br />Starting from top down: Kertesz account of the New World Symphony is brassy, aggressive and (as especially the Scherzo shows) quite unidiomatic. But what bothers me most is the repeated untidy ensemble. With one of the most recorded symphonies one has a right to expect that the orchestra - and this is the London Symphony in its best days! - knows the score in their sleep. So who is responsible for the slips and miscues? And why weren't they corrected? Next in line is No. 8, a considerable improvement especially considering the \\"wild\\" tempo fluctuations. But I am still unhappy with some episodes in the first and last movement where Kertesz is pushing the players to the last ounce, and the result is an intolerable (unmusical) uproar. No. 7 is probably the best of this trio; but when I think of the Karajan/Vienna reading made roughly at the same time, and also by Decca, the sound (especially the strings and horns) is so much better, cleaner and musical that this takes a decided second place.<br />No. 6 (formerly No. 1) suffers again from the conductor refusing to allow the composer his moments of Bohemian indulgence. Rather Kertesz mistakes it for brashness. By now impatience should be getting the better of you, so I'll simply end by noting that No. 3 with its Wagnerian overtones is also whipped along, even though here of all places Dvorak seems to ask for, indeed demand, a more leisurely basic pulse. The best of this lot is No. 5 (formerly No. 3), a harmless symphonic exercise full of good spirits, and for once Kertesz enters into the spirit without his usual hard driving.<br />The sound technology wasn't too good either. The listener will have to be prepared for instances of tape saturation and shrill violins and trumpets (often pushed too hard). Decca made many fine records in those days, some of them sounding as good as the best today (most notably the recordings supervised by Culshaw). I am mystified at the variability of sound in these recordings. They're not actually bad, but far from Decca's best.<br />A few years down the track Kubelik compiled another complete set for DGG, conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. This is one of the outstanding landmarks of the stereo era. Kubelik was a much better conductor than Kertesz, especially in the eastern European repertoire. I won't comment on more modern issues. None of them is \\"better\\" than Kubelik, who had a very strong grip on authenticity and was as Czech as Neumann, Pesek and others - but he had the Berliners to play for him. Some difference!<br />In a word: I don't think Kertesz is wholly competitive in this repertoire.<br />My preference is for Kubelik; but on the whole there are at least a half dozen complete recordngs available now that are a better (musical) investment than this so-called \\"classic\\".f all places Dvorak seems to ask for, indeed demand, a more leisurely basic pulse.

B005544V6A|5.0|Suits first season is outstanding.  The writing is witty & the story is strong.  Certainly one of the best new series on tv in recent years.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch's previous release, \\"Strange Cousins from the West\\", was personally disappointing. I'm glad to see they are back again with a rock-solid effort led by Machine. When I heard he was producing this album, I knew it was going to be on par with \\"Blast Tyrant\\". I was vindicated. This album hits all the right marks and is still innovative and fresh.<br /><br />This band is a revelation. I just wish more people could appreciate them for what they are.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Lots to learn .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . . .
B000FC13MM|5.0|I have read this book several times now- not only does it have a great story line, but it also has really beautiful writing. Although the book is about a topic that is seemingly extremely gory (bringing dead things to life/putting them back to rest), Garth Nix manages to somehow make it tasteful and detailed without being something you wouldn't want to read right before bed.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|As usual, this was a great episode of the Next Generation. It had the brutish Klingons being very rowdy and quarelling constantly<br />but when it came to Worf being cruel, he showed his human side. Captain Picard was very brave throughout as always.

B003SI5NX0|2.0|I know the movies a cute movie I rented it for my lil sister then was disappointed when it said unavailable when I went to play. We watched Netflix instead
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I'm a dedicated JRR Tolkien fan. I have read most of the books and have the movies too. The Hobbit movie was pretty close to the book. That's why it's going to be 3 movies from the last I heard. For a little book there was a lot of action in it. And it takes up a lot of film and time to tell a story the right way. The only real gripe I have with the movie is that several of the 'dwarves' don't look like dwarve's at all. And I see no reason why they should look like regular men. They are not regular men, they are dwarves and should have been made to look so. Thorin, Fili and Kili in particular needed a lot more makeup to convince me they were portraying dwarves. All the acting was great. Radagast was a trip. Really funny. This is a very good movie and I look forward to the rest of them coming out.

B00821OX98|5.0|love Wylie, a bit hard on the family ties, but good to see.  Love the show.  Needs watching!  Now wait for the 2nd season!
B009FZFONO|5.0|My absolute favorite tv show of all time! Really looking forward to the next season. Zombies Rule! Zombies Rule! Zombies Rule!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved it! I know lots dot but to each their own. It had enough angst, drama, love, passion and so worth I thought it was really good recommend
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is wonderfully acted, brilliantly casted and highly addictive. There's not one bad performance in the show. I love it!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|So many people going through this and unfotunately  so many in the future.<br /><br />Exceptional writing style, really drew you into their life but was surprised that the power of humor was not touched on as a tool in dealing with this awful disease.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty was a good movie to watch- very exciting and alots of action<br />A must see movie! I didnt expect to enjoy this type movie glad I watched it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved this book so much! Really changes your view of how your actions can change a person's perspective on life!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I like Russel Crowe, but he's not a singer.  He detracted from an otherwise good movie.<br />Too many big names instead of good voices.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game on my kindle I had to put it on my iPod. Now my husband is waiting for it to come out on the nook.
B001DJ7PMI|4.0|If you love anything to do with JFK and the conspiricies that followed his death, this movie will open your eyes to the many possibilies that &#34;could have been&#34;.  Love it!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Whilst hard reading, this book should be on the shelf of any true lover of the English literature. It should be prescribed for all English literary students. reading this book exposes one to the vastness of the English vocabulary.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|This cartoon is cute with some funny parts, but there are some parts which are boring for the kids. I like it, but I have some problem with it. (e.g.. the bees have 6 legs not 4!) It is not my favorite and I think my child has a same oppinion. It is just one of our good cartoons.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I am in love with this cd! I listen to when I wake up ever morning! I am so glad that I decided to buy this cd. Radioactive is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time!
B006P96PAO|5.0|This movie is a tear jerker. After watching it, I did some relection of my own life. I would recommend it to anyone!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Not only does this book provide wonderful insights into the many interrelated events happening in this period, but it also causes one to think about some dangerous parallels between the U.S. today and what was happening in Germany in the 1930's leading up to WW II.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love these kinds of books: fascinating historical events sprinkled with compelling characters. I find this one more interesting than the Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, perhaps because these historical events are closer and more remembered to me. I've already started the second installment and can't wait until the third comes out in print.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I didn't give it a 5 star rating because it deals with so many ADULT subjects.....but for the adult crowd it's a prett good show.
B002SM2QDC|4.0|not quite as good as  &#34;Marvel's the Avengers&#34; , but is still good . great CGI and plot fits . some hard transitions between SETS and CGI in some places . still , if you want SCIFI and military BAM BAM , this is your  flick .
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I was looking for a nice long book to read on vacation so I picked this book.  Story line is original and well written, but I think it could have been written with half as many characters and still been the same book.  All the family lineages run together and don't be surprised if you really don't keep them all straight until you get to the end.  It can get a little ponderous in spots but the plot moves along and the &#34;first person&#34; style of writing from multiple perspectives seems to work.<br /><br />I had the kindle edition, and was a little concerned about some previous issues with the kindle edition.  However, I found no problems and it was not a hinderance so I plan to but the additional series for kindle in the future.
B000ITF86E|5.0|GOTTA BE GOOD and it is . western humor with two of hollywoods most BEAUTIFUL and TALENTED ; Stephanie Powers and Maureen Ohara .  John drug his talented son Patrick in and he holds his own well . Jerry VanDyke always SLAPSTICK and great fill . CHING the cook is HYSTERICAL all thru and i hope found more work than just this film . almost forgot most LOVELY WOMAN ever in hollywood ; Yvonne DeCarlo and her acting skills masterful in humor and STUNNING .  if you dont enjoy this flick , yer dead ...  i give this &#34; TWO RIFLES UP!!&#34;  rating
B001NHNG64|4.0|Started with Reacher book 1 (slow and too much descriptive detail) went on to #2 and enjoyed it.  Lots of action and quick read.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This was a good movie. I didn't fully watch it from the beginning but what I did watch of it was pretty good. Its a little freaky but interesting.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|I love this movie!! I wante to watch movies I haven't seen in a while and this was one, I really forgot what it was all about I'm glad I watched it again :)
0446572985|5.0|It's David Baldacci, what more needs to be said?<br />Easy read, exciting, logical ... great characters.<br />Only thing wrong is that it isn't Camel Club
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc  ( criterion collection ) as follows-<br />movie - 5 / 5<br />video - 4 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />there should be no other purchase of this movie other than the criterion version<br />of this blu ray disc.<br />simply put - really good, with some shots a bit soft probably due to the source material being unable to be enhanced any further.<br />a must have for your collection, you should immediately dump any other blu ray<br />version or dvd of this great movie.<br />good buy...
0446573019|5.0|Is about how long it took to read: less than a day. Don't you just hate it when the best reads don't last a week?
B00AJER3SE|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 4.5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br /><br />great remaster of this classic sci fi movie.<br />super video and audio. finally time to dump the first blu release of this movie, which sucked.<br />highly recommended...
B00AH8U4OW|5.0|Something very differant to watch that is not like other shows.<br />Just make sure its you watching it and not your children
B005S9ELY4|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video- 4 /5<br />audio- 4.5 /5<br /><br />pretty good video and great audio.<br />found the movie to be better than expected, i liked it...<br />recommended for your collection
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is one of the best movies, beautiful pictures, impressive demonstrations of the relations among people, animals. It worth the time!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I read the books now I seen the action and have a face to the character when I read the book again. :)
B004X2M9VY|5.0|If you are new to Who, I think the seasons featuring Amy as the Doctor's companion are the best. My 14 yo daughter reeeeally wanted me to watch a few episodes with her, and I did. Mind you, I am not into sci-fi or anything having to do with lizard people. However, I watched about three episodes and I didn't understand what the heck was going on or how they tied into one another - but - I became hooked last fall! What did it for me was watching a few specific episodes and things began to make sense.<br /><br />My recommendations to all of you in a similar situation, watch these episodes: Season 5:1  Season 5:10  Season 6:8  Season 4:1 Season 3:2  Season 3:1  Season 3:3.  Once you have a good feel for everything, then you can start watching them in order. They make much more sense if you view them that way. Rose is a great companion because she eventually falls in love with the doctor.<br /><br />I feel the best episode was the Christmas Day 2012 release. But, you would need quite a few episodes under your belt before all of the hilarity would make sense.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Love the show and color. great way of showing all the kindness of God in verious figures that kids love today
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Seems to be one of those movies that she wants to watch over and over and over and over again.<br />I mean, I like it too, but after the second or third time, I'm kind of over it...  :)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a very fun game, can become addicting! :) recommend to all ages. Simple enough and good way to pass the time.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|We absolutely love this soundtrack!  We saw the movie, saw it a second time and knew that we had to have the soundtrack.  We actually got the DVD of the movie after getting the soundtrack and listening to it a few times.  The music is so upbeat and it makes you want to sing along.  Anyone who loves the music that has a good beat( my homage to Dick Clark here) and is fun to sing along with will love this soundtrack.  The movie is pretty good too!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis. That's all I have to say. He is the reason this movie came to life. He is the reason we have not had a successful portrayal of Lincoln until now. Because this was who was supposed to do it. You will not be disappointed.
B002N1AERI|5.0|Working on getting the whole discography. My girlfriend and I are huge Epica fans. She introduced them to me a few years ago and I fell instantly in love with the sound and message in their songs. We got to see them live in Houston 2012. They are even better live. Everyone in the band was nice as well not lofty. They seemed very down to earth. It shows in their music and their love of it when they perform live. If you like classical music and/or metal I highly recommend you just listen to a few of their songs, you will like it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this is a fantastic series.  I really have been enjoying it.  I hope that they make them all.  I am reading the 5th book now.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I got this for my birthday and love it. I read all of the book series and I feel this production is fantastic.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|We rented this so my son could watch it since he saw the pre-views on TV and thought it would be funny.  He is four and he only lasted about 25 mins before he was too scared to continue.  My husband and I finished the movie after the kids were in bed and we liked it but not something we would buy to watch again and again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|cute story but kind of just ends. wish it would have gone a little further into what their lives were like.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I thought this movie was intriguing and kept me interested the whole entire movie! My 6 year old grilled it too!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I lived in New Orleans for awhile and this film really captured the essence of the city and the division of class and race that, in some ways, still exists today.  It's dirty but beautiful and tells a story about life long love and adventure.  One getting older, one getting younger and living events at the opposite ends of the spectrum.  I really enjoy this movie for all the vintage scenery and also for the interesting story.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Definitely reminiscent of older Michael Jackson and others of the funky pop era. Its a good CD without reaching it being great.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is considered sci-fi but I liked this book a lot because it could really happen!  After a catastrophic event a small group of people are living in self-sufficient underground silos.  It is a behind the scenes look at what it takes to keep the peace and continue to live as civilized people.  I'm interested to read more to see where the next book takes the story.  But this is a very entertaining book and makes you realize how easy it would be for this to come true.
B000NMW6M0|2.0|The Japanese part didn't need to be in the move. Not a good connection and it was Weird! The movie was too disjointed, with the Mexico scene really taking place AFTER his wife was shot. Not very clear.
1451695195|5.0|This is a wonderful, uplifting book.  My father is a sceintist and somewhat of a cynic, so I grew up in a pretty close-minded household after my mother (who insisted we go to church every Sunday) died when  I was 14.  I have no doubt that this neurosurgeon's experience is reliable, actually unquestionable.  Someone with that sort of mind and education would never place his reputation with his peers on the line, as Eben Alexander has done, if he did not believe unconditionally that it happened.  It was a lovely experience to read this book.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|From the first time I was introduced to the Honor Harrington character I knew I had to read every story to come. The character has gumption and grit, qualities needed during the conflicts she ends up in.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I've been a fan of Boz Scaggs for quite some time. I've also been a big fan of the Memphis sound, it was always easy for me to recognize the recordings done there...This new Scaggs CD captures that sound using the same studio and many of the same musicians. Boz's voice fits in so well with that vibe...I highly recommended this recording for any ones collection...It's a lesson in understated musical genius !
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It helps me keep track of EVERYTHING I need to do! And cross them off when Im done! Couldn't ask for a better note App.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I have seen thie Celtic Women concert on PBS, and they really put on a great show, anyone who really likes their music should buy the DVD and not just the CD.  Watching their concert is a real joy.
B004IPPINW|5.0|If you're interested in the future with insight a must read. Read both &#34;...Filthy Rich&#34; and ...Fundamentalist together. Require reading.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I sent for this DVD and the Songs From the Heart DVD.  Anyone who enjoys their music would like their DVD's.  Watching the concert is so much better then just having a CD playing on a audio system, I have a 5.1 audio system connected to my 55 inch TV, so watching and listening to their concerts is really enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many useful items on Pinterest!  Great recipes, great information on hundreds of items!!  Also great pictures of everything you can imagine and you can shop...shop....shop!!!
B009CG1106|5.0|We are fans of Phantom of the Opera and have seen it many times in many venues.  This is the best adaptation of the work ever done.  The staging, performers and music are spectacular!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Concise, hour by hour and/or day by day, this app is an excellent source of weather.  You can program various locations for up to the minute weather.  I think this is a great weather app, and so much better than the Weather Channel and other apps available out there.  Highly recommend this one! In
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to listen to the Bible. And the convienance of looking up almost anything I want.<br />Highly Recommended.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Wasn't sure I would like it, but in some ways was better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy because it pieced everything together. Really enjoyed it!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Wash: &#34;Everything looks good from here... (beat...playing with plastic dinosaurs over his console) Yes. Yes, this is a fertile land, and we will thrive.&#34;<br /><br />(as Stegosaurus) &#34;We will rule over all this land, and we will call it... 'This Land'.&#34;<br /><br />(as T-Rex) &#34;I think we should call it...your grave!&#34;<br /><br />(Stegosaurus) &#34;Ah, curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!&#34;<br /><br />(T-Rex) &#34;Ha ha HA! Mine is an evil laugh...now die!&#34;
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded And No Problems On My Motorola Electrify.  WisH It Didn't Have So Many Ads, But I Am To Cheap To Upgrade.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|This movie was cute, I guess, although 'sex buddies' isn't normally what I'd think of as a cute idea.  Ashton Kutcher is just adorable - as usual.  Natalie Portman does a good job playing her character.  However, this is NOT great cinema.  It's entertainment.  And if you are a bit on the conservative side and think pre-marital, casual sex and foul language are turn-offs then DON'T watch it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is perfect for our family cause it is entertaining to all of us, and even my 3 year old can play it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 2 year old loves this game!<br />I'm amazed at how well she plays...she beats me and my kids and me always battle against each other...great game
B0011Z31V8|5.0|Added to many of the greatest hits collection. A definite must have. Brings listening enjoyment and some memories. Would recommend to others.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Perfert for the 17&#34; lap top screen.  The quality is excellent and very durable.  It has great storage space.  Highly recommend.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|A little bit slow getting going, but then one needs to get the story line first. Very entertaining and thought-provoking. Surprising twists as the family trys to get away with their lives. If you are looking for a different movie, this one's for you.
B003K07DUC|4.0|Timely story, reflects my view of reality in that quarter.  Casting was excellent. I would imagine that those who were responsible for establishing the context had the experience to do it effectively.
B004VOBIE8|4.0|It did as it was designed to do, but not what I was looking for. The price was right, free.
B00BYOEZTI|3.0|Excellent acting, wonderful special effects. Unsatisfying plot. Seemed as if story line was written just to show off the special effects and capitalize on the success of the magic Lord of the Rings.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is a must try for anyone who was a fan of the movies and what is really nice about it takes the first movie idea but you can make you creations look like second and third movie.
B0031KE9C6|3.0|Enjoyed the episode; but won't pay the price to watch future episodes. Not so much because the show wasn't well done, the plot or the acting good enough; but because I'm simply too old to qualify as a regular.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book keeps you turning page after page.  Make sure you set aside enough time while you read because you will end up being late if you have to go somewhere because you will not want to put it down.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a quick read, yet it is a very interesting story that I believe the author spent a great deal of time to find the right approach to write the book.  His experience is pretty amazing, but he does not offer any kind of medical details about his recovery and how it was perceived by the medical profession. I would recommend this book, especially for a book club that plans on discussing the topic of life after death, and how that is perceived by the readers.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this show! Never Thought i would like zombies but well.. I do. Can't wait for the next season.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A lovely story about having belief in the magic of life - dreams, fairies, the Easter Bunny, and Santa. It isn't about the religion behind any of this, but rather the results of believing and supporting the good in others through a sense of wonder and joy at everyday happenings around you. It is told in a very lively manner with great action and bits of comedy with a shot of tension from the threads from the bad guy. A whole lot of fun.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I like scary movies and this one fit the bill! It streamed well and i saved a buck or two on my cable bill.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|It's doing it's job.  Protecting as well as making it easy to use on a treadmill or<br />on the couch watch T.V.
B00AAQ7LP6|3.0|10 / 10 video quality, and 7 / 10 sound, unfortunately the sound quality, is not in line with the DVD video part
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written incredible story of humanity I the midst of war. We should all remember we have a higher calling.
B007IK44CK|2.0|I like action films. Cruise has done some wonderful projects like Samurai, Eyes Wide Shut and Interview with a Vampire.  For me, this movie was like trashy comic book material, not a true thriller.  I turned it off aft er a few minutes.  Must give some credit for the technical work and big bucks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really liked this book a lot. I couldn't put it down! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book.
B009AMANBA|1.0|The main thing I learned from this long and somewhat boring movie is that things are still the same in DC. Tommy Lee Jones was great as Thaddeus Stevens, but Daniel Day-Lewis lost me as Lincoln. I also enjoyed Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln and I feel she should have won the Academy Award. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theatre and I wished I wouldn't have wasted money on the DVD.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is like watching 3 movies, not a TV show. Writing, acting, everything is superb. The relationship between Holmes and Watson is done so well here.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the game so far but the neighbor glitches really needs to be fixed. I have lost my neighnors twice and still haven't gotten them back ... uggghhh
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I began my DA journey only 5 days ago - devouring the first season in one night with Netflix - I couldn't help myself!  Then Season 2 was watched over the next 2 days (also Netflix).  Thankfully I found Season 3 on Amazon Instant Video, so now I'm slowing down to savor only one episode per night since it's the final season (so far, fingers crossed!).<br /><br />Some of the plot twists seem a bit contrived, but then again, maybe that's what makes it all the more juicy and addictive.  ;)
B00899F0G8|5.0|ready for the 4th season to become available.<br />watch it on my kindle when nothing on tv, which is most of the time
B009K0P10K|5.0|love the instant  play feature and the choice of what we want to view. nothing could be better for entertainment at home
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|would have been better in paperback form but is a very feasible way to live have tried this way of eating but havent lost a lot yet ..will continue however
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Interesting premise for the story and the animators and voice players managed the feat of humanizing digits very nicely. Well done!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Pros:<br />This securely fits my DLSR camera, lenses, multiple filters and accesssories and an adroid tablet.  There's a pocket for model releases / paperwork / pens, and strap on the side to hold a lightweight tripod. There's enough padding to feel secure and straps to hold the camera and larger lens in place.  It is lightweight and easy to carry.  Fantastic for the hobbyist or nature photographer that doesn't like to lug a zillion pounds of equipment up the hills.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Walking advertisement for Amazon.com since every zipper lanyard has AMAZON.COM printed on it in bright orange and white.  I try not to walk around this world advertising that I am carrying expensive camera equipment, but perhaps I can replace them in time.<br /><br />Overall:<br />A good alternative to a camera bag, and can be carried comfortably.
B0038P59A0|5.0|When I attempt to envision who Sherlock Holmes really was I enjoy the whimsy that this film provides and like to watch it every now and again.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought that this movie was good . It is action packed, suspenseful with a touch of love and romance.<br />Definitely worth the time spent to watch it.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from a &#34;best film&#34; winner and was not disappointed. However, the story's real high points were more than predictable and in the end, I do not subscribe to this film having been placed so high for the year, especially when it was on the same short list as &#34;Lincoln&#34;! Whereas this film had its spare moments one kept looking for the Run Pee spaces. Lincoln, on the other hand placed you squarely in the center of the piece and DDL provided a human look at what the man Lincoln endured at the end of the Civil War. Argo was certainly an entertaining piece but surely not worthy of the award. Ah, but that is Hollywood at its best - but I hope they remember that marketed popularity carries very little beyond the boundaries of LALA Land and the Inland Empire.
B007SGM084|5.0|I know the writing is not the greatest, but the story itself is HOT.  My favorite is book 1. I have read all three books at least 3 times each!!!! I will be reading them again later this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00406O7YK|5.0|We all know and love this classic movie 5 star vote from me, watch it over and over again!! You never know what you will see that you missed the first time! :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this show--period dramas are my favorite.  I also love that I can watch with my kids without wondering if something inappropriate will pop up.  Worth the watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In my opinion it is in need of an update by having lava and water buckets whole world for nether and<br />the classic way yo get to the nether
B005HED08I|5.0|I was curious about the show that has the most devoted fans, so I watched it....and loved it! I love the storylines, the HD is fantastic, and the sets are wonderfully kitschy! I can see why it has so many devoted fans, I feel tense during the entire episode to the end...lets just say i'm glad I don't have to sit through commercials! Great show, just developed a new fan.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My grand-daughter is 3 years old and she absolutely loves this game.  She plants a garden, waters her plants, etcetera.<br />This game keeps her busy for hours.
B0091LS07E|1.0|Really Really should have bought it directly from Amazon though, because the individuals I bought it from on here; SuperCdJoint have absolutely horrid customer service. Will never purchase from them again. They sent my cd to my old address and when the subject was brought up to them, they simply told me that I could wait to see if it was forwarded to me or just take a loss and to file an A-Z claim with Amazon. So, they basically kept my money and I never got the cd. Amazon took care of me but when I addressed their less than great customer service, SuperCdJoint's rep just told me &#34;I'm sorry you feel that way.&#34; Sad...
B0091QSNEE|5.0|This game is great.  My grand daughter loves it and will play for hours.  All of the Dr. Panda's games are great.
B00B5SJEOO|5.0|I have owned this album on both vinyl and cd prior to purchasing this mp3.  Unfortunately both previous versions of this album had been destroyed thanks to mother nature. I have periodically searched for this soundtrack but for some reason the price seemed rather high. Imagine my surprise when I came upon this album for download.  Didn't hesitate purchasing.  The score is by far one of the best ever in cinematic history and just a delight to listen to in general even if one hasn't seen the original movie.  Highly recommend!!!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Being a fan of Jeffrey Archer I was disappointed to find that some scenes/incidents in this book bear a startling resemblance to some of his previous works. Having read almost all his books - and thus far thorougly enjoyed them - it was a great disappointment to find plot turns not at all surprising. While it is still a well written book - not entirely riveting.
B003XT603Q|4.0|The writing style is poetic and philosophical but dark in outlook.  I wish there were more encouraging words in this book.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Rodriguez has been used and abused but is not bitter.  His music represents the working men and women and is great listening.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I missed most of these shows when they were on TV and wanted to see the others.  I liked the suspense of the female terminator, Summer Glau.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Frith will always be my favorite in this story.  All of the cast is great, and the story is timesess. No one could ask for more.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This show, or I should say the whole series had me anchored in my recliner to watch the show every evening.  I like the character Samantha Carter and the half wit Jack O'Neil.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|The movie was trying to be a continuation of \\"Casino Royale\\" which was a great movie.  But \\"Quantum\\" lacks all the things that make a Bond movie great and all the elements of a suspenseful action movie.<br /><br />Rent.  Don't buy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be LAME because the previews SUCKED. But i stand corrected...it was both entertaining and exciting.  I now own the blu ray / dvd/ digital copy combo pack. Furthermore this movie is in my Que for Netflix.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Downloaded it since it was free, but I honestly don't get the appeal. Its too fast paced for me, I'll stick to my casual adventure games.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|If you have a wireless network in your house or apartment and are looking to hook your smartphone or tablet up to your computer without the hassle of a cable, this is the app you want to use.<br /><br />The app will find your wireless router and ask you to sign in. Once signed it the app comes back with an IP address for you to enter into your web browser and connects you to you phone/tablet.  You have all the options you need to go to any file/folder on your phone/tablet. You can move, delete, and rename your files and folders. You also have the option of downloading files from your phone/tablet to your computer and uploading files from your computer to your phone/tablet.<br /><br />The thing I love about this app is that I can still use my phone as a phone while the app is running.<br /><br />Really ... buy it, you'll love it. Honest.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've never really liked English productions or things on PBS.  They're usually so stuffy and boring. But actually I got tired of people ranting and raving about how good this show is. So finally I decided to watch itand see what all the hoopla was all about. They were right...it is wonderful.  I love it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There's nothing like this Bible app! I have it on all my devices (Android phone, Kindle). My wife has it on her Asus tablet. It's very easy to use and I love all of it's features: a wide variety of translations (English and Spanish) at my fingertips; bookmarks; a fantastic selection of reading plans with daily reminders. I use it everywhere (home, work, church)! By far the most valuable app on my phone! &#34;Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.&#34; Psalm 119:97 ESV
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never did Zombie stuff cause I thought they were stupid! Then I decided to watch the marathon before Season 2 started...voila! It was really good. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was made. Thumbs up! Another winner!
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|Well, I thought House of Gold and Bones Part 1 had a little more of what I was looking for out of Stone Sour but, What can I say?  Corey* Taylor* is the man and has never made something that I just cant listen to.  I wasn't a fan of \\"through glass\\" but, we all have our preferences.  This is definitely worth the money for any Stone Sour fan.  Just don't buy this album expecting a Slipknot* sound.  You will be disappointed.  But, overall its a great  album.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was ok. John Goodman was wonderful, always loved his style of acting. It was serious and historical, but not sure how factual it was. Dragged in the middle and hard to follow at times.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|While not all the songs appealed to me they are well done.  My favorites are &#34;Corrina, Corrina&#34;, &#34;Dry Spell&#34; and &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34;
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This series has not disappointed in its creativity and keeping you coming back for more.  The various story lines  keep you guessing as to how they are all going to intertwine especially the dragons and the White Walkers.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to load and easy to use. Love the weather option for the local area and the multiple clock face and sound options. Wish that the digital look could be adjusted to bigger numbers so it is easier to read from across the room, but it is fine within six feet. A good product that loads easily. Also, has multiple alarm sounds. The bell sound  is soft and perfect to wake up to.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I really did not want to read this book, but I knew I had to. It is so important to know what's happening within the awful dictatorship in North Korea and how it affects its inhabitants. There were lines and facts in this book that made me cry uncontrollably, but it was a huge wake up call for me. Yes, it's messy, yes, it's uncomfortable, yes, it's going to take a lot of work, but something has to be done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good works well great for kids :) bad thing is the advertising gets on my nerves . It's a very good awsome game :)
B0049J0CTM|5.0|We have always loved finding Nemo and having the convenience of watching it on Amazon prime is even better. Great characters and a great story, Disney Pixar never disappoints!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this as a back-up when other weather sources are not available and severe weather is in the area.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Just make sure you remove any other Prolific USB/Serial drivers BEFORE you start.  Most of the cheaper cables floating around use a fake prolific chipset that are a pain in the butt to get working.<br />Well worth the price.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Anyone could use this app. It is simpler then most calculator apps!!! I love it! I am 12 and I use it for math homework every day
B007QA3AH2|5.0|A stellar cast - no pun intended.  A smart and funny send up of Star Trek and its continued legacy.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Love it! The 3D effects were very well done and this story is very entertaining for the entire family without any bad words and sexual content. I highly recommend this movie for all viewers. I have watched this movie four times with various family and friends. Buy this movie and share with your family and friends!
B009FZFONO|4.0|I don't know what it is about this season that I didn't love. I think, if I had to pinpoint one main detractor, it would have to be the slower pace--like the producers and director are losing their bearings. I felt like they were falling into the same rut that began to mire down Lost. You know, ungainly plot lines that don't seem to grab any traction. It just felt \\"ham-handed\\", not as graceful (if surviving a zombie apocalypse can be called graceful) as the previous seasons. I used to wait on pins and needles for the next episode but not Season Three. I went several weeks without watching a single show before devouring three or four on my DVR in one sitting.<br />The Walking Dead is still one of the very best TV shows I've ever seen and that's not a claim I make lightly. I love the gritty, heart-wrenching and convincingly realistic portrayals of terrified people eking out a meager existence amidst a ravaged landscape of something far more horrifying than I could ever imagine. And I can't wait for Season Four!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|So what, he lied and is emotionally unstable. He is epic and hilarious and victorious, he can be whoever he chooses as long as he holds up his faulty claims. No good message here but who cares its hilarious.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Game itself is fun (or so says my kid) but won't run on my off-brand tablet (SuperPad II). Force closes before it even gets started.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love playing this game. It is so easy and fun. I had this game on my ipod, but love playing it on a bigger screen.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Though I don't think it was as good as the first season, I really liked it. How can you not like James Cromwell as that character? Or Joseph Fiennes as a priest? The cast was great and the story lines interesting. There were a few too many things going on for my taste. I would have preferred some of the plotlines to be built into their own shows, but that's just me. I really like that each season is its own full story. Each season feels complete.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show. For the most part clean, wholesome and safe for even our teenagers to watch.  No nudity, a couple of implied sexual incidents (between marrieds), and no foul language that I can recall.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this, except more of the same boring copies of other films that the horror film industry has produced lately. But, I really like Ethan Hawke, so I took a chance. Wow, was my assumption was wrong. I really, really liked this movie. I thought I had it figured out from the first few minutes, but was wrong-again. I watch a lot of horror and rarely have a movie stick with me. The filmmakers did a great job giving this film a rich underbelly. It has stuck with me as one of the most interesting horror films I've seen in a long, long time.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl's passion for music can be seen in every part of this video and project. It harkens back to a time when you actually had to be able to write and play an instrument to be successful in the music business. A great story and interesting to see how Dave brought people together to carry on the tradition.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The songs have stayed with me since the first screening and I have seen it five times since the theatrical release.  The movie is powerful and the performances of a star-studded cast are both memorable and surprising.  It is a must-see for history buffs, musical fanatics, and anyone who loves a well-presented story.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Excellent thriller. I read it in only 3 days! Could not put it down. Very well resolved at the end. 100% recommended!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Price was great at $5 for this book. And to have it all in one place is wonderful. Great deal
B008EKMB82|4.0|This has been a captivating and richly textured novel.  There are several stories that deftly intertwine and gently play off each other.  The same holds true with the various characters.  It ends up being a multi-tectured story with a strong pace that keeps you moving to the conclusion.  There are many references to Buddhism, Japanese culture -  these are central to the story and all of the Japanese terms are nicely referenced in the Kindle version. I highly recommend this book - a wonderful read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show. I put off watching this show because initially it didn't peak my interest BUT I am now trying to play catch-up because I realized what I was missing was a great TV show.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A unique search for God, perfectly set up with enough back story to pique your interest, but not so long as to bore you. Excellent direction, great performance by actors little known in this country, stunning cinematography and a lovable tiger to boot. Enjoy!
B005HSL626|4.0|My kids love this , it's easy for them and entertaining for me. it's a good game for mindless entertainment
B00BF11STU|4.0|There is a constant attention getting storyline.  You really get to see how the people behind finding Bin Laden did their job.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|For a story as complex as this, with as many characters as this, it was a well-paced.  By assigning each chapter to the point of view of one character, it really helps Martin juggle the multiple lots in a a manner that is effective and managable for the reader. Martin creates great characters that readers will come to relate to and invest in almost immediately. Can't wait to read the next one.
0956010903|5.0|To package this book in this manner and class is amazing, every detail is just breath taking and astounding to look at and touch for the first time, and every other time that I pick it up. A befitting way to present this book to all the fans as it is what that binds the ending plot of the Harry Potter series together, bring it to the long awaited finale that all the fans will have a love-hate emotion towards it. A dream of all fans to own, happy to have one.
B000FA675C|5.0|Is an amazing Author. Someone once told me that they dont read his books cause its an easy read. My response to that was, Why would I want a book that Im reading to be difficult when Im reading for my own pleasure not for a class?  Everyone is on a different level. My brother hates reading but he loved this book.
B007V4530A|5.0|I learned so much about how to give a brilliant TEDX talk.  The book covered every aspect of a talk. Excellent.  Morty Lefkoe
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the characters, historical backdrop and scenery.  The script writers weave an amazing series of plots. Our whole family loves it!
B00B23O96A|5.0|Eric chooses some old favorites and actually caused me and my boyfriend to start dancing on the patio!  This is a wonderful recording and every song is a treat.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|I have seen a lot of movies like this and this series is one of my favorites. I was so excited when they did the prequal that put all the pieces together
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie's voice is holding strong and this recording delivers her in the the best way.  Isn't it a treat when every song is worthy of listening?
B008I34ZG6|5.0|This is hands down great music from a legendary artist. I wish there more artists out there that aren't afraid to break down barriers and be creative. Also I would like to hear more music similar to this get some long overdue radio play and recognition.
B00633W614|5.0|HardTo put it down.  Friends and famili are equally waiting for the 3rd one in the series. Definitely start with the first novel'
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good story line & action. More like Rollerball in the wilderness. A predictable ending and story line brought it down a bit.
B004OZZ624|3.0|Unrealistic premise.  Found I was watching it but without much enthusiasm.  This is one movie that I can understand never made it big at the movie theaters, if at all.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this show, but I gave it 4 stars, because I felt like it had too many filler moments.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Season 6 was great.  I loved Amy and Rory and all the plot twists.  The Doctor was at his best.
0062238868|5.0|This book was fantastic!! He talked about alot of stuff and there are actually quite a few laughs in there to. I can only imagine what he couldn't talk about after reading this. READ THIS BOOK!!! R.I.P. Chris Kyle
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This was a book that kept my attention up until the very last page. I would recommend this to all
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|cant get it to search 4 any songs, no guide to help.not user friendly, wanted MP3 download app that i have on my phone!!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|You never know what's going to happen next! A surprising thrill ride. I would highly recommend this to people who thinks words are sexy
B005K17RU0|4.0|it seems to be fairly. accurate for my area.  not perfect... but good. I like being able to take a quick look first. thing in the morning.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|A quick, but interesting, read sharing the values and beauty of the people of Botswana.  The author's love of the country is very evident.
0062502174|5.0|the best book to read about life.  You need to study this and apply it to your life daily.  It would benefit anyone.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|This is a movie that you need to pay attention to. The ending is not what you would expect. Can't wait to watch again.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I like this seris...some violence-which is expected, but not too much. The subject is well represented. Good actors, good props and great history
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love this book it's so cute and its more modern for today and would be interesting to see how this would work today
B0076HNCTQ|2.0|I never saw this on TV but now I am glad I missed the whole thing. The dialog is inane and maybe there is a plot, but it was so slow, I could not even finish the first episode.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I just know there were so many things in this movie that were inaccurate, and I found it kind of boring.
B00A8QXSFA|3.0|If your lookin for smokin&#34; & &#34;rockin&#34; progressive blues/jazz, this is not for you. Though the muscianship is superb and the retro 'back home' of Robbens' early jazz roots is quite interesting, this is just not for me.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I thought this movie was really enjoyable. It had great characters and most of the characters were very likeable. It was relaxing and sweet.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I am a Harry Bosch fan and have read all the novels about him. This story didnt have enough of Harry, the person, for my taste. I wish they had delved more into his life with Hannah, does Maddie miss her mother, is she having &#34;teen issues&#34;, does Harry think about retiring. I know he is relentless and must follow cases until solved but I felt there were too many characters that werent interesting and made it hard for me to keep up with them. I have had this downloaded fora couple of months and I just couldn't pick it up and read it. I finished 2 other books in the mean time. I have NEVER had that problem with a Harry B story. I usually finish it within one week.  I look forward to the Mickey Haller book that is coming out later this year because the tease of the first 2 chapters has me already wanting to know what happened.
0345803507|5.0|Love it - read all three in three days...You can't put it down, hope there are more books to come like this
B0056C6XIA|5.0|I chose this prestigious rating because the Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Pack is perfect for you true hunter/gatherer aficionados. No one likes to use two sticks to start a fire, and this bad boy makes the process so effortless that you'll have enough time build a mansion for a shelter while simultaneously skinning the rabbit you just trapped, thanks to the snare techniques provided in the mini survival handbook. Accompanying this little package of delights, is a compact LED flashlight that will efficiently illuminate your path as you head through the woods to find a safe 'download' location for that delectable rabbit kebab you put down hours before. The flashlight will still illuminate while holstered, thanks to the super-sweet hole cut out of the multi-tool casing. This will leave your hands free whilst scouting your terrain, just in case you have to judee-chop a bear or ninjee-chop a hippopotamus. Long story short... buy this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode is better than the next.  I love the wardrobes, history and every evolving character development.  Can't ever watch just one episode so having the whole series at my fingertips is fantastic.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|This is a great movie if you have low expectations. It's possible that it's one of those movies that is funnier the second time.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Actors are as good as they get. The story is real and very sad. Makes you want to slap somebody.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would have a difficult time choose between The Walking Dead and American Horror Story as my favorite series because both are outstanding.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Good flick, tension, drama, will watch it again for sure. That's my review but will waste some more space here because it's required.
0307387178|5.0|Krakauer brilliantly tells the tragic and true tale of the life and death of a privileged yet flawed young man who turns his back on his own promising future to pursue his independence. His decision eventually cost him his life. Everyone should read this work.
B00BESFWBY|3.0|No amount of beautiful sunsets or thunderous beach scenes can compensate for awkward writing delivered by mediocre acting over too long a period of time...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am an unconditional reader of Ken Follett's books ... and this one is particularly good.  I just loved it!  Can wait for the third book.
0861714911|5.0|This is a fantastic book. The way it's written should makes anyone able to jump right in. It's a perfect introduction to Buddhism in a whole and I recommend anybody wishing to learn more about the practice to grab this book. The shipping was also convenient and the product itself is without any markings or folds
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I often jumped the sex in the playroom... ;-) but the love story was quite nice even though a little far fetched.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|Pleasantly surprised, scary and suspenseful; a bit predictable, but better than any other \\" horror\\" flick I´ve seen in a while. I recommend it.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I do not like, too hard to follow, i don't use facebook cannot advance into game Don't enjoy at all
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Hands down the best keyboard app ever<br />-Simple to use<br />-Should be androids stock keyboard<br />-you can customize it with different languages
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Epic Cinema Entertainment. The Blu-ray disc release date for November 13, 2012 is Amazing! Colors! Details! Clarity! and the Movie Story is enthralling. A Must have.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Excellent movie, today's society should be required to watch this video on how our behavior can affect others in our daily lives.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|it was a good movie wish there was more on the story of wallis and edward,it focused more on the present couple
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's tiny! Smaller than I expected, but it's a great working tool! It brought my knife back to life, it's easy to use, fits in a pocket and performs great in a pinch. Be careful when using it because there are no safety features!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this visual and mental challenge.  As a new Kindle Fire HD owner, I look forward to using this app every day.
B0095P33IW|5.0|One of my favorites. Great movie. This was a well made movie for this new generation. Looking forward to part 2.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit that I have only a peripheral knowledge of our 16th President.  However, I can definitely say that I came away from the movie not only entertained, but a little more knowledgeable regarding the abolishment of slavery and the president who made it happen. Unfortunately, my husband found the legislative dialog boring (and there's quite a bit), but he's more of an action/adventure kind of fella, and this is a quietly powerful movie where you really need to immerse yourself in the point, the underlying thread, see just how significant this movie is.  And, of course, there's Daniel Day Lewis...I never, for one second thought at any time of the movie, &#34;There's Daniel Day Lewis playing Abraham Lincoln,&#34; as he truly mastered the character.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|An older film which I revisited to see again and enjoyed it just as much. Very absorbing and heart-breaking story. I will probably watch it gin some day. Seeing a very young Liam Neesom was something I had forgotten from the first viewing..
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It give you step-by-step to building your book but nothing about helpful about how to deal with what you find when you go past saving it as a draft. I havent done that yet but I'd like to know something about thte decidions I'll be faced with before I do. The book doesn't tell me.<br /><br />Also, their previewers are troublesome. The on-line one and the download one gives different behaviors for the same device and I have to hope they are buts in the previewers and not the real reader software. An example is that for some of the devices an italic paragraph loses italics when continuing on the next page. First-line indents of the Table of Contents also happen sometimes and sometimes don't. (They're not indented in my HTML file.) In one case the first link isn't but the resta are.
B006LSZECO|5.0|All the twists and turns in the plot had me struggling to put this book down.  Characters were well developed, and just when you started feeling sorry for, or frustrated by one of them, the author changed direction and had you reconsidering.  The ending left me wanting more though... maybe there will be a sequel?
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|But a good movie for those of us with Kindles who have to sit in a Laundromat and kill time in the name of personal hygiene.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a very insightful book that explores habits and behaviors from different and diverse views.  Starting with scientific, daily routines and great examples on team work and leadership applications that fully describe the power behind habits.  Really a very good lecture, I fully recommend this book!
B001D09OAI|5.0|Great movie one of the best i could watch this movie again and again. Such a good one. Love it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Having all the books at once fed my hungry reader habit of finishing books so quickly. The book is much better than the movie due to the amount of depth and character growth, not to mention it tells the story a whole lot better and doesnt forget about important characters.<br /><br />I would get this again in a heart beat
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a good book to read especially during the winter...Book one held my interest from start to finish...It ended abruptly and I had to know what happended after Ana left Christian...So I ordered book 2 on my kindle fire and kept on reading...I am now reading book three and it still holds my interest...Only down side for me is there is way to much sex...but then I guess that's what fifty shades is all about...but if you want a good read and can tolerate all of the sexual escapated then by all means this book is worth the read....
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I liked it, plenty of action and the story was good. It movie underlining story was about how James Bond came to know Miss Moneypenny and the head of MI 6 that everyone knows throughout the past movies. My opinion give it another try.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie held my interest from start to ending.  It was a great show.  It wasn't like all the other snow white movies you usually see.  It was unique, a style of it's own.  I do recommend this.  The acting was great by all the actors.  Very Satisfied.
B008ASLQZW|3.0|It was a hollywood sequel not worthy of the first movie. I loved the original movie, but the follow up was just done to make money. the story was stupid and cheesy.
0553801473|5.0|I just received this today.  I wanted to cry.  I love my books.  This books was poorly packed, therefore, I have a beat up book and book cover.  The cover is bent up in quite a few places.  The Book, my main concern, has a dent and a rip in the top front left hand side.  The dent is about and inch and a half long.  There is also a dent the same length in the upper right hand corner.  The bottom front left hand corner is bent in, the bottom front right hand corner is bent in.  On the back, the book is bent in on the lower left hand corner and and the lower right hand corner.  I take good care of my books and I would expect a book that I buy brand new would look as such.  I will, from now on, order a book by it's self and see if it gets packed better.  Although, I should not have to do so.  I do hope Amazon does something about this problem.  My book was not protected at all.  This was not right.  I will update and let you know how I like the reading of the book soon.  Do Not recommend buying this book with other products.<br />May 9, 2013: I am writing an update on my book review.  The book was a great read.  I loved it.  It was hard to put down.  I am anxious now, for the next one.  There are lots of characters, but he (the author) makes it easy to keep up with them. He does so by Putting a title on each chapter that has to do with that person.  So, if you forget something, it is easy to go back and remind yourself.  I love all of these books
B008CPBB0I|4.0|Just a nice wholesome movie that the everyone will enjoy and it is based on true events too, that awesome!
B00004UEDQ|2.0|Very disappointed in this.  I don't know if it has to do with the poor packaging, or the factory, but only one end will clip shut the other stays apart.  I haven't watched the movie yet.  I do hope it is not damaged.  I believe these DVD's need more attention than they are getting in packing.  I take good care of things I purchase(no matter where from).  I expect it to come to me like it is new at least.  If it gets torn up after that, that is my fault.  I do not recommend this if this matter doesn't get taken care of.  The clip at the top is broken, therefore the DVD box does not shut at the top.  Just figured that out.  The clip was inside of the DVD Box.  Doesn't help me, but at least I see that it got broke somehow.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This is by far the best music i have ever listened to. I know it sounds like im over stating it but this music has a great force to it. with every boom i sense that im punching some poor grunt in the face or coasing some giant explosion in multiplayer.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I have played every single temple run game; temple run, temple run 2, temple run brave, and this. This is my favorite though. Every other version all you do is duck, jump, and turn. In this one you can do many other things. For example, you can go to the wimsie woods OR the dark forest.<br />  I've seen the movie and this game is exactly like it. It is AWESOME!<br />The only bad part is that the character is different looking, and in the other games you can change your guy, in this you can't.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ayoo mayne dis gucci right che. It got hookups and all dat goood stuff. Like really thooo!! Who don be madin dis??? Dey ritch rigght right??
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never falls short of amazing.  This book was incredible and always captivating.  Once I started I couldn't put it down!
B007SGM084|5.0|A good late night read! Didn't want to put the books down have read all three twice now. Love love love!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is awesome. I love this game. Very addictive. I play this game for hours at a time everyday
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It would be nicer if it was easier to get money and gems but overall I love it and Give it 5stars.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love it.  why do I have to say more? I do wish I had a pin it button on my kindle like I have on my computer browser.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Try it. Some episodes are better than others, but the acting is great and the pacing is quick.  The stories and the series arc is really interesting.  For lovers of science fiction (or X-files without the aliens) this is for you.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, it reminds me of mario at the game room. challenging and enjoyable. would recommend this game
B00BETX5PS|3.0|If you are really into James Bond and special effects perhaps this will be for you. To me just seemed like one long chase scene, interspersed with ridiculous shoot outs and fights.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, it reminds me of galica at the game room. challenging and enjoyable. would recommend this game
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun, addictive match three game with different play modes so lots of play time. Gets harder as you progress. Easier than Jewels Legend.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It reaches but the basic story line is a good read.  Difficult to imagine being left behind with all of the problems one would face.
B0007OY2P8|5.0|this was a very good movie and I enjoyed all of it.  Gives one a real feel for that period of time.  LUCY
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I had the free version of this game, This one seems to play much better, with less lag and it does not put near the strain on my phone's battery as the ad-supported version.
0062080237|4.0|I'm not going to give a synopsis of this novel, or a 'review'.  But I will say - that it is a great read and will be appreciated by anyone who enjoys fantasy or scifi.  Mr. Gaiman's a gifted man in his style and imagination.  I'm looking forward to reading Anansi Boys!
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|I'm very satisfied with this product, however the only thing is that because I live in Germany (military) I can not have access to the Ultraviolet digital copy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the ability to calculate and keep my equations on my machine and be able to review what I've done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am obsessed with pinterest and love having the app right on my kindle! Now I just need to stop pinning so much lol
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoyed his take on the NDE experience.  Well written.  A bit comprehensive in his medical analogy but nothing that one could not follow.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I was leery about this movie but it was something my girls wanted to see.  It was cute the first time I saw it and better than I expected.  The second time I saw it, it was 'catchy'.  Now it has really grown on me and I absolutely love it.  It is cute, sweet, funny, even if it is a little cliche'.  We have watched it over and over on our movie nights and we have every line in the movie memorized, so it makes it fun to mock it a little.  It is definately a teenage girl movie, but it grows on the parents too.
0307474275|1.0|I knew I wouldn't take to the storyline of this novel but I was shocked at how monstrously boring it is.  I had to skip and skim just to get through it, and at the end it went straight into the bin.  Wow.  What was all the fuss about?  No characterisations to speak of; the plot was infantile, to be generous; and the style could be bettered by a good 12 year old writer.  Really, if you think this makes for good reading, please broaden your horizons.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome, didnt like having to pay 28.00 though.  Just couldn't wait on it coming out through netflix or anything else
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is such a great movie.  Hugh Jackman leads this story from start to finish and you may never think of wolverine again.  Looks great, sounds great, acted and directed well.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|He had a message and delivered it in his typical Springsteen and E Street Band style  He just keeps getting better. I am a fan.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I am glad I didn't pay for this.  Just didn't like it at all, don't need gravity to hit the mark.  Removed shortly after installing.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Riveting concert Bruce Springsteen always gives you the fan all he has to give.  I have several of his live concerts and have never been disappointed
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is one of the best movies.  Great plot, animation, and voices. Looks great, and of course a good message, but I really enjoyed it.
B00005R23S|5.0|Riveting concert Bruce Springsteen always gives you the fan all he has to give.  I have several of his live concerts and have never been disappointed
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but it exceeds all expectations.  The casting was perfect, story good.  Will watch again.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|This remake of the classic movie that starred Arnold Schwartzenegger is watchable - you won't be asking yourself why did you bother. But, if you're a fan of the original be prepared for a new plot. This version follows the trend of remakes completely changing the story and plot of the original. That's fine if the new story is better than the original, but for me that wasn't the case here. Jason Momoa did a good job, but I think he was too small to play Conan. He should have bulked up for the role or they should have cast someone whose size would have been more convincing.
B007N85POS|5.0|I like this better than the original.  Some easy, some hard, keeps you entertained. I have  tried some other angry birds and just removed them shortly after installing, just keep playing this one.
030758836X|4.0|Currently this book sits at the top of the bestseller list and for good reason. This is a fast paced psychological thriller that appeals to the masses. We have seen this story play out on television at least once a year. Boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy gets tired of girl, girl goes missing (on their 5th Anniversary no less). The couple has money troubles, family troubles, relationship troubles, and now she could be pregnant. How convenient. Do not think for one minute that you have this book figured out, because you most likely will not. It is fun to guess, but it is best to roll with the punches.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn keeps the reader entertained and the story moving through short chapters and prose that is mostly dialogue or action. There are not a lot of descriptive elements in this novel and I feel that it is not really needed for this genre. I do not want to give too much away so I will offer this final thought in the style of Amy Elliott Dunne:<br /><br />Husbands, you are seeking the perfect gift for your bookwormy wife for a special occasion, you:<br /><br />A) Pick up a copy of Gone Girl, it is on the bestseller list it must be good.<br />B) Buy her a Jane Austen novel. Women love to read Jane Austen novels.<br />C) Find out her favorite author and purchase a book by that author.<br />D) Get her a gift card so she can choose.<br /><br />And the answer is....D) Although it may be impersonal she will appreciate the thought!<br /><br />If you choose B) she may not like Austen, and C) she may have already read the book you give her. Why not A)?? Well, this is not really a good \\"I love you\\" book. The people in the book are completely and utterly messed up. If you get her the gift card she could choose to buy the book herself and then she will not worry that you might be sending her mixed messages.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|I didn't see this on the big screen because by the time you get to the 3rd it's played out. Well they made me care about woody and buzz all over again.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|No other president has done what Lincoln has done for our country.  So well done. This was our 2nd viewing and  will definitely watch it again!
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Just love this movie, the cast is great, Christopher Nolan is a great story teller.  The ending is breathtaking.  You really need to pay attention, no getting up during this one.
B000YDAYW2|5.0|Very comfortable boots,  look nice, and extremely light weight!  Feels like you have a pair of Jordan slippers on!  They run big like every other timberland boot so if ur a 11us get a 10 and that will be perfect unless u wear thick socks so get 10& a half
B00BB67UNW|3.0|Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a policeman who murders a killer/rapist who has escaped the criminal justice system. He gets off using a self defense plea, however the mayor (Russell Crowe) has evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />We jump to seven years later. Billy, now a private detective, is living with the sister (Natalie Martinez as Natalie) of the victim of the man he killed. Natalie is an actress who is excited about her up and coming indie movie debut. Note to self: If you get naked in a film and make love to a man, tell your boyfriend before he sees it.<br /><br />Meanwhile Billy is asked by the crooked mayor to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who he believes is having an affair. It is an election year and he is running against young Connecticut carpetbagger Jack Valiant (Barry Pepper). Billy takes photos of the mayor's wife and Jack's campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) together. BTW the police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) doesn't like the mayor either.<br /><br />This early twist sets things up for later twists as Billy finds himself in over his head with feuding factions while trying to cope with his newly broken relationship.<br /><br />This film left me unfulfilled. Russell Crowe didn't sing, which is a plus. The characters were stiff and the dialouge stale. This is just another \\"me too\\" crime drama. Wait for the rental.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb. Quick on screen sex scene, which may of had some even quicker nudity.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book, I was already a fan of Colleen Hoover because of Hopeless but Slammed has officially pushed her to #1 on my fav authors. This doesn't sound like a debut novel, she sounds like she has been writing for years. To have so much emotion put into one novel is exhilarating because you just want to keep reading until you finish and then you immediately want to start the next. I was telling everyone I knew about this book and how awesome it was, so I would definitely recommend it. Read this book!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|my grandkids watch this on a daily bases. so much so that they wore out the first disc. I'm now looking forward to finding other discs in this story line/
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing loved it from the beginning to the end. I would definitely read this book all over again.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Entertaining and and at the same time emotionally moving!  I encourage Eastwood fans to take time to view it...you'll like it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey, Season 3, is entertainment of the highest calibre.  I cannot praise it highly enough. Looking forward to Season 4.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A wonderful current day thriller with great descriptions of New York and San Francisco. A fabulous look at a literary secret society! A can't put down read!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is clearly one of the BEST apps that I have on my smart phone.  Don't walk, but run and order it! I have a subscription to Sirius and Pandora, but I tend to listen to this one more! Keep up the good work!
B00136JS12|5.0|I had owned this on cassette tape. At one point I had it transferred to MP3. It's sooooo nice to hear the quality of these downloaded files compared to what I was listening to.
B00271HAK8|5.0|This movie broke the mold, it incited parental outrage and it inspired a whole generation of youth...This is a must watch!!!
B001223BLU|4.0|I love music of all kinds form all eras. This one covers a lot of famous music from these guys. Was definitely worth the price for what it has to offer.
B00A7KKPDK|1.0|First of all, I love Ellen, love her show etc.  But the book was by far the most boring book I have ever read.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I already had this on an older cd. In turn, I also had it in my itunes ripped cd's. I got this download when it was on sale. WOW, the sound in comparing the two is amazing. This remaster is much better than the cd I had from many years ago. Was worth the rebuy.
B000YN369A|3.0|As a Death Cab fan, I was hoping this release from The Postal Service would be a little more fulfilling than it turned out to be. The songs are nicely crafted synth based ditties. But for me, they lack the complexity and depth of the best of Death Cab. So I'd say this is a pleasant collection of appealing pop music, and if your a big time Ben Gibbard, you'll probably enjoy it, but I was hoping for a little more.
B000SZK41M|5.0|This movie is a great compromise on a Saturday night.  My husband loves the action and I love Alan Rickman.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really loved this quirky book. It is so different from anything else I have read. I learned so much about the &#34;language of flowers&#34;
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WOW! I didn't expect to like this book so much but I was pulled in by the love story underneath all the kink. This trilogy was sexy, frustrating, endearing, and satisfying. I would probably get a restraining order in real life against a guy like Christian but as a fictional character...so hot!!!  I Already recommended this to everyone I know.
0811876373|4.0|Gave this as a gift, have had several cakes out of it sence all were delightful, would send this to anyone who likes to bake for the kids.
B009FZFONO|5.0|We didn't start watching it until this year, but once we started, we watched all three seasons in a  week...Can't wait for Season 4...!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Although it did not meet my expectations after comparing it to another book that I thoroughly enjoyed, I found it to be entertaining and chock full of humor. The plot is interesting and the characters are unique, which makes for a good read.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie was original and refreshing.  Our kids (7 and 3) enjoyed it, as did mom and dad.  We actually watched it again the same day because we liked it so much.  It was a little scary in parts for our little one, but she still wanted to watch it again, so it must not have been too bad.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved this product because it came in a very timely manor and was brand new . The cost was also very reasonable
B009CF3P7E|4.0|I like the alternate  story line that can now be written  because of the change in historical events.  .  Making Spock a little more human really adds to the movie and numerous plots can now be written with this history of characters.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|After you get past it making sense it does.<br />Has a good underlying story line. Out there somewhere we are all quirky!!<br />Thought provoking. Funny!!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. This book takes you through so many emotions. Glad it had a good ending. I thought that the author uses the f word a little too Much in her books though
B0027GGL6W|4.0|Fine, if fictionalized and compressed, history of the rise and decline of Chess Records. Urban blues of the 40's & 50's, with Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Little Walter & Etta James. The rise of rock & roll with Chuck Berry. Through it all, Leonard Chess promoting, cheating and manipulating his artists. Surprisingly good performance by Beyonce as Etta James. Music is terrific!
B00ATCIPQA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, nice to see from a person of science point of view.  It is a good read.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The characters are great.  I LOVE Walter, the offbeat genius. The plot line is full of twists and turns making this is an entertaining, addictive series.
B004UPALT6|5.0|I love this movie! I watch it over and over again. Cult classic and no one can remake it and be better.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a well written book by a former skeptic.  I find his experience to fit with things that I have believed but not experienced.  Very insightful into matters of the spirit.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|i liked the movie. the ending could had been better. other then that. awesome. wanted more info from the story
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like this game.  It makes you think fast.  Not hard to play but exercises your brain. three more words
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great movie. My girlfriend and I saw that film and she she didn't have high hopes. However, w/o being a spoiler, there is a specific theme within the movie that only comes out at the end and just like smacks you in the head. Very powerful movie. Good film for parents to see with older kids because there are themes that parents may have issues with, but totally worth for the sake of a family discussion.
B005HSL626|5.0|I liked this game.  It is pretty addictive and my grandkids like it too.  It was fun to compete for best score.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|The movie was definitely funny, but could have been a half hour shorter and have been just as good. Overall I liked it
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was amazing. It was a hotter version of Fifty Shades. I cannot wait to read the next book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a great story and I love the characters.  I streamed this using the Amazon instant video through my Blu-ray player and had no problems so thank you to Amazon.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|It is amazing to be able to print a document from my phone. And it is so easy to do.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Excellent movie. All the actors were superb. Honest and vivid acting. I was very surprised how good this movie was. I hadn't heard about it before watching. Rented it because Helen Hunt is a favorite actress.  The subject matter was handled gracefully and tenderly.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great value! I've had this watch for a couple of months and it's kept time perfectly, I've only had to set it once when I first took it out of the package. I cannot think of a negative thing to say about this watch. I absolutely love it. Shipped quickly and conveniently.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a fine program. We are totally hooked. The acting is superb and the storylines are riveting.<br />Don't miss it.
1423124111|5.0|After traveling to all the Disney Parks (except Hong Kong)--I love seeing the posters of  the parks (love the Tokyo ones!). I've been going to Disneyland since the early 60's--and this book is a treasure with old and new posters of attractions and shows --many long gone, some still here to enjoy.
0439023483|5.0|found this @ good price here; decided to order it for my son that wanted to read this book for a book report @ school; he enjoyed it very much
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I wanted this movie to be funny but I was very disapointed.  I thought with the cast that was in this movie it would've had more of a punch but it never got off the ground.
B008602KQI|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Although it was well made, and the acting, along with the story were good, it has a thoroughtly sick base.  All i can think is that this should serve warning to society that we need to never fall into this kind of situation.  But really, what kind of society would use its children as entertainment, derived from their need to be fed?  Kind of sick
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I am not a Glee fan so I wasn't sure how I would like this movie but I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought that it was very entertaining and it had lots of touching parts.  I really liked this movie
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|The disc is in french. The case itself looks like it was made of poor quality. I honestly think that this is a pirated copy. The quality is that bad.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|It's no mean feat to make a gripping movie about democracy's legislative process but Spielberg has managed to do it. Gripping and relevant, Lincoln shows the mess of a people compromising in pursuit of their ambitions and their most sacred ideals. The saccharine moments are kept to a minimum, as we are presented with a portrait of a complex man who has been largely marbleized through the years. Here we have Lincoln the dawdler. Lincoln the compromiser. Lincoln the southerner. A manipulator not above subterfuge. Even with all his imperfections, you can still be left astonished.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Beautiful, informative, and overall breathtaking.  I love watching documentaries.  I did find some of the narration to be dull at times, but it picked back up quickly.  Highly recommended!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Everyone knows Thrift Shop and Can't Hold Us will be another great hit, yet the rest of the songs are still incredible with some very deep messages.  I had flashbacks to middle school listening to Wing$ and themes like Same Love (great video) are quite timely for today.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I read as a diversion and this was a fun read. I was relieved it wasn't a romance novel ~ some books can fool ya sometimes.<br />I'll probably read more of her books.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Made me appreciate how decisions affect self and others. Well made movie with great sound track. You won't be disappointed.
1608871517|5.0|I enjoyed the book. I like the author. Good read as well. I brought the book for the content from the authors point of view. I loved the pictures and the discussions regarding the items. Thank you very much
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|I'm very glad I didn't pay to see this is a theater. I would have been very bummed. The movie was not interesting, and also very strange.
0062238310|5.0|I really enjoyed this. it cleared up a few lingering questions. When watching the show on TV I sometimes found that the actor's accent and soft spoken voice were hard for me to understand. I would read this again and agian!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless has a plot like no other. The twists and turns keep the reader engulfed. A perfect blend of happiness and sAdness.
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|Build quality is cheap. The screws get loose easy, so always have tools handy. However, if you know what you are doing, this compact steadycam can get you some nice shots. Initial balancing took me three hours and minor adjustments have to be made during shooting, especially when you are outside and it is slightly windy. For beginners, I would recommend this product, so that in the future, you will be ready for real stabilizers.
0399160450|5.0|I've been a Tom Clancy reader for about 20+ years. This book was worth the wait (pre-ordered it), and I'm only disappointed in the idea that it's all coming to an end. No one lives forever, but Tom Clancy and his Jack Ryan series is as good as it gets. Clancy brings you into the lives of the people in his books and weaves the story around them so well it seems real. I, as a reader, am trapped in the web till the book is done being read. Classic Clancy, in every way.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|After playing the first game the other four lives disappear and you have to wait for your lives to recharge or buy more
B001ENOB8Y|4.0|I got hooked on this show after a co-worker suggested it.  This isn't a full review, as you can already find plenty of those here, but I do want to comment on the show's thrill factor as it went on.  The crux of this show lies in its strength, the thrills in each episode with surprise and cliffhangers abound.  Unfortunately, the writers have to keep up the thrill, cliffhanger, and surprise count, and they definitely ran out of ideas for ways to do that as the show went on.  Someone always has a family member threatened, someone always gets the drop on another character, only for someone else to later get the drop on them.  After Michael escapes the first prison, there always something else for him to escape, and when he's making those escapes, there's always something that doesn't go according to plan.  The predictability of the next set of thrills increases as the same mechanics to create them are recycled.  Now, that doesn't mean I wasn't entertained (I watched the whole show in an embarrassingly short amount of time), but I do have to admit that as Season 4 went on I found myself waiting to watch the end more for the sake of seeing what finally happens rather than looking forward to the next set of thrills.  I rate the show overall as a 4/5, so don't think that I'm being too harsh.  I did enjoy learning more about the main characters as the show winded down.  I found myself pulling for characters I previously disliked and later feeling sorry for T-Bag.  I am still slightly confused about what the company was up to and wondering about what Michaeld did for Westmoreland's family, but I'm happy with the send-off everyone got.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Being a big fan of Cirque and having many DVD's in my collection, it was a fantastic movie when we saw it earlier in the year and just couldn't wait until it was released on DVD... so having ordered it and receiving same, put it on and watched it as soon as it arrived...IT WAS JUST AS FANTASTIC AT HOME AS IT WAS AT THE MOVIES. Just a little snippit of shows that I have seen live and also some I haven't seen and now hope to in the future. Only complaint is that would have liked to have seen more than one section of Viva Elvis and now hope that as it  is no longer is playing in Vegas, then perhaps Cirque might release it as well.
0307463745|5.0|This book is simply amazing. That's it!  Shows how the \\"common practices\\" in the companies are nothing more than bulls***...
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Best game in the world I was along time fan and I'm not gonna stop now this game has great graphics and its amazing on the kindle fire to all you scribblenuats fans out there..rock on and keep on play in!!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I loved it but noted several things that would make it better for me: It was difficult to move the 'shark' and I would also give more coins/points for eating people. Overall it was an excellent game.
0375842209|5.0|I had read this book before ordering, from a borrowed copy.  After reading I ordered three copies; one for myself and two to give as gifts.  I think that adequately describes how much I enjoyed the book.
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|The show was good. A lot of vulgar language. Shows African Americans as slaves so if these type of shows offends you then this show is not for you.
B005D4YHXE|5.0|Absolutely love these sandals they fit my big feet perfectly.  They arrived before I expected them so that was a bonus!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|i tend to buy movies cause when ever the cable goes out i have movies to watch lol good movie to watch, i wondered how the movie would've looked like if spiderman was in it. lol
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Great writer. Great ideas. You don't have to agree with everything he says to enjoy reading this book. His concepts of fragile and anti-fragile will be useful to people who work in a variety of domains. The addition of the notion of antifragile to the lexicon will elevate conversation.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|A well done and visually incredible movie (too bad the second movie wasn't quite as good and the last one stunk!)
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad my daughter's friend told me about this game.  It's not the type of game I usually play, but one try and I was hooked on the non-stop action.  I love this game!!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I downloaded this because I thought it was free, but the free part only last for so many 'lives' and then you have to buy more...disappointed that I can't just play for free without dumping more money into a game that is just meant to kill some time.
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|It was hard for me to rate this album on just the first listen.  My thoughts on what this CD contained were heavily influenced by the pre-released songs that I listened to on the radio and via free download just this last week.  What I ended up downloading was quite the surprise and sobering at the same time.  Volbeat has a style of music that at it's core has been fundamentally unchanged and remains so (this is not a bad thing).  From my limited anecdotal experience of inviting my friends to experience Volbeat's sound there has been either a love or hate relationship with the music that they produce.  In the end this band is one that has shown, without a doubt, that they will experiment with the music that they create and they are not afraid of doing so.  But they always have the same signature.<br /><br />I have heard pre-release conjecture of this CD compared to Spaghetti Western Metal.  I think that is an apt and resolute definition.  And herein lies my issue with the album.  It just exudes overly \\"experimental\\" to me.  The beginning of the album is quite fitting to this categorization.  And then you come upon the middle tracks. To me they deter from the overall experience of the album.  The so called \\"radio\\" tracks.  And sadly those tracks are my current favorites.  I still gave this album a 4/5.  I may change this as I continue to listen to the album but that is where my thoughts reside, in the now.  For listening to the featured tracks alone result in a sense of disconnect.  I am not saying that both styles do not have merit, because they do, but listening to \\"Room 24\\" draws a succinctly different experience than \\"Lonesome Rider\\".  Coincidentally those happen to be my two favorite songs on the album so far.<br /><br />Am I disappointed?  No.
B004D20JP2|2.0|Story is slow with antiquated animation, it was difficult to watch and not get board! I wouldn't recommend spending the time to watch.
B001KT6JPA|3.0|Excellent pilot that had me gripped from start to finish. Hoping the rest of the series is as good as the first episode.<br /><br />Update 8/14: The series got boring and repetitive after the first few episodes. Downgraded to 3 stars.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I never thought I would enjoy this type of show, but have become hooked!  I had knee surgery and was recuperating and started watching the series.<br />Would recommend the whole series because it has action scenes, heartfelt moments, great overall story line and the dramatic moments are very believable.  The show and actors are underrated and I wish this wasn't the case.  If more people watch this series, they would realize how underrated it has been and should be appreciated more.  I've recommended this to my brother, daughter and some friends and they have all been hooked!<br />Worth checking out!
1594484805|4.0|When it comes to motivating people on the job, what is the most common approach? It's the carrot-and-stick. But Daniel Pink makes a case that what science knows and business does are two entirely different things. Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us was an interesting read about how studies have shown that autonomy, mastery, and purpose are the real drivers of motivation in today's world, and business needs to shift their practices to account for this change.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Introduction<br />Part One - A New Operating System: The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0; Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work...; ... and the Special Circumstances When They Do; Type I and Type X<br />Part Two - The Three Elements: Autonomy; Mastery; Purpose<br />Part Three - The Type I Toolkit: Type I for Individuals - Nine Strategies for Awaking Your Motivation; Type I for Organizations - Nine Ways to Improve Your Company, Office, or Group; The Zen of Compensation - Paying People the Type I Way; Type I for Parents and Educators - Nine Ideas for Helping Our Kids; The Type I Reading List - Fifteen Essential Books; Listen to the Gurus - Six Business Thinkers Who Get It; The Type I Fitness Plan - Four Tips for Getting (and Staying) Motivated to Exercise; Drive - The Recap; Drive - The Glossary; The Drive Discussion Guide - Twenty Conversation Starters to Keep You Thinking and Talking; Find Out More - About Yourself and This Topic<br />Acknowledgments; Notes; Index<br /><br />Pink does a good job in tying together scientific research and practical business application. There has indeed been a generational shift in the workforce, but little change (by and large) in how organizations motivate their workforce. The differences between industrial/assembly line work and knowledge work are many, and it's not surprising that incentives for assembling widgets don't work quite as well on those who are building creative solutions to problems. But as Pink points out, the status quo of how people are motivated to work harder hasn't been questioned as part of that change.<br /><br />While the book runs 240 pages, the core content only takes up slightly more than half that space. The toolkit section at the end takes his autonomy/mastery/purpose concepts and draws some applications to actual real-life areas (and not all business-related, either). You could make the argument that it's padding to something that would be a much smaller book, but I see it more as a built-in reader's guide to the content. I especially appreciated the chapter summaries he provides as a way to spur my memory on the essential points.<br /><br />Drive is worth reading if you're running a business or you're in charge of employees and staff. Even though you might still be constrained in being able to implement some of these ideas on a large scale, it will provide food for thought and has the potential for improving the productivity and motivation of those you lead.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedhe status quo of how people are motivated to work harder hasn't been questioned as part of that change.<br /><br />While the book runs 240 pages, the core content only takes up slightly more than half that space.

B008602KQI|4.0|Inspite of my hesitation of watching a movie where kids kill each other, to my surprise I enjoyed the movie. The character development was good and to my relief the violence wasn't too graffic which I thoroughly appreciated.  It was definitelly an entertaining movie with a unique plot that has captured my attention. I'm now tempted to read the books for all the details a movie just can't capture in a two hour timespan. I'm looking forward to the second movie.  The reason for four rather than five stars is that most, not all, plot developments are  cliche keeping it a rosy movie for the masses but detracting from having any real impact on the movie watcher.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Before the upgrade this was one of the greatest apps on my Kindle Fire (1st gen).  The upgrade turned this app into a mess.  Difficult to navigate it does not display the columns of info correctly in portrait mode.  Got so frustrated I deleted it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I could hardly wait to see each episode.  The scenery is wonderful and the characters are believable and fascinating.  I recommend it to everyone.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Good movie award winning not so much. Daniel, Sally and Tommy Lee great job but not award winning.It's just okay.
B00271B752|5.0|An American Classic based from A True Story......anyone enjoy The French Connection? Also based from a true story. If you did then Serpico is right up your alley!
B000GWE44U|4.0|After seeing this movie for probably the 10th time in my life, it has lost some of it's ability to scare but still offers more than a few chills and interesting imagery, although for some reason Shelly Duval gets a bit more irritating every time I see it. One can just about understand Jack Nicholson wanting to 'correct' her. Still, a good creepy ride.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I loved this space western.  Great cast and you can't beat anything done by Josh Whedon.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B0086DBE62|2.0|Very disappointing take off on the Snow White story, and not worthy of Julia Robert's talents. Painfully slow and boring.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kiddos will drain any battery with this game. They are addicted to it and love the graphics and challenges through out the game.
B000ICXQGK|4.0|Worth watching for the imagery and special effects. Beyond that, how you feel about the story depends  a lot on what your spiritual beliefs are. It offers one possibility for an afterlife and redemption after a tragic set of circumstances breaks a family apart. Some will see the storyline as fanciful but unlikely, others as inspirational. Either way, worth the watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was reccomended by daughter, whom enjoyed it.  If you like to read a book in one day, this is a good one.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Not up to Tim Burton's usual standards, but kept my interest enough to keep watching. I don't recommend you let young kids watch it unless you're willing to explain why Fluffy or Spot can't be bought back to life.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I purchased this film after seeing it on the awards show. I didn't really know what to expect and was so surprised when it was over. A great deal of excellent work went into filming and editing. They didn't seem to give much credit to the lead actor, Suraj Sharma. He sure did a great job. I don't know how they made the animals do the great job that they did without doing damage to the young actor. The story line was enough to keep my attention and the special effects were excellent. It won the director the top award. He is good! I highly suggest this film as a must see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Of the 3 seasons of 'Downton Abbey' offered so far, I think this is the best to date --- rich story, well acted, beautiful settings and costumes and one of the most realistic death scenes ever filmed. 'Downton Abbey' will be re-watched many times in my life.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I read several different professional reviews about this film and they were not that good. I don't know why. It is very well done and the music is as usual, excellent. Everyone in the film was able to carry a tune and since it is a musical, there was very little speaking in the film. Casting was questionable but good enough to make it still very well done. The sound was well done for anyone who has good equipment for your home theater. I really love the film and can understand why there were Oscar nominations. Anne Hathaway sure did deserve the winning nod for her role in the film. SO GOOD. Highly recommend the film. If you have ever heard the music, you will not be disappointed with this.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|Ok...I know the movie is a cult classic. Thats why we love it. Good quality and I love to watch this when I have time to lounge by the TV.<br />Great feature if you dont expect a lot. I really enjoy it and laughed a lot. Great CG affects.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS NEW CD?  Of course the first track is by far my fav, but the cd as a whole is great.
B001APM46W|5.0|I love George Michael every since the days of Wham and he is sensational still.  He sings with that smooth and sexy electrifying vigor that we fans love.  He is just so wonderful and just as sexy and handsome as ever.  I love this CD and play it all the time and it relaxes me and gives me tranquility, spirituality, and peace.  I feel so emotional and so much love when I listen to it.  I recommend that people by this CD and hear what I have.
B0030T1NAO|2.0|Bought through a third party , and the DVD case was broken , DVD was good , and love the show.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Most successful games start off easy and get increasingly difficult as you make progress. I have never understood why racing games tend to follow a trend that is quite the antithesis of the aforementioned philosophy.<br /><br />My experience is that you must compete with an awkward to maneuver &#34;crappy&#34; vehicle until you get good enough with it to earn one that is easier to drive. This business drives me off quite early (no pun intended). I have spoken to others who have the same experience. A friend of mine was unable to complete the game Rage by &#34;id Software&#34; (creators of the Doom and Quake franchise), because it has a large racing element that follows the same pattern of difficulty.<br /><br />Why does it seem logical to some people that a game must get easier as you progress. Bouncing off trees and trying my best to stay out of the ditch (with little success) is not fun to me. If it's hard for me (an avid gamer), it must be very frustrating for little children who have much less gaming experience. This game seems to be intended for the younger crowd. Perhaps I am mistaken.<br /><br />I am glad they offer trial versions of these games. I would be quite angry if I had paid money to be so frustrated straight away (pun intended) by this game. I didn't get far enough into the game to be able to give an honest review of the actual game-play throughout. Perhaps they should have made it more fun (easy) at the beginning.
B000FC0ZEO|4.0|I wouldn't give any of the books in this trilogy less than 4 stars, but if I were to rank them I would put this behind the others.<br /><br />(SPOILER)<br /><br />In the Farseer and the first two of Tawny Man, Hobb showed us each season of Fitzchivalry's life (albeit sometimes indirectly -- ie. Fitz reminiscing on the lone years with Nighteyes). As a result, the neat little bow the latter portion of his life was tied up in at the end of Fool's Fate left me feeling cheated. I would have preferred &#34;and so, this is where we get off...&#34; to &#34;happily ever after&#34; because it seems to trivialize all the unresolved conflict; both externally and within Fitz.<br /><br />I loved the series, loved Hobb. Don't mean to sound unappreciative, just bothered me a little.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|best rss reader I have found for the Fire. we will see if they are still around after July. I sure hope so!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|There are a lot of reasons to rate a movie as &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad,&#34; but to me it all comes down to whether it is entertaining and it is enjoyable. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey exceeded my expectations in both of these categories. If you enjoyed Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, then you will find The Hobbit very similar and equally as enjoyable.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Not sure why Amazon grouped reviews for the re- release with the old release as they're entirely different beasts but that's besides the point. This is an amazing album regardless and one of if not my favorite album/s of all time.<br /><br />  Mad Season was an American rock supergroup formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994 by members of three grunge pioneers: Alice in Chains vocalist Layne Staley, Pearl Jam (and side project Temple of the Dog with Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell which you should also look into) guitarist Mike McCready and Screaming Trees drummer Barret Martin. On bass John Baker Saunders, a blues talent in bands such as Little Pat Rushing, Hubert Sumlin, Sammy Fender, and The Lamont Cranston Band. Mark Lanegan also of Screaming Trees Rounds out the group with guest vocals on I'm Above and Long Gone Day.<br /><br /> This Re-issue is simply amazing, from the forward written by Barret Martin that completely captured the mindset of the 90's and nearly brought a tear to my eye to the photos included in the brief but welcomed booklet you can tell this whole re-issue was made from love for the grunge movement and most importantly with respect to the fans and the artists involved some of whom are no longer with us.<br /><br /> The album itself 'Above' is completely remastered and sounds more amazing than ever. I own the original album and I can tell you personally that it sounds leaps and bounds better that the previous release. Saunder's walking bass lines and McCready's soul filled guitar riffs have never sounded better.<br /><br /> This re-issue also includes an additional music CD of Mad Season's Live at the Moore show. One of the rare few the band ever performed and also one of Layne Staley's last gigs(remastered in superb audio) and a dvd showing said Live at the Moore concert that was previously only available on vhs (and in poor quality at that) remastered, reworked, and remixed into 5.1 dolby digital surround that sounds truly amazing and Stereo(which I personally can't vouch for)<br /><br /> Bonus Features included on the dvd include unseen footage from the Live at the Moore concert of Wake up, Artificial Read, I'm above and a John Lennon cover 'I don't wanna be a soldier' Also inlcuded is the RKCNDY New Year's Eve Convert filmed months before the initial release of 'Above' by hand cam (also remastered in 5.1 digital surround and stereo) as well as a music video for River Of Deceit and two more performances of Lifeless Dead and I Don't Know Anthing for a radio station in complete raw form.<br /><br /> The real surprise here and the main reason for throwing down the money for a re-issue even if you already own the original cd or the Live at the Moore vhs is the RKCNDY New Years Eve show. I was fortunate enough to own a copy of the vhs concert of the At the Moore concert which is as previously stated remastered here completely (audio and visually) but the new years eve show only remastered audio wise and shot with a raw hand cam really shows the talent of the band and makes you feel like you were a part of something amazing that very few have ever seen and unless this re-issue catches on never will ever see.<br /><br /> Mad Season is a testament to what nineties music was all about, exploration of self expression and a true artistic Projection of the soul. If you're a Mad Season fan, an Alice IN Chains fan, a Pearl Jam Fan or a Screaming trees fan you own it to yourself to own this album. The Re-issue makes the deal even sweeter.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie has a great concept. The cast played there parts well, Amandla Stanberg was great!!!!!<br />Chilling a great experience
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is one of Arthur C. Clarke's best novels. It is about our perception of evil and our understanding of what possible extraterrestrial contact could look like. The surprise ending is about our possible long term evolution from our current childhood to our ultimate form  of being. It is absolutely one of the best science fiction novels of all time by an exquisite king of the science fiction genre.
B000002J5K|5.0|had to order the cd since the new car has that type of music system. Love the Blues Brothers! great cruising music!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game if Thrones is a wonderful, complex show with well developed characters. I would highly recommend this series. If you are squeamish to blood and gore or sexual situations, don't purchase this.
B000002KYR|5.0|Had to order since my new car has a cd player - no more tapes. always loved the bearded boys from texas
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Offers hope to those struggling with the expression of their creativity.  You / we are not alone and there is hope!

B008602KQI|5.0|All in all a great movie - they changed quite a bit from the books but I still enjoyed it.  Shame about the casting choices for Peta and Gail.
0465011047|5.0|I started reading this book and couldn't put it down. I am amazed at the endurance and hope this young man had during this dismal time. Also, I admire his bravery for trying the escape knowing what it could lead to if caught.
B008B68IEA|5.0|me gustan mucho estos juguetes si no fueran para mi niña, yo los coleccionaría claro que unas me gustan mas que otros y por cierto unos son mas costosos que otros en este caso esta bien solo una duda no hay alguna otra opción para que el envió sea mas barato claro que con la misma calidad del envoltorio aunque tardara mas tiempo en llegar.<br />es que el envió si es un poco mas caro
0452289963|4.0|Of interest and well worth a read. Especially if you are spiritually inclined. I find the book not especially exciting, however it has lots to impart and the reader will decide for his or her self.

1451695195|4.0|Yes I llike this book. I realize that science does not  want to admit to an afterlife, however, this book will take the interest of some in the medical profession. The best thing is that it was written by a neurosurgeon and it is about time that medicine and spiritual matters come together.
B0064QNS62|5.0|Thus game is really fun I just love it its a really good game to plat you should give it a try !!
B00000F214|5.0|Blu ray and audio is very good. I watched in 5.1 surround sound 1080P and it was like I never seen the movie before.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|i like this game, not sure i understand exactly what i'm doing or the goal.  But, i like trying to get as many items in a row as possible.  its something you do while waiting in doctors office, etc.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|I loved re-watching it! I gave it away to my old teenage friends to watch.<br />We all got a kick out reliving the memories of that time in our lives!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|pay in my kindle and enjoy very much. its long enough to enjoy and get involved in. i like the symbols used.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|What an incredible waste of time. The only thing worse would have been if I spent money to see it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I had originally gave this game 5 stars but I am getting so stinking pissed off on how I keep accidentally wasting all my gold because it doesn't ask if you are sure you want to purchase something it just purchases it!!! -_- one touch and bam there went my gold. so frustrating. I'm begging you to put that &quot;are you sure you want to purchase&quot; option because I could have had my 2nd nest by now if it wasn't for these stupid accidents wasting my gold. other than that its still the best game out of them all.
B004ZJZPWA|3.0|Ok movie.  Just ok.  I was expecting more from a Hugh Jackman movie.  I may need to watch again to see if I am correct on my opinion.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this app is great and I enjoy it so them much (Love it)<br />(*-*) &lt;3 who ever is reading this get it because is hello funn to play it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Writer Andy Weir gets a person stranded on Mars and allows the reader to venture with him through the harrowing saga. Easy read.  Smart and creative sci-fi.  You will find yourself cheering with excitement, feeling the triumphs and disappointments.  I loved every minute of it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It was a revealing look into the relationships between slaves and owners and the community during the period.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is all you need!  Price is right too.  It an advanced calculator and I think it was free, or very inexpensive.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|I've been waiting for this album.  Ever since Brand New Eyes, I was really hoping the band would come out of the crash-and-burn, and I think they have with this album.  It's not as great as Riot!, but it has catchy songs, like &#34;Still Into You&#34;.  I wish Hayley would stop the lyrics about her public pressure (though I imagine she's been under a lot of it), and just concentrate on more happy thoughts and catchy vocals.  I listened to Riot! again, and realized what really made that sound successful were the guitar riffs and fast drum beats, mixed with Hayley's clear voice.  That potent combination gave their sound a very young energetic vibe.  Josh Farro is just a genius with the guitar.<br /><br />What's with the ukulele in some of the songs on this album?  I don't want to think I'm in Hawaii.. I want some awesome guitar riffs!<br /><br />Finally, what's with the MP3 album costing more than buying the album and downloading the songs instantaneously via Amazon Cloud Player, since this album is supported on AutoRip?
B004U52VPS|5.0|THe product arrived in the expected time, my niece loves it!<br /><br />I don't know if she will get bored soon, taking into account that it has few items...
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This was a beautiful story about two teenagers who connect and love one another. It took me back to my own first love and what it is to get completely lost in another person.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|works super badass. really fast. and it has a bright ass light. recommend this to everyone. I don't leave the house without it.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Mechanics are very simple. Roll for brains and try to avoid shotguns. You can search YouTube for how-to-play videos if you find the minimal instructions confusing. This game is perfect for a quick party game. 13 dice come in a cardboard dice cup. Not sure how durable the dice cup will be. Dice are of good quality.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|It has limited layouts but I was looking for some thing to work my mind which this does just fine.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I don't recall this movie when it came out.  I heard the song, Gabriel's Oboe and loved it, so was curious about the movie.  It's not a feel good movie, but DeNiro does a great job, as do all of the other actors.  Even as old as it is, the historical content is good and research proves that the Jesuit priests and the missions were used by the Church and then not protected as they should have been.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|Takes some getting used to, but gets to be engrossing after a bit of reading. Esp. rewarding to those who sail to oceans.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show sometimes scares the stuffin' out of me!  ...but in a good way, lol!  XD  I recommend it highly.

B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show and all the characters!  I recommend it highly, and I hope it stays on the air forever!  Lol!  :D
034554398X|4.0|George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire has captivated millions everywhere. Lovers of the book series and HBO show alike (including myself) have enjoyed the story up to this point. But, in my opinion, this is really the do-or-die of the book series. If you can finish this novel, you will be hooked until the end.<br /><br />The story in this volume picks up right where [[ASIN:0345535421 A Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two]] left off, with all of our favorite and not-so-favorite characters in the midst of the Westeros Civil War. With so many loose ends left at the end of the previous entry, readers will be eager to jump right back in and continue the story.<br /><br />And I think that that is the problem with this book: the story doesn't always continue. Long sections of this book chronicle characters boring treks through the woods, without too much suspense or even character development (with the exception of a few notable chapters here or there). While I'm already invested in these characters and the possible consequences their actions have on the rest of Westeros... the plot is simply uninteresting if the only thing that these characters are doing is walking around and talking about stuff and falling into danger that should feel real but doesn't. The biggest offenders of this are the Arya Chapters, which the show seems to have remedied that plotline already. But Daenarys and Brienne have their fair share of long, boring walks.<br /><br />In addition to the forest strolls, there is a lot of political filler in here, too. Conversations that would have been intriguing and suspenseful in the first or second novels are now long and stretched out. And again, the threats feel empty and often just appear to be hashing out problems in attempts to resolve them. For the first 400+ pages of this novel, all chapters concerning the Red Keep are literally about planning a Wedding.<br /><br />I don't know if all of the above was meant to be filler. In truth, it may have been that George R. R. Martin meant it as legitimate plot development and character study, but at this point in the series, we are 1500+ pages, two books, and two TV seasons into the story. Which means, all of the patterns and formulas Martin has used are starting to become more apparent. Characters move in circles, being put on paths to meet certain other characters who we wouldn't initially have thought they would be meeting. Then, these two cahracters meet and something happens, putting one of the characters on another path to see someone else. These multiple-path stories stop being plotlines... they start becoming episodes from morning cartoons, short, repetitive plays that everyone can predict. And this is where the boredom comes from.<br /><br />Once you hit about page 500 or so, however, the book really picks up. the sense of danger becomes *real* again, and the book basically reads itself. If you can last that long, it will have you all excited for the next book in the series, [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]], which I'm currently working my way through. As of writing this, I think I should also note that, so far, the TV series this season is handling the boring parts of the book much better than Martin did.filler.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|Great story. It sucked me in from page 1 and I wasn't able to put it down. Really good suspense and great characters.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|This cover is far too big for the kindle i purchased it for. It is more than an inch too big in the clips and does me no good.
B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoyed this game, but it freezes up and lags which interferes with smooth gameplay. Besides that, this is a fantastic game and suggest it.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Great movie & still scary. Good quality & price . Always buy with amozons. Always happy. Thanx amonzons u have done it again

B005HJU7HA|5.0|I love all the stories. they keep me reading, I cant put the book down. I highly recommend it to all.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Never had a chance to play the game because of the over 500MB of downloads this thing wanted me to do before I was even able to play.  No thank you. Uninstalled!
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turns throughout the book, love that it kept you thinking and was not predictable. Read it soon!

B00BDSRKHO|4.0|When nearly 25 years pass between albums with the original members of OMD, there's bound to be some bumps along the road.  \\"History of Modern\\" was an OK album, but it sounded like the Andy, Paul and co. were struggling to recapture the magic that made those early OMD albums so exceptional.  Sure, it had some high points, but it was largely a lackluster affair.  It wasn't altogether unexpected given the long hiatus.<br /><br />Gladly, \\"English Electic\\" rights most of those missteps.  With \\"EE,\\" OMD sounds more OMD than they have since \\"Sugar Tax.\\"  It's a nice mix between the faux-chorals and minimalist synths of \\"Architecture and Morality\\" and the experimental knob-twiddling of \\"Dazzle Ships.\\"  \\"EE\\" is sprinkled with some classic sounding OMD - \\"Night Cafe,\\" \\"Stay with Me\\" (echos of \\"Dreaming\\"), \\"Dresden\\" (echos of \\"Electricity\\") and \\"Helen of Troy\\" (echos of \\"Joan of Arc\\" and \\"Maid of Orleans\\") are surefire singles with catchy choruses and pristine production.  They're light and effortless, but not disposable by any stretch.  \\"EE\\" isn't so much a reinvention, but rather a reinforcement of all the things that have made OMD so great the last 30 years.<br /><br />If there's a knock on the album, it's the lyrics.  We're talking some pretty pedestrian stuff.  They seem to work reasonably well with the lighthearted pop songs, but on their own, they're groaners..  It's all perfectly forgivable, though, since there are few bands out there capable of producing immaculate pop songs on par with OMD.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Depeche, Erasure and OMD were my holy trinity.  With Depeche dropping one of the best albums of their career last month and OMD releasing a very enjoyable album this month, the pressure's on Vince and Andy to bring their A game next time around.  I hope they accept the challenge!
B003CI90MQ|4.0|The technical information wa well written. However the author is not ad funny a he thinks he is. Worth the price I paid.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is wonderful! It makes you laugh and cry.  It is well worth the hour or two it takes to get through it!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This movie is amazing. It's starts out a little silly, but get's much much better. The ending is great. It shows real character development and the world it is set in is amazing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|game is fun. great during bad weather when you cant be out riding. make sure to read the starting guide after you've downloaded. a little hard to figure out without the guide
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Amazing book, could read it over and over.<br />Worth reading if you haven't read it yet! One of my all-time favorites
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love reading the bible for 5 minutes most days.  Only problem is you will need to be connected to wi fi to read.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|AMAZING CHARACTERS, SCENERY, HOBBIT HOUSES (we adore them)...TOTALLY DELIGHTFUL, and realistic, story was very entertaining, completely professional, by all the actors and director.
B00BESM14U|1.0|Unfortunately their was so many stops in the download I was unable to see it. This is the second time I have had major stoppages while trying to view an amazon film. I was disappointed. Is it possible to get a refund?<br />Carol Bush
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Fablous Actors, scenery, suspense, and heartfelt drama. You become a part of the situation, and breathless during the water events.<br />Loved it!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|The first book was amazing.  This book was still enjoyable because I'm into the characters now, but I found like I was waiting for action during the extended boring scenes where nothing was happening.  The part with the sex chick was cool at first but grew old quick, as did the training at the school and his time with the king or duke or whatever.  Hopefully the next installment will recapture some of the energy of the first one.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Entertaining, educational, completely intriging..Excellent actors, as well as some of the 'guests' like Michael J Fox episodes, this was brilliant.<br />Not being a fan of court room drama - this has changed my opinion, because they are so clever and 'compasionate' when appropiate.<br />Love the Series and all the Actors..<br />Thanks!
0756405890|5.0|One of the best sci-fi reads in a long time.  Lots of action, adventure and great characters.  Its too bad the sequel was such a turd in comparison.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I read this book in one day. I'm not gonna lie I was not sure what to expect but I was blown away at the way she describes everything around her. I cried on more than one occasion. By far my favorite book of the year. Amazing
B003HC8I5M|5.0|such a pity he's unable to play drums because of back problems<br />old age sucks i agree.<br />phil, hard to believe your talent it's just endless.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Completed this book over 2.5 days. I did not want to put it down nor did I want it to end. Thank you Mr Follett, now may I have part III.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this down. From the very first pages I was hooked with the characters. I can't wait to read what happens next.
B00A83075M|5.0|really great movie for adults and kids! It was one of the kids movies i may have enjoyed more than the kids
B00BF11STU|3.0|I rated it 3 stars because of the topic, excitement, suspense and flow.  It was fast moving and riveting but also confusing in spots, difficult to hear, and too light on character development.  I also would have liked them to include the President watching the operation with Hillary Clinton.  That was powerful!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the easiest calculator to use. I would recommend this to anyone!! Great. Anyone can use this without having trouble.
B00846REIS|5.0|They have a great story and it is hard to put the book down. This book is like the 50 Shades series so if you loved those then you'll love the Crossfire novel series. Can't get enough, read the second one too, now I'm just waiting for the third to be released.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love Tennant's cool and unassuming Doctor and the level of humor he injects in the role. Looks like a good time to start running.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love their story and cannot wait for the next book to be released. I think this is a great read, especially if you enjoyed the 50 Shades of Grey series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This whole series is &#34;cult&#34;ivating! I have read all 5 books and seen all the HBO episodes. Fabulous. Read them and you'll want more. I read that Martin is writing two more!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!! Great read! Read the whole series. They have a great story and I love seeing where their relationship takes them. &#60;3
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I actually own this - it's that good! I think I started breathing in the last 5 minutes of this movie....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So easy to read and get into, you won't want to put it down for a minute. I'm always keeping an eye out for books my husband will like and this is one for sure. This is a great book for readers that love action and don't want to feel bored when reading. I can't wait to read the second book!
B0041O40EI|2.0|Apparently, this didn't come with instructions, so even with the help of his father, the boy couldn't figure out how to put it together. Bummer!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|They have a great story and I love seeing where it takes them. Best sereies ever! I don't want to stop reading for a second.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I heard some pretty good reviews of this movie so I rented it.  As soon as it was over my husband said &#34;Glad we did not pay to go to the theater to see that&#34;.  Again women are just there for James Bond to relax with.
B006PRCGKO|5.0|Great movie, cannot believe i have never seen it before, would recommend to any fan of science fiction, an oldie but a goldie
B005J2UM9S|1.0|This started off very spooky, nice build up and creepy scenes, but then the writer seemed to run out of ideas and just decided to kill off the cast in the most incomprehensible ways.  Nothing was explained why all of a sudden THIS particular group of people were killed off when the beginning of the show was filled with interviews of other people who had been in the asylum at night.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|my daughter absolutely loves this game, and it really makes you have to think critically and problem solve if you want to go to the later levels
B00003CWLF|3.0|Loved this flick, got it for a girls' dorm and it's checked out all the time. Movie nights galore with this one.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|It just wasn't 'savage' enough.  Ever read the news for what really happens in Mexico these days?  A movie called 'Savages' that involves the Mexican cartels needs to be at least as savage as reality.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|We watch this all the time.  Great story, very close to the book version and even a little cleaner than the book.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|I love Emmy Rossum on &#34;Shameless&#34; and her choice of her mother's songs on this album are well chosen for us children of the 40's, 50's.  She's a great actress and now a songstress.  I recommended it to my older brother and he was very pleased.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I used it a couple times when I couldn't find my phone. Great for Kindle, but not really a must-have.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Lot's of gore but a good story line. Perhaps not as good as season 1 and 2 but explores different issues.
0425098478|5.0|Great lessons, quick read, concise principles. Easy to implement and great results. It's a winner for everyone when you implement these lessons.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Still contains so much to think about that is or should be relevant today! Some descriptions and conditions Clarke describes are quaint and do not hold up so well for today, but perhaps serve nicely as glimpses into the time of writing. Like all great science fiction, there is ethical dilemma here that is still worthy or perhaps is even more worthy of our individual and collective consideration. Loved the book if only for this kick in the pants.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|don't know what all the hype is about this game. fun enough, great time waster, but not really amazing as I thought.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|kid likes watching it and i can play it on blu RAY OR REGULAR DVD...FOR THOSE THAT DONT HAVE A BLU RAY IN EVERY ROOM

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great large keys for any size of fingers. also great for those with sight problems. I like the memory features, very easy to use.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|What a great book. Not overly deep, but very well written, suspensful, and satisfying. It had me hooked from beginning to end. Highly recommended for a fun, yet higher-brow fast-paced read.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|I really like the feedly app. I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars just because it is quite slow to load on my Android phone initially. I am not sure, though, if that might be an internet connection problem, so I figure 5 stars is probably the more fair way to round it. :)<br /><br />Once the app gets going, it is super fast because it loads up your posts as what it calls &#34;cards&#34; -- simplified versions just for mobile, designed with quick loading in mind. It sure beats waiting for the full pages to load on my laptop! With the feedly app, I can read through my blog feed very quickly and bookmark the ones I would like to come back to later for commenting or whatever. (Not that you could not visit the webpage directly from the app, too. I just prefer to comment from my computer most of the time.)<br /><br />The app is simple, attractive, and very logically organized. It took very little getting used to for me.<br /><br />I also like the widget. It shows a short list of titles and pictures from several recent posts from your feed, which you can flip through with a single tap. When you find one you would like to read, another tap will load the app.<br /><br />One other complaint I had is that when I first got started with feedly, it was signing me out every time I left the app (it was the same online); more recently, it has been keeping me signed in, though, so I am honestly not sure what the deal was with that; just thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />All in all, I love it. I am very happy to have learned about feedly.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.  I play it every night and even had to go to a Bingo Parlor to play the actual game.  This is great!! I don't pay to play though, I just play the regular games.  I haven't gotten to the point to unlock anything yet either.  Play just a short time or I would not sleep lol.

1616550414|5.0|I think this is a good book for the fans of the series. I didn't get the opportunity to go through it comprehensively to do a full review because I bought it for my brother, but he tells me it is an excellent product.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Too much like Glee -- but if you're a fan of the show, then you'd love it. We caught ourselves quoting it a couple times, but we wouldn't watch it again.
B0082A3JHQ|4.0|Great live album, some of the best live Hendrix!  You wonder if Hendrix was still alive how different music would be, as he was still evolving and creating new music until his untimely and too early death.

B00112ASYO|5.0|I purchased this item at a local Atwoods for about $6.50.  Mine isn't nearly as green as the Amazon picture and is instead a more lifelike mixture of grey, green, and brown.  Even the underside of the animal is realistically painted and the eyes are a haunting reptilian yellow with slitted black pupils.  Very cool!<br /><br />Schleich is always spot-on with their animal figures and this guy (gal?) is no different.  Although they often make their toys anatomically-correct, there's not much to see on a crocodile so this item could be male or female.<br /><br />The crocodile has webbed feet and surprisingly realistic scales and spines down it's back.  You can really see how this is an ancient creature that has lived on this planet for thousands and thousands of years.<br /><br />Definitely a good purchase for play or display!

B001BPQT8A|5.0|Many have already provided plot summaries and opinions on the acting, storyline etc so I won't go there.  My reviews focus only on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I do have this film on Standard Def DVD but it is not a side by side comparison.  The Blu Ray I purchased does not have a book; it is a single disc blu ray.<br /><br />The transfer to blu ray is about as good as it gets with a very clean transfer containing no artifacts, noticeable grain or dirt.  At no point did I see any aliasing or stair stepping either.  The colors, despite some obvious but deliberate bleach bypassing during post production, are true to life and not too deeply saturated as often films are.  There are many dark and shadowy  scenes in this film but details are not lost at all.  This is one film that was truly remastered during the process of updating it to blu ray.<br /><br />The audio is equally excellent with a new DTS MA 7.1 lossless audio.  The difference between the lossless and lossy audio is significant if you have a decent home theater system.  While my system is currently a 5.1 system, the use of the discreet channels for both the front and rear stages is just plain sweet.  The soundtrack/score envelopes you throughout the film and the foley fx are not just steered towards the front stage, the rear's are also used a great deal with the sub LFE channel doing its job contributing.  This has got to be one of the most worked over audio transfers on any Blu Ray disc, really fine.<br /><br />The menu for 'Seven' is the only thing that really was poor.  The contrast between what you have selected or not is barely susceptible to the eyes and I had a very difficult time navigating through the many extras.  These extras consisted of several alternate and deleted scenes, an excellent documentary on how mastering the transfer was done including the audio and color correction, commentaries, the credits, which blew me away when I first saw this film in the theaters, and so much more.  There were plenty of alternate languages to choose from if English is not your first language and subtitles are there also.<br /><br />Not sure why the menu choice contrast is so poor but the blu ray of Seven is a must have for any collector and well worth upgrading to if you have it on Standard Def.<br /><br />All my reviews focus only upon the quality of the transfer to blu ray .  Hope this review has been of help to you in deciding upon your purchase.<br />Thanks for reading.There were plenty of alternate languages to choose from if English is not your first language and subtitles are there also.<br /><br />Not sure why the menu choice contrast is so poor but the blu ray of Seven is a must have for any collector and well worth upgrading to if you have it on Standard Def.<br /><br />All my reviews focus only upon the quality of the transfer to blu ray .

B007EECSFA|5.0|This book captivated my attention from the very first chapter. I could not put it down.  I love books with an historical background and this one did not disappoint.  It was my introduction to Kate Morton and for the first time in my life, I wrote to the author to tell her how much I loved the book.  The most interesting portion of the book is that just when the reader thinks the story is over, it is not!  And, the ending is an &#34;open mouth&#34; surprise.  Loved the characters, the setting, and the pace of the story.  Need more :)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Myself and my family used swype for a couple years before finding this app.  Swiftkey is the best input app we have ever used to date.  And I have tried several over the years.  Auto correct is great and it does an awesome job of registering what I input.  I also like the keyboard layout the best.

B00BI73CVI|5.0|I waited a long time to see this movie because I'm not a big fan of musicals and I didn't think I'd enjoy all the singing.  I was wrong!  This turned out to be one of my favorite all-time movies.  I loved the acting, the scenery and the story.  The music only added to the overall impression.  There were a few scenes in the second half that dragged a little for me but that didn't take away from how much I enjoyed it!

B0041VXGRS|5.0|I love desert I love chocolate, cakes, puddings, ice cream cakes, pies and cookies.  I am always opened to try anything sweet.  So when I tried my first cake pop I fell in love.  I was determined to make these delectable treats.  Then I received this book from Bookbub.com.  I devoured it it takes some practice but I know that I will master these cake pops.  I love the simplicity of this book the pictures, and instructions are fantastic.  I finally was able to make some cake pops for work to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  All I can say they were a hit.  My co-workers thought I bought them I took that as a complement.  I recommend that you pick up a copy of this book and see for yourself how easy but yet so pretty this desert can be.  
B00BF11STU|1.0|Like the &#34; Hurt Locker &#34; Ms. Bigelow is out of touch again !  The movie focused primarily on the CIA analyst who after her many long hours of dedication remains at the same pay grade ?  The movie should have focused more on ST6 training on the mock up and ST6 members don't wear polo shirts with their collars up ? About Jennifer Matthews character the book &#34; Triple Agent &#34; by Jody Warrick her first overseas posting was in Afghanistan so why does Ms. Bigelow have her in Pakistan ? In order to move up a higher pay grade at the CIA Ms. Matthews had to take a assignment in a hostile area and that was at Camp Chapman in Khost , Afghanistan. Ms. Matthews also was one of the few CIA personal who had knowledge regarding the 9/11 Hijackers entering the USA so she took the bait hook line and sinker 3 months into her new assignment. I think Ms. Bigelow should have done more fact checking and come back to reality.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|What could be more boring that a movie about a king with a speech impediment?  Wrong!  It was fascinating and had me on the edge of my chair.  Outstanding acting on all accounts.
B009JBZH54|4.0|very well done movie trilogy.  Keeps you gripped from the first movie to the last.  Wish another movie would be made.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was entertaining, and easy to read.  I believe it will be better to read the book before watching the movie.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|I admire both Lincoln and Spielberg.  But this, however, is Speilberg's worst film.  Lincoln is portrayed as someone primarily with a petty and resentful mind who is so ashamed of himself he stoops a lot of the time.  Take a look at most of the pictures of Lincoln even his stoop has dignity not shown in this film.  His true grandeur is seen only in his speeches. And the only really admirable character in this film Stevens, is pictured as having primarily personal motives.  Neither man's greatness is honestly shown.  It's true that it is hard to show Lincoln with both his greatness and his warts, but this film does him a great disservice.  I am sorry to say that the film seems to come from that in all of us that competes with and hates the greatness of other people.

B0086700CM|5.0|If there was a oz great and powerful temple run app for a kindle fire for free that would be awesome I would buy it on all devices
B00454U1NS|2.0|CD was broken when I received it, not the shipper's fault, post office apparently was very rough with it.  I was reimbursed the full amount!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book ,all the books were good. I suggest whatever woman want to read a good it's these books!!!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A great true story. It got somewhat repetitious. The side lights made you feel like you knew the 'seals' and were there.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The continuation from Bare to you kept me curious and I needed to now why and how.  Though Gideon was a billionaire he still was a man with a loving heart.  Men should read about Gideon in how to make a women feel mentally  and sexually and you have to love Eva, she is strong,  can't wait to read the next book about their continued journey
B004QPOVE6|5.0|We had seen this concert live in Seattle and just loved it.  Bought the Blu-ray and was just as happy.  This is an awesome concert and definitely worth seeing not to mention great music and lots of fun.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|This is the best read I have had in decades, actually right up there with the entrancement I had with Narnia; engulfing every book and re-reading bits just for the sheer enjoyment of them.  This is superbly authored with complexity and unrivalled imagery, and a bit raunchy, and just about everything else you could want in a fantasy realm that I believe has no real comparison.  I am astounded at the majesty of the world inhabited by these characters with thousands of years of background, it is a world like no other and I fully understand now how such a fantastic television series has come about - from these texts.
B00280LYHS|5.0|just cant stop reading. this book is the reason that i will continue purchase Riordan's work.<br />there are so many impressions that i cant explain. you just have to enjoy it yourself
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very inspirational. It is a must read. For everyone. All ages. One of the best books I have ever read.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|exellent book and idea. went on this diet and lost 6 pounds already.watch for series on PBS TV. Maybe this is finally the answer
B00BF11STU|3.0|I was hoping to gain some new insight based on information from the people who did it, but it is just an acted out version of what was in the news perhaps even less.
0307596885|5.0|Since Alice Munro is my favorite author, I really loved her latest collection of short stories. She is a master at creating stories around life's human experiences of hopes, dreams, disappointments, regret, and tragedy. She writes through the eyes and ears of each of her characters with clarity and vision. Her stories all take place in small Canadian towns, but they paint a picture of how connected we all are to how extraordinary and ordinary life really is.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I purchased this based on reviews by other purchasers. I'm glad I did. I paired it with a Jawbone Jambox. It was so easy to set up and use and the sound is phenonminal. You can't go wrong.
B00170MYIS|4.0|I can't count how many of these I have purchased before I got one that worked. I now can use the digital camera that has been collecting dust.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Highly recommended, suspenseful, exciting.. great story, we need more movies like this one Special effects and cinematography above reproach Thank you..
044654759X|5.0|Very good book.  I enjoyed it very much, yet I cannot understand why her friend Jo did not warn her that what's-his-name was in town.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|First thing I check when I use my fire HD.  Simple to calibrate, it provides quick accurate estimates on how much time available for different activities; most helpful on the go,  liked the product with my 1st gen fire and glad I upgraded to pro for my fire HD.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Loved it! My only complaint is that I kept pausing the game on accident. Just frustrating, synthesize button was located somewhere else. But that's not really big deal for me.
B0089T334E|3.0|There are two albums with the same name but completely different tracks. They share the same rating and reviews, which are not for the album with the purple cover with a tree silhouette.<br /><br />This one with the purple cover with a tree silhouette has an abrupt start on the first track and a pop at the end of the last track indicating poor mastering.<br /><br />I didn't find any way to give this feedback to Amazon.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Way better than the first version.  Has more to offer, such as more levels and better graphics.  Played on the kindle free version.
B005I4JG80|2.0|While Druckerman is not wrong about French parenting, I found it unbelievably audacious for her to write a book about a culture that she barely knew at the time. Living in Paris, with a circle of anglophone friends, affords little experience about real French life. Druckerman also makes the fatal error of assuming that \\"Parisian\\" means French, when the rest of the country knows otherwise. The only real assertion she makes about those living outside of Paris, before dismising them entirely, is that they are fatter.<br /><br />That said, many of her theories hold true, although I think most French would find it laughable that she found them to be enough of a \\"parenting style\\" on which to base a book. The idea of \\"The Pause\\" is common sense at its basest and not a parenting technique that the French all agree to practice. What I found the most hilarious was the idea of \\"national meal time.\\" This is not a mystical, agreed-upon schedule, but well, MEAL TIMES as dicated by the concept of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If there is a \\"national\\" snack time, it is because this is when the children finish school for the day, period. If the French school hours change, guess what? So will snack time.<br /><br />It's am interesting book for an American audience, but for anyone with any real experience with the French, it is riddled with stereotypes and exaggerations.  She claims to have \\"never\\" seen children misbehaving during a meal. I can tell you that I read the book while sitting in a cafe in a French shopping center. One child was rolling on the floor in front of me, and another was dragged by his arm (literally) when it was time to leave. Does this then mean that French children are naughty, because I saw it once? Of course not. It is true that French children often tend to sit for long periods in restaurants with more patience than their American counterparts, but \\"never\\" and \\"always\\" should be employed sparingly.<br /><br />I will say I enjoyed the narratives that were more personal, like those on her experiences having twins. These were authentic and clever.e personal, like those on her experiences having twins. These were authentic and clever.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It does not have as much to offer as the second version.  Still fun for being a free kindle game.
0743270754|5.0|It was exactly what we needed and at the right price.  These rivals loved the United States above all things.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|FANTASTIC movie. Danzel as always outdid himself, he's very beleivable as a drunk but at the same time as a good human being.  Loved it!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I really wanted to like this after hearing good things. But it started off sort of oddly. It was as ifmit went right into teaching mode  like you were in history class. My husband is the big history buff and even he nodded off for a bit. I was torn between 2 or  3 stars but since the acting was good I went with 3.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When the first book came out , I looked at the reviews and saw it was well received but for some reason I passed on buying it. I think it was the title. Boy did I make a mistake. After seeing that the there was an edition consisting of 5 volumes I decided to buy. This book is not only a good read but it kind of makes you wonder if something like what's described could ever happen. Probably not but still........ You can't help but cheer on the spirit and fortitude of the people that try to advance humanity from the grips of confinement and despair. Read the book and then read the following series in the Silo Saga,&#34; Shift&#34;
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Thumbs up!.. This series has kept our family captivated with every episode a fresh puzzle to be solved.  Fun to watch.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Didn't do anything that I expected. I wanted to view a YouTube video - not sure what this application is for, but not what I intended
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love Mitch Albom's work. He is insightful and makes the reader think about what is really important in life. And, although one of the main characters was in a different age, the struggle that we all face with time...not enough time, too much time, is universal. Plus, I found myself routing for the present day characters to figure out for themselves their own meaning of life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show.  Gross for sure and you never know who's getting it next.  Unlike the orginal Star Trek away teams ;-)  not sutible younger kids.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. The story line is heart wrenching and happy all at once. Perfect is all I can say
0802473156|5.0|I do quite a bit of pre-marriage counseling and use this book in the process.  Couples find it very helpful.  Books arrived in timely fashion.  No worries or complaints.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is an excellent game...The graphics are outstanding..the game is both  challenging and fun.  great game looking forward to next edition.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although it is not as good as The Hunger Games, it is a quite decent sequel with a surprising ending
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Easy to download. Excellent price and picture quality.  Plan to order more episodes in the future. Like have my own personal movie theater....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good show I enjoy every episode it keeps you on the edge on every minute. I will love to see season 4 on Amazon
B002X3V4P2|5.0|The best of the best.  I love her music.  She is a truly amazing singer.  Excellent sound and quality. Definitely an A+ product.
B007CI81IQ|5.0|Detailed, in depth research into the causes of global poverty and why past aid efforts have largely failed. The contrast between strongly held positions is noted. Then on the ground studies detail how and why the poor make decisions. Surprising, insightful and an important addition to the many books on development.
0865478007|3.0|I totally believe what he's laid out. So, he is preaching to the choir. What's difficult is how many examples he uses for each point.His anger is strong and comes through the writing.  I have some background in statistics that made it easier for me to understand and appreciate his concepts, but I needed a break. I expect to pick it up, read some more and then take a break. Over and over until I ca finish it.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie, good acting from new upcoming actors and actresses. I am glad that kept the movie as close to what really happened rather than put a Hollywood twist on it.
B00007LTIL|5.0|Oops. It's no longer an album I used to own, it's a CD and a remix and all that new fangled stuff. They think more is better, but I would have been happy with the original stuff as it was. Why does everyone think they can improve everything?
B0018AT7DW|5.0|Love this album and all the songs that I love on it I already know.  Great album with a ton of great songs.
B00513DGIO|5.0|First comprehensive historical analysis of the global problem facing us all.  Excellent read never a dull moment for such an important topic.
B008RYN44U|3.0|I was super excited but I feel like it lacks the great hits that Im used to seeing from her.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Extremely pleased with the game. Great story and game play. However, I think only fans of anime / manga will appreciate this game.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I got a CD with this download, my husband disliked it so much that he thru it out the window while we were driving.
B0085YF1E8|5.0|A perfect blend of life's highs (weddings), lows (funerals) and everything in between including great British humor with a stellar cast!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Intrigue, sex, power, drama...it has it all. And I love the power that the women have in the series. I am always excited to see the next episode.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It just goes to show that in order to make a really good TV series, you don't need a lot of sex,  women showing off their goodies or blood and guts (Not that I would never complain about such things), you just need a well written and interesting script and good actors and you've got yourself a hit. This series is nothing more than  the daily and mostly trivial dealings of an aristocratic family and their live in servants but I was completely mesmerized and at the edge of my seat each and every episode. I warn you, if you watch two or three episodes, you will be hooked and you won't be able to get the theme song out of your head!!!!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|The Jack Reacher novels are terrific. That said, this is not one of the best ones. My recommendation: start with the first of the series and read them all!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Like it very much. As always the book is packed with many documented details and actions. Jack Reacher is as rough as the lands he traveled by.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I found it very interesting and easy to relate to. Couldn't stop watching it. I've liked Juliana Marguiles from her ER days....good to see she's still got it!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Not exactly true to the books, but just as good all the same! Acting is wonderful, special effects are wonderful, cast is perfect! I will watch it again and again.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|This is the best Skynyrd album in 15 years.....they nailed this one!<br />There is not a bad song on the CD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it...about to start reading Mockingjay. The story kept me on the edge of my seat.  I would suggest these books to anyone interested in a good read.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughn is my all time favorite blues rock guy. Albert KIng is an amazing classic Blues man who mixes with Stevie to blow your brains out!!!!!  If you like the blues, this is IT!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I used to love this ap,  It showed me the weather for the week quickly, with smart, easy to understand  icons.  Now it does not give me the weeks weather, and the set up is annoying.  Time to shop for a new weather ap!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Both of these icons will give you chulls when they perform Together Nuddy and The Stones will stop your heart! GREATB DVD!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Got it for my boyfriend for Christmas. Gave my mom the willies, but my boyfriend was thrilled. Thank goodness it will be in the man cave and not in the livingroom. Pretty realistic head.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child has developed a very interesting character with Jack Reacher.  You can hardly wait to see where he goes next, what he does next and how his mind works toward solving the mystery.  I have definitely hooked.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|It was a come on trial version that tried to get you hooked and then pay a bunch more to get the real version.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|this movie was great, this is the only time I was for the bad guy, ce in great shape and very fast ship, thanks and I will order from again
B009WO7NQO|5.0|What can I say, it's Angry Birds...the addictive game with the extra of sound and weapons from Star Wars....Love it.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|great movie set contains both theatear and dierctors cuts of all four movies was extra disc with making of feturretts and each dics has a &#34;MUTHER MODE&#34; loved it a must for fans
B00ATPVA78|3.0|It was another come on at a discount and then when are hooked and enjoying it....you have to pay more to get the real game.....THe game is okay...the deal was not.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|takes place before ailen we find out who the &#34;space jockys&#34; are and what they look like under their helment great movie for alien and sci fi fans
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|You would be hard pressed to find any song on this collection that doesn't please the ears. Each song weaves a landscape from familiar sounds of the past with a modern thread of brilliant music craftsmanship that has been absent from music for a very long time.<br /><br />I really enjoy that the songs flip back and forth from calmer to more upbeat bringing a greater feel of variety amongst the collection. It is noted that this guy is only 19 years old which brings even more of a marvel to the songwriting and intensity behind the emotions with each song.<br /><br />My personal highlights on the cd are Two Fingers, Simple as This, Country Song and Note To Self. I honestly give every single song a 5 star rating...aside from Ballad Of Mr Jones which I'd give a 3. There are other songs I found on You Tube which I'm disappointed didn't make it to cd release as of yet. \\"It's True\\", \\"Something's Wrong\\" and \\"Saffron\\".<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I've been THIS enthusiastic over a new artist. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes good songwriting with good lyrics and infectious melodies.
B00AIBZJLG|2.0|Cirque should stick to  entertaining, give it up on movie making.l<br />adding nine more words as required three to go
B009FZFONO|5.0|The first two seasons are great. However I will say that the third season is starting to remind me of lost.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Blandly written novel = screenwriter's dream? Surprisingly effective dystopian drama; JLaw translates a lot of the numbed resentment that was there in the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is good for all zombie lover's or people that love to build things I love to build things so it is really fun
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Chapman writes in a conversational manner which is easy to read and absorb. I found the material immediately actionable and helpful in understanding my own motivations.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This was my first DeMille book and I must say I enjoyed it. Toward the end it got fairly slow but the John Corey character pulled things through with his sarcastic attitude and quick wit. Overall I would recommend it.
B005GSY23M|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend after we saw the movie because we really liked the music.  It downloaded perfectly and he loved it.  He has listened to it over and over.
0425166805|5.0|Excellent book great writer ,with a great point of view. it is possible , there are many things we can not explain. They could have took apes and chimps and mixed the dna of theirs or even mated with them and we became.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I am usually disappointed by a movie after reading a great book, but not in this case.  What a beautiful job on such a story!  I would recommend this movie to everyone --- and I think I have.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The optimism of the lead character through very turbulent circumstances is inspiring. Visualizing Bradley Cooper as this character the entire read was pretty inspiring as well...
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|This thing runs like an Italian sports car.  As long as it's running, it does exactly what it's supposed to and does it well.  Whenever my phone gives an error message though, I know before I read it that Moon Phase Pro has crashed again.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Pretty boring unless you are into torture.  Would not recommend to adult audiences.  Not for the family.  Nor for those who appreciate our military and our country.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Seems like a bizarre pairing, but they really produced some beautiful work that stands on its own, even if you aren't a Tron fan.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Shows factually how far Republican Party has fallen and how hard their hearts have become..  Historically accurate and well acted.  Would recommend to family or colleagues
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|This book describe the philosophy behind the design of HTML5. It's free, easy to read and could be read in 1-2 hours. The time is worth spending to grasp the big picture and the intention of HTML5 at the begining of the course to discover HTML5
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson has created a vivid and interesting world with The Way of Kings.  A rich a varied cast of characters introduce you to the foreign land with a very unique magic system just being rediscovered.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|This book, the third in the series, is excellent. I could not put this book down! Around every corner is another twist, its so exhilarating. This series as amazing characters and unlike other series, allows the reader to really connect to the characters. I particularly like the fact that although far different from humans, these characters are extremely easy to connect to on a personal level. I hope Miss Clare continues to write her fantastic works. I cannot wait for more to come!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love Downton Abbey!  Had to catch up on Season 2 since I had already seen the others.  Will order more episodes!
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|This book contains everything needed to permanently keep the reader enticed and interested in the world of shadowhunters. This is a series unlike any other and deserves continuous praise! This is an excellent series and I would recommend it to all. Cassandra Clare is an excellent author, who dares to challenge societies flaws. Miss Clare has succeeded in illuminating issues that would otherwise render most ordinary authors crippled amongst readers. I love Clare for challenging real life issues whilst at the same time creating a world that places the reader in another universe. I absolutely cannot get enough of the Mortal Instruments series. I literally cannot wait to pick up the next book.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Although this is a fiction, it gives a quite realistic look at Alzheimer's disease from both the patient and their family's viewpoint.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|As the first book in the series, this book contains everything needed to get any reader hooked. This book is truly excellent as it is possibly one of the first books I have read that contains real characters that can easily be accessed and related to! I love the fact that this book has everything a fantasy book needs but also has elements of the 'mundane' world. It is a wonderful book, wonderful characters, and a wonderful author. I cannot wait for more. I love it! I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fantasy series to entice the imagination but also contains elements of human challenges.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The author has a gift for bringing you into the world of a very different age and lifestyle. Captures the essence of a time most of us are too young to really conceive of. Great character development.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hilarious funny entertaining and. Great for kids and adults to read. So keep up the hard work Jeff peace out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book drove me crazy, but I could barely put it down for all the twists and turns. I was disappointed in the ending, but it held my interest until then.
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best drama and horror tv shows. The tv show hasn't disappointed me yet, it's always leaving me at the edge of the seat. Wondering what's going to happen next.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I read this right before I went back to work from maternity leave.  Lots in this book spoke directly to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever and its way better than minicraft don't buy minicraft buy minecraft way better<br /> I love minecraft so freaking much
1416955070|5.0|Clarissa Fray is an ordinary girl living in New York. Her mother Joselyn who is an artist, her father died before she could meet him, her sort of geeky best friend Simon, and her mother's best friend Luke, who was like a father to her. In this book there is something for everyone, romance, suspense, mystery, and fantasy. Also their are vampires, monsters, warlocks, werewolves, faeries. By half of the book, so much had happened.<br />Jace one of the teenager she saw at the club later explains that he is a Shadowhunter; a secret tribe of warriors dedicated to killing demons. That pretty much opened a can of worms in Clary's life. Her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque demon. What did she get herself into?<br />I loved this book! I \\"accidently\\" (but not really) read the synapses of Book Two, so i found out some secret that hadn't yet been revealed to me. It didn't really spoil anything for me, I just didn't think that the synopses was going to be so revealing. I was sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time i was reading this book. There was always something happening, it was so exciting. I was just thinking \\"I wonder what the other books are going to be like, if this one has so much going on.\\"<br />I like how Cassandra explained how the world looks, I just wish it was written in Clary's point of view. It's basically just being narrated. The villain is awesome, I loved him. The twist, I did not see it coming.<br />What's not to like about this book? Can't wait for book 2!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|So far the game is okay, I was in the middle when I was asked to give a rating. The game has scenes where you have to add things together to make one tool. It's a thinking game ,you have to figure out what to do with certain items. Other times you have a task button that tells you what you need to do and it's up to you to figure out how to do the task at hand.
1416972242|5.0|So much happened in this book! I love the suspense, it is jam packed with non-stop action. I am obsessed with this series. This is the book that I read the synopsis before reading the first book, I did not know it was the second book I think. So I found out pretty much everything, the most important part was that Jace was Clary's brother. I knew because I read it ahead of time, but when I read the first and second book I understood more of what was going on. I love how this world just consumed me, I felt like I was right in the middle of the action. This series is so much fun to read, the world Cassandra Clare created is just amazing. I love the characters, my favorite is Jace, not only because of his beautiful features but because he's so funny. I think he is very rough with Clary, like he doesn't have the time for her. He's witty and oh so funny! I love Jace. Although his relationship with Clary is strange, he does not let anything bad happen to her and he's always by her side whether he agrees with her choices or not.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|It was awesome. A little sad but great. I really can't wait until the next book. I wonder what happens.
0425252868|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and especially learning more at the end of theencounter of the two pilots and how they got in touch. It was especially heartwarming to watch the 2 vieos of the pilots when they found each other. It broght tears to my eyes. Reading the book I could not have imagined how it would end. A excellent book I highly recommend reading.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny, heartwarming, a great flick to share with your kids, whether they are 8 or 18.  Looking forward to the sequel!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Awesome app. All I will ever need to travel along with its rating from other users. No bull, just facts!!!
B000TXZP0S|5.0|I just love watching this movie and never get sick of it.  I'm fascinated by the subject and that this was all going on while I lived in the Bay Area as a kid.  Great acting and a terrific story.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is awesome u can edit pics and make ur own wall and much more like taking pics and writing captions!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|It was all the answers I wanted from where it left off in the last book before this one...... And it read well and gave me new needs and wants and concerns for all the characters..... Until the end. The end is like, not a real satisfying end. I feel like she got towards the end, and kinda hurried and finished it just to finish it. Or got bored with it herself and just ended it. I was very disappointed with the ending.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Loved the music the way they mixed the it and the songs they choose! In the book it gives a little history into each track and why they selected that song or take. Some of the songs I've heard before but never like this, this was a truly amazing cd, must have experience for any real Hendrix fan out there!
0385474547|2.0|Was overcharged by $3!It is listed for $6.55 and I was charged $9.52! Doesn't seem fair to me - never had this problem before.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It is too bad they ended after one season. I enjoyed the series. I plan on downloading the movie, too.
B0044IABFS|5.0|But I still love this show, it was one of my favorites when it was originally on the air.<br />Something about prison shows I have always enjoyed them.<br />They had a good cast, and a good back story to work on.<br />If I hadn't been watching here on Amazon I never would have known there was a &#34;Final Break&#34; then I had never seen.<br />Of course they don't include that in Prime, but I did go out and find a copy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app is a lot of fun. I like that its always adding new quests & things to do. If there was 1 thing I'd change it would be the amount of time it takes to regenerate your energy. I don't like spending actual money on games so its a lot of waiting sometimes & its frustrating. Otherwise I love it!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Still on of the best sci-fi shows to only ever get one season.<br />Joss should have brought this show back on some other network, heck the amount of playtime it gets on different networks running the full series in a row is scary.<br />And each time it does I always watch at least one episode.<br />If you have never seen it, here is your chance.
0679729895|5.0|I bought this book having read all the stories before as a child. Dahl was a master of the twist ending, and his technique of cutting the story off just before it finishes (as in 'Taste') allows everyone to come to their own conclusions. I use these stories in class occasionally, and they always go down a treat!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|When Frank McCourt was teaching high school English in America his students suggested he should publish a book of the stories from his youth that he sometimes told them.  The result is &#34;Angela's Ashes.&#34;  Angela was McCourt's mother.  The book was originally intended to end with Frank and his brother taking her ashes back to Limerick, to her family's burial ground.  But it got too long, so was split into two books, leaving a rather enigmatic title for the first volume.  I think it would have made more sense to reverse the titles of the two books, calling this one &#34; 'Tis &#34; and the second &#34;Angela's Ashes.&#34;  Either way, it's a wonderful and absorbing personal memoir.  I much prefer listening to the author's reading of it in the audio form.  His Irish accent is like music to the ear.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose the book instead of the movie. Whether you believe it or not  it's a very entertaining story. The imagination of the author is excellent. Now I want to see the movie.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Love Spielberg, and the acting in this movie was superb, but the content was deep and sometimes because of the style of speech I could not tell really how the people felt about the 13 Amendment. Historically very good.
B006OEPITO|5.0|Siddhartha remains one of the most essential books to explore.  Though it is written by one of Germany's leading authors, Herman Hesse, the book takes the reader back to ancient times in the East.  This is a spiritually fulfilling book that helps raise consciousness to a higher level.  A MUST read for those who want to be knowledgeable.  It is one of the great books of modern times.  I read it in my youth, and now I have read it again in my later years.  It comes to life and has so much more meaning the second time around.  It is a beautiful book.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I love the whole series. And is was so well done. It goes with book as well as it can considering how much goes on in the book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So glad we checked to see what all the Downton Abbey talk was about.<br />The character development is remarkable, very engaging.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I and my kids enjoy playing it.  Better scenery and action then Temple 1.  I wish i was as good as my kids.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is so addictive! I haven't played solitaire in years but now that I have a Kindle Fire, I play this game<br />more than I should.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great love this product, fun way to read your books, annoyed I have to use all these words, really why?
B001EBROWQ|5.0|I loved this movie, very powerful with good actors.  Like all Jesus movies it does have its inaccuracies though,  If you read your bible you'll know.  Other than that its a must watch.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I PICKE DTHIS MOVIE CAUSE I LIKE READING STORIES ABOUT VAMPIRES AND WERREWOLFS AND SHAPESHIFTERS. THIS IS A CLEAN MOVIE THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD WATCH.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I have this on my Kindle HD and it's wonderful.  Feels faster than the stock browser with more options for customization.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I think the first two seasons had more draw and events to them. I dislike the loss of certain characters but that is part of the story. The ending does not leave you hanging as much as the others so I have less desire or anticipation to see more.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Movie was well done. Equipment and uniforms were spot on. Movie you could enjoy again and again. Makes you ponder what serving in this branch was really like
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Justin Timberlake's Latest Album Is Sonically Adventurious, But It Somehow Works! Forget The Sound Of Justin's 2 Previous Albums- This Album Explores New Territory, But In A Wonderful Way!! Most Of The Songs Are Over The 6 Minute Mark, This May Sound Like A Dreadful Notion, But It's Actually One Of The Albums Strengths. I Will Try To Explain The Unique Structure Of The Songs That Accounts For Their Length, It Appears Like JT Made Each Song To Be Around The 4 Minute Mark & Then Had A Remix For Each Song Made- It Sounds Like Each Song Begins With The First Half Of The Remix, Then In The Middle You Have The Actual 4 Minute Song, Followed By The 2nd Half Of The Remix. The Amazing Thing Is The Unique Approach To Song Structure Actually Works! The Only Issue I Have With The Album Is That Some Of The Songs, Due To The Nature Of The Remixed Portions, Results In JT Repeating Short Lyrical Phrases Over & Over Again Which Can Sometimes Get A Little Annoying. Most Of The Songs On This Album Are Mid-Tempo, But With So Many Sonic Changes Taking Place During Each Song The Album Rarely Stagnates Or Is Boring. I Especially Like The Tracks 'Pusher Love Girl', 'Suit & Tie', 'Don't Hold The Wall', 'Mirrors' And The Standout Song For Me Is 'Blue Ocean Floor'(The Intended Album Closing Track, Which Leaves A Great Lasting Impression. I Should Point Out That The Standard Album Has Ten Tracks, Clocking In At Just Over 70 Minutes Playing Time- I Would Suggest Buying The Deluxe Edition Because You Get Two Extra Songs, These Great Bonus Tracks Are Both Shorter In Length & Follow A More Standard Song Structure And Extend The Playing Time To Just Over 79 Minutes!! The Deluxe Edition Also Has A Slightly Different And Better Album Cover- You Get To See The Upper Half Of His Body And Justin's Entire Face, Which Is Strangely Covered Up On The Standard Edition Album Cover. This Album Is Really A Must Have For Your Music Collection!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Despite the haters, who are generally fans of the stage versions, this film version is a huge success in combining great closeup acting and emotion with passionate singing. The story itself is timeless!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie was great, best Bond movie so far! Action packed and keeps you interested! Can't wait till the next one!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Well, with larger screen to play card games, I felt it kept me interested, and I WON a lot..  that's the key. haha.. Pmps
B008602KQI|5.0|I purchased this movie initially because my grandson went to see it and I wanted to know what he was exposed to as he is 12 years old.  I was truly expecting not liking it, but I surprised myself as I ended up loving it.  The idea where kids are killing kids is deplorable in order to win your life and go back home a hero is pretty haunting, but this movie brought out the humanity as well.  To see the different types of personalities which depict how some of the kids really enjoyed the killing of humans, and also displayed the hearts of kids who really cared for one another and only defended themselves and protected others was so important.  The Hunger Games was enjoyable because of one young lady had a good heart, which showed immediately when she took the place of her younger sister; she stood in her sister's stead.  Love was also in The Hunger Games; let's not dismiss that!  This one young lady made the difference, and changed many people by just being herself.  The writer, with the producer and director, and the rest of the filming staff really did well in my opinion.  They were very sensitive and caring how this movie was made.  I encourage you to see this with an open mind, and grasp the message of this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Same results, I win, it's easy to see, play and time flies when playing.. pmps  Come on. I won't reply to these with all this nonsense about how many words... I have Mahjong to play.. not type...
B0044MIIA4|5.0|Absolutely love this album. One of the best out of Northern Europe in a long time. The follow albums are great also
B000TERDNO|5.0|This album encompasses my entire high school career from 10th through 12th grade and graduation. Lots of good memories associated with each song. I love it!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I guess this futuristic view of the world is possible but this is really extreme! Imagine making a sport out of survival of the smartist.

1936608618|5.0|I strongly recomend this book for Fitness exercise, specially for crossfiters........<br />Good explanatios and photos , very pactical and easy going
1451668945|5.0|I was anxious waiting for the arrival of this book, delivered this morning. There was no way one can begin to read this thrilling story, and put it down to finish later. That doesn't work with this author. New York Times bestselling author, Mary Higgins Clark delivers another thriller Masterpiece of intense suspense throughout. More exiting for me with a picture-perfect setting of where I resided 45 years of my life. I felt like I was there when the explosion took place. A furniture firm goes up in flames, Gus is dead, and Kate is in a coma. Who is a prime suspect, who will reveal the truth, and will justice be served? Is a killer walking the streets, and what evidence is found. This compelling crime story is suspenseful throughout with colorful characters in a puzzling mystery, searching for answers for questions covered in suspicion. The drama becomes intense as bits-and-pieces of the mysterious puzzle begin to find its proper place. Will there be more terror, before the crime is solved? One can feel the anxiety and frustration as the investigation begins with nail-biting suspense. 'Daddy's Gone A Hunting' is a crime thrilling page-turner, and will not disappoint. Chilling, exciting, and filled with suspense from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved watching this. Heard so many different things about this from friends and family so I figure I would give it a try.  Totally lived up to my expectations.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A good script made awesome by incredible actors!  I loved the characters!  It's one of those movies you can watch again and again.
B004SUDQE0|1.0|I'm not going to comment on the movie itself.  If you're considering buying the movie, then you must like it.  I do too.  This will be a short and simple review on the quality of the picture and sound and extras.  Well, REALLY short in terms of the extras because there are none.  As for picture quality, clearly this DVD was not made from an original master print of the film.  Most likely, it's just a copy of the original VHS video that was sold just after the 1995 theatrical release.  There is no evidence that anyone even remotely attempted to source a quality print of the film for this DVD.  When viewed on a modest 52\\" Sony Bravia television, there was clearly visible pixellation that would not normally be present on a quality DVD sourced from a quality print.  The sound suffers the same low-resolution problems as the video.  The audio is probably just stereo format which makes no use of modern home theatre set-ups despite the claim that this DVD was released in 2011.  So, buyer beware.  Buy it you love the film but, for me, it's not worth the low resolution annoyances and overall poor quality.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A true insight of everyday life, of this distinguished elite group that protect our nation. I applaud them for all they do.
B001EC2IV2|4.0|If you like Arnold Schwarzenegger films, then you will like this one.  It is cut from the same cloth as many of his movies - action, cuns, bombs, explosions, cars, women, and one - line gems from Arnold.  It has all of his schtick, and I had fun watching it.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I do not like the fact that you have to restart from the beginning every time you want to replay a segment.  & it is always trying to force me to buy.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What's not to love?  This show is hilarious and I received my purchase very quickly.  Investing in &#34;prime&#34; is a must if you make frequent purchases, 2 day free shipping is great.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This movie was made back when they knew how to make movies. I will never get tired of watching it.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I would recommend this to a friend. It was a little slow, but the acting was really good. It shows the time it puts in to find one man, that was amazing.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is always excellent in his performance. It is a good movie and I think need to be seen.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it to any one that is looking for a story that will take them on a journey.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much. It is a great movie with talented cast. I rented the movie and will buy it later definitely.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Overall the book was pretty good. The only problem I had was scrambled pages with weird symbols. At first I though they were speaking an other language, but then I notice that it was not the case. So yeah, I was really annoyed; however it was not so much of a biggy to figure what was happening though I missed details, and it was what annoyed me. Anyway as I say overall the book was good it had action, romance, thriller, suspense...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Loved the graphics. Kept me interested. Enjoyed the storyline and the ability to skip it when I chose to. Fun for all ages.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It,s very challenging and the graphics are awsome. I keep playing it for long periods of time very addicting handgun.
B004FS1TLM|5.0|He's still got it and best of all he will for many more years! He's better than Frank Sinatra ever was.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I played all types of minecraft games. The amount of items you are able to use its horrible. Thank graphics are nice. Controls are nice. The amount of space is horrible. Barely any caves. I can't wait for the new update. But this is something fun to do when you are bored.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I had low expectations for this movie, and the trailers did nothing to enlighten viewers of the real jewel that this movie is. I was pleasantly surprised and found myself fully engaged in the plot, the characters, and the performances. Add the fact that there was some good humor and this movie is a must own.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|You can run really fast and get good scores. Lots of levels and areas to explore. Can't wait til the next part of OZ reveals its self. OUT!
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Stick with the original Bourne movies. This one was crap. There was no chemistry between the two lead actors. The plot was garbage. This guy is no Bourne. Bourne isn't even in this movie. I literally was bored trying to get through this.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|perfect and came very fast :) . . . . . . . . . .  . . . ..
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie grows on you. I wasn't really impressed at first viewing; the kids loved it. Now that they have made me watch it several times a week for the past year, I like it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|So there was no way I was NOT going to like Thor. I loved Thor in the comic books - starting for me in the 1960's. I expected to see a sort of remake of the comic book scene. I was pleasantly surprised by the science twist they gave the whole movie. Anthony Hopkins as Woden as a stroke of genius.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was not sure about the beginning of this series, but it eventually grabbed on and took off. I am already losing quite a bit of sleep trying to read just one more chapter and I love it.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|I was initially turned off by the crude 70s production values. But, Mr. Bronowski's presentation very quickly makes that irrelevant. His perspective on human evolution was engaging and insightful - rich fodder for the mind. He applauds rigorous scientific inquiry and reminds that the pursuit of truth through science, when free of politics and sometimes even when not, enriches our understanding of the universe and propels us forward as a race. He also illuminates the price that many of our scientific free thinkers of the past paid to advance this knowledge.<br /><br />The modern mind seems reactionary and superstitious when compared with this careful study and analysis of human development. Questioning premises is no longer de rigeur and is actively resisted in modern discourse. We live in a time of fear and clinging to established belief structures. The only new thought allowed is in the tech/medical sector. Everything else is a push for utopia and all of the authoritarian madness and controlling mechanisms that that implies.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this series, particularly his insights about the waste of human potential that he posits in the final episode. I have ruminated on this same line of thought many times in my life. My early education was poor and my questions were shut down and deflected because answering them would have challenged the adults I asked them of beyond their comfort zones. Had I found a true teacher who respected scientific and philosophical inquiry, as Mr. Bronowski does, then my life path might have been far different. Alas, those types of teachers are rare. We need more of them to spark our youth if we are ever to move out of the dull sludge that passes for intellectual thought these days.<br /><br />I have always yearned to live in a society where curiosity is not a crime. Mr. Bronowski made that possible for a few sweet, short hours of illuminated exposition. Truly an enjoyable series. I highly recommend this for anyone.
B008133MDK|5.0|VERY ENJOYABLE--USE THE CAPTIONS--The dialogue is quick and sometimes not understandable--The whole first season was great-Can't wait for the new season
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Chicklis is at his best. Well written and acted, this series has a lot of action, so is not for the weak of heart. You will enjoy.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Freaking awesome! Excellent, easily controlled retro game. Very playable on a capacitive device - certainly surprised me. Kudos for creating a great leap into yesteryear.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This may well have been one of the best seasons ever as the plot thickens.  I can't wait for Season Four.
B00BEBJEY2|4.0|The 11th album from the Glasgow, Scotland band, written for a French TV series (The Returned).<br /> Darkly atmospheric cinema soundscapes that are imbued with a subtly worrisome sense of calm<br /> & beauty; as though the sun has risen on another day, but there's a chance it could explode at<br /> any moment.  Nonetheless, there is no escaping the gently dreamy roar of flowing power here.<br /> Meditative music for willing explorers.  Nice.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Just like the movie although  one song(Closet) was omitted, it still ranks better than any other production of the original cast or otherwise.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can spend any amount of time playing this simple game. It amazes me to think what algorithms must be used in the product to come up with puzzles
B008EKOO46|4.0|This book was full of great facts and stories. It was presented in a very logical way, yet it did not put me to sleep. However, the author is sometimes repetitive and presents stories that have the same underlying theme. Maybe I'm too eager to get to the point, but his explanations were somewhat drawn out in that way.<br /><br />Overall, this was still a great read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested.
0394818237|5.0|I would recommend the Richard Scarry books to anyone with kids. I love reading them to my kids because I had the same books as a child!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have always wanted to read this classic, but found it much too heavy reading in my younger days.  Not so now.  Since it is a classic, I decided to give it another try.  I am happy that I did.  I can not imagine why I did no read it before.A​s a history, it delves deeply into the birth of a nation, maybe rebirth is a better definition.  It is also a wonderful story which made me laugh at times an actually brought tears to my eyes, at others.  The language is so evocative, you actually feel as if you are on the barricades.  Anyone who downloads this book will love it as much as I do.  And, the price is right - $0.00!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Not a big fan of some of the story lines, but the show is entertaining and is very different from some of the shows on tv..
B009AMANBA|3.0|Abraham Lincoln is perhaps the closest thing (besides maybe MLK Jr) we have to an American saint.  Along with the founding fathers has been deified, and nary a ill word can be said about him.  The movie is primarily about the machinations behind the passage of the 13th Amendment, that noble law that freed the slaves, but also paved the way for the South's crushing \\"reconstruction\\" and the reign of the Republican party for the next 70 years, with a few vignettes about Lincoln thrown in, which, though following the textbook view of the saintly 16th President, does accurately portray the consummate politician that he was, as conniving and dishonest as any other politician you can think of.  But the pivotal scene in which Rep. Fernando Wood of New York spouts the truth about Lincoln: that he was a tyrant who basically stepped all over the constitution, suspended the writ of Habeas Corpus, led 600,000 men to their deaths, invented non-existent war powers, harassed and even imprisoned the opposition--is accurate, but it is played for laughs, so that it is Wood who is seen as the crazy radical.<br /><br />The movie is filled with Spielbergian artificial sentimentality.  From the ludicrous opening scene, where a black soldier is seen spouting off the Gettysburg Address in front of Lincoln with the diction of a Cicero, to the final scene where a misty-eyed magic negro servant knows, just knows that something really bad is going to happen as Lincoln hobbles away for his date night, with countless scenes of blacks delivering moralizing lectures in between, you'd think the 19th Century America was Black365 like it is today.  Though Lincoln, as any enlightened individual of that era, considered slavery abhorrent, he most definitely did not think blacks and whites were meant to live together in this country.  He was a big supporter of the repatriation movement, and the one and only time he entertained a black delegation at the White House was to encourage them to go back to Africa.  The only reason Lincoln freed the slaves was to ensure the destruction of the South and end the right of secession.  That's it.  If he could have done it by keeping slavery in tact, he would have, as he admitted himself.<br /><br />The movie, though not Spielberg's best, is certainly well crafted, though a little slow and you feel a bit cheated at the end.  It almost makes you wish someone like Oliver Stone had made it.  Stone, though in the same liberal camp as Spielberg, is at least not afraid to be offensive.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|While its no Finding Nemo or The Incredibles, its an enjoyable romp for the whole family.  Of note, the voice-over work by the actors was impressive, especially Jude Law as Pitch.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|How rare it is to see a wonderfully clean movie that is so good that you don't even think about how clean it is until after the movie's over, and then - \\"Wow, what a gem\\"!  The perfect family movie, and a spectacular 3D movie as well.
B00BHMF578|4.0|My husband and I have been appreciating history, especially those events we &#34;missed&#34; while we were teens.  Argo is amazing in its recount of a tremendously risky plot to foil the Iranians during the hostage crisis.  The movie was interesting and well-made, but not quite what we would have expected from &#34;Best Movie&#34;--good, but not incredible.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|I like Tarantino movies and this movie has Tarantino all over it.  There are definitely some absurd parts, but overall it was a lot of fun to watch.  If you like a blood and guts action/kung-fu movies then you will like this.
0062014536|5.0|Lena's world was rocked once again when she discovered that Alex didn't die during her escape as she once though...but he bitter and not the same Alex she knew back in Portland. She is unsure of how to balance her relationships with Alex and Julian while staying focused on the building momentum of the resistance. Meanwhile, Lena's once best friend Hana has undergone the cure for her deliria and is preparing for her marriage to the mayor of Portland. Yet, Hana can't help but feel as if something is still wrong with her, and she's been thinking about Lena a lot lately. As the conflict heightens between the resistance and Hana's world, the girls are slowly drawn together once again in a tense, emotional reunion that will force each girl to finally make a decision about where she stands.<br /><br />Requiem is a wonderfully written conclusion to the Delirium Trilogy. Oliver balances Lena and Hana's perspectives well, giving readers a glimpse of each side of the conflict, revealing Hana's motivations for her actions in previous books, and exploring the mind and motivations of one who has received the cure. Oliver really ratchets up the tension and violence in this third book; the resistance is in greater danger, facing betrayals, sudden attacks, and armies of the cured. Throughout all of this peril, Lena ponders what exactly it is that she is fighting for when life seems so dire and love has gotten complicated. Oliver uses the Biblical story of Solomon, the two women, and the baby as a metaphor for the complicated relationships Lena has with Julian, Alex, and her mother, and as a way to address the duality of love and war, and the freedom to choose right or wrong. It's a very apt story, and also works to show the warped sensibilities of those fighting for a cure for love, and by the time Lena finally understands the story, she is certain in the decisions she makes and the actions she takes. The ending of the trilogy is unexpected, but surprisingly fitting. Oliver doesn't try to sell a happy, shiny conclusion, but instead ends with hope, a promise, and a manifesto to lead to a better future. Requiem is completely engrossing and a breathtakingly beautiful final book in this trilogy.try to sell a happy, shiny conclusion, but instead ends with hope, a promise, and a manifesto to lead to a better future.

B000HKYN74|5.0|The pace of season 1 and 2 is slow, some of epochs are not very interesting.  However, the season 3 and 4 are excellent.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was great, it kept me going and I couldn't put it down. I was very disappointed with the ending though. I would still recommend the book to people to read.
B00164KYV4|5.0|Several stories going on and some a predictable but I still enjoyed this and I got it at a great price.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had watched the first movie not having a clue what the books were about and then I was hooked. I read all 3 books and the only sad part is that I want more!!!  These are def. a must read!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Maybe I've read too much really good sci-fi at this point... The premise and plot are fun, and interesting.  The 80s references get a bit tiring after a while.  For a younger reader (ironically) I think it'd be a neat discovery-of-the-past vehicle.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great read, well researched and well written. Being an old P51 fighter pilot in that war, I found the German viewpoint in the book rewarding. We were all fighter pilots first and enemies second. It is difficult to hate a man who is doing the same job and involved  with the same problems you are. It's nice to be alive.<br /><br />R Palson

B008XG1X18|5.0|Great way to stay organized and to be inspired, see something you like pin it to your board for later. My favorite pins are Garden and recipes.
1416914307|2.0|I was extremely disappointed when I received my hardcover copy of this book. I'm a book collector and purchased it because the description clearly advertised it as \\"First Edition edition\\"; when it arrived, it was a recent reprint, not a first edition as the description claimed. So let the buyer beware- things are not always what they are advertised!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is a great movie too bad they split it in two. I was super happy with how it played out and that Harry survived the whole ordeal. Great for the movie collection
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was a little difficult to get into at first - the style was a bit different, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  The characters had such depth, and the book allowed the reader to experience such a wide range of emotions.  I found myself wanting to reread this book after I finished, because it was so perfect.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|A great story of ups and downs with a happy ending. Lots of action and one of uncle ron's favorite movies. I highly recomend this movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just as fun and challenging as the rest of the Angry Birds adventures. Our grand kids thoroughly enjoy it.<br />Thanks for the freebie!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I love the game. But when I opened it up today 4-9-2013 I got a message saying my version is too old and I need to update it. When I do what it tells me to I get nothing game is stuck other than that it was fun up to now.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Very interesting read.<br />I can learn to like these even though they are same type stories.<br />I hate having to write a book to rate a book.

B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel Washington is a superb actor.  His portrayal of an alcoholic was on the money.  The movie was a bit dark but definitely worth watching.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|This is, without any question, late-1960s production values.  In this day and age, there was none of the multi-tracking that Queen later applied to Bohemian Rhapsody--instead of having 96 tracks to work with, people of this day had only recently been blessed with more than one.  So on tracks such as &#34;You Got Me Floating,&#34; the &#34;mind-blowing studio effects&#34; can seem gloriously like canned goods.  And the auditory and lyrical fashion of the times ring out as garishly as Hendrix's clothing fashions did. But God, is it pure.  I mean, this is a pure communication, from the artists to the audiences they were trying to reach.<br /><br />Every artist is calculating, because they're all trying to affect people.  But Hendrix was never calculating in a careless, phoned-in sort of way.  He wanted to go deep.  Here, he does.  &#34;If Six Was Nine&#34; is the best example of this, I suppose.  It recalls the Doors' &#34;The End,&#34; or &#34;When the Music's Over,&#34; in the way it draws you in for a think, and illustrates it with all these musical flourishes.  The guitar can't be critiqued, because it's all been said; the incredible, wiry Mitch Mitchell gives the same sort of staccato, strobe-effect snare blasts that the Doors' John Densmore did; and Noel Redding's bass cannonballs marvelously into the pool, like Hurley from Lost belly-flopping from a high-dive.  The songs bridge the gap between the first album's 2:50 pop, and Electric Ladyland's experiments.  If you only get one Hendrix album, this should be it!
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  It is super funny and heart warming as well.  I highly recommend watching it if you are in your late 30's or early 40's!
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Beautiful movie, one of my absolute favorites. I always laugh and cry during this movie. Will be one of your favorites too.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Hell of alot cheaper than at stores and still great quality. not a scratch on it and plays all the way through. I would never buy this at a store. too expensive!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Concept - OK. Writing - OK. The inconsistent characters were very annoying. I just found the whole series frustrating. I want to finish the story but I have no idea where it is headed, I really can't see this finishing with the next installment.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. Wish it had subtitles when they spoke in foreign language. Otherwise it had a good plot.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I love this app you can talk to friend's manage groups and buy games and its FREE great way to talk to friends on the go (as long as you have wifi you can still find things just not that)
B008P9M614|5.0|Addictive if you like medical mysteries and dry wit. House is a complex, layered man you hate to love. You can't help but laugh at his obnoxious antics, most of them to figure out the puzzle. And as much as he tries to be a misanthrope, his humanity often shines through the gruff exterior. A pleasure to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They copied temple run if you got Sydney version but overall it's awesome and addicting super fun and I have to use twenty characters and reappeared word don't count why Amazon why
B005HSL626|5.0|I love to play Fruit ninja, my granddaughter age 5, loves to play as well.  Easy to pick up.  Even with my arthritis I can do!
B001OSIV62|4.0|An amazing story and amazing man who never knew what couldn't be done. I wish I could meet him in person.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|game freezes and then goes to the main screen like you exited it..i like the hame but needs some more tweaking for it to be top shelf..there is that twenty...good grief why does it have to be twenty!!!<br />i put twenty words downnwhat gives
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I bought this cd because of the song The book of Love, and maybe because this is the first cd that Peter is just an interpreter it's so special. Great one.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This app is great. I can squeeze in a quick workout when I get a chance (5, 10, 15 min) or go for longer if I have the time. I can also choose to focus on a particular area (abs, arms, legs, etc) or Full Body/Cardio for FREE. There is also a video showing how to do each exercise. Five stars for me - way more than I expected from a free app.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Never thought I'd enjoy reading books on something as small as my Galaxy III but this app works great.  Kudos to the developers and designeers.  The dictionary functionality is better than on my Kindle.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is one of those movies that someone can watch over and over and never get tired of it.  Ghost Protocol, in my opinion, is the best of the Mission:  Impossible films.  Watch it!
B0095MVOMC|4.0|good graphics, interesting locations. some of the darker scenes are hard on the eyes. all in all a good time
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I have been hooked on this show since I saw the first one. Really a new but good spin on the Sherlock Holmes character. Happy that I can download it on Amazon videos!!!!!!
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|We have ordered all of the Panda games for our 3 1/2 yr old. They are so fun and great for fine motor skills. We have actually played them, they are entertaining even to adults! I hope they come out with more. We esp like the Dr. Panda and restaurant Panda
1451696191|5.0|It's a really interesting and quick read. It captures the reader's attention. Good for teens in high school. Some mature content iffy for middle school grades.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked it because it was from the point of view of a kid who gets bullied because of the way he looks. I also like how it has the point of view from his friends and family. It has a good message; its not whats on the outside that counts.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|We grew up in the 1980s watching The Snowman each year and love this product and anything related to the original film and story. You can't go wrong sharing this gorgeous artistic film and its glorious boy choir musical score...just amazing.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Audio/Video: 10<br />Movie: 8<br /><br />I bought this Black Friday 2012 for $14.99. I chose to get this in 3D not because I own a 3D HDTV but because I wanted to watch the bonus bluray content. The normal bluray version doesn't come with it, which sucks. Now the bonus disc was great! BUT<br />in an interview, Ridley mentioned at least one deleted scene that would appear on the &#34;special edition&#34; that we're not getting here. Also promised an early version of the script, while the film was still a hardcore ALIEN prequel. That was supposed to be on the &#34;second screen&#34; app. Due to ambiguous legal reasons, that's not happening.<br /><br />I sold this a while ago because there isn't much replay value.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Highly recommended read of Adam Brown; a person that lived like no other and provided inspiration for all.  This is a story of hope and faith.
B008M721MS|3.0|The app has everything I really need but it lacks stability. The app crashes roughly five to six times a day. I wish it wouldn't crash so much if it didn't I would've  given it maybe q 5 star rating. I do hope that sometime soon you create group calls an  not misanthropy chats.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love this game!  I play it every single day.  The display is gorgeous.  I enjoyed &#34;travelling&#34; around the world while I advanced the levels.  I'm going back now and earning more stars on levels I already passed.  I have spent more time enjoying and using this app than I have on any other single app on my Kindle.
B004AUNSX2|1.0|The movie itself is good but the streaming quality<br />was awful, laggy, buffering etc.<br />I have a high speed fibre connection, the same movie with Netflix<br />was perfect.<br />Biggest complaint is the lack of 5.1 audio despite it being advertised<br />as 5.1 it was not. Again, Netflix produced great 5.1 audio HD.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I used this a lot for a few days when I set up my new router.  It helped me select a channel with the least interference from my neighbors.  I would recommend it for that.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is just as addictive as Temple Run 2! Great graphics and just as challenging.  The kids enjoy it as much as I do.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I view this every time I open my Kindle.  It showed me how fast the battery runs down using 3D games, and how fast it charges back up using the accessory fast charger.  I like knowing what's going on inside my Kindle.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is a very fun game u eat people and u her them scream and you get different stuff on it like antidotes ans a jacket but there is danger u have to go through bombs when you go deep
B006HL9G10|5.0|I got this as a free app, but the bell sound alone is worth paying for.  I haven't used it for formal meditation.  I just sit still and listen to the bell timer and breathe deeply.  It's a gorgeous sound! I plan to use it more often.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great show. A little disappointed with the packaging. The discs slide in and out of a flimpsy cardboard folder. For the price, they could have made the packaging a little nicer. But, like I said, great show. Follows the books well. I highly recommend.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I'm hard to impress about TV shows, especially beginnings. First episodes-- even for good ones-- can be awkward, with the cast and writers not yet finding the chemistry.<br /><br />This one hit managed to hit maximum speed seconds after it began, and then spent the rest of the show proving there was more to spare. Somehow, it did this without sacrificing character development. Thanks to co-creator John Fawcett's taut direction, and remarkable performances by Tatiana Maslani as three physically identical women with distinct personalities, accents and mannerisms. She even plays one mimicking another, with her cockney accent wavering.<br /><br />The story is about Sarah, a young woman surviving on the margins as a hustler and a drug dealer, who's just walked out on her boyfriend. She witnesses a stranger identical to herself, Beth, commit suicide. Sarah steals and assumes her identity. Despite the fact that Sarah had little to lose, it turns out this was not the best move. The mysterious pink cellphone and a recently loaded savings account hint at the weird secrets that drove Elizabeth to suicide.<br /><br />The show has one gamble in its structure, that is, Sarah is not a likeable character. Even if you can't warm up to her anti-heroism, you might still enjoy the trouble she brings on herself and still admire the cleverness she shows. Maslani's remarkable performance generates fascination. I expect that as the plot continues to unfold, we'll see Sarah's other better qualities.<br /><br />Maslani seems like a chameleon, and co-Creator, Fawcett, is the best filmmaker out of Canada, having made the timeless horror movie &#34;Ginger Snaps.&#34;  I'm hooked. I've already bought it for the rest of the season.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said by her many devoted fans such as myself. The CD re-visits some of their old songs with fresh arrangements. The DVD finally delivers concert footage we have waited patiently for even though it is not as long as I would have preferred.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to their next album and still believe they are the best thing to come out of England in many, many years.<br /><br />Corrine's vocal delivery is second to none while Andy's melodies always deliver something new while echoing something great from the past.<br /><br />Swing Out Sister represents complex, quality music that can be listened to for hours at a time...especially in this time of weak performances by most other artists listened to in America today. England has given us the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton and so many others from an endless list of great musicians and I put Swing Out Sister on that same list.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Not my type of movie, more of a kids movie.y grandkids love the movie. Great price.easy to order and great service. Buy all my movies and Cds from amazo..
B00005NNMJ|5.0|I have'nt heard this great metal band in years.I saw them 20 years ago @ a club and at 5'2 Udo commands the stage.thanks for the flashback
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Great action and story line.  Love the realistic reaction of the school administration and the students.  Tommy plays a great role as the dark hero.  Never Tap!
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I find it is a great news source, but it shuts down for no reason quite often. I am at my wits end. I will rate it higher when and if they ever fix the bugs in it.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|The book is quite interesting, though a bit repeating in the later chapters. However the Kindle version is lacking all the images (like maps etc.) which makes it hard to follow the descriptions sometimes.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|I thought the story line to the movie was very good and had some good surprises and an interesting ending.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|Michael Shannon is an intense action, tighly wound, always realy to deliver a dramtic and fierce body of work.  This movie was no different.  Here we find a fiercely loyal, proud, and independent man being confreonted with the possibility that he is slipping into mental ilness.  He attempts to self diagnose, seek counseling, avoid his friends to shield  them and his family from his worsening conditions only to make matters worse.
0201633612|5.0|This book revolutionized the terminology and vocabulary over object oriented programming (OOP) almost two decades ago, including terms already dispersed in OO literature (factories, builders, commands,...). The introduction is priceless, a brief introduction of OOP, defining concepts (types, interfaces, implementation, classes), and pronouncing some invaluable principles (e.g. \\"Program to an interface, not an implementations\\". I commonly use a set of these patterns (about 15), but every one of them shows up good design decisions. This book isn't for novice programmers, but I recommend it to any experienced programmer with good knowledge of any object oriented language. The book surely made visible that knowing an OO language isn't the same as making OO programming.
B005LAII1C|5.0|To put it mildly, I laughed my ass off&#34;.  It's juvenile, crass, crude, and foul mouthed and also funny as a hell.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This youtube downloader is so much better than Playtube!!  It works perfectly on my kindle fire.  It allows me to save music videos in my &#34;personal videos&#34; section on my device.  You also have the option to save just the audio in your MP3 (music) section.  Unlike playtube, which takes forever to begin playing the saved videos, and constantly stops & starts, this app plays instantly & all the way through each and every time!  I am delighted with this app and you will be too!  It deserves 10 stars!!!!!!
1439190275|4.0|I got this book because my sister wanted to start a Ketogenic diet , I have no idea what she is trying to do.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Like... really really big. I look like an air-traffic controller wearing this piece. My family hates me and implies I work at McDonalds. My life is awful now, but video games are like really good with this thing so that's the only important thing.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Don't ever give up on life. This book is proof that even in the worst circumstances life has meaning. i would recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps you wanting to watch the next episode right away...like a good book.  It always ends with you wanting to see what is going to happen.  Never thought I would get so hooked!!  Hate to see my favorites die though  :(
B000TRXRUY|4.0|Liked this movie a lot. Bruce Lee has a lot of philosophy stuff going on too. Made me think a long time after watching it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. Lots more detail than weather.com we check it every day. Makes a great planning tool for day trips and traveling.
1451695195|5.0|I had not read a book in years, but once I started reading this one I could not put it down. I read the whole book on a plane.
B008602KQI|4.0|It was good, but I would not let Children watch.<br />There are killings through out the movie. And finally no<br />skin on skin stuff !
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It challenged me--and made me be alert. I like that. good way to refresh yourself after tedious work.<br /> I enjoyed playing it.
B005LAIISA|2.0|We wanted more clean movies to watch, so got this one.<br />Now that said..we are in our 50's.<br />There are a few things that they never needed to put in.<br />We never enjoy seeing that!<br />Come on..... our Children should not have that in their movies.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Good read, excellent story... Interesting descriptions of the blitz and the life in London during the war.  The secret was kept until the end and was flabagasted to discover the truth.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I have been looking SOO forward to the last book about Harry, his friends and family. Maybe I have been too excited, cause the book didn't live up to my expectations. I hated some of the characters, and that was probably the point, but it ruined the experience for me. But I still love Harry and his crowd! And would not miss it for the world.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I had distoryed my phone and was having to use my Kindle for an alarm clock and this worked really great! Since I had my kindle by my bed each night, I would just leave it charging and it woke me every morning!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|App is okay but unfortunately I don't have a lot to sync with and I find this app is not as easy to use as they actually say.  So for me a simple easy to use app is quite nice for me.  I do hope those with a busier lifestyle will indeed enjoy this app more.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I was originally disappointed that this was not a spin-off from Smallville with Justin Hartley playing the title role, I have been won over.  This version is darker than I usually like, but the casting and acting is excellent.  I am concerned about the show getting too dark, though, I think they need to be careful about writing Emily Bett Rickards' role as Felicity in to a corner where it becomes more like her reprising Allison Mack's Chloe (that's no knock on Chloe, who I think could have had a spin-off of her own).<br /><br />I like the way they keep pulling in characters and references to the comic book version of Green Arrow, but I don't like the constant heavy focus on calling him a &#34;killer&#34;.  The point is supposed to be that he CAN kill when necessary, not that he will kill when convenient.  I'm also concerned that they are already somewhat repeating story lines and trying to create &#34;arch enemies&#34;.  I don't think that approach to story telling actually benefits the character.  Better to come up with new challenges than continually returning to easy content.  Arch enemies get old fast.  Smallville suffered from it when they had the &#34;Kryptonite villian of the week&#34;, Sherlock Holmes suffered from it until they finally killed off Moriarty, Batman is mired in it.  I think it significantly detracts from good story telling and character development.<br /><br />But, so far, it's a great show.
B00932DCS8|5.0|Don't really ever watch foreign films, and really hate sub titles....this movie, however was WELL worth it!  Acton packed, extremely twisty...much more complex than the description would lead you to believe.  I would highly recommend it to any mystery/thriller fan...even if you normally shy away from foreign films, you'll be glad you did!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The Writing is excellent, and I enjoy that stories and characterizations are derived from Conan Doyle's actual writings.  I also like the way it's been updated to modern times instead of making it a period piece.  It allows for interesting twists and deviance that current viewers can relate to and understand without having to reconcile what was possible at a time when they were not born yet.  Of course without the excellent portrayal by the actors, this would all be lost.  For American viewers like myself, I strongly recommend turning on the Captioning.  It makes it much easier to follow, as the pace of the dialogue ranges from natural to fast banter, and with the British accents that can be difficult at times to understand.<br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to many more episodes.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book held my interest early on.  The story was well told and linked together the interesting pasts, present and future of two young people.  I liked it a lot and would definitely recommend it to others.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is cool its not like the computer yet but every month and a half they update is recently they've put armorial and signs.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is an incredible series.  This was a great ending of the season.  Love the continued suspense to have to watch this next season.
B007EECSFA|5.0|.  Suspense all the way to the very last page and compelling story line.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good read
B00AKFG15S|4.0|I really hope the history continues, since it a fantastic history, but I feel this haven´t ends yet... I´m very looking forwar to see a 4th part.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Way too addicting!  Easy way to deplete all the battery life in your device and then continue to play while your plugged in recharging!
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|It was an excellent second part, in the very style of Archer, I really enjoy it. If you have read the first part you can´t miss this one!
B009VMN3RA|2.0|Storyline went to fast from time to time.  Mentioned a boyfriend or husband then did not include them in future happenings.  I forgot she was married or in another relationship.  Really dogged Ms. MacLaine and I came away from book with a different outlook on her, but questioned Sachi's truthness.  Father figure was made out to be horrible when I think she did have a good relationship with him.  Did not like.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Have it on my main computers and it's been very good. It's kept me safe for a couple of years.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|So much funnier than I ever thought!! I have been spreading the word to everyone in my family and they have started watching also.
B001974DG0|5.0|Great book . Make  me want to run out and get a dog . Well done  Thank you looking forward to reading many more
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Ok for DVD rental! A lot of bloodshed! Jamie Foxx acting was great as was Samuel L Jackson!  Would recommend but not for women and small children !
B000FC12Z0|5.0|A real page turner!  I read this book about 30 years ago so I forgot most of the plot.  My Bookclub Group has taken up reading the classics and picked 'Murder on the Orient Express&#34;.  Agatha Christie has a flare for storytelling. If you haven't read this in a while, take the time to do so, you won't be disappointed.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I've read a lot of the Sherlock stories and novels, and I can easily say that this show is a fantastic adaption of the stories. The writing is incredible, leading the audience through all sorts of great twists and turns. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman brought their &#34;A&#34; game acting, which leads to an instant connection to all of the characters. Each show is different, and each brings thier own reply value. Great acting, great writing, and full of mind-blowing mystery; what more could one ask for in a show?
B006LSZECO|4.0|Some parts of this book are predictable but I could not guess how it was going to end. I found it entertaining and while I was reading I was able to escape from the hectic pace of life.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I bought this CD along with Time Out of Mind. I am enjoying this music style very much. He just keeps bringing them on,One of my favourite artists by far.
B003FBMS4W|5.0|&#34;The Searchers&#34; is certainly one of the finest films ever made. It is iconic and epic. Books have been written about it and it is still much discussed today. It is certainly John Wayne's finest performance just ahead of &#34;Red River&#34; and &#34;True Grit.&#34; The themes of loss and racism are powerful. Racism is not treated as a virtue. Wayne's performance as a man outside the norms of civilization will say with the viewer. This is as good as it gets.
B000002C2E|5.0|Love it. Heard Bob at Byron Bay Bluesfest,,this style for first time,just had to go and buy it.He was great.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis is at his best as Hawkeye. This is a well filmed, action filled story. The acting is terrific. Many people didn't like it, but aside from some violent content, I thought it was superb. I liked the way Hawkeye and his companions were always on the move which was a metaphor for them being people of action. I liked everything about this film.
B0057ZEMF2|5.0|Like the fusion of styles,also very gifted and creative,will be looking to get some other of Anoushkas playing.I am very fond of the Sitar.Have some of her fathers works,as well. Very talented family.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|great price on a wonderful adaptation of the book.  gave it for a gift and it was much appreciated. Thanks.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My son loves this game. It is nice because sometimes he asks for help and I get to play it too :-)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|great price on the best finish of a much loved series.  my daughter loved this series so I was happy to find a good deal.
0780626494|5.0|This Blast From the Past DVD was exactly what I was looking for.  I was very satisfied with product, service, delivery... everything! Thank you so very much for offering this for sale on Amazon!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good story line.  Acters have good chemistry with each other Violence and bloodshed kept to a minimum, and just the right amount of sex.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|The Braveheart (two-disc Special Collector's Edition) DVD was exactly what I was looking for.  I was very satisfied with product, service, delivery... everything! Thank you so very much for offering this for sale on Amazon!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I couldn't believe the price for these batteries and purchased them anyway.  They work great and have a several year expiration.  I will buy them again.
B00005MHNB|1.0|This DVD was not for a USA region; could only be played in Region 2. Could not watch it. Be careful what you buy; make sure you know which region any DVD will play in. Was money I wasted on buying this DVD. Won't do that again! :-(
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Trailers looked hilarious, and there were definitely some moments that were, but overall it was only amusing at most. Certainly not the good time I was hoping for.
0790731940|5.0|This Maverick DVD with snap case packaging was exactly what I was looking for.  I was very satisfied with product, service, delivery... everything! Thank you so very much for offering this for sale on Amazon!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I loved most of the upbeat songs and you could understand the words on the CD.  Her voices on some songs sound like Beyonce'.  But, never the less, this is a great CD.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Can spend hours playing this.  Good or bad I don't know!!  Way fun and easy way to pass some time when waiting.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My 15 year old son likes this one. My husband has been playing it too. It seems fun eating the fish...but I don't like when they get the swimmers
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A good read about how family will be there for you no matter how hard life gets. Sometimes pain is just too hard to bare alone.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A beautifully written book, sad but redemptive and very peaceful. Written at walking pace, read it yourself to find how apt this is. A lovely gift to give, to yourself or someone special.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|It took me a while to settle into this movie...it seemed a little disturbing at first but as I began to understand the character of the little boy, the story became more absorbing...when it ended I thought...this was a good movie.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|A breath of fresh air, a science fiction book that tackles some interesting questions about the worth of a human life.The book takes place in the twenty fifth century, the author has taken some liberations in terms of his vision for the future and the technology that excists there. Written in a very mature, action packed and thrilling way, this is one of the best and most entertaining novels I have read.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much...good for family...shows how hearts can be touched by situations involving other creatures of God's creation...just heartwarming!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|The best fantay book i`ve ever read, and that includes LoTR, Wheel of Time among other.So many great characters, some grown up, meaningful content and interesting events.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Movie was great, especially after that trash quantum of solace. I think it was too long for my uninterested wife but if you like bond you cant go wrong.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I read this book in under 24 hours. It was engaging, intelligent and a real affirmation for me. Ms. Sandberg clearly anticipated her nay-sayers and cut them off right in the beginning. I felt empowered and enlightened after reading it and my husband is even reading it now!
B007SGM084|5.0|This I  by far best and  most original series like this.  I've read it 3 times now and it's just a  good as th e time!  I hope EL James writes another one
B007N5YIUS|3.0|It's okay, not the thrill of the first Angry Birds which really made me addicted.  Maybe I'll get used to it.
0486278077|4.0|Truly, as Dorian tells us, \\"the soul is a terrible reality.\\"  The Picture of Dorian Gray is really the picture of a man's soul.  No matter how far we attempt to hide it away, no matter what lies we tell, no matter if we kill its maker, the soul still lives on and shows us what we have made of ourselves.  We go on chasing after our own pleasures and using and abusing the great gifts of youth and possessions, but our soul goes on becoming darker and older.  Have you ever felt like Dorian, rushing back home to make sure someone or another doesn't see what's really there?  But what fascinates me is the end.  It is not when the maker catches a glimpse of the painting, it is not when his past hunts him down, but it is when he actually tries to live a good life to cover up the darkness of his soul.  It is that moment when he looks upon his soul that his life comes to an end.  He sees the hypocrisy of his actions, the blood on his hands only gets bigger, and moves to kill his own soul.  The problem today is that, in the words of Dorian, \\"we have given up our belief in the soul.\\"  We, like Dorian, have sold our souls so that we may live our lives without thought of something bigger, something beyond mere physicality.  We find that our good deeds only serve to stir the soul into a stronger and stronger rage.  But is there hope?  If we're all Dorians, shouldn't we all just plunge the knife into our own hearts?  Perhaps there was something that Dorian missed.  If the painter could make us each such a masterpiece that it could bear our sins and scars, doesn't it stand that the painter could offer another masterpiece that could perhaps take away the sins and scars of our own portrait?  Just as the painting of our soul is riddled and bloodstained with wickedness, we need another painting - another soul who can take our place, riddled and bloodstained with wickedness alien to the one in the portrait.  We who hide from this terrible reality desperately need another portrait.
