It reflects the recent changes pertaining to accounts rules (as at August 2009) that have come into force since the publication of the 2006 edition - and there is a fairly long list of these, including amendments to the Solicitors' Accounts Rules 1998 which culminated in significant changes implemented on 31 March 2009 following the partial implementation of the Legal Services Act 2007.  So it was by June 2007 that the general conduct obligations were codified in the Solicitors' Code of Conduct 2007.<br /><br />Usefully - in case you're not terribly confident of prior knowledge in this area -- the book's first chapter offers you an overview of the contents of the Solicitors' Accounts Rules 1998, so you don't necessarily have to look up other sources.  Or if you feel comfortable with your expertise, you can skip this chapter and read the chapters following, which give you the necessary detail on what and what is not permissible in the handling and retention of clients' money.<br /><br />As straightforward and accessible as Professor Camp's other Law Society publications, 'Solicitors and the Accounts Rules' illustrates with practical examples some of the complexities you will typically encounter within this area of your practice.  In particular, note Chapter 13 which offers practical guidance on the application of the rules in specific circumstances.  Also worthy of note: the chapter on money laundering which has been updated to reflect the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, brought into force in December 2007.<br /><br />With key texts and legislation included in the appendices, plus useful Table of Cases and Table of Statutes, Table of Law Society rules and codes, Table of statutory instruments, `Solicitors and The Accounts Rule's is invaluable as a work of reference, particularly if you as a solicitor are involved with the day to day handling of client monies and solicitors' accounts.<br /><br />The work has 14 chapters in 300 pages with two detailed and important appendices, and readers will find sister works from the Law Society available to cover areas such recent areas as money laundering as the issue of solicitors and their accounts rules remains a practice priority and the advice given by Peter Camp remains impeccable.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-85328-799-2atutes, Table of Law Society rules and codes, Table of statutory instruments, `Solicitors and The Accounts Rule's is invaluable as a work of reference, particularly if you as a solicitor are involved with the day to day handling of client monies and solicitors' accounts.

B000P12LWY|5.0|\\"The Tudors\\" is unlike any television show ever broadcast. The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget, the acting is worthy of Oscars, and the story, although told before, is presented here fresh and is excitingly original. This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him. The first season details the King's attempts to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and his lust for Anne Boleyn. The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes, but what makes \\"The Tudors\\" work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads, most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator, but a man who loves his country and his people. The series won many Emmy nominations, most notably one for Meyers, for his soaring portrayal. \\"The Tudors\\" is beautifully produced, with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series. In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD (season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010).

They are admired for their rigorously high standards of thorough research, as well as for their plain speaking, practicality, ease of use and, importantly, the sense of compassion that lies at their heart which we rely heavily on as professional when giving advice.<br /><br />So, `Support for Asylum Seekers and Other Migrants' continues in this vein in this 3rd edition which, as the LAG notes, is `the only handbook that focuses exclusively on the welfare and legal rights of asylum seekers'.  Additionally, the third edition has been expanded to cover the welfare needs of other migrants, `in particular refused asylum seekers at the end of the process and EU nationals'.<br /><br />The authors view with dismay, if not alarm, the current situation in which asylum seekers typically find themselves, observing that little has changed since publication of the last edition of the handbook in 2004.  Alison Harvey, General Secretary of the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association refers in the foreword to `the combination of poor administration and punitive policies that view destitution as a means of immigration control that have long dogged this area of law'.  `Muddle and misery', she says, quoting Helen Bamber's preface to the first edition of the Handbook in 2002, `will do just as well to describe the situation in 2009'.<br /><br />All the more reason, imply the authors, for asylum seekers -- vulnerable and desperate as they usually are - to be able to access representation and advice from advocates possessing a sound understanding of applicable national and international law.  In this extremely vexed area of advocacy, legal representatives must be able to grasp and utilize expertise not just across immigration, but across other areas of law, particularly welfare benefits, community care and housing; all  against a backdrop of a frequently changing legal aid system.<br /><br />This handbook, which has extended its scope to include other migrants - including those whose claims for asylum have failed but who cannot be returned to their country - is of immense help to the practitioner who needs to navigate the troubled waters of immigration.<br /><br />Therefore, if you're an advocate or adviser involved with, or specializing in immigration law, make sure you add this invaluable handbook to your professional library, especially in view of the relevant provisions of the Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, anticipated for July 2011. The contents of the Handbook reflect the law as at August 2009 and put this emotive subject very much in focus.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-903307-72-4se not just across immigration, but across other areas of law, particularly welfare benefits, community care and housing; all  against a backdrop of a frequently changing legal aid system.

B000W4HIX6|5.0|I've seen this movie now in the theater, VHS, DVD and now on blu-ray. I can say for sure that the Blu-Ray version is the best version around. Anyone that tries to say that this version wasn't encoded up to blu-ray standards and is basically the same quality as dvd is full of it. Sure there are some scenes that are blurry - they were blurry when the movie was filmed guys, blu-ray isn't going to clear that up. What it did do was really bring to life the rest of the movie that was shot in focus. There are a select few scenes where the color is off-balanced as well. The other 98% of the movie is done fantastically well. I for one am glad that i took the chance on it. Trust me, it's a clear upgrade on an HDTV from the DVD version.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Some people who are less familiar with Lady GaGa will consider this a re-issue or a clever way to keep cashing in on The Fame album.  But take a few minutes to listen to the new songs released on this album.    Right before The Fame Monster officially debuted, a now famously-known YouTube video of a pre-Lady GaGa was posted on the web.  She was plain looking with her natural long brown hair and playing the piano bare footed.  People were stunned to see that this lady, Lady GaGa, could actually perform classical music.  Then some bemoaned the fact she'd become a pop music star.  What these people could not understand is that Lady GaGa does show these strengths on at least one of her new songs--Speechless, a ballad which she purportedly wrote about her father and mother's relationship.  She has not lost these talents, and has her eyes on changing the idea of pop music being a low brow genre.      Bad Romance, GaGa's first single from this album, has the interesting phrase \\"I'm a free bitch.\\"  As a woman I find this incredibly impowering.  She is a free agent, not told what to do.  She is a free woman, she bows down to no man.  And several of the new songs display a form of feminism that will connect to women of any age.  Dance in the Dark is about women who are told to act properly in a man's world.    GaGa has been compared to Madonna for innovation, and she shows hints of Xtina in her singing voice. While her performances continue to be stunners and her music keeps you on the dance floor while having a real message to it, I think she only has further to go with it.  I expect her only to evolve more just as Madonna did and grow as a musician throughout the years.  She's not going anywhere, little monsters.
141041986X|4.0|I am strangely attracted to stories about people who struggle and are humble, barely eking out an existence. I'm especially touched when there is sacrifice and bravery from people helping other people, sometimes in silence not expecting any kind of recognition for their good deeds. I enjoy no nonsense, non Hollywood/LA girls who get out there and quietly kick ass. These are some of the themes in this little science fiction beauty and there are some real tear jerking and touching moments. Society has become the worst we can imagine with the rich sitting back and creating games (it may remind you of the way the Romans were when they watched lions eat people) all for their own entertainment and in a way to control the masses and keep them in their lugubrious places.<br /><br />I loved our main character, Katniss. Sometimes, I felt I was in her shoes, sometimes she was my daughter that I wanted to protect, and sometimes she was the one protecting me. She is a very honest, talented, and special. She may have it in her to be the reluctant leader of the movement that will change the screwed up world she lives in.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next book.
0385504225|5.0|Wow. Dan Brown just keeps getting better. There were a couple of times I was absolutely shocked with what he had written. I couldn't imagine where he would go next, but he pulled it off brilliantly.    What I especially liked about this book was the fact it was based in D.C. So when I visit there I can actually go see some of the artwork and statuary he was refereing to. Although the Da Vinci code was great, I don't expect to ever get to those landmarks in France that he talked about.    The background on the Mason's was fascinating too. Don't know how accurate his explanations are, but I'll bet the basics are pretty close, although I imagine the biggest secrets are not quite as he explained it.    Great read though. I sure enjoyed it.
0307341569|4.0|After reading some of the other more critical reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect of this book. With such a mean, unlikable central character as Libby Day, how could I care about her?<br />Of course you don't have to \\"like\\" a character real or unreal to find them interesting. I found Libby interesting and I found I cared about her. She most certainly has a heart and it peeks out now and then in spite of herself. I liked her.<br />The story itself is woven of the fabric of the past and present as it flashes back and forth between the two. It is also seen through the eyes of Libby as well as other characters and you see how each interprets and acts upon a situation.<br />A family is torn apart by poverty, depression, then murder. A mother and two children are slain. One child runs from the home and escapes.  The fourth child is convicted of murder and sent to prison, an obligatory confession and the testimony of the seven-year-old survivor carrying more weight than the lack of evidence.<br /><br />But did the seven-year-old actually see what happened? Did she see her fifteen-year-old black sheep brother Ben kill her mother and sisters? That seven-year-old was Libby Day.<br />The present sees Libby as an adult, depressed, living off the money sent by charity/well-wishers to her as a lone child surviver of crime. She's never worked, commits petty theft, is admittedly mean-spirited, and has squandered her money.<br />When a group of true-crime buffs contact her to talk about the famous Day Murders as well as discuss the possibility that her heavy metal, Satanist brother may not have acted alone (or at all) in the killings, her interest is piqued not so much by curiosity as the fact they'll pay her for info. Problem is, there isn't much info about the details as no one knows what actually happened.<br />The more contacts with people from her forgotten past she makes, the more money she gets. What she believes will be an easy quick buck turns into a convoluted journey and brings her face to face with characters she never imagined she'd see again...for the good and bad. She learns secrets that come back to haunt her and perhaps kill her. Secrets from dark places.<br />This book has some great, unexpected twists and a shock ending.<br />Some other reviewers have called the ending implausable. I found it improbable but not impossible as a whole.<br />A maddening detail for me was the fact that the occurances within the household that murderous night would have been loud enough (as described) to alert others and therefor it would be difficult for certain events to take place at the same time. If these events would have occured in a quieter manner (with the same type of outcome) they could have all happened that same night. Or if the events were timed just a bit off...<br /><br />Still, I liked the book. Far more than I was expecting.<br />What really happened that night a family was murdered?

B000V4UFZK|5.0|Just wanted to upgrade from VHS to DVD.  The movie was filmed on our street and its cool to see our house a few months new.  Steven Spielberg was interesting to watch.  At one point he sat in his director chair, in the street (filming was up and down the street) and the kids gathered around.  He really tuned into the kids.  He asked our son who his favorite director was.  Without missing a beat, our son said, \\"George Lucas\\".  Spielberg laughed aloud.  Of course, it was always all about Star Wars from the moment he saw that film.  An Army veteran, it still is!
B0026P3G12|1.0|Ms. Boyle does quite nicely, but this album lacks the zest for life that she had on the show.  I hope she can show that in her next album because she IS an amazing lady.
B0026P3G12|1.0|I love Susan's voice and I was so anxious for this to be amazing.  I am saddened (but not surprised) to think that her moment in time has been exploited and that her advisors have done nothing but capitalize on her current popularity and marketability. It is a mind numbing bore.  They have cost her her one best opportunity to prove herself more than a one hit wonder. She should have done more Webber or better yet, Sondheim, type songs in order to demonstrate the beautiful dramatic quality of her voice. She needs new representation or at the very least better advice on song selection.  I was disappointed and  had trouble listening to the entire album.  Loved Wild Horses.  I Dreamed a Dream was not her powerful rendition but a thin, watered down version. I truly do not need to hear one more beautiful voice sing Amazing Grace, How Great Thou Art or even Silent Night.  They have been done ad nauseum   I probably will never play this album through again and I will not buy the next one \\"sight unheard.\\" It is a shame.
0515123447|4.0|I read KILLING FLOOR years ago and really couldn't remember it so I went at it again.  Child's hero Jack Reacher is probably too good to be true but Childs keep it interesting.  Former military policeman Reacher walks into a small Georgia town and is arrested for murder.  He gets out of hot water and actually leads the investigation.  The book is far from the best I have read but it is good enough to read the next one and maybe more.
B002X20W2E|5.0|I was waiting for this album ever since her \\"dissapearance\\" and her last album was so good so I really thought there was no way she could follow this up....wow let's just say this is not like \\"A Girl Like Me\\" this is definitely a much darker side of Rihanna...she talks about her problems with love (probably Chris Brown?) her stupidity...how she's a rockstar....she's cursing all over this one (at least for her bubbly standards) I am just very impressed....apart from the 2 singles...the other great tracks are....Hard, Stupid In Love, Rockstar 101, Rude Boy and Photographs...the whole album is actually very good...much different side and of course I expected Amazon to have this for $3.99 and OF COURSE they do! Gotta Love Amazon MP3....giving iTunes a run for it's money
B000PATZQK|5.0|'Odessey and Oracle' is becoming one of my favorite albums. The audio quality of the album very much surprised me. I have come across this clarity only few times in my audiophile life: once, when I listened to Tom Petty's 'Full Moon Fever' and another time when I played The Beach Boy's 'Pet Sounds' remastered album. I can't explain how they make it sound so incredible (I'd love to read a book about the recording sessions of some of these bands) but I am happy that it sounds the way it does.<br /><br />This album mixes the 'Beatles' style of psychedelia with the harmony style of 'the Beach Boys'...all while creating a great set of lyrics for each individual song.<br /><br />I'd list my favorites, but each song has its own perfection. The mp3 album cost, as of now (11/23/09), is $5.00...very much worth the price of this excellent album which defines 'The Zombies'.<br /><br />5/5
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Portishead would like to apologize to their fans for not producing \\"Dummy 2\\" or \\"Portishead 3\\". Upon reading the 1-star reviews of the angry fans, they have realized their mistake and went back to the studio to record a new album with the same stuff they were doing 10 years ago... Wait, what?! Are you kidding me? If you want something that sounds like their previous albums there is a very simple solution: listen to the previous albums! Musicians evolve and try to create music that they feel is meaningful. Sometimes experimentation works, other times it does not. But for Portishead it has sure done wonders.    I love their first two albums just as much as anyone else. That does not mean though that I have a \\"Dummy\\" ruler with which I check if the new album fits the standards. It doesn't, and that's wonderful. The trip-hop is still there, the melancholy is plenty, but the band has also added new stuff to the mix: some alternative atmosphere (no wonder Radiohead did a cover of \\"The Rip\\"), some psychedelic undertones (the second half of \\"Small\\", reminiscent of early Pink Floyd), some powerful electronic beats (the mighty \\"Machine Gun\\", or the menacing \\"We Carry On\\"). They're changing dynamics inside the songs and on the album as a whole (just think of the odd pairing of the soothing \\"Deep Water\\" and the disturbing \\"Machine Gun\\") while at the same time providing a wonderful counterbalance with Beth's eerie voice.    There is a very smooth transition from the first to the last tracks. The first half of the album is a powerful reminder of why we love Portishead in the first place. The second half is a sign of things to come, and why some of us will still love Portishead even if they might sound nothing like in the beginning. Give it some time, come back to it later. It might just not be your album, but there's also a chance that it will start growing on you and then the reward will be tremendous. One morning you'll wake up hooked to the beat of Machine Gun and that will pretty much be it.
B000SINT52|1.0|Over the course of my many years on this earth, I have voted for more Republican candidates for president than Democrats.  In the last four elections, however, my votes went to:  Nader (twice), Kerry and then Obama.  It's hard for me to imagine that history will not come to judge George W. Bush as our worst president ever.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I doubt that there have been many worse documentary film makers than Michael Moore.  To cite just one example from \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" there is a short clip  where Bush appears to be standing in the midst of a bunch of  fat cats, talking about his \\"base\\" (i.e., the \\"haves and have-mores\\"); this clip was plucked, misleadingly, from a massive fundraising event/dinner put on by the Catholic Church in which both presidential candidates (Bush and Gore) were in attendance, and at which both poked a little fun at themselves for the purpose of giving these donors to Catholic charities a few very good laughs.  Moore's film cut made it look like Bush was SERIOUSLY pandering to this group.  He did this throughout the \\"Fahrenheit\\" mockumentary, and I would recommend that you watch the rebuttal-film, \\"FahrenHYPE 9/11,\\" to see just how extensively Moore's \\"end justifies the means\\" philosophy makes an absolute travesty of documentary filmmaking.<br /><br />\\"FahrenHYPE\\" was hastily put together in only four months after Moore's picture came out, and it has its own over-the-top right wing political ax to grind, but it's quite straightforward with its message, and it doesn't use gimmickry and duplicity to push its pro (2004 pre-election) Iraq war agenda.  If, however, you can get beyond having to watch some clips of the shrill Ann Coulter, and a few others, the film's real value--amounting to well over half its 80 minute length--consists in pointing out the many spliced, diced, and edited fabrications and distortions (lies, really) that Moore used to go after a president who so sorely lacked the intellectual heft, the ecumenical breadth, and the moral gravitas for the job., and the moral gravitas for the job.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Absolutely one of the best, most informative mini-series I have seen.  It covered much of the verifiable facts without using alot of todays's revisionist/PC jargon.  Many have little information on Adams, and this series covers quite a bit of ground from all angles; again - job well done.    I would highly recommend this for factual history lessons/classes in school, and also for avid history buffs.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's rise to fame has been a store that she and us will never forget.    Her frumpy appearance caused snickers among the audience but she won them over when she sang when the first few notes of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" left her mouth in an angelic tone.  Her CD is a blessing to her and to her fans. You Rock, SUSAN :XD
0316154687|5.0|I read somewhere that this was a good book to read if you are just starting off with Sedaris. I don't know if that is true, since I have never read any other Sedaris books other than this. But I will say that now that I read this one, I want to read them all. I read a lot of reviews saying that this book was hilarious. It was not hilarious - not all of it. There were a lot of parts that are very funny for their honesty; and others that are funny but not in that 'HAHA' way. Mostly I was just charmed by Sedaris' writing style and stories. No matter how strange the situations are - and believe me, some of them are really strange - he finds a way to make them relate-able.
0688101364|5.0|Anyone can tell which cookbooks I love most just by looking at my cookbook shelves. Broken spines and cockeyed pages peeking out in every direction clearly show which ones I prefer to spend time with in the kitchen. This is definitely one of them. Almost every page is stained and dog-eared, and one recipe in here (David's Dreambars) has become so much of a Christmas tradition that I'd probably be drummed out of the family if I neglected to make it. With good reason, too, because it's not only incredibly delicious and decadent, it's also ridiculously easy to make.    Actually, this book has recipes for just about every taste and skill level. The only one I've been disappointed with is \\"Mrs. King's Irresistibles,\\" and that's mostly because the recipe doesn't call for any salt. It may have been a simple editing error, but these cookies NEED salt or they turn out bland and virtually tasteless.    If you love making cookies (and eating them) during the holidays or at any other time, you need this book!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|A delightfully funny and heart warming romantic comedy (with emphasis on comedy) which was the first time I saw Ron Livingston acting; he plays Peter Gibbons. He is extremely funny as a somewhat pathetic and alienated office worker (computer programmer) who is used and abused by the computer software company he works for as is his two friends.    After a botches hypnosis session that is supposed to make Peter content with his life as a computer programmer but instead emboldens him to live his life completely disregarding any consequences regarding his work (like fishing instead of working, sleeping in until 11:00 am then showing up for work for a few hours and then leaving), \\"consultants\\" advise him that his two buddies, fellow programmers Michael Botton (David Herman) and Samir (Ajay Naidu), two of the best programmers and most senior employees will be fired to save money by outsourcing their programming to India. Peter convinces his two friends help him defraud the company they work for at the rate of few pennies a day using a computer virus designed by David so that after several years they will have a tidy nest egg in savings.    Peter, thanks to the hypnosis session, finds the boldness he previously lacked and begins dating Joanna (Jennifer Aniston); quickly they fall in love. Unfortunately, his romance is interrupted when he checks how Michael's virus is working. In one day, the computer program that should have collected a couple pennies collects over a $100,000.    Faced with certain discovery, Peter's friendship with Samir and Michael as well as his romance with Joanna are shattered, and Peter plans to turn himself in while taking all the blame for the crime so that his friends will remain free.    While on the way to the police and jail, Peter notices a fire (set by a different disgruntled employee) that burns down the computer company he works for, thus destroying all the incriminating accounting documents that might trace him to the crime; BTW, the moneyis also destroyed by the fire.    This intended act of self-sacrifice regains the friendship of Samir and Michael, as well as the respect of Joanna. Thus, Peter is saved from jail, is reunited with his love, and regains the friendship of his two closest friends.    This rather low budget film I found tastefully funny, relevant to contemporary feelings of alienation and hostility to companies out to make money at the expense of exploiting employees, and full of well written script and interesting and original plot.    I heartily recommend it to film fans of comedy and/or romantic comedy.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|I just watched Black Eyed Peas's performance of \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" on the X Factor show in UK, and I must say I was absolutely hooked to this song, wonderful vocals from Fergie. I love the fact that they are evolving and trying something new. I also heard \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" and \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" on several occasions while driving with friends and I was quite impressed. In addition, I'm a clubber so when I heard these two songs, I just can't stop dancing! It must be those tequila shots!! I was really mesmerized of Black Eyed Peas's performance in 2009 Isle of Malta to \\"Meet Me Halfway\\", it absolutely won me over. I told myself I got to buy this album right away and now I have it!! Highly Recommended!!

B002X063OC|5.0|Lady Gaga fans rejoice! Not just celebrating new material but the fact that it can be purchased separately from The Fame. The 8 songs that come on The Fame Monster are in the same vein, though you won't hear constant references to money and fame (which is a plus). The first three songs of the album (Bad Romance, Alejandro, Monster) will immediately have you hooked, while the remainder of the album is either love it or hate it. Speechless breaks away from the pattern and is a great slower Gaga song, Telephone is also excellent. While Dance in the Dark and So Happy I Could Die are also good, but they feel too familiar to really stand out. Finally Teeth is a great finish to this short album. Ultimately if you are a Gaga fan as I am, you will have the album on repeat, there is no slump as I feared there would be. Lesser fans will want to stick with the first three songs primarily.     Best Songs: Bad Romance, Monster, Alejandro, Telephone

B002X20W2E|4.0|Rihanna's latest album finds herself again wandering into a slightly different style of music and emotion. While no doubt some of the songs on the album are a bit angrier and edgier, her music hasn't really depreciated greatly. It is great to see her take new directions in her music and not leave us with the same stale stuff. That said, you can't blame a girl for saying how she feels and I applaud it. Those who can't handle Rihanna's anger and are offended by a few curse words here and there should stick to listening to the radio friendly singles (try Photographs and Russian Roulette) and skip the rest of the album this time around.    Best tracks: Hard, Wait Your Turn, Russian Roulette, Rude Boy, Photographs

The story really begins to heat up when the two main researchers/writers of this explosive expose are found murdered in their apartment and Lisbeth Salander's fingerprints are on the gun.  Bloomkvist stands alone in his belief that Salander is innocent (Even though she has been missing for a year or so).  Bloomkvist may know Salander better than anyone at this point because of their brief tryst during the first book and Bloomkvist's continued attempts to at least remain her friend.  For that reason, I have really grown to like Lisbeth Salander and I will continue to root for her.  This book took me a long time to read and I have to admit that I skimmed some of it because the book rambled on and on at times.  I was anxious to get back to Lisbeth's story.  I'm glad that in this book we find out more about her, what drives her.<br /><br />I look forward to the third book.  I'm sad that it will be the last one.
B002XSP16A|5.0|I dreamed a dream that Susan Boyle would be where she is today! She is truly Original and very unique to this style of Music.Her voice pure and up lifting to all who are so lucky to able to hear her in the distance.I think she has a huge future awaiting her and she has made the impossible,possible! She will only get better and better as she blooms into a beautiful rose.
B0026P3G12|5.0|We bought \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" mostly because we heard the amazingly talented Susan Boyle sing the title song on numerous TV and Internet showings, but this album is worth having on it's own merits, not just because of the notoriety (what a fantastic story!) of the artist! Susan's voice is fresh and powerful, and she sings beautiful renditions of all of the songs 12 songs included on this CD. We also really loved her version of \\"Wild Horses\\", which is very powerful!<br /><br />This is a collection of both secular and religious songs (\\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" are truly moving works), and you can hear a sample of each track on the Amazon product page to determine if her version of the song is to your liking. We will be giving several of these albums as gifts this year since almost everyone knows about Susan's story and has heard her fantastic voice.<br /><br />This is a classic case of `Never judge a book by its cover' - Highly Recommended!
B002X20W2E|2.0|Gee, thanks R., for perpetuating dreck, you know, what passes for art these days.  Teenagers all over the world need more advice on how to raise their middle fingers with a \\"f- you\\" attitude.  Hey, I get it; I can swear like a sailor at times, but do we really need to curse in every frickin' song?  Ya, ya, ya, the album's called \\"Rated R.\\"  But next time, focus on melodies instead of showing what a \\"tough\\" girl you are.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I see more than a few comparisons between \\"Battle Studies\\" and \\"Continuum\\", as if everyone should expect an artist to re-hash the same great album over and over. This album is a different album and shouldn't be judged based on the last one. I can say that this is the first John Mayer album that I like the first time that I heard it. I appreciate anyone that willing to take risk, and not fall back on the same each and everytime.
B0026P3G12|1.0|Well, here's a refreshing change. This being an American site, your humble narrator usually has to explain who these creatures that have emerged from the British reality swamp actually are. Most drones from the likes of X Factor and Britain's Got Talent are people you have quite rightly never heard of, so the first paragraph of these reviews are usually an explanation of why their empty, dead eyes are staring back at you on the cover of a CD.<br /><br />But, of course, you already know who Susan Boyle is. Thanks to her performance on Britain's Got Talent, her weird, squashed face was on every newspaper, magazine, internet site and milk carton (alas, that part isn't true), not only in the UK - but seemingly the entire world. She was on talk shows. She was on the news - she was everywhere. So what exactly did she do that stopped the world spinning and the sun shining?<br /><br />She sang. On a talent show. And that was it. Yet for all the unbelievably stupid, obscene amount of fuss being made, for all the ludicrous soundbites from oily slimeballs like Piers Morgan and every cretinous \\"OMG she haz da voice of an angil\\" comment on Youtube (arguably the biggest asset in Boyle's rise to fame), her performance wasn't really THAT great. Surprising, perhaps, but the way people were banging on about it you'd think her kneecaps started singing while she flew around the air farting marshmallows. All it came down to was the fact that she had a nice voice - let's make this clear, not an AMAZING voice - and the fact she looks like Popeye in a dress.<br /><br />And THAT is the only reason she is famous. If she had walked on stage looking like, say, the smoking hot opera singer Katherine Jenkins no-one would have cared. If she had been beautiful and performed the way she had she would have made it through to the next round, certainly, but there would barely be one column written about her in the newspapers. The fact she looked, acted (and probably smelled) like the sad, deranged grannies you get stuck next to on the bus was the ONLY reason people sat up and noticed her.<br /><br />But, anyway, we could talk about how this comments on our looks-dominated culture and how shallow the people who suddenly love this woman for the simple fact she can sing well. We could talk about that creepy way Boyle stands and nods her head when people talk to her, like she's either slowly absorbing the information or wondering what they'd look like with their flesh peeled off, but hey - it's an Amazon review about her ALBUM, right? Let's talk about that.<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />Seems there's not an awful lot to talk about really. A few tedious new songs about her new life and how her Dream Came True(tm), including a song lifted from High School Musical carbon copy and big time super flop Britannia High, a TV show I'm SURE Boyle just adored. She also covers Madonna's You'll See, ruining it in the process, and sucks every bit of life and energy from Daydream Believer. And to every brainwashed simpleton bleating on about how good her version of Wild Horses is - go listen to the REAL version by the Rolling Stones. I know it's an actual band who actually wrote it for an actual album which is an alien concept to most of you, but THAT is how that song should sound; raw, emotional, REAL. Not Boyle's stuffed, overblown wail.<br /><br />This album will, and indeed already has, sold millions of copies, as every dribbling simpleton gets eaten up by the hype of a decent singer in a Mrs Potato Head shaped body. It means nothing, of course. Susan Boyle has not got the voice of an angel, she's not the second coming and this is not a record that anyone who actually appreciates music will own. It's perfect fodder for the buy one album a year brigade, perfect for baffled grannies and stupid people in general, who accept albums of cover versions as real music. They're to be pitied more than laughed at. But feel free to do both.<br /><br />It's a depressing state of affairs that awoman's general unattractiveness coupled with a decent voice can equal a million record sales, but that is the world in which we now live in. For anyone wanting genuine - and let me stress that word - passion, heart, soul and attitude, Susan Boyle, and all the other bland inoffensive puppets played by Simon Cowell, shouldn't even be an option.equal a million record sales, but that is the world in which we now live in.

006097625X|5.0|Comic books have always struggled with their role as art. At worst, they've been called subversive, destructive trash (see the Seduction of the Innocent fracas), but at best, they've won the Pulitzer (see Maus). But their main problem has always lain somewhere in the middle: with the overwhelming majority of people (at least in North America) who simply see them as \\"subliterature\\" (meaning not significant enough for truly intelligent readers), overly juvenile, or even detrimental to education.    Comics creators and readers have been battling these negative perceptions for decades, and finally, or at least it so appears, there have been major, incredible breakthroughs in the past several years. And with so many new readers flooding into the marketplace, there comes a need for a greater understanding of what comics are, what they do, and what they can be. Scott McCloud understood that need and saw it coming more than a decade and a half ago, and he catalogued it in Understanding Comics.    McCloud is perhaps still best known for his groundbreaking work on Zot! But when he took on the comics format and deconstructed it, dissected it, and labeled its essential components, he furthered the comics initiative even more--because he gave the format a basis for discussion and analysis that was previously left unmentioned.    Understanding Comics breaks down the comics format to its panel essentials and allows readers to see why the format works so well for telling stories (all kinds of stories). What McCloud doesn't do, thankfully, is preach or talk down to the reader. Instead, he uses the joys of comics reading to teach the joys of comics reading, elevating the format to level it deserves to be studied and talked about on.     There's a reason Understanding Comics has been an industry staple since its first publication in 1993: It gets it, and helps everyone else get it, in a way that gave fans an \\"A-ha!\\" moment but also gave nonreaders, or new readers, a chance to jump onboard the train. By the time he walks through the complete language and form of comics (and he's incredibly thorough, covering discussion and thought balloons, the ways panels work, the roles of lines and artwork, color and black and white, and the evolution of time in the pages of comics), he's completed a short master class in the format. If comics is the language we all speak, McCloud has provided the essential dictionary.    -- John Hogan

0060825456|5.0|Coraline is the story that keeps on giving. First presented as a novel by Neil Gaiman, then made into a fantastic film, even turned into a Broadway play, it's also now a graphic novel. You would think a story would suffer from being reinterpreted so many times, but it doesn't. It's still wonderfully exotic, fun, creepy, and just a little bit subversive. Perfect for kids and adults.     Coraline has been adapted by P. Craig Russell, a fantastic comics artist who has a nice style all his own. His Coraline is older than the movie version and not as seemingly innocent, but essentially the story is the same: Young Coraline and her parents move into a gigantic old house that has an apartment above and below. Above lives an old man who claims to run a mouse circus; below, two sisters relive their glory days as actresses. In the middle, Coraline explores the house and tries to uncover its secrets while her parents busy themselves with work.     A door leads her to a mirror realm where alternate versions of everyone in the house live, including her mother, who is just as sweet, charming, and attentive as any child could ask for. The only difference is the huge button eyes they all have, a small difference that in truth marks the real danger Coraline is in.     It turns out there's almost no version of Coraline that doesn't win over its audience. The story works perfectly as a graphic novel, perhaps because Russell is such a broad talent.     On a side note, it's so nice to see Coraline presented with third-person narration and actual thought bubbles. It's been so long since I've seen them in a comic, I almost forgot what they were. It turns out it is possible to present a great story using these longtime comics staples.    -- John Hogan

140120841X|5.0|While Alan Moore remains best known for his work on the influential comic series/graphic novel Watchmen, the 1980s were an incredibly productive time for the subversive writer. Among a slew of successes came what is arguably Moore's second biggest work, V for Vendetta.     The three-part story follows the actions of a person known only as \\"V,\\" who dons a Guy Fawkes mask as he preaches anarchism and carries out a one-man war with a totalitarian government in what was then considered the \\"near future,\\" the 1990s. But like most stories that deal with the \\"not-too-distant future,\\" V for Vendetta has much in common with current situations in the world, and as much has arguably stayed the same, the story remains relevant today.     V first appears as a Batman-like character, emerging masked from the shadows, striking fear in the enemy as he rescues a young girl, Evey Hammond, from corrupt cops who plan to rape and kill her. That's about as far as comparisons to the Bat go. V speaks as though raised on Shakespeare and proudly proclaims responsibility as the Houses of Parliament explode and fireworks light the sky. He apparently has no qualms about killing and destroying.     As the story unfolds, we learn more about V's background, as Evey learns more about the ideals of the masked man. V isn't through after the Houses of Parliament. There is a bigger plan, and the powers are scrambling to do everything they can to keep the propaganda rolling and bandage the damage V is doing to their ideals.     At its core, V for Vendetta advocates terrorism, or at least presents someone referred to as a terrorist as a protagonist of the story. He kills, bombs, and brainwashes in the name of his ideals. But that is what Moore challenges throughout. Is terrorism in the face of oppression \\"terrorism,\\" in the negative sense, or is it patriotism if carried out in the name of a wakeup call to bring things back to the people?     There is an important battle brewing throughout the story involving \\"Fate\\" and \\"Justice.\\" V for Vendetta is a book about ideals. This terrorist is someone who, literally in this sense, has been imprisoned, experimented upon, and tortured by his government. He wants freedom, not only for himself--he already has a slice of that in his subway dwelling--but for everyone. And he's fighting for it, breaking down the walls to give others the opportunity to do the same. He is like the protagonist of 1984, but he's willing to blow things up to change the world rather than run until he eventually gets a metaphorical bullet to the head.     The art of David Lloyd is unique, to say the least. The images strike a realistic tone but are often shaded in white, blue, and sometimes yellow tones that seem to deprive the panels of some detail. It is a style that may not work for many readers.     But at the core of things, V for Vendetta is about the ideas it presents. In a three-book arc, Moore creates a cinematic story that entertains and, more importantly, will leave readers questioning their ideals for years after the last chapter is read. It is another fantastic entry into the world of subversive comics by the industry's best.    -- William Jones

B002HD427A|4.0|I was introduced to Diana Krall's music through a friend, and have been a fan since.  Not being a HUGE jazz fan though, I tend to really enjoy her albums full of covers; \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" and \\"The Look Of Love\\" being two of my favorites.  So this album falls into that category.  It's very subdued and quiet which is very relaxing.  I enjoy this album very much.  As an added bonus, I have found that her music is perfect for putting kids and babies to sleep in the car!
B002MRROKS|4.0|Watching Nirvana: Live At Reading is both awesome and sad at the same time.  Awesome because the performance rocks.  Sad because the show is so good it reminds us what a terrible loss it was when Kurt left us. It also reminds us how much better they were than all the bands who came after them in the 90's.  They still stand high above all other 90's rock bands.    As for the show, the set-list is nice and broad, not just covering Nevermind, but also hitting good parts of Bleach, Incesticide, and even In Utero, despite the fact it had not been released when the concert was performed.  In fact, one thing this show does for me is to give me a new appreciation for Bleach.  I've always overlooked it in the shadow of Nevermind, but the Bleach cuts here do themselves justice against the rest.  In fact, I would say the blistering \\"School\\" and \\"Negative Creep\\" are highlights of the show and are better suited for Nirvana's 'loose' performances than their more melodic counterparts from Nevermind.  The covers of 'The Money Will Roll Right In' and 'D7' fit nicely into the encore as respectful nods to the bands who inspired them and to the punk spirit that informs their performance.  There are some great off-the-cuff moments too, like their doing 'More Than A Feeling' at the beginning of 'Teen Spirit', and Kurt's prompting the audience to scream, \\"We love you Courtney\\".    On the negative side, I agree with the other reviewer who complained about the inserted cheers.  It sounds ridiculous and bothered me enough to make this a 4-star product versus a 5.  Also, the Cd is not the best live album ever.  They removed all of the banter and the 'More Than A Feeling' bit, probably for continuity.  But, as the recent live REM CDs demonstrate, leaving the banter in gives the live disc a feeling of authenticity and adds to the whole experience.  But if you're like me and will only listen to it cranked up in your car, then it's worth it to get the deluxe version.  Either way, the DVD is a must for any Nirvana fan.
B002T45VX6|5.0|\\"She Wolf\\" is a great cd. Actually, it was a cd that took me some time to get used to listen with pleasure. I'm not a Shakira fan, I don't like so mush Spanish music, but she has a great voice and talent.And she has a beautiful soul. All the songs please me very much now, the only one I don't particularly like so much is \\"Spy\\",that definitely is not better than \\"Hip's don't lie\\", from her last cd.    Anyway, this cd is a 'must have' and it is good from the beginning to the end.    Some people say that the cd is weak and that it has poor lyrics but I do not agree at all.    All the songs are agitated with the exception of \\"Gipsy\\" that has a lighter take to it, but not enough to diverge from the rest of the disc. \\"She Wolf\\" and \\"Good Stuff\\" are definitely the ones I prefer, but \\"Did it again\\", \\"Why wait\\" and \\"Long time\\" are great and well elaborated.

B002QY9RMA|2.0|The Good: For the person whose been hiding under a rock and doesn't already have \\"I am Sasha Fierce\\", congrats. Now you can own a 18 track edition that includes the upbeat Poison (another Sweet Dreams style of a song)plus the remix of Video Phone featuring Lady Gaga.. This cd is Beyonce's best album to date since leaving Destiny's Child and going solo    The Bad: Why another release or re-release. I strongly resent how record companies seem to produce 10 different versions of the same cd in an effort to maximize profits at the expense of hard-working fans. I already owned the previous Deluxe version with the then bonus 4 tracks. So I had to buy this version just for 2 songs.     The UGLY: Here's the bitter rub. This isn't even the best version. In Europe and Asia, Beyonce's Platinum Edition features 20 songs and a bonus cd of all her videos to-date for practically the same price. Missing on this US and Canadian only version are the amazing ballads: Save the Hero, Why Don't You Love me and Honestly.    The Ultimate version could have been a two cd compilation including the 3 songs on the Euro / Asian version plus the 2 featured on the North American version and then some remixes from Above and Beyonce.     And record companies wonder why cd sales are declining?!!
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|First, the high points :<br />1. Details are fantastic:<br />You can see the veneers on Scotty's Teeth (Wolf in the Fold)<br />You can see that computer tapes are painted pieces of wood (Obsession)<br />You can read the certificates on the walls (Devil in the Dark)<br />2. The original 1-minute 'next time' previews are included (albeit, w/noise)<br />3. You can flip between original (w/noise) and new special effects.<br />4. You see the full episode, not someone's edited-to-squeeze-more-commercials version.<br /><br />Now, the low points<br /><br />The Blue-ray quality is so good, that in some cases the remastered special effect are obviously computer generated! On DirecTV SD resolution, the new special effects are not discernible. The same episode in Blu-Ray HD, at times, looks a little plastic and fake. However, not all planets look like 'shooter' marbles in the new series, and there are many nice details (such as when the Enterprise warps out of orbit from the planet in 'Obsession' and there is a giant blast crater created by an antimatter explosion, visible on the surface.)<br /><br />Personally, I dislike the new special-effects intros, because the enterprise seems to fly towards the camera with the saucer section facing DOWNWARDS.  It is not flying level, imho, like in the original series.  Also, I expected more creativity in the re-doing of 'The Doomsday Machine' special effects, because the doomsday machine itself should have been MUCH larger than the enterprise (as much as 50,000x larger than the ~1000-ft enterprise), otherwise, it could never have eaten a planet the size of earth.  However, maybe this was just a hole in the plot so large that it could never be filled?  I don't know.<br /><br />In the DVD Guide, there are no episode summaries. If you don't know the exact plot of each episode, by title, sorry, you're out of luck. They should have added space for maybe 3 sentences of text so that you could choose between episodes.<br /><br />Now, the biggest drawback of these episodes is the lousy and cheap way they produced the DVD carrier. The index to shows is ONLY printed on the inside cover of the DVD carrier, so you have to look through the blue plastic at the really, really tiny print to figure out which disk to read. What's even WORSE is that Disc #7 covers up HALF the episode titles !!<br /><br />I recommend that when you get the discs, you should immediately take out the paper insert and make a 95% xerox copy of it. Then, cut it out, fold it in half, and slip it into the paper clamps at the front of the DVD. That way, you can open the DVD box, and immediately open your xerox-page (no need to remove it from the paper clamps), to find the episode you're looking for.<br /><br />What's more, if you want to see a particular episode, like \\"Menagerie\\", you have to know what season it was from!

0307269981|5.0|This book, like it's predecessor \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a great read.  It is quite long, so if you like quick reads, this one is not.  Like many, I grew quite intrigued with Salander and Blomkvist in the first book and couldn't wait to see what happened next.  This book reveals a lot more about both of them, particularly Salander. And, as you might have guessed from the first book, it's not pretty.  Salander has skeletons in her closet and she revisits many of them in this book.<br /><br />I highly recommned starting with the first book, although this one is a good story all by itself, I think the order of the books is important in this series.  I eagerly await the next one and hate that there's only three!
B0029RQE84|4.0|An unusual quiet album reminding Knopfler's soundtracks \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\". The first 5 tracks are really disappointing but this changes with the great \\"Cleaning my Gun\\" and stays on this high level to the end.  \\"Get lucky\\" is the prove: MK is not only a God on guitar, the man really can sing!  The Bonus-DVD with the Video of \\"Cleaning my Gun\\" a studiotour and a Photosession is not a highlight but a nice extra.

B0000057C5|5.0|First of all, many hard rock fans think Rammstein are too heavy for them. And most of their fans are either metal heads, or open minded real music fans. Many metal heads tough, think they are too light and some even complain because the lyrics are in german and they can't understand a word. I, am i fan of some industrial music such as Skinny puppy and industrial metal mostly so if you like either, then you'll love Rammstein. This album has unique sounds then gets straight to pretty heavy riffs and creates some kick @ss music. Lets just say if you want something that sounded kinda new back in the late 90's, then you should buy Sehnsucht. Till's voice is powerful and you can fee it whether he is shouting or singing softly. Sure, a lot of people accuse Rammstein of not being true metal, but i see nothing fake about them. There's many heavier straight up metal bands, but many try different things out there. So get it! this is their best release ever.
B00000DC10|5.0|I've owned three copies of this album, two on CD (the second coming after the first simply got handled too much) and the third on DVD Audio.  Having bought the first copy back when it came out (late 98, early 99 or so) I can honestly say that even after listening to it for 10 years and having memorized every single nuance and fill, it still holds up.  There's simply not another band that has come close to creating a solid full album like this.  It's vicious, it's beautiful, it's perfect.
B001U6YI92|5.0|THE MEANING OF SERGIO LEONE'S WORK<br /><br />Spaghetti Westerns were the first significant movies I watched as a little boy growing up in some East European backwater, back in the late sixties. And Sergio Leone was the Spaghetti king. What could be more subversive in a world aiming at total or totalitarian state-enforced collectivism than watching these rugged individualists, Italian-speaking 'cowboys' answering to American names, relentlessly and usually violently pursuing their own greedy goals while the world around was cracking and collapsing with a so-called 'civil' war raging? Add to that those wide shots of small men under immense, blue, cloudless dessert skies and Clint Eastwood's cigars and the effects of all those years of constant and persistent indoctrination were irreversibly blown away by 3 hours of movie viewing.<br /><br />It's hard to quantify the role Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood played in the collapse of communism - after all, what followed isn't exactly the happy-go-lucky Wild West - but almost certainly we wouldn't have the Tarantino some of us love and the massive Stephen King's Dark Tower saga might not exist at all - and this is just scratching the surface. Maybe Sergio Leone is not the sole mother of all contemporary creative artistic expressions but he's clearly one of their more prominent godfathers.<br /><br />THE RESTORATION<br /><br />These being said, the restoration and actual reconstruction of his work was something that HAD to be done because we can't afford having these masterpieces degrade any further. What came out is certainly not 'perfect' but it's great work for sure and, as a digital product, it can't degrade any more.<br /><br />The restorers succeeded in giving us, Americans, what Europeans always had - the 'full' movie, not the butchered American version, 15 or 20 minutes shorter, made so to meet the business demands of theater operators. It was hard to find film of an acceptable quality for all the chapters and, at least in one instance, what was found was too damaged to be included in the film but, whenever possible, the lost content was added and the restorers even brought back Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach to do their voices over the Italian-speaking cuts. The picture was cleaned up and the restorers even managed to turn the mono sound track into a 5.1 surround, adding a few sound effects when needed - yes, it's not 100% the original sound track but I'm not complaining.<br /><br />THE BLU EDITON<br /><br />This edition is the 2003 restored movie. As I noted above, it gets a DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound track and it's 2 minutes shy of 3 hours long. For a 1966 movie done on the cheap back then - it cost only a little over $1 million to make it - the restoration quality is above expectations. Not everything is perfect. Sometimes we even get to see the proverbial 'hair' at the bottom of the screen and not a lot of time was invested in creating the 5.1 sound track but what we get is probably better than what I saw as a little boy in the movie theater.<br /><br />In addition, there is a serious complement of extras. There are two separate commentary soundtracks by Richard Schickel, an Eastwood biographer and by Christopher Frayling, a noted authority when it comes to Sergio Leone. Then, there's the \\"Leone's West\\" documentary, discussing the making of the movie, another featurette on Sergio Leone himself, a short on the actual Civil War events that the movie seems to refer to, a very informative short on the restoration process and two extras on Ennio Morricone, the composer responsible for the innovative sound track.<br /><br />Sadly, the packaging is not what I expected. The disk comes inside one of the cheapest Blu-ray case made so far - the kind that has holes in it to save one or two pennies worth of plastic but... I can live with that.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I am VERY happy with this restoration. I think it's the best we are going to get for many years to come so... enjoy it. I know that I am. It's 5 stars without hesitation.njoy it. I know that I am. It's 5 stars without hesitation.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought \\"Oh God, another one of those movies.\\" But I was surprised that after I'd gone and seen it, I'd actually thoroughly enjoyed it.        Isabelle Fuhrman is the \\"orphan\\"; that is, 9-year-old Esther who seems a little strange and morbid despite the adopted parents instance attraction to her. When violent events began taking place that are connected to Esther, the parents began to suspect that there is more to the little girl than appears.        Fuhrman definitely was the right choice for the role of Esther; she has an attractive face and her youth doesn't strain her acting abilities which were very convincing. I won't lie though; the movie was very grisly, and even I had to turn away from the screen a few times. Even the twist ending really shocked me, and I'm not easily shocked. I really think that despite how it looks, give it a shot, because it wasn't a bad little movie. It was well acted, well thought out, and seriously creepy.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|After this many years and albums, a few of which seemed to be done on cruise control, Marillion really had no business releasing an album as sensational as Marbles which is very possibly their best Hogarth recording. This is by far their best effort since Afraid of Sunlight and has renewed my interest in the band.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Actually my comments are not so much a review of John Mayer's new music ... as all the expert reviewers (Matt S. / R.Reid / T.Hopkins) have already done that so well. Rather my comments are directed towards the above mentioned reviewers expert opinions. By the way, have I already mentioned that I have never heard of any of you. But yet you write so professionally, so eloquently. How is it that I never heard of any of you before today? Perhaps, it is because I don't focus often enough on reading negative, hateful reviews. I just can't believe I've not heard of at least one of you guys before. Are any of you professional musicians? No, well too bad. I'm quite sure if any of you were ... there would probably be a few expert reviewers waiting to comment on your latest work. And I'm equally as sure that you would all take their insightful comments to heart and make your next project even better. You know, I bet I never heard of the three of you before today because I don't read the latest music reviews in industry publications. I'm sure that's it.    And on a more personal note ... John, thanks for continuing to share your words and music with all the rest of us. We all appreciate how much you must sacrifice in your personal life in an effort to get your music out there for people who relate to it. Thank you John. I hope I get the opportunity to see you in concert!
B002X20W2E|4.0|Anyone who wants \\"GGGB\\" Rihanna will be sorely disappointed.  \\"Rated R\\" is a much more serious, contemplative, dark, moody fare which shows a much more personal side to the singer.  This album is much more lyric driven in comparison to her last effort and definitely shows growth in Rihanna as an artist.  Do not be scared off by a few f bombs or what may be in your opinion, a \\"bad single choice\\", this CD is definitely a grower and will gain her new fans.
B000ENC6XM|3.0|The HD-DVD movie did not work(would not play in any DVD Players)<br />I notified the seller and becuase DVD was the last in stock<br />I was given a refund.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This CD is amazing. Some songs I wouldn't necessarily just lay back and listen to, as they're more fillers, but even so, it adds to the experience, especially if you just want to play the entire track in one go. All of the songs are intense and really catchy. I love this CD and can't imagine getting tired of it.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Dumbo is the story of a baby elephant born with enormous ears.  When the other circus elephants reject him, and his mother is locked away as a \\"mad elephant\\" for trying to protect her baby, Dumbo's only friend turns out to be Timothy, the circus mouse.  Together, they learn that huge ears can be an asset.<br /><br />This movie has much to recommend it. It's only an hour long, which means it won't bore kids beyond their attention span.  Its message of treating those with differences or handicaps fairly and kindly is important for everyone to hear.<br /><br />Best of all, it has some wonderful musical numbers.  \\"Baby Mine\\" still brings tears to my eyes all these years later, and \\"When I See an Elephant Fly\\" is hysterically funny to those old enough to understand the word play.  But \\"Pink Elephants\\" has got to be one of the most inventive and clever numbers ever devised.  The constantly morphing elephants of this sequence were all hand-drawn -- no computers used at all!<br /><br />Caution:  This movie was made in the 1950's, and there is some ethnic stereotyping that can be offensive.  For instance, the ringmaster, who has a thick Italian accent, is somewhat of a buffoon.  Also, the musical number \\"When I See an Elephant Fly\\" is sung by crows that are clearly meant to be African Americans.  They use some poor grammar and in other ways conform to common stereotypes of the times.  However, I believe that little children won't understand the stereotype, or it can be dealt with by explaining that the crows don't go to school, so they don't talk correctly.  Adults will know better and will be able to enjoy the clever word play in the song.<br /><br />Another caution is that the stork delivers the circus animal babies.  That might take some explaining!
B000VI6T6U|5.0|I had previously seen some limited clips of Hendrix' performance at Monterey but never the entire set. I was truly blown away. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a huge Hendrix fan but I can be objective when it comes to comparing various works by Hendrix (I have see & heard some of the bootleg garbage out there and also when Hendrix' performance was sub par). The raw talent of Hendix is quite evident throughout and it appears as though his guitar is just another appendage of his which he uses almost involuntarily. There is talent and hard work and then there is a gift. Hendirx certainly did work very hard at his craft but he was certainly a gifted musician whose contribution to rock music was all too brief. Even though his professional career was very short, he contributed a tremendous body of work which establishes his position in history as the greatest, and most innovative, electric guitarist of all time.
B002R68U7K|5.0|Over the course of her career, SO many of britney's club mixes of her singles have been spread across several discs, both domestic and import CD singles as well as vinyl, including DJ promo only vinyl with mixes that never had commercial releases. This expensive box would have been an IDEAL chance to bring all those mixes together. But here, there are barely any full length club mixes, and most of them already appeared on CD. You get:<br /><br />Me Against The Music (Passengerz vs. The Club mix) (7:34)<br />Toxic (Bloodshy & Avant's Intoxicated mix) (5:35)<br />Everytime (above & beyond club mix) (8:46)<br />My Prerogative (armand van helden remix) (7:48)<br />Do Somethin (Thick Vocal mix) (7:59)<br />Gimme More (Paul Oakenfold mix) (6:08)<br />Piece of Me (Bloodshy & Avant's Boz o Lo remix) (4:53)<br />Womanizer (Kaskade mix) (5:31)<br />Circus (Tom Neville ringleader mix) (7:52)<br />Radar (Bloodshy & Avant remix) (5:43)<br />3 (Groove Police Club mix) (7:42)<br /><br />All remaining remixes are short remixes to begin with or EDITS of longer club mixes. A CD has 80 minutes of free space, and on each of these discs we're not getting more than 10 minutes of music in most cases. This entire boxed set worth of music could have probably fit on 3 or 4 CDs and been sold for about 25 dollars less!<br /><br />And consider this. As of this writing, there has been no CD single release for 3, so if you want the club mix of this song on CD, you have to buy this entire boxed set. Other than that, the ONLY track in this boxed set that I didn't have on CD was the remix of Radar! Where are the big club remixes that have never been on CD before of songs like My Prerogative? Outrageous? Toxic? You Drive Me Crazy? Lucky? Breath On Me? Me Against the Music? I'm a Slave 4U? Many of the mixes of these songs were only available on vinyl and DJ promo vinyl. It would not only have been a sign of appreciation to fans to make this an expansive singles collection, it also would have been a testament to Britney's club appeal over the years. As it is now, your not getting much of anything that a hardcore fan wouldn't already have.our not getting much of anything that a hardcore fan wouldn't already have.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Love Story meets The Poseidon Adventure as two star-crossed lovers keep their romance afloat even as everything around them is sinking.  Despite choppy scene transition and staginess, James Cameron manages to turn a well-known disaster into a story of love (almost) triumphing over life itself.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|1997 gave us two of the best movies of the decade...Titanic, and Contact.  From the opening shot to the end credits, Contact is a combination of great acting, (led by the always amazing Jodie Foster), great story and amazing directing by Robert Zemeckis.  Entertaining and inspiring.  A classic.
B00003CXB4|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie!  Came in a timely fashion & was packaged very well.  Thank you!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I love this ep with the 8 new songs ! Lady Gaga is definitely the best new artist ever! She has done it all with her hot funky style, music videos and songs that you can't get out of your head. This album doesn't skip a beat anywhere, and every track is purely phenomenonal and very original. She will definitely be around for a very long time. My favorite tracks are Bad Romance, Speechless, Dance In The Dark, and So Happy I Could Die even though all of them are amazing! Go buy it if you loved The Fame!
0307266303|4.0|Entertaining and interesting. Why not to use expensive running shoes. Man can run longer than imagined.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|Every time I listen to this CD, I appreciate it even more. I cant remember the last time I purchased a CD and loved every song. The entire CD is so amazing.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I have been a huge JM fan since I first heard Room for Squares back in high school.  That being said I was waiting for this CD with great anticipating and I have to admit that I was quite disappointed.  Its not that the CD is bad, but it feels unfinished and over produced-Please tell me who thought it was a good idea to have the drums play the same beat over the first 3 or 4 songs?     If you are looking for anything like Continum on this CD, Assasin, Heartbreak Warfare and Edge of Desire are the only two songs that come remotly close.  Its not that I want another Continum because I like when musicians try new things, but I feel like these songs could be great but are mediocre due to overproducing and a lack of JM guitar emphasis.  This CD could have been great with a little tweaking.  I'm just dissapointed that the musician I have come to love isn't able to break through the layers of production.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|There was no mention either on Amazon or on the CD case that this album was edited/censored! \\"Bitc*\\" just doesn't sound natural as \\"bit.\\" Period. If the record companies are going to continue to censor albums that I shelled out my hard-earned money for, I will have no qualms nor any feeling of emotional turmoil or moral dilemma downloading uncensored bootlegged versions for free instead and keeping my cash. Record/releasing companies: Release the unedited album now and at no additional cost to those of us who already bought this censored garbage!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a voice of unique timbre, clarity and color, along with great reserves of true horsepower. The only singer I can bring to mind who combined such sweetness and strength is the late Kate Smith. Like Smith, Boyle is able to range over many styles and carry each one off well. She deserves the success she has achieved.
B001UV4XTC|5.0|I suspect it will take some time for critics and audiences to catch up with it, but \\"A Serious Man\\" is a great film -- bleak, challenging, mordantly funny, and shot through with profound implications.  Whenever a truly original work of cinematic art arrives in our midst, it is likely to be misunderstood -- check out the first reviews of Alain Resnais's \\"Providence\\" or, more recently, \\"Magnolia.\\"  As much as I've enjoyed some earlier films by the Coen brothers, \\"A Serious Man\\" is in another league altogether.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase of Toy Story One.  Our three year old was hooked on Toy Story Two and our \\"One\\" was a tape that had broken.  We were so burned out on Toy Story Two that we are thrilled to have this change.  The quality of the DVD is perfect and it is really getting a work-out as it is \\"our\\" new favorite.  Another great purchase from Amazon.
1416594787|5.0|Those of you out there who have allowed yourselves to become brain-washed by some ancient ridiculous middle-eastern myths and legends (ie Christianity, Islam, etc.) probably won't want to read this book, but you should. It's fun, it's informative, and it's far closer to the truth than anything you will ever learn in bible school.    Richard Dawkins outlines the scientific evidence for evolution with just enough detail to get his point across without ever becoming ponderous or over-bearing. The book is loaded with facts such as how to date archeological specimens and how the continents split apart from one another, and there is a lot of fascinating information about DNA, embryology, speciation, and how to determine how closely related various animals are to one another.    I'm tempted to start giving away some of the many interesting anecdotes about different types of animals, but I'm going to restrain myself so I won't spoil the book for you.    So just go read it! You'll be glad you did! I guarantee it!
0140277447|3.0|The Rape of Nanking is such a famous title, that perhaps I was expecting too much, but the book was ultimately disappointing to me. It is very interesting, and the autrocities it chronicles are horrendous, but it lacked the power that I assumed it would have. Chang's style of writing I don't find particularly smooth, indeed, at times it strikes me as clunky, but more importantly however, the blunt and matter of fact way she totals up the deaths and describes the massacres lessons the book's power. Indeed, rather than humanizing the subject matter Chang's style is paradoxically dehumanizing to some degree, as she all to often fails to put a human face on the thousands being killed here, hundreds being butchered there. Still, the work is an important and informative one, and well worth the read for a better understanding of the character of the Imperial Japanese forces and the war in China - a war and a level of brutality that is far too often whitewashed by those in Japan and strangely ignored by the west, so preoccupied with the horrors of the Holocaust.
B002JODV3S|4.0|Vai's performance along with his band is stellar. Shot in a great venue that I've been in many times, the energy was pure. A few sound volume and freguency issues that I thought were distracting from the overall disk experience, and no high def audio tracks (only dolby 5.0) was a little disappointing for blu ray. Great show - great musicians all around the band.
B0013FYTAI|5.0|has two of my new favorite songs and love the rest (it's clean, a good thing). love it love it love it.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|This first Dune novel, along with the second one one of the series (Dune Messiah) is my all time favorite novel of any kind.  I first read it as a teenager and have read it at least once a decade since.  I am currently re-reading this edition on my brand, spanking new Kindle and it is every bit as good as I remember it.  I am amazed that each time I read it, as I pass through different periods of my life, I find different things to enjoy about the story and pick up something new every time.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough!  This is why it's my first Amazon book review.  I couldn't come up with a better first book.
B000KFTWIG|5.0|I dont care where you from you have to respect the man. He came from nothing and became a rap legend. The Ready to Die album is a classic itz like a story book of his life. IDK why people hate big but they can hate all they want but he was the G.O.A.T. I love 90's hip-hop and B.I.G. is my favorite 90's rapper. Top 5 songs Juicy, Gimme The Loot, The What, Big Poppa, and Warning.

B0000039QA|5.0|One of the Best albums of all times, B.I.G. made a classic album I can't name not one song that is wack. The album is the best off of bad boy and it will never be match. In 97 I was 9 years old when he died and after one month I kept hearing about The Notorious Big and I wanted to get the album but momz told me no at the time. I love Sky Is The Limit it is one of my favorite songs off the album. Top 5 songs Sky Is The Limit, Hypnotize, Mo Money Mo Problems, I Love The Dough, and Long Kiss Goodnight

B000J103X4|4.0|The second album from The Game is good but not his best. I love the One Blood track and the trach with him and Kanye West Wouldn't Get Far. The Game is on very hot beats and his lyrics are very good as well. top 5 songs One Blood, Wouldn't Get Far, Why You Hate The Game, Let's Ride, and Remedy
031606792X|4.0|I can see what Myer's had in mind while writing this book. She wanted everyone to get their happily ever after. But come on.... Bella gets everything she wants. The whole pregancy thing was just........... I mean, this is the girl edward had to bride marrying him by telling her that they'll finally have sex. I guess that was the magic word. I did love Renesmee, though. But I felt it was a bit weird Jacob(my love!) imprinting on Bella's daughter. To close in the family for me. But I am gald he ended up happy. And for all u sick minded people out their.... Jacob is not a pediphile. He doesn't even see her like that now. He see's her like a littler sister. There is nothing romantic about it until she is of age.
B002MW50KO|5.0|There is little to compare to the honesty and genuine heartfelt sincerity of this album. In his own inimitable way Dylan has once again set the standard by which all Christmas Albums will be measured. How many crooners of the past ever cared enough for their audience or less for their own pocketbook to produce an album of Christmas Carols and donate the proceeds to the hungry children of the world?  Don't look back Como and Crosby....the Bobsters on your tail!!!! Bob Dylan is a modern hero in all senses of the word, a troubador, a poet, a songwriter,a saint and evangelist that puts his money and his deeds where his mouth is....Thank God there are still people like this man to model \\" man at his best\\" for the rest of the sorry entertainment industry. Although its been said many times many ways it took Bob Dylan to teach us what \\"Merry Christmas to you\\" really means....Merry Christmas, Bob.....and thanks.
B000GFLKEY|3.0|I don't write spoilers. A good plot, keeps you guessing. A plot flaw or three in the mix, but not terminal. The fatal flaw? No climax, & no final explanation. Unbelievable... Too many loose ends, unexplained motives, & no closure = take a pass on this one. On the bright side. I only paid 75 cents plus shipping for it :-). It was worth that much. I'll use my imagination to show how badly Spike Lee dropped the ball, here.
6305508550|4.0|This disk was not quite in as good condition as it was made out to be, but it plays fine in a DVD player and for all practical reasons was a good buy. Shipped in about the amount of time expected.
B002QB1910|5.0|Did not expect this level of variance. You are taken back when you listen to the emotion in the music. \\"Last Song\\" is incredibly deep. Rihanna shows her true talent as a artist and there is no substitute. It;s a grown up album for those who look for something deeper than the pop-pop-pop. Enjoy!
0879309210|5.0|I was surprised by the quality and content of this supplement. I commend those who are starting the work of professional restoration of guitars or even a hobby.

0061537969|5.0|This is a short review. I totally loved this book. I've gone back through it a number of times to re-read my favorite passages. Enzo is a fully developed character, even though he's a dog. I postponed reading The Art of Racing in the Rain because dog stories make me cry. This book is no exception, but the ending more than redeems the tears. I'm giving The Art of Racing in the Rain as Christmas gifts to all my dog-loving friends.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|To paraphrase Quentin Tarantino:  \\"I believe the world can be split into two groups of people.  Either you're an Elvis fan or you're a Beatles fan.\\"  I personally am a Beatles fan.  I adjusted this statement to fit into my lifestyle better and I believe you are either a Star Trek fan or as Star Wars fan.  I am firmly entrenched in the latter group of Star Wars fans (ducks the random items thrown at him).    Despite the above, I have seen all but a couple of the Star Trek films (all the good ones and a couple of the not so good ones I didn't see the most recent couple of offerings)  and remember enough about the TV series from my older brothers watching it to know enough about the characters and stories to follow along and be entertained.    I loved this movie.  It had a great feel to it.  It really felt like Star Trek to me.  I've heard complaints that they tried to turn Star Trek into Star Wars with this film but I humbly disagree.  This movie had that Star Trek attitude and none of the Star Wars atmosphere.  This movie was outstanding to the point that I am actually considering purchasing the DVDs of the original TV series.    I have to say this is IMHO the second best Trek movie.  Second only to Wrath of Khan, but it's close.
0061053430|5.0|first of all, i don't own this book (but this chanukah, i will own it, literaly) but i have seen it in the past. suprisingly (sorry for my spelling)i remember why i was interested in it. i read mostly the weapons, the tatics, and the aliens (and their weakpoint) but the book got scary as it went, but after seening aliens i was not afriad. finally i am going to be reunited with my favorite sci fi movie book.    one more thing, this book is like a darker version of max brooks's \\"zombie survival guide\\" but set in the aliens universe (with extra content. i am glad i am getting this for chanukah.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Wow, so I must say that I am a Jane Austen purist: I don't read any of the continuation books, because I want to keep Jane Austen's wonderful characters in her masterpiece, 'Pride & Prejudice' in their natural, meant-to-be state, and not confuse them.      I don't know why I choose to pick this up, but I am SO glad I did: maybe because in my mind I already seperate books and movies...movies are often inspired by books or are edited versions of books, or are completely different, so I think of them seperately.  'Lost in Austen' was a hilarious & refreshing Jane Austen romp: you just have to have fun with it!    As far as content goes, I will watch it again shortly and come back & update this, but I don't recall much beyond a little language and maybe some sensual sitations: things like an unmarried couple living together in the modern world, etc.  It's reasonably family-friendly:    The actors were great, Darcy was absolutely smoldering at times: when Amanda takes Lizzie's place, her modern clothes, language, actions & that song (you know what I mean!) are quite funny!  If it were I that was pulled back into that world, I feel I would have fit in better: the twists on characters stories, and on their character itself, was more amusing than disturbing: just think of this as a fun, random, not-true film and you won't mind that the story is a bit skewed: you'll be too busy rolling on the floor laughing ~ definitely recommend!
B000CNE164|5.0|Nina Simone sang many styles of music well, including soul and jazz, but to me, this is Nina at her best.  She squeezes every drop of emotion from her voice.  This is raw, passionate blues, and I think it's one of the more important albums of the 60's.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that this album is too short.  That's unfair, given that this is an original album.  However, if you want a longer album, there is a compilation called \\"The Blues\\" that reproduces this original album with additional tracks.  I'd recommend buying that CD instead.
0920668372|5.0|Was very pleased with the book I received...    Mrs. Fred (Connie) Stinson
0439813786|4.0|\\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" is an amazing book. It tells the story of a boy who's orphaned, taken in by his miserable uncle, and then orphaned again. It's a story ultimately about faith and persistence and trust. The faith and persistence not being Hugo's, but rather those who stand firmly enough against the boy's rejection, that he finds that eventually he can trust once again.<br /><br />The book is huge, by the way, with over 500 pages, but they aren't filled with text. Instead what you get is a book that is mostly graphic. Beautiful line drawings that fade in and out of the story, giving you text when you need it, but showing you otherwise what the story is about with images.<br /><br />Brian Selznick's book was a National Book Award Finalist, and is written at the AR 5.1 level (Accelerated Reading). The book is suitable for older elementary aged kids on up. Adults and Young Adults will appreciate the artwork more than the story. Children will be pleased by both, as they follow Hugo Cabret's adventures in France in 1931.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and reviewer at BooksForKids-reviews<br />(1049)
B0026P3G12|5.0|I received the much-anticipated CD in today's mail and after listening to the album I feel Susan Boyle has the depth of a true artist.  Her voice is crystal clear and the depth of emotion is truly magnificent.  After having seen her on BGT I was astounded and now feel she is right up there with the very best in her field. I only hope there will be many more albums to follow.

B000002IAZ|5.0|I bought on vinyl when it first came out. A true classic. Wanted it on CD too. Just great!
B0026P3G12|4.0|This album gets a 5 star rating for Ms.Boyle's voice. The CD gets 3 for the collection of songs. This is not the sort of album you'd put on for great background music at a party. (Silent Night and How Great Thou Art over canapes anyone?) The collection of songs is disparate to say the least. If the producer was trying to get an album out quickly but before he could figure out what sort of songs Ms Boyle is best suited for, then this is an unqualified success. IMHO, Ms Boyle could sing the telephone book and make it sound good. Her soaring voice 'shouts' show tunes, torch songs, religious songs and even R&B..... just not all on the same album. I am indeed looking forward to the next one!

B002SJIO5E|5.0|My first impression about a quarter way into this movie, was \\"Oh, NO! Another aliens-as-racial-minority metaphor!\\" Yes, yes, I know all that, I just wanna be entertained- that theme's been done, then done again, then again ..ad nauseum. I was thinking the only way to save the plot line was to have the aliens relocated to Chicago as new Obama voters. Then I was pleasantly  surprised.    So what does save this movie and transcends it beyond the predictable racism-is-bad, apartheid-is-bad \\"message\\", what saves it is that ultimately it doesn't take itself seriously, at which point the movie becomes immensely entertaining. The matter of fact story telling absorbs the viewer to accept the premise despite one's common sense. Looking like something I ate at last summer's clambake, the alien CGI is nearly flawless.    Best of all, the witty screenplay has such wry humor that it leaves nothing and no one unscathed. From the Afrikaner elites, to the S.A. Blacks ( who, themselves victims of cruel apartheid, display the same sentiments to these new arrivals), to the aliens themselves portrayed more like insects with a gusto for cat food and tires, advanced technology notwithstanding. Not to mention the proverbial military-industrial complex (always a good villain). Even political correctness is mocked as we follow that dolt of a protagonist's rise via nepotism to a position of authority. His adventures inspecting the District is a rich example of irony as mockumentary.    Of course the tired apartheid-alien message continues throughout the movie: segregated slums, Nazi inspired experiments, sham laws, forced mass evacuations, one from the \\"majority\\" transforming into one of the \\"minority\\".  But as the movie progresses this theme becomes so cliche that it barely rises to consciousness and renders it meaningless. And that is a good thing. There's a world of serious cinema dealing with that subject more worthy to explore than a movie such as this. At best, maybe use it as a teaching tool on your middle-schooler about the lessons of apartheid.    So to all initially put off about this film, I say give it a view. It won't disappoint.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|The main word that comes to mind is \\"refreshing\\". While I'm not a victim, I have been a serious rock fan for 40 years. Was getting bored with the current scene of the last 10 years and bought this as a last-ditch effort to see what's up. Well kids, the game has been raised! How great is it to see a group of musicians enjoying themselves, enjoying the music, with NO wink-wink, clique-ish snobbery - just total comittment to the show. If you're losing your faith in Rock, visit the Albert Hall footage and REPENT!

0131103628|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm not a novice programmer, so this review will be biased given that fact alone. That said this book was an eye opener on so many levels. One thing that is NEVER touched upon by other C programming books is project management and modularization. Chapter 4 of this book had a great discussion on techniques to organize code. This is not a big deal for the hobbyist, but for us programmers in industry dealing with large embedded projects it is. E.g., try to avoid extern variables, publish only what is needed to header files, etc.<br /><br />Outside of that K&R avoids the pitfall of discussing every single point; they only discuss what is necessary to write modular, system independent, and well organized code. This book also discusses the history of parts of the language and what the intent was when writing the language. This is far more important than many people think because now you're tapping into years of rich programming experience at Bell labs where K&R worked.<br /><br />Lastly, this book CAN be conquered by novice programmers, but they will have to read this book slowly and hang on every word. This isn't too daunting because, excluding the reference, we're looking at 189 pages of text. Not all of the problems need be worked to gain full understanding of this book. Some problems are trivial, while others are so broad that the answers border on becoming subjective. Either way, they should all be attempted and thought about. A solution manual is worth investing in, but is not necessary. If you decide to embark on the journey through this book devote AT LEAST a month to it. Reading slowly and actively thinking about what's going on will reward you with a lifetime of C programming knowledge.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|I must admit, I haven't bought a c.d. in years since I had an ipod.Lady GaGa is one of the few artists who devotes everything to the fans, so I decided to buy her c.d. in show of my support.    I had already listened to a few leaked songs that were awesome so I knew I would get my money's worth. This c.d. is has plenty of great tracks and I was not the least bit disspointed. My favortie tracks are \\" Dance in the Dark\\" and of course, \\" Bad Romance\\".
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Many things have already been said in terms of technical specs by previous reviews that I would have put forth, so I'm just going to go by what 'my' ears hear.  Obviously die-hard audiophiles will undoubtedly dislike the new mixes and remastering done to these albums, and this is understandable....you get attuned to a mix that's been used for decades, only to have it drastically changed...not just a little EQ tweaking...for these sets.  I can only speak for myself, my limited hearing range...which is not 'audiophile' quality hearing like that of other (and longer-time than me I'm sure) Genesis fanatics, and going off my previous installments of these albums...the mid-'90s Definitive Edition Remasters (sans Trespass, which just got a staight to CD-from-analog tape treatment in 1993 for U.S. release).    That in mind, this, the first set of albums (the last to be released), collectively the Gabriel-era and Genesis' most 'progressive' period, is the most sonically improved of the three studio collections.  Of particular note is one of my all-time favorite, overlooked and under-rated albums, Trespass, where I got my start on Gabriel period material back in 2000 (been a Genesis fan since the early/mid 1980s though with Collins-fronted material ).  For nearly 10 years, my ears have had to put up with the muddy sound of the 1993 MCA-issued U.S. CD, with its instrumentation buried in a sea of rumble-and-hum, enough to the point where the intricate nuances of such things like those 12-string guitar passages in \\"White Mountain' only being audible with the volume cranked...which of course also increased the interfering background noise.    What a revelation for my ears.  The new remaster and remix of this particular CD, are like a dense fog had been lifted up and revealed the clear blue sky.  Gone is that constant low rumbling 'hum' in the quieter passages of Looking for Someone and White Mountain, all instrumentation and Gabriel's vocal coming through as if this album were released just yesterday.  Visions of Angels, Stagnation and The Knife floored me...the latter has to be the loudest, hardest-rocking song these guys did, it's no wonder it became a concert favorite in those early days.  Dusk is perhaps the prettiest thing this period of the band did...and the remix finally makes some vocals, once buried, easily understandable.    I've only gotten up through Nursery Cryme so far, but that particular CD in this set held more surprises.  New instrumentation and clearer vocals buried in the mid-1990s 'remastering' jumped out at me right away.  I'm looking forwards to the rest.  Just the two aforementioned CDs above blow the so-called 'Definitive' discs away.    There's no denying....the sound can be quite hard on the ears at times, but I've discovered these mixes sound better through a stereo system (a decent to high-end setup, not over a computer or low-end stereo equipment) with proper EQ adjustment done to get things just right, rather than playing them through headphones.  It 'is' rather unfortunate that, because of the age we now live in, with everyone ripping their purchased CDs or downloading MP3s here @ Amazon or elsewhere, that the overall 'loudness' of the finished mix is brought up to sometimes excruciating levels.  It's no fun fiddling around with adjustments to a separate EQ, but taking the time will make these new mixes more enjoyable.    I have to upgrade my DVD setup to BluRay with digital-out optical to take advantage of the Dolby Digital Stereo and DTS 5.1 versions, but I'm anxious to tear into those discs as well, along with all the bonus content.    The packaging is nice, and the extra tracks are interesting, and the booklet gives nice album-by-album details, and each of the CDs liners includes all the lyrics and original artwork.    All in all, a little EQ adjusting, played back over a decent setup and this winds up an enjoyable listen for me thus far.  It was worth the money to me.

B0012Y22KO|1.0|Before you even think of buying this, I tell you: DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Here are some \\"clues\\":  1. Remastered? Don't think so.  2. Booklet according to the big letters that compose the word BOX-SET? Don't think so.  3. Lyrics included? Don't think so.  4. Exclusive photographs included? Don't think so.  5. Colorful cases for each CD? Don't think so. And it gets worse... Cases for Toto IV and Hydra... God, YOU CAN NOTICE THE PIXELS!  6. DVD? Don't think so.  7. VHS converted into DVD files without any remastering? Pretty much.    In the end, you shouldn't waste any money on this. You shouldn't buy this even if you don't have these records. It's not fair for us fans and for the band itself.      P.S.: By the way, the one star I gave is for the box itself, the only product here worth of being part of a Box-Set.
B002XUL85G|5.0|In this movie, there is not a lot of blow'em up stuff, car chases, fights, blood, and if those types of movies are for you, then read no further because you will be disappointed.    If you like good ol' horror movies, then read on. I loved this movie for the fact it was simple and puts you on the edge of your seat. My wife and I went to the movie theater and watched it we enjoyed it very much. This is a good date movie for a guy because if your girl gets scared, she could end up in your lap.     This is the best horror movie made since The Exorcist. That is saying a lot because there are a lot of good horror movies out there.     A must see for any horror movie fan!!!!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|At first I was annoyed at this release - packaging an album I already have with 8 new songs so I have to buy it again.  Then again, how many greatest hits albums do the same, but with only one, maybe two new songs?  And, these songs feel like part of \\"The Fame\\" instead of songs justifiably cut from that disc.  They're strong tracks worth having, and stand on their own.<br /><br />BAD ROMANCE is very catchy just like her first three hits from \\"The Fame.\\"  I found myself wanting to dance to it.  I also think it would be great for remixing.<br />ALEJANDRO sounds like a ripoff of Madonna's \\"La Isla Bonita\\" - with a beat so similar that I expected to find it mentioned in the liner notes!  That's not to say it isn't a very good song. It is excellent, and I could listen to it over and over.  In fact, the song made me think that Gaga could easily rise to the level Madonna reached with edgy music, great dance hits and a raw energy many pop stars lack.<br />MONSTER a good mid-tempo song with a familiar lyrical theme - the bad boy who isn't good for you but you just can't resist (like Cowboy Casanova, or other myriad songs).  It's easy to listen to and easy to sing along to.  A great addition to the EP.<br />SPEECHLESS I just didn't care for this one. But those that liked \\"Paparazzi\\" will probably enjoy it.  I think she does better with fast tracks than ballads.<br />DANCING IN THE DARK is a good midtempo song.<br />TELEPHONE is the real stand out.  A dance hit with an excellent techno beat that you find yourself nodding to without realizing it.  Beyonce brings something to the party without taking over.  Kind've like Gwen Stefani did for Eve on \\"Blow Ya Mind.\\"<br />SO HAPPY I COULD DIE is okay.  It's catchy, but in a way that quickly becomes annoying.<br />TEETH - you've just got to listen to for yourself.  Not going to be a radio hit, but definitely interesting.<br /><br />Overall, this was an excellent album and not too badly priced even if you already have \\"The Fame.\\"  Highly recommended to pop and Lady Gaga fans.fans.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I always enjoy remembering how I encountered Lady GaGa and her music. One day, a video was featured on YouTube, and it turned out to be her hit single 'Poker Face'. How many views did the video have at that time? Less than a thousand. Afterward, I encountered another video of hers: 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich'. This video wasn't that popular either, and I began to get the impression she was an up-coming artist. Eventually, I found out she was the mind behind the crazy club banger 'Just Dance'. I was surprised at the variety of music she was capable of performing, and I was also surprised her other singles weren't popping off like her first. I purchased her album 'The Fame' way before all of the GaGa madness came about, and I found the album to be very entertaining. While it had minor issues, it turned out to be a great album. Lady GaGa definitely had potential, but her first album barely scratched the surface of what she was capable of doing. After a year and a half of crazy piano covers and incredible performances, Lady GaGa has turned into an international pop-star. Her videos have several million views, and she has established her own identity as an artist. It's no surprise she has decided to release 'The Fame Monster' in what may be the peak of her popularity in pop-music.    Lady GaGa has insisted that this album isn't a re-release of her first album. I was a bit skeptical, especially since it was only eight tracks long and had a similar title. After picking up the album, I was absolutely taken off guard by the quality of the material. While the album is short in length, every track packs a punch and you'll have a difficult time removing it from your CD changer. 'The Fame Monster' is an album of its own, and it is the complete opposite of her original album. This time, we get a sense of 'humanity', and experience all of the different monsters that come with the fame...it's not all fun and games. We also get a glimpse of the life she left behind before she became apop-phenomenon. It's conception most definitely falls in line with flipping a coin: on one side you have 'The Fame' and on the other side you have 'The Fame Monster'.    Now, while this may be thematically opposite from her original album, it still maintains a similar style of music. GaGa has quickly matured as an artist, and she knows how to deliver the goods. Most of the tracks have an 80's feel to them, and the instrumentals and lyrics work beautifully together. The lead single 'Bad Romance' does set the mood for the album, and the song itself is a good indication as to whether you'll like the album or not. The songs, however, do maintain a good sense of variety.    One song in particular that stood out from the entire lot was 'Speechless', a song dedicated to her father who was suffering major heart conditions. Apparently, his refusal to have surgery prompted her in creating the song. The song is beautifully composed, and it's some of her best work to date. She incorporates beautiful vocals, with some gorgeous piano and old-school guitar. Her father ended up having surgery after hearing the song, which was pretty emotional.    But, not to worry...GaGa doesn't forget her roots. She still maintains the ability to make some intense club-type records, such as 'Telephone' featuring Beyoncé Knowles and a little darker hit like 'Monster'. Other songs such as 'Dance In The Dark', 'Alejandro' and 'So Happy I Could Die' display her talent of combining thematic lyrics with good up-beat/club instrumentals. She also finishes the album with a track called 'Teeth' , which more on the 'soul' side of things.    The overall album is excellent. Fans that think 'The Fame Monster' is just another re-release might be in for a surprise when they listen to the quality of the material. Lady GaGa demonstrates her incredible ability to compose thematic material that goes beyond 'pop' music. She has established her own identity as an artist, and she's not someone you can imitate easily. Her sophomore album solidifies her position as one of the best pop-artists today. Fans can expect great things from this album. It's up-beat- tempo, conception, and 80's feel make it some of her best work to date, surpassing her first album in quality. While the album is pretty short, it's still worth every buck. The album is available in a standard version with it's initial eight tracks, or a Deluxe Edition that includes her original album for a total of twenty tracks.    There's even a box-set coming out with strands of her hair...weird as hell...but I have to admit I'm digging her style.    Overall Rating: 9/10    Pros: Well though out thematic lyrics and album conception, incredible instrumentals, and a great variety of style within each individual track.    Cons: At eight tracks, this album ends too soon.
B002NWRMVS|2.0|I'm a huge Norah Jones fan. I simply love her voice. Overall I think her best CD was her first (Come Away With Me). I also feel there has been a steady downward direction of the subsequent CDs. In spite of the mixed reviews I bought this CD anyway because it is Norah Jones. I'm really disappointed. I understand that artists want to show a diversity to their craft. On this disk Norah gets lost in the supporting band. It's a different direction and to these ears it's the wrong direction. I am still a huge NJ fan, but moving forward I won't buy any new disks just because it's Norah. In the final analysis I'm giving The Fall two stars because it is Norah's voice, but I would return the disk and get my money back if I could.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|I managed to see these guys at Great Scott in Boston, MA - a divey little bar with maybe 100 other lucky patrons.  This band is the real deal.  They are tight, well-rehearsed, and were a blast to see.      Their songs are upbeat, catchy, poppy, and fun, with the exception of Soldier On, I suppose.  That song feels like something swept out from under David Bowie's dresser... not my favorite part of the album, as the vocals approach caterwaul range... but even with one miss, the album's batting .900.  And it's not even that Soldier On is BAD.  It's really creative and interesting, it just kinda doesn't jive with the rest of the options.  Dougy, the singer, is exceptionally talented.  Sometimes the artsy guys just have to get a little weird, I guess.    Temper Trap is at their best when they're energetic, and thankfully most of the album fits that bill.
B001TH28EO|5.0|This edition provides Brahms listening for every mood.  If you feel like hearing choral music, you can choose from several selections. If the day dictates chamber music, you can make a pick from those sections.  The organization is wonderful. It was a great decision to acquire this collection.
B000HIV0FY|4.0|This \\"novel\\" written as nothing but emails to and from the characters, is a very funny capturing of life in the ad business.  Though taking place in London, it is a 2000 version of \\"Mad Men.\\" Very funny, and it captures the characters oh so very well.
B002XUL85G|5.0|The title says it all. I guess the day time filming (where the camera twists and turns unstopably to where your eyeballs wanna bleed) is done that way to bring more authenticity to the idea to begin with. It does look much less fictional that way. So because the things portrayed in this movie are very real, I will give it 5 stars despite the 1st person camera twists.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|I have to admit that I'm new to the King Crimson material and this was the best ever way to get introduced to it.  It is just simply amazing that 40 year old music can sound this crisp and balanced, especially in the 5.1 mixes.  Steven Wilson has done a phenomenal job on these mixes, especially considering the reconstruction he had to go through from the original tapes to get it done.  This product is a beautiful marriage between 40 year old music that was ahead of its time, and a production/mix from a music genius that is ahead of its time as well in terms of surround 5.1 sound.    I have purchased the other Deluxe 5.1 version of King Crimson that have been made available:  Lizard and In the Court of King Crimson.  I can't believe I was never exposed to this magical, experimental and utterly creative music in the past, but this packaging is the best way I can think of getting introduced to it!   Highly recommended!
B002QY9RMA|5.0|If you have waited, like I did (because I knew she would re-release it again anyway), to buy Beyonce's 3rd solo LP, then this is definitely a great purchase! I really enjoyed this cd. But if you already own this album I wouldn't recommend buying it again. But it would make a great Christmas gift I suppose because it does contain great music
0762434279|1.0|This is NOT the real \\"Rich Dad - Poor Dad\\" book.  Just look at the photos I posted of it and you'll see the real size.  It's only 2 3/4\\" by 3 1/4\\" in size!  It does NOT contain all the text that the original book does.  It's a rip off!
0385532458|4.0|I am not a big fan of short stories but this book is very good.  As always John Grisham writes with such detail that you can see the stories come alive while you read.
B002X20W2E|5.0|I too like many of you have been waiting for this album all year, and I have to tell you it is worth the wait! I am a huge rihanna fan and have loved most of the things she has done on her albums in the past, and when I heard this album was to be much darker and edgier I was even more anxious to listen to it. The album is definately different than her previous but in a very good way. It shows just how much she has grown as an artist over the past years and how her vocal ability is up to par with some of the greats in the business. Love almost every song on the album.
0547258305|4.0|To be honest, I was expecting this to be another poorly written fantasy/romance about a teen girl with powers or who has fallen in love with a boy who has powers and is conflicted between having a normal life and pursuing love at the cost of leaving her previous life behind--the reluctant and conflicted main character...or even worse, narrator, and the highly predictable ending. I know that there are plenty of readers who long for exactly that kind of crap...I mean book...but not me.<br /><br />All of that said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Cashore's debut novel is not that kind of novel at all, but is, instead, the story of a complex character, told in 1st person narrative about the inner struggle between our inner animal and violent instincts and our desire to be civilized and human, or rather, humane. It's also an interesting commentary on the concept of meekness, which, in truth is not weakness but actually restrained strength. Katsa has to struggle with the ideology that just because one has the power to kill and maim, doesn't mean that one should.<br /><br />This applies as well to her thoughts regarding kings, that they should be for the people, not just men who abuse their state in life. Also, there is a parallel between Katsa's Grace and her ability to tame it, and King Leck's Grace and his malicious abuse of it that juxtaposes the two sides to the philosophy.<br /><br />Lastly, Cashore ended the novel in the perfect place, rather than a quick drop from the pinnacle of the climax, where Katsa kills King Leck. She resolves some of the open elements left in the book and continues to create interesting developments with the characters. I recommend this to all readers 15+.<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller, [...]

B001QWBM62|5.0|I've spent a little time with my new H4n and am convinced that it will get a lot of use from me; it is missing a couple of features I might have liked, but they don't affect my overall rating. My experience with multitracks include a Korg D1200, Roland VS 1680, and the Zoom PS02, PS04, H4 and now the H4n.     I wanted a portable, easy to use multitrack that can handle recording acoustic guitar and has easy transfer of files to my computer. The H4 was pretty good, but I ended up selling it; I think maybe it lacked the simplicity that the H4n has.     The built in condensers get some really nice sound, and the external jacks allow me to use any mic I want to use, or record any stereo sound with the 1/4\\" inputs.    The mixing options are limited (MTR mode) -- effects can only be added on input, and only one effect can be used at a time. But since I do my mixing on my computer, this is not a big problem for me; but since I do mix on my computer, the ability to drag and drop files is a huge plus.     Also, MTR mode can only use 16/44, not 24/96,like the other modes. This won't be a big hassle for me, but it might be worth mentioning for those who insist on 24 bit recording all the time.     So, this does what I wanted it to do, for the most part, and gets a high rating. It has some limitations that are not issues for me, so just know what you need and do your research.
0345308239|4.0|Though written before 1989, what this book, by a recognised and outstanding author, shows by its description of the facts leading to America's war in Vietnam is far more relevant today to the major issues of our Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It should be read by every American over 17 years old, if America is going to stop its suicidal march towards folly.
0061231401|1.0|My husband has read a few books by James Rollins and this was in my recommendations from Amazon, so I ordered it.  My husband said he couldn't even follow all the action at the end of the book.  Things going on in multiple places.  Too much.  He said \\"Don't get any more books by this author.\\"
B000066C1N|4.0|It got here quickly, and the CD worked well. The case was a little dirty and cracked but I was satisfied over all.
0740785508|5.0|This book doesn't really instruct you in how to draw or how to paint. And it doesn't particularly tap into the mysterious process of creativity.    What is DOES show is how this one, accomplished artist manages to take the crazy ideas in his head and eventually move them to the point where they are finished pieces of art. This includes stuff like intricacies of layout, the ways to use photo reference, sketching and how a sketch can function in a given composition. And there's artist nitty-gritty here too: information tools of the trade.    The advice on \\"starting with the familiar\\" is worth the price of the book alone.    Finally, this is a handsome book, loaded with color, with sufficiently large space for the illustrations and how-to stuff to live. The binding is solid and seems like it will hold up to a little man-handling and being opened really wide so it can be referred to in a studio. Not a cheapie!

B0026P3G12|4.0|First, let me begin by saying that no matter how much I love a voice, there will always be a song or songs they've done that just doesn't grab me. And I'd say 99.9% of the time, its really the arrangement that falls flat. That being said, though I found Susan Boyle's CD mostly wonderful, I didn't like the arrangement on Daydream Believer (way too slow), and The End of the World (arrangement was too skimpy and again a tad too slow). I wish she would've sung the whole song How Great Thou Art instead of just the refrain. After the 6th time, I fast forwarded to the next track.<br />But on the positive side, I loved every other song. Her voice was absolutely flawless in conveying her emotional connection to the particular piece. In other words, no head singing here, the heart was the center.<br />All in all, I'm glad I bought the CD and I hope for her all future success.She is truly an inspiration.

B002GYVRRI|5.0|Hello all. I need some help, please from those who have bought this version of \\"Red\\". The product description references DTS 5.1 surround only, not DVD-A (aka DVD-Audio). This $20.99 item doesn't mention DVD-Audio which I want. Conversely, the \\"In the Court of the Crimson King DELUXE\\" for $20.49 specifically states that there is a DVD-A disc.  This \\"Red\\" doesn't call itself \\"Deluxe\\" so I'm gunshy here.    Help! (Please!)    Thanks!
B002XUL85G|4.0|Getting sucked into all the hype is what killed Blair Witch for many people.  Both that movie and Paranormal Activity are great films if you can get the hype cloud out of your head.  I saw this in a pretty much empty theater and I think that really made it a great experience for me.  Some people's experience comes from the collective audience experience, so if that is you, then this might be another Blair Witch Project.    I would suggest to watch this movie in a dark, quiet room with a friend or two that can really appreciate it for what it is worth.  Crank up the volume - the quietness can be unnerving.
B0026P3G12|5.0|much anticipated cd, she nails it again with I dreamed a dream, has the same magic as when on BGT....i am surprised at some negative reviews, susan is not streisand, if you want that powerful a voice then check out the streisand cds....however susan holds her own on this cd, and if you like susan boyle you will like the cd.....    i am disappointed in \\"how great thou art\\", the vocals are good but the song consist only of the chorus over and over again...maybe this cd was put together and marketed so quickly they just werent thinking.    as susan is very good with cover songs, i look forward to her next album which i hope will consist of many covers songs i favor....    also \\"wild horses\\" i never liked that song, not until i heard susan sing it, great job.....    certainly is great when you can actually witness an underdog have the last laugh.....
1416594787|5.0|It is very sad that another book has to be written about such a subject, and yet I plan to read Jerry Coyne's book by the title \\"Why Evolution Is True,\\" not just for the praise Dawkins gives it in this book, but because Coyne gets at least as much, if not more, praise for his effort on the same front. It is a tragedy that it is still difficult to convince people of the power of evolution by natural selection, but it is only so because so many people never bother to understand what is being propounded.<br /><br />I know...I was once one of the fundamentalist Christians that rejected it. All I had to go on was the canned anti-intellectual responses of the religious right. I see many of my former compatriots giving one-star reviews to this book without even reading it, but that is the way it is with that group. I realize that most people that accept it do so without understanding it, as well. That was something I could not do, so I did read \\"On the Origin of Species\\" by Darwin, and many other books and articles on the subject since then. The real tragedy is that most people, accepting the science or not, never even care to try to understand the amazing way we developed into so many species out of likely only one.<br /><br />Aside from having one of the most beautiful jackets I have ever seen, and some extraordinary color picture sections added for clarity, this book contains the following sections:<br /><br />1. Only a theory?<br />2. Dogs, cows, and cabbages<br />3. The primrose path to macro-evolution<br />4. Silence and slow time<br />5. Before our very eyes<br />6. Missing link? What do you mean, 'missing'?<br />7. Missing persons? Missing no longer<br />8. You did it yourself in nine months<br />9. The ark of the continents<br />10. The tree of cousinship<br />11. History written all over us<br />12. Arms races and 'evolutionary theodicy'<br />13. There is grandeur in this view of life<br /><br />Appendix: The history-deniers<br /><br />The appendix could be readbefore or after the book, and is a general overview of polls that have been taken in the U.S. and Europe regarding the beliefs of the general population with regard to evolution and creationism. Needless to say, it is depressing, but what do you expect when you're talking about polls of the general population? As he points out, about 20% of the general population think the earth goes around the sun in a month, clearly having no idea what a year is. I'm sure a percentage would still think the earth was flat if the question was put forward.<br /><br />I think most of the chapter headings speak for themselves. Chapter one discusses the nature of scientific theory, hypothesis, etc, because of the claim of so many that evolution is only a theory, forgetting all about little things such as gravitational theory, germ theory, etc. Chapter two and three slowly take us into the world of evolutionary change with examples we cannot deny. Chapter four discusses how we measure the age of the earth, strata, and fossils by means of geological clocks. Chapter five gives examples we can see in our lifetime, rather than just depending on the fossils of ages. Chapter six discusses the logical fallacy of missing links, while chapter seven goes specifically into transitional fossils within the human species. Chapter eight goes into the crucial subject of embryology, where most of the evolutionary changes to genes have the greatest effect. Chapter nine explains plate tectonics, formerly known as continental drift, and its importance to the spread of various early forms. Chapter ten discusses the common ancestry of all species, with many examples given of homologous structures. Chapter eleven covers the traces of historical evolutionary steps that can be seen in the modern forms that exist, such as vestigial organs. Chapter twelve talks about the pain and suffering inherent in the evolutionary view, and the problem that presents for many. Chapter thirteen goes deeply into Charles Darwin'sfamous quote at the end of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" and discusses it at length, breaking it up line by line.<br /><br />Here is that quote, which is one of the most beautiful quotes concerning life:<br /><br />\\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"<br /><br />There is another quote I would like to put down in this review, from the book being reviewed.<br /><br />\\"Information on how to handle the present so as to survive into the future is necessarily gleaned from the past.\\" -- Richard Dawkins, The Greatest Show on Earth, 2009, pg 406.<br /><br />I think this book should have been more carefully argued, and in much more detail, which is why I still think \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" first edition, is one of the best books one can read, since Darwin was such a careful and precise thinker -- but for a modern perspective, one cannot do much better than combining Darwin's work with Dawkins' work.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Absolutely a must for avid Dylan fans! Plus simply a delightful new take on traditional favorites.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Inglourious Basterds is, without a doubt, Tarantino's masterpiece.  In fact, not to jinks him or wish him anything but the best in future endeavors, but it is my opinion the odds of him surpassing what he has achieved in this film are slim indeed.      While there have been numerous complaints (even in the most complimentary of reviews) of the many incongruous elements found throughout the film, I have found it is the very disparity of those elements that tie this film into a unifying whole - and precisely what makes it one of the most satisfactory films and satisfying movie experiences of 2009.  It is this genre-busting, \\"what is it?\\" quality that makes it unique among the major players of this year's top films.      Visually, Tarantino has done nothing to date that quite matches the opulence he achieves here a tailor made look evocative of the \\"Grand Hollywood Style\\" of those glorious Technicolor epics of the 50's, 60's and 70's.  Like those, every frame of \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" seems worthy of being reproduced as \\"art\\" in its own right.  The color spectrum he employs throughout is rich and vivid in that 1950's fashion - simultaneously lurid yet beautiful.      He elicits performances from his cast that are among the most memorable seen in years.  The arc of the Shoshana story - Melanie Laurent in a powerfully searing performance that throbs with a ferocious intensity, anchors the various chapters of the film brilliantly.  That performance is matched (and maybe even surpassed) by her chief tormentor, in the guise of Austrian actor Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa of the SS.  Waltz, in fact, makes one of the most amazing film debuts in American film history.  Chilling doesn't begin to describe his performance here.    Not to be outdone by her costars, Diane Kruger gets to star in one of Tarantino's most brilliantly conceived scenes from any of his films - the basement bar scene.  As the unlikely (and hilariously) named Bridget Von Hammersmark, Kruger gives her finest performance since Joyeux Noel and proves herself both as comedian and grand tragedienne.      The Basterds - headed by Brad Pitt - have found some critics singling theirs out to be the weakest element of the movie, but I disagree.  Strongly.  While the danger of the European war front can be elegantly confusing throughout the entire film (e.g., the almost Andrew Wyeth spareness of the opening chapter; the inviting danger of the basement bar; the opulence of the Cinetheque, etc.) the sheer audacity and brutality of the scenes with the Basterds adds a provocatively American feel to the story's proceedings.      The Basterds are almost a comic chorus line -  not quite interchangeable archetypes in a film otherwise populated with specific and memorable characters.  Of course several of them (including Mr. Pitt) get to partake in a finale that is (even by Tarentino standards) so over the top it is nothing if not jaw dropping.  The entire finale offers one of the most hauntingly beautiful and memorable scenes modern cinema has had to offer in a very long time.      Mr. Tarantino paints all of this onto the broadest canvas possible using a palette that combines the almost unseemly mixtures of film noir, slapstick, crude comedy, art house film, historical fiction, James Bond-style slickness, buddy pic and action flick seemingly without a fleeting concern as to what anybody else thinks.  It's a \\"take no prisoners\\" style of filmmaking that (clearly) does not play to all tastes and demands that it be taken on its own terms.  If one is willing to take that journey with him the rewards are remarkable and immeasurable.  A truly remarkable film achievement.  Bravo, Signor Tarantino!
0425166805|4.0|Chariots of the Gods is a fascinating read, whether you agree with Daniken's hypothesis or not.  He simply is asking questions no one has asked before, questioning long held beliefs by actually examining them.      This book is not for anyone who wishes to avoid engagement in thought and analysis of history and preconceived ideas.  Danikens belief that alien life forms visited earth during the earliest stages of human developement is simply his attempts to answer the \\"how\\" & \\"why\\" that many scholars have either ignored or hidden behind the veil of religion.    I personally believe that Daniken's view is valid in forcing a more honest discussion of the destructive history of organized religion.  He is also pushing for a re-examination of established assumptions using modernized techniques and tools, which is a common scientific practice.       Simply put Chariots of the Gods is highly engaging, fascinating and worth reading.  If you are searching for answers, avoid this book. If you are comfortable with asking questions and challenging assumptions, pick this up you will not be disappointed.
B002UXRH10|3.0|Rihanna came out true to her roots.  She was gorgous, sweet, real, honest and made music that was honest.  Her sound was a warm mix of Dancehall and R-N-B that many mainstream music fans would appriciate.  Good Girl Gone Bad changed the direction which kept much of the same subject matter in tact, but she seemed to become more of a product that was being increasingly directed by her record label.  This new album unfortunately is her weakest.  I can only imagin her record label monopolizing off of her, chosing producers, sound, style, direction, etc.  The album is loaded with lackluster production that sounds alot like the watered down garbage on the radio.  Why Rihanna's recognizable voice is still in tact, a considerable amount of the subject matter and lyrics simply do not sound like they are coming from her heart.  Pop, Dance, and commerical R-N-B are the driving sounds of the record.  To fans who have supported her from the beginning (like myself), this album may come off as a dissappointment.  There are about 5 songs that truely show Rihanna's vocal ability that also show what sounds like her soul.  Also, why is the album labeled with an Explict Lyrics sticker?  It seems like yet another ploy from the record label to make her like everyone else.  Hopefully things fall into place during this era of her career and she will gain control of her musical style and journey and begin making music that reflects the person that she is and not the marketable character her record label wants her to be.  Stand up for yourself Rihanna.  Don't allow yourself to be a product and don't forget the people that supported you to get you where you are today.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this DOES NOT HAVE the behind-the-scenes footage that the DVD does.  My friend who has the DVD set kept telling me about the cool behind the scenes where they show how they got the footage, so I was expecting that when I got the Blu-Ray set.  Boy was I surprised!  Why wouldn't you include it BBC?  It was a big disappointment.  I could have just downloaded the HD versions from the internet and, not including the Blu-Ray menus, it would have been pretty much the same.  The extras are what make buying the actual set worth it (apart from a clear conscience).    Having said that, the video quality is great (there are a few shots not in HD though) and the footage that they got is amazing!    Also, I did get this from Amazon but I got my friend to order it for me because he has Amazon Prime shipping.

B002NXSSBU|1.0|UPDATE:  I used to agree with two stars, but now one.  The artwork, while an attempt to recreate the LP, is stretched.  So glad I jumped off the AF train!!  __________________________________________________________________________________________    I actually think the packaging is pretty cool as it recreates the style of the original LP.  However, I rip all of my CDs to FLAC, so I don't need to take the disc out every time I want to hear the music.  The packaging almost made me think AF was kicking it up a notch and starting to release some high quality products.  That was prior to discovering the clipped peaks on this disc.    I was a member on Steve Hoffman's forum (under the name Dream Operator) and I noticed posts from people wondering if this release sounded better than the Dennis Drake master.  I decided to put up some samples from this version so people could get an idea of the sound.  I opened the first track (True Blue) in a sound editing program and created a 30 second sample.  Then I opened the second track (Lost Paraguayos) to make a sample of that.  It was then that I noticed the end of the song had consistently leveled peaks.  I zoomed in and found the peaks are actually clipped (flat-topped).  Other songs on the album have clipped peaks as well, but Lost Paraguayos was the worst offender.    I sent Steve Hoffman a private message about this (after issues with other discs, he asked me to contact him about AF issues in the future)and he told me they don't have peak limiters at RTI.  He said he would have his copy in a week.    I then emailed Marshall Blonstein (President of Audio Fidelity), but I did not receive a reply.  After a few days, I posted on Steve Hoffman's forum about the clipped peaks.  The post was mild and did not make any accusations.  The post was removed in less than a minute and I was soft banned (my account appears active, but I cannot access anything on the site when I log in).      I sent another email to Marshall [...], but thistime I received a reply from Heather.  She said he was out of the country and would be returning on Monday (11/16/2009).  I sent Marshall another email on 11/19 and asked if he had a chance to read my previous email and asked what his thoughts were.  I still have not received a reply.    I don't think the disc sounds bad and the dynamic range is quite good.  However, the disc does not live up to the promise on their website: \\"The original dynamic range of the recordings are not maximized, brickwalled, limited or compressed in any way during remastering.\\" (also printed on all previous AF CDs, though slightly different).  Clipped peaks are the result of some type of compression.  Whether it was a peak limiter or perhaps the analog-to-digital converters were simply over-driven by accident, I do not know.    This is the third CD from Audio Fidelity's 2009 releases to reveal compression (The Doors - The Soft Parade and The Pretenders - The Pretenders being the other two discs).  Sad for that company that attempts to build their reputation on producing albums without additional compression.     For the record, Kevin Gray is credited for remastering this, not Steve Hoffman.  Steve was credited for the other two Audio Fidelity discs that have compression.  These guys appreciate dynamic music, so it's hard to say why these issues are happening.      [...]

B0026P3G12|5.0|A 5-star album that stands on its own merits.  I almost held my breath in anticipation as I started to listen, wondering...hoping....praying....that it would be good.  One reviewer commented on the orchestration.  For me, it was a welcome addition and variation mixed with the more simply accompanied pieces.  Not only was this album good, it was GREAT!  Everything about this album was wonderful, the song choices and order, the flow of the music, the arrangements, and above all, Susan's beautiful, at times haunting, but always musical voice.  I listened to the album straight through and was left happy and content, though wanting to hear more.  This album is the perfect Christmas gift and I will be buying more.

B000N39HOE|5.0|I bought this thinking I was getting the Limited Numbered Edition set. Everything about it appeared as though that is what I was getting. The Amazon image clearly shows \\"Limited Numbered Edition\\", however when i received it, that wording was nowhere to be found.  I checked on Proprius' website and found this item in their catalog, where it specifically showed the same image, and mentioned the worldwide limit to 3000 copies. It is catalog #PRSACD 7879.  PRSACD 7879 is indeed what is on the jacket of what I received from Amazon.    So I began to wonder if there was just an outer jacket on it covering the real box that does say \\"Limited Numbered Edition\\" and the pressing #. But concerned I wouldn't be able to return it once it was opened, I called Amazon CS...while I'm not completely sure the CS rep I spoke to completely understood me, I explained my situation and concern and she said to go ahead and open it and if its not what I ordered I could return and recieve a full refund no problem. So while I was on the phone with her I did just that....    I was disappointed. There is no indication that this is a Numbered edition in any way shape or form. The only Number on it is the Catalog # and the UPC code.    Unfortunately I will be sending this back. I will be ordering the proper Numbered edition from elsewhere.  I'd love to have just gotten it right the first time or to at least get a new one sent to me, but something tells me that Amazon does NOT have this in the numbered edition and that I would just be going through this exercise all over again.    Because this is not the limited edition, that might explain why it was on pre-order status and only just released on Nov 17th 2009, when in fact this has been on the market for a few years now.  Proprius probably released this as a not so limited release.    So if you don't care about this being a limited #'ed edition, then go for it.    I rated it 5/5 stars simply because the product itself simply deserves that based on the overwhelming reviews I've read elsewhere. It does not deserve a ding because Amazon is not selling the right version. Hopefully they will correct the image if they expect to avoid many returns and disappointed customers.

B0026P3G12|2.0|I was mesmerized by Susan Boyle's adventure, and optimistic that under the wing of Simon Cowell she would blossom --  but this first effort falls sadly flat and bland. It's too safe, it's too even, and even the tempos are too similar from track to track.<br /><br />Boyle has a terrific voice, but this is an opportunity missed -- instead of being a Saturday night explosion, it's like a tepid Sunday afternoon tea party.<br /><br />I'd like to see her really declare a genre --  probably standards --  and get her spirit back into the recordings. Doing the Rolling Stones was a clever idea, but it comes across as a funeral dirge.<br /><br />Give this woman a real music director and let her rip.

0739365894|4.0|I listened to this book on Cd and I enjoyed it very much. I didn't know that Reacher is a character in a series so I can't compare this book to others. The writing gave me such vivid pictures of the characters and the places that they went. Reacher is a real tough guy and I enjoyed his exploits. I did find some slow spots in the story towards the end and some politics that I didn't want to have to get into during a story. Also, I thought that his female cop buddy was too one dimensional. Despite the small negatives, I was always eager to hear what was coming next and I will have to get some of the other books in the series.    Favorite line- \\"The Canadian army? It's just three men and a dog\\".

B002BNKQDK|5.0|I purchased this fantastic box-set and got it delivered to New Zealand. It came in perfect condition and about 8 days ahead of the listed delivery date. Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Now onto the product. This amazing set contains the Director cut of the film on the first disc, special features on the second disc and a digital copy on the third. All of the discs fit nicely into the base of the figure. What is even better is that discs one and two are region free which meant I can play them from across the globe! (NOTE: I haven't tested the digital copy disc but I believe you must be an America citizen to activate it)<br /><br />Now the collectors item of the pack is made out of plastic but it feels sturdy. The Nite Owl's ship even detaches from the base, lights up AND makes the noise of the ship! If that doesn't make you want to buy it I don't know what will!<br /><br />It ended up costing me about NZ$114 which I think is very reasonable.
0385504225|3.0|This book is an OK read. As usual with Dan Brown books, it acquaints you with some new disciplines and novel information, and in this instance, tells you a great deal about the traditions behind the Masons and how they relate to Washington DC and the founding fathers. I do genealogy research, and many of my family were Masons, so I found this interesting. But this book rambles--A LOT. There are long-winded dialogs from the bad guy's point of view. Long-winded explanations and then some key points glossed over. I could have edited 100 pages out of this book and made it better, and no one would have missed what I cut.

Yea we all have this music but not all her videos, b-sodes, remixes, pictures. i think that it is exciting. they should of just released the deluxe because the standard is very unessecary. It would be better if this included the 3 video, boys video, and overprotected video. i dont get why they didnt release those in the set. get it!!!
B000002IVF|5.0|Here, David Crosby claims his place in the upper tier of velvet-voiced, romantic singers of our generation, contemporarily equaled possibly only by Art Garfunkel.  I'm so glad Crosby make this record, I can hardly contain my enthusiasm!  Previous to this lovely collection of music, we've heard David Crosby as intelligent rocker with mostly only glimpses of his quieter vocal subtleties, which bloom in full here.    \\"Too fast for comfort   too low to fly   too young to die.\\"    That's David Crosby for you.    Listen to this record.  It's a treat.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|For a small price more you definitely want the deluxe version to get the extra sound tracks.  Great music and easy listening.  Makes you recall the movie if you ever saw it.
B0026P3G12|3.0|By now, you should all know who Susan Boyle is, and if not, what rock have you been living under? At last, we get her long awaited dedut, and despite handwritten CD liner notes (where she tells us why she picked what song and what it means to her), you just know that a certain Mr Cowell had something to do with the safe choices and song arrangements.<br /><br />The title track is \\"I dreamed a dream\\", the song she performed on the show \\"Britain's got talent\\" and blew everyone away with, but it sounds more restrained on CD.<br /><br />The CD comprises ballads, from her version of the Rolling Stones' \\"Wild horses\\", \\"Cry me a river\\", the Monkees \\"Daydream believer\\", to some hymns, \\"How great thou art\\", \\"Up to the mountain\\" (the best vocal performance on the CD), \\"Amazing grace\\", and \\"Silent night\\", they are all impeccably sung, and the piano/string arrangements are tender and earnest, but everything tends to bleed into each other. I mean, 72 year old Shirley Bassey just released a spectacular CD of ballads, so it's not like I don't like ballads. In Shirley's case, her album comprised compositions by current singers/songwriters like Richard Hawley, KT Tunstall, Pet Shop Boys and Rufus Wainwright, so that probably lent the songs that extra X factor.<br /><br />The lone original song is the sweeping piano ballad \\"Who I was born to be\\" which sounds in places like the power ballad \\"The power of love\\" (Jennifer Rush, Celine Dion) with semi-biographical lyrics and a nice backing choir.<br /><br />Standout has got to be her version of Madonna's \\"You'll see\\", which largely stays true to the original, but with Boyle's spectacular vocals taking the song places Madonna could never go. The lyrics about being sidelined and maligned seem written for her and she feels it.<br /><br />A pleasant and harmless CD for fans of musical theatre or Barbra Streisand which will be sure to sell millions. I am truly glad her dream has come true, and just hope for her sake that most of those saying this CD is the best thing since sliced bread will still be buying her music 3 CDs down the line, when all the Cowell induced hysteria has died down. 3 and a half stars!read will still be buying her music 3 CDs down the line, when all the Cowell induced hysteria has died down. 3 and a half stars!

B002UXRH10|5.0|\\"The wait is over\\" Rihanna intones repeatedly on track 2 of her new CD \\"Rated R\\" and indeed it is. The track in question is \\"Wait your turn\\", a dark sounding downbeat song with synth and guitar flourishes. And so ends the two and a half year wait for a new Rihanna CD (which seems longer as zillions of singles were culled off her last CD).<br /><br />With a Hip Hop feel is \\"Hard\\" (featuring Young Jeezy) with booming beats, and the skeletal \\"Rockstar 101\\" (similar to, but much more tuneful than Beyonc&eacute;'s \\"Diva\\") with squealing Rock quitars courtesy of Slash. The bouncy \\"Rude boy\\" is an incredibly catchy Caribbean-inflected scorcher, sure to get one moving on the dance floor.<br /><br />If you're expecting another \\"Umbrella\\" or \\"Disturbia\\", you may be disappointed as the album is rather dark, atmospheric, and more experimental than its predecessor. It may not sell as well as \\"Good girl gone bad\\", but it is certainly a stronger album.<br /><br />Lyrically, she comes out throwing punches, harder (swearing in places), more mature and alluding to the elephant in the room (Chris Brown) in places (\\"My new nickname is 'You Idiot' .../That's what my friends are calling me when they see me yelling into my phone.\\" she sings on the beautiful piano ballad \\"Stupid in love\\", or \\"I lick the gun when I'm done, because I know that revenge is sweet.\\" from the erie and experimental \\"G4L\\".<br /><br />\\"Fire bomb\\" starts off with a driving Rock guitar riff but is really a pretty but choppy ballad which wouldn't sound out of place on a Pink disc. \\"Photographs\\" has a sublime and hypnotic Pop feel and features will.i.am (as well as woozy flourishes). \\"Te amo\\" is a gyrating Latin-tinged number, \\"Cold case love\\" is a melodramatic ballad with a brilliant snarling guitar coda, while closing is the heartfelt piano ballad \\"The last song\\" (again with biting guitars).<br /><br />Absolute standout is the Ne-Yo co-penned ballad \\"Russian roulette\\" (with creepy sounding piano, a beautiful wall of harmonies, and lyrics about domestic violence), arguably the best thing she's done to date. The song ends with the bang of a gun shot, and Rihanna is indeed back with a bang!), arguably the best thing she's done to date. The song ends with the bang of a gun shot, and Rihanna is indeed back with a bang!
B001AVCFK6|4.0|You get a lot for your money with the Blu-ray set.  Even the regular DVD set that includes the bonus digital copy gives you a lot of bang for your buck.  The movie itself, however, is fun but far from perfect.<br /><br />The film opens with a scene that almost caused me to walk out on the movie at the theaters --- a scene with a key character's wife going into labor at just the wrong moment, and it shows her being hurriedly attended to as everything comes crashing down around her.  If there is a more over-used cliche in cinema, I don't know what it could be.  I remember rolling my eyes during this scene and thinking that if this is the level of originality we can expect in this film, this is going to be painful to sit through.<br /><br />Then later in the film, Kirk is ejected from the Enterprise onto some sort of ice planet.  But this being a movie, he lands pretty much right next to a cave where \\"old Spock\\" just happens to be (and for different reasons -- he wasn't placed there to aid Kirk) and they just happen to be walking distance from an Starfleet Academy outpost.  With the outpost so nearby, it makes one wonder why Spock chose to remain in the cave and hadn't gone there already.  Hmmm.  Again, big ice planet....and Kirk just HAPPENS to land near Spock and the outpost.  Convenient and a wild coincidence, eh?  That's Hollywood for you!  Writers must get paid by the cliche, I guess.<br /><br />And there are plenty of other examples in this movie where logic and common sense took a backseat to production design (cough cough -- interior design of Nero's ship -- cough cough), but I'll let those go for now.<br /><br />Aside from the plentiful in-jokes, this \\"Star Trek\\" is nothing more than sufficiently enjoyable.  It is decent enough fun, but not so much as to warrant the fawning it has received from certain fans.<br /><br />In fact, I would suspect that certain hard-core fans would like this movie LESS than some of the more casual and less-demanding fans of the franchise.<br /><br />But it's just a movie, folks.  Either you'll like it or you won't.  You might be the kind who buys it out of a sense of fanbase loyalty but never watches it more than once or twice.  It won't enhance your life and it won't degrade it either.  It's just a movie.<br /><br />Unless, of course, you are one of the folks predisposed to LOVING it (or hating it) simply because it exists., folks.  Either you'll like it or you won't.

B0008ENHUI|4.0|The late Steve McQueen sure had a run of good luck with iconic roles like \\"Bullit\\", \\"The Sand Pebbles\\" (his only Oscar nomination), \\"The Getaway\\" and this epic tale which paired him for the first and only time with Dustin Hoffman whom I believe was playing a composite of 2 characters that Henri Carriere had encountered while imprisoned. Character actor that he is, I think Hoffman did a great job but this is McQueen's movie all the way.  In an interview with Larry King, Hoffman felt that McQueen was vastly under-rated like Clint Eastwood because he played \\"close to the vest\\".  In otherwards, in his element which were \\"action roles\\" like this or \\"The Getaway\\", \\"Bullit\\"--he was excellent.  But put him in a classical mode like Ibsen's \\"Enemy of the People\\" or Shakespeare--and he appears wooden or lost.  This film and \\"The Towering Inferno\\" was probably the last decent films that McQueen made--forget about \\"Tom Horn\\" or \\"The Hunter\\".  If you're a McQueen fan,do check this one out since it boasts excellent direction from Franklin Schaffner (Patton, Planet of the Apes) and a rousing score from Jerry Goldsmith plus a fine supporting cast which includes frequent cohort, Don Gordon (Bullitt), William Smithers, Anthony Zerbe and Victor Jory.  Now all that's needed is that it should be released in Blu-ray!!
B002LK3DUQ|3.0|Another commendable, 4-star outing from Pixar.  The DVD packaging is another matter. There have been many complaints about the computer-incompatibility, but my gripe is about the \\"pecking order\\" for those that want the single-disc DVD vs. the 4-disc Blu-ray and everything in-between.  Time was when you bought a 2-disc set of a Pixar film, you got hours worth of neat, entertaining and enlightening extras (example: the exhaustive Super Heroes guide with \\"The Incredibles\\"). By the time \\"Cars\\" came out, you could only get a single-disc version with very few extras. \\"Ratatouille\\": same story. \\"Wall-E\\" somewhat rectified the situation with the available 3-disc version, which did have generous bonuses - if you shelled out the bucks, that is. \\"Up\\" has the most deceptive packaging of all: a bare-bones single-disc version (you just want the movie and a lot of promos? You got it!), the \\"deluxe\\" DVD version (which Amazon/Disney advertise as a \\"Two-Disc Deluxe Edition + Digital Copy\\", which can imply there are three discs [there are not], and there are certainly NOT \\"hours of new bonus! [sic]\\", as the slip-sleeve boasts), and a 4-disc Blu-ray version for those fortunate enough to own that format. Disney is obviously hard-balling the recession-weary public into buying Blu-ray players and their inflated-priced discs and punishing those who are scraping by with an archaic DVD.  What would have been nice is an extras-packed double-DVD w/o the digital copy (I don't know anybody who really uses this), a better-valued single-DVD version and maybe even a single-Blu-ray.  The release date for a Pixar movie used to be an event. Now it's a downer, waiting to see how Disney rips its faithful public off again.
B000002897|4.0|I had this CD when it first came out and loved it. Over the years I lost the CD and had to get a replacement. If you like the grunge rock sounds of the 90's you will like Screaming Trees the singers voice is very deep and at times has a Urge Overkill sound to it. The music is tight and the song Nearly Lost You(track 2) did get some national attention with radio air play and MTV video(MTV used to play videos LOL). Overall I would have to say this band was over looked by many and definately deseved more media attention than they received. Hope this review was helpful.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Crazy Love is the first Michael Buble CD I've purchased.  It will not be the last.  His voice, the arrangements, overall one of them most listenable music presentations in years, in my opinion.  The mixture of old standards with new tunes is something that other singers would do well to emulate.  I particularly liked the way he sings \\"You're nobody till somebody loves you.\\"  I loved \\"Crazy Love\\" too. His voice goes from sexy to sweet, which I find delightful.    In fact, there is nothing on this CD to dislike.    I give it 5 stars.  I can't wait to buy my next one.
B001JNNE64|4.0|Awesome movie, awesome director's cut.  But I give it 4 stars because the \\"digital copy\\" is only for Windows Media player, and was not very clear on the cover that it was for Windows operating system only. So now I bought this copy + a copy off of iTunes......
B000VE439Y|5.0|Of all Monty Python movies, I think 'Life of Brian' is overshadowed by the Holy Grail. I've watched this movie so many times and it still cracks me up every time.
0980921066|5.0|How many times can Scrooge fail at just being human? He seems talented at it. Ah, but there is hope. He is visited by four spirits, all compelled to motivate change.<br /><br />The specter of his business partner, Jacob Marley, presents himself as the transforming face on Scrooge's doorknocker. Scrooge dismisses the image. Marley appears again, this time he is dragging a heavy chain: \\"The specter raised a cry and shook its chains and wrung its shadowy hands. I wear the chain I forged in life...I made it link by link, and yard by yard.\\"<br /><br />Scrooge is not convinced. No problem. The night is young, and the haunting is just beginning.<br /><br />Who has not failed at something and yearned for another opportunity? Who has not made a fool of oneself at least once and longed to erase it? Who has not hurt someone, somehow, and not yearned to be forgiven? Scrooge represents fallen humanity in desperate need of a savior and salvation.<br /><br />At the age of 12, some sources say 10, Charles Dickens labored for 12 hours a day, six days a week in a boot factory finishing the bottles of boot polish. On the seventh day he visited his family at the Marshalsea debtors' prison. This lasted for two grueling years--a traumatic expanse of time for the young Dickens. He never forgot it, yet, he used his pain to create memorable characters like Scrooge and Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit's crippled little boy.<br /><br />The 48 illustrations in this edition are a fabulous addition to this wonderful Christmas tale. They were drawn by various artists from the Victorian era, and bring Dickens' timeless characters to life.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I watched this movie when it came out and it's one movie I had to own. I recommend it to all my friends all the time.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I couldn't wait for her CD to be released and I was not disappointed. The soft vocals and feelings are there in every note. I didn't think it was possible but her voice and harmony has gotten even better now that she's in a professional recording studio. It was well worth the wait and I'm ready for her next CD. I hope it will also have a few songs that are just her own originals. I know there have to be a song writer or two that would love to have her voice make them famous as well. Get writing as I can't wait for the next CD. Susan... you've got talent!
0385341008|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry, and I was so sorry when I had finished it -- I wanted it to go on forever!  I'm recommending it to all my friends.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|The two Met's DVDs, 2009 by Netrebko and 1982 by Sutherland, are played back to back.  Bel Canto or not, Netrebko's voice is passionate and highly credible.  Her acting comes across fabulous on DVDs.  Her facial expressions are well synchronized with her beautiful singing.  Her Mad Scene is outstanding.   In my memory, it is the best Mad Scene since another Anna half a century ago.  That was Moffo.  Beczala, while already an international star, could be a household name before long.  I prefer Villazon and his robust voice.  The Netrebko-Villazon chemistry is hard to match.  Zimmerman does a superb job on the background scenaries (simple photos in Scotland), but the photographer and the injection can be done without.  A strong plus is having Dessay serving as hostess.  She is wonderful.  I wish she sings couple short notes.      Sutherland is vocally calculating as an old pro.   Lucia is more about passion and less about a canary singing contest.  She is not cut out for DVDs.   Her facial expression, if any, does not convey her emotions.... unlike Netrebko.   Krauss is superb, as always.  This is a three star DVD.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I don't know what you idiots who give 1 star are listening to.  I can only think you live your life to give negative reviews.  Susan Boyle is phenomenal.  This album is a great collection of songs that shows off her voice and I believe is just an introduction to what Susan has in store for us in the future. GO Susan!!
B0026P3G12|2.0|Susan seems to be something of a cultural Rorschach test on which people tend to give excessively impassioned answers the way they sometimes express how contemptuous they are of iceberg lettuce.  Her most impassioned fans may doubt that the author of a two-star review was completely swept up in the emotional response to her first appearance on BGT, but they would be wrong.  That performance was absolute magic.  There is no question that the situation and Susan's persona were a big part of it, but I remain convinced that the performance itself was magical.<br /><br />There is no magic for me in this album.  I will not pose as a music critic and try to analyze what is wrong with it and, in fact, find it so unappealing that I could not bear to listen again and try to understand what went so badly wrong.  So my attitude can be dismissed as merely subjective opinion, which it is.  But I would have loved for the Cinderella story to continue.<br /><br />We've seen enough now of Susan to know that there is a real human person underneath that dowdy, hugable wackiness in which we first knew her, a human being who has suffered hugely in her cramped life and who is far from being an angel in a frumpy frock.  But I love her (an affection that is easy to sustain from a great distance) and am very grateful for the uplifting episode that she provided for us.  I wish all the best for her.  Her celebrity is so great and her talents substantial enough that -- worst case -- she should be able to live the rest of her life as something of a queen.  I hope she finds great joy in it.  Maybe, with a new producer, she can even recapture some of the magic.  But for now, it is just a nostalgia thing.
1594488916|2.0|Please read \\"  J. Champlin \\"JohnSF \\" two star review.  His observations and thoughts mirror my own.      She comes across as naive and depending on your ethics and morals, an accomplice after the fact or at least an enabler.  I would NOT want her as a friend or neighbor.      At 288 pages, it is about 150 pages too long.. please note that the book is small.. and it starts to get tedious very fast.    I wish I had read J. Champlin's review before I bought it.    Going forward I, too, will avoid Ms Barlett's future writings.    Alex
0307454541|5.0|The twisting, detailed plot holds your interest as it builds to a crescendo. It is well written, A little boggy in the beginning. Character development is rich; you understand and want to be these characters as you become familiar with them
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Finally a mood for winter. Christmas and so much more. Living in Southern California we need all the help we can get believing that it is winter. Sting's \\"if On A Winter's Night...\\" is an excellent choice to get one through this season. It does get better and better. No putting away on Christmas afternoon.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I didnt know how much of a fan I was of Michael Jacksons until he passed. Now I cant stop watching his videos and interviews on You Tube. And knowing he isnt in this world is so sad. \\"This is it\\",is so great and I cant wait to own it. I just wish they had showed him upclose and personal more.
B000OT6UZQ|4.0|I loved this movie in High School and I still love it today.  On Blu-ray absolutely everything looks great.  And of course it is always  fun to see Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joshua Jackson (that's right, he is in this!) out of their usual roles.  Love it!
B002MU4NL8|5.0|As soon as I got the blu ray, I watched it twice! Both times, the scene with the theriminian dying, brought a tear to me eye!
0316069906|5.0|This is an excellent read!  It combines all the things I love about J.S. Foer with an issue I am very passionate about.  I have read a lot of books about factory farming and animal rights, but this one brings a literary feel and a new perspective.  I could pass this along to non-vegan friends and not see the eyes roll.
B000002UC5|5.0|This album has some of the most beautiful songs ever written, from \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" to \\"Junk\\".  McCartney's voice is so magnificent--I never get tired of listening to this album!
B000002C4J|1.0|i bought this item but it was never shipped to me. the seller will not write me back to tell me what happened so i don't know if i was refunded or if it's on it's way or what. i want it to get here already and i'm very dissatisfied that it's taking so long. i love the album. i have it as a cassette tape and i just wanted the cd. i never even received a confirmation email that it's been shipped or anything.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|As a musician, I was absolutely stunned when continum came out. I thought mayer's previous work, while good, didn't compare with the emotion that seemed to be an underlying theme in each track. With Battle studies, I don't see the same emotion, but i still feel the passion. I feel the pop sound that was, without a doubt, because of the music industry's corporate side. But I also can see in each song John Mayer's songwriting skills laid out beautifully. I agree with some of the reviews saying that this album is just \\"enjoyable.\\" But if you dissect each song, you can see the beauty of the lyrics, the melody, and the simplicity strung throughout. While it doesn't live up to continumm, it does destroy most of his previous albums (minus the live JM3 album). I suggest this album to anyone Mayer fan, or anyone who was a fan of continumm, because while it isn't as good, it is easily his second best STUDIO album.
0143034901|5.0|I'm not going to dazzle anyone with a discussion of motifs or character development, but I will give you my humble interpretations of this book.<br /><br />1) It is a compelling story, one that I tried to read slowly to lengthen the experience.<br /><br />2) I purchased this book wanting a gothic novel, and got everything I wanted - old libraries, dark backstories, secret codes and passages, etc.<br /><br />3) The author has a great knack for storytelling, giving you plenty of descriptive moments - dark alleys and disfigured antagonists...but keeps the story moving along quite nicely.<br /><br />4) Short chapters make it an ideal bedtime read because it's only 3-5 pages until the next intermission.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!
0316113506|5.0|I found SPARK to be one of the most fascinating books I have read on exercise and the brain. As an author and researcher whose focus is on integrating psychotherapy with exercise and a lecturer on stress management who focuses on using exercise to help diminish stress, I could not think of a better reference than SPARK.  Each chapter combines extensive research with real-life examples of how exercise can influence our holistic health. For individuals seeking alternative treatment options, reading SPARK will ignite an understanding of how initiating exercise can influence your choices to lead invigorating lives.<br /><br />The lucid articulation of each chapter will help you think about yourself more positively and empower you to approach to anxiety, depression, ADHD, and aging (to name a few) with a positive action oriented mind frame. Although some of the early content was dense (e.g., brain chemistry), it set a strong foundation to help me understand how much the mechanisms of the brain and how I think influence my ability to exercise. The authors did an excellent job of providing the public with a window into the powerful impact of preventative self-care through exercise. I am so glad my cousin insisted I read SPARK - it helped validate how much of an influence my choices have on my physical and mental well-being.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1432733311 My Choice - My Life: Realizing Your Ability to Create Balance in Life]]

B002QGUFWE|4.0|While this album is pretty much a pop masterpiece, it often feels very repetitive. Lady Gaga is an extremely talented musician and writer, but her talents aren't showcased nearly enough here.<br /><br />She seems like the type who has a lot to say (just look at her gay rights activism), but hasn't really said anything in her music yet. A good 80% of this album is about clubbing and dancing, and I just wonder how many times she can write about the same thing.<br /><br />My hope is that this release of The Fame is the end of this era in her career, and the official second album from Lady Gaga will be closer to what she truly wants to do. Right now, her creative control feels extremely limited.<br /><br />However, as far as pop musicians go, Lady Gaga is queen right now. I don't think there's anyone more talented (the girl actually plays instruments and sings her music live, unlike most of her peers) and I hope this is just the beginning of a very dynamic career. Long Live Gaga!
0743289692|5.0|We learn about her upbringing and life in Somalia and Saudia Arabia.  Her father's political ambitions.  Her escape to Holland and the extraordinary events to follow.  She has experienced Islam personally from Somalia to Mecca to Holland to the USA; she has great perspective.  Politically correct she is not, honest she is.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.<br /><br />I've seen its 2 DVD releases and finally BD.  The DVD versions were consistently mastered in the best possible quality, although the DVD menu design is spartan and unimaginative.<br /><br />DC is stellar in BD, and carries the reputation of fine digital mastering over to a new media. Rich, textured detail burst out in sets, costumes, CGI, and actor's faces to make DC a reference for video quality. Thread patterns on clothing, pores on faces, nearly readable text on papers held by characters are easily visible, but such details make obvious props from CGI effects, as the CGI has far less detail.<br /><br />One can watch the movie multiple times and see something new.  The BD menus and extras are identical to the DVD version, except that both director's cut and theatrical releases are on the same disk.<br /><br />Audio quality is crisp and clear, except it lacks more distributed imaging.  This is the movie's principle drawback.<br /><br />As DC exemplifies, its better to spend less on fancy BD disk menus and more to insure the highest video and audio quality is placed on disk, something we still do not see universally in many BD releases.<br /><br />If you own DC on DVD, the BD is worth the upgrade price and a steal at $10, current as of this review.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is pure singing from the heart of a gifted individual. I haven't enjoyed an album of songs for a long time.  Susan speaks to the dreams in all of us and the personal note attached to each song made each one more special. I hope she will continue to sing for us.
B002UXRH10|3.0|The violent fight between her and Chris Brown casts a shadow over Rihanna's new album, and it's hard to not think about that listening to every line, and every downtrodden, melancholy or angry beat.    Whether she's singing about Russian roulette, conveying images of car crashes and ambulances, or stepping angrily into a club, uttering curse words, it's obvious the physical wounds she suffered run deep into her soul.    If Chris Brown hadn't beaten her, this album would likely be a very different one, a bright or shiny cover, rather than the black and gray one here, and likewise, a set of shiny dance tracks and typical ballad fare, rather than the mostly plaintive ballads and subdued dance tracks that thinly veil much angst.    Call this her \\"Human Beings,\\" Seal's third and most slept-on album. On that album, with blue and black moody, creepy cover, Seal delved deep into the recesses of his soul, coming out with a hypnotic, subdued, surreal sounds. It was his least catchy album, but felt like a thorough book with songs as chapters that couldn't exist without the other.    Rihanna's \\"Rated R\\" doesn't reach the artistic heights or solidarity of music that Seal and longtime producer Trevor Horn achieved, (she is working, unsurprisingly, with a number of different, big-name producers and guest artists), but she shows the hurting person beneath her previous sunny dance tracks.    And there are some moving gems here, including \\"Russian Roulette,\\" \\"Te Amo\\" and \\"Last Song\\" (which features some U2-style guitar). But, ultimately, the album could have delved deeper into her seemingly wounded heart and soul. And perhaps if she worked with just one producer and created the album like artists of the past, rather than presenting a sampler platter of different styles (no matter how muted they are here), this could have been her \\"My Life,\\" Mary J. Blige's great bearing of the soul.    There are some weaker moments here, that almost come off as a bit pedestrian, flat and modern-pop shallow -- \\"Rude Boy,\\" \\"Fire Bomb\\" and \\"Rockstar 101\\" -- but, as is, the album stands out from much of the pop-female albums out now, because she has some pain to work through, resulting from her very public fight with Chris Brown. Perhaps, since it was so public, we don't get much deep bearing off her soul, rather we hear her anger in the words she sings, and the imagery of guns and violence that fill the moody tracks.    Simply put, it sounds like these are Rihanna's moods as interpreted and conveyed by other songwriters, which is basically the case.    hopefully Rihanna won't need another album of therapy to cast the demons that still hurt her deeply, but a more personal, self-written book of songs would likely make for a more cohesive, and heartfelt, album.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I love Susan Boyle and her voice.  Her original audition on Britain's Got Talent was firey and fresh and almost defiant.  It showed a fire in Susan's bosom that was really the energy behind her extremely gifted voice.    Although I do like her first album, I feel that she was (understandably) shy and unsure whether to just let herself go or follow a more sure and safe path.  She (as I think I would have) chose a safe path for this album... or was it her \\"handlers\\" that chose that for her?    I feel the album is very \\"overdone\\".  I agree with another review that would have loved to hear just a piano or several instruments in the background... and just let her rip each song with her voice the \\"star\\" of each track rather than her voice competing for prominence above the too heavy-handed deep toned organ and other instruments that drowned her out.  With Susan's fabulous voice... why did they need so much loud and overdone instrumentals behind her?    Simple accompaniments staying in the background allowing Susan to blaze her own path through each song would have produced a once-in-a-lifetime album.    Susan, take a deep breath... we know you have it!!  Your unworldly passionate and feisty spirit adds a depth to your singing that has touched and endeared you to us (your fans).  Don't be afraid to be your \\"Britain's Got Talented\\" SELF... we loved you then and will always love THAT Susan!!!  Listen to your inner voice.. not those that want to mold you into their image!!    Go, girl!!!  CONGRATULATIONS on a wonderful first CD... Bravo!!  more... more...
0786868724|5.0|Just started reading and it is very hard to put down. Beautifully written, as usual. He is magic with thoughts and words!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This debut album really showcases Susan's incredible voice with a nice mix of different song styles.  Well produced & a pleasure to listen to.  Just plain gorgeous, soul-filled, classy singing!
1416594787|4.0|I am currently reading the iPhone Kindle version of Richard Dawkins' \\"The Greatest Show on Earth.\\"  An excellent layman's explanation of evolution. Throughout the book there are links to colored illustrations, linking, it says, to some page that contains the illustration. However the link doesn't take you to a colored illustration. Perhaps the iPhone Kindle doesn't do color. I think a buyer should be told of that before he downloads and pays for it.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|I like this movie, i want to see the differents vision of this movie.  Music of Vangelis give me the creeps.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I am shocked that Lady GaGa would allow her label to put out these terrible censored version of her songs.  Although the songs are great, do support this album until a proper version is released.  It is NOT amazon's fault, it is the record label.  (although perhaps amazon should indicate the songs are edited to avoid any confusion or anger)  This is the only version available.  DO NOT BUY this unless you want one of those ridiculous sounding edited albums that Wal-Mart is always selling.  FREEDOM OF SPEECH.  LOOK IT UP!  IT'S IN THE THING.
0061765236|5.0|I devoured this book quite easily. Wow. This book was intense and I could not put this book down. This is only the 2nd JP book I've read. I don't read many of her books becuase they don't get great reviews but I thought this one might have promise since so many people read it. And I'm glad I checked this one out. Although some of the story points were not realistic I enjoyed the read from page 1. There wasn't a single boring part. The characters sucked me right in. And although this says its a love story I thought the book should say The Pact: A Tragedy. Great winter read. I love books I can't put down.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It's really amazing how some trashing reviews about this movie are \\"Spock seemed out of place\\" or \\" Pike was too old for the ships maiden voyage\\"- are you kidding me?. The characters were great, the story line was great, and the action and special effects were outstanding. This Trek was FAR better than Insurrection or Nemesis if you ask me.
B000X107GI|5.0|I saw 5 cells in the package in the picture that was posted. I had a hard time beleiving it's 2.99 for 5. But I received the package a few days later. I couldn't beleive my eyes! What a great deal!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This disc gives me the chills every single time I listen.    I connect emotionally to the sound and it gives me the chills in a scared, cold, nervous, expectant way.
B002X1ZEPA|5.0|Rihanna went in a darker direction with this album and I really like it. If you're looking for a bunch of dance tracks like she's done in the past, you'll probably be disappointed. This is a break up album.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|The thing that makes top 40 so hard to listen to is that it sounds manufactured; what can make indie bands grating is their pretension.. but La Roux overcomes these, bringing a fresh sound (well, okay, hearkening back to the 80s, but still) that is fun to listen to and vamping choruses that are fun to sing to - absolutely no pretense here! I saw her perform in LA at the El Rey and she is even better live - a harder, more angry, \\"I'm not your toy\\" than what is on the album which La Roux *ahem* should record and share with the world..
B002RKXO6S|4.0|This CD is good - not great.   They always have great songs with great lyrics.   No song on this CD is great, and none is terrible.   The problem with this and other recent CDs of theirs is Jon started singing through his nose just when their CDs started to get kinda boring (Have a Nice Day; Bounce; It's My Life, etc.)   It is annoying to watch him sing these days because he tries to sound better or stronger by making it very nasal sounding.   Jon also has shown to be really full of himself on talk shows and on the Showtime special \\"When we were Beautiful\\"  (the name alone says alot about his ego.)   He made it a point to tell everyone that this CD is number one (on the Ellen show).   She did not bring it up, he did.   She probably did not bring it up because of course it is number one since it sells for $3.99!   Still a great band - just a bit too egotistical and nasal for my taste.   If the ticket prices for bad seats are really $150.00 as someone else commented, why go to the show when Jon will sing all the oldies through his nose.   Better to get the original non-nasal cds and listen to them and save $150.00 plus drinks, parking, etc.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|I love Robocop movies. I always wanted to buy the trilogy, but it was always too expensive. Amazon helped me get my movies at a great price. Thanks.
0071636080|5.0|This is a nifty little book with lots of ideas that can reshape your presentations away from the typical. If you are  a 'mumbler' or say \\"umm\\" a great deal when public speaking - this book cannot save you. But it can help people who are good at public speaking get a whole lot better.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Just received my CD today! Wow!! I Just finished playing it and I am just blown away by Susan's voice  as she was singing the selections. She truly is a very  wonderful person and is sure on her way to being  someone. Everything about the CD is fabulous, her  photo on the CD, the nice notes she added about each  one of the songs, and she's just being herself. The   wait for the release of the CD was well worth it. I   will be playing it over and over, until the next one is  produced. And YES!, I would buy tickets to see her sing.  esouz1264
B002QY9RMA|5.0|This product should really be called the Revised Edition. It is exactly like the deluxe but it includes more tracks. It's veyr optional. If you have the deluxe edition already Beyoncé is offering JUST the bonus tracks on amazon. It's great for the people who haven't bought I Am... Sasha Fierce which is one of the best albums of 2008.     If you like Adult Contemporary, soft rock, electro-pop, R&B, hip-hop, Urban Adult Contemporary, Soul, or almost any genre, this is the album for you. This album is a buffet of genres. BUY IT.
1577314808|5.0|I am in the middle of the book and I am having trouble putting it down, only did so to give this review ; )   What Eckhart explains makes so much perfect sense. I only hope that I can achieve what is in this book, and with some work I know I can do it. It's not as hard as one may think. The fact is the thinking is what gets in our way. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed!  Happy reading......
B00005QGAX|3.0|Michael Jackson's third solo album, Bad, is more electrified comparing to the previous albums--tracks produced by Quincy Jones are more synthesized and drum programming is substantially used. As a result, the sound become less intriguing but the simplified tracks underscore catchy melodies of songs written by Michael, including four out of the five consecutive number ones on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. While showing off his talent as a singer/songwriter with the album, he is more focusing on establishing as a superstar entertainer with multiple talents, including dance performance that now draws more attention from his fans.
B002X1ZEPA|5.0|This is a work of art. (she is a music artist). I would rate this 10 stars. I am proud of her for standing up and singing her hart out about what she has had to go through.Let us not forget how young she is. Great job Rihanna... Great job.Take a bow girl.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I can relate to Ms.Boyle,My life so much paralled hers in troubles and fears.But GOD gave her a blessing of singing and that she does.I truelly hope she makes more albums,her voice can bring this man to tears,but good tears of triumph that she has gone through.Sing Susan Sing!!!!!!!!
B001J53X9U|1.0|The film and the BD deserve 5 stars.      Unless you are a serious collector who won't open the package, buy the regular BD or DVD.  I fully expected to get a normally packaged BD along with a nice collectible.  Not at all so.  I had to destroy any collectible value the item had to see the film.  Since there is no BD case to speak of, the whole thing just sits atop a 7' bookcase becoming something else to dust.  I prefer to keep it out of sight since it is so cheap.  Oh well.        Like others who rated this item ONE STAR, I'm only trying to help future buyers to be informed before they make their purchase.
B002X20W2E|5.0|I have been looking forward to this album for over a year now. I was unsure which direction she was going to take this one. I didnt want to hear another Good Girl Gone Bad... and I didnt want her to follow in the footsteps of her electro pop \\"Disturbia\\". Everyone kept talking about how dark the album was going to be and how she turned her back on her pop friendly roots. I dont think this sound is a far stretch for her... She even showcased her harder side on Good Girl Gone Bad... With songs like \\"Breakin Dishes\\", \\"Question Existing\\", and \\"Let me get that\\". I think Rated R shows her growth as an artist and a vocalist. The entire album isnt angry and dark... It has fun songs like \\"Rude boy\\" and \\"Te Amo\\"... an unexpected vocal production with \\"Photographs\\" and a very heart felt song with \\"Cold Case Love\\". No the album isnt perfect I felt like it could have done without the Neyo penned \\"Stupid in Love\\" and \\"Fire Bomb\\" was too much noise for me.I wish there were two more dance tracks and More production from Justin Timberlake. I would prefer if \\"Wait your Turn\\" was cut into an intro and \\"Mad House\\" could have been a full song. All and all Rated R has to be one of the best albums that I purchased this year giving me every emotion that I needed.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I wish that all of the Star Trek films had been created by the same team as the writers/director of this film. Each segment was thoughtful and exciting. Vonne Barnett
B002X063OC|1.0|Beware - this album has censored versions of the songs.  The word 'bitch' is replaced by 'bit' in Bad Romance!
B0015BKUZ8|5.0|This transaction went like a charm!! The album was exactly what they said it was. It sounds great and was a great deal!! I would  definitely buy from them again.
B00006D295|5.0|We got this movie to play on Halloween when some friends came over. It was fun singing along. Everyone had a blast.
0061251305|5.0|I ordered this book for the leadership of my team.  It is an excellent book with many good suggestions on leadership.  Very helpful and practical.  The insight is amazing.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|if Star Trek had never existed and this movie hadn't been created as a parody of it, galaxy Quest would still stand on its own merits as a good space comedy-adventure movie. Fun for the whole family! I enjoy it wayyyy more than Spaceballs
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I love the animation of this movie, it totally rocks, BUT the movie itself is pretty pointless. There's also a few gray areas:<br /><br />Where was Rusell's mom during all of this?<br />What happened to his dad?<br />How did the \\"bad guy\\" get to Paraside Falls?<br /><br />It left a few question marks that were never answered. Also, I think it may be a little too wild for kids. There are gun shots, violence, a small blood scene ( th old man knocks somone with his cane and the man is left bleeding), agressive dogs, etc. Just think twice before you watch your little one watch it.<br /><br />Just my opinion.....
B000024C7W|5.0|Long B4 Al Gore and other organic and green environmentalist lobbies had 2 scratch their head with scientists on how 2 cure the climate change problem occuring on earth and how 2 remedy that, the Washington dc Smithsonian Institute, had asked M.Wonder 2 elaborate music 4 a movie seeking 2 display the grandeur of nature on earth, fm it's creation till the day. It was then released very late 70's (copyright of the album is 79) or ely 80's and I was fortunate enuf 2 be on location 2 see n hear it at the time: a master experiment!Some of the songs are so powerful in their words, it will apply 4ever: or as long as there is nature around us, viz life!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I loved all the songs on this CD. Reading Susan's personal comment on each of the songs on the CD made it so special and personal. I wish Susan continued success in the future. I would purchase additional CD's in a heartbeat.
B002XUL85G|1.0|I am a horror genre junkie, and whereas I really loved The Blair Witch Project, I really disliked this. I walked away from the theater, which had 6 other people in it, going seriously, I paid for this?? Even my 19 year old son wasn't impressed and he scares easily. I kept waiting for the feeling of fear to hit me and it never did. I looked at my phone to check the time and it was an hour in already and nothing fantastic had happened yet.<br /><br />My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.<br /><br />I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back. My husband wanted to see it and I told him he'd be better off to wait for it to hit DVD and watch it then. If you haven't seen it, rent the movie before you buy it.
B00000DI06|4.0|Beautiful music.  I first heard this played on public radio and put a lot of effort into tracking down the recording. The music and performance are stunningly beautiful and parts of it move me to tears. The one big problem that detracts is the very inconsistent decibel level throughout that requires frequent adjustments of the volume control.
0740785508|5.0|This is a great book, but it is not an instruction book for the beginner.  The author describes techniques, but it is assumed that the reader is advanced enough to try the techniques on their own.  However, that does not mean the book is only for artist.  I am not an artist, but I enjoyed the book immensely.  The author does a wonderful job of describing the \\"art behind the art.\\"  After reading this book you will be able to look at any painting, drawing, graphic art, etc. with a much keener eye and with deeper appreciation.      The book is written in a way that a lay man can understand the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\" of how a particular look is achieved.  It is also a great reference manual for creating your own imaginative world.  If you have an artist within, then you will love this book.  If you just like fantasy artwork, you will also enjoy this book.  Enjoy!
B002JTHFUS|5.0|The remasters thus far have been great and this one continues that tradition. The inclusion of additional material and other little bonus items is always a good thing and the packaging on this one is equal to the already available \\"Joshua Tree\\". Glad to see U2 are ahead of the game in keeping their catalogue updated.
1932100660|3.0|Dr. Campbell does a good job compiling a large number of epidemiological studies and nutrition.  However, the book is poorly edited.  It is very repetitive, and not altogether coherent.  The title is indeed misleading, as many reviewers point out, because only a small portion of the book is devoted to the China study itself.  Several possible mechanisms for animal food consumption causing disease are proposed, but there doesn't seem to be enough evidence to justify the sweeping conclusions.  It is stated early in the book that combining vegetable protein sources to create complete protein is not important, but he never explains why this is the case.  It's a good starting point, but the reader must go elsewhere for more substantial results.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|As a fan for more than 45 years, the \\"mythical mono\\" masters were always some how out of my reach. This box is a true treasure and is magnificent in everyway. Great packaging, liner notes....etc. As I grew up on the mono/stereo singles and the stereo American albums, which still sounded like mono coming from my ancient record player, these are closer to my original memories. I did not experience true stereo until the \\"White Album\\" in 1968, even though 8-track tapes did provide some channel separation. So by and far these are the songs as the Beatles themselves wanted them heard and I am thankful to finally have and hear them as they were intended to be. I own the new stereo box as well and greatly enjoy listening to the differences. To the casual listener the stereo remasters are all you need. And if your a fan like me, I'm sure you already have them both.
B002VECM40|5.0|Perhaps \\"thought provoking\\" isn't the right phrase to use. This movie will whip you about and leave you breathless, most especially if you've never really considered the plight of children/people like Precious.<br /><br />I have been teaching adult students for a little over ten years now, and I have had many women whose backgrounds were similar to Precious' background, so the subject matter wasn't new to me. I expected to be moved, but I didn't expect to have to struggle to stop crying after the movie was over.<br /><br />The movie is about a teenager named Precious (a truly ironic name, as she is told and shown repeatedly that she is NOT precious to anyone in her immediate circle) and the horrific circumstances of her life at the age of 16.  She is pregnant with her second child, the product of incest (her \\"father\\" rapes her, a fact which her mother chooses instead to see as Precious threatening her by taking away her man and giving him more babies than he ever allowed the mom to have), and she is barely holding together some semblance of a normal life by keeping her true circumstances from everyone around her.<br /><br />When her school principal becomes aware of her pregnancy, she decides to send Precious to an alternative school, and for the first time, the teenager has an opportunity to see her own potential and to have that potential respected by others. It's a truly life-altering opportunity, and Precious takes it.<br /><br />What's really amazing in this film is the excellence of the acting. You've likely heard time and time again how Mariah Carey doesn't wear makeup and looks haggard and old, and you've probably heard about Monique's superb turn as Precious' mother. What can't be conveyed without you actually watching the movie is what all that means. To me, it meant witnessing moments when an actor found ways to manipulate his/her body language and expressions to create a character in one movement. Precious, for example, is both a burdened, pitiful human being whose scrunched-up face and blank expression tell the audience that she is very nearly spiritually dead. Then, in an instant, she begins to daydream, and her body, her expression, her entire carriage is transformed. She radiates happiness and sensuality, a sense of being totally alive and joy-filled. It's more than the clothing and makeup. It's everything that shows up on her face, in the way she moves, in the lifting of her brow so that she no longer looks closed off to life. Incredible.<br /><br />Monique is also excellent, from the bland expression of a couch potato who is frozen before the tube to the rage of a woman who feels betrayed by the very daughter she has betrayed so often. Awesome. There is a scene where she is trying to convince someone that she loves Precious, and she earnestly tries to prove that she has strongly positive and loving memories of her daughter, only to find that she can't even get the dates in the memory right, that she can't get something as important as a milestone date right. The expression on her face as she realizes both the depths of her own abandonment of her daughter and the fact that others can see through her I'm-a-great-mom facade--excellent.<br /><br />There are many uncomfortable moments in this movie, moments that made my fellow audience members laugh but which truly were heartbreaking. In the midst of horrible abuse, a tiny glimmer of something funny--so tough to take, but also evidence of how life is rarely simply one thing or another.<br /><br />Precious' life will blow you away if you've never met or known anyone like her. It will sadden you, and hopefully it will enrage you enough to do more for people like her. I know that it made me think about the strong women I've taught who pulled themselves out of situations like the one depicted in the movie, and it made me more determined to really get to know my students so that someone like Precious will not slip through the cracks when I can possibly help.<br /><br />See this movie because the acting is so superb.  Remember it because its imagery is powerful and real. And hopefully, never forget that there are many, many women and children out there who have had lives like Precious'.ecause its imagery is powerful and real. And hopefully, never forget that there are many, many women and children out there who have had lives like Precious'.
B002QB1910|5.0|I have loved all of Rihanna's albums but I think this one is my favorite.  Every song has so much emotion, so far my favorite is photographs, but this is one of those albums where you just let all the songs play, hit repeat, then repeat again.  Perfect album as we get to see a totally different side of her that we have not seen in previous efforts.  Amazing!!!
B002N8A14M|4.0|I was looking for an iPod case for my 5g Nano that had a clip for attaching to my waist, and this was the only one I could find. Honestly I don't care about the armband aspect and have never used it. The shell is two pieces, one of which slides over the top and the other over the bottom. It's a little harder to connect the sync cable and headphones jack once the case is in place, but it works okay. The clip is part of the top shell and is a little bulky, but that's what makes it able to attach to a belt. Overall I'm happy with the product but would have preferred to buy the clip case alone and saved a few bucks.
0757302661|5.0|I bought this book for a research project and ended up being so engrossed in it that I read the whole book in one day.  The history of HypnoBirthing is very real and the method is so easy.      The basic idea is an explanation of what hypnosis is and to dispell the myths about Hypnosis.  You are in full control and are not disassociated or \\"away from your body\\".  I am glad that I read this book before my first child.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast (Special Platinum Edition) was shipped as ordered. My granddaughters love it. many thanks
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite series. The characters are exceptional, as is the unique and compelling story line. I could not resist getting this set after I watched the series for the first time. The movie Serenity ([[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]]) is also a must have. Any sci fi/fantasy fan will be thrilled with this series!
B0025KVLTM|1.0|This is the most painful album to listen from my remaster box set. It is full of silly and forgetable songs. With the notable exception of Sgt. Pepper..., With A Little Help..., Lucy in the Sky..., and A Day in...That is it. The rest are fillers. That is four great songs against seven mediocre at best. I will never understand the hype surrounding this album. It is regarded as the best Rock and Roll album of all time, a real masterpiece, a piece of art, etc, and it really is a let down to me. Rock or Rock and Roll it is not; pure pop/bubblegum stuff. I dig the cover, though. I know the majority of you Beatles fan out there will disagree with me, but this is my opinion. You must admit, as I did as a fan, that this is The Beatles at their worst.
B000HIVQLW|4.0|I'd prefer a different order of the songs while the overall range, amount and quality of the music produced by this band is astounding. So, just remix with the older and early stuff a bit later in the mix and better integrated. Then it gets 5 stars.
B001EYGOEM|1.0|You would think with all the awards she has been winning that this would actually be a good album. Well, it isn't, and she wouldn't be able to sing live and sound good if her life depended on it. Good thing she has a large amount of mindless followers that support her in everything she does because most people with with a brain know she's mediocre at best.

B002T921AC|1.0|Who knew singing like a girl and being \\"cute\\" could get you famous? This album is really bad as you can see from the reviews. A year from now there will be another adorable teen with mediocre vocals who drives all the little girls crazy. Till then we are stuck with this kid.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I am very pleased with my Michael Buble purchase. There are several selections I play over and over because I enjoy them so much. I especially enjoy \\"Everything.\\"

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|The Killers Live from Royal Albert Hall is pure rocking from start to finish. No fanciful sets or costume changes but Brandon Flowers and band mates are full of energy and the setlist is extremely tight, alternating between their big hits and eclectic tracks. Rock to Human, Somebody Told Me, Mr. Brightside, When You Were Young, Smile Like You Mean It and much more. At the end of it, you will find yourself exhausted, jumping and singing along with them, right in the comfort of your home.<br /><br />The disc itself plays hi-def quality crystal clear on your HDTV and the sound is impeccable as you blast it through the speakers. And I must say whoever designed the interactive menu has created one of the best and most appealing navigation experience ever on a blu ray disc. Would have wished that they included all their videos to date as extras. Still, this is nothing less than the best! A+
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I'll start out with an anecdote.  A guy I know was starting out in the songwriting business.  He was hardly making any money at all.  To keep himself fed, he'd wait for the once a week 29 cent burger special at his local McDonalds.  Then he'd buy fifty of those things and put him in his freezer.  It was the cheapest way for him to get his \\"fuel\\" for the week.<br /><br />That guy is now a very successful songwriter.  He also weighs about 280.  He's one of the oldest looking 40 year old men that I know.  I'm sure he's still eating a lot of awful food even though he's no longer eating the 29 cent specials and using the Dollar Menu.<br /><br />This movie goes a long way in explaining just why we eat the junk that we do even though it's killing us.  The film shows that we do it partly because it's ridiculously cheap.  It's cheap because the government subsidizes growing the corn that provides us with our starch and sugar.  It's cheap because we treat our farm animals with incredible cruelty in the name of \\"efficiency.\\"<br /><br />The approach in this movie is a bit scattershot, but Food, Inc. does get its points across. I think it would have been far better if the film makers would have ignored the issue of genetically modified foods and patent law and kept focused on the issue of what we eat and why.  That said, overall the movie is well made, and clearly more money was put into this movie than most documentaries. It lifts the veil on the ugly world of agribusiness.  You can read about this issue in books, but seeing it with your own eyes is something else entirely. What you see in this movie likely will make you change your diet for the better.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Not only was the cinematography outstanding, the few episodes I was able to see before buying the DVD's were not the true depth of the series.  The writing and original story make this a sure fantasy / sci-fi favorite (and I'm picky).  I am still very much impressed with the fact that this is a television series, that the actors do such an outstanding job, and the writing helps to lift the series rather than hinder it.  Do you want a show that actually makes you say \\"wow\\" after an episode?  Then watch it!
B002XUL85G|1.0|Don't know why anyone would buy this DVD. The movie was awful. Just download the trailer! Those scenes in the trailer are the best parts of the movie. Period!
B0026P3G12|5.0|By now, everyone knows the story of Ms. Boyle's stunning rise to fame: we have watched the youtube video of her walk out onto the Britain's Got Talent stage dressed in a frumpy frock, her humble, unpolished, middle-aged appearance mocked by both the audience and judges alike. Then she began to sing \\"I dreamed a dream.\\" And everything changed. The famously critical Simon Cowell had to admit that Ms. Boyle was exceptional. That video now has over 100 million views on youtube, and Ms. Boyle has the number one album in the world. By any standards, this is magical.     And her new cd does not disappoint: it is magical in its beauty and artistry. I trained for years as a classical singer and Ms. Boyle's musicality, her ability to \\"feel\\" a song and perform the song with both musical precision and emotional passion, is quite advanced for a woman who has never been a professional singer. She has a natural musical ability to match her unrivaled voice. Of all the vocalists I have listened to over the years, her voice is frankly one of the most beautiful I have ever heard. I was delighted to listen to it showcased so skillfully on this cd. She still has some room to grow as a professional singer so her performance isn't flawless but it is -- nevertheless -- warm and lovely.     You will absolutely not be disappointed by this collection; the song selections are brilliant and the cd makes for a powerful, haunting listening experience. One is at once reminded of Ms. Boyle's own life as we listen to the heartbreak of \\"I dreamed a dream\\" or the loneliness of \\"You'll See\\" but such is Ms. Boyle's talent that these songs are at once hers and ours as she shares them with us. Her voice is gorgeous; it is also generous. She invites us into the songs with her so we experience the songs as emotional journeys. This also marks Ms. Boyle's skill as an artist as many singers have lovely voices. but their voices are cold in their loveliness. Ms. Boyle's voice is heartbreakingly beautiful and also inclusive. It embraces us.     Particularly excellent are the selections \\"Wild Horses\\" (The Rolling Stones song from 1971), Madonna's \\"You See\\" (which Susan may be directing to the schoolyard bullies who ridiculed her for having learning disabilities), \\"Amazing Grace,\\" \\"Silent Night,\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\" (a unique rendition of the Monkees smash hit).
B000F8O35U|1.0|We recieved the DVD in a very timely matter, but when we actually opened the DVD, we knew immediately that there was something wrong with it. The picture on the front of the DVD looked like it had been printed on a printer that was running out of ink and was very smudged. We tried to get the movie to play on 3 different dvd players and could never get it to work. The bonus disc worked fine,  but not the actual movie disc. I dont know much about bootleg movies, but if I was too guess, I would say this was one. I would like to say though, that we did recieve an immediate response, when we emailed about the problem, and I had a credit on my credit card by the next day.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I'm not going to review The Fame. It has been mentioned many times before.<br /><br />So much's been said about Lady GaGa this past year, her provocative fashion, desire to shock and uncanny ability to create a killer hook which included five US Top 10 singles by now. Then there was the comparison to Madonna, Christina Aguilera and Gwen Stefani.<br /><br />The truth is Lady GaGa makes darn good electropop music and she is not ashamed of it. There's no hiding behind the art or talk of being eclectic. The Fame Monster is not so much a breakthrough but a showcase of GaGa's talent of creating catchy songs. Bad Romance, while unfairly compared to some of her past hits, is a stomper, the sort that belongs to a fashion runway. The big chorus and somewhat erratic vocals speak of the joys of a bad romance. Other standout tracks include the celebrity-name calling Dancer in the Dark with all its electronic stutter (and we haven't heard such stylish name calling since Madonna's Vogue). Then there's the insidiously infectious Monster and So Happy I Could Die where GaGa sings about loving that lavender blond and feeling good touching herself all through the night. Of course, Beyonce pays a courtesy call on Telephone, a sort of a followup to their collaboration Video Phone, but ten times more danceable and catchy. Then there's the sole emotional ballad, Speechless, which by the end, would have left one wondering if GaGa had sung about brokenhearted self.<br /><br />The Fame Monster continues where The Fame left off. I only wish it were longer or included all her spectacular videos. A-
B002X20W2E|5.0|I, like most people, closely followed the February 2009 Grammy incident between Chris Brown and Rihanna, and was absolutely shocked to hear what had happened to her. I have been a Rihanna fan for many years, so it came as a shock to me that someone so famous could go through something so horrible. Long story short, I think it's amazing that she's speaking out on domestic violence and is telling her story to people in hopes of preventing it from happening to other women.<br /><br />I wasn't too impressed by Rated R's first single, \\"Russian Roulette\\", because it sounded very dark and depressing. But after a few listens, I fell in love with the song. The album's other two singles that were released shortly afterward, \\"Hard\\" and \\"Wait Your Turn\\", also grew on me. I wasn't too sure if I liked Rihanna's sound, but after Rated R leaked online, I knew it would be an instant hit. Every song on this album would make an amazing single, and every song has a story behind it. As Rihanna said, this is like her movie, and she's ready to show people who she really is. I highly recommend this album to any fan of Rihanna - or music in general. It may take a few listens to get used to it, but I can guarantee that you will love it.
B000EGDB10|4.0|For some reason, I was a bit surprised to find Mr. De Palma involved in recreating a television series for the screen. Then, again, why not?  Many of us fondly remember Peter Graves receiving his assignment, which we know he will not refuse, though being offered that option. The team which then took over was pretty ingenious but had none of the technology which was to be invented by the mid-nineties. With the help of these devices available when the film was made,  DePalma directed a tricky production in which the interrelationships among people are as important as those among hardware. The result is interesting. Jon Voight has the heft to play the senior team director while Tom Cruise seems a bit lightweight to be the team leader ( though he emotes adequately). Other members of the cast meet their specifications as good guys (of either sex) or villains sufficiently well to meet  the limited demands put upon them.  All in all, a good theatrical conversion of a television show more limited in time to rehearse and time to fill with action. Motivated me to get the two sequels which I have not yet seen.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This is a great war mini-series no matter what your political affiliation or thoughts about the current war in Iraq.  You will sit through the whole thing with your mouth open the whole time.  I am not someone that is into war movies or action flicks but even I loved watching this.  There is drama, action, and humor.  Be sure to watch the panel at the end with the real marines that this series is based on.  You will be AMAZED at how SPOT ON the actors nailed their characters.  Especially with Alexander Skarsgård and Brad Colbert considering Alex did not meed Brad til AFTER they were done shooting.  I can not recommend this series enough.  Everyone should see it just to see what the marines had to go through.  This is based on real people and real events.  It's not fiction.  2 of the real marines are in the movie the main being Rudy Reyes and he was AWESOME.  I admit the only reason I originally watched this is because I am a huge fan of Alexander Skarsgård and he is brilliant in it esp considering he is a Swede playing an American soldier but I must admit after watching it . . . it would still have had the same effect on me without him being in it.
0060007737|5.0|Best branding book out there. Mr. Ries and his daughter has been presenting practical examples of real case companies who have applied good and bad practices, and the results and conclusions are widely seen in real life. This book must be an essential reading for anybody who wants to develop new products.
B002XUL85G|5.0|I love horror films. They are good old fashioned mindless fun. They never scare me, they are really just amusing to me. But this movie, on the other hand, freaked me out. In fact it still freaks me out a bit to this day and its been several weeks since i saw the film. My wife and I went and saw the movie in theaters.  We were the only ones in the theater, which I'm sure helped add to our fear. We could swear we were hearing things the whole time. We thought we heard the theater door open and close, yet no one walked in. We swear we could hear things walking around us. Yet no one was there. Im pretty sure it was the movie screwing with us, or maybe it was our minds that were screwing with us. Either way, that night we slept with the lights on. No joke. It is a freaky film. It is a fun film. It is a scary film. It will mess with you. Don't listen to people who are hating on it, they just wanna seem \\"oh so cool\\" but not being scared by the movie. Samething happened with Blair Witch Project. It became \\"cool\\" to hate on it. Watch it yourself and decide for yourself.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I received my audio CD by Susan Boyle from Amazon today and what a pleasure it is.    Susan Boyle is one of the most beautiful singers of our time, but with a nostalgic voice of the  golden Fifties.    Gorgeous.  Passionate..Moving...Soul-stirring, sublime.     A remarkable story this woman is,  and a gift to humanity.     You will never hear \\"Cry Me A River\\" sung more hauntingly beautiful than this treasure by the treasure who is Susan Boyle.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I saw the trailer for this movie on HDNet's \\"Nothing but Trailers\\" and was enthralled!!! When the movie made it's release I was lucky enough to find a theater, somewhat, near me and go see it! What a film, absolutely brilliant!!! Brilliant script, and acting, how refreshing it is to see a movie this good, do it on merit and not on big budget and special effects. Well this movie completely grabbed me and hasn't let go yet. I sincerely hope that Sam Rockwell gets an Oscar nod for his performance, as it is one of the best you will ever see. It's a shame that this couldn't garner more of a wide release, but I do feel fortunate that I was able to experience it when I had the chance. And a little FYI, for all the Moon fans that can't wait until the US release on Jan 12th. I ordered my copy (blu-ray)from Amazon.co.uk, a few months ago and received it in the mail last Wednesday. I wasn't sure, but took the chance that it would play on my PS3 and it does, it is region free. I've watched it twice so far, with another viewing soon to come. I don't want to say with 100% certainty, but if I understand correctly if the disc is region free it should work with all blu-ray players as I think all players are region free. Anyway it says on the box, region free and I plays on PS3's so there ya go. Hope this helps anyone who is interested!

B002QY9RMA|3.0|I am a hardcore Beyonce fan, but I never consider buying this re-release of her latest album \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce,\\" because the physical CD only has two new songs, \\"Video Phone (Extended Mix feat. Lady Gaga) and \\"Poison.\\" If you count the Wal-Mart exclusive \\"Why Don't You Love Me,\\" then there are still only three, so why would you pay a standard CD price for just 2 new songs if you've bought the original deluxe edition?    If you still want to support Beyonce in a legal sense, then just go to iTunes Store, and download the iTunes exclusive \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce (Bonus Track EP),\\" which only has the three new songs. Otherwise, you can just download the new songs from Mininova.org or other places for free.     Nevertheless, \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" is still one of the best albums of 2008, so if you haven't bought this album, then you can buy this re-release without any hesitation.    The perfect re-release tracklist, however, could have been the following:    1. Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)  2. Diva  3. Ego (Remix feat. Kanye West)  4. Halo  5. If I Were A Boy  6. Smash Into You  7. Sweet Dreams  8. Broken Hearted Girl  9. Scared Of Lonely  10. That's Why You're Beautiful  11. Hello  12. Radio  13. Video Phone (Extended Mix feat. Lady Gaga)  14. Poison  15. Why Don't You Love Me  16. Honesty  17. Save The Hero  18. Satellites  19. Disappear  20. Ave Maria     The tracklist above is basically the tracklist of the international platinum edition, which has never been released in the U.S., but instead of featuring the original versions of \\"Ego\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" again, it should just have the remixes instead in order to have all the new songs, and as CDs are cheaper in the U.S. than in Europe and Japan, it also makes sense that the U.S. release should not have all the released songs for this album.
B002XUL85G|5.0|Paranormal Activity was a work of Modern Art... I say this because for someone to truly appreciate this movie they have to understand that at first glance it's too much hype for any movie to successfully fulfill. What most of society was expecting was the impossible. While this film allowed you to react to the situations as if you were in that room the whole time, It also has a way of showing you just enough without making it too far fetched. Brilliant balance between effects and story. The best thing about Paranormal Activity had nothing to do with the content of the movie at all. The best part was that it was introduced to us as a whole through email (demand it) and face book along with other social networking tools. That makes this film so much more indie and filled with passion (passion from Spielberg none the less!) So what if the acting was sub par and the effects were not in-your-face... I think we need to stray from the stereotypical mind set that our blockbusters need massive explosions and other mind blowing visual effects.
B002FOQY2M|4.0|While I'm a big fan of power pop ( done right, that is ), I wasn't sure what to make of this album when I first heard snippets from it. I must say that it is a rare and pleasant surprise. It's a well-crafted, great-sounding, and just plain fun to listen to album. It may at first seem to be over-produced, but it's not. It may at first seem to lack depth, but it doesn't. It's pure power-pop all the way, but not in the same vein as Badfinger or Big Star - it's more of a weird kind of melding of Queen and ELO, with a dash of Cheap Trick thrown in. The songs are all catchy and melodic, and the lyrics are pretty darn good to boot. Great ( big ) little album these guys put out.
B002T45VX6|5.0|I've always liked Shakira, but this time, she's outdone herself.  Its not often you can buy a CD, play it for the first time, and say to yourself, \\"This is one hot CD\\"...I know I'll be playing it over and over again in my car...lots of good beat, and she's just an awesome female singer as well as a fantastic entertainer...this will be the hottest CD this Christmas season, is my prediction!!
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|There is no point in trying to list all of the flaws in this adaptation of Austen's classic; I would be here all day! What possessed the makers of this film to cast Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet, or Donald Sutherland as her father? Knightly's Lizzy is a giggling and immature airhead, with no depth of character whatsoever. The language and behaviour of the time is ignored, the dialogue is very clumsy, and the costumes and general appearance of the characters are shabby. Macfadyen's Darcy looked as bored as I was. Did the scriptwriters read the book before setting about writing the script? Was any historical research done? I doubt both. There isn't a scene in the entire film that I can say a good thing about. So badly done. So disappointing.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|What a load of krap!  This isn't Star Trek, boldly going - it's lame frat boy getting drunk, bar fight, skirt chasing.  You want that, go get a copy of <any> of the American Pie movies ( and those were better done too ! )  I feel sorry for Leonard Nimoy & Zachary Quinto, the only people in this trainwreck that were worth actually paying attention to as actors.  Have to agree with previous reviewers how much this ripped-off Star Wars, if the director focused more on what Star Trek is about vs. what woould be the next \\"action shot\\" this would be a totally differnt kind of movie and one worth rating more starts to recommend its purchase.    Sure hope Paramount dumps this director / writer and fires whoever came up with this kind of a re-boot.  It's just as stupid as the one done for Superman Returns, and probably forever drive away the fan base to ever consider going to see another of the franchise releases again.
B000058983|5.0|It's been a number of years since I bought this CD and I'm still frequently bringing it off my shelves of nearly 1000 cds to listen to it. I had never heard it, as far as I remember in the hazy late 60's when it was originally released. I bought it based on some fantastic reviews I read. The reviewers were right, this album is a true classic. We've all heard of classic albums by groups like the Beach Boys, The Zombies, Beatles, etc., etc., but most people have never heard of this band. I'm telling you that if you somehow made it to this Love page on Amazon that,yes, a band that never sold more than about 100,000 copies of any of its albums (and that wasn't this one) in their original release, did make one of the finest rock albums ever and this is it. Incidentally I bought their first two albums after this one and was disappointed. This is the album that Arthur Lee thought would be his last and he paid great attention to detail and gave it his all. Some people I play it for say they sound similar to the Beatles. I've heard it called an acoustic symphony. Psychedelic folk rock is the genre they were tagged with. Arthur Lee wrote fantastic songs here and sings beautifully on them. The songs are acoustic based, but electric guitars are used quite effectively as well as horns and strings. The album flows and has some lyrics that will make you jerk your head around to look at the speakers. To conclude I believe this easily should be placed in a list of the best 10, 20 or 30 rock albums of all time and should therefore be considered for your music collection.
B000ICL3CO|5.0|This is one of The Cure's most varied CDs and is a bargain in the single disc remastered format. Great pop songs include \\"Just Like Heaven\\" and \\"Catch.\\" Lengthier songs like \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" and \\"The Snakepit\\" show how varied Robert Smith's songwriting can be.
B000WC39YU|5.0|Take this simply as an informative review concerning this specific DVD release.  When reading through some of the other reviews for the newest Special Edition Mad Max DVD, there were some confusing complaints that I came across, many of which were complaining that the DVD was badly formatted and that the voices had been dubbed over by American actors.  After some further pondering, I realized that the reviewers were commenting on a different DVD release that came out prior to the Special Edition, as well as prior to this Decades Collection Edition.      To put it plainly, this is a retouched version of the theatrical release as far as picture and sound quality.  The sound is in very nice stereo, and the picture has been digitally restored and is in Wide Screen format.  There are NO American voice overs added.  There are a few extras on the DVD, including poster art, two documentaries, and a few trailers.  All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase. It was extremely cheap for the quality.  If you want a low-cost, good version of Mad Max and are not too interested in a bunch of DVD extras, this is a no brainer.       P.S.  Also included is a CD with some hit 70's songs on it, including some Marvin Gaye and Rod Stewart...so, if you haven't heard these heavily overplayed songs on the radio enough, you can own them on CD at no additional cost!
B002UXRH10|4.0|Rihanna's 2009 and fourth effort, \\"Rated R,\\" is the best album of her career and one of the best albums of the year. Why? This album dares to be different from the masses and previous Rihanna efforts, as she presents herself with more edge, sexier, daring, and more truthful than ever before.  The album starts with a small interlude titled \\"Mad House,\\" which really does a good job of setting the album's tone. \\"Wait Your Turn\\" is the first song on the album and it gets the listener vibing quickly. Rihanna gives no time for breath, as the album turns to \\"Hard\\" feat. Young Jeezy, followed by \\"Stupid In Love.\\" All of the tracks are creative, outgoing, and some of her best work. \\"Rockstar 101\\" is a bit corny, but the albums picks up again with the lead single \\"Russian Roulette.\\" The rest of the album continues like the first half, as all the songs present themselve with an edge and passion.  Rihanna really sheds her pop image with this album, as majority of the songs have a hard rock edge about them, with the exception of a few tracks. She's also cursing, as well as proudly presenting her bold personality and sexuality throughout the album's lyrics, and liner notes.   In my opinion, this is Rihanna's best album and one of the best albums I've heard this year. She took artistic chances with \\"Rated R,\\" changing her whole persona and agenda. This album seems more truthful than her previous three efforts.  Rihanna fans may not like this album if they're looking for her bubble-gum/pop albums of the past. She's definitely grown as a person and as an artist with this record. If you're wanting to hear a good album and have no preconceived notions going into it, buy \\"Rated R.\\"
B0025KVLSI|4.0|Reviewing a Beatles album is no easy task.  I think only diehard fans or critics would even attempt it.  Everyone else is just giving their opinion.  Not quite right?  I suppose those who listened to popular music in the sixties would attempt it as well.  Again, everyone else is just giving their opinion or betraying their taste in music.  For starters,  the Beatles music changed from disc to disc.  They played a variety of music and were not confined to rock 'n' roll.  this disc falls into their mersey-beat era but it is transitional as well and points to the future.  If you are someone who does not appreciate 50's rock,  or who does not appreciate early-mid sixties British pop and rock, look elsewhere I say.  To each his own.  If you like trippy music, try their later stuff.  This record is just really solid poprock, countryrock and plain old fashioned rock 'n' roll circa 1964.  Everyone else doesn't have to like it. In 1964-65, this was really good stuff.  I'm saying that and I'm not old enough to remember this disc being released.  But I do like a lot of sixties music and can recognize talent and creativity when I hear it.  This has always been one of my favorite Beatles albums because of the variety of music.  And the thing that I see most reviewers complain about, the lack of originals, is, to me, a bonus!  The Beatles were, first and foremost, a performing group.  The did play their instruments, and most of their early recordings were practically cut live, just the four of them playing and singing together.  Pretty amazing!  So this disc is a chance to hear those great cover version they used to play in the clubs with a little added production.  Pretty cool.  So , no.  I enjoy those covers as much as the originals.  As another reviewer stated so wisely,  this records \\"faults\\" are it's virtues. (I'm paraphrasing)  For me (and this is my opinion), this record, along with a few others, represents the Beatles very well.  And, by the way, all the years I have beenlistening to it, I never noticed that this album sound ragged and rushed.  Isn't that how they sounded night after night playing all those club dates from way back when?  And people still loved to hear them.

159448385X|4.0|Hosseini does it again with this often dark tale that ultimately leaves you exhausted with emotion.  I usually do not read books for the second time unless there is about a decade between readings, but I found this one at the library for 50 cents and could not hold back.<br /><br />Hosseini's characters come alive with such color and emotion that you find yourself so engaged that you have a hard time putting the book down.<br /><br />The main character, Mariam, follows a life of increasing pain but finds a way to embrace the love that falls into her lap.  With an honest heart she finds love and understanding in the children of her husbands new and younger wife.<br /><br />Through the toughest wartime nightmares you could imagine you find that even when things are tough love and family are what life is all about.  If you do not have love then you have nothing.  This fact was displayed clearly when Mariam eagerly gives all for her younger \\"sister\\" (co-wife).<br /><br />I learned a lot about life by reading this book and also thought about what makes one happy.  Sometimes I may see or think of people that are poor or living in a war torn place, but when all is said and done, the one I might pitty is the one in the mirror.  Life is truly what we make it and many \\"Americans\\" who chase the dollar and electronic/chemical distractions are the ones who have it all backwards or the ones who really need the pity.<br /><br />This story may change your life; give it a try.

B00006AFUR|4.0|Formed in 1998, 30 Seconds To Mars' debut album didn't arrive until 2002. Many people have described the sound of it as \\"space metal\\", and I'd say that's a pretty accurate term. I can pick out a lot of electronic influences; Deadsy, Nine Inch Nails, and a bit of Depeche Mode. Put those in a blender with some Tool and Rush (and some NASA footage) and you've got 30 Seconds To Mars.<br /><br />Dense walls of sustained guitar blanket nearly every track, with blocky keyboard textures filling in the spaces. There's an interesting amount of stuff that hasn't been used much by rock bands since the 80's (vocoders, synth-drums) and I can't really pick out the bass guitar (as so often goes in metal groups), but that's okay. Jared Leto's vocals are incredibly good, whether he's screaming his head off or going with a softer, more dramatic approach. As an actor and filmmaker, he already has a good sense of presentation and dynamics, so I give him credit for being a more than decent musician, songwriter and singer.<br /><br />Although he's the main driving force of the band, his brother Shannon (on drums) does a more than adequate job himself, providing fast rolls and interesting rhythmic changeups that are at times reminescent of Neil Peart (listen to that awesome reverb'd percussion intro/outro to \\"Echelon\\".)<br /><br />Some tracks stand out more than others, although every track is a winner if you hear it out of context. Sometimes when I play the whole album, the denseness of the guitars and vocals start to drag a little about 2/3rds of the way in, and I want it to hurry up and finish. Maybe a few tracks could've been trimmed and it would flow better.<br /><br />\\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\\" is a stunner of an opening, with uplifting chorus and almost hip-hop production on certain parts. \\"Edge Of The Earth\\" follows as the next blistering cut, with killer drum rolls and a stuttering synth line that blows me away every time. \\"Buddha For Mary\\" has some bitchin' vocoder on it (a criminally underutilised tool), and the background synth line is a dead ringer for the intro to Rush's \\"Tom Sawyer\\". \\"The Mission\\" has a fast-paced, punky vibe to it, while \\"Welcome To The Universe\\" is a 2+ minute dramatic interlude that reminds us we're flying through space. The album ends with a hidden track (\\"The Struggle\\"), an unsettling ambient piece with altered spoken word from someone quoting Sun Tzu's The Art of War.<br /><br />Apparently there's a loose concept to the lyrics of all the songs (they seem to all have a space and planetary theme), although I've never tried to connect the dots. I just sit back and enjoy the music.<br /><br />Import versions and various CD singles have some extra tracks. \\"Phase 1: Fortification\\" is another spacy, electronic song in the vein of the rest of the album, as well as \\"Revolution\\" (catch the Pink Floyd reference -- Hint: It has to do with producer Bob Ezrin) and the moody, ambient \\"Anarchy In Tokyo\\".<br /><br />Apparently this album wasn't terribly succesful upon its release. The band would hit bigger with the second single from A Beautiful Lie in 2006, a few years down the line. I find it strange that a lot of so-called \\"serious\\" music fans rip on this group, perhaps over their jealousy over the pretty-boy heartthrob image of Jared Leto. Personally, I think the guy is amazingly talented if a bit egoic at times (also, the band doesn't sound nearly as good live as they do in a studio), but that doesn't mean I shouldn't appreciate his honest attention to his art, of which has struck a chord with me on multiple levels.<br /><br />Recommended for open-minded listeners of alt-rock, prog-rock, and electronic space music with Sci-Fi themes.and the background synth line is a dead ringer for the intro to Rush's \\"Tom Sawyer\\". \\"The Mission\\" has a fast-paced, punky vibe to it, while \\"Welcome To The Universe\\" is a 2+ minute dramatic interlude that reminds us we're flying through space.

Recommended for open-minded listeners of alt-rock, prog-rock, and electronic space music with Sci-Fi themes.
1416594787|5.0|This is one of those books that you get the impression the author was sort of nagged or pressured into writing.  Dawkins' other works on biological evolution are less formulaic and you cover vast amounts of ground with a kindly guide. After years of confronting and being confronted by the \\"Scientific Creation\\" crowd, it's amazing that our favorite atheist doesn't come out swinging when doing a book specifically \\"proving evolution.\\"<br /><br />Instead of the anticipated acerbic rejoinders, we are cordially welcomed as if by an old friend and invited to sit and think things through. For me, one of the greatest gems came right at the start. Quoting Ernst Mayr, Dawkins demonstrates the influence of the old Platonic Ideals and how their logical contingencies forced human thinking into accepting the fixed species as having always been \\"fixed.\\" Removing this obstacle to thinking, he then goes on to inspire us further with the wonders of creation while documenting with overwhelming evidence the true record of natural history on our planet. I have stepped around this issue myself without really making the connections in biology that Dawkins does.<br /><br />My own experience tells me that very few Fundamentalist Creationists would be inclined to read this wonderful book. If however, you are open to wonder and enjoy the amazing panorama that surrounds us all, then this book is for you.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|This is a sophisticated and reflective Sting, the kind of music I love for being seasonal without being overtly Christmas-related. There are pieces for Christmas, but certainly not the traditional fare. This is Sting in a tender, firelight-enfused rendition of mostly new music. I'm enjoying this one!

0071636080|5.0|This is a great book and a simple read. I picked this book up and could not put it down. It is awesome, from the tips and tricks throughout the book, to the links to the videos found on Steve Jobs on YouTube, this is a must own book. I do presentations all the time and I am definately going to use some of these tips in this book.    To be fair to the readers in what you should expect, when we talk about Steve Jobs presentations, his presentations are on products, software, machines...etc, which are not common every day presentations. He also has some amazing graphic folks creating his presentations so I don't think even if we followed this book letter by letter we could ever produce the same level of presentations that Steve Jobs produces. But, that's not the point of this book, the point of this book is to provide readers tips that Steve Jobs uses on his presentations for you to take those same tips to apply them on your presentations.     I highly recommend this book!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The first fact to know about the mono set is that this is the way they were intended to be listened to: as monaural recordings.  This means that the levels of vocals and instruments are at their most optimal levels for easy hearing, and are as the artists and engineers intended them to be heard.  You can easily distinguish between instruments and the vocals. Ever wonder if its John singing double tracking or \\"Ken's flanger\\"? I think it is easy to distinguish on the mono's.  Another thing to know about this mono set is that starting after the Double White Album the engineering becomes directed towards stereo - thus the Abbey Road and Let It Be are NOT included in this set. But you do get all the singles (songs not released on official Beatles Albums) Another personal disappointment is the song \\"And I love Her\\" I expected the mono version to be identical with the mono version released on the Capital USA version which has Paul singing the entire song with no reverb - a superior delight - sorry to George Martin but the reverb ruined Paul's voice.  Instead you just get to hear his voice without reverb as on the stereo, only on the first line of the second verse.      Sgt. Pepper is super superior IN MONO! I believe that the stereo reproduction utterly ruins that entire album... and was the cause of my personal distaste for Sgt. Pepper, but now, hearing it in its original intended mono style I must admit, it is a wonderful creation of genius.      All the Beatles stereo mock-ups are inferior to the mono's in my opinion, except for their very first album \\"Please Please Me\\" where I prefer the stereo because it is great to be able to isolate and separate the vocal tracks completely from the instrumental tracks.      These are digital REMASTERS of the recordings so you get super clear first generation quality.

B0026P3G12|1.0|When I first hear Susan sing, \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" on Britain's Got Talent ... I was SOOO impressed, delighted, and happy for her (and for me because I got to enjoy it). In fact, to this date, I still go back and listen to her sing. I could listen to that rendition all night long ~ and sometimes i do!<br /><br />However, this entire album has no umph - no excitement ~ as if her energy and talent has been \\"tamed\\" down.<br /><br />Susan, PLEASE - I beg you - go back to the \\"real you\\" ~ the YOU with Passion, the you that said, \\"I'll show them!\\" AND show them, you did!!! Don't let those who are telling you what to do, tamper with your, \\"I'll show them!\\" attitude. We love the real Susan, the perky Susan, the Susan who proved she is MORE THAN AWESOME!<br /><br />So, Susan, do you know what I am going to do? Because I adore your \\"real\\" voice ~ the one that is powerful, happy, energetic, arrogant, confident, nervy ~ well, I am going to make copies of that original audition and listen to that instead of your new album.<br /><br />Remember when you stepped out of the stage for the first time and said, \\"Here's hoping?\\" ... well, I'm saying to you, \\"Here's hoping\\" ~ because I am really rooting for you!  with love, Judy

At first I wasn't sure about the music as it is different from the Pink Floyd that I am used to, but after listening to it a couple of times I can't wait to hear it again.

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|We've seen them play two awesome shows live, but I think we had just as much fun watching this DVD at home.  The video clarity and color is stunning in 1080p and the DTS-HD audio is exceptional.  The energy and excitement of The Killers show translates beautifully.  This is definitely one of those experiences that makes you happy you upgraded your home theater setup to HD.    This BluRay is a bargain at $15....I don't understand how you can be upset you didn't get an audio CD as well.  I also picked up the CD/DVD version for $13, added the CD to my digital library, and payed it forward by giving the standard CD/DVD to a friend.  Add another Killers fan to the list.    $28 for a BluRay and Audio CD?  I'll take that deal every day.
B002T45VX6|1.0|This is the worst Shakira CD I have ever bought.  Who produced this?  Brittany Spears?  It is truly awful.  You would think that someone this talented would not have to cater to the Bubble Gum/Dance Club crowd?  Long gone are the \\"Ladrones\\" CD.  I only liked track 6 and 7, the rest is Dance Club generic garbage.<br /><br />Shakira: A prime example of what happens when a great talent becomes totally Westernized.<br /><br />There is not one memorable track on this CD.  You would think Shakira who is super rich and talented could choose better material, I mean isn't she in her mid thirties?  And this CD is as hollow as a Saturday night at the Dance Club.<br /><br />One star.<br /><br />I'll sell you my brand new CD for $5, Actually if you come and get it, I'll just give it to you and consider it $9 down the toilet.  This will be the last Shakira CD I buy.<br /><br />Also, I would go so far as to say Shakira has no artistic integrity at all anymore and I feel she should issue an apology to her fans for this garbage, and she should send me a check for $9.99 so that I can get my money back.  What a sell-out!
0061684384|5.0|I am often disappointed in tattoo books with little story and the same old coverage of the history of tattooing.  I've also regretted purchases of books by high-profile folks with something to sell.  This is neither of the above.  This book is entertaining, visually stimulating, inspiring and packed full.  I'm really thrilled with this book.  Congrats Kat.  It's a winner.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had this watch for about 2 or three years now and still live it. Get comments on it all the time.
B002BPQ0Y2|3.0|After a couple playthroughs of the Album I still haven't figured out what direction B.E.P was trying to take with this, and I honestly don't think they knew either. They have always been diverse in their music, but its apparent in this CD that it is a bit disoriented.    Part of this is no doubt to Fergie and Will.i.am going independent with their own work and being quite successful with it. However it just doesn't fit into what is supposed to be the crew that we were expecting for a group album, they should have left the sidework as just that before they got together for this album. Don't get me wrong, they both do what they do best; due to my electro-fascination I definitely found a few gems here like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Rock Your Body\\" (Auto-Tune haters will be disappointed though). Will.i.am takes control in most of these tracks, but Fergie's contributions here (especially in \\"Missing You\\") are some of the best I've heard from her.    That's where my enjoyment ends though; the hip-hop side of the album is definitely not up to the level it should be, and while tracks like \\"One Tribe\\", \\"I gotta Feeling\\", and \\"Now Generation\\" are not bad, they feel more like campside music rather than whatever they were trying to aim for. While their older work managed to keep consistent themes, I feel like there were three or four themes thrown together (and not exactly representative of each group member) which makes it impossible for most people to enjoy the album in it's entirety, had they kept it more consistent like their previous work. It has been years since the group came together for another collabo, and I feel like too much irrelevant production from will.i.am/Fergie's own side-work, as well as the current mainstream made it into the album.    Also, note while there is no explicit label present, there is a good amount of explicit language and I feel this was another failure on the RIAA's part. Although I do prefer my music on the cleaner side, I'm not going to knock B.E.P for another company's mistake, and I don't mind as much if it's in good taste. The problem here is that it isn't; While F-words are censored (which I noticed in the preview, which led me to believe that the entire CD would be clean) that is definitely not the case; expect several forced S-words, N-words, and too much reference to the male genitalia. \\"Ring-A-ling\\" could have been a great track if it wasn't so immature; B.E.P is too old to still be pushing out that kind of music.    All that being said I think it's still a decent album, just know what you're getting. The Energy Still Lives here, but I feel like some things definitely have died.

B000002UVX|5.0|Protest songs don't usually make me ponder the Nature of Man's Soul. They usually don't allow for much speculation; they're pretty clear in letting you know who's right and who's wrong. The wrong guy is always That guy over there, but \\"Machine Gun\\" turns the sights around and puts the crosshairs squarely on the the head and heart of anyone who isn't as disgusted, outraged, bewildered by War as he is. Jimi doesn't let us think that we're the good guys who must oppose some outside force. He magically puts the machine gun in our hands, has us pull the trigger, and experience what it's like to take a life. He can do this so expertly because he knows exactly what it feels like to fire a machine gun. He was for a short time a private in the paratroopers, but was granted an early discharge. He traded in his M16 for a far more effective weapon. His Stratocaster explodes with mechanical ferocity, ripping open our crusty but tender souls with a torrent of apocalyptic mayhem. It's the most spectacular Theater of the Mind I've ever experienced. And he does all this at a New Year's Celebration Concert. So much for a Happy New Year to all.<br /><br />Except for a couple moments where Buddy Miles insists on slowing things up with some annoying call and response that is just a little too corny, the rest of the album is fantastic. Buddy occasionally slows things up with his plodding, leaden beats, too, and in the video of this show at one point Jimi turns around and gestures for the drummer to pick it up. Or at least keep up. Buddy was a semi-talent. Billy Cox is solid and always in the pocket and quick as a whip when he has to be.<br /><br />Although this album was released to fulfill contractual obligations, it's no minor effort. Rather, it works real well to demonstrate just how versatile and impatient Jimi's talent was. He wasn't able to settle for anything less than art and this album is necessary to everyone who loves great musical art.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|One of those rare albums where every song is good.  \\"Push\\", for me, shines most brightly, a tear-jerking, deeply felt recognition of another's best qualities.  \\"Time\\" also has a hook that you can't stop singing, and lyrics that keep running through your head.  Keep it up, Sarah!  This may be your best one yet.
B000002P5W|5.0|As a follow up to his monstrously great debut release, Jimi's \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\" proves itself to be the greatest 2nd album in the history of Rock. Or Music. It's packed with even more of the mind blowing sonic virtuosity that seemed to ooze from his every pore. We are treated to a phenomenal array of styles, tempos, and techniques. Opening with the quirky wild chirps and screeches of \\"EXP\\", we are on notice that there's some mighty strange magic to follow. \\"Up From The Skies\\" declares that Jimi wasn't just a great Rock & Roller, but a sincerely proud Soul Brother. \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" again has an announcement of its own, that this guy can get as syncopated and off-beat as any breathing jazz man. \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" is perhaps a throwaway nod to Brit Pop but still has a very heavy bottom and flashy riffs. \\"Ain't No Telling\\" gets R&B tones into the mix and rocks briefly before giving way to the gloriously simple and gentle masterpiece \\"Little Wing\\". \\"If 6 Was 9\\", a jewel in a funk jazz mood comes next. \\"You Got Me Floating\\" almost defies description, part funk, part rock, part soul. The combination is pure power. \\"Castles Made Of Sand\\" picks up where \\"Little Wing\\" leaves off, telling a bitter sweet tale of pain and loss by way of a funkified ballad. \\"She's So Fine\\" has Noel Redding's fingerprints on it and is a weak stab at Brit Psychedelic Pop, relieved only by Jimi's tight strumming and Mitch's rad beats. \\"One Rainy Wish\\" is great for its soulful waves of guitar laid over a mellow Mitch Mitchell patter. \\"Little Miss Lover\\" sears a scorching swath of molten rhythm over heavy, thumping bass. Real Heavy. And then, finally, it all culminates in the sprawling glory of \\"Bold As Love\\", a grand dense composition highlighting Jimi's growing prowess in the studio. Where the first album is a fantastic collection of classic Rock and Blues songs, \\"Axis\\" is a more sonically unified statement. There is something of a flow to the tracks, a dramatic progression. And, you get a sense of what he thinks and feels about other great albums, like \\"Sergeant Pepper\\", or \\"Pet Sounds\\". Making comparisons between Hendrix and The Beach Boys may sound absurd, but if you listen closely it's in there. In fact, it sounds like everything's in there. It's a melting pot, no, a Blast Furnace of American Music.a sense of what he thinks and feels about other great albums, like \\"Sergeant Pepper\\", or \\"Pet Sounds\\".

B002UXRH10|4.0|Rihanna's 2009 and fourth effort, \\"Rated R,\\" is the best album of her career and one of the best albums of the year. Why? This album dares to be different from the masses and previous Rihanna efforts, as she presents herself with more edge, sexier, daring, and more truthful than ever before.   The album starts with a small interlude titled \\"Mad House,\\" which really does a good job of setting the album's tone. \\"Wait Your Turn\\" is the first song on the album and it gets the listener vibing quickly. Rihanna gives no time for breath, as the album turns to \\"Hard\\" feat. Young Jeezy, followed by \\"Stupid In Love.\\" All of the tracks are creative, outgoing, and some of her best work. \\"Rockstar 101\\" is a bit corny, but the albums picks up again with the lead single \\"Russian Roulette.\\" The rest of the album continues like the first half, as all the songs present themselve with an edge and passion.   Rihanna really sheds her pop image with this album, as majority of the songs have a hard rock edge about them, with the exception of a few tracks. She's also cursing, as well as proudly presenting her bold personality and sexuality throughout the album's lyrics, and liner notes.   In my opinion, this is Rihanna's best album and one of the best albums I've heard this year. She took artistic chances with \\"Rated R,\\" changing her whole persona and agenda. This album seems more truthful than her previous three efforts.   Rihanna fans may not like this album if they're looking for her bubble-gum/pop albums of the past. She's definitely grown as a person and as an artist with this record. If you're wanting to hear a good album and have no preconceived notions going into it, buy \\"Rated R.\\"

I particularly like \\"Did it Again\\" and  \\"Gypsy\\".  And am sure I will be loving this CD.      Go girl !
B001GQSY5U|4.0|Though not the Star Wars I grew up with its still enjoyable. The action sequences, and there are a lot of them, look great. The character models though, the humans imparticular, I wish had a little more movement to them. They're too stiff and their hair looks like it was modeled out of Play-Doh. The acting also varies in this picture. While Hayden Christensen was bad in his two, the guy providing Anakin's voice in this is pretty good but some deliveries are flat and and unconvincing. James Arnold Taylor provides the voice of Obi-Wan who actually captures the character very well. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Daniels return to voice their characters though I hope Daniels and Jackson were well paid for about five minutes worth of dialog. I am glad though that Dooku is in it more but all he pretty much does is stand in front of Jabba the Hutt for the whole picture. The new character Ashoka voiced by Ashley Eckstein is annoying! I wish they never gave Skywalker a Padawan; she dress inappropriately for a Jedi apprentice, I hate the way she handles her lightsaber and I hate those stupid nicknames they give each other (though I am grateful that she doesn't call him SkyGuy hardly at all in the series). All in all it delivers but if I were Lucas, I wouldn't have put this in theatres to make a quick buck. It drags too long and would've been suited better for a TV movie than theatrical.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I don't buy many soundtracks because I usually only like a few of the songs, and really only parts of most of the songs.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|My brother told me about Turtle Beach headsets for months.  I have a PS3, Xbox 360 and now a Wii.  I had the regular ps3 blu tooth headset and the headset that comes with the 360.  What a joke!  I finally broke down and bought two of these Turtle Beach headsets, one for me and one for my husband since we have two ps3's.  We were blown away by the sound quality in ANY game. However, if you're playing shooter games, such as COD MW2 or COD4 without these, you have no idea what you're missing!!  With TB headset you can hear the enemy sneaking up behind you, you can hear flies buzzing near a dumpster, you can hear enemies reloading their guns, you can hear the fires crackling, the grenades sound like they just landed in your living room! I cannot say more, you just have to see for yourself if you want the best sound ever. They are great for ps3 blu ray movies too.  It's even better than the sound at a theater!  Yes, it's wired, 16 ft cord, but we find that's plenty.  You can also set your tv or stereo volume off and the TB headset sound will bother no one late at night!  (PS  I actually bought a 3rd set and shipped it overseas to a good friend of ours and he is just as blown away as we are!)
0446560065|4.0|I think we've gotten to the point where we're all pretty comfortable (or at least familiar) with the idea of the webcomic that is later turned into a book.  [[ASIN:B002BBRZWW Diary of a Wimpy Kid]] is the most famous example of this, but it happens all the time.  A webcomic becomes popular, and inevitably there's a print edition.  Far rarer is the webvideo that makes the successful leap from short film to paper.  Over the years the \\"Simon's Cat\\" web series has garnered millions of fans.  So obviously, a book was going to be the next step.  Considering how well Tofield animates cat behavior, you could be forgiven for not really believing that his images would translate to static comics.  As it happens, not all his images do work, but the bulk of them stand on their own very well and the result is a comic collection that improves on those old Garfield strips of yore.<br /><br />In hundreds of small comics, a neckless cat of indeterminate age or breed does the things cats do.  Destroys.  Yearns.  Yearns to destroy.  The images are simple pen-and-inks.  No color.  That's about the long and short of it, really.<br /><br />The reason the book version of \\"Simon's Cat\\" works is twofold.  First, Tofield doesn't caption his images.  There's a webseries out there (now also a book) called \\"[[ASIN:0345513878 Garfield Minus Garfield]]\\" which highlights how unfunny that particular cartoon cat is by removing him from comic strips, leaving only his owner.  It's a definite improvement.  \\"Simon's Cat\\", in contrast, uses visual gags entirely and it works so much better.  It's like watching a sitcom without an annoying laugh track.  You don't need words for certain kinds of visual storytelling.<br /><br />That's one.  The second reason this book works is that it's kid friendly.  It hasn't been specifically marketed to children, but kids will get a definite kick out of Tofield's small stories.  And as you read through it you begin to recognize reoccurring characters.  The garden gnome that the cat befriends.  The hedgehogs (betraying Mr. Tofield's homeland) in the garden or the birds and mice bent on torturing the poor kitty.  It all builds to a kind of conclusion.<br /><br />A lot of the time the gags are just one panel standing on their own.  Other times they go for several \\"scenes\\".  Strangely, you can never know when a gag will be one or another.  There's no rhyme or reason to how they're broken up.  Sometimes a gag will begin on a right-hand page and then you'll have to turn the page to get the rest.  Other times you feel like there should be more to the joke, but instead you're just left hanging.  It would have been nice if there was more consistency to the layout.  Still, I appreciated that the panels (which are never enclosed in boxes) shift from full-page spreads to eclectic sections of one page or another.  Your eyes are constantly moving and roving all over these pages.  It means that you don't get stuck in the same static way of reading each page.<br /><br />As for his art itself, you are never in doubt that this is a book created by a cat owner.  It's not so much the animal's body itself that tells you this.  Tofield's cats tend to have stocky little builds, resembling koalas or small panda bears rather than sleek handsome felines.  But in terms of movement he is dead on.  He's particularly good at drawing a cat mere moments before the pounce.  Those slicked back ears.  The way the pupils grow large.  You can practically see its little rump wiggling as it gets ready for a lethal leap upon some unsuspecting leaf or piece of fluff.<br /><br />As cat books go, this one's pretty much superior to the usual fare.  In terms of comics for kids, it reads like a collection of comic strips rather than a straight out graphic novel.  There's stuff I would have changed about it, but if you happen to know a kid or adult that thinks cats are the bees' knees AND they have a thing for comics, this is plain good stuff.  And maybe it's the first of its kind.  Maybe in the future it's all gonna be webvideos turned into collected comics.  Dunno.  One thing's for certain.  The cream usually rises to the top.  And \\"Simon's Cat\\", whatever else you might call it, is the best of its kind I've seen.<br /><br />Ages 8 and up.e webvideos turned into collected comics.  Dunno.  One thing's for certain.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Movie:  5/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  5/5  Overall:  5/5<br /><br />All the hype in the universe couldn't prepare me for the awesome experience of watching \\"Star Trek\\" '09 at the IMAX theater.  To start with, the movie has loads of awesome highly-developed special effects and action set pieces.  The movie as a whole is very intense.  As such, the camera does shake around quite a bit, making for a more dynamic viewing experience than the other \\"Star Trek\\" movies, but it may not appeal to everyone.  All of this is encased in an interesting story that very cleverly wraps up the old movie series and starts the series anew.  There are also quite a few homages to the former shows and movies, and some witty moments as well.  I'm also impressed as to how well the film captures the element of danger in space and extraterrestrial environments.  But the most attractive feature in this film is the characters; acting is practically perfect and their respective characters show decent depth.  Production design (sets, props, costumes, vehicles, weapons, etc) is well-conceived and quite interesting.  Music is not bad either.<br /><br />Some die-hard purists may hate this rendition for all its changes.  I myself consider this to be my favorite \\"Star Trek\\" film out of the whole lot.<br /><br />This disc set has perfect quality.  The picture looks very sharp and clean with good color and contrast.  A fine film grain structure is intact.  Sound quality (lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1) is awesome.  There are loads of extras in this set, spanning three discs (the third of which includes just a digital copy and a Xbox demo).  My copy came with a groovy slipcover.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I just listened to Susan Boyle's debut CD. First, let me say I will be buying her second CD, and probably many more after. Her voice is clear and lovely, and I too saw \\"the moment\\" on Britain's Got Talent.  That being said, I was slightly disappointed in this CD. While her voice is lovely, the tempo chosen for the tracks seems to be one. By the middle of the CD I was hoping for a more upbeat tempo... by the end I was feeling somewhat sad. Why not a song with a faster tempo? Yes, her voice was marvelous, but I am sure her voice would be just as marvelous with just a little more pizzazz to the tempo once in a while.  I enjoyed this CD. I enjoyed most of the songs.. I only wish something with a little more upbeat had been offered as well.

B001RTKXM8|5.0|Cedric Klapisch's 2008 film \\"Paris\\" leaves the mind brimming for days. The film's symphonic drama and stunning cinematography invite the viewer to contemplate how we all not only take life for granted, but also reduce the complex lives of others into simple stories.<br /><br />\\"Paris\\" showcases an ensemble cast, which includes the beautiful Juliette Binoche (Elise) from [[ASIN:B00005K3OT Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)]].<br /><br />Much like in Richard Curtis's 2003 British romantic comedy, [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)]], \\"Paris\\" charts the loosely-connected lives of several characters living within a big city (Paris as opposed to London). The characters' connections to one another are mostly happenstance, and often known only to the audience.<br /><br />The focal point of the film is the story of Pierre (Romain Duris), a retired cabaret dancer with a degenerative heart disease. Pierre needs heart bypass surgery. The doctor has told Pierre that he has a \\"50-50\\" shot of making it through the surgery.<br /><br />With an ailing heart, and no longer able to continue his dance career, Pierre spends his days in the company of his sister Elise, and her three children, wandering around his apartment, standing on his apartment's balcony, and looking at the Paris cityscape. Elise has taken time off work to be with her brother.<br /><br />Klipisch's film evokes Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, [[ASIN:B001CC7PPI Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)]]. Like with the protagonist of Hitchcock's [[ASIN:B001CC7PPI Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)]] James Stewart (Jeff Jefferies), Pierre is confined to his apartment. But Pierre is sidelined with an ailing heart, not a broken leg.<br /><br />Because Pierre's illness, unlike that of Jeff's, is life-threatening, his ruminations carry an existential weight that is utterly absent from that of Jeff's. Jeff in [[ASIN:B001CC7PPI Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)]] is more bored voyeur than brooding philosopher.<br /><br />Pierre's thoughts are concerned with loftier matters: the seeming obliviousness with which the inhabitants of Paris, a city teeming with life and business, take for granted their health.<br /><br />In the film, on a number of occasions, Klapisch fills the screen with the solitary image of a confined Pierre gazing out his apartment window, like an explorer standing on a cliff's edge above the ocean. Below Pierre, the cityscape of Paris unfolds with the ebullient color palette of a [[ASIN:0714838926 Sisley]] painting. In [[ASIN:B001CC7PPI Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)]], Jeff's gaze is trapped within the borders of a dark, confined Greenwich Village courtyard.<br /><br />Only on a few occasions does Pierre's gaze ever stray into a neighbor's window - through the apartment window of the beautiful M&eacute;lanie Laurent (Laetitia). Pierre's brief, voyeuristic foray is only a function of his existential angst - time is potentially running out for him to make love one last time. He is thinking Laetitia may be for him a possible lover; the audience knows the futility with which his hopes rest (Laetitia is already entangled in two coinciding love affairs - and Pierre is an awkward lover).<br /><br />The tight borders that confine the world, which Jeff spends his days observing in [[ASIN:B001CC7PPI Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)]], lead only to him getting entangled in a murder investigation. But Paris for Pierre conjures up meaning and clairvoyance. Paris helps Pierre make sense of his situation. The expansiveness of the world he contemplates provides him with a perspective he has never had before.<br /><br />The film ends with Pierre riding in a cab to his heart surgery, staring longingly out at the city that he fears he will never see again. On the ride, Pierre points to the spiritually-lost Fabrice Luchini (Roland Verneuil) strolling down the sidewalk, and proclaims that he wishes he could be like Roland (to Pierre, a stranger), carefree and healthy.<br /><br />But Roland is far from carefree. He is a self-absorbed, middle-aged man, who had just had his hopeless affair with one of his students (Laetitia) end nastily. Roland's isolation is compounded by his father's recent death, and the contempt with which he treats his brother, and what he views as his brother's conventional life. Roland, by indulging in his own fear of loneliness, over the course of the film, only becomes lonelier.<br /><br />As a healthy stranger walking the streets of Paris, Roland is to Pierre someone of whom to be jealous. Through Pierre's reduction of Roland's life, and his reduction of the lives of all the other strangers walking the city-streets of Paris, Klapisch illuminates an important irony.<br /><br />The perspective that Pierre finds in his personal wrangling with death is also blinding; Pierre is a poor empathizer (he covets the life of a man who is clinically depressed and utterly lost). Even the vilest of men to Pierre become romanticized - and with great reason - they have life! At least on the surface, they have life. Locked in the shackles of his self-absorption, what kind of life does Roland really have?<br /><br />Towards the end of the film, a minor character, Caroline, played by Julie Ferrier, catapults to her death in a motorcycle accident, highlighting a second irony in Pierre's situation.<br /><br />Pierre's awareness of his own situation imprisons him. The unfairness of his situation seems far less unfair when compared to Caroline's. Pierre has a 50-50 shot of living. Caroline is dead. But Pierre, if he saw Caroline zooming on her motorcycle the very day she died, would have probably thought - if only I could be like that woman! Carefree and healthy! Zooming around like there is no tomorrow!<br /><br />How can we gain the perspective that the imminence of our own mortality provides us, when our mortality is not imminent? For Roland and Caroline, and everyone else for whom death is seemingly far-off, mortality is more a source of anxiety than clairvoyance.<br /><br />Perhaps the average citizen's obliviousness to mortality is what frustrates Pierre the most. Pierre cannot help but to lament that his experience is lost on millions of people, as they buzz around Paris like a bee colony, answering to the needs of their everyday lives, while Pierre consciously and quietly marches to his own end.aged man, who had just had his hopeless affair with one of his students (Laetitia) end nastily.

B0026P3G12|3.0|The Cd is pleasant enough but lacks the passion and spunk she seemed to display on Britian's Got Talent.  I've only seen her give the one amazing performance and then all others have been off.      I have to wonder if she'd be quite as impressive if she weren't viewed so harshly for her looks initially.  She's a good singer but hardly earth shattering or ground breaking.      Some of the songs just don't work for her either as they seem out of place with her singing them.
B000002KAT|5.0|Van Morrison's 1968 album is a brash testament to youth. In this album, the young Morrison - with his emotive guitar playing, scrappy, soulful vocals, and elusive lyrics - plays the cocksure Romantic poet, certain only of his muse-inspired vision. On this album Morrison plays his music his way.<br /><br />I specify \\"young\\" because it is almost impossible to imagine this album spawning from a middle-aged man. Van Morrison conceived this album before the greediness of the recording industry and the waning inspiration that comes with the passage of time had sucked out some (although certainly not all) of his vigor. On \\"Astral Weeks\\", Morrison plays the optimistic poet, ready and willing to expose his vision bare.<br /><br />\\"Astral Weeks\\" was completed across three recording sessions that took place at the Century Sound Studios in New York on September 25, October 1 and October 15, 1968. From all accounts they were more like jam sessions - Van's backup musicians trying to figure out what the guy from Belfast was doing, how to drop rhythm under Van's scatting, improvisational vocals.<br /><br />Lester Bangs (the great Rolling Stone critic) has already paved so well the ground I tread now- that of contemplating this album.<br /><br />In his review, Bangs called the album both the \\"rock record with the most significance in my life so far\\" and \\"the product of an era.\\" \\"Astral Weeks\\" is indeed a product of its era. But it also transcends all eras. I first encountered \\"Astral Weeks\\" more than 30 years after Morrison recorded the album. Its power moved me as it did Bangs decades previously.<br /><br />Van Morrison's creation transcends time because of its poetical and ambitious reach, emotional power, and interpretive ambiguity. The album's lyrics are like Silly Putty - to be shaped in the hands of the listener.<br /><br />Take the opening lines from the song \\"Beside You\\":<br /><br />Little Jimmy's gone way out of the back streets<br />Out of the window, into the falling rain<br />And he's right on time, right on time<br />That's why broken arrow waved his finger<br /><br />Down the road so dark and narrow<br />In the evening just before the Sunday sixbells chime<br />And way out on the highway<br />All the dogs are barkin' way down below<br /><br />And you wander away from your hillside retreated view<br />Went to wanderin' Nordhbridge way out on the railroad<br />Together all the tipping trucks will unload<br />All the scrapbooks built together stuck with glue<br />And I'll stand beside you, beside you<br /><br />Morrison's lyrics and symbols are both highly personal and adaptable at the same time. The essence of Morrison's music is something listeners for decades have been able to adopt as their own.<br /><br />Underlying this mysterious, haunting, touching album is a redemptive quality - a horn rumbling through dense fog, showing us the way.roken arrow waved his finger    Down the road so dark and narrow  In the evening just before the Sunday sixbells chime  And way out on the highway  All the dogs are barkin' way down below    And you wander away from your hillside retreated view  Went to wanderin' Nordhbridge way out on the railroad  Together all the tipping trucks will unload  All the scrapbooks built together stuck with glue  And I'll stand beside you, beside you    Morrison's lyrics and symbols are both highly personal and adaptable at the same time.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is a great upbeat album, even better than I was expecting and very enjoyable. I definitely recommend it!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|As with all art forms, the perspective bought into the mix totally defines the impact.  This was an excellent screen adaptation of the award-winning play by director, John Patrick Shanley  which ultimately resulted in a uniquely liberating, somewhat painful, yet truly thought-provoking viewing experience.  Kudos goes to the principal players, Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis and Joseph Foster, all of whom gave wrenching award-worthy performances.<br /><br />The story is set in the mid-sixties, not long after the assassination of JFK.  A Catholic school in the Bronx accepts its first black student, Donald Miller, beautifully portrayed by Joseph Foster. The priest, wonderfully realized by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is truly empathetic and realizing what a struggle it must be for the student, keeps an eye on him to make sure he adjusts well to this new and very intricate situation.  Because of his attention, one sister, a very effective Amy Adams, initially becomes slightly suspicious of his motives and, unfortunately, reports her suspicions to the principal, an exceedingly pedagogical nun, exquisitely played by Meryl Streep. She, of course, confronts the priest with her suspicions which he vehemently denies and she steadfastly refuses to believe.  She even confronts the boy's mother, portrayed by Viola Davis who gives a wrenching performance.  The encounter between these two is as taut and revealing as those between the accusing nun and the outraged priest.  The overall dialogue is crisp, biting, poignant and positively riveting.<br /><br />Certain aspects of this whole scenario evoked poignant memories making it rather easy for me to relate to.  Moreover, certain revelations the mother made to the nun re the boy's home life raised VERY serious questions.  These questions will be at the focal point of any discussions about the play for the simple reason the author wisely neither confirmed nor denied those suspicions which, obviously, was pivotal to the whole theme.  Any \\"doubts\\" you find yourself faced with while watching this further fuels the profound impact the film makes because in the final analysis, it will be up to the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions - as well it should be.  The ending is little short of devastating.<br /><br />With such a riveting and important play being realized by a positively flawless cast, this could hardly miss.  Just eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeescellent.  I hiiiiiiiiihgly recommend!!!!otal to the whole theme.

B001GMH8RO|4.0|Great movie with a special cast. Patrick and Whoopi have special chemistry very rarely seen in movies.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|These are HD DVD's need an HD DVD player. Regular DVD Player or BD Player won't play these discs.
B000002KBA|5.0|It is obvious listening to this that Deep Purple were the highest order musicans who just happened to choose hard rock. Pre-Gillian Purple was, in fact, semi-classical, and Ian Gillan had the vocal chops to sing in Jesus Christ Superstar.<br /><br />And if you take a careful listen to In Rock, you will hear it IS, in fact, progressive rock. Just with taste. heavy? Absolutely. Some of the hardest rock out there  in 1970. You could scare your parents with In Rock, back when hard rock was truely a musical and social threat.<br /><br />But if you listen to the organ solo on \\"Speed King,\\" you can hear both Bach and Larry Young. \\"Bloodsucker\\" has complicated riffs and stops Blue Cheer and even Black Sabbath could not touch for their level of complication. \\"Child In Time\\" is almost classical and opera--which Gillan could have sang anytime he wanted.<br /><br />I also have to take large hats off to Rodger Glover, perhaps the rock era's most underrated and underappreciated bassist. Listen to some of his work on Fireball--\\"No No No\\" comes to mind, and you hear he could funk and duel with Chris Squire, Greg Lake, all the other heavies. Glover locks in by choice, hiding his briliance in subtle little runs and rock solid time. He is minimal by choice, and as with any great musican, chosen restraint is facinating to hear.<br /><br />This is blasting metel that holds up forty years on, but for fans of really good, complex music, In Rock holds plenty for you. The wealth is all in the details, which you hear once your eardrums start working again.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|It looks like the same reviews appear for all the versions. I'm writing about the blu-ray editions, which have been remastered from the original.    The blu-ray version of this favorite P&P is absolutely gorgeous. It's impossible to exaggerate the improvement in the color and detail. Every minute you'll notice details you never noticed, like embroidery in clothing and colored jewels. My wife and I had watched the DVD version many times, and when we saw this we commented continually on things we were seeing for the first time. I could go on and on with examples, but I'll just say that if you love this series, it's worth buying a blu-ray player just to see it. If you already own one, then buying this version of P&P is a no-brainer. Throw those washed-out DVD's in the trash! New blu-ray extras to boot on the 29-dollar version.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Prior to buying my cd I'd only listened to the 30-second clips of each track. When I finally heard each complete song, I was totally mesmerized.  What a wonderful job Susan and her team did on this first album!    I'd already fallen in love with \\"Wild Horses\\".  I thought changing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" around a bit added something to it.  It started off soft and gentle and gradually built up to where Susan could really belt it out and then became soft and gentle again.  I liked the touch of guitars also and the rumble of thunder.  Very well done indeed.  I liked \\"Cry Me a River\\" even better than her earlier version -- I just wish it had been a little longer.  She can really sing jazz.  Loved \\"You'll See\\" and the dramatic orchestra effect.  I preferred her version to Madonna's.  \\"Daydream Believer\\" was a surprise.  I didn't think I was going to like it, but it grew on me and I started humming it off and on all day long.  Now it's one of my favorites.  Never liked \\"Up to the Mountain\\", but I do like her version.  She's really showing her versatility here.  She sounds like a true gospel singer for sure!  I'm not really a lover of hymns, but the two on this album are great and she does a wonderful job with them.  Elvis used to put hymns in his albums, and it never seemed to hurt him -- so, it's probably a good move!  \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" and \\"Proud\\" literally blew me away.  I can't decide which I like better.  They are the tracks I keep playing over and over again and the ones that make me cry.  I think they are both pure genius and she sings them like no one else could.  I've always liked \\"The End of the World\\", and Susan does a great job with this song also.  \\"Silent Night\\" is as beautifully done as any versions that I've heard.    I think this was an excellent debut album in which to showcase her voice, her range, her versatility, and the way she manages to put passion into her songs.  There are a lot of covers, sure, but personally I like to hear songs I'm familiar with and there are songs I'd like to hear her sing on a second album.  I'm not a big fan of all original songs.  I like what I like.  And, I like Susan.

I would recommend them to others and would purchase from them again as well! One other thing, I was extremely pleased with the shipping time of this product. Eventhough it says the standard shipping time, I received mine in less than 1 week! Thanks!
B000RZIGVS|3.0|To get the complete serie at this price is a great deal. However one must accept some compromise. The disks packaging is quite fragile with the plastic disk holders separating at the first use. There is also some quality issue with some of the disks that rumble loudly while spinning and will sometime not load unless the CD tray is opened and then closed a few times. I have several DVD players and only one of those is able to play any and all disks. Regardless, I still recommend it for someone that has a good high end DVD player and has a little patience...

B002X063OC|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm not a special music critic, so I take this album by my taste by all means.<br /><br />In spite of being a re-release of one of the decade's most tremendously successful albums \\"The Fame\\", \\"The Fame Monster\\" was initially regarded as \\"another\\" stupid compilation from the label records when they expect the fans and customers to spend another $15 on something they've practically already had, with a few more songs and a different cover. To prove the point of seeing through the ruse and \\"everything for my fans\\", Lady GaGa doesn't disappoint her little monsters at all. To an extent, this is totally a whole new album with new 8 songs. Lady GaGa added nearly an entire album's worth of new material to her already existing \\"The Fame\\" and skipped the filmsy term \\"bonus track\\", which made the whole album look/sound like a perfect companion to her original \\"The Fame\\". This album is completely worth the wait, and in my own opinion, this is one of the best albums I've heard in years.<br /><br />About Lady Gaga's music style, she does dance-pop, which isn't new or revolutionary. Lady GaGa had her own way to spice her style up. Aside from the crazy outfits she usually shows up to the public with, whatever GaGa has devoted to music is fire. If \\"The Fame\\" was to set a new level of dance pop music in 2008, keep the same thought for \\"The Fame Monster\\", but in a darker way. Lady GaGa's music this time is much more mature. She spent a lot more time in the studio working with 6 notorious hitmakers (Fernando Garibay, RedOne, Space Cowboy, Darkchild, Teddy Riley, Ron Fair) which will assure her album to be just another success. Every song in this album is a masterpiece, and it's really premature for anyone to underestimate it.<br /><br />I love all of the songs, and I found it impossible to pick a favorite one. I'd pick Alejandro or Monster to be the best tracks off the album; Telephone with Beyonce will be smash hit on the radio for sure, Speechless is in a completely different league, and Dance in The Dark's chorus will haunt you for days. In my opinion, Lady GaGa has done it again. The counterpoint to \\"The Fame\\" contains no songs about money or fame. Each song shows a different point of views from GaGa, or should I say fear: alcohol, drugs, sex, loneliness, death... And she does her job in an extremely fantastic way. I just lost my words for it.<br /><br />* Added: By the time I write this review, \\"Bad Romance\\" has already reached #1 on iTunes chart. And \\"The Fame Monster\\" is also at #1 for albums. Amazing!<br />* Added: On 11/23/2009, she'll sign CDs for her fans in Los Angeles at night. There were 3000 people in front of the store 10AM already, and Gaga bought the fans pizza so they didn't have to starve. She wrote on her Twitter page \\"Little monsters, eat up! I love you.\\"<br /><br />Classy.n The Dark's chorus will haunt you for days. In my opinion, Lady GaGa has done it again. The counterpoint to \\"The Fame\\" contains no songs about money or fame.

B002T45VX6|5.0|I have been a long time follower and fan of Shakira since Pies Descalzos. I have to admit that I love everythings she puts out there. She has grown as an artist and \\"She Wolf\\" proves it. Shakira said from the begining tha this would be more a dance album and very electronic, so that is what we got. She is experimenting and I truly admire someone that can step out of their comfort zone and succeed. I can't wait for the spanish album out next year!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|There are only a few tracks on this album, but they're all great. Bad Romance set a new standard for Lady Gaga, and it might be her best song to date.<br /><br />I was a little confused about why my copy was censored, but I don't know if this is because I purchased it from Best Buy or if all cuts of the album censored the songs. It doesn't matter because this is a great cut and fun to listen to. Highly recommended.

Instead we get somewhat predictable and rather formulaic songs like A WHITER SHADE OF PALE, PATTERN OF MY LIFE and SHINING lIGHT.<br /><br />I do not know why MEDUSA and BARE are woefully under-represented especially as A WHITER SHADE OF PALE is the dullest track on the whole MEDUSA album. I CAN'T GET NEXT TO YOU, DON'T LET IT BRING YOU DOWN, DOWNTOWN LIGHTS, TRAIN IN VAIN, THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE are all amazing interpretations that have stood the test of time.<br /><br />In fact THIN LINE... has to be, in my opinion on of the greatest cover versions I have ever heard: the close vocal really gives a sense of underlying menace to the song. And on BARE, why is HONESTLY not included? It has it all , melody, lyrics and a wonderful \\"contrapuntal\\" verse she sings in accompaniement to the main verse.  Also I would have loved to see BITTER PILL and ERASED on the compilation to show the more ballsy side of Annie.<br /><br />I really think Annie should release a more comprehensive album than this. there was plenty of room on Disc 2 for many more tracks.  I know it consists of rarities and out-takes. But that voice of hers needs to be shown in all its glory<br /><br />This is a very safe collection and rarely shows the daring groundbreaking Annie Lennox that we love<br /><br />For a single cd collection, I would have chosen the following songs:<br /><br />WHY<br />WALKING ON BROKEN GLASS<br />PRECIOUS<br />LITTLE BIRD<br />NO MORE I LOVE YOUS<br/>TRAIN IN VAIN<br />WAITING IN VAIN<br />THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE<br />PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN YOUR HEART<br />A THOUSAND BEAUTIFUL THINGS<br />PAVEMENT CRACKS<br />HONESTLY<br />LOVE SONG FOR A VAMPIRE<br />LADIES OF THE CANYON<br />INTO THE WEST<br />GHOSTS IN MY MACHINE<br />DARK ROAD<br />SING<br /><br />If I could add a second cd, the possibilities are limitless!
B000083C49|4.0|Str Trk 4 : Whales    The crew of the innrprize are on sporks planet and they hear that there is this big piece of poo in space that is headed to earth and is going to blow it up a lot. this is like vag'na from the first movie but instead of a mind melt they need whales. Spork is still out of it and is wearing a bathrobe and they all decide that they are going to hang a u-turn around the sun to go back in time to 1980s where there are lots of whales cause there aren't any humpbacks in the future. THIS WORKS! They end up in San Fran and land their invisible plane in the park and someone sees them and is all like \\"WHAAAAA\\" but he's a bum so noone will believe him. they hang out in San Fran for awhile and spork makes a headband so he's all like Rambo now and kills a punk rocker on the bus cause his music is TOO LOUD! Kork flirts with this 80s chick and Scotchy speaks into a mouse and then everyone is freaked out that Checkoff is a russian. Spork swims with the whales and then they go back to the future and the big thing is like \\"FINE!\\" and then it leaves.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|\\"Food, Inc.\\" strives to be an expos&eacute; of the American agricultural industry and a public service announcement that encourages the public to learn more about the food they eat and vote with their wallets at the grocery store. The film is narrated by Eric Schlosser, author of \\"Fast Food Nation\\", and Michael Pollan, author of \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" and \\"The Botany of Desire\\", all books that in some way discuss how food has been transformed by human design and its results. \\"Food, Inc.\\" tries to cover a lot of territory, resulting in a film that is a bit fractured and uneven. We get a lot more information about some facets of modern American agriculture than others.<br /><br />The impact of changes in how food is created in the past few decades, with increasing homogenization and the move from farms to a factory-created food supply, is a huge topic that could hardly be covered in a thousand pages, much less in an hour-and-a-half film. So \\"Food, Inc.\\" concentrates on a few topics that director Robert Kenner must have thought dramatic enough to get the public's attention: the mistreatment of animals and farmers in the chicken industry, the rise in deadly e. coli 0157:H7 infections due to industrial beef production, and the obesity and diabetes that has resulted from cheap, abundant, federally subsidized corn.<br /><br />There is a lack of cohesion that does not always serve the arguments well, but the topics are related. For example, the high populations of e. coli in cows is due to their being fed corn instead of grass, because federal subsidies of corn allow companies to buy it at less than the price of production. Corn products are in nearly all processed foods, putting Americans on a very unhealthful diet of cheap calories from high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates. The segment on the beef industry focuses on the causes and consequences of uniformity. When the dominant buyer of a product (e.g. McDonald's is the largest purchaser of beef and potatoes in the US) demands a uniform product, the industry must transform itself  to meet that demand.<br /><br />Some of the problems are unintended consequences of efforts to create an abundant and efficient food industry, while others are unethical or willfully ignorant behavior on the part of industry. The criticism of \\"Food, Inc.\\" that I hear most frequently is that it doesn't present an alternative method of feeding the Earth's 6 billion inhabitants. But it doesn't need to. Sustainable agriculture works well on a large scale; monoculture is unsustainable by the agricultural industry's own admission; we are inundated with corn products not because we need them but because of subsidies; we produce too much food. Better, safer food is more expensive, but the prices of the junk are artificially depressed. And the federal government will be forced to reduce its agricultural subsidies in the coming decade anyway.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features are 8 deleted scenes, 7 celebrity public service announcements about nutrition and food safety, a list of web site \\"Resources\\", an ad (text) for \\"Food, Inc: The Book\\", a theatrical trailer (2 min) and 2 featurettes. \\"ABC News Nightline: You Are What You Eat\\" (7 min) is a segment that aired June 16, 2009. Steve Ells, founder of Chipotle Grill, talks about the farm-raised meat that his restaurants use. \\"The Amazing Food Detective\\" (3 min) is a cartoon created by Kaiser Permanente to discourage children from eating junk food. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish.uniform product, the industry must transform itself  to meet that demand.

0143034901|5.0|I adore Carlos Ruiz Zafon. He is one of my favorite authors writing today. Until I discovered his paperback version of Shadow of the Wind on a cold December day, I was only reading and re-reading classic literature.<br /><br />Thank you for this fantastic tale and others Carlos!! I look forward to more books by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. What a treat to read this author!
B002H3F7F6|4.0|That's how I feel as I listen to this CD on a cold dreary day. Transported to a deeper time, an ethereal time. This is not the collection for people who can't get enough chestnuts roasting on an open fire , or those who dream of a white Christmas. But if you enjoy the unusual, if you can respect an artists desire to stretch our imaginations and if you are willing to expand your horizons then this album will be like a warm mug of wassail on a cold winter's day.

B0026P3G12|4.0|There is no question about the days of Youtube, and how much they can make you an even more interesting star than you even seem to realize. That does come with so many different shapes and forms, but when you have a striking voice, it can catch you by surprise. That honestly has come with the case of Susan Boyle. Ever since she graced the stage on the show Britain's Got Talent, the U.K. version of America's Got Talent, she definitely brought out a huge worldwide sensation that definitely became a huge home run of talent. While Susan did sadly lose the competition of the U.K. dance group, Diversity, there has been so much about the way Susan can sing. Well, that strike of the moment has been put to the ultimate test, with her debut album. But, the question is that is it worth effort where she sang she dreamed a dream? Well, mostly yes and no.<br /><br />Susan Boyle's debut record I Dreamed A Dream, is a very soulful and intimate album that really can be striking at most times, but there are a few faults. Nevertheless, her feeling of vocals catches the eye that matches the strength that has shown mostly well to compare to others' like the legendary Barbara Streisand and her musical longevity. The collection though of songs in the album, is mainly cover material, and not anything songs that are fresh and organic. Nevertheless, Susan really does showcase mostly well through her covers, including a striking and intimate cover of Madonna's You'll See, which actually delivers a bravado deeper than when Madonna did it back in 1995, as well as the standards like Amazing Grace, the song which she had performed on Got Talent, I Dreamed A Dream and the classic Christmas song Silent Night in time for the holidays. While most of the songs are good, there are some covers that are weak like her rendition of The Monkees classic Daydream Beliver which are weak, and I really don't see in the picture of her mind simply singing and weigh the album down a bit.<br /><br />Overall, despite a few weak songs, I Dreamed A Dream is mostly a strong album from Susan Boyle. Though I honestly did wish she did more organic songs that weren't covers to make the album shine better, than nearly all covers to make all her own. Nevertheless, she does have a unique voice that really does have a possibility of standing the test of time. I do hope though there are more new songs from the next record, not almost all covers like this one. For a lady whom had never been kissed in her life, she made a lot of people feels like they've kissed her from the beauty fo the voice within.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B-s, I Dreamed A Dream is mostly a strong album from Susan Boyle.

B0012M4OUW|5.0|Because I lost mine Zippo when I was on holiday and I wanted a new one I ordered one again, the service was amazing, got it in les than 5 days (shipped to the Netherlands), even the price was less than the other one. I'am very pleased with this one, works fine.
B002E01LL6|3.0|The movie was not bad as an overall movie.<br />The plot was believable and logical.<br />The acting, while not shining, was decent for the situations it represented.<br />Gritty, urban, crowded, dirty, New york was a great backdrop for this type of movie.<br /><br />The fight scene with the Dragon Le was the best one in my opinion.<br />Shawn's brawler style was a good contrast to Dragon's more classically oriented style.<br />This fight should have been the end fight and lasted longer.<br /><br />Or they could have made the fight with Evan more crisp instead of an unskilled schoolyard like fight.<br />The fighters breaking down walls and disturbing the guests did not make up for the fact that it was contrived and uninspiring as a final match.<br /><br />I liked the romantic tension between Shawn and Zulay. She was attractive with the benefit of a common sense and life experience that flavored her character.<br />Terence Howard did quite well.  The whiny voice did not fit the character he portrayed, but his actions fleshed out the trials of the washed up betrayed fighter turned promoter.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice tepid movie with a bit of excitement and a nice underdog storyline I definitely recommend this movie.<br />But if you are actually looking for a youthful fighting movie I would recommend Never Back Down.<br />Cookie cutter as it may seem to some, the fight scenes and training scenes were pretty nice.<br />I also recommend RedBelt for a more mature version of Fighting with a bit more of a darker and stronger feel.
B000I0QK74|2.0|I have nothing specifically against James Taylor but this is one of the most boring albums in existence, Christmas or otherwise.     Everything on this album is a complete snooze-fest, Christmas never sounded so depressing!    I've also never heard anyone destroy Jingle Bells as bad as this man. It's not a very good song to begin with and he somehow found a way to make it worse.     You're better off spending a few extra bucks and getting [[ASIN:B002QCKOME Midwinter Graces]] by Tori Amos.       [[ASIN:B002QCKOME Midwinter Graces]] combines interestingly interpreted and modified originals like What Child/Nowell and Jeanette, Isabella with solid original songs. Most importantly it has varied sounds and well-executed instrumentals that make the monotony of James Taylor at Christmas seem almost criminal.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|This set is amazing!  It is all 4 movies for a very low price of 10 bucks.  I picked this up at my local Target on Thursday and watched all the batman movies through the weekend.  This set includes four Batman films.  Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), and Batman & Robin (1997).  The special features include some character facts and production notes.  It is all very basic reading material on the disc, but I found a lot of it to be very interesting.  They could have had absolutely no special features at all, and I still would think this set is worth it!  Is this set better than the Motion Picture Anthology?  Well it depends on how much you care about these movies to want to watch all the special features for them.  I would say I wouldn't mind watching the special features of the first two movies, but the last two I could do without.  As far as the price goes, this set is better because it is only 10 bucks and the anthology is $80.  As far as picture quality goes, all the films looked great to me.  You can't really go wrong with this release, you get 4 films for 10 bucks in a single DVD case on 2 discs (and the discs are double sided with one movie on each side for those worried about compression)!  Talk about saving shelf space!  I am thinking of buying the other sets in this series like the superman and matrix collections and replacing my existing DVDs with them just to save shelf space alone!  Anyways this is the first of the \\"4 film favorites\\" collections that I have bought and I am very happy with the purchase.  Sure not ALL the films are that great, but your going to be spending more than 10 bucks for just one of these films and I can tell you that 2 of the films should be owned by everyone.
160094048X|5.0|I've been looking forward to this book since I realized it was coming out. Moskowitz and Romero are the authors of two of my favorite cookbooks, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World, and Veganomicon, and I've come to rely on them for sure-thing recipes. Cookies are my choice indulgence so I'm thrilled to have Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar.<br /><br />I just got it, so I haven't had time to try all of the recipes yet but I can vouch big time for the Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows--dramatic presentation and yummy! I can't wait to try the Key Lime Cookies, Lazy Samoas, and Chocolate Chip Biscotti. This is perfect timing for the holidays! There's nothing like a nice assortment of cookies on the table for parties and desserts.<br /><br />The recipes are straightforward and the tone is entertaining. There is a warmth and sense of humor that pervades. I love the way they understand their readers and can anticipate little tidbits we need to know, like how and when to make substitutions and cookie troubleshooting. They have a gluten free flour mix for those who need that option and a primer on ingredients.<br /><br />This book has lots of fab photos and is the sister book to their cupcake book--same format. It's funky and fun and would make an awesome holiday gift for vegans and non-vegans alike. Highly recommended for every kitchen!
B000086EOB|4.0|WASP is so much better when Stet Howland isn't in the band.  Blackie was smart to fire that idiot.  I know nobody really knows who he is as he's nothing more than a bar star.  Such a loser.  LONG LIVE WASP!  Great album - great songs.
0316113506|4.0|This is a decent book with an optimistic message. We can alter our brain growth, chemistry and function by the simple expedient of moving ourselves and doing some exercise. The exercise will boost our physical and mental effectiveness, and counteract, or prevent entirely, our tendencies to be anxious, down, depressed, irritable, poor concentration or \\"hormonal\\". Exercise will boost the function of our brains and our bodies to our own and our family's, friends' and colleagues' benefits.<br /><br />Exercise does this by boosting BDGF and rebalancing the levels of sertraline, norepinephrine (noradrenalin) and dopamine and by helping it get the right balance of excitatory and inhibitory traffic across synapses. The microscopic effects lead on the good macroscopically observable (psychological) effects we can feel and observe. Oh and the exercise is helping your body develop well too.<br /><br />By the time you have read this book you will have come to realise that exercise is a GOOD THING for your brain and your body. As animals we are meant to move, and we feel better when we travel a certain distance each day under our own efforts.<br /><br />The real question is does the author establish his case fully? I think mostly he does, but we are taking a lot on trust here. It is obvious in the text that at times the author is referring to specific papers (as he should be in a text making large claims as this one does). The corresponding references are not given so we have to take the author's assertion and we cannot check the references for ourselves. So we are having to take the facts presented on trust...although the author does come across as trustworthy. The lack of references does make for faster reading, but as the book is not long they could have been given.(..or maybe the modern way would be to put the links on a website?)<br /><br />The second potential drawback of this book is that exercise comes across as a bit of a panacea, which it isn't. I know this book is written as advocacy, but a bit of perspective and review wouldn't go amiss. There's an element of preaching in the book which is within tolerable limits.<br /><br />The basic thesis of this book is that mental dysfunction is often a reflection of our sedentary and stressed lifestyles and that seems a reasonable proposition. The idea that thinking is a motor act, and intimately related with movement is plausible. The idea that exercise will help a lot of people with mental health problems to get better is one that I hope will become more widespread with time. It offers many people a way out of mental illness that is entirely self help, drug free and readily available. I hope the ideas of this book Spark many of us into action.<br /><br />I recommend this book, and acting on it. It lost a star for the lack of references and slightly preachy style.erspective and review wouldn't go amiss. There's an element of preaching in the book which is within tolerable limits.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|The Gaga is the most popular dance pop artist in the world. I loved \\"The Fame\\", and \\"The Fame Monster\\" is where it left off! All of the tracks are innovative and creative. Gaga continues to stretch her boundaries as an artist, and proves she can make any genre sound excellent. Gaga is smart for only releasing the new material as a new album, instead of selling just the limited edition. \\"The Fame Monster\\" is locked, loaded and ready for any dance floor! \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"Dance In The Dark\\", and \\"Telephone\\" are the albums best moments. Don't be afraid to give \\"The Fame Monster\\" a try. This album is one monster to not be afraid of!
B001EYGOEM|1.0|I can't decide which has less talent. At the very least Taylor can write a half-way descent song, but that's where her talent ends. her voice is terrible, shrilly, off key, weak and no tone at all. It's amazing how far one can get with the right looks.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I just expected a lot more spunk and range in her first CD...  she's got the voice.   I liked \\"Wild Horses\\", and came to appreciate the softer difference in \\"I Dreamed the Dream\\", but the rest was uninspiring.   I ordered this just because I admire her so much, and really thought it would be fabulous, it's just not.    She can do MUCH BETTER.  Perhaps someone wanted her to be safe, but I think she should take more chances and get rid of the Motown backup singers, her voice can stand alone.

0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol had all the potential to be a book worth printing 5 million copies. I am a big fan of Dan and I jumped at the chance to borrow a friends copy of this book. I started reading it hoping for all the things he has delivered in the last couple Langdon books, unfortunately I found it lacking a bit. Certain scenes served no purpose, through the beginning Langdon seemed kind of pompous as if Dan knew he was successful and through his writing rode on that fame a little. Almost every chapter seems to have a cliff hanger . . . even if the cliff is somewhat small.<br /><br />\\"And then he whispered the secret. . . .\\"<br /><br />~end of chapter~<br />~beginning of new chapter~<br /><br />So and so had no idea what the secret meant ~insert meaningless garble here~.<br /><br />If we are not going to understand the meaning of the \\"whispered secret\\" then why cliff hang? It won't make any sense either way and it will instead irritate us that you made us wait to read nonsense.<br /><br />Another point of aggravation was his constant soap-boxing for the Masons through the beginning of the book. It seemed he was constantly meeting people that didn't like Masons or distrusted them and he felt the need EVERY TIME to defend the Masons as if he were preaching to the readers through the book. I hate an author that preaches at me through his work. Terry Goodkind did it ALL the time and I don't read him any longer.<br /><br />Not sure I am going to read the next book. To me there seemed to be little puzzles in this book. I am close to the end of the book now, and some things that could be interesting are happening, but I am feeling not that compelled to read because I just know that there is going to be some pretty absurd un-realistic things happening and I don't want to get to that point.<br /><br />Not sure what else to say other than his books are starting to be cookie cutter books. Insert dramatic opening, Langdon is arranged to be there somehow, he sees puzzles he is framed (somehow) and then runs from the police through the entire book as he strives to stop some inevitable event that happens within the same day. There is geography, history (which I tend to like in his books even this one), paintings and science. All the same stuff from before. Of course I expected the science and all that, but it is the same structure through the three books. Maybe in the next one, for a change, Langdon won't be a fugitive and will instead work WITH the police instead of following his hero complex.book as he strives to stop some inevitable event that happens within the same day.

B00006C79E|4.0|Finisterre being Saint Etienne's 2002 release showcases a wonderful mix of house, ambient, techno, alternative rock and electronica. The album spawned three singles, i.e., \\"Action\\", \\"Shower Scene\\" and \\"Soft Like Me\\". Allmusic gave the album 3/5 whilst Pitchfork Media gave it 7.5/10. The booklet has no lyrics but does have linernotes written by Mark Perry. 4/5.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is the present and future of guitar expertise; right before your eyes. His performances are endless guitar licks; that captivate anyone that is around a guitar at all. He plays like he wants to teach you something that he has learned. Joe is very entertaining, very good, a great guy, and well worth everyone taking a peek at the future of blues and blues rock. Any Joe Bonamassa is highly recommended.
B000AL5OZK|4.0|Wrap Your Arms Around Me was recorded and produced after her breakup with Abba around 82/83 and is her first post ABBA solo album. The best tracks on this release are \\"The Heat is On\\" and \\"Can't Shake Loose\\". The sound is very similair to what early 80's popmusic sounded like. The photographs also breath an air of the early 80's with big hair and fashion that was typical for that era. Allmusic gave this album 4/5 and I do the same. 4/5.
0790729369|5.0|Hace años estaba buscando esta película pero ya no quedaban en las tiendas de alquiler. Amazon me permitió obtenerla por un costo espectacular y aunque decia que era usada estaba como nueva. La entrega llegó sin problemas. Se las recomiendo.    The Bridges of Madison Country es una película espectacular. Ayuda  a los matrimonios a entender las trampas de caer en la monotonía y descuidar a la pareja. Tambien nos muestra a las mujeres lo importante de tenernos en prioridad aún cuando tengamos hijos y vivir una vida en balance. El amor nos transforma si le abrimos el corazón.
B001EO2UJK|1.0|Frankly, I had no idea what excessive EQ, compression and the so-called 'loudness war, were all about. Thanks (sic) to this set, now I do. Nick Davis, with the approval of the band which is all the more perplexing, has managed to destroy the feel, dynamics and atmosphere of some of the greatest music ever made. While listening to Nursery Cryme, what was a weird tingle, had, by the time Hogweed began, become noticeable discomfort - by the time the album was complete I knew I had to get rid of this set. For those who have given this set glowing reviews I must suggest, without a hint of irony, that you need your ears testing - these things sound like a symphony of flies in a yoghurt pot - have you all become so dulled to dynamics that these really sound like proper music to you - my flabber is ghasted! For those of you considering this as a purchase, you may feel it is worth it for the video material, which, unless you have been part of the bootleg/trading circuit, must seem like the motherlode to you - quite understandably so. But, for the sake of your ears, either stick with your original vinyl or, a decent pre-1990 CD issue - they will trounce the Pinky and Perky version of the music to be found here. Much like another reviewer - 5 stars for the music, 1 star for the 'work' of Nick Davis.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I could not give this album less than 5stars as Susan sings beautifully BUT they have   the background music so prominent that it often drowns out that beautiful voice of hers.  I would like to hear some popular songs. BUT my main complaint is the way Sony recorded it.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Rated R is EXACLY what I wanted fro Rihanna. Its more mature, its dark, its moody, and its great from beginning to end. My first thought was,\\"WOW! Rihanna is thug!\\" She is swearing, talking dirty, and talking about licking a gun after shooting someone. However, its all done with taste; to express her emotions the way a pop star should. It isn't gratuitous, or out of place at all. She is very sad and very angry, and it shows on this Grade A piece of work. Thank you Rihanna and company for letting us in with this album.    Where it shines: Russian Roulette, Wait Your Turn, Cold Case Love, Fire Bomb, Hard.
0307266303|3.0|This is a decent read. If someone was interested in it or in reading more running related topics I would recommend this book, although I would not recommend it to someone just looking for their next book or as a way to bolster interest in running in a 'non-runner'.
B001GCUO16|4.0|I am an avid comic book fan and I make no excuses for the lack of cohesive storytelling. However the fight scenes and special effects were excellent. The acting wasnt oscar calibre but it fit into the action genre the way it needed to.Wolverine was tortured by his past, Sabretooth was ruthless and menacing and Silverfox was the one who did it all for love. The others did a bang up job too. Everyone from Agent Zero to Deadpool played their parts to perfection. Bravo. The content was awesome. The character profile that actually had the character talking as thier characters, nice touch.The deleted scenes needed to be just that. The interview of Lien Wein and Stan Lee was great. It's a nice touch to see the creator of Wolvering get his just desserts. All in all great product fora great low price. Thanks Amazon.
1410403793|5.0|I LIVED this story with my ex- now passed away husband.  Fortunately my children have learned to love their \\"new\\" Dad.  I don't understand the angst of writers who would slam it.  It is LIFE.  Warm, heartfelt and beautiful.  The woman in this book did, in fact, love her husband and children enough to sacrifice her entire life for them.  She did not get to spend time with the man she truly loved and I'm more fortunate than she . . . yet her charactor is supurb; her love no less.  I admire her and do not understand the negative reviews, unless of course those who choose to review negatively also have never experienced the conflicts of life and love.  It is true, it does occur and it is a travisty that we do not acknowledge it.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you're buying Season 3 then I know you've already seen 1 & 2. I don't need to write about how great it is right? Right.      However, what I DON'T love about Season 3 is the way Showtime/CBS set up the DVD! Unlike Season 1 & 2 you CANNOT skip the opening credit/theme song and go directly to the start of the episode. This is highly aggravating. I understand how this could be a small annoyance to some but this really gets under my skin. If you've seen the opening credits once, you don't really need to see them again. Plus I hate that Blood Orange part. Gross. You can fast forward the credits but you cannot chapter skip, if you chapter skip it'll start mid-episode.     Also, the Special Features are lacking. Why no Gag Reel? Why do we have to put the disc in the Computer to access other features?     Dexter is a great show and I will continue to watch it, I'll keep my review at 5 stars but if I had to review Disc Setup and Features, I would give it a 1!
0307269981|5.0|My wife read the first book in Larsson's trilogy and was captivated by it.  She had to have this one, the second.  I have also purchased the third one (The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest) for her from Amazon.co.uk, since it will not be available in the USA until May 2010.  She is almost finished with it, and rates the entire series as among the best writing she has recently read.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is an amazing debut CD and it has tracks that not only showcase Susan Boyle's fantastic voice, but tracks that demonstrate her ability to sing pop, rock, religious, torch, Broadway tunes - all in excellent fashion.  It turned out to be even better than the pre-released 30 second tidbits led me to believe.  I wasn't sure this CD would be one to give to friends and relatives.  But after listening to it one time, I know it will be enjoyed by everyone on my gift list, and not just for the imminent holidays.  If you enjoyed hearing ANY SONG sung by Susan Boyle, buy this CD.  Its quality will surprise you.  I'm a Boyle fan, and it still blew me away.  What a treat!  How often can you say that a much-awaited CD is even a better product that you ever imagined it would be?
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Norah Jones is one of those artists that hardly ever disappoints. I own her first three albums and enjoy them, so when I heard she had a new album coming out, there was no question I'd go and get it. Add The Fall to her string of great releases.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I really don't hear that much of a difference in the sound on here when compared to Norah's previous works. Sure, the bass parts are a little more evident, but they aren't overpowering. And there are plenty of introspective tracks, like \\"Light as a Feather\\", \\"December\\" and especially the two-in-a-row of \\"You've Ruined Me\\" and \\"Back to Manhattan\\". And I challenge any man to step to her after hearing \\"Tell Your Mama\\".<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off half a star is because the canine ode \\"Man of the Hour\\" didn't do anything for me. But the rest of the album is great. I hope The Fall is supposed to refer to the time of the year (rather than an actual descent, as naysayers might want you to believe), but whatever the case, it's damn good. Pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B002HWRYJE|2.0|I enjoyed the movie in the theatre and couldn't wait for it to show up on DVD. I ordered it pre-release so that I would have it the day of release.  I am sorely disappointed in the DVD I received from Amazon.  It will not play on my laptop because the code on the DVD is NOT Region 1 (US and Canada).  It was supposed to be widescreen and it is letterbox to the point of almost being unable to watch because it is so small.  I measured the letterbox on my 37\\" LG HDTV and it was only 10 inches tall!  My friends have purchased the DVD from various local retailers and that is not the case with their versions.  I don't know how to go about returning this product or talking with Amazon about it.  Any suggestions???
B0017R5UAA|4.0|When I found out Fleet Foxes were going to be on Saturday Night Live, I was like, \\"Who the F are Fleet Foxes?\\" Well, I'm sure glad I was introduced to them because there's hardly a bad moment on their self-titled full-length debut.<br /><br />Actually, the way the band releases singles is sort of weird, in that they release songs from this album and their EP, [[ASIN:B0014DBZX8 Sun Giant]], simultaneously (that's why people shouldn't be surprised not to find \\"Mykonos\\" on here). At any rate, while some people might say comparing the band to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young is going a bit too far, I actually think that's pretty accurate of their sound (which is ironic because they were all born in the mid `80s). But this isn't the kind of album you can really take lightly. It...well, look at it sort of the same way you looked at Norah Jones' [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away With Me]]. I'm not saying this is a copy of that album, but in both cases, the casual listener might argue that all the songs are boring and blend into each other.<br /><br />Fortunately, the tracks are easy enough to distinguish from one another after all, which is evidenced by quality songs like \\"Quiet Houses\\", \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" and especially \\"White Winter Hymnal\\". And although I don't know if \\"Oliver James\\" is about a real person or if it's a metaphor, it also shines. In fact, I think reviewer Luann Yetter said it best when she called the band a folk rock choir, and there's nothing wrong with that if you do it right. It's not too late to pick this up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0743298039|5.0|The thirteenth Tale is a brilliantly suspensful, creepy and well written novel ... The story as well as the prose are simply riveting!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I'll admit it: I was introduced to Adele Adkins as one of VH1's You Oughta Know artists but I didn't really pay attention to her until I saw her on that otherwise dismal episode of Saturday Night Live (sure, Sarah Palin helped ratings, but did anyone see that \\"Fart Face\\" sketch???). Anyway, I picked up her album 19 (probably titled as such because that's how old she was when it was recorded) soon after that episode but for some reason I didn't actually listen to the whole thing until recently -- and now I'm wondering why I waited so long.<br /><br />\\"Chasing Pavements\\" is only the tip of the iceberg, folks. On this album you'll find highlight after highlight, like \\"Best for Last\\" and the interesting \\"First Love\\". And although it's very hard to pick a favorite song on here, I'm going to have to go with \\"Melt My Heart to Stone\\"; but the old-school vibe of \\"Right as Rain\\" is a close second. The cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is also great, as is the necessary tribute-to-your-hometown, \\"Hometown Glory\\".<br /><br />In fact, the entire album is great, and it's easy to see why Adele won Grammys with it. No offense, but if you don't have 19 yet, there's something wrong with you, so go pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle's album is wonderful...not spectacular...I downloaded it and have been listening to it for the past couple of hours...the title song, her song from Britain's Got Talent is the standout...as is Cry Me A River...interestingly these are songs she picked for herself before any \\"handlers\\" got a hold of her....and she really delivers...    Daydream Believer was a \\"mistake\\" for her in my opinion.  It is too draggy...needs to be more up tempo...same complaint about a couple other cuts.    I think Susan needs to go back and look and what she likes to sing in the pubs of Scotland and record those, she knows how to pick the right song for herself.  She has a clear, beautiful voice.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Haven't seen this since childhood, many decades ago.  Forgot how delightful this film really is. Recommend it to everyone, whether you have children or not. It will bring out the child in you as you reflect.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|This move was not meant to be any more like the original comic book series than any of the other recent flicks from our child hood days. The movie has a fairly good plot which is a plus as always but the action and special effects were what brought this film alive in a big way. The CGI and true life scenes blended together seamlessly. I also thought it was great that the actresses were not just in the film for eye candy but truly kicked some serious backside! I remember as a kid when reading the comics how the futuristic plots would seem so \\"cool\\" and this film brought that feeling back with the nanomite plot. You can not go wrong by adding this to your Blu-ray collection.
0736063684|5.0|Wonderful strength training book that explains so non athletic folks understands where you run risk of injury, and how to train properly. Excellent graphics!
0756656230|5.0|This is an excellent book for either a young or adult fan of Lego. High quality, sturdy and richly illustrated. Great price too!!
0790729393|5.0|this is the movie adaptation of the novel 'sleepers.'  this book is based on a true story and the film is very true to the book.  robert deniro as the neighborhood priest who would just as soon listen to your confession as bust you in the nose is spot on.  he has the right nuances for the tough guy man of the cloth.  kevin bacon is evil incarnate as the abusive prison guard who beats and molests the 4 friends from the neighborhood.  ron eldard and billy crudup are scary as the grown up boys turned cold blooded killers.  however, in this story you have empathy for what they become based on the horrors they endured as juveniles.  brad pitt and jason patric are wonderful as the two men who didn't completely, well, not obviously, succumb to the horror of what went on in the reform school.  they plot their revenge deliciously.  minnie driver is perfect as the literal, girl next door and dustin hoffman is a fantastic surprise as the washed up lawyer who is defending eldard and crudup.  it's a tough movie to watch, but one realizes this kind of abuse of power has gone on for centuries and ruined lives and families in abundance.  a good movie with interesting twists and turns.  vittorio gassman is also part of the cast as the neighborhood protector.
B00006LHYC|5.0|This CD is awesome from the first song to the last song.  Would highly recommend it.
0743298039|1.0|I read this last year for a book club choice, and it was torture. I will say that I'm not a huge fan of women's gothic novels and I recognize that this one did follow that formula, so if that's your thing, you may enjoy this. That said, I still can appreciate good writing, and there was nothing to appreciate here. This book had all the worn out characters you'd expect in gothic - the strange hermetic heiress, the hostile housekeeper, the zombie-like limo driver, the out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere estate, the writer without focus. I simply cannot share others' views and compare this novel with classic gothic writers, nor would I recommend this to anyone I like...
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown's adventure-prone professor Robert Langdon returns, this time manipulated by (yet another) mysterious, disturbed lone wolf into finding a treasure trove of ancient knowledge, hidden by the Masons somewhere in Washington, D.C.  Discrediting and tearing down the Masons is also part of the villain's plan.<br /><br />Don't expect the level of searing (credible or otherwise) revelation as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and you'll enjoy this fascinating, pulp-inspired thriller just fine.  In fact, I found the book to be entertaining for pretty much the opposite reasons as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\":  The earlier book was a decent page-turner mainly due to its incredible postulations (again, believeable or otherwise) about Christianity and history, with the thriller plot being serviceable at best.  This time, the thriller plot, more skillful and involving than before (though slightly predictable here and there), was the main attraction for me, with the \\"incredible revelations\\" being kind of interesting and fascinating, but nowhere near as earth shattering or memorable as the previous book.  So, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is still a perfectly good book to curl up with, but for somewhat different reasons than the previous Langdon adventure.<br /><br />I also liked the underlying theme of the book, that we should be less worried about a possible afterlife and more awed and fascinated by our species' potential here on Earth.  Of course, the book isn't entirely satisfied with mankind's more obvious areas for growth and improvement- our intellect and capacity to address the world's problems if we really try- but rather suggests that we have some manner of untapped brain power that will ultimately allow us to perform actions approaching the magical.  But this is a thriller, after all, so I guess the inclusion of fantastic material like that is okay... especially when it's in a book that puts forth the laudable view that one can respect and be guided by religion, while not being driven by its every tenet.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", I can't imagine not at least liking a little this latest entry in the series.  It's a perfectly fine installment, and makes me hope it's not another five or six years until we next see Robert Langdon running through some dark, murky corridors in search of an amazing clue to an even more amazing revelation.you enjoyed \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", I can't imagine not at least liking a little this latest entry in the series.

B000WGNLLW|5.0|When you watch the dvd you realize the band was excited to try a new path and revist their club roots. I think the duran fans really let them down when they failed to suport this album. I find it hard to believe true fans wouldn't have found enough songs to make it worth the purchase. Just a symbolic knod to keep tying to make more albums and not make them all the same. This cd wasn't for everyone but compare it to Pop Trash and Liberty and you'll realize even behind the sometimes to much electronics this is a true effort on their part. I love this album because I'm a true pop music and dance fan since the late 70's. I think the Duran base needs to get over Rio and embrace this albumsforward approch, it's fun!I think the band was behind this cd until they recieved the sales numbers. The dvd shows they were having a good time.Later we hear John Taylor saying the band told their backers this style was a bad idea.This album has variety and in a word is cool. Skin divers and nite Runner I guess is just to young for it's rocking chair 40's crowd but I refuse to be so boring.The young crowd may not have embraced this cd but this is not their band. Maybe if they had made a complete dance cd like Madonna made they would have captured this crowd.I think the track Tempted stands up to any Madonna dance tracks. It's amazing! This album is cool to cool for some but Duran fans who failed to suport this cd from the start don't know what their missing.A chance to embrace variety to embrace the style art andcool of Duran Duran.
068815333X|4.0|[SPOILERS] My only criticism of Prayers For Rain was the too-neat ending. I didn't mind that the bad guy we'd been following for the whole story turned out to be under someone else's thumb. What I minded is that that aspect was not fully developed. What was it about the seemingly weak and ineffectual Wesley that allowed him to gain mind-control over Scott and Diane? What was Diane's deal anyway?--money? sex? Same question for Scott. And, what was going to stop Wesley from killing his parents very soon? Fear of Patrick turning him in? With Wesley's proven talent for remaining underground (both figuratively and literally) for years, that fear doesn't really seem reasonable.    Having just written the above, it strikes me that many readers of this so-called genre read SO MUCH, that maybe we're overly picky and very hard to impress. So, I'll end on a very positive note. Dennis Lehane is a very fine writer. Other than his talent for creating a real sense of place--in this case Boston's Back Bay--one thing I admire is his not giving in to the all-too-common cliché of crime/mystery/detective books, movies, etc.: hostility and suspicion between the cops and the private detectives. Generally, PIs are treated by the police as just one step removed from criminals; Lehane's Patrick Kenzie actually has a couple of very good friends on the force and here he is able to develop a working relationship with a cop working on an aspect of his case.
0452289963|5.0|Both my wife and I thought that this was one of the most fabulous books we have ever read.  It has changed the way we look at everything around us.  We just don't realize what a little box our EGOs put us in!  Reading this book will make the serious reader really think about everything in their life and will help them realize that there is another way to live.      One other thought ... my wife likes to READ books - I LISTEN to books - together we were able to share our experience - and grow in our thinking and living together!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|NOT ONE PLACE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT DID AMAZON MENTION THIS WAS EDITED!      SHAME ON AMAZON!    I am 30 years old and I knew to expect the possibility of graphic, suggestive and obscene lyrics.  Why else would I have ordered this CD???  I pre- ordered and paid your da*n 7$ shipping to guarantee that I received it the day it was released... I sat around waiting patiently all day and when it finally came I relished in it like a child at Christmas time.  AND IT WAS EDITED!    SHAME ON YOU AMAZON AND SHAME ON YOU GAGA!  I have purchased EVERYTHING of yours remix ep after remix ep and ALL! What a let down!      Thank goodness Amazon understood and offered a full refund... guess I'll wait for the 'ultra platinum famous monster deluxe schmuck version' to purchase a physical CD... maybe by then I'll get to hear a cuss word or two!!!    BOO AGAIN :(
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Definitely adds a little something. My only complaint is that adding it to your headphone cable makes it all a bit awkward to carry around. I would suggest caution if you use this with a smaller/weaker set of headphones because they can easily blow out.
B002X02V02|5.0|Another amazingly creative masterpice by Lady Gaga!  Too bad it's censored!!!  =(   I specifically searched for the EXPLICIT version, and this album is listed as EXPLICIT. Regardless, every track is still phenomenal!     As with all Lady Gaga's songs and performances, each new track is crafted just as she wants it.  These new tracks are just as you've come to expect from Gaga, loaded with intense electro-retro-glam-pop-deliciousness! I was delighted with every song! And if, like me, you absolutley loved The Fame, let that love affair continue with The Fame Monster!    Amazon has since removed the EXPLICIT listing on this album.
0064410935|5.0|Have you ever loved a pet a lot? Well Wilbur was one loved pet by his owner Fern. Good thing nothing bad happen to Wilbur. He was about to be KILLED! His owner that he got's now wanted him so he got saved YAY! When I read that it got me kinda nervous! The parent's of Fern didn't really want the pet because it was a pig. They only had kept the pig because their daughter wanted it and was crying for it. They were living by a barn which was their uncles. When Wilbur went to that farm he made a friend her name was Charlotte they spent alot of time together they were best friends! If you read this book you will be amazed. When I read the first page I wanted to read more and I  bet you will too!
B002X20W2E|4.0|With all the negative reviews prior to release, I was expecting to be seriously disappointed.  Yes, the album is dark, and rightfully so.  As most artists do, Rihanna pulled her life/experiences into this album, as clearly referenced in, among other songs, \\"Cold Case Love.\\"  During my first listen through, I caught myself rocking out to several tracks like \\"Hard,\\" \\"Rockstar 101,\\" and \\"Rude Boy.\\"  Rihanna still keeps it sexy and even ventures on the edge of 'curiosity' with the rejection filled track \\"Te Amo\\".   If your a Rihanna fan, you'll probally still love a few to several tracks on this one. Buy the whole album and find out which ones you love! I definetly recommend getting the EXPLICIT version, otherwise you'll probably be left with a ton of dubbing. Plus, you won't really be getting the true and full vision Rihanna created with this album.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This album is one of his very best. With a touch of modern and old school. His vocals are to swoon over and every track worth listening to. He takes himself above and beyond.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I am glad I ordered this from this particlar seller,because it arrived in great condition and in perfect time. I ordered it as a gift for someone, and I was afraid I'd have to wait a while to get it. I was suprised to get it a few days after I ordered it! Thanks so much for the purchase!
B0026P3G12|2.0|I couldn't wait until this album came out and when it did, I was truly disappointed.  Susan doesn't seem to have the great voice that I heard on TV.  I probably won't buy any more of her albums.  Chuck
B000YABIQ6|4.0|I have now re-watched Mad Men, Season One, a number of times and my opinion of it has improved, though I still find the lead characters, Don and Betty Draper, to be insufferable.  He's a cad, a liar, a jerk, an egomaniac, totally devoid of humor and not very bright into the bargain.  Betty is an empty-headed, selfish, childish, vindictive bitch, and she's not a very good mother, either.  The actress playing her should be booted from SAG.  She should at least be given elocution lessons and taught how to pronounce contracted words, like 'wouldn't', 'shouldn't' and 'didn't'  which, from her pouting little lips come out, 'wunt' 'shunt' and 'dint'.      Regardless, I am hooked on Mad Men!  Though it is still impossible to believe that Peggy Olson did not know she was pregnant until she gives birth!  Don's history is also a stretch but his secret hillbilly background lays the foundations for some depth in his story.    I have purchased the subsequent seasons (2 & 3) and await Season 4's release on dvd.  I don't have cable or satellite, not just for one show worth watching, so I have to wait with bated breath.  The series got much better after Season 1.    Mad Men is like an evil Dick Van Dyke show.  It's often very funny and the characters, beyond the Draper couple, are well-drawn and complex.  There is some fine acting by Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olson) and Vincent Kartheiser (Peter Campbell).  And I love Joan Holloway played by Christina Hendricks.      Recommended, but the kids probably won't liked it.  It's adult drama and is full (too full) of Don's boring sexual exploits.    I hope they tone that down eventually, it's getting really boring, all that closely-miked lip-smacking and heavy breathing is too adolescent for a show of this quality.

B0011HF6GE|5.0|I LOVE his voice!  It carries me away without even closing my eyes.  I'm so glad Amazon recommended him to me!  He's highly talented and I can see he's already gaining momentum, as he should!
0547258305|3.0|\\"Graceling\\" is pretty great, but it also bothered me. It has great writing, excitement, unique characters and action in its favor. But I found it off-putting that the heroine has been murdering people for her uncle, the king, because her grace (a special superpower some characters in this book are born with) is killing. She's also tortured some of them before killing them. Then, if a female character takes some herbs she can have sex without getting pregnant: I guess birth-control failure or STDs aren't a problem here. There is also a scene that doesn't make sense: A character is left alone with a serious injury for a long time but somehow survives on his own.     I couldn't stop reading this book, but it could be unrealistic or disturbing, too. I think male and female fantasy fans will enjoy it, though they should be in their mid-teens at least.
B001UXJQHE|5.0|His music always seems to fit the mood, some..like his Xmas DVD was rather solemn but the New Years one was hilarious.  His ability to mix the music and bring the audience in with him is one of his great talents.  You feel YOU are part of the concert, not just sitting there.  Even watching the DVD, you still feel that specialness of being THERE.  Living in a smaller town where there is limited music for us to enjoy, this is the perfect answer to getting our senses cleansed.  I have ALL of his DVD's and everyone is different but yet..fit the settings, I would recommend them ALL to all music lovers.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The selections on this album are magical! Susan manages to BE each song she sings, a voice refreshing, innocent and provocative at the same time! She has given the world a marvelous gift this Holiday season with her \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" CD. Wish I could thank her in person for her sacredly sung, prayerful rendition of Silent Night...brings me to tears each time I hear it. It's the most beautiful version I've heard. Think I've played the album 6 times in one day! Thank you, thank you, Susan and all who believed in her and helped her dream come true. The rest of us are richer for it!
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this great new version of the classic tv show and movie series. With some small exceptions to the story line I thought it did a wonderful job of reintroducing all the main characters from the original tv series. The actors were perfect for the rolls they were selected to play and the acting was believable. The special effects were first class and the music super. I look forward to the continuing saga of Kirk, Spock and the gang as they navigate about the galaxy finding new adventure and supplying us, the viewing audience, with excitement, drama and vicarious thrills.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Buble fans won't be disappointed with his new CD. It's wonderful! I bought several for Christmas gifts, and love it so much that I'm having a hard time waiting until Christmas to give them. I listen to it every day, and never get tired of it. My five daughters, ages 17-33, love it just as much as I do, so it's good for all ages. I got a GREAT deal at Amazon.com.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|Out Of The Blue must have been one of these moments in the life of Jeff Lynne and his company when everything just fell in place. This album (and it was over 67 minute long double album when it was released on a record) to me at least, is such an improvement over what had been done by this band prior to 1977 and was something not only they were never able to repeat, but an album which with every consecutive release they were moving further and further away from, in terms of beauty and quality. Out Of The Blue might not be a concept album but it brings on a certain mood and sustains it and it delivers quite a few beautiful songs.<br />I like starting listening to Out Of The Blue sometimes with song no 8 Believe Me Now which is a beautiful short little atmospheric moment introducing Steppin' Out, a very nice mellow song with quite a dramatic John Lennon-ish ending. Following it comes The Concerto For A Rainy Day starting with my beloved Standin' In The Rain, my the most favorite song by ELO. When I listen to this song I understand why they had Orchestra in their name. This song should be a part of everyone's playlist. ELO had 8 musicians in their ranks and we can see why. Big Wheels are following and this is another smooth mellow gorgeous song of a complex structure. So many voices so many sounds and every single one is worth the effort. Summer And Lighting comes next and I hope that you are not bored yet, considering it is 32 years later. This is definitely the weakest song of this Concerto For A Rainy Day. The following Mr. Blue Sky is probably the favorite ELO song for many who used to listen to this music back in those years. It is another great song which probably brings with itself more meaning if you don't happen to live in sunny California. Again, the progression of this song is phenomenal as well. And again, considering we are living in 2009, you might want to download songs 8,9,10,11,12,13 (or skip 12) and listen to a part of this album first and see if you are ready for the whole thing.<br /><br />My favorite songs of Out Of The Blue are Standin' In The Rain, Mr. Blue Sky, Stepping Out, Big Wheels Turning and It's Over. Out Of The Blue is the most important album of Electric Light Orchestra by far and its music is overall great. You may not like everything here, but the majority of it is ambitious and interesting. Listening to these songs mixed with other music might be a really good idea, as it really adds texture to your experience. If you do like this album I would recommend trying the nearest ones earlier and later, but be extremely careful with many later ones. I was hoping to find some jewels on them and ended up listening to them all. No further comments.ready for the whole thing.

0061120081|5.0|Just revisited this gem of a coming-of-age novel after about 20 years, and it's still every bit as striking as it was back then. Scout Finch will always stay as one of my favourite characters of all time as she witnesses the goings-on of Maycomb county where she is growing up in post-Depression America way in the Deep South where prejudice against the blacks was still rampant.    Written almost 40 years ago, the issues of what makes a person human, what courage means, how bigotry and ignorance begets prejudice and becomes a threat to the individual, the family and society, are all still valid issues we're grappling with today.    Narrated through the innocent perspective of a child, the novel is so much more poignant for the unadulterated logic a child possesses and becomes a foil for the folly and terror of man's ways.     Saying any more than this about this timeless classic would only take time away from actually reading the novel. Please read it.
B000000OSW|5.0|What a powerful statement Peter Gabriel released following his marriage break up. Wonderful gift to many considering a divorce so they can hear his pain and then decide to...move on. This experience has the power to make you want to work on what is at hand and not let go and start again only to notice later on that a part of you was gone as well. It is hard to stay whole when parts of you are left all over.<br /><br />Musically this album is complex with big emphasis on drum beat. Peter Gabriel is a phenomenal drummer himself, playing drums and singing for Genesis over 35 years ago. His friends not only from his ethnic music label are joining him here but drums are controlled mostly by them. The Babacar Faye drummers are playing Sabar drums on a couple of songs; Manu Katche plays on most songs; Assane Thiam is playing Talking drum on one song. Besides Tony Levin on bass and David Rhodes on guitar Peter is getting help here from Brian Eno, Sinead O'Connor, Daniel Lanois Ravi Shankar, William Orbid and John Paul Jones amongst others and the instruments include saxophones, trombone, violin, cello, mandolin, harmonica, Mexican flute, Ney flute, Senegalese shakers, and other things. A lot is going on here although the sound is often so full of drum beat that it takes some careful listening to separate some of the instruments. And yes, it is true that the low tones of drums go hand in hand with the dark mood of Peter's spirit. This album is his pain relief.<br />Love To Be Loved holds an incredible moment in it: 'this old familiar craving, I've been here before. This way of behaving, don't know who the hell I'm saying any more. Let it pass let it go let it leave. From the deepest place I grieve this time I believe. And I let go. And I let go. I can let go of it, though it takes all the strength in me, and all the world can see. I'm loosing such a central part of me'... Pretty powerful stuff... This is a very even album. Basically the entire album is great. The only songs I did not care about too much was #4, Steam, which of course got the most air play and attention, and songs #9 and #10. My favorite songs of Peter Gabriel's solo work are the following: Growing Up, Open, San Jacinto, Come Talk To Me, Mercy Street, Low Light, Biko, I Grieve, Running To The Rain, Only Us, Mother Of Violence, Darkness, Couldless, Here Comes The Flood.re about too much was #4, Steam, which of course got the most air play and attention, and songs #9 and #10.

0743298039|3.0|Great writing, disturbing story.  I'm not sure I would read it again.  If you like gothic stories of very odd, nearly mad, people - - then this book will satisfy you.  I prefer to actually 'like' at least some of the characters in a book.  The author is, however, quite talented; that much was obvious from the very first page.  She certainly has the ability to immerse her readers into the world she created.
B0000JCFPE|5.0|I'm a big fan of this movie. I wasn't ever allowed to see it under my parents, but now that they're out of my hair I finally got around to checking this one out. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love learning more about how our culture came to be, and I think this movie showed me some things about my parent generation. I guess I should be rating the delivery and packaging, though, instead of the actual film. I've popped in this version of Basic Instinct twice now and have no complaints to report! But, as long as the original is preserved, I'm pleased, so I guess I'm not a hard customer.    Great movie, regardless, but I can't compare this packaging of it to another.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Although not technically a prequel, but rather an altered timeline, this movie provides a lot of backstory to the original characters, and ties-in to the time after Star Trek Nemesis. Bones and Scotty give the best performances. The special features are amazing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great dvd, there are 3 levels and I alternate between each level depending on how I am feeling that day.  I've been doing this one about 3 months and I still sweat no matter which level I choose to do.  I like this because she incorporates cardio and strength in about 20 minutes and at the end you feel like you got a great workout in.  I alternate between about 6 dvds and this one will definitely stay in my rotation.

B002AGIEYG|5.0|I've just come from hearing Rattle conducting the Berlin Philharmonic live in the First Symphony of Brahms, so while I haven't yet heard this recording I think it's fair to assume the interpretation on disc will be close to what the audience listened to tonight.  It was sublime.   Those who commented that Rattle does not unleash a Karajan tidal wave of sound are correct, but it was not missed.  Instead, we heard what seemed like Brahms' intentions suddenly unveiled-- as chromatically fresh as the Sistine Chapel after its restoration.           Phrasing, too, is presented anew.   One hears echoes of Beethoven, but Wagner, too.   And, I think Rattle even brings out moments that anticipate Mahler.       If the first movement was perhaps less exciting than in some other performances, the second and third were perhaps the most beautiful I've ever heard.   And if the alpine tune in the 4th movement was perhaps more idyllic than titanic, the recapitulation and finale caught harmonic and rhythmic fire in a manner I've never heard before and hope never to forget.   The audience was enraptured.   The ovation was almost as loud as that which followed Dudamel's performance at Disney with his Venezuelan Youth Orchestra.    It was well deserved.  On the stairs leaving the building, members of the audience were hushed yet aglow, sharing glances around at the other ones lucky enough to have heard this.    If the recording is anything like the concert,  it will be worth adding to a collection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|First let me begin by saying I'm not an expert music connoisseur and this is my first CD purchased in several years.    Susan B nailed the songs in this CD.  With her vocals in perfect clarity, accompanied by tier one musicians and singing with heretofore emotion not heard in her earlier renditions ,  the CD is absolutely breathtaking and emotional.  Looking forward to many more from Susan B as she will just get better and better as she is obviously very, very  talented and a very quick study in becoming a truly top tier professional vocalist.  God Bless You Susan B and we wish you all the best!

B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is the way this movie was shot.  It was released in theaters overseas, so the aspect ration was probably 1:6/1.  This is great.  Unfortunately, the sound still is pretty thin.

B002T9H2L0|4.0|Being a fan of previous Tarantino works (mainly Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown), WWII combat films and westerns, I expected to like Basterds a lot more than I did. As you already know from trailers and ads, the film is a lavishly-produced and violent revenge fantasy centered around a plot to take out the Nazi High Command. Basterds has the look of film-making of yesteryear, drawing inspiration and stylistic influences from such sources as the classic 1967 film [[ASIN:B000O176IO The Dirty Dozen]], spaghetti westerns and \\"macaroni combat\\" films (a sub-genre of films produced by Italian directors of the mid-60's). Like all Tarantino films, it is filled with wonderfully inventive, humorous (and sometimes rambling) dialog, quirky narrative pacing, and a cast of memorable characters. And of course, lots of hidden references and punctuated by great music.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the film, there are actually two main story branches: the more publicized one concerning the Basterds, and another revolving around a young Jewish woman named Shoshana who is living in Paris under an assumed name and identity. Her story comes first. In Chapter 1, we are introduced to the film's main antagonist, a charming, highly intelligent, and charismatic SS Colonel named Hans Landa, nicknamed \\"The Jew Hunter\\" for his ruthless efficiency. He visits a French farmhouse where a teenage Shoshana and her family are being hidden. Shoshana is the only survivor of that encounter. She flees, but with a clear opportunity to kill her, Landa lets her escape.<br /><br />Next, we cut to Chapter 2 where we see Lt. Aldo Raine (played by a miscast Brad Pitt) recruiting a unit of Jewish American soldiers to engage in guerrilla operations deep within Axis-controlled France, spreading terror through the Nazi ranks with their ambush tactics and brutality. We see them clubbing Nazi soldiers to death with baseball bats and taking of scalp, shown very graphically. Pitt's performance and mannerisms as a hardened military man from Tennessee (complete with Southern drawl) is not completely convincing, reminding me of his character from 12 Monkeys instead. My major criticism here is with the character development. It's very lacking, in my opinion. We only get a brief vignette/flashback of Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), called out by name in a 60's movie font. We don't get much of a backstory for Aldo or any of the other 7 basterds except Stiglitz, giving us very little emotional investment. Not all of them make it through the film.<br /><br />Next, we have the British coming into play, hatching up \\"Operation Kino\\" (German for \\"cinema\\"), a joint operation with the Basterds to blow up a movie theater where Hitler and his top commanders will be attending a film screening of Joseph Goebbels' newest propaganda film. Mike Meyers makes a cameo appearance as a British General, sounding a bit like Austin Powers with his fake accent. Unknown to the Allies, Shoshana hatches a plot of her own and we return to her in the fifth and final chapter as she sets her plans in motion and the remaining parties converging for a final fateful encounter, all set to David Bowie's bellowing \\"Putting Out Fire\\" (a song originally written for [[ASIN:B000069HZO Cat People]]). It's wonderfully anachronistic and appropriate, as is almost all of the musical choice in the film, which blends rock riffs, Spanish guitar, and too many styles for me to identify.<br /><br />Austrian actor Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant as Landa and is expected to get an Oscar tap for his command performance. Cold, calculating, beguilingly charming, and nuanced, Tarantino says Landa is perhaps his greatest character. Waltz infuses the character with complexity, humor, and wit. He really makes this movie.<br /><br />Stylistically, the film is beautiful shot, visually convincing, and full of that trademark Tarantino flare. It's a very enjoyable experience if you like his work and WWII films in general, but I felt Pitt wasmiscast and not totally believable in his role. The basterds needed more character development if we are to care about their fates. We get very little personality information to go on here, and the film treated them as expendables. Even if the army did, the film shouldn't have treated them as disposables if we are to make a two and a half hour investment in watching this film and in the characters. Overall, I enjoyed this film, but it could've been better.his role. The basterds needed more character development if we are to care about their fates.

B002HEOLH0|5.0|This is a great sophomore effort by Daughtry. His debut album was good in so many ways. This album just adds to the great sound that they already had. I like that he didn't change his sound to try a \\"new\\" sound. He just stuck with what made him popular....great rock! If you even remotely liked the first album, you will really like this one.
B002VLNB1Q|2.0|\\"If you could sit down and have lunch with anybody in the world, who would it be?\\" \\"John Mayer,\\" I replied. \\"Why?,\\" asked the teacher, shocked & surprised at my answer. \\"Because he may not have it all figured out, but it'd be fascinating to see him try.\\" I wasn't being sarcastic in that exchange. In fact, I've taken the many profound monologues he'd give during him promotion of \\"Continuum\\" to heart. His insights on music, on life, and on love. Underneath that Abercrombie exterior is the mind of a modern philosopher. Again, there's no sarcasm here. \\"Continuum\\" is personally one of my favorite albums of all time, since not only is it quite the achievement both lyrically and musically, but it helped me through some hard times in my life. Granted, whatever Battle Studies may be, it sure wasn't going to be this, especially since Mayer tends to switch things up in a whole new direction with every project. I didn't know what to expect. What I should have expected, is the worse.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Heartbreak Warfare<br />Half of My Heart<br />Perfectly Lonely<br /><br />Clearly from the get go, it's clear John was going for a 70s pop inspired sound, as the album highlight's 'Heartbreak Warfare' clearly reminds me of a song that for the life of me I can't remember. Why? Because it all sounds way too familiar. While listening to this album, I was clearly reminded of Sting, both in his Police days, and solo. John Mayer isn't supposed to remind me of Sting. John Mayer is supposed to be better than Sting, goshdarn it! Granted, those who have a particular fondness for this sound will find lots to love about this album, from its sound, to its lyrical content. Personally, I more or less am not a fan. But this album commits a crime worse than its Sting-ness, it's boring.<br /><br />Now granted, it's a rule that all John Mayer singles are not as good as the rest of the album, but \\"Who Says\\" takes the cake, which is quite the feat since pickings on the album are rather slim. The song is essentially \\"Stop This Train\\" with different lyrical content that reminisces about parties, New York City, love, and then somehow fits getting \\"stoned\\" in there. Like much of the rest of the album, it simply does not work, as frustrating as it may be.<br /><br />Overall, nothing about this album is the John Mayer that reached for greatness in Continuum and nearly achieved it. Quite the opposite, since he digressed almost his entire career. No, this is a John Mayer who's guitar playing isn't as great. This is a John Mayer whose songwriting isn't up to par. He may have achieved the goal in his mind, but it's a goal that sucks. Sorry to be harsh, but here's one final blow to the album. John Mayer himself once said 'You can call my albums whatever you want, just don't call it competent. Don't walk the middle line.' Granted that's a heavy paraphrase, but I'm going to use one of the examples he gave in that monologue to describe this album, and it's going to hurt me that it does you, but it's the truth:<br /><br />\\"Battle Studies\\" is dorm room makeout garbage at some of its more mediocre, and what worse is that it's from the 70s.<br /><br />Note: I've let this album sit on me for over a month now, and the only thing that's changed in my opinion is the fact that I liked the song \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" so much that I named it the 10th best song of the year.p This Train\\" with different lyrical content that reminisces about parties, New York City, love, and then somehow fits getting \\"stoned\\" in there.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I still get goosebumps listening to her, even though I've heard her sing I Dreamed a Dream several times on youtube.  Her voice is so powerful and she is a true master at using her God given instrument and talent.  I love Wild Horses, I've had it stuck in my head ever since I heard her sing the song on America's Got Talent.      The songs do seem to be an eclectic bunch, but they all work when you listen to her interpretation of them and remember her story.  Who I Was Born to Be is especially powerful.    When I found out that I could pre-order the cd from Amazon, I jumped on it.  I'm now on my second listen, and I know I'll be listening to it many more times in the coming days.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's long anticipated CD is finally here. All of the tracks were previously recorded by other artists but after my first listen all I can say is \\"WOW\\"! The arrangement of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is different than the one she performed on Britain's Got Talent, but is equally amazing. \\"Wild Horses\\" blew me away and is my favorite track. The CD features an eccelectic blend of music, making it a perfect showcase of Susan's versatility. Many artists perform vocal gymnastics that bastardize the melodies and render their songs virtually unrecognizable. Not Susan! Instead, she keeps the melodies \\"pure\\", allowing her amazing voice to speak (or should I say sing) for itself. Her rendidtion of \\"Silent Night\\" is hauntingly lovely and a perfect ending for the CD. I believe Susan has a great future and I am looking foward to hearing much more from her in the future! Great job, Susan!

B0026P3G12|4.0|For those considering purchasing Susan Boyle's first album, let me give you a few hints.  If you are expecting the exuberance that was evident in her performance on Britain's Got Talent or even America's Got Talent, you are going to be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are looking for some great examples of her clear, strong, and appealing voice, you will find it here.  I badly wanted to be able to give her first cd five stars, but alas I cannot.<br /><br />While the album does have a variety of styles of music, I do not believe that is a benefit for Susan.  Because of the quality of her voice, she does handle everything from the bluesy Cry Me a River to the Christmas classic Silent Night quite proficiently.  But where is her real voice?  What is her defining style?  We really don't know from this album.  I wonder if Susan knows.  Has she become merely the product of professional handlers?  Her initial charm is the diamond in the rough, and while the diamond is still there, the rough unfortunately has disappeared.<br /><br />Now to some specifics.  She has performed Wild Horses and I Dreamed A Dream on various television shows so these are not surprises.  Again, I prefer the raw if imperfect power of Dream evident in her first performance on Britain's Got Talent that received so many UTube hits, but the recording is poignant and worthy of her signature song.  I am not a big fan of cabaret blues, so I will pass over Cry Me A River, although she certainly shows that she can sing that kind of music.  As much as I like both Susan and How Great Thou Art, this particular performance does not work well.  The back up choir ends up drowning out Susan in the last chorus, and I would have preferred a vigorous performance from her rather than the subdued approach she has chosen.  This is, after all, meant to be a BIG song.<br /><br />Not sure what to make of You'll See.  I was not familiar with this song as I was with many of the others.  It builds to a climax with a great orchestral flourish at the end, but as with the choir on How Great Thou Art I am not sure the orchestra serves her well.  Her interpretation of Daydream Believer surprised me, again because of its understated and subdued approach.  Any resemblance to the hit by the Monkees is gone, but in this case I actually think it works, partly because of the simple piano accompaniment.  Instead of getting louder and louder it actually gets softer and softer as it progresses.  Up to the Mountain is another attempt to show her versatility with a gospel-sounding choir as backup.  She does let loose towards the end, which is the main reason I like it.  Amazing Grace is a risky choice because we hear it so much, especially at funerals.  This is another case where the back up choir takes over in the middle of the song, and I am sorry because I bought the album to hear her sing.  As with Daydream Believer, it seems to just fade away at the end.<br /><br />Who Was I Born To Be fits the album well.  The title portrays her lack of self-definition, evident throughout the album.  Is she a frumpy working class girl from a small town in Scotland, or a polished professional singer?  Is she an exuberant singer of Broadway shows tunes or a soft cabaret musician?  In this case the background orchestral production serves to highlight her singing rather than take away from it, and it ends up being one of the strongest tracks.  I enjoy Proud just to hear her voice, but it feels like filler.<br /><br />I am old enough to remember Skeeter Davis singing the End of the World, with its early 1960s country flavored kind of innocence. Susan tones it down several notches, but thankfully some of her natural passion does show through.  What can I say about Silent Night?  The clarity of her voice fits the Christmas classic well.  This is one place where the soft approach not only works, it is a necessity.  I do have to ask why end her first cd with Silent Night?  It is near Christmas, but how will it feelthe rest of the year?  Time will tell.<br /><br />In the end if you like Susan Boyle's singing, this is a must have because it's your only choice.  Along with other reviewers, I hope that future releases will allow her to truly break out and flourish, as well as to find a style that is uniquely hers.ell.

0385504225|5.0|As I was reading other reviews for this book I was shocked. I will not use big words to describe why I think this book is amazing I will only offer my humble opinion. In a world filled with bad reviews a good review is needed. Dan Brown's books are refreshing in that while they can get rather lengthy they grab you from page one and keep you wanting more. Yes he uses a lot of descriptive language but for me this only allows me to better picture in my mind the plot and setting. Also, Dan Brown sticks to what he knows works he uses a recurring character, Robert Langdon, gives Langdon a symbol related problem that takes him all over particular cities, pairs him with a female sidekick, and offers an offhand twist to something based in religion. To me Brown's fast paced books are extraodinary in that he really challenges you to think about things in a different light. Personally I find his logic hard not to believe. At the end of the day I consider what his logic has handed me and I wonder \\"what would the world be like if this were true?\\". All I can say is if you are bored with Brown's repetitive style quit picking up his books. I for one hope there will be another Langdon novel because I believe there is much more for him to learn.

0756656230|5.0|I just gave it to him for his birthday today and I achieved my goal which was to buy him a gift he would love. He is glued to this book and enjoying it immensely (to say the least). All kidding aside my only regret is that I gave him the book when I first saw him. I drive two hours to visit him and as we went about our activites he lugged that heavy book everywhere and had his nose poked into it at every lull in activity! Needless to say I did not get his full attention that day but he was in \\"Lego\\" heaven. This book is light years better than a catalog, there is no comparision. As an educator, I can see that it also is helping with my nephews reading. There are wonderful pictures, however there is also plenty of text. The balance of text and photos is perfect. I cannot say enough about this book. It was definitely worth the money. I will be buying  more Lego books from this publisher.
B002XUL85G|5.0|I first read about Paranormal Activity from Fangoria a few years back and then it disappeared off the radar for a while. Once I learned it was finally coming out, I had to see it; I went with a group of friends and we all agreed that this was the scariest horror movie we'd ever seen.  This movie will truly have you looking over your shoulder for a while after seeing it- every little noise will make you wonder \\"what's that.\\" If you're in for a good scare you'll love this film. It's truly worth a watch.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is going to Japan, and his family and friends are having a going away party for him. Hud (T. J. Miller) has been tasked with filming the whole thing so they can remember it.<br /><br />But before too long, the ground shakes. At first, they think it is an earthquake. In New York? Before long, they realize that something horrid is happening in Manhattan. Can they get off the island alive?<br /><br />The film is supposed to be a documentary as filmed entirely by Hud. As a result, we get one camera. And it is a very shaky camera at that. This was part of my problem with the film. I actually got motion sick in the theater and had to leave about three quarters of the way into it. It's probably much better on home video than on the big screen, but I don't care to try again.<br /><br />See, I didn't like any of the characters.  All of them were self absorbed and irritating.  Heck, I wanted the monster to win so the movie would be over.  Not that this is the actors' fault.  They were great as these spoiled kids.  Sorry, I meant adults.<br /><br />I do have to give the special effects credit.  They were good.<br /><br />And the story was completely predictable.  I guessed how it ended correctly based on what I saw.<br /><br />This movie is a complete waste of time.  Skip it and watch something truly entertaining.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|When I first heard of Lady GaGa, I wasn't too sure I liked her.  Her first CD, The Fame, was good, but I didn't LOVE it.  Don't get me wrong, there are still the hits that I definitely loved, but as a whole CD, it wasn't great.  I heard Bad Romance for the first time on the radio and absolutely fell in love with it.  And, later, after listening to Monster, I decided to give the CD a chance, and I'm so glad I did!  From start to finish, this CD is fast-paced with awesome beats.  Perfect party music.  My favorites on the CD are Bad Romance, Monster, Telephone (which is just ridiculously amazing, with Beyonce!), and Alejandro, although I love them all.  The only song that I don't just LOVE is Speechless.<br /><br />  If you're a fan of Lady GaGa's fast-paced songs, then you will love this album!!  I recommend this to anyone who likes songs with a good beat.  GaGa's songs are amazing, but are different than that mainstream pop.  Just take a listen for yourself!

B000024D4R|5.0|There's no denying this album's longevity. You've seen it on countless best-of decades lists. It's a mainstay on critic's favorite lists. In short, there comes a point where the hype dies and people arrive at a consensus.    My favorite thing about Animals is how atypical of an album it is. The two short Pigs on the Wing songs bookend the album, serving dual role as both the friendly greeting and goodbye. The real meat of the album (dogs, pigs, sheep) last nearly a combined 40 minutes. One would think these songs may drag on repeat listens. This is not the case. No small feat for just three songs... all three are completely brilliant in their own unique way. As far as classic albums go, this one is a top 5 favorite for me.
B000FZETKC|5.0|John Hughes proves he still had the right stuff to make a superb movie about teenagers with 1987's \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\".  Eric Stolz stars as Keith, a sensitive artistic kid from the wrong side of the tracks, who works after school as an auto mechanic and who has a monumental crush on pretty and popular classmate Amanda (Lea Thompson).  Mary Stuart Masterson is pitch perfect as tough tom boy Watts, Keith's best friend.<br /><br />Keith decides to ask Amanda out, a daring act which cuts against the grain of his social standing, the advice of the horrified Watts, and the warning of Amanda's angry former boyfriend Hardy (Craig Sheffer).  The rest of the movie is the gutsy Keith's preparation for his date with destiny (and Amanda).  Watts helps out, if only to save the dreamy Keith from himself.  Keith will also get an unexpected assist from a tough kid he befriends in detention.<br /><br />Hughes and Director Howard Deutch have the sensitive touch to portray three-dimensional young people with real hopes and fears, without drowning the audience in schmaltz.  The conclusion of the movie manages to be dramatic, insightful,and romantic all at the same time.  \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" is still all that, and very highly recommended to fans of John Hughes' other movies, such as \\"The Breakfast Club\\".
B0026FCNK2|5.0|One of the great modern cinematic classics, 12 Monkeys looks beautiful and gracious on BluRay, It is very nice to see a film such as this get the treatment it deserves. Cheers!
B002JIOQCO|4.0|Andrew Stockdale had the proverbial \\"artistic differences\\" with his old Wolfmother mates, so after the international success of the debut [[ASIN:B000EJ9MTW Wolfmother]] CD, he picks up a new bassist and drummer...and then makes an album that sounds almost exactly like the first. if you revelled in the 70's thud and crunch of that one, you're going to be in Van Heaven when you get hold of \\"Cosmic Egg.\\"<br /><br />The influences are all still there, be they the Zepplin stuttering of \\"White Feather\\" or the [[ASIN:B00004SWDU Deep Purple]] organ that wells up from \\"In The Castle.\\" And like before, you get the feeling Jack White/[[ASIN:B0015KO52S The Raconteurs]] have been in the boys' CD players. \\"Cosmic Egg\\" is a big guitar album, filled with dirty riffs, down-tuned chording and wah-wah racket (love that bent sound on \\"Pilgrim\\").<br /><br />Even the cover art and album title harken back to a hazier day. The lyrics occasionally slip into hippie-mysticism (\\"California Queen\\") and Hendrixian Guitar Utopias (the six minute \\"Violence Of The Sun\\"), but Wolfmother never fall into boredom. \\"Cosmic Egg\\" will make you hope they stay on this track and wonder if the next album cover will be a Frazetta painting.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|I loved the selection of songs and the concept of the album.  But most of the music seemed out of Sting's natural register, so it sounded strained and uneven throughout.  It's a shame, because it could have been brilliant.
1573300403|5.0|this is a great cd, it includes well known ones such as beat it, billie jean and of course thriller, but also many little known ones, i esp like \\" they dont care about us \\".  if u are a fan, u will like this cd, that boy can dance!!
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I too (like so many others before me) am a devoted John Mayer fan. I thought \\"Room for Squares\\" was one of the best pop albums ever recorded, enjoyed \\"Heavier Things\\" and was exicted when \\"Continuum\\" signaled John's coming of age and maturation as a song writer and serious guitar player.     So with baited breath and anticipation I tore open the Battle Studies CD package and listened, and listened, and listened............    The voice and quality of production are still there, but the songs on Battle Studies don't grab me. I mean there are a couple of tunes that I like, but most are not up to his usual song writing genuis. It's like these songs could have been out takes that didn't make it onto \\"Heavier Things\\".     As selfish as it is, I wanted John to continue on toward a more rock/blues based platform, but John (or his handlers) decided to retreat back into Mediocre Pop Land. Like many, I will definitely buy his next effort, but am somewhat disappointed with this one.

0385474547|5.0|I've taught this book four different times in the classroom to 9th graders. It's the one book that I can safely say keeps the kids interested, especially the boys.  Come on! When it comes down to it, what do young adults want to learn? It doesn't matter; they just don't want to be bored. In \\"Things Fall Apart\\" there's violence and a lot of action, never a dull moment.  Teenagers love it, and by the end of the book, they've learned so much about the Nigerian colonization and the destructive path the Europeans burned right through their culture. Lot's of debate will ensue regarding Morals vs. Culture. What is right? What has the right? Tons of cross-curricular potential.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I had been looking forward to the release of this CD since seeing Susan on BGT.  But after purchasing it yesterday, and listening to it last night, I have to say I was disappointed. Firstly, the arrangement of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is not the one the Susan sang when she auditioned. WHY couldn't they have left it alone?  Secondly, there weren't any up beat songs on the CD.
0060254920|2.0|I thought this book was going to go a lot deeper than it actually did. As I was reading it, I couldn't believe a movie was made based on this particular book. I don't see any redeeming values in the boy. He's just a boy that really doesn't learn or change his ways. I want children's books to have a moral, to teach my child about the good things in the world. This book falls flat in doing that.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I, like millions, saw the Youtube clip of Susan Boyle's debut to the world on Britain's Got Talent. I'm ashamed to confess that I, also like millions of others, wondered who is this plain looking woman?  When she opened her mouth and belted \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\", I was left in tears. Susan Boyle's meteoric rise to fame serves as a reminder to all of us who find it so easy to judge a book by its cover. Thanks to Susan, I now know that beauty comes in all forms. As for her new album, I think the performances are stunning. I'm sure there are those who ponder her choice of songs, however, as the Amazon review points out, she selected songs that resonated with her on an emotional and spiritual level.  For those who wanted more Sondheim, Lerner and Lowe, etc. - just wait, I'm sure there's more to come! This incredibly talented woman will be around for a long time!
B002VLNB1Q|3.0|First let me say that I am a huge John Mayer fan mainly because of his guitar playing and the craftsmenship of his songs.  I am mainly a blues guitar fan.  I buy a lot of Clapton and BBking and solid blues guitar albums. In the past, John seemed to have blended blues guitar with well crafted pop songs.  Unfortunately, this album is no comparison to Continuum.  The songs are well written and John's voice sounds great.  But none of the songs are memorable.  None of the songs have any outstanding guitar riffs or playing.  Gone are the blues elements that really add to John's songs.  I listen to Continuum over and over again and I never get sick of it.  I listen to his first two albums as well but I think Continuum is by far his best.  The John Mayer Trio Try! album also smokes.  Maybe the songs on Battlestudies will grow on me but so far I'm very bored.  They seem like love and sorrow overintellectualized.  On a good note, John's expression of his voice continues to grow.  I'm sure once he plugs his Stratocaster in for these songs in his live shows, they will sound much better.  He'll be around for a long time.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|The album is fantastic. I ordered the deluxe edition on Amazon and bought the standard version at Wal-Mart (since it was only 8.00) and considering I bought The Fame at Wal-Mart and it was NOT censored, I assumed the same with The Fame Monster, I was wrong! It is censored, so it's not just Amazon. I googled \\"the fame monster censored\\" and apparently a lot of people are having the same problem--regardless of where they purchase the CD. Censorship is ridiculous!

B0026P3G12|3.0|I really love Susan Boyle.  I also enjoyed this album and have already listened to it multiple times.  Although her voice sounds wonderful, I feel as though it was restrained.  The thing I love the most about Susan Boyle's voice was that it was so powerful.  I enjoyed many songs on this album, but it is best to listen to it when you want to hear something calm and relaxing.  I feel like a couple of songs could have been added with a more upbeat tempo because the whole album is pretty slow.  Great start Susan!  Don't let them hold you back!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|The reason I ordered this movie is because I absolutely love it and wanted to have my own copy to watch whenever I wanted.  I especially like the low pricing of movies on Amazon.

B002OT732I|5.0|The album is fairly good.  Several of the songs are quieter and more melodic than say Herzeleid or Sehnsucht.  However about half of the songs are good solid hard grind industrial.  I liked it when i first heard it, but then it just continued to grow.
B0028K31CE|3.0|Oh my!  I have been waiting for years for Maxell to return and I am so very happy that he has.  Now as far as this CD, I have to admit, I was not impressed.  I felt it lacked his typical \\"luster\\" and \\"passion\\".  I wrote it off to him getting back into the \\"biz\\" again and being a little rusty or maybe new writers or writer's block.  I can ONLY hope that his next CD will be like his older music...Please bring back the \\"soulful\\" Maxwell and I hope we don't have to wait as long as we did for this one!  We miss you!

0316017922|5.0|Sure, Gladwell picks his studies and anecdotes to prove his points.  It's not fair to say his information is unsupported, he does cite plenty of research to support his theories.  Anyone can be a cynic and claim that he is biased or that he is fake and catchy.  The real point is, it's inspiring.  Gladwell understands that the world in a world of possiblity.  Thinking about things differently is usefull, and finding a unique perspective is valuable.  I think it's a good estimate of the truth.  I think it helps understand reality, but more importantly, I feel better about myself and my potential in the world.   We are humans, we live in our heads and our hearts, and Gladwell explores what it means to be human, with the limitations and possibilities.
B002X063OC|4.0|If you liked Lady Gaga's first album, you'll like this one too. It has a similarly warped postmodern sensibility. It's a well-crafted, slightly bizarre dance-pop album with electroclash and european dance-pop influences. This time, it has more of an R&B and Madonna influence, too. The vocals are clean a bit more often, so Gaga can show off her voice even more.     While that's welcome, unfortunately on the whole, the album's a bit more uneven owing largely to the poppier direction versus the more consistent europop/dance-oriented nature of Fame. This is owing primarily to the introduction of boyband and pop R&B producers like Garibay, Fair, Daniels, Jenkins & Riley. It leaves the album feeling disjointed and significantly less subversive than the last album, which threatens to swallow up the things that make Gaga so interesting. It turns out she may just be another pop star, rather than the outrageous glam parody of one from Fame.    The first 3 songs - Bad Romance, Alejandro and Monster are absolutely amazing (and none-too-shockingly, produced by RedOne) and sound like a continuation of the style on Fame but with more R&B elements (Alejandro has some Ace of Base and world music influences, too). They're also the best songs on the album. No, they're really, really good. After that, the album is mostly downhill. Still, downhill for Gaga really isn't that bad - it just mostly sounds kind of like Aguilera off of Stripped. But, oh God, are the first three songs good. Bad Romance alone is probably one of the best pop songs of the last 5 years.     The only clunker on the thing is the sure to be successful \\"telephone\\" a generic Daniels/Jenkins produced R&B number about being \\"in the Club\\" featuring Beyonce. It lacks the kind of originality that made GaGa interesting on the Fame.    Highly recommended for the fans of the last album, and fans of dance, pop, and the theater and LGBT crowd. One major caveat though. The lyrics are censored, which I find a bit disturbing.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|While searching for the 80's miniseries with Patrick Swayze about the Civil War, I discovered this N&S from the library.  After spending an entire rainy Saturday watching it while doing laundry, I got online  to purchase my very own copy.  Something I rarely do. I loved the story, history of the industrial revolution, the secondary characters and storylines and, of course, the sexual tension between the two leads.  I haven't enjoyed a movie so much since Lost in Austen.  Any fan of Pride & Prejudice would love this DVD.  I lent it to my sister-in-law thinking she, too, would love it and she ended up ordering a copy for herself.  For the record, I am an intelligent, happily married, gainfully employed 40-something woman and not some moony teenager.  But OMG, that Richard Armitage can do \\"sexy scowl\\" like nobody's business!
B002NPUCP8|5.0|Ok, yes this is basically a pop album, albeit one that rocks. A few reviewers seem to have a problem with that. The thing about Orianthi's pop is that just underneath is some real scorching guitar work. It's been noted that she should have released a guitar instrumental or a harder album. For right now I think she did exactly the right thing for her career. She wants to be heard and also be known as a guitarist. I think if she would have realeased just an instrumental album, she wouldn't have been able to reach a very wide audience. She's got the chops to do anything she wants, but first she's got to get the audience, and I think this root will do that. Everyone forgets that Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, even Eddie Van Halen have put out a lot of \\"pop\\" songs. It gets you heard.     The thing I like is that an Album like this one can bring good guitar back into the mainstream. So what if it's being done by a 24 year old Aussie girl, who likes a great pop hook. To me it's her playing that matters. and man, can she play. Yeah the songs are a bit reminiscent of other current girl pop rock, but the huge difference is her guitar work is front and center, even with the pop veneer. Give it a listen, and think about where a talent like Orianthi's  is going to go. This album will get her noticed and who knows what's next.

B002SYXCVK|3.0|Sting has an incredible flavor to all of his works. This is pretty much a follow up album to Songs from the labyrinth.  What I love about Sting is he's not afraid to try something new.  This is more simple madrigal music.  I listened to it a couple of times and enjoyed it, but compared to his other albums which have been different and interesting I thought this was pretty bland.  Not a bad album, but not up to my expectations.

B001EO748M|5.0|\\"The Tudors-Season 2\\" continues with more wonderful production values, top-notch acting (most notably Jonathan Ryes Meyers who plays the King), and intelligent writing. This season focuses on King Henry VIII's break from the Roman Catholic Church and his creation of the Church of England due to the former's refusal in granting him a divorce from Katherine of Aragon. The King still has the desire to have a male heir for his Monarchy and it is his hope that his new love, Anne, will grant him his wish. Eventually, Anne is unable to give Henry what he wants and she becomes a mere memory in the King's line of sexual conquests. This season, like season one, features ten episodes. The only bonuses are select commentary on individual shows. The episodes themselves are presented in flawless widescreen. Four full seasons of \\"The Tudors\\" will be produced after the series halts production. Season three is scheduled for a DVD release in early 2010 and the fourth and final season should be availble in early 2011 after its original Showtime airing.
B00005R8FI|4.0|If you are a fan of the Mark-Almond band, if you are interested in hearing some great drumless (unplugged!) music by a crack group of session/ road/ legendary performers, this is it. John Mayall albums are generally blues-harp-guitar fests, but this is something really special. To my ears, this is the best Mayall album overall. And his audience loves that chooga-chooga

B002KDUDG6|4.0|Wonderful Michael Buble stuff.  He seems to be growing into his persona.  As usual, band backing up is fantastic!
B002R68U7K|5.0|This collection is amazing. I was so happy to receive this package in the mail....I was totally surprised how beautiful it was and how amazing the quality of the songs and videos were. The pictures are amazing. Jive/Britney did a great job with the info and design on this package/cds. Any real BRITNEY SPEARS fan would buy this. It is surely a collectors things. I love Britney and got 2. I love the songs and the unreleased tracks. What i LOVE so much our the Remixes of great songs like \\"RADAR\\", \\"3\\", \\"Born to Make You Happy\\", etc  I love this cd.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I did not expect to like this album upon first listen, but damn if the songs don't grow on you. I love \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" and \\"All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye.\\"    I think John took a lesson from the Tom Petty School of pop rock: Keep it simple and heartfelt. Strip it down to its element and just let the music be.     My only disappointment is that John didn't take a lot of time with creating his usual batch of clever and thought-proviking lyrics that make his talent stand out above the crowd.
B002UXRH10|5.0|These songs are amazing. She honestly blew me away with these songs...didn't expect it from this album to be honest. it is worth every penny...I love 'HARD', 'COLD CASE LOVE', 'RUSSIAN ROULETTE', 'TE AMO', \\"WAIT YOUR TURN\\" and many others. truly amazing and A+ album for sure.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This is not my favorite Muse album; but it rises far above the pap that permeates the airways at present. I'll keep this brief. There are blatant references to things from the past. That's how music works, for the most part; Excepting the Avante Garde. This is a solid work, in my opinion. No one can deny J.Bellamy's incredible voice and talent on guitar, keys, and songwriting in general.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|This cd is so bad...the album The Fame is okay but the new songs suck. They are not the same Gaga. I love her first singles but this is crap and waste of money. Sorry.
0061655546|5.0|I loved this book, especially the first half where the author focused on the rise and the personality of Ross Johnson, and the rise of KKR.<br /><br />Yes, the middle of the book it got bogged down with many details and characters; so for a while I had a hard time following everything, but then it all sank in.<br /><br />I suppose the author could have left out some material. That would have made the book an easier read, but I wanted to learn as much as possible about what went down, so In the end I'm grateful for all the detail, and for an in-depth view into a world I knew so little about.<br /><br />Randy

0758232225|3.0|I love Mrs. Griggs and have purchased and read all her novels leading up to this one, but this particular story was a bit rushed at the end.  For instance, the ex-wife was in the kitchen preparing a meal for him and their daughter she came over (main character) and in a mad dash to keep her from leaving, he proposed to her, all on 1 page.  There was no thought to it at all and the story ended right there.  I just felt cheated.  I detest stories that take the time to develop the characters and when you get to the end, they rush to bring everything to a head.  How fair is that to the reader?<br /><br />And I believe that some of the storyline was off.  In Strongholds, which was written before this one, Angel was pregnant and found out her husband had pornographic desires that she was not aware of.  In this book, they've just returned from their honeymoon but the book made several references to the fictional Pastor's series on Strongholds that he taught.  In fact, the main character in this book had gotten over her married lover in the book Strongholds and this was her new relationship.  So how could they have been returning from a honeymoon in Practicing when in Strongholds she was \\"very\\" pregnant.  Confusing indeed.
B002T45VX6|2.0|When the release date changed, from Oct to nov 23rd, and the song list was 10 songs, and in rolling stones mag she said she wrote 60 songs for this cd, and in the first draft she could only come up with 10? and the 10 are not so great, so they pushed back the release date to nov 23, and they added versions of the same songs with rap, I dont think its gonna help, its weak, the only good songs, are,the rock mon amour one of the best songs, she wolf, spy, its like shakira has lost her edge? and she has, droping her music skills to make pop top 10 music. I will tell you now, I dont see too many top 5 or number 1 song on this cd. I guess time will tell. Like i said, there were many problems from the get go. its a mixed bag, I love shakira, maybe she will do what she doses best, and not worry about top 10 hits, and give her fans what they love, Shakira, untamed, loose, wild, kinda like a SHE woof. awwoooooo.
044654146X|5.0|This book showed me another side to the whole middle east story. It's not just wars and terrorism. There are vibrant, creative, and entrepreneurial activities going on that more people should be aware of.  Also, a great read for anyone thinking about creating a new business.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|What can i say about ga ga? she has passed madonna and brit, The fame monster, is great, the only song, speechless, which is put in the wrong spot, kinda brings the cd to a stop, should have been the last track, but other than that, songs like Monster, Dance in the dark, Telephone, Teeth, and the 1 single on i tunes, bad romance, you cant go wrong, ga-ga has so much to give, sorry, but she has passed brit, and madonna  as the new queen of pop. I thing Lady gaga is gonna be around for a long, long time. I AM GAGA FOR GAGA.

B0025KVLSI|4.0|These remasters sound much better than the previous editions.   But the discs come in Eco-wallet cases, not Digipacks.   This means that you don't keep the disc in a plastic tray,   instead, you slide it into the Eco-wallet sleeve.  The difference is that in Digipacks, the surface of the disc is NOT in contact with the plastic, preventing it from scratches, while in Eco-wallets the whole surface of the disc (both sides) comes into contact with the sleeves.  Has anyone seen signs of wear beacause of this on his discs?
B002XUL85G|1.0|The only great thing about this film was the marketing. The review saying it's the scariest film ever scene was a joke. After seeing the film, it did not live up to 2% of the hype. Instead of being suspenseful, it dragged. 5 minutes of the film were entertaining and thats about it. Don't waste your money. Go rent The Exorcist instead if you want to see a real horror movie.
B000AYELVU|5.0|I have been a fan of the X-Men ever since I first started the X-Men cartoon series back in the 1990s.  This movie, as its name implies, is a sequel to the first X-Men movie.  In this movie, the X-Men have to rescue their leader, Professor Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart, from evil government forces.  Along the way, Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, discovers clues that could lead him to his lost memories.  The action scenes kept me engrossed in the movie and I found the plot very interesting.  I recommend this DVD to any X-Men fan.

0071636080|4.0|Are you a salesman who likes to pitch a \\"story\\" about your company in the first five minutes of meeting a new prospect?  Have you ever been annoyed when the \\"product marketing geek\\" hands you back your PowerPoint with about 20 extra \\"bullet points\\"?  Have you ever felt crestfallen when the VP of Sales hands you a 35-page PowerPoint on the way into your sales meeting and asks you to deliver it in 20 minutes?  Have you ever cringed when one of your colleagues reads the slides on the screen and turns her back to the audience, in order to see the words better?  Have you ever fallen asleep during a presentation conducted in the dark of night required for a projector to work?  Have you ever felt physically ill at the prospect of being invited to watch someone else's PowerPoint?<br /><br />If you have answered, \\"Yes\\", to any of these questions, then this book is for you.  This book vindicates your feeling that there is a better way to conduct sales meetings, to craft PowerPoint presentations, and to use the technology towards the purpose for which it was designed.  Granted, this is not the only book that makes this claim - and it does seem that there is a cottage industry among \\"communications consultants\\" who have written similar books - but this is clearly the best one I've read.<br /><br />And, this is for two reasons I think: First, Gallo focuses on one person's presentation style - Steve Jobs - on whom we can all agree that he is a master of this game.  And,  second, Gallo has done the hard work of identifying and outlining what makes Jobs' presentations really work.  Jobs creates a storyline, treats the presentation as theater, and enacts it as performance.<br /><br />With Gallo as a guide - and his suggestion that we all study Jobs's presentations available on YouTube - we are encouraged to have the courage to give better presentations and to stand up to our colleagues and superiors who insist on giving the same old boring PowerPoint presentation, because \\"it is what it is.\\"<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't give this book a 5-star rating is that Gallo suggests that we, like Jobs, create drama in our presentations by offering a foil or enemy, like Jobs does with Microsoft.  I have always felt that this was hokey and unnecessary, and although I'm a Mac enthusiast, I wish Apple would stop doing this.  If you can get past this minor criticism, you will rate this a 5-star book for yourself.t it is.\\"<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't give this book a 5-star rating is that Gallo suggests that we, like Jobs, create drama in our presentations by offering a foil or enemy, like Jobs does with Microsoft.

B002T45VX6|3.0|Let's face it, if you are still longing for another Piez Descalzos or Donde estan los ladrones?, give it up, that Shakira is long gone. The Shakira we have now is a pop singer who have been crawling up the charts slowly but consistent, but who still has many flaws that could end up banishing her career. She wolf is clearly an effort to succeed in the mainstream pop world, a record designed  to contend with the Brittney Spears of the world, but as any other calculated product, the flaws are bared and evidently visible. First is that stubborn tendency to imitate Beyonce; even though is true that Shakira has never been the most original artist (in the past she has drawn from Alanis Morissette and No Doubt), she is setting her foot in dangerous ground. Shakira lacks the strong stage presence that take even the most dull Beyonce's song to a higher level (listen to \\"Single Ladies\\" and then watch the video and tell me if you listen to the song the same way), but what Shakira lacked in stage presence she made up with her injection of intellectualism in her lyrics and musicianship, but in She Wolf, even that is very hard to find. Still, she managed to integrate some gems in the album. \\"Did it again\\" hit all the right notes and melodies, and for a moment there, Shakira's voice reminded me of that rebel girl with the pink highlights that she once was. \\"She wolf\\" is a really good club song a la Daft Punk, and \\"Gipsy\\" is vintage Shakira, the classic mix of Arabic sounds and instrumentation that always makes her shine. Things start to go down by the end of the record and the flaws come crawling back materialized by Kid Cudi and Flo Rida cameos. Shakira is more efficient when she pairs with singers that resemble her music panorama (remember Alejandro Sanz?), but hip hop is a big no no for her. Even Wyclef works since he seems to get the most out of Shakira's Latino roots. In the end one have to wonder if Shakira really believes that she is winning new fans by abandoning what makesher stand out, while I argue that her fans today were the same singing \\"Ciega sordomuda\\" at the top of their lungs. I only hope that by trying to become the next Madonna she doesn't end up as Kylie Minogue.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|Let me start off by telling you my own view on some feelings/comments this film has drawn from other viewers: I don't think Laugier's Martyrs is anywhere near as pholosophical and thought provoking as Irreversible (to give an example). It's beautifully shot and intense, but there's nothing to really think about here. The thing many viewer's note about the plot is that it deals with existence itself -or the moment where it runs away from you. But it never really goes deeper into the subject, which is fascinating by itself. We get a lot of nightmare-inducing beautifully shot sequences which make up for a brilliant experience. This is not a movie, it's a thrill-ride into some places not everybody is ready to dwell into.<br />Now, onto the film itself. Here you have one of the most intense and explosive experiences in terror. It is not Eli Roth's crap or Saw or Haute Tension. This is something else. This is a road where everything is thorn-covered and those thorns turn thicker with each extra minute. You will not get any pleasure from it as you do with regular slasher fare. This is the equivalent of a cinematic nightmare and it delivers some impressive images. Yeah, I've seen gorier and more bizarre stuff, but the way Martyrs is presented grabs you immediately by the throat and never lets go. There's no resting points in this picture. Once you go down the stairs you'll have to take the 1,000 steps without any time to breath. And that's one of the things that makes it so fantastic.<br />If you like your films to take your brain into the darkest of forests, then you're in for quite a rush. It's horror the way it's intended to crawl beneath your skin.
0882709194|1.0|I am, quite frankly, appalled with the introduction added onto this work. Evolution is a commonly accepted theory that evidence has confirmed time and time again, and this introduction which attempts to mislead those who buy this work via rather shady laws, is a disgusting piece of anti-science. I am a Christian, but also a scientist; I know that science is merely the observation and \\"documentation\\" of the truth's of the world, God's world, and thus any scientific observation made is simply learning more about this world. Evolution is one of those truths, and those that oppose it due to misconceptions and dogmatic views of science being in opposition to religion (like reality is in opposition to faith) are daft to an utmost degree.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am a moderate fan of the original series, that is to say that I have watched them many times on TV but do not own any of the episodes on DVD. I do own the original cast films #2-6 and they range from fun to terrific. This reboot was a blast with tons of cool effects and a story you can actually get into. Some hardcore trekkies will pass along some dirt on this one but I think it's a heck of a sci-fi flick with a good cast and script;  well worth my purchase on Blu-Ray. Oh, and by the way, the Blu-Ray disc looks and sounds amazing!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I don't pre-order movies very often at all though (hadn't since literally January) because I'm usually ok with waiting for price drops if I liked it enough that I'll want to watch it again sometime, so the fact that I pre-ordered this should be some indication of how blown away I was by this film. Months after seeing it there were scenes that stuck with me (much like my favorite of the year, Inglourious Basterds) and it proved further to me that this is a really fun film for repeat viewings. It puts together a well-constructed story (despite being controversial) with truly dedicated actors/actresses and grand set pieces that feel really worthwhile rather than tawdry reminders that this is a summer movie (that was actually intended originally for a winter release). If you haven't seen this movie then you really need to put renting it at the top of your list for movies to check out - definitely above pretty much anything playing in your local theater right now (at the time of this posting, at least).<br /><br />Moving swiftly along: I was a little disappointed with the overall presentation of this set. First of all, the slip case for the Blu-ray box had the back side with the run time and pictures and such just tacked on with the junk that credit card companies use to send you new cards. I like the fact that the Blu-ray case itself is full-on Chris Pine's face (the one peeking through the title on the slip case), and on the other side is a close up of Zachary Quinto's face as Spock. I loved the focus in the marketing of the theatrical release on the characters as being powerful enough imagery to sell the film - it's simple and it works. What I was really more disappointed in was the overall menu system. It's not terrible, but I just expected something cooler given that it's Star Trek, especially compared to Iron Man. There's also like 3 trailers (or ads, as I like to call them) and a video game ad to start the feature film disc, but I actually just figured out today that you can hit the 'pop-up menu' button on your Blu-ray player remote to skip straight to the top menu (I don't recall ever hitting any menu button a DVD and going straight to the main menu until I watched all the ads).<br /><br />Why am I whining about something so trivial? Because that's about all I can complain about here. I was floored by the ridiculous video quality here. I can't recommend it as a gold standard for introducing people to Blu-ray necessarily because it doesn't have bright colors like Planet Earth, but I think the only Blu-ray I own now that looks better than it is Wall-E. Still, the transitions between dark scenes in this movie and those with color are quite smooth with all the colors looking very true to how they should be (the more vibrant they're supposed to be the more awesome they look on your TV). There are a lot of face close ups in this movie and the clarity in even these shots made me want to get up off my couch and just applaud the folks who did this transfer. If you are disappointed with the video quality of this disc, no matter how big or high-end your TV is, there may be something wrong with you (or your TV video settings). I don't have a high-end surround system so I don't want to pass judgement on sound, but it does sound great as far as I can tell. I can't complain about anything except for that maybe it's a bit soft in some places. Clarity is stellar, even in scenes where I was afraid I would be straining my ears to understand what they're saying.<br /><br />There are so many special feature videos on the second disc that I couldn't get through all of them. What' truly remarkable is that each and every video you see on these discs is in high definition. I think the movie itself certainly looks better than the special features, but we're really talking about shades of gray here because they still look like you're watching an HD channel and whatever the aspect ratio is on them fits my widescreen TV perfectly (whereas the movie hasblack bars on top and bottom). There's actual more content here (in minutes) than the running time of the feature film, and this is one of those movies that actually has interesting backstories for how every aspect of the production process came about so they're pretty addictive if you have an afternoon/evening to spare going through them all. The deleted scenes are also more interesting than you normally find on a home video release, including the original opening sequence of Spock's birth. The only other features on this disc are a gag reel, all 3 trailers, and 3-d models of the Enterprise and Nero's vessels with details about specific parts of them. As a cherry on top, these features actually have subtitles (which, in my experience, is pretty rare). On the main disc, there's also commentary, which I didn't listen to a whole lot of it but I have to say that it was hard to stop watching once I did turn it on because it's very much like you're peering into the minds of the writers and producers in the format of a candid, relaxed conversation that doesn't feel forced or scripted at all. I don't usually listen to these, but I think I'll have to make an exception here.<br /><br />Simply put, if you have a Blu-ray player and liked Star Trek at all, you're really doing a disservice to yourself by not picking this up. The studios are trying this crazy thing now where they price Blu-rays equivalent to DVDs instead of price-gouging, so $20 for this one is more than reasonable. They really didn't put this out there to set up for a double dip, or they're doing so with great stupidity because I can't think of what else you'd realistically want from a Blu-ray set for this movie in any sort of re-release. It's going to quickly become one of favorite Blu-rays, for sure.ottom).

My first introduction to it was from a friend in Yosemite, sitting around the last glowing embers of a campfire beside Smedberg Lake, deep in the backcountry wilderness.  I'll forever associate the evocative qualities of this music with that place.  I bought this CD for my brother because I couldn't wait to share the experience with him.

B001QXE0OC|5.0|I have to admit, I'm a fan of Selena Gomez, but even if I wasn't, my opinion of this album wouldn't be any different. Kiss & Tell is a mix of pop, rock, and dance that keeps your attention, blows you away, and reveals a better view of Selena. Some people don't give Selena a first or second chance becuase she started out at Disney, and this album proves that to be an unfair judgement. She has an excellent voice, and it plays well in the album, no matter what the songs about or the background. My favorites are Falling Down, I Promise You, Naturally, More, and I Got U. Multiple songs can make you get up and dance from the first second, and some leave you with insight. Selena wrote some of the lyrics herself, and some songs display exactly what I feel when I can't express how I feel. The album is worth it 100% and it's NOT just a CD for 12 & under. Keep up the good work Selena!!!

B001ESYAJY|4.0|I have really gotten into movie soundtracks lately, and I just bought this one because I went out on a limb and bought the Casino Royale soundtrack and really liked it. This soundtrack is just like the movie. Quantum of Solace was a direct sequel to Casino Royale, and as a movie it was very good. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite AS good as Casino Royale, and many people were disappointed. This soundtrack is the same way. It's very good, but just not quite as good as Casino Royale. If you are a fan of the movies and Casino Royale's soundtrack, you will like it.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I watched this DVD this afternoon and yes it is very much improved over the last few McCartney concerts released. This needs to be released on Blu-ray really soon. It would be spectacular on Blu-ray. I'm really surprised that it didn't come out at the same time as the standard DVD.
B002NUULNG|5.0|I'm happy that a new generation of viewers may get the chance to see this groundbreaking Sci-Fi/Art movie with fresh eyes. And ears. I remember putting the film's audio on a cassette tape years ago so I could listen to it at work and in my car.. it was one of the first anime I remember that had a brilliant ambient score that drenched the film in a really eerie stoic mood. The remastered Skywalker sound soundtrack and effects track are a total joy to me, the music's dynamic range is captured better than ever, and a plethora of miscellaneous background effects flesh out the action better than ever.<br />In nearly every scene, the colors look deeper and more genuine than the original print.. there is alot more simulated depth of field, not only from newly inserted visuals, but just from some clever color and contrast tweaks.<br />And NO, I have no qualms with the added CGI elements. Mamoru Oshii approved all of them, and Oshii's ever reiterated themes in the series has always been disassociation, dehumanization and the philosophy of making dolls in human form... so for this viewer, having a few scenes where Major Kusanagi is re-visualized in an even more stylized and antiseptic digital shape doesn't bother me at all. It's the whole point of her character.<br /><br />The cropping that appears in some shots bothered me a little, but I get the feeling this wasn't done because it looked good, but because there wasn't another way to fix or alter color timing in the frame without it.<br /><br />The collector in me would also have preferred if the original cut of the film was included on a separate disc, but at the same time, as it's just a HD rip of the original film that I've seen a bazillion times anyway, it's not a deal breaker.<br /><br />I'm happy with this version.
B000000OUJ|5.0|liquid swords is definitely in my top 5 favorite hip-hop albums of all time.... i'm still listening it today like it came out yesterday.  i think gza is the most lyrical member of the clan, and this album outshone the sun in so many ways.  apart from gza's lyrical genius, rza's production makes be believe that there's no way that he could've crafted such brilliant beats on his own, plus the usage of classic kung-fu movie samples (although my favorite usage of movie samples is in \\"severe punishment\\" on wu-tang forever).  i mean look at it, there are a bunch of producers nowadays who struggle to make one banger.  rza produced WHOLE ALBUMS of CLASSIC BEATS (ob4cl, liquid swords, ironman among others, imo); i find it hard to believe that he didn't have an army of a production team behind him...
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Who would ever think that in 5:00pm traffic on a Friday just getting out of work could be so peaceful with this album in my car. I have listened to these songs an awful lot of times and I love the whole album. Amazing and highly highly recommended.     Best songs:    1. Edge of Desire 10/10  2. Crossroads 9/10  3. Do you know me 9/10  4. Who says 9/10  5. Heartbreak warfare 10/10  6. Assassin 10/10
190669415X|2.0|This review refers to the quality of the narrated audio, not the story itself.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first book and decided to try the audio version of the second in the series because I had a long trip ahead and thought it would be a fun way to pass the miles.  Unfortunately the narrator creates a thick cockney English accent for the key characters to represent Swedish vernacular.  Given that the story takes place in Sweden with Swedish people, the \\"ello govnah\\" slang doesn't make much sense and was a big distraction (for me).  The narrator, Simon Vance, gives Lisbeth a high-pitched, squeaky little girl's voice straight out of \\"East Enders\\" that lacks the assertiveness (or lack of emotion) that the character is supposed to possess. Luckily the book isn't heavy on dialogue because the general narration is tolerable.  I won't listen to the third book of the series, though.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The actors can't save the writing in this movie. Quinto and Urban are notable; I see hints they may have studied other Trek actors besides Nimoy and Kelley, namely Russ and Picardo. They deserve better than this driftwood of a flick ...    I was hoping for something on the same level as Tim Burton's remake of \\"Planet of the Apes\\", but \\"ST\\" doesn't come close. I'm not knocking JJ Abrams, but when a good director is forced to work in a straightjacket, you get mud. Blame Hollywood, which really doesn't know anymore why people would want to see a movie, nor why anyone would want to *make* a movie.    After the TV series \\"Enterprise\\" was cancelled, one of the Trek producer/writers said \\"We went to the well once too often.\\" Six months later this movie was announced. It was a very bad idea then, and it is almost as bad a fact, now. So much hard work, and so little to show for it in the end. Ugh ...    What should you buy instead? I don't know, try a big-ticket release from the not-so-recent past, and tell us about it. Ever wonder who \\"They\\" are? Check out the movie \\"Them\\", ah-hahahahahah ...
0316044695|4.0|I was very intrigued to learn about the events leading up to the largest loss of life in SEAL history.  The book starts out telling about SEAL training.  Being in the Navy, I pretty much already knew about the beating they take but it helps you understand how every SEAL is dedicated and the cream of the crop and why every SEAL can count on one another.  The author lets you get to know his buddies, the men he risked his life with.     I think this book was mostly a testament to these other 3 men of his SEAL team, how they never quit and paid the ultimate sacrifice.  The book is also about the love of strangers, all the people who helped Marcus' family get through the ordeal and keep their faith that he could still be alived.  I believe the book also told a great story of how Marcus narrowly survived and how villagers risked their life for his, showing that not all Muslims are bad and that there is compassion over there, although the author does show disrespect toward them from time to time.  I think the worst thing Marcus did was include his politics and love for George W. Bush.  I totally believe that you should have faith in your Commander in Chief, but I think Marcus could have showed that more tastefully.  Instead he comes off as a redneck and \\"Texas is the best\\" dolt.      Overall, the story and great men that gave their life on that day make this worth reading.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Paul McCartney's released many live CDs and DVDs but this is the best of the bunch he's released. Here's why; 1)We get the whole concert 2)the performances are dazzling (and Paul's in exceptional voice--no Autotune according to engineer Paul Hicks or any processing device was used to augment Paul's voice)including a brief detour into a cover of a Jimi Hendrix tune (he shares a story about Hendrix having learned \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" even though it had just been released. Hendrix's guitar went out of tune and he asked if Eric Clapton was in the audience so he could tune it for him). 3)We get a healthy dose of Beatles songs (including \\"A Day in the Life\\" melded with Lennon's \\"Give Peace A Chance\\"), Wings tunes, Fireman and McCartney solo hits. 4)We get to hear the concert and see it on a bonus DVD AND Best Buy has a 2 CD/2DVD set (available only as an import here)in a nice book with McCartney's \\"David Letterman\\" live roof top show.<br /><br />Sound-I'd give it a B for the CDs--they sound good not too loud, compressed or maximized could they sound better? Sure but for a contemporary CD this sounds good. The sound on the DVDs I'd give an A--they sound exceptionally clear, crisp with nice detail. The picture on the DVDs (I watched it upscaled on my Blu-ray player)looks exceptional as well. Would I have liked a Blu-ray option for this? Sure but the DVD looks just fine upscaled with nice detail although you'll notice it isn't quite as sharp as a Blu-ray.

It's the only big mistake here (although the uncut performance IS available on the 2 DVD set).<br /><br /> There is footage shot on digital cameras by the audience (they were distributed to fans for that purpose) intercut with the professional stuff.

As soon as I started to play the first song 'Wild Horses', I was stunned! Susan made every song so lovely! I am very pleased with this CD & would like to hear much more from her.

B0026P3G12|5.0|WELL WORTH the WAIT! Can't WAIT for your next CD, SUSAN!! It's like Christmastime today as I listen to your first commercial work, angel darling Susan Boyle. I can't tell you how I've been looking forward to your first album, dearest Susan. You brought tears to my eyes every time I watched you on You-tube over and over, and then I was lost in your version of `Cry me a River' as many times too. And now, I finally have your first and new CD. You have brought the tears and amazed me again and again.  Not only do you have a beautiful voice with great talent and skill, but you sing straight from the heart, Susan, and you reach directly to my own. Your loveable spirit shines through and reaches into the souls of others like me.  I love your song choices and your renditions of them. I was very happy that you chose to sing songs of faith and a Christmas carol too. That makes this album a Christmas gift in and of itself. I hope you will soon do a Christmas CD. I would also enjoy a CD of Christian hymns sung by you. I'm sure I will adore anything that you love enough to sing in your forthcoming CDs, for, with your heart in them, they will touch my own and the heart of millions of others. Keep singing Susan, and bring us many more CDs. I will look forward to much more from you, and in the meantime, I will thoroughly and many, many times enjoy this very special first from you. You are a gift to the world, and the world is better for having you, sweet Susan Boyle. Merry Christmas, Angel Susan.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|The Ga is great. No doubt about it, she is pure talent. I give 5 stars for the music. But to edit/censor her music is beyond belief. If a sliced version is to be sold, tell us and offer the unsliced as well. Amazon should also have alerted consumers regarding their purchase. I would be livid if I purchased the collector's edition, which I almost did, and found that it was censored, as all versions seem to be according to fans. Do not support the edited versions and make the record company responsible for their blunder, or perhaps their devious plan to keep re-selling what we have already bought. Only a free download of these songs would correct how I feel about this release.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This cd was well worth the wait. Ms. Boyle is amazing! Her voice goes straight to the heart. From the beginning to the end you'll want to listen to it again and again. Her renditions of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\" give the songs a fresh new beginning. \\"If she can dream so can we\\"!
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|This is really a tight collection of songs.  I really like this CD.  I dont care for the last track, \\"Teeth\\". As much as I love these songs though, I feel like they are not that original.  As her first CD was.  To me, \\"Speechless\\" sounds like a rip off of \\"Hurt\\" by Christina Aguilera and \\"Alejandro\\" is straight up Ace Of Base. Seriously.    \\"Telephone\\" is going to be a monster hit and is the best song on here.
0143113100|5.0|I came across this book looking at the reviews of a person who had reviewed \\"Amusing Ourselves To Death\\" by Neil Postman (a classic).  She had three reviews, a book on cats (I have 8 of the varmints), and also on this book. She was from Eastern Europe I believe.  I figured, \\"sounds like my kind of person\\", I will look into this book.    No he is not a great writer. The chapters do not flow, they are more like a set of related articles. But all in all, a book worth reading, and one that might change the way that you look at yourself, in terms of your ability to (with concentrated effort) reshape yourself.    Some trash this author in a nit picking manner. I see this often done on histories, other books of merit. They fail to appreciate or acknowledge that the book is full of very wise advice.  Or perhaps nit picking is just a psychological compulsion with some.  Who cares if other books have the same advice, or if the author is not a full fledged neurological research expert? That does not diminish from the value of this book. Most people want to find an efficient way to get from point A to point B. I find myself applying his model, and have found the results to be remarkably positive. I have greatly increased my capacity to memorize things, and to unlearn personally undesirable patterns of behavior, applying the principles presented by this author.

I assumed that by \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" They meant that they maybe cleaned up some scenes, added scenes, added some bonus features, anything but what I got. The movie begins with an apology from the Director which anticipates some of the abhorrent changes they made to the movie. This version is a total disgrace, violates much of the enchanting qualities of the film, and uses Comic Sans font none the less for the absolutely disruptive comic book scenes... Unwatchable in my opinion.
0385532458|1.0|Grisham is a favorite author, I have every book he has written, but, I must say Ford County was not worth wasting my time reading.  Other than the first story which was humorous, the remaining stories were just blah.  Made me wonder if he has a \\"ghost writer\\" doing his work.  Just didn't sound like his writing to me.  I'd love to read a really good Grisham book, maybe next one will be.

0156034026|5.0|The book depends for its success on the amazing ambiguity of fundamentals and the pervasiveness of ambivalence.<br />Some books can't really be reviewed without disclosing the ending, because they are largely defined by the ending.

A Pakistani returnee from Princeton and New York City talks to a foreigner, probably an American, but we don't know for sure. Whatever the other man does is disclosed to us only by the comments of the speaker. And how he loves talking! (I have lived in the country and have met many who had this same passion. It is generally quite likable.) The other is uneasy. He seems to know as little about the speaker as we.<br /><br />The speaker tells us about his expatriate life and his return home. He had been a high flyer in Princeton, then ditto at a firm in NY. He worked as a financial analyst. He learned to focus on the fundamentals. He had met an American beauty on a classmates' vacation in Greece and she introduced him to NY upper strata. His exotic cultivated superiority was attractive. He is from an upper class run down family background, like impoverished aristocracy.<br /><br />The turning point for me, when I stopped admiring the writing, was the first chapter and the follow up about the affair with the NY woman.

He is shocked at his own reaction.<br />Prior to this, he had already noticed sometimes that he put himself more in the place of the locals looking at his own team of company analysts, rather than as a genuine part of the American team. He sees Americans now as the `officer class' of globalization, and he partly wants to be in, while other parts of him want to be out of it.<br /><br />To his American colleagues on the job in Manila, he feigns shock at the attack. Upon arrival in NY, he gets treated with suspicion, but otherwise things seem to develop as before.

He drifts away from his `American perspective'. When he returns to his job, his attitude is gone. He grows a beard, as outward documentation of change.

015204907X|4.0|My husband was given this book by a client who is an early childhood expert. She certainly must know what she is talking about because our almost-three-year son instantly took to this book and demanded that we read it to him over and over. Children really respond to the rhythmic text, which contains lots of internal rhyme, and the inherent silliness of the quest for the green sheep. There are also some fun opposites (thin, wide; up, down; brave, scared), colors and other basic concepts for preschoolers. This book would work equally well for a girl or a boy from around age 2 to 4, in my opinion. Its a great addition to any library.

B002UXRH10|2.0|Is it just me or was I the only one who was absolutely DISAPPOINTED in Rihanna? I read some of the reviews where people are calling the cd \\"Darker\\" than the typical Rihanna cd and it confuses  me a little. I completely understand that Rihanna wants to show the world she is no longer a child and she truly is a \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" BUT I do not agree with this new image.     I got Rihanna's cd about 3 weeks before it was released and after 10 minutes of sampling through the cd I already decided I HATED it! I was a Rihanna fan; I loved the fact that she was such a pretty girl with a nice voice with such a good girl image representing the \\"innocent,\\" fresh youth of r&b singers. I remember when Rihanna first was exposed to television; she wore the belly shirts and baggy jeans, but she rocked them in such an \\"innocent\\" way. It was bad enough that Rihanna went through all that drama with Chris Brown and for the most part, I did not agree with some of the actions she took in that relationship. THEN, after seeing the NUDE pics....I was trying to give Rihanna the benefit of the doubt. After hearing this cd, Rihanna disappointed me for the last time. I was hoping that Rihanna would have something positive to say, something profound, and intimidating for other R&B singers, but I got my hopes up for nothing.     Like I stated before, I understand Rihanna wants to show the world that she is no longer a child, but still....Rihanna had an image that a lot of little girls admired! All that Rihanna proved to me is that she FINALLY is showing the world she has a POTTY MOUTH! Im was not impressed with what Rihanna's vocals (because she chose not to utilize them this time around), lyrics, or image for this cd! My little sister used to love Rihanna and now I have to BAN her from listening to her because Rihanna refers to herself as a disrespect word. For example....It's bad enough that the \\"N\\" word is tossed around like it is still not offensive, but to hear Rihanna voice it in here lyrics provides the image that little girls can say it too. Regardless if Rihanna likes it or not, she is still a child's icon! Children look up to her and I do not feel as if she is holding the appropriate image anymore. Me personally, I lost the little respect that I had left for Rihanna! A song in particular (for all the people who are going to ask for \\"proof\\") is G4L.     All I can say is \\"Why Rihanna....WHY?!\\" It is bad enough Hollywood will take the sweetest singer and create a monster, but to see it happen to someone who you thought would remain humble makes you look at things from another prospective.  Its a shame that she chose to take this route. I will not longer be a Rihanna fan and for all the parents interested in purchasing the cd, I would not even recommend purchasing the Clean version. On one of the songs (Russin Roulette), Rihanna explains about playing a game that was very popular back in the early 1900's from Russian Soldiers. Basically, in a nutshell, these soliders would place a single round in a revolver, which contains 6 barrels. In this song, she explains how the guy (she is obviously involved with) is, what we assume, pressures her to play. In this particular song, she explains that she is spooked, terrified, and down-right frightened, but she wants to prove herself to this particular guy. At the end of the song, you even hear the gunfire...which we assume SHE was the one who aimed the gun towards herself and emptied the chamber. My question is what is that telling our youth? I may not be a parent, but I have cousins, a little sister, nieces, and they are at a point where they have very impressionable minds! She told the press that she compares Russian Roulette to love and how you take a chance, but do our youth really understand that?     All I am saying is this....I do not agree with this new cd. I may get some offensive comments, but to be honest, they do not phase me! I am not looking at this cd as \\"What Sells,\\" I am criticizing this cd because Rihanna is just one of the many artists that CONTRIBUTE to the destruction of not only music, but also our YOUTH. When we take an image like what Rihanna has done with her life and expose it to our children, there should be no questions as to why they are disrespectful, disobedient, and learn to acquire such RAUNCHY LANGUAGE at young ages....  But I guess. Rihanna if you think this is what will make you a millionaire, go for it, but I WON'T PARTICIPATE IN THIS RUBBISH! I'm so glad I didn't waste my money! Yours truly - One disappointed EX FAN!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Yes, I thought, \\"Oh Lord, not another one!\\" Esp. since I was a fan of the original series and not any of the others.  You can't top the first one out of the gate. Then I saw that this was a pre-series character discovery.  The more of the trailer I saw the more I was thinking, \\"Ok, I have to see this!\\"  That night(I saw the trailer in the theater before the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace\\") I got onto Netflix and added Star Trek to my queue, so I wouldn't forget.    Months later, I received it in the mail and was thoroughly entertained, impressed, etc... The story was a little thin, not bad though.  There were things that bothered me, the whole Vulcan being destroyed, but then, thankfully, Spock came to the rescue. My concern was that they weren't following anything from many of the previous Star Trek movies. Vulcan hadn't been destroyed, etc...they were changing so many things.  But, then Spock came about and talked about how all their destiny's had been changed because that nasty dude, Nero, came through and destroyed that ship and killed Kirks dad and so forth.  Things had totally been changed, I needed that pointed out, made things clearer, and whenever I got a tad confused I went back to that.      The characters were great!  The people playing them were spot on!  Quinto was vintage Spock. Kirk, handsome and rebellious, Bones, pissy and emotional with his little quirks; Scotty, what can I say freakin funny (LOL), Sulu, Chekov, his speaking was funny and sweet and he played the roll great...all perfect.  The humor was fantastic and not over the top but placed perfectly. I was bothered at times, like when they eject Kirk and maroon him on that frozen ice cube, seemed to get a tad off topic but then it quickly showed why.  Had to get to the older Spock and then find Scotty (who was a freakin hoot!)      The music wasn't the greatest, seemed campy, maybe they wanted it that way.  Loved the way they filmed it, imperfect and real, light flares everywhere, made itauthentic.  I'm sick of people always going for perfection, that takes away the realism sometimes.  Abrams did a fantastic job and I hope he'll happily sign-on and do another one.  They left it wide open for more to come, and I very much hope they do!
0060254920|5.0|Maurice Sendak's wonderful art is the first thing that hits you about this book. The story is simple - a boy does naughty things, is sent off to bed without dinner. He goes (in his mind) to a fantasy land where the wild things are... but hunger makes him return to his room - to find a hot dinner waiting for him there. Mommy did not have the heart to *really* send him to bed without dinner after all!<br /><br />The text lends itself to a nice rhythmic reading, there's lots of drama in it with monsters and partying. Yet the little boy in the middle of his wild freedom, wants parental comfort:<br /><br />\\"And Max, the king of all wild things, was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.\\"<br /><br />To give an idea of the poetic nature of the story, here's a snippet, where Max travels back from the place where the wild things are:<br /><br />\\"... sailed back over a year<br />and in and out of weeks<br />and through a day...\\"<br /><br />I love the way reality and fantasy are spun together in this story. My kids, 5.5 yrs and 3.5 yrs, love the book as well.
B002UXRH10|4.0|Off the bat, Rihanna knocks it outta the park with her 3rd album.  Like the cover suggests its darker, and definitely more personal.  Each song you can sense the deeper undertones she's trying to address.  Most of the songs hit the mark of staying within theme, and you get to see a more intimate side of this young icon.      It's easy to suggest that a lot of the themes were drawn out due to her unwanted publicity behind a former lover and the torrential breakup.  The events, although horrific, do set the tone and frame of reference most likely being referred to in most of the songs.  I know others have mentioned its quite a different look for her, but anyone who's seen her performances as of late have seen her darker, more punk attitude.      Revenge?  Well I wonder how Brown would react to hearing some of the tracks and whether any of it would surprise him, but I do feel she hits all the right marks in getting all her emotions expressed and bringing about another dimension to keep loyal followers intrigued and surprised.
B00132GBRA|1.0|The ONLY good things about these boots are: they look good and they are comfortable and lightweight.  Construction, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I had been wearing these boots for 1-2 months when I noticed that the soles of both boots had begun separating from the uppers.  I've read reviews on other websites that indicate this is not an isolated incident.  My boots saw nothing wilder than a sidewalk or two.  I wore them only to work, and since most of the time I'm in the office, use or abuse is NOT the problem.  I wrote to Merrell regarding this problem and did receive a reply.  From the tone of the reply it was immediately obvious that nobody had actually read my e-mail because their reply was nothing more than a form letter stating that they are not responsible for damage due to abuse, blah blah blah ad nauseum.  So, I again e-mailed Merrell and told them what I thought of their boots and their previous reply. NOW they want to make it right and so forth and so on!  I informed Merrell that I would rather spend $5 on ShoeGoo than to have to pay at least twice that amount to ship these boots back to them.  So, save up your money and buy a REAL pair of boots, NOT some CRAP made in China! These are about as tough as a pair of little pink bunny house slippers.  Seriously, they would be overpriced at $29.95!  Zero stars is what they truly deserve.  Sidebar..I purchased my boots from a retailer other than Amazon.  Same doodoo, different dealer.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|I just purchased a pair of Turtle Beach x41's off Amazon. Here's a little review, based on my limited experience with them.    The Good:      + Easy to setup. The instructions are somewhat abstruse, and not detailed. I had to sort of fill in the blanks, but overall it was quite easy. I think anyone can do it.    + Comfortable. The headset is lightweight, and has decent padding. It does begin to hurt my ears after a couple hours.    + Features. The x41 offers a ton of awesome features, including RF technology and Dolby Digital 7.1.      The Bad:       - The transmitter cannot be connected to my LCD HDTV via the optical port and still get Dolby Digital surround sound. You NEED the Xbox 360's AV/Optical plugs in order to access DD 7.1. Most new Xbox's don't include this cable, so it's an additional expense if you want to use this headset. No point in buying these instead of the x31's if you can't get Dolby.    - Occasional scratching, popping, cutting. Nothing destroys immersion and distracts me more than when the sound pops and cuts in the middle of your game. This is not associated with the chat cable's notorious scratching and popping. This is due to a bad RF connection or interference or something. The problem is enhanced if you're downloading anything via a nearby wifi. The headset will often pop so loudly, that all audio is cut for a few seconds, and gradually returns. The pops are occasionally so loud and abrupt, that I wouldn't be surprised if it damaged someone's eardrums.    - The volume turn dials are awkward and poorly designed. The volume dial on the headset won't register any volume until it's turned about 3/4 of the way to MAX. From the 3/4 mark, it increases RAPIDLY. The chat volume dial is even more sensitive. This makes fine tuning a ridiculous chore, and quite impossible.    - Can barely hear myself talk. Turtle Beach purposefully dialed back the monitor volume of the x41's. When I talk into the microphone, it feels as if I'm deaf or underwater. Themicrophone has other issues with pickup. Sometimes my team mates can't hear me, and other times they say my voice is too loud (because I have to talk loudly in order to get the microphone to pick up the sound). There is no consistency. Also, the microphone causes a steady hissing sound whenever it's attached. When it's not attached, there is still a noticeable buzzing hiss when the game or movie gets quiet.         The Ugly:      -- This is the reason I returned this headset. The volume in the left ear cup is louder than the volume in the right ear cup. This is the case with every game and movie I've tried. I thought I may have installed it wrong, so I re did the installation and setup. Didn't work. I tried changing out the brand new AAA batteries, nothing. I tried changing the setting on my Xbox, nothing. I contacted Turtle Beach, but they haven't been able to help at all.     In every game with background music (all games?), I can only hear the drum and bass in the left side. I tested this with every game, and even audio CD's. I also did a test on Xbox Live with some friends. In Modern Warfare 2, I had a friend stand a few meters in front of me and fire off his automatic rifle in the air. It sounded as if the gun was somewhere to the left. When he stood directly in front of me (1 inch from my face) and fired, it sounded as if it was coming from below me and to the left. Then I had him stand a few meters off and fire clips in the air while I stood in one place and spun around in circles. I was hoping the sound would be \\"circling\\" me, but instead it sounded as if it was coming from above/below me when it was supposed to be on my right side. Later in another match, I was approaching a doorway, and I heard someone reload on the left side of the doorway. So I watch the left corner when entering, but in turned out the guy was on the right side of the doorway. Because the headset was louder on the left side, it sounded as if the guy was to the left of me.    I put the headset down, and hooked up my $14.99 Microsoft one, and I guess that says it all. I wish this headset worked. I paid $170 for it, but the lop-sided volume is killing it for me. It's unbearable, and surely less than what I expected for the price.    And don't assume I have a hearing problem in my right ear. I've had several people verify that the left side is noticibly louder. Plus when I reverse the headset, the left side will be louder on my right ear.      I'm giving this headset 1 star, as I feel it's defective. I'm exchanging them for a working pair, and will update this review when they arrive. Besides the negative things I've listed, I like these headphones. If the volume wasn't lop-sided and utterly unbearable, I would've kept them and given them 3 or 4 stars.               ***UPDATE***      I just received a replacement pair of Turtle Beach X41's from Amazon. I set them up exactly the same way as the previous defective pair, however, these one's seem to work. The lop-sided volume I experienced in the first set is no longer an issue. I can actually hear the Dolby surround sound in effect this time.       It's not all sunshine and daisies. This pair comes equipped with a host of new problems. Before purchasing the first pair, I had done some research on the Turtle Beach website and forum. It seems that a lot of x41's are experiencing a similar problem where the in-game audio will cut, pop, scratch, etc. So it wasn't a total surprise when my replacement pair started exhibiting these problems. This audio-cutting is a lot worse on my replacement pair, than it was on my original defective pair, for some reason. The \\"popping\\" is much louder than the first pair. I was watching a DVD and when the audio \\"popped\\" it actually hurt my eardrums. The popping happens suddenly, and is much louder than the volume of the game or DVD, so I wouldn't be surprised if it caused someone ear damage eventually.     And the volume is another issue. My original defective pair seemed to have adequate volume levels. This new pair, however, has a very low maximum volume level (when it's not popping). This is another wide-spread issue expressed on the Turtle Beach forums. From the Turtle Beach support guy, I've deduced that Dolby, in collaboration with Turtle Beach, decided to \\"dial back\\" the volume on the x41 so as not to damage the user's ear drums. There's an inherent problem with this. While the volume on several games are adequate, the volume of most DVD's are certainly not. I tried several DVD's in my Xbox 360 and only one had an acceptable volume level.     For example: I wanted to test out the difference in audio volume levels between games and DVD's. I played Modern Warfare 2, and the volume was decent. At MAX volume, it sounded about 90% as loud as I would have liked. I can accept that, knowing it's saving my eardrums. Then I popped in the DVD \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" to gauge the volume level of DVD gunshots in comparison to videogame gunshots, and it's maybe 60% as loud as I'd like. I then tried several other DVD's, including loud action epics, and softer comedies that are filled with spoken-volume dialogue. Both genres offer inadequate volume levels. In the action movies, the loud explosions are not as \\"exciting\\" as I'd hoped they'd be. In comedies and dramas, the dialogue isn't loud enough to be enjoyable. If I was listening to DVD's via my home theater system, I would set the volume much louder than I am able to in these headphones.     That's the problem. I don't understand why Turtle Beach would limit the maximum volume levels when they know that many DVD's and games have differing audio levels. Sometimes the max volume is perfect, and it seems Turtle Beach did their homework. Most of the time I wish I could turn the volume up a little or a lot, depending on whether I'm playing a game or watching a DVD. There's no reason to not give us the option to increase the volume beyond Dolby's recommended level. In fact, that argument is flawed, as I havea 5.1 Dolby surround sound system that certainly is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH louder than these headphones could ever be.     Another issue I have with these x41's is the low level hiss. If you've looked at the Turtle Beach forums, you'd be well aware of the low level hiss complaints. This seems to be another wide-spread issue with x41's. When you turn the set on, you'll hear the hiss. When the game or DVD audio is quiet, even for a second, you'll hear the hiss. This is not a huge problem during most games, as there is usually constant ambient noise to mask the hiss. But with certain DVD's, the low hiss will be unbearable. Movie dialogue is a low level hiss extravaganza. This, coupled with the low volume levels, make watching certain DVD's a chore.     Nitpicking:     I would be nice if you could pair more than one x41 headset to the transmitter. When I have friends over, I wish we could both enjoy Dolby quality audio while we play co-op games or whatever.     I wish the x41's were noise canceling. While the headset volume is quite low, you can hear it quite easily from across the room. So if you're like me, and you occasionally play games in close proximity to a sleeping girlfriend, then you assume the risk of waking her up and consequently having an angry girlfriend.           But don't think that the x41 is all bad. The x41 sound quality, when it's not popping or hissing and when the volume level is adequate, is excellent. The ergonomics and comfort are also very good. The build quality and materials are good and bad. The leather top band is adequately padded and comfortable. The chat cable, on the other hand, is made with the same quality as the $14.99 Microsoft headset. Actually, it's worse, since the Turtle Beach has annoyingly sensitive volume controls.    I really tried to tackle every flaw the Turtle Beach Ear Force x41's have. For a $170 headset, I feel it should stand up to even the harshest scrutiny. But in the end, I'm keeping this headset, flaws and all. It's certainly not perfect, but what is? Hopefully Turtle Beach will examine the x41's flaws and take steps to improve the next iteration.      Take this review with as many grains of salt as you need.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I received my cd a few weeks ago. I was extremely excited, but soon  disappointed-not worth the money. While I luv MJ's music, this 2-cd set is a rip off,(shame on SONY). If you already have MJ's Number One's CD, you don't need this unless you are only purchasing it for the song \\"This is it\\", which is on the cd in two versions, but sound the same. All the cut's are on the Number One's CD, except THIS IS IT, and the 3 bonus cuts on the 2nd CD.The bonus tracks are not the best-I don't even listen to that CD. Save your money, unless you just have to have \\"This is it\\". Sorry for the bad, but honest review.
0385504225|2.0|I have read all of the previous Dan Brown offerings.  Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons were outstanding.  The Lost Symbol is almost as good at times - esp as relates to unraveling the \\"mystery\\".  The evil villain is a give away rather early on and the location of the sought after treasure was a give away as soon as puzzle was presented.    Disappointing as a followup to Da Vinci and Angels.  If someone is just discovering Brown it is an okay read.  Doesn't live up to the hype.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The first time I ever got cold chills while listening to someone sing was when I heard Susan Boyle sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" in her debut performance on YouTube.  The second time was when I heard the same song on her new album.    I don't know what it is about her.  I only know that I am very definitely hoping for a second album.  She's a marvel.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Have you ever seen Pat in concert? If so then you've certainly noticed that at times he starts blasting away on riffs that almost cause him to levitate off stage. He get's such a passion going for the music he hops and jumps when the energy happens. And there can be no doubt that 'jump' is what he is trying to capture with this recording, is the essence of that moment in time when the energy of the music moves you in one direction, UP!!  It's a contemporary recording of our time yet rooted in the classics of yore.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I, along with everyone else, have waited a long time for Susan Boyle's new CD to be released.  I bought it today, and have listened to it several times already.  I absolutely love it!  The songs suit her voice very well, and her voice is just lovely.
1594481717|3.0|Pretty good - a bit fluffy and padded to make it into a book. A ten apge article could probably have said it all.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Music enthusiasts go out and buy SUSAN BOYLE's cd. It is superlative. Gorgeous vocals. Outstanding studio musicians. Excellent song list. She was not a one song wonder. Is it silly of me to be joyous that her voice will be heard!!!<br />Not overproduced at all.  As some young artists are done today. 30 layers of their voice and 12 back up singers to make them sound half way decent.<br />Susan and her production team let The Voice be heard. Hallelujah.  Kudos to Susan for her amazing success. Long may it continue.  And kudos to the arrangers, producers, studio musicians for a stunningly gorgeous musical experience.  Without gimmicks and<br />not a whisper of vulgarity.  I was going to buy several for friends. But, Sweet Susan was sold out at several locations already!!!!!!  I'm listening to it for about the 15th time since yesterday morning.  Gosh, truly it is lovely. Lovely.  This is what she was born to do.<br />She is who she was born to be!!
0316069906|5.0|This is tough stuff. It is by no means easy to read about the cruelty that is inflicted on animals within food factories. And as hard as it is to read about, it's important that this information be made public, and something is done about it.  The book is presented in a somewhat unconventional structure, and the most compelling section is the story of going undercover into the factory.  Strong research.  The section on turkeys right before Thanksgiving was devastating. The part that hit me hardest was the  sadism of some of the workers, particularly with pigs.  On another note:  Foer starts the book with the words \\"When I was young...\\"  which was interesting, because, in many eyes, he's Still young. Not that that means anything in the case of the book-- it just seemed an interesting comment, especially from someone lambasted in the past for \\"being young.\\"  That aside: the book is recommended. Although there are some funny moments, some is really hard to 'look at'. but hopefully it will help to change people's behavior and buying habits with food (even if you don't go vegetarian, but can be aware of who and what you're supporting), and help change a most important and often overlooked avenue of industry, life, and suffering.
B0026P3G12|5.0|First at all, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT!  When I heard leaked \\"White Horse\\", it didn't impress me much because I am a die-hard fan of catchy songs. However, just two days ago, after listening a few songs from her debut album in my friend's car. I changed my mind completely. Her voice is incredible. I decided to buy this album, and totally satisfied with it. It is hard to find a CD that every single track is great. Her talent seems to purify my soul.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This is a must see movie!  Its creepy, scary, and fun!  A truly entertaining film!
B002M3SOWO|5.0|Amazing is what I have to say about this book and its entire series.  You will never see Greek Mythology in the same light.  A bold daring and refreshing approach.  Rick's coming out with a new series based on the Egyptian God's and I cannot wait!!!  Loved every minute of these books could not put them down. Buy yourself one and get someone a set for themselves.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD has the most beautiful accompaniment, and Susan's voice is the perfect fit for it.  I can't wait for her next CD.
0312570740|4.0|As much as any book can, The King of Oil reveals an incredible amount of information into the world of Marc Rich.  Because Marc Rich is so secretive it is hard to compare this book to any other written pieces about him.....but this book is fascinating because it touches upon the geopolitics, the emergence of the spot market for oil, commodity trading, presidential politics, business etc.      The downside of this book is that it doesn't reveal \\"how\\" Marc Rich won crucial contracts, established relationships and competed with other commodity traders.  Perhaps it's too hard to reconstruct the deal-making conversations, but it would be interesting to hear the inside stories of those critical turning points in his career.      The book is an easy read and well worth it for anyone who is interested in the intersection of geopolitics and business.
B00003CXDD|4.0|The 80s had some great fantasy movies and this one is no exception.  Great storyline!  Love it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I don't usually rate anything 5 stars.  I rarely post reviews.  This is an exception. I just received this CD and I must say, this is the first artist in a long time that touches my soul so much I actually have chills at times listening to the songs.  Her talent is natural and not covered by technology or trained by professionals.  I first caught a glimpse of Susan on one of the America's Got Talent.  She had both me and my husband in awe. I immediately searched Amazon when I learned she was making and album and preordered it.  Love the song selections as they do show the true talent of this remarkable artist.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle writes \\"I would like to dedicate this album (CD)to my beloved Mother, to whom I made a promise to 'be someone'.\\"  Susan has kept that promise. She is an Angel with a  truly Angelic voice.  She is one of the best, if not the very best, newcomer around.
0805017593|3.0|I never received any sort of contact from this seller until I e-mailed them with my concern.  They were very short and offered no apology for it taking nearly a month to get here.  I will not purchase from them again.
0385504225|1.0|I'm not going to add more to what was already said in these reviews except that this was the 1st Dan Brown book I read and was completely disappointed by the ending.  The build up (which was only OK), culminated in such a disappointment...  I guess I expected more from the author of other great stories.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Wow, I read some of the bad reviews and was blown away that they hated it so much.  I'm a star trek fan (I cant tell you all the details of every single event that ever happened in star trek) that loved, loved, loved this film.  The haters have to get over themselves and their big brains.      Of course there are some plot flaws that are obvious but ITS A MOVIE!!  They couldn't have done a better job on the casting, Bones was a little over the top, but after watching it at home he grows on you.  I simply cant believe the haters were not enjoying this film.  Chris Pine is awesome as Kirk.      Sorry I just have to defend this film, I think some people want to hate on something so they can pretend to be \\"smart trekkies\\".  I know 99.9% of the people who watch this will think its awesome like ME!
B0017R5UA0|5.0|Ok, this is an easy 5 star.....  A band comes along every so often that blows you away.  Fleet Foxes is first band in awhile that did knock me off my feet. While cruising around on youtube looking for new tunes somehow I came across Winter Hymnal and it changed my life...  The folk rock genre is where I have been spending most of my new music budget, and what I have been listening to the last couple of years.  This music has such a good mix of lyrics, instruments and vocal harmony..  Overall my new favorite band of 2009...    Amazon shipped it fast and for a good price.
B001JOIEZ4|4.0|If you're expecting the songs from this soundtrack to fit cohesively with the movie, you will be confused but not necessarily disappointed.  If you're able to listen to the soundtrack as an independent album and just appreciate the music...you will enjoy it much more.<br /><br />I love Paramore's \\"Decode\\" but after listening to the lyrics, I realize that this song must have been written after reading New Moon.  I was confused by this song's inclusion in Twilight but after reading New Moon, it makes so much more sense.<br /><br />Of course I love Muse and I don't know that this was the best song to showcase their amazing talent but it did fit well enough in the family softball scene.<br /><br />Iron and Wine's Flightless Bird American Mouth was also a beautiful song to end the movie with.  It was lovely watching Edward and Bella dance to this in the last scene.<br /><br />I also really liked Blue Foundation's Eyes on Fire...great great song.<br /><br />All and all the songs on this CD are pretty great but the album definitely lacks cohesion.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|I am a big Michael Buble fan, and I waited eagerly for this new release.  All I can say is, \\"What a letdown!\\"  Honestly, the only song I REALLY liked on the whole CD was \\"Haven't Met You Yet.\\"  All of the others were stale retreads of songs I've never especially liked, or way over-produced versions of old standards (\\"Cry Me A River\\" is the most glaring example of this).  Michael's last CD, \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\", was so wonderful, so intense, so beautifully performed, that I bought \\"Crazy Love\\" without hearing any of the tracks.  I'm sorry to say that I will no longer be able to do that.  This whole CD sounds as if Michael Buble just phoned in his performances, and he is capable of SO MUCH more.  \\"Crazy Love\\" was really disappointing!!!
0316069906|4.0|Jonathan Safran Foer's new book, Eating Animals, presents a conversational approach to a topic in which we engage daily: eating. When his wife was pregnant with their first child, Foer decided to pay closer attention to food, having made eclectic food choices until that time, from vegetarian to omnivore. Trying to be a good parent, he wanted to make informed, thoughtful choices about food for his child. He spent 18 months visiting farms around the country, and the book gives ample space for farmers to describe how they do what they do, on our behalf and in response to what we desire. There are pages in Eating Animals that will take away your appetite, especially those that describe the practices of factory farming. As described in this book, factory farming is hard to defend. But Foer's writing style makes reading Eating Animals easy to swallow, but here's a warning: you may change what you eat after reading this book. Eating is cultural: we gather at table and tell our stories. Our favorite foods are often tied to our closest relationships. Foer makes that point strongly: food is culture, habit and identity. The lingering question is: should we change habits, especially when it comes to eating animals that come from factory farms? Read Eating Animals, and consider the question for you and your family.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B002HNA9LS|5.0|There are many survey-like compilations available these days covering musical styles, compositon types, periods, artists, composers-complete-works, and much more. This set stands out as a unique triumph in the hoard though. Few compilations combine high-quality presentation and selection with equally exemplary artistic quality. Most of the CDs in this collection would cost $14-20 individually, and many continue to top the lists of recommended recordings of the individual works. Harmonia Mundi has drawn from some of their best artists, such as conductors Rene Jacobs and Phillipe Herreweghe, for this set. There are no second-rate performances here! The selections are presented in chronological order covering periods from the earliest days of Christianity to the late twentieth century. With \\"only\\" 30 CDs, the set certainly only touches the tip of the iceberg of Western Sacred Music. But I cannot think of a better place to send someone to get a good survey of the development of that genre over the centuries.    The additional CD of sung texts is also excellent.    Collectors should not overlook the set either. I possess several thousand CDs, and there are only 2 CDs in the set that are duplicates of recordings already in my existing archives.     I am sure the set will not be on the shelves (in the warehouses is probably the better terminology these days) very long, so don't hesitate.    I would only hesitate to buy this box if you do not have much time to just sit quietly and listen to the extraordinary music without interruptions or distractions. After all, this is \\"Sacred\\" music, designed to relieve the anxieties, stir the soul, and calm the heart. This music must be both heard and experienced. And you can't do that if you listen to it while sweeping the pfloor, reading email, perusing a magazine, etc.
0786271531|5.0|This book is about a boy named Jonas. He lives in a town that's really scary.   - Docotrs give everyone a pill when they start to get \\"Love feelings\\"  - They have people called \\"Birthmothers\\" that have kids.  - No one can see color  - When twins are born, the lightest one is given a shot to die and then thrown out. (There can't be doubles in a boring town like this)    Well, anyway, I read this book last year in my 7th grade class. About 160+ pages.   \\"The Giver\\" is the dude who teaches Jonas to see color.    Ok, I know it sounds boring, but IT'S NOT! It's a page turner. :) Enjoy.
B0027G783W|5.0|I began to think Moby was losing his edge and was not a fan of his last effort at all.  On this disc he shows he is back on the right path to offering some beautiful, catchy ambient tunes.  If you are a fan of Moby's ambient and mid-school stuff, you'll dig this new one!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This is such a good movie.  It kept me glued to the screen and mesmerized.  The series are great, I already have the second movie, Stone Cold, and that is just as good.  This movie had Tom Selleck in mind for the character and he is perfect.
0061766089|4.0|I was hoping this could perhaps inspire me as I begin my career and to see how the world could use more \\"design\\" oriented thinking.  While there are certainly many interesting examples and ideas in the book I think this may be more geared towards people in management or in business for themselves.  To be sure, the ideas seem rock solid, the kind of holistic thinking that is advocated in the book IS what makes many of the most successful companies in the world.  But, again, i feel like \\"little old me\\" can't really make the kind of changes in a corporate environment that would be necessary.  But I guess if part of the point is simply to put the idea of \\"Design thinking\\" out there, then this book deserves to be read by those who are in positions to make those changes.  I know I will appreciate the concepts taught in this book if/when I reach that point in my career.
0132350882|5.0|Let's get this out of the way right now: There are a LOT of books out there about improving your programming style. Even books that aren't about coding style tend to have at least a chapter or two on it, or pepper the text throughout with capsule suggestions on good style.    In my experience, these books fall into three categories.    The first category is the \\"safe\\" category. It offers obvious, unchallenging homilies about exception safety and RAII. It'll make you feel good about yourself because you're already doing most of the things; and the ones you're not, you will have already thought about doing and have good reasons for not doing. This first category does not improve the coding style of already decent programmers.    The second category is more crotchety and conservative. This is the camp that would have you never have multiple returns from functions, and document every single function with a ten-line preamble comment (more if the function actually does anything). This type is more daring, and may have some good suggestions, but it's difficult to find them because they're hidden in reams of bad suggestions which can be discarded without much thought. This category is also \\"safe\\", not because it tells you things you already know, but because it tells you things you can ignore.    The third category is this book. It's not a safe book. Many of the suggestions will mystify or anger you. They'll sound ridiculously Panglossian, impractical for any but the most trivial of codebases. Others will strike you as trivially obvious, which will irritate you, until you realize that you're not following them, which will irritate you more. This is a book which will change you, for the better.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Ms Boyle delivers a sublime album worthy of attention and multiple listens.  There are no weak cuts, but there are those I've played over and over again.     Just a few comments about some of the songs.    \\"Wild Horses\\" is everything one expected it to be from earlier listening.  Her voice is beautiful as is how she conveys the words of this song.    \\"Daydream Believer\\"  is really to be believed!  She slows it down and makes it so sweet I keep going back to hear more.  She has made it her own!    \\"Who I Was Born To Be,\\" \\"Proud,\\" and \\"The End Of The World\\"  are the strength of this CD.  Each is emotional without being loud.  Her voice is subtle and sublime!    I was truly surprized by the soft numbers on this CD.  Her voice is beautiful in all rangers, but particularly so when soft and in her lower range.    My advice:  Run, don't walk, to your computer or nearest CD outlet and buy this wonderful album.  Truly outstanding!!

Many of us know of someone that is afflicted by it but cannot sense how it affects the patient and everyone around them. I am glad I read it.  It is a novel that is instructive and can prepare anyone for the devastating reality of this disease. I recommend it to anyone that is interested in learning more about how the disease works on the patient and the family.

B00003CXB4|5.0|I wish that the many people who rated the actual movie low because of their rotten sellers would have given the actual seller the negative rating/feedback and/or name the seller here (that may have helped me and others who just purchased this dvd and those who are about to purchase it).    My seller was Gabriel B and I bought the dvd listed as \\"New and factory sealed\\".  No way.  Someone sealed it, but it was not the factory and the dvd was not new.  It works, my children love the movie itself, but the quality of it is not good.  (That could be partially attributed to the fact that it may have not been digitally remastered by Disney?)  I'm just glad that I didn't pay an outrageous price for it--I paid what the dvd is currently going for as Used/Like New, so I'm satisfied, but won't purchase from the seller again.
B002XSP16A|5.0|This album is BEAUTIFUL! It is a slower, relaxing album that shows us that Susan isn't limited to belting out a power ballad, but does leave me hoping that she does put out many more albums hopefully exploring her ability to sing with power and strength in the next.    Luckily most of the songs selected are vastly different renditions from the recordings we originally know them by. The lyrics are the basis for the selection, and in Susan's style have an interpretation that, again, may be different from what we used to think of them.    The overall feeling from the album is one of self reflection. A recognition of the injustices of life without a feelings of pity, sorrow, or regret. The religious overtones were unexpected, but in context are not out of place. It isn't unreasonable to imagine Susan turning exclusively to religious recordings in the future, although I sincerely hope that she does not.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I was at Target the other day. I decided to get Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster on a whim. I have to admit I hadn't heard the first single \\"Bad Romance\\" so I didn't know whether or not I would like it as a whole, but as a fan of Lady Gaga's music I just had to buy it. I am so glad that I did. The 34 minute album was definitely worth the money. The Fame Monster is even more addictive than The Fame. I consider The Fame Monster an extension of The Fame but with a more '80s new wave edge in the music. Unlike The Fame though, I didn't find one song on the album that I wanted to skip. I love just how infectious the melodies are as well as the distinct '80s new wave sounding the songs have. The songs that really stuck out with me is \\"Bad Romance\\" and \\"Dance in the Dark\\". Both songs are unbelievably catchy. The melodies just sticks in my head. \\"Bad Romance\\" is really addictive. I find myself playing this song quite a bit. I also love Lady Gaga's vocals. I think she sounds even better on this album. \\"Dance in the Dark\\" sounds like it came straight out of the 1980s with its crisp synth beats. Normally I have never been fond of Lady Gaga's ballads but I totally dug \\"Speechless\\". I'm glad Lady Gaga ditched the r&b influence from her previous album for a more retro vibe. It is much more fitting given her persona and fashion style. What I didn't care for was Beyonce's vocals on \\"Telephone\\". She is the only thing that dragged down the album for me. Never was a fan of Beyonce, and never will be. I personally wasn't bothered by the lyrics. I don't care if they were clean or dirty. I enjoyed The Fame Monster.
B001V9LRV0|1.0|I think Kockenlocker \\"Thrusting Greatness\\" said it best. The analog VHS is far superior to any of the digital conversions and the Blu Ray is just a copy of the first D/C.

For the time being anybody who would like the memories seek out analog; the D/C was done out of greed not Love.........  Peace..........
0882709194|1.0|Ordinarily one would be excited to receive the gift of \\"Origin of species\\" by Charles Darwin which brings to light evolution, Darwin's personal observations, and has been an extremely influential document from its date of publication to today in biology sciences. So, when I received a free copy of this book at my local college campus where they were giving away HUNDREDS of free copies, I was at first happy to have a copy of origin of species at no cost. However, that feeling quickly changed. What I received free of cost was a gimped version of origin of species with missing chapters and content with a 50-page introduction by Ray \\"Banana man\\" comfort, an evangelical propagandist. The 50 page introduction is loaded with fallacies, personal attacks on Darwin, and misleading religious indoctrination implanted by comfort. Ray comfort makes many, many crucial mistakes in his argument, a few of which are: 1) relating evolution to life's creation. This is invalid because evolution is simply an explanation for the variation of life; not where it came from (abiogenisis). 2) a very large portion of the introduction is simply dedicated to personal attacks on Darwin, which have nothing at all to do with why evolution is \\"false\\". 3) Many of his \\"quotes\\" taken from scientists (such as Jay Gould) are either skewed, out of context, quote mined, misrepresented, or were unverified years ago but have since been verified as false. These are only a few basic reasons this version is a blatant falsehood hiding under the guise of logical skepticism, there are literally THOUSANDS of falsehoods lying within those 50 pages. This version was also distributed (for free) at the top 50 colleges in the US as of November 16th (which is where I obtained my free copy) and is an injustice to science, biologic teachings, and readers in general everywhere. I doubt Darwin would be happy to see his work spit upon, misrepresented, and littered with half-truths by someone like Comfort. I also have Comfort tothink for repeatedly making us regular Christians look stupid, arrogant, and ignorant. Thanks ray, for making everybody despise us regular Christians even more by proving how big of liars evangelicals like you can be. Please don't take Ray as an example for Christianity; most of us know evolution is a fact and can easily and logically reconcile it with our religious beliefs. But, people like Comfort (who are young earth creationists and think the bible is the LITERAL word of god, IE dinosaurs lived with man, the earth is 6,000 years old, etc..) cannot, so they sling mud on science and ordinary Christians everywhere by using deceit in order to get people to ignore scientific teachings. I would recommend origin of species to anyone, but not this altered version with 50 pages of falsehood and misleading crap hanging on the front. People should choose religion only if they believe it's right for them; not if they've been lied to and misled into believing it, being human is all about making choices. But that's certainly not what Comfort thinks.
B000024D4R|5.0|Is it Pink Floyd's best album? What do I know? Does it feature Pink Floyd at its rawest rocking peak? Absolutely. My favorite PF album without question (and I say this with all biasness having been released on my 20th birthday 1977 compelling my roomies and me to race down to the U of I Champaign record store for first dibs). The album for me retains its freshness better than the others (although the freshness date for their `71 to '79 stretch of work will never expire). For the life of me I do not know how Pigs TDO is left off of the PF greatest hits releases. Memories of the PF Soldier Field Chicago show I attended in June '77 remain vivid as well. Imagine Animals and WYWH back to back live. Hey you Whitehouse, charade you are....

B0029NY9YO|5.0|I went to see The Watchmen this weekend because it was about the only new thing to see. It is a movie adaptation of a seminal work that has been purported to have raised the genre of the mere comic book to that of the graphic novel. It turned out to be a rather enjoyable film in spite of its gruesome aspects.<br /><br />The Watchmen takes place in an alternate universe in 1985 with Richard Nixon now serving his fifth term as president. Do we detect some major liberal angst generated by the Reagan years? The background is the ever present threat of a U.S.-Soviet nuclear war. However, the U.S. has a deterrent more powerful that a MX missile with 10 Mk-21 warheads: We have Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup)! The Doctor is a blue fuzzy apparition of a physicist who was transformed into super-being by an experiment gone wild.<br /><br />The background story attempts to show a world in which superheroes exit. The Watchmen have been around since 1940 fighting crime and doing a few other things too. The U.S. wins the Vietnam War after Nixon persuades the Watchmen to intervene as one notable example. I guess this is how he was able to get the 22 Amendment repealed and be elected for another three terms? Naturally, Henry Kissinger is still at his side.<br /><br />The action starts with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), one of the more notorious Watchmen. Now who was that on the \\"grassy knoll\\" in the Kennedy assassination scene anyway? Rorschach (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) immediately suspects that someone is out to kill off the Watchmen and that The Comedian is just the first. As we follow his effort to warn the others, we meet the rest of the team: The Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Oyzmandias (Matthew Goode), Dr. Manhattan, and his girlfriend Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). The government, i.e. Nixon, has banned masked crime fighters like the Watchmen. But, it still relies on Dr. Manhattan to keep us safe from the Soviet nuclear threat. Then he doesn't wear a mask and in fact usually doesn't wear clothes either!<br /><br />Rorschach has one of the strangest superhero masks ever. It is a continually changing \\"ink blot\\" pattern, hence his name. If you would guess from this that he is a crazy [characterization deleted] then you'd be correct! He repeatedly flies into fits of psychotic rage killing those (mostly villains) he thinks deserve it. He has a complete disdain for what he calls \\"liberal sensitivities\\".<br /><br />Oyzmandias has the super skill of being the smartest man in the world. He has reasoned that the primary risk of war is the struggle over energy resources. Therefore, he has set out to develop a limitless source of energy. Silk Spectre II aka Laurie Jupiter meanwhile finds it impossible to like up her mothers, Silk Spectre aka Sally Jupiter's (Carla Gugino), reputation.<br /><br />The action takes a major turn when Dr. Manhattan's girlfriend, Silk Spectre II, breaks up with him and develops a relationship with Nite Owl II. The jilted Dr. Manhattan loses his sense of purpose and leaves for Mars to wallow in self-pity. This of course causes a radical shift in the U.S.-Soviet strategic balance. Before long Nixon and Kissinger are planning a preemptive attack on the Soviets as they fear the Soviet are planning an attack on the U.S.<br /><br />This film is a fun political nostalgia trip and a great satire of the whole superhero concept. Such treats as snippets of the McLaughlin Group debating the impact of Dr. Manhattan on the strategic balance as just one example. If one can get past the graphic violence and some sexuality, Watchmen provides a lot of laughs for those familiar with the reference points or the original work. It is definitely not for children.

But really, comparisons aren't fair.<br /><br />These guys have done what Rodriquez and Gabriella have done:  Gone back to basics with something utterly new and (most importantly) exciting!<br /><br />WHEN was the last time YOU got excited hearing music?

B0026P3G12|5.0|I am so happy she got to make an album.  The media should be ashamed of themselves for the stories they had on the air when she was in that contest, if they had looked at all of the positive, instead of trying to dig up dirt, she would have won, I just wonder how many of the news people would be where they are at today, if someone had tried to destroy them when they were getting their start?
B000EQHHJW|5.0|Real opera lovers are a wee tad finicky, as the one- and two-star reviews of this DVD demonstrate. Real opera lovers seem to have a Platonic Ideal of the opera in their cavernous consciousnesses, a template of what Joe Verdi intended, from which any deviation is risky. Real opera lovers don't take well to 'film' productions of their idolized operas. Even if they are now ultra-pecunious enough to sit in the orchestra, they recall their youthful evenings in 'paradise' (the highest balcony) as the best of their lives, and they need that distant, almost inaudible timbre in the tenor's voice to sustain their enthusiasm. Real opera lovers KNOW whose performance, attested only by repute or perhaps by a tinny recording, was sans pareil for all time.<br /><br />Me? I'm just a guy who goes to the opera for the fun of it, and I'm ready to be pleased. I'm also a musician by trade, which leads me to cut quite a lot of slack for the professional sisters and brothers, and inclines me to care more about the sounds I hear, the music itself, than about the staging or acting. Yes yes, I know opera as an art aspires to totality, to the sublime unison of drama and music. But realistically, friends, the unison is most often imbalanced: wonderful music, dopey libretto. Can you earnestly argue otherwise? Particularly about the operas of Giuseppe Verdi?<br /><br />Case in point: Rigoletto! The script is a squalid and improbable melodrama. Without music, it would be snored off the stage. Rigoletto is a horrid little beast, deformed as much in mind as in body, and he's more convincingly gullible than devious. The Duke of Mantua is an odious tyrant. Everyone in the cast is besotted with evil except Gilda, Rigoletto's cloistered daughter, whose purity of being must be taken on faith. The story is grotesque, the characters are grotesque... but the music! ah, the music is celestial! Even the vile assassin is given celestial music to sing. But does any real opera lover ever complain about 'cognitive dissonance'?<br /><br />I can almost promise you, dear reader, that even if you think you've never seen or heard Rigoletto in your life, you will snap to attention at the Duke's first major aria, and say to yourself \\"why, I know that music! So this is where it comes from!\\" And you'll have such epiphanies several more times before the final curtain. It's the Duke's voice you'll remember as you leave the theater, or turn off the DVD player. It's the joyous lilt of the debauched Duke's arias that you'll find yourself singing in the shower. The most essential item in a production of Rigoletto is that the Duke's role be sung superbly, and recorded equally well. Forget any other quibbles: Luciano Pavarotti sang this music, as people said about Caruso, like a God. If you've ever wondered why Pavarotti was venerated, this DVD will answer your doubts. You can decide for yourself whether he could also 'act'. It's an insignificant question.<br /><br />Ingvar Wixell is almost ludicrously ugly in his make-up as the hunch-backed Rigoletto, and his posturing verges on silliness, but once again, IT'S The Music, Stupid! Wixell's tormented, interiorized vocal art makes emotional sense out of Verdi's twisted musical musings. If the visuals annoy you, opera lovers, just shade your eyes and watch the subtitles.<br /><br />Coloratura soprano Edita Gruberova  soars. That's her job. She doesn't look childish enough for the role, but she conveys her nun-like innocence in her voice, and she sings in tune! Not a minor accomplishment for a Verdi specialist! What's more, she has the musical wisdom to \\"comp\\" to Pavarotti in their duets, not to attempt to upstage him. Nobody could upstage Pavarotti in this music.<br /><br />Okay. I'm almost finished.<br /><br />Verdi outdid himself in Rigoletto. The music is iconic. Unforgettable. Rigoletto is one warhorse that deserves to be ridden as long as opera houses stand and opera lovers are willing to spend an Afghani's life wages for a single eveningin a box seat.
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|I liked the first 2 installments of Ice Age.  Hope the third one doesn't run out of steam because the filmmakers pushed it too far.  I say hope because I haven't seen the third one yet.  I own it but cannot watch it.  All the special features and the menus are fine but the audio for the feature film is all distorted.  I checked my player settings and all connections and played other BD titles and no problems with them, just with IA3.  SO I take the disc back to Best Buy and get a replacement and same problem which leads me to believe that it was a production run glitch for that particular batch and that no matter how many times I get it replaced from that store, the same problem will repeat itself.  I found a customer service number for FOX that I will try tomorrow when they open and see what I can find out there.  I'll post my findings if they come to any fruition.    Just putting this out there to see if others have gotten defective copies as well.  This is the first BD that I have had problems with as far as defects go.  Then there's the problem of when the studios use inferior film elements for their BD releases.  Can anyone say 2010: The Year We Make Contact?  It's a travesty that it was released on BD what with many sequences being so grainy, you think you're watching it through a thin layer of sand.  But 'nuff said 'bout that title.    Thanks for reading and please, if you've experienced this problem with Ice Age 3 on BD, please comment on this post and let me know.    Peace.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Porco Rosso is about an Italian World War I flying ace who is now working as a freelance bounty hunter.  Somewhere along the line, he was cursed and transformed into a pig; however, the film never explains how he got the curse.  Originally known as Marco Pagot, he is now known as Porco Rosso (which is Italian for \\"Red Pig\\").  Porco hunts down seaplane pirates in the Adriatic Sea.  Even though Porco is rivals with the pirates, they can coexist with a minimal amount of bloodshed.  During the course of the film, we meet his friend Gina, rival Curtis, and Fio (a 17-year-old aircraft designer).<br /><br />The animation and storytelling are strong points for Porco Rosso.  However, I think the pacing of the story may be too slow for younger children to enjoy.  Personally, I think this film will appeal to anime viewers who are nine or ten years of age and older.<br /><br />Just like Disney's other Studio Ghibli releases, Porco Rosso was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contains the film and most of the special features.  The first special feature is a roughly seven minute long documentary titled, \\"Behind the Microphone.\\"  During the documentary, you see some of the voice actors recording the English dialogue for the dub version of the film.  There are also interviews with some of the English dub actors (Susan Egan, Cary Elwes, Michael Keaton, David Ogden Stiers, Brad Garrett, and Kimberly Williams-Paisley).  It's a decent documentary for what it is.<br /><br />Next is a three-and-a-half minute interview with Toshio Suzuki, the Japanese producer for Porco Rosso.  The audio is in Japanese, and English subtitles are provided.  Then, there are the original Japanese trailers and TV spots for the film.  This feature runs for about eight minutes, and it has Japanese audio with some English subtitles.  The spots are in one continuous piece; there is no way to select which ones you want to see.  The final menu option in the special features menu allows you to register the DVD.<br /><br />All that is on the second disc of Porco Rosso is a storyboard version of the film; basically, it's the movie, expect it only utilizes storyboards and none of the actual animation.  Just like with Disney's other Studio Ghibli releases, I just don't understand releasing a storyboard version of the film on a second disc.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's films, then you should see Porco Rosso.  Even with the unnecessary second disc, this is a DVD that should be in the collection of any anime fan.the second disc of Porco Rosso is a storyboard version of the film; basically, it's the movie, expect it only utilizes storyboards and none of the actual animation.

0307266303|5.0|This book reads like a novel, it is entertaining and inspirational.  If you are a runner that is struggling to find the real joy in running it may go a long way in getting you there.  If you are not a runner, I can't imagine reading this book and not wanting to put on your running shoes - or stepping out for your first barefoot run.  This book has done more than the policticians have done to stimulate the countries economy.  I bought and am using Chia seeds, as is everyone I know who has read the book and I also bought a pair of Vibram 5-fingers.  While I have yet to run in them I do love to use them for workouts.  In conclusion the book stimutlated joy, inspiration, and the economy.  It is one of those books you are disappointed to finish and find yourself missing it.
160094048X|4.0|This book is a great resource for vegan cookies. Cookies! That are vegan! That's awesome. And there are very cool, original, and delicious ingredient combinations. The sweet wine cookies with sesame seeds are awesome! The Mexican hot chocolate cookies are awesome! The pine nut cookies are awesome! The photographs in this book are mouth-wateringly awesome! And another exciting aspect is that it's perfectly doable to get cookies looking as beautiful as the ones in the pictures.     A big plus for me in this book is the successful balance of ingredients you already have in your pantry, ingredients you can get at a regular grocery store, fun ingredients for treats and parties (like different sugars, flours, extracts, wines, seeds, etc.) and expensive ingredients for an even more special treat.     What bugs me is that the cookies don't actually taste that amazing. It's not always worth it to get those special ingredients to use on these. A huge part of it for me is that almost all of these call for canola oil where a non-vegan recipe would call for butter and/or shortening. Canola oil by itself just doesn't taste nearly as good as earth balance! If you're worried about cookies tasting too \\"vegan\\" and basically too much like earth balance / margarine instead of butter to nonvegans, use half earth balance, half oil, or half earth balance, half 100% vegetable shortening (unflavored, I mean, unlike the earth balance) or whatever. And as an experienced vegan baker, my cookies usually only taste \\"too vegan\\" to grumpy non-vegans eating shortbread (AKA butter) cookies, in which earth balance is the main ingredient. If there's chocolate or peanut butter or another strong flavor, the earth balance will just taste rich and flaky.      I'm sure that many people will appreciate that the oil makes these cookies healthier or lower in fat or whatever. I personally want a gourmet vegan cookie book to make delicious, rich, decadent cookies, not to be healthy! I would have appreciated a better balance of these goals.     Overall, definitely worth it. If you're as bothered as I am by the canola oil, it's not a big deal to switch it out for earth balance (though I would've appreciate that being in the book itself). The recipes are fun and there's something for every skill level.     Also, this book is WAY better than the Joy of Vegan Baking.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|At first I was skeptical about the movie because it was sooo predictable. Everyone and their grandma knew these two would somehow get together. What was entertaining to see was HOW they ended up together. I was always curious to see who would \\"give in\\" first. If you iike Romanic Comdey, you will enjoy this.

B002GZQY6Q|2.0|I have been a big PT fan for several years but now they are (more rightly than wrongly) consistently listed among the \\"metal\\" bands which for me means they are on a path I don't enjoy.

6304981635|5.0|Enter the Dragon was purchased because I have been a huge Bruce Lee fan since age 16, when he blew me away in 1973, ironically, I came to love and admire him only months before his death in July of 1973. I can recite most of the lines from the movie by memory, having seen it from start to finish 100s and 100s of times, I've lost count. Never in my wildest imagination would I think that one day I would be able to own my very own copy of this fantastic, action packed feature of the \\"Little Dragon\\"..Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon. I also purchased the soundtrack from the movie, and had numerous posters of my kung-fu hero. Anyone who compares Bruce Lee with today's action-stars e.g. Jackie Chan, Jet Li etc, is comparing apples to oranges..not even close. Although I do so admire these stars, they just aren't comparable to Bruce Lee, He stands alone, and always will. I will never get tired of watching Enter the Dragon to this day now at age 50+, best of the best.
B0029O08WA|5.0|When I first bought this I was disappointed, thinking I just wasted 10 dollars. i saw new moon in theaters, LOVED IT!!!   I heard the music as I was watching the movie...it just went perfectly with the emotions..I think alot of us were expecting the mysterious/upbeat rock on the twilight soundtrack.  But The emotion in new moon is different, more sad/complex, and if you listen to new moon soundtrack, thinking of the emotion Bella, and Edward was feeling, you will realize the songs describes what their feelings very well.  I now enjoy listening to the soundtrack..its calming, and the songs themselves are done very well!

B002QGUFWE|5.0|I was so excited when I finally got this CD in the mail. I was ready to hear all of Gaga's new songs. While listening to the first track, \\"Bad Romance\\", I noticed that it was edited. I was very mad about it. I got on Amazon to see if I had accidently ordered the edited version and realized that everyone was complaining about this issue. I then called Amazon filing a complaint. If an album is edited, then it should be advertised as edited. They are giving a full refund. I will just send the CD back and wait for the explicit version to be released. There's nothing I hate more than hearing little skips in music due to censorship of profane words. Other than the censorship issue, the music is amazing on The Fame Monster. I can't wait for the explicit version to be released.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I must confess to admiring the sheer stick-to-it guts of Susan Boyle and I'd have bought this anyway just to help her say \\"nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!\\" to all the those who judged her less than they, even though she had ten times the courage and I dare say more talent.    she's a caregiver. she stayed home and looked after her aged parents until they died. you try that, if you think it's so easy. that alone would make her my hero. but she also has that voice, that soaring grab-your-heart voice that saved her spirit all those years.    Now it's her turn, and  what a joy to hear the songs on this. She brings all her vocal talents and her heart to this very wide range of songs. I understand she may not be a Pavarotti but she's a gutsy talented gal who knows how to throw her songs at your heart.    And this is music to my ears and a great feeling in my heart. Susan. you GO girl!
B002OFWG7E|4.0|Who would have thought that Dave Grohl -- the man who once provided a backbeat to Kurt Cobain's pain -- would go so long and so far with his pet project, the Foo Fighters? For the last decade and a half, Grohl and his co-horts have consistently delivered a staggering amount of hit singles, solid albums and often hilarious music videos. As a band who has presented itself with little hype or pretention, it should come as no surprise that they have become the underdogs, almost the unsung heroes of 90's alternative rock. While their time has yet to come to an end, their first Greatest Hits collection is a brief yet substantial celebration of a career well spent.<br /><br />As with any greatest hits package, this one delivers pretty much what one would expect with a few gripes here and there. While the band's most noteworthy material like \\"Everlong\\" and \\"Times Like These\\" pops up, this collection is no doubt missing a few major singles and even some fan favorites. The exclusion of \\"Walking After You\\" and one of the band's earliest hits, \\"I'll Stick Around\\" is downright criminal, especially considering that the length of this CD doesn't even use up all of the space it could! Likewise, \\"DOA,\\" and \\"Next Year\\" are conspicuously absent, as well as the elusive cover of Prince's \\"Darling Nikki,\\" which received significant airplay back in 2004. Any of these songs could have fit the package, with room to spare.<br /><br />On the upside, though, the set boasts two new studio tracks as well as a most excellent acoustic rendition of \\"Everlong\\" (which made an appearance in the Adam Sandler flick, [[ASIN:B00003CXPS Little Nicky]], but not on its soundtrack). \\"Wheels\\" is the single, meant to promote the album, and it's a perfect example of how this band has grown in leaps and bounds over the years, but still maintains its identity. The other new track, \\"Word Forward,\\" sounds like it could have been on the [[ASIN:B000UFAURI Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]] album and fit in rather nicely. These three tracks no doubt make this collection worth buying for those who aren't just casual fans or passersby who may enjoy a song here and there.<br /><br />The cream of the crop, however, is the DVD that is included.<br /><br />*** What?

B002UXRH10|5.0|This is a complete different Rihanna album, reason being she's more darker and edgier in her lyrics. It definitely sets the tone for the entire album that she's just not a little pop girl singing about bubble and high heels. Some fans may not understand what she's trying to go for but you can tell she's done it her own way and did it good !   I'm choosing my 5 Favorite tracks even though I love the whole damn thing ! !!    1. Russian Roulette  2. Fire Bomb  3. HARD  4. Wait Your Turn  5. TE AMO    ITs A must for everyone who wants to hear something different from her and by far one of the best albums of the year !
0307454541|4.0|There are many \\"thriller\\" novels on the market today that are great only in their first read.  The nature of the genre is tied to suspense and in that, much is often lost in the knowledge of how the story ends.  I loved Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code the first time I read them both.  After trying to re-read them, the luster was gone and they did not hold up well at all.  This is where Mr. Larsson's novel excels.  As I generally have to re-read books to actually remember them, this held my attention to the end the second time through.<br /><br />Translated very well from the original Swedish by Reg Keeland, this book moves very quickly.  The interaction of the unlikely duo of journalist-turned-outcast Mikeal Blomkvist and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander was clever and interesting.  The ancillary characters were rich and were a pleasure to read.  My only concern about this book is some of the techno-babble may be a bit much for those who do not use or are not familiar with computers.  Some of said babble dates the book as the impressive computer specifications in 2003 are not all that impressive today.  Overall, if one can gather that the technology referenced is the best and most innovative of the time, it can be overlooked.<br /><br />Mystery stories are often peppered with clich&eacute; and over-the-top characters; I believe that this story does well in that the characters are generally believable.  The settings are rich and the descriptions of people and place are detailed without being overdone.<br /><br />It is very hard to describe much of the book without giving it away, so I will end by simply saying: If you enjoy thrillers or mysteries, this is a good book to have on the shelf.<br /><br />epc

B001N18HOG|5.0|Years ago I reviewed the original \\"Ten\\" album.  It was a great record in 1991 and it was still exceptional in 2002 when I first reviewed it.  The only complaint I have about the original piece is something is lost in the production.  I could never put my finger on why I would still listen to the songs from the record, but only when they were played live in the many \\"official bootlegs\\" released by the band.  I then read a review that said something along the line of \\"studio effects that were applied to give a stadium feel were more 80's than 90's\\" and it hit me as finally someone had put to words my only problem with this piece of rock history.      The new versions, re-arranged and produced by long-time Pearl Jam producer Brendan O'Brian are cleaner and sharper than the originals.  You can make out more of what is being said.  I know that this is a challenge, especially in the world of Pearl Jam.  The feel overall is more like the rawness that is captured throughout the rest of the discography.  So much of the processing effects added in the post-production phase are gone and we are left with a more living version of the original.  Put this disc in the player and you feel what it would have sounded like sitting in the booth those days with the band. . .    To me, this is what this should have been all along.  This is not to give the impression that the original was not great, and in line with the production standards of the time, but it takes some of the polish off that left a mildly muddy feel.  I think now, after nearly 20 years, the record is complete.    epc
B00000DG1R|4.0|This disc covers most of Duran Duran's biggest hits, many of which I have been hearing on the radio for years.  Most are from the early 80's, including songs from the album \\"Rio\\".  There are a couple of songs I think are overrated, including \\"A View to a Kill\\".  However the others are great, and \\"Come Undone\\" along with \\"Ordinary World\\" are beautiful songs they released in 1993.  Hardcore fans would probably own all of the albums but I'm happy with this album (for now).  It includes most songs you would want in a single disc, but if you're into B-sides and other rarities you're out of luck.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This movie has some heavy doses of weirdness that make it hard for me to digest, but \\"Dug\\" the-talking-dog really grows on me.  He makes me laugh out loud and love him at the same time.  There is a strong life lesson at the end of this movie about the value of committed relationships adding more to life than achieving shared life goals.  After seeing it the first time by renting it, I purchased the Deluxe 2-disk addition - not because I wanted the digital copy but because the special features are really great and you can't get them on the single disk DVD.  Yes! See it! Enjoy it - in-spite of some heavy doses of weirdness. :-)
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|The problem that I had with her debut album (The Fame) was that one half of the album felt a lot better than the other. Although still good, the tracks between the hit singles felt a little bit like filler.    I find no such issues with her sophomore album. All the songs on the album really shine, and genuinely feel like potential hits. As well as having catchy lyrics and excellent production, the themes in the songs are more personal. I felt that the last two tracks on The Fame Monster were the weakest, although they may grow on me like Bad Romance did. The only real critism I can level at the album is that is has the length of an EP. Which means its over far too quickly ;)    How much I enjoyed each of the songs on The Fame Monster:    1.

B001EYGOEM|1.0|Taylor's vocals are so pitchy and off key on most of this album that you almost forget to pay attention to the lyrics. For someone who is supposed to be such a great songwriter, I am not impressed. Her songwriting is bubble gum pop teen rubbish...and it is essentially clique and unoriginal too. She is one of the worst vocalists in country music or any genre for that matter. How she wins so many awards is a mystery...I think people forget to examine the big fat elephant in the room: her terrible live singing and pop-remixing. She is about as country as Snoop Dog.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am not surprised at some of the negative reviews. I suppose for die-hard Trekkies there are things that would upset them. However, I consider myself a moderate Trekkie and I loved this movie. The effects are awesome, the cast was great and the story was interesting. Sure, they changed the Star Trek universe time-line. They had to refresh the series. Anyone who truly knows how time-travel (in the Star Trek world) works knows this is hardly a big deal.<br />The new Star Trek timeline opens up a new pathway for the series and makes it new and refreshing. They would hardly have done well to just remake what we've already seen.<br />There are a few things in this new movie that bothered me, like Spock and Uhura hooking up. The other things are kind of hard to describe, but none of these things detracted (at least for me) from an exciting movie that I hope brings a whole new generation of people to a wonderful franchise as well as future awesome movies.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Here's the deal; David Lynch is an acquired taste, so much so that many, many people will never acquire the taste needed to appreciate him.  The best thing about Lynch is the fact that he doesn't care.  From the very beginning, with his BRILLIANT debut film `Eraserhed', Lynch proved that he has a unique visionary style and point of view that he is not willing to bend or compromise just to receive commercial success.  `Mulholland Drive' is about as unconventional a film as you can get, and because of that many people are scared of it or turned off by its complexity.<br /><br />Don't be afraid.<br /><br />What I admire about Lynch is that he is very willing to use his talent to make a statement, no matter how bold it may be.  In `Mulholland Drive', Lynch makes many statements and layers them with enough mystery to keep the audience baffled from beginning to end, which only adds to the importance of a film like this.  It will keep you guessing, which will keep you talking, which will keep you interested.<br /><br />Some have claimed this to be boring.  I think they need to watch it again.<br /><br />Part of me is chomping at the bit to get into just what this film `means', but I really fear that someone who has yet to experience this film will find my rambling to divulging and may in turn feel the need to watch this film null and void.  There is so much to say about this film but what can you say without giving away too much of the experience.<br /><br />The film has been dissected numerous times on this site.<br /><br />The basic plot is this:<br /><br />Betty is a young and beautiful aspiring actress who moves to Hollywood and is currently staying in her Aunts home while she is away.  After a car accident (portrayed in the films open) a young and beautiful woman named Rita shows up, cursed with amnesia, and Betty decides that she is going to help Rita regain her memory.  Rita only remembers two things, `Diane' and `Mulholland Drive'.<br /><br />Unlocking those secrets is going to take you places you never imagined.<br /><br />I idea of mirrored dreams is very prominent in this film, for everything you think you see is a stark contrast to the realities the final 30 minutes unveil to us.  Exact scenarios and situations appear reversed as Diane's identity is revealed and her life is examined for us.  What we are left with is a harrowing discovery that may leave questions unanswered for the `first time viewer', but those questions are easily answered upon repeat viewings.  This is a film that really demands your time in order to appreciate it.  Lynch feels that it must be seen in one viewing, not paused or stopped for any reason, and I concur, for taking yourself away from the film for merely a moment can cause you to leave the world Lynch is drenching you in.  There is a moment, in the film, where a woman sings the song `Crying' and that moment is really the crux for the entire film, explaining so much while seemingly saying so little.<br /><br />When you watch the film for a second time it will make so much more sense, I promise.<br /><br />But, truth be told, it is the mystery that makes this film so startling.  The interpretations of this film and the personal feelings towards Diane's predicament really play heavily into how much you will or won't accept the film.  Your love and hate will depend entirely on your willingness to explore the many twists and turns presented in this film.  If you like your entertainment quick and easy then stay away, but if you enjoy taking a film apart, frame for frame, in order to uncover tiny trinkets of deeper meaning then this film will fascinate you.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Naomi Watts is a revelation here, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise!of mirrored dreams is very prominent in this film, for everything you think you see is a stark contrast to the realities the final 30 minutes unveil to us.

Of their releases there is only one that I cannot stand (`Cars') but there are quite a few I consider absolutely wonderful (`Ratatouille', `The Incredibles') and one that I consider a near masterpiece (`Finding Nemo').  In my personal opinion, `Up' is the best thing they have ever done.  It is, quite frankly, a modern masterpiece in animated filmmaking.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple on the outset.  Carl Fredricksen (who looks an awful lot like Spencer Tracy) is a crotchety old widower who is holding onto the only memory he has of his departed wife; their home and a dream of adventure.  When circumstances shift, paving the way for Carl to be court ordered to a nursing home, he decides to try his hand at adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his roof and going up, up, up and away.  With a young stowaway named Russell, an overweight boy-scout of sorts, Carl sets off in hot pursuit of Paradise Falls, the land he and his beloved wife always dreamed of exploring.<br /><br />Let's get one thing straight; this is a story about a floating house, so don't expect it to be realistic.  To those who pick apart plot holes such as \\"where was Russell's mother this whole time\\" and the like, sure it isn't realistic, but are you really expecting it to be?<br /><br />One thing I will agree on is that this is a very sad and dramatic film that may not be suitable for all children.  I do feel that it may be good for children who face similar situations as Russell to see their home life displayed in a sweetly appealing setting like the one presented in this animated film, but I do also feel that some subjects discussed may be too deep or even unsettling at times for young ones.  It was choking me up.  Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to themes such as the inability to have children (or it possibly could have been a miscarriage) and the death of a spouse.  Themes such as single parent families and neglect come into play as well, and the ending, which is sweet, is also laced with sadness.<br /><br />The film will make you smile and laugh, but it will make you cry A LOT.<br /><br />With that solitary caution (it does tend to get very violent towards the end as well, and with attacks made on a child I find that it may be a concern to a parent) I have to say that this is a very, very, very good movie; great even.  No, better than great; it is a MASTERPIECE.  The animation is stellar, the concept is original and engaging, the humor is strong and the gags are all on point, fresh and welcome.  For me, it was nice to see such strong emotional themes explored in this context.  It adds a different layer to the general consensus of dramatic entertainment.  Sure, this is no where near as gritty or as overwhelming as `Grave of the Fireflies', but `Up' allows the humor to play a perfect balance to the mature point of view this film is taking.<br /><br />There are very few animated films that can handle both sides of the spectrum with such grace and eloquence.well, and the ending, which is sweet, is also laced with sadness.

B002T45VX6|2.0|Shakira used to be interesting... her lyrics used to be interesting and at times odd, but you knew there was something intriguing about this lady. Unfortunately, she's trying too hard to be liked these days. She's sacrificing artistic integrity for the benefit of having better sales in the USA. But I ask myself... Will she have good sales at all? I think not, I actually think her album won't perform very good in the USA or anywhere for that matter. It debuted in the UK @ # 4 and has been falling ever since. \\"She-Wolf\\" (the song) is not only strange in every sense, but just confusing and as a friend of mine would call it - \\"pornopop\\"... As for the other 2 \\"big\\" songs of the album, \\"Give It Up To Me\\" and \\"Did It Again\\", ugh there's no inspiration in them at all... same dance moves and same lack of creativity... How far will she go in selling out? Despite those good reviews in the press, I recommend not buying it. Stick to the early Shakira.. this is not evolution at all.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|(1.) Too many producers (appropriately including Bad Robot Productions) - a list as long as the cast which resulted in a jumbled incoherent patchwork of scenes and subplots. As for acting and dialogue it was like watching cartoon characters.  (2.) Excessive, overbearing computer generated and orchestrated high school band music and the usual choir to create suspense and drama. A tipoff to poor story writing, acting and visuals. And action such as the usual (and they did this at least twice) people nearly falling off of a precipice while dangling by fingers. Of course, they survive.  (3.) The reliance on tattoos and cheap halloween manufactured latex suits to create aliens was laughable and indicative of the quality of intent from the many producers.  (4.) Reliance on standard \\"let's create an alien feel\\" props such as the now boring (and ripped off) ice fields & cave; lobster and bear like creatures (a cheap one minute, thank goodness); cities that look like the fantasy cartoon work being produced by illustrators during the '80s. Anything to look weird but structurally -  zero sense.   (4.) Amongst the worst science I've ever seen and they had science advisors (they must be art majors w/teaching certs. that ended up teaching middle school science) e.g. the typical rusty heavy steel industrial look which is a 20th century technology that cannot be used in space travel especially in 300 years. Makes zero sense especially if you're trying to accelerate useless mass to those velocities; speaking of acc/decelerations what I saw in the movie would crush every living and nonliving thing within the Enterprise and it as well. Supernovas occur every day in our galaxy so no big deal despite what was said in the movie that the galaxy would be destroyed by one and by the way there are 100 billion stars in ours. It's like saying a grain of sand could suddenly annihilate Earth. Swords - give me a break. And, red oil, from a lava lamp no less, to destroy a planet!! What more can Isay!! The type of time travel shown besides being physically impossible at that scale is also not possible by any mathematical physics imaginable. Sound and explosions in a vacuum! I thought we got away from that stuff decades ago.   (5.) Cheap props such as obvious models for ships and buildings; cheap CG such as the cliffs at the beginning of the movie that looked like a 2D rendering. And why would an immaculate million+ dollar  'vette (that's the value now so imagine what it would be in a hundred years assuming it hadn't rusted) be roaming desert roads?   (6.) So a story about life in a vacuum turns out to be vacuous.
0307454541|2.0|Looking at all the rave reviews online by both customers and professional reviewers, I feel like I somehow missed the boat.  Only the NY Times review made me feel that I wasn't alone in my dislike for this book, even though when I started I had very high hopes and wanted to like it.<br /><br />A lot of people have already outlined the plot, so I won't go into it here especially since it's rather complex in and of itself.<br /><br />Personally, what set me off at first from the book is the writing style.  It is how one would write an article for a newspaper, magazine, etc.; succeint and to the point.  Which of course makes sense looking at the fact that the late author was a reporter.  But what feels wrong to me is the fact that he spends so much time telling.  Everytime I started to get an image in my mind about what a house, village, person looked like, it could never fully form because I was essentially being told the basic outline and that's all.  This writing style is not immersive to me, nor were the parts where plot advancements/clues are literally bashed over the readers head just in case we really are as obtuse as Herr Larsson seems to suspect.<br /><br />I found both lead characters rather stiff and lacking any sort of defining personality.  Mikael Blomkvist, the male lead, apparently is so hot that every women wants to have sex with him and a vast majority end up loving him.  He has been a serial adulter for over twenty years with one woman, losing his own marriage to this affair and also takes on other women on the side.  He really seems to have no regard for any of his sexual partners and believes that sex is merely a recreation and its your fault if you even dare suggest it be thought of as something more.  Several times in the novel he makes incredibly dumb desicions and at the climax of the main mystery he makes one of the stupidest mistakes, something so brazenly foolish that you wonder if he was given any brains at all.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, the female lead is a little more sympathic but Larsson seems focused on making every bad thing in world that is possible happen to her.  This is a spoiler, but seeing that it has been mentioned all throughout the reviews here I'll go ahead: there is a graphic rape scene regarding her.  While, supposedly, the rapist returns in the second book, it still seems completely out of place and unnecessary. It does nothing to further the plot/story whatsoever.  To make matters worse the whole sequence reads like a revenge fantasy rather then what would actually happen to a 24 year old, emotionally impaired woman who was sadistically raped.<br /><br />These three things mixed together - the writing style, and the two main characters - made for a very subpar reading experience for me.  I so wanted to like this book, I thought the plot sounded intense and like a breath of fresh air.  Instead, as the centeral mystery wound to it's conclusion, things just got out of control and exited the realm of what could be believed and instead seemed to be used more for shock value.<br /><br />For those that are worried about reading a translated book, don't be.  Yes there are a couple of translator errors and a couple of sentences that aren't just clunky in English but actually don't make sense unless you reorder the words.  Other then these small problems though, it's pretty smooth.  As someone who has done translation work before, it's hard to be 100% perfect and this is definitely one of the better translations that I've read.re sympathic but Larsson seems focused on making every bad thing in world that is possible happen to her.

1594202249|5.0|I am perhaps the odd person here in that I'd never gotten around to reading Pynchon until Inherent Vice. So, I can't say much about how it relates to the rest of his canon. That's a canon, though, that I soon hope to explore after reading this novel. Having finished it and digested it for about a week, I've come to the conclusion that Inherent Vice is just a startling book, one of the best novels I've read in years.    There's so much to say about it, but I'll just highlight two key reasons for why I loved it. First, it is a fun read. A lot of reviewers have described Inherent Vice as a beach read because of its ubiquitous humor, the vibrant rhythm of the dialogue and storytelling, the nostalgic feel of 1960s California, a likeable and mysterious central character (Doc), and a loose but amusing plot centered around a hippy detective's quest to solve a case (that's not even the case he starts out investigating). It does possess all of those aspects. That said, I wouldn't call it a beach read. I'd think you might call it a beach read if you've only been reading Pynchon's previous novels and the like. But the novel's too philosophical, it frustrates the conventions of the detective genre too much, and its plot is hardly coherent and easily grasped--it's just not a beach read. But all of those entertaining qualities are still present. What it is is a fun *and* literary read. I just think people are a little shocked at those two qualities being combined for once.    Second, the more I think about the novel, the more I think that it has a sad and beautiful thematic center. One aspect of the plot concerns the character Coy Harlingen and his family. Coy and his wife Hope had been heroine addicts unable to keep from destroying their own lives and the life of their daughter Amethyst. I won't give away any details, but Coy has been estranged from the family (in a way that helped Hope to get clean and set up a more solid livelihood for Amethyst), leaving them saddened with onlysome pictures to remember him by. At some point, Doc thinks of Amethyst and thinks that she \\"deserves something more than faded polaroids to go to when she gets the little-kid blues.\\" Doc sets out to find Coy.    I think that image sums up a lot of what's going on in the novel. There's a hard hitting critique of our late capitalist American culture that we have traded the image for the thing. Somehow, we've lost our ability to connect to the world (it's a shifting, decaying natural world in the novel), to others, and to our most natural desires. We've lost sense of the real. And so we face a future in which authentic livelihoods can barely be remembered and can hardly be accessed... The novel attempts to articulate something of that loss and to look for a way out of the fog...    It's a fun read. But don't think it's just a fun read.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My grandson LOVES this film so much he wore out his first CD.  This is the replacement.      I love it, too.  The love story is endearing, especially with the wonderful music we don't get to hear very often. The background subjects, subtly shown in comedy, of super-sized meals, too much garbage and no exercise are things we should all address.      Definitely a great movie for all ages.

B001FB4W0W|2.0|The Present: After a Japanese corporation announces that it has perfected a synthetic blood substitute for use in emergency trauma surgery, the world is stunned by the revelation of the existence of Vampires who have decided to \\"come out of the coffin\\" and make their presence known to human society. Now that the synthetic blood (which is bottled like a beverage and sold as \\"Tru Blood\\") has eradicated the Vampires' need to feed on human prey, they are seeking the same recognition, rights and privileges as their human counterparts. Unsurprisingly, these fanged interlopers are treated with suspicion and fear - and nowhere more so than in the small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, where the arrival of the town's first resident Vampire coincides with a spate of murders...    HBO's \\"True Blood\\" had the potential to be one of the most intriguing takes on Vampire mythology ever to make it to the small screen, but unfortunately the only accolade it can really claim is that of being distinctly average. The whole thing is really no more than a winsome Vampire romance dressed up as ham-fisted social commentary. I'll be honest, I only made it through five episodes of season one due to the fact that it was so completely derivative and clichéd. What could have been a fascinating examination of cross-cultural miscegenation (or not) between two mutually suspicious species was eschewed in favour of the usual knuckle-bitingly tedious post Anne Rice/Buffy/Twilight tropes of Vampire bars; Vampire elders dressed like Goths; pale, ambiguously seductive bad boys and crass dream sequences featuring our heroine being ravished in her silky nightie.     None of it is remotely original and while plentiful nudity and profanity may be revelatory to any fifteen year olds who are watching, to me it just felt like a cheap tactic designed to make a very silly, juvenile drama appear more adult.     Also, in what must be one of the most unoriginal pieces of casting in TV history, British actor Stephen Moyer basically repeats his turn as an ambiguously motivated Vampire from the vastly superior late nineties British Vampire series, [[ASIN:B00005KA70 Ultraviolet]]. In fact, if you want to see an intelligent, adult, brilliantly plotted series which doesn't have to rely on onscreen shock tactics, I'd recommend \\"Ultraviolet\\" over this unreservedly - if only so you can see where \\"True Blood\\" borrowed the idea of synthetic blood causing Vampires to sue for peace.

B0026P3G12|3.0|Her voice is as pure and lovely as I expected, but what a miserable choice of songs and arrangements! Everything is slowed down to tempo of a funeral dirge.  Even Daydream Believer. All the songs seem self-referential in the extreme, like \\"it's all about me.\\" I listened for the first time on my commute to work this morning and found myself forwarding through long, drawnout, boring songs. Not the best use of her talent. I hope she finds some upbeat songs in the future.
B000003ER4|5.0|Being a fan of Austrian composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1897-1957), I've waited for years to experience a performance of his 1920 three-act opera DIE TOTE STADT (German for \\"The Dead City\\"). Apart from collecting numerous recordings of the brilliant film scores he composed at the Warner Bros. studio in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s (from CAPTAIN BLOOD to DECEPTION), I've only obtained various recordings of the arias \\"Glück, das mir verblieb\\" and \\"Pierrot's Tanzlied\\" from DIE TOTE STADT, which are certainly two of the most beautiful compositions to ever come out of Korngold's head. I finally gave in to my spending urges and bought this two-disc set, which was recorded in 1975 and is considered to be the best available recording of this forgotten opera.    Freely adapted from Georges Rodenbach's 1892 novel \\"Bruges-la-Morte\\" by Erich and his father Julius (under the pen name \\"Paul Schott\\"), the story is simple: Paul (played by tenor René Kollo), mourning over the loss of his beautiful blonde wife Marie in the Belgian city of Bruges, is ecstatic to encounter her exact double one day, the flirtatious opera dancer Marietta (played by soprano Carol Neblett). After he invites Marietta to his home to sing and dance for him, she is surprised to find an elaborate \\"Temple of Memories\\" shrine to Marie there, containing a braid of her golden hair and a life-sized portrait of her. After Marietta leaves to attend her rehearsal, Paul, torn by his loyalty to the deceased Marie and his longing for the living Marietta, imagines his brief, doomed romance with Marietta that will bloom and wither in the weeks to come. Most of the opera takes place as a fantasy in Paul's troubled mind, from the ghost of Marie (also played by Neblett) appearing to Paul to encourage him to go out into life to a ghostly church procession approaching Paul's home the morning after Marietta has seduced Paul.    The casting of the two leads is nothing short of perfect, with Kollo displaying the right balance of romantic longing and obsessive, delusional mental instability in his powerful voice and Neblett providing a lovely soprano voice with appropriate touches of playfulness and mischief as Marietta. The Munich Radio Orchestra, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf, does complete justice to Korngold's extraordinary orchestrations and lovely melodies composed in the late Romantic style, which are as rich and filling as a slice of chocolate Sachertorte with fresh whipped cream from Korngold's Vienna. Almost everything musical is in here, ranging from a wind machine to a children's choir to a pipe organ to an army of church and clock bells! Incidentally, astute listeners of Korngold's film scores may easily spot brief orchestral passages that were later used in ANTHONY ADVERSE (1936), THE SEA HAWK (1940), KINGS ROW (1942), and DEVOTION (1946).    Although the CD comes with a libretto translated in English, I'd love to experience a live performance of DIE TOTE STADT in person someday. Although not for all tastes, this lushly romantic and heartbreaking opera stands as a milestone in the career of a musical genius. And Korngold was only 23 years old when this magnificent opera premiered simultaneously in Hamburg and Cologne on December 4, 1920! DIE TOTE STADT resonated with 1920s German audiences recovering from the traumatic events of World War I and soon went on to become one of the greatest hits of the decade.    My only complaints for this CD are its long tracks, which make it difficult to locate a certain section of the opera, and its somewhat high price. Despite these minor quibbles, this CD is a must-listen for any fan of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's film scores and/or classical music compositions. The intriguing story, gorgeous and haunting arias, and theme of love and loss are enough to make a statue weep.     For this Korngold fan, DIE TOTE STADT is well worth the price of admission and is something to cherish forever.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's unique ability to wrap an exciting fictional story around both real and controversial historical events has not only made him a rich man, but has created a cottage industry for other authors and producers seeking to satisfy the enormous public interest in the subject matter discussed within his books. His latest book, \\"The Lost Symbol\\", will surely stir up similar enthusiasm for historical investigation. Set in and around Washington, D.C., \\"The Lost Symbol\\" once again embroils Professor Robert Langdon in an action-packed thriller involving the United States Capitol Building, the Free Masons' role in founding this country, and a very, very scary villain.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Dan Brown's previous books, you'll no doubt love \\"The Lost Symbol\\". Aside from being a pretty exciting story, it's filled with historical asides which make for interesting Wikipedia reading.
B002X20W2E|1.0|WOW! That is all I can think of right now. I have been supporting Rihanna since her sophomore release, \\"A Girl Like Me\\". I am a HUGE fan! I even went to her concert with Chris Brown (that's another story). Even though, Rih doesn't deliver well on stage, I still supported her albums, because she always had great songs! This time around was different. I was expecting something EPIC, something WOWing! I was bored, almost every song sounded the same lyric wise, and one of my least favorite songs \\"Rockstar 101\\" reminded me of Beyonce's \\"Hip Hop Star\\". The album was beyond lackluster, there was nothing exciting about. She has a couple of good songs on there, but overall the album is missing A LOT! The album is VERY inconsistent, it's like she doesn't know what emotions she wants feel. I would have been more satisfied with something fresh and new! This album was a big disappointment. I love Rihanna but man, i am one sad fan!!!!! I should have waited until it went on sale for $3.99, or better yet, now .99 cents!! The album is TRASH! coming from a supporter!! SMH!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am listening to Susan's \\"I Dream A Dream\\" CD right now on random play (better than the straight play list, mood changes to me are remarkable...); Susan's cover of Madonna's \\"You'll See\\" is intoxicatingly angry, the darkest, blackest emotions well up inside me over how she'd been savaged by her critics since her Britains's Got Talent debut on April 11, 2009 extending the torment she'd went though all her life. But now NONE of that matters! Susan this month according to the many Internet news posts I've read - and I've been following \\"SusaNews\\" on the Internet daily since August - have that this CD WILL achive World-Wide sales of over 1,000,000 purchased units by end of November 2009 automatically putting her in the \\"A-List\\" of top selling new artists CRUSHING all those who have ridiculed her as a \\"15 minute wonder\\" and laying firm foundations of a loyal fan following. I go back to Elvis Presley's time, not since his have I seen such a singular musical phenomena, i.e. exceptional musical ability combined with a compelling personal life story. Susan ALREADY is legend and it only can grow at this point barring any catasthrophie real or cooked up by the \\"celebrity press\\" or anything she \\"does\\" to herself which I seriously doubt given her firm Catholic faith and intense devotion to her family. Her music is testament to her gritty determination in fulfillng her mother's wish to \\"make something of herself\\" and she's done it in spads with this, her first CD offering which by no inconsequential circumstance also is dedicated to her mom. Susan, the Dream is Yours to do with as your well; economic security is secured for you personaly now and for THIS devoted fan of yours THAT has and now just matters to me.

0307266303|5.0|This book was fun and exciting to read. Once I read the first page I was hooked and did not put it down until I was finished. It is based upon real people, places, and events, but reads like fiction. I've been an active runner for more than thirty years and have read many books, articles, and other material about running and this one is a real gem. My running had become a little stagnet the past couple of years and much of the joy had been missing. I was not sure if I could ever recapture the running spirit and zeal that I had enjoyed for so many years. This book has helped renew in me the joy of running once more. Novice and experienced runners will find this book insightful and fun to read. Even for non runners, this is a fun book to read.
B001GCUNW6|4.0|I've always had a soft spot for the Ice Age movies.  They were always closer to the Saturday morning cartoons which stressed fun over story, but still had a little message ticked away.  Ice Age 3 is no different, very fun, with a little bit of a message.  Again, new characters are added, most of which are fun.  The silent dinosaurs are funny, and sweet in a destructive way.  The best new addition is Buck, the crazed dino hunter/guide.  Very funny, and crazy and added another level of humor to the familiar characters that are already fun. If I had a complaint it would be the use of the coming of age story.  Like Shrek 3, this movie follows the new pattern of having a coming of age/midlife crisis story within a kids movie.  Frankly, kids movies seem to be the last place these type of stories belong.  But unlike Shrek 3, this movie wasn't bogged down by the story, but just used it as a stepping stone for more fun.    Overall, Ice Age 3 probably won't win over any new fans, but it will definitely be a lot of fun for the fans of the previous movies.  Recommended for someone looking for some fun g-rated entertainment.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had a pair of MDR7506's for 5 or 6 years and they still sound fantastic. Like all headphones, I recommend breaking them in (\\"burn in\\") before really using them - hook them up to an audio source and let a variety of music and other sounds play thru them at around half-volume overnight and they'll really sound much better.<br /><br />Over the years, I've used them in a studio, used them with an iPod, and used them to DJ with in loud nightclubs, and they are still kicking. The leatherette covering on the ear cups has fallen apart, which makes the pads not quite as comfortable or as sound-isolating, but I plan on replacing the pads (just haven't gotten to it yet!).<br /><br />I can say these are absolutely the best studio/DJ headphones for the money.
B00070DK14|4.0|My 12 year old daughter has become a Jethro Tull fanatic since we introduced her to this music about 6 months ago; she plays the flute and we thought it might be inspiring. Well, she is inspired to play Jethro Tull CDs all day long. Anyway, she wanted this one mostly for the cover, though she did listen to the sample tracks first.  We agree that this album is underrated as it is a solid album overall.  \\"Slow Marching Band\\" is quite beautiful.  There is almost another album's worth of bonus tracks -- we especially like \\"Down at the End of Your Road;\\" it is very funny.

Most of the other versions have a similar price tag, but are not hard bound with artwork.  The artwork is amazing.  There are pictures on almost every other page.  This is a COMPLETE not abridged version of the story.  It is still a very fast and enjoyable read.  I would highly recommend this version.  It is beautiful.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I find it kind of ironic that to be able to use the digital audio input you have to use the analog component video connection. if you use the HDMI port on the XBox 360 Elite, you have to capture audio from another source, in my case the analog output from the TV's AVR output.  I realize this is due in part to the design of the XBox, but disappointing none the less.  That been said, the sound is amazing!  I can hear every footstep around me in MW2.  They are very comfortable to wear for even the longest gaming session.  I highly recommend them, even with the flaws, as long as you know what they are beforehand.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Having enjoyed Susan Boyle's performance on Britain's Got Talent, I was keeping an eye out for her (hopefully just the first) CD.   I pre-ordered on Amazon, and actually got it the week before the release date.  I was worried that it would be a disappointment, but far from it.   Susan demonstrates a range that surprised me.   All the songs are fairly slow tempo, so don't expect any rock numbers from her here, but are all selected to showcase her ability to project the emotion of the song.  I particularly like her treatment of the Monkees' Daydream Believer, but there isn't a bad track on the CD.  If you liked her performances on BGT you will love the CD.
B001FB55I0|5.0|The director's cut runs approximately 3 minutes longer, and inserts a few new scenes, but no major plot points.  This is NOT the major unrated cut that McG has referred to in past interviews, where he suggested that 30-40 minutes of additional footage would be added.  We'll probably see that in a future edition.    Here are the major differences between the theatrical version and the director's cut (spoilers follow).    1) In the opening action scene, when John Connor is leading his unit into the flooded underground Skynet base, a T-1 terminator (nice touch from T3) suddenly appears behind them.  His men destroy it before it can do any damage.  I'm glad this scene was cut; it inadvertently breaks the tension too quickly.    2) When John pulls his little \\"frogman stunt\\", he is seated before the Resistance Command generals, and General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) berates John.  Ashdown says, \\"I don't believe in prophecy, not when one can re-write the future\\", pulls out his gun and points it at John's head.  I liked this scene, because it illustrates John's present and minor role in the Resistance, especially with Command being skeptical of his \\"predictions\\".    3) Blair Williams/Moon Bloodgood's topless scene; really just a side shot as she washes herself in the rain in a non-sexual manner, and Marcus glances at her briefly.      4) Marcus/Blair Williams/redneck fight; the action is a little longer, and a little more brutal.  Marcus stabs one of the attackers with a screwdriver, and we see the impact, as well as the victim painfully removing the screwdriver.  Also, Marcus uses another one of the attackers as a human shield against another's shotgun blast.    5) Marcus/Blair Williams campfire scene is slightly longer with additional dialogue between the two.    6) Captured humans at Skynet; when one of the prisoners attempts an escape and is shot, we see the bullet impacts.    7) John Connor's speech to fellow Resistance members to not obey Ashdown's orders to attack isextended with a few sentences about his mother.  I liked this scene, not sure why they cut it.  It ties T2 in, and shows the impact of Sarah Connor.  (Is this where Christian Bale had his stage lights tantrum?)    8) Marcus/T-800 fight scene is slightly longer, shows Marcus getting pummeled a bit more by the T-800.  Also, John tries to revive Marcus an additional time, before collapsing in exhaustion.    I would like to add that I enjoyed Terminator 4; much better than the campy T3, and just a shade under T2.  The action was definitely there, and McG included a lot of thoughtful touches from the past movies, e.g. photograph of Sarah Connor, the origin of John's scars, John's like for Guns N'Roses, Sarah Connor's taped voice recordings (actually Linda Hamilton's voice), use of and of course the Arnold cameo.   Who can say no to Michael Ironside?  What I didn't like was Blair Williams' geisha makeup which she wore during air combat.  It made no sense, and was probably one of the deleted portions.   Bryce Dallas Howard was believable as Kate Connor, but her screen time was too short.  Hopefully, a future cut will show more of her relationship with John.    Some have said that Christian Bale's performance was wooden, or that John Connor's role was overshadowed by Sam Worthington's role as Marcus Wright.  I disagree with both counts; Bale played Connor as he should have been; grizzled, scarred, gruff.  Given that we know so much already about the future and John's role from prior Terminator movies, it makes sense to have another character portray the center protagonist role.  I also liked the idea of the audience first seeing John as a minor Tech-Com officer, steadily rising through the ranks and gaining influence.    Additionally, the movie's opening and closing scenes had a poetic touch to it, which I appreciated.  Marcus begins the film about to be executed, giving his body to a cybernetic program.  The film ends with the same shots of needle plungers being depressed, albeit for a different reason.  Marcus leaves the world as a cyborg, but giving his body to a human cause.    I did have one concern about the movies; how come the Arnold T-800 didn't die when John Connor shot the molten steel onto its head?  Turns out there's a perfectly scientific explanation (McG consulted a metallurgist).       Here's McG's answer: \\"There are different characteristics of molten steels, and that was an earlier steel process after it had been separated from the coke. We went over this with a metallurgist, discussing which metals burn at which degrees. And also, if it had stayed on [the T-800], perhaps it would've melted him, but it was frozen quickly enough by the [liquid nitrogen]. Plus, we make the transition from the molten metal to the cooling property so quickly -- as a function of the T-800 being on [John] Connor -- that it wouldn't have had time to melt the existing titanium exoskeleton in time.\\"    In conclusion, if you're a diehard Terminator fan, go ahead and pick up this version.  Otherwise, wait for the (hopefully) longer extended cut.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|It is one of the best shows on tv. The price was very reasonable for the whole season. Seller was prompt in sending my order and the product waas in great shape. Recommend this seller to all!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD was worth the wait.  It is truly a joy and brought tears to my eyes.  Susan's voice is beautiful, her heart is in her music, she more than deserves her success.  I'll be playing this one many times over.
0061914177|2.0|Although I enjoyed reading this book and it is a quick read, I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the paper stock used to publish this book. It appears to be just slightly heavier than newsprint - pretty much a paperback book with a hardcover.    Typically, I look for books that use paper meeting the requirements of the American National Standard for Permanence of Paper for Publications and Documents in Libraries and Archives. If this is what you are looking for you will be disappointed as well.

If you have no time limit, I am ready right now.\\" Woodrow Wilson    While other authors could have covered this material in five hundred pages, I do not know of anyone else who could have covered it in eighty-three. Adrian Dayton cuts out all the fluff and delivers the goods. This book covers everything a newbie lawyer needs to started on Twitter.    Dayton practices what he preaches, distilling the important points down to their most accessible components. Even lawyers who have used Twitter for years, like myself, will learn to leverage Twitter in ways they never considered. I strongly recommend this book to any lawyer interested in getting started on Twitter. This book is all signal, no noise. Dayton knows his stuff.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|A remarkable CD that plays like classical music in a contemporary song format. The instrumentation is sometimes wonderfully medieval, always acoustic, sometimes celtic, sometimes a little operatic and incredibly atmospheric. Light some candles, turn of the electric lights, sit by the fire and be transported to a different time.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! Get a good red wine, a fresh loaf of bread and a Melody Gardot album! Beautiful effortless singing. A must have!

B0026P3G12|5.0|I had been eagerly awaiting this CD for months. It went straight from the mailbox into my CD player. Shear joy listening to Susan Boyle. While some of the songs may not have been my choice for her first CD, I truly, truly enjoyed listening to all of them. Congratulations Susan on your dream coming true. Can't wait for the next one...
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I LOVE this movie, I think is a great adaptation.  The music is wonderful (wish for the soundtrack!), the acting is superb specially Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins.  For me Rupert Penry-Jones is the perfect Capt. Wenthworth. It's an elegant and faithful interpretation of the book. I also have the 1996 Pride & Prejudice miniseries (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle)another great one. Plan to buy the new Sense & Sensibility, saw it on Masterpiece Theater and liked better than the Emma Thompson movie!
B002VKE0XA|5.0|you're either going to love or hate this movie. Either you will find the \\"found footage\\" and the way it tells the story terribly, terribly boring and you're going to laugh at the no effects and audio cues in the dark or you're going to look at it as your worst nightmare and freak.<br /><br />Honestly, I wasn't sure how I was going to react to this movie. I think sometimes the concept works and sometimes it doesn't with Blair Witch Project being the prime example for the latter. Save for the last 10 minutes of that film, I found nothing about it scary and got irritated with the characters screaming at eachother. I suppose that's what the \\"one star reviewer\\" before me was feeling when they watched this film. But I felt like one of the main differences between this movie and that one was 1) the setting. Your home is supposed to be your safe place. The woods are something people usually get lost in. And 2) characters that you give a crap about. I just didn't care about anybody in Blair Witch and therefore, got irritated with their bickering. I kind of liked the characters in this movie, they were almost painfully normal and I think the filmmakers established the level of caring between them quite well. They just seemed like a normal couple who get hit with extraordinary, and extraordinarily bad, circumstances.<br /><br />The main aspect that worked for me was the stationary camera in the bedroom. It made me nervous as hell. I felt like I was just waiting for something terrible to lunge out of the dark most of the time and sometimes, in its own way, it did. Only it wasn't overdone with CGI or Tom Savini effects. It was done with sound, slamming doors and the unseen. Personally, I've always been one who jumps at every noise at night when it breaks the silence, no matter how small. So this concept completely jived with what scares me.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie requires a lot of imagination and willingness to get to know the characters and their relationship. If you don't have the patience or the attention span for either of these things, you'll hate it. But if you get scared by things that go bump in the night and you wanna see something really scary, try to sit through this one alone with the lights out.ce or the attention span for either of these things, you'll hate it.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|So, I've been listening to Porcupine Tree for around 8 or 9 years, and although I'm into their heavier tunes, in terms of odd signature drumming, and just they way they snatch you from this surreal, beautiful sunshine day, and shove your face into the darker sides of Life...well, this collection of tunes still satisfied my craving for more of P.T. The more you listen, the more you come to realize that these guys are still very fertile, and talented songwriters...incredible!
B000I2J6K0|1.0|If you exercise regularly, please save your time and money.  I did this video in my 23rd week and I never even broke a sweat.    The video is 40 minutes long.  The first 10 minutes are a lame warm-up (as in step-touches).    The second segment is some moderately challenging lunges, squats, etc.  However, there are several segments that tell you to drink water and then you get to waste your time watching Erin drink water.  Wow, that gets my heart rate up.  At one point, the video freezes, and \\"If you have to pee, pause the video\\" comes up on the screen. Really?    The third segment is some lame pilates - I could put together a better routine myself.    The fourth segment is stretch and relaxation - I turned the dvd off at this point, out of frustration.      The production quality is laughable - I really think Erin and her husband shot and produced this right out of their house.    Even in my ninth month, I'll opt for a brisk walk over this waste of time.
0385504225|1.0|The worst from the Author. Just garbage. I rather watch home shopping network than waste time on this book. I had very big expectation but what a disappointment!
B002MW50KO|5.0|Once you get used to the idea of Dylan singing Christmas songs, this is quite good.    He sings everything in a tired sounding, scratchy voice but he seems relaxed, almost tipsy at times.    The result is festive.    I liked the way he sings Hark, since it is my all time favorite carol, I enjoyed hearing his unique take on it.    The instant I heard Dylan had performed a Christmas album, I knew I immediately had to get it!    Not disappointed.
0142000663|5.0|Perhaps no scene in literature is more haunting and powerful than the conclusion of the Grapes of Wrath.  I finished the audio book, narrated by Dylan Baker, some 2 weeks ago, and its sad irony and humanity still resonate with me.<br /><br />However, this scene is just one of dozens evoking the depths of human hope and sorrow.  If you haven't read the Grapes of Wrath, it's a journey like no other; not just into the human spirit, but into our nation's history, including vivid portrayals of farm foreclosure, migrant labor, and economics and social events that gave rise to organized labor.<br /><br />In addition to delivering highly memorable characters and scenes, Steinbeck offers an unusual but very effective structural device - narrative passages about primary characters are interspersed with passages from third-party perspectives, often resembling discrete short-stories, for example,<br /><br />- a property manager evicting a disbelieving farmer from his land<br />- a salesman selling a used car to a desperate family heading West<br />- family farms collapsing in the wake of farm-automation and vertically-integrated farm-canneries<br />- a stolid turtle trudging along an Oklahoma dust bowl road<br /><br />All-in-all, The Grapes of Wrath is a feast for the mind and imagination, as much a must-read as say, the Catcher in the Rye.<br /><br />Dylan Baker's audio CD narration is outstanding.  Like a great narrator, he's equally effective voicing male and female characters, conveying emotional depth without becoming maudlin, and maintain a good pace.  His  narration compares with some of the best efforts from the generally incomparable George Guidall.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|The Fame Monster by Lady Gaga is simply addictive. I was so happy when Gaga decided to put the new 8 songs on a EP. I have a lot of respect for this crazy, talented gal from New York. Bad Romance is the hottest dance song I have heard in 5 years! Alejandro is smooth and picturesque. Monster is creepy which is a good thing. Speechless is a power ballad about Gaga's fragile relationship with her father (her voice shines on this track), Dance in the Dark has an '80s quality like something you'd hear from Depeche Mode that's simply irresistible. Telephone is cute and features Beyonce (probably will be the next single), So Happy I Could Die is another standout track. The best song on The Fame Monster is Teeth!!!!!!!! I love the beat, lyrics, and clever arrangement. Lady Gaga can sing, write, and produce real pop music - my fingers are crossed that she will be around for a very, very long time. If Madonna is the Queen of Pop then why can't Lady Gaga be its princess? Buy this now!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has that rare voice that can sound totally different (yet recognizable) in every song. Truly a gift! At times I could swear an angel is singing. I love the album.  I am so happy that she was finally \\"discovered\\". I hope all her dreams come true!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|An amazing concert, and what a tour de force! More than two hours! That's a heck of a feat for a sixty-seven year old legend. As others have mentioned, some of Macca's live DVDs suffer from \\"crowd shot flu\\". This one has crowd shots, but for the most part they are natural and organic and don't dominate. Some surprises here, too and welcome ones. Recommended highly.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Product is good. The only problem is that it feels tight on the ears, not so comfortable.
0887307280|5.0|Although Gerber's writing style seems simplistic, his content is insightful. He's made a career of analyzing why large and small businesses fail and how to save them...or, how to build your business right, from scratch.     I have known many people whose small businesses failed, so when I was contemplating starting my own business, I felt cautious. Fortunately, a self-employed colleague recommended this book to me. After reading it, I shared Gerber's insights with several of the people I knew whose businesses had tanked, and all said that Gerber's analysis was exactly right; his book could have spared them a lot of grief.     Now, as I'm preparing to launch, I feel more confident that I am asking the right questions and developing the right systems. Especially relevant to me is his theme that loving what you do is not enough: You must learn to think from an \\"entrepreneurial perspective,\\" for which he gives step-by-step guidelines. Also essential for me are the clear instructions for developing working business systems. With these systems, I'm not just hoping things will work out, I have a reasoned plan to achieve my goals. Of course, none of us is guaranteed success, so if the proof is in the eating of the pudding, I'll update this next year to tell you how his advice worked in action. [That is, if I remember. :-)]
B002X02V02|5.0|I love Lady Gaga! I bought this version of the album specifically because it said \\"explicit\\" but it's still censored WTF!? none the less I still love it my fav songs are Monster, speechless, bad romance but their all great though
B002IYEQR4|5.0|This cut is superlative!  The animated sequences noy only enhance, but add additional depth to the movie (The best intentions can result in one becoming the very thing one is fighting.)  And of course, it now stands even closer to the original source material. I know that not everyone is a fan of the film. That's what usually happens when a movie breaks from the standard norm.  But, love it or hate it, one thing is for sure--this UC is exceptional filmmaking...the type of which is pretty damn rare.      I should also mention that, even though I did not do a side-by-side comparison, the HD PQ seems more detailed on this version.     A must for any collection.  My thanks to Snyder and all involved for going to the effort of putting together this release.  (And, as a person who hasn't read the original comics since it first came out, it's nice to have the Full-Motion HD presentation here as well.)
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I'm from M&eacute;xico, so excuse any mistakes in my english. I own this great album in Picture Disc. It's beautiful to watch, but it would have been better if it had been released in a better quality 180 gram vinyl. I don't understand why an inferior band like Metallica is releasing its new album in a better quality vinyl and Iron Maiden just in picture disc. This picture disc sounds wierd at times. Does anyone know where to send petitions for a normal vinyl release of new Iron Maiden albums?? I hope the new Iron Maiden album is released in a normal black 180 gram vinyl.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I watched the initial video of Susan Boyle on You-Tube, and I fell in love with her voice!  Later, \\"Cry Me a River\\" was online.  Overall, I enjoyed the album, because Susan kept the mood of a laid-back, jazzy feel, so that each song flows into the other.  Listenable and relaxing, and yet it shows her voice.  She is poised in her musicianship, and truly, there is no reason to spend the first album showing intensity or vocal belting to convince us that she can sing.  I do like her interpretations of others' songs.  I'm sure that she will bring forth another album.  This one is sweet gratitude.
B0026P3G12|2.0|I love Susan Boyle, but I hate this CD. It is dull and so unlike her performance on  Britain's Got Talent.    The arrangements are slow, and they all seem the same...drab.  How can you turn a fun  song from the Monkee's (Daydream Believer) into something that is boring?  I would have been nice to have had at least ONE song that had some pep in it.    On BGT, her voice was powerful, emotional and strong. She displays a beautiful  voice here, but it just doesn't have the \\"grab\\" that made me fall in love with  her on BGT.    I listened to this CD once, and probably won't again...unless I am suffering from insomnia.  I truly hope her next album is much more interesting.    I would have given it one star, if not for the fact that I like her so much.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Beyonce (formerly of the hit group \\"Destiny's Child\\") stars with Idris Elba and Ali Larter (\\"Final Destination\\") in this PG-13 \\"Fatal Attraction\\" with a plot twist. I haven't seen \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" so I can't compare the two. Ali Larter is simply temp-tacious and Beyonce is so \\"Bootylicious.\\" The only complaint I have of this suspense thriller is scenes showing the father (Elba) caring for his son. In my opinion, that's gay. Other than that, I loved this movie. Very well-written and directed. David Loughery (\\"The Three Musketeers\\") has written a superb screenplay yet again. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.
B0016MJ6HY|5.0|This was a small movie that wasn't advertised very much. I didn't hear about it until after it was in theaters, but was immediately interested, because I had always liked Norah Jones' music. The movie surprised me. It's beautifully shot (the coloring of the film is breathtaking), and all of the characters are interesting people who's lives you get a small glimpse into. The story, which is about Lizzie (Jones), who goes on an adventure after she realizes that her boyfriend is cheating on her, and realizes what she left behind is really what she truly loves. It's heart-warming, and even if it's not exactly an academy-award winner, I encourage anyone to give it a try. It's a beautiful movie that only some people will be able to see as true art.
B000002AGE|5.0|First of all, WOW, what an album cover!  A lightning storm appearing underneath a giant hat, and about ready to rip through a major populated city!  Genius!  One of the top album covers ever.    What's the music like?  It's brilliant.  It seriously is.  There's a reason this album has achieved the level of classic and has received so much recognition these days- because the kind of music you will hear on the album is melodic jazz played with a TON of passion.  It's played in such a way that connects with your feelings, and every single note tends to REALLY trigger a positive reaction out of you.    The songs are not only melodic, but the choice of instrumental variety is just perfect.  The saxophones, the keyboards, the drumming... even someone who normally doesn't like or understand jazz will find themselves easily falling in love with this masterpiece.  The songs always go somewhere, and never wander far enough away from the original theme.  No doubt an ideal approach by the members of the band to keep your attention.    Sure, Heavy Weather has a commercial sound, but I think the Weather Report deserves a commercial classic, just like every other band.  Let every great band have at least one successful commercial album I say!    I find myself more attached to the slowly-paced emotional instrumental jazz jams, and the ones that are played with more intensity involving keyboards and saxophones are really good, but for completely different reasons.  The switch between the two styles makes the album special to me.    This is the kind of album anyone getting into jazz needs to hear, much in the same way anyone getting into guitar jams needs to give Jeff Beck's Blow By Blow a serious listen.    Another classic album from the 70's!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|When I was younger, I used to love watching movies like [[ASIN:0783226039 Spartacus]], not so much because they provided particularly great depictions of ancient Rome, but because they were the way anybody get any sense of the grandeur of the Roman empire. In fact, looking back, those films were often quite cheesy. Hollywood stopped making movies about ancient Rome for a long while, until [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]] came out in 2000. As a movie, [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]] was awesome and showed a vastly more realistic yet grander Rome than ever before seen in Hollywood. Yet, as history, the movie had its flaws (most notably that it distorted the historical record quite bit). However, I'd despaired that it would be the pinnacle of our ability to visualize Rome.    I was pleasantly surprised to find that HBO did an excellent job at recreating the ancient Roman empire in its miniseries [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]]. At first, I was suspicious, worried that Rome would become twisted by HBO, the same creators of [[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City]]. Yet, the series is awesome. In terms of the production quality, it looks and feels like a big budget movie (indeed, the cost of the series eventually doomed it). The acting, visual effects, and soundtrack are exceptional (be sure to get Jeff Beal's soundtrack [[ASIN:B000MGVBQE Rome: Music from the HBO Series]]).    HBO also took care to portray Rome in a somewhat historically accurate fashion. HBO hired expert historians and consultants for every detail. Unlike most movies about ancient Rome, HBO did not shy away from portraying the less glamorous sides of Rome. In fact, much of the series deals with everyday citizens, from prostitutes to roving gangs. This in turn means that the series includes a lot of explicit sex and violence. While this means the series isn't appropriate for kids or the faint of heart, it does mean that [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]] shows Rome as it actually was.    One thing I love about this series is thatit deals with the last years of the Roman Republic, one of the most compelling eras in history. Most movies and TV shows shy away from historically important events, but HBO tackles it with gusto. The show manages to remain historically accurate while using actual historical to provide the drama in the show. HBO did a great job finding actors to portray Julius Caesar, Pompey, Mark Antony, Cato, and the rest of the dramatis personae (although I wasn't as pleased with their choices for the Augustus side of the family - see below). At times, you almost feel like you traveled back in a time machine to witness these epic events. If you're interested in this period, I'd recommend Tom Holland's [[ASIN:1400078970 Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic]] for more depth on events during the period. I only wish the series had been longer rather than only two seasons - it would have great to have seen the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD, or the end of Augustus' reign. However, apparently the budget for the show grew so large that HBO (foolishly) decided to cancel it.    My only criticism of the show is the portrayal of Augustus and his mother, Atia (Polly Walker). Historians don't necessarily have accurate information on the personalities of these figures, and there probably isn't a \\"definitive\\" interpretation of their lives. Still, I thought the show took a few too many liberties. While Atia in real life was probably cunning and ambitious, Polly Walker's version of Atia makes her into a psychotic and sadistic woman. In one scene, she even has a torture room and tortures Servilla. There's no historical basis for any of that, and it does seem a bit outlandish. For his part, Augustus as played by Simon Woods seemed a bit too dull and cynical. Again, while I'm sure Augustus must have had excellent political acumen to rise so high, he was also a brilliant administrator and did have a vision for Rome. I just didn't think HBO's depiction of either character stood up well or resembled what I had read in Anthony Everitt's excellent [[ASIN:0812970586 Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor]].    A quick note about the DVDs themselves. They are excellent quality and include hours of bonus materials, including deleted scenes and \\"making of\\" featurettes. I found some of the commentary about the interpretation of the characters pretty interesting. IF you or anybody you know loves ancient Roman history, [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]] should definitely be on your Christmas list.
B00000ING2|5.0|This was the third of a hat-trick of great Coen Brothers films and I think it is the best one. It is my favourite. The film is brightly funny but darkly satirical. It is uplifting as well. It absorbs the history of American cinema into a superb modern context, making the best of everything. It has many great set-pieces, wonderful sets and colour photography, great casting and acting. It is surely Paul Newman's best outing. Ravishing and wonderful. This is one of the best films ever made.
B000002KAT|5.0|There's really no one like Van Morrison, and this is the album that proved it.  His previous music with Them resembled classic American soul, and his first solo material added some folkie elements, so I doubt that anyone saw this coming.  Maybe that's why \\"Astral Weeks\\" didn't sell at first.  Crazy.<br /><br />Then again, maybe \\"Astral Weeks\\" didn't sell just because it's very difficult to talk about this music in any but the vaguest terms (\\"You should hear this stuff, because...uh...\\").  Van wrote a group of songs about things that are notoriously difficult to express, and he used ideas and forms appropriate to the purpose.  These are the kind of lyrics that let some people compare rock lyrics to poetry - not a great idea most of the time - and the music consists primarily of jazz voicings (gasp).  Most of these numbers have the feel of a man lost in his own emotional world, often watching someone outcast from society and seeing beauty there that no one else is aware of.  Since pop and rock music, of the kind Morrison made before, is usually about the guy either getting the girl or losing her, this kind of ambiguity didn't play very well at all.<br /><br />Today, \\"Astral Weeks\\" makes just about every Top Ten Albums list we see.  Why that has changed for the pop music audience isn't entirely clear, but it's good news, since it suggests that quality will find an audience eventually.<br /><br />Maybe it's just that we eventually found ourselves in a similar fix as the man in these songs.  In the title track he asks \\"If I ventured in the slipstream...would you find me?\\" and a lot of us might very well find that this question expresses our own sense of loneliness and confusion, I'll bet.  Meanwhile, the musical bed consists for a few minutes of little but light percussion, high-end acoustic bass and flute, with a string section jumping in just at the chorus.  Anything heavier would be a little too bombastic; you don't go seeking companionship by yelling and screaming, after all.<br /><br />The rest of the album proceeds accordingly, with time out for a little swinging brass on \\"The Way That Young Lovers Do\\".  Other than that, it's bassist Richard Davis's show all the way, rooting the guitar and the flute, as well as the vibes and acoustic guitar.  All of this apparently allows Van to meditate on some of the sights and characters he remembers from his home in Belfast.  It sure sounds like a meditation, of the hypnotic rhythm sort; Van devotes a lot of energy to a sort of free-jazz scat singing, repeating miscellaneous syllables for several bars at a time (\\"wayupon wayupon wayupon\\") until you're not sure whether he's just chanting or channeling.  I can't think of anyone who ever wrote or sang like this, and Van himself rarely did it again on record.<br /><br />That manner of playing and singing speaks of a certain attitude toward those Belfast sights and characters.  As I said, most of them would be considered outcasts, including the singer himself; it's pretty common knowledge, for instance, that when Van was growing up, Cypress Avenue was an upscale neighborhood, so when he says \\"I'm caught one more time up on Cypress Avenue,\\" it's fairly clear that he doesn't think he belongs there.  Some say that the title character of \\"Madame George\\" is an aging transvestite, and the subject of \\"Beside You\\" seems to be a young street urchin.  You can probably find other examples for yourself.  Whoever these people are, though, the point is that Van's music dances all around these people in a fascination trance, anchored by that jazz bass and brought into focus by the instruments and vocals.<br /><br />That's all the more remarkable when you consider that by most accounts, these musicians spent rather less than 12 hours on this album and some of them couldn't even remember the session afterwards.  Whatever they did, it seems to have been one of those rare times when everything worked, so that a song about some poverty-stricken brat digging through the gutter trash might as well be about an angel of light.<br /><br />Well, maybe that's overdoing it some - I'll hear these songs my way and you hear them yours.  The compassion is undeniable, though, and you don't need to strain to find it by overinterpreting the lyrics.  All you need to do is let Van's voice and the instrumental excellence carry you through to the tail end.  \\"I know you're dying,\\" Van whispers, \\"and I know you know it too / Every time I see you / I just don't know what to do.\\"  Except empathize, which is actually more than good enough because empathy is in short supply today.  And that may finally explain how \\"Astral Weeks\\" found its audience.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Seek the human touch and you'll eventually find it.gel of light.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's singing is like an intimate conversation with each listener. She is able to convey emotions that are understood at a level deeper than language. There is something so compelling about Susan's singing that one can listen to her songs any number of times without diminishment of enjoyment.  Having listened to her earlier recording of \\"Cry Me A River,\\" I was apprehensive about her being able to recapture that definitive interpretation, but I need not have worried; she breathes life into this song as no one ever has or likely ever will.      This debut CD is so fantastic that only Susan, herself, can top it!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|When I was younger, I used to love watching movies like [[ASIN:0783226039 Spartacus]], not so much because they provided particularly great depictions of ancient Rome, but because they were the way anybody get any sense of the grandeur of the Roman empire. In fact, looking back, those films were often quite cheesy. Hollywood stopped making movies about ancient Rome for a long while, until [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]] came out in 2000. As a movie, [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]] was awesome and showed a vastly more realistic yet grander Rome than ever before seen in Hollywood. Yet, as history, the movie had its flaws (most notably that it distorted the historical record quite bit). However, I'd despaired that it would be the pinnacle of our ability to visualize Rome.    I was pleasantly surprised to find that HBO did an excellent job at recreating the ancient Roman empire in its miniseries [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]]. At first, I was suspicious, worried that Rome would become twisted by HBO, the same creators of [[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City]]. Yet, the series is awesome. In terms of the production quality, it looks and feels like a big budget movie (indeed, the cost of the series eventually doomed it). The acting, visual effects, and soundtrack are exceptional (be sure to get Jeff Beal's soundtrack [[ASIN:B000MGVBQE Rome: Music from the HBO Series]]).    HBO also took care to portray Rome in a somewhat historically accurate fashion. HBO hired expert historians and consultants for every detail. Unlike most movies about ancient Rome, HBO did not shy away from portraying the less glamorous sides of Rome. In fact, much of the series deals with everyday citizens, from prostitutes to roving gangs. This in turn means that the series includes a lot of explicit sex and violence. While this means the series isn't appropriate for kids or the faint of heart, it does mean that [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]] shows Rome as it actually was.    One thing I love about this series is thatit deals with the last years of the Roman Republic, one of the most compelling eras in history. Most movies and TV shows shy away from historically important events, but HBO tackles it with gusto. The show manages to remain historically accurate while using actual historical to provide the drama in the show. HBO did a great job finding actors to portray Julius Caesar, Pompey, Mark Antony, Cato, and the rest of the dramatis personae (although I wasn't as pleased with their choices for the Augustus side of the family - see below). At times, you almost feel like you traveled back in a time machine to witness these epic events. If you're interested in this period, I'd recommend Tom Holland's [[ASIN:1400078970 Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic]] for more depth on events during the period. I only wish the series had been longer rather than only two seasons - it would have great to have seen the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD, or the end of Augustus' reign. However, apparently the budget for the show grew so large that HBO (foolishly) decided to cancel it.    My only criticism of the show is the portrayal of Augustus and his mother, Atia (Polly Walker). Historians don't necessarily have accurate information on the personalities of these figures, and there probably isn't a \\"definitive\\" interpretation of their lives. Still, I thought the show took a few too many liberties. While Atia in real life was probably cunning and ambitious, Polly Walker's version of Atia makes her into a psychotic and sadistic woman. In one scene, she even has a torture room and tortures Servilla. There's no historical basis for any of that, and it does seem a bit outlandish. For his part, Augustus as played by Simon Woods seemed a bit too dull and cynical. Again, while I'm sure Augustus must have had excellent political acumen to rise so high, he was also a brilliant administrator and did have a vision for Rome. I just didn't think HBO's depiction of either character stood up well or resembled what I had read in Anthony Everitt's excellent [[ASIN:0812970586 Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor]].    A quick note about the DVDs themselves. They are excellent quality and include hours of bonus materials, including deleted scenes and \\"making of\\" featurettes. I found some of the commentary about the interpretation of the characters pretty interesting. IF you or anybody you know loves ancient Roman history, [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]] should definitely be on your Christmas list.
0385504225|2.0|If there was a long lost formula for writing a formulaic work of fiction, then Robert Langdon would be the man to track it down and decipher its many interpretations to the point of exhaustion, all while being chased through corridors, caverns and cathedrals. Dan Brown is definitely using this formula in The Lost Symbol, his remarkably similar follow-up to The Da Vinci Code. In this go round, the Masonic Order and Washington DC are his subject and setting, as a mysterious tattooed man threatens to bring the secret society to its knees. After having gained surreptitious initiation into The Order's 33rd degree, our villain kidnaps a close Masonic friend of Langdon's in his quest to learn the most hidden and revered secrets of the society. The book derails about a quarter the way through, round about the time that Langdon starts \\"remembering\\" the most inconceivably remote coincidences of Masonic symbology. A reader can only suspend their disbelief for so long, and Langdon's photographic memory does a bit too much heavy lifting here for such a slight frame. Full credit must be given to Brown for his thorough research, and for the inclusion of some interesting code breaking puzzelry and a plethora of military and CIA minutia. He even opens the door to the unique world of noetic science, which no doubt will serve to enlighten a few readers with its bizarre claims and pursuits. But the sum of many interesting parts does not make for a very engaging read. At the end we are left with a plot twist that was a dead give away in the first few chapters, and a long drawn out conclusion that fizzles and pops with very little resolve. Dan Brown had a tough hill to climb after having reached such a pinnacle with his previous work; the subject of The Lost Symbol worked, he just could have told a much better story with the formula he seems so comfortable using on each expedition.
B002MW50KO|5.0|In our dreary world of these modern times what a delightful Xmas gift from Captain Bob to his fans.

B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Like the girl that is made to eat chocolate, as if it were excrement, that's what I think of this movie.  Imagery and metaphors notwithstanding this movie has no value whatsoever, either artistically or as entertainment, with or without shock value.      I wasted good money to buy it and now I am going to break it up and throw it away, better yet burn it!  On a final note I must say that I feel sorry and sad for those people that think that it is a great movie and that it represents anything other than crap.

B001DSNF8C|3.0|No quiero hacer una crítica muy profunda respecto a la película en si, la cual no se puede decir que es una de las mejores de la serie. Sin embargo la calidad del disco blu ray es muy buena, aunque no existan muchas opciones en cuanto a audio, ya que incluye solo dos idiomas, pero existen mas opciones de subtítulos. Me parece que a este respecto el disco blu ray es suficientemente grande como para agragar mas idiomas por lo que los estudios deberian preocuparse por agregar más de esto.  También se incluye un disco de adicionales muy extenso, asi que si te gustan este tipo de adicionales tienes bastante para entretenerte.
0316001821|4.0|Although this book wasn't my favorite, I can see why others have enjoyed it. At times it was disturbing but always made me want to keep reading. The ending wasn't at all what I expected which is a relief because so many books are predictable. All in all, this book is a quick, easy read and worth a few dollars. I can see it becoming a decent movie too.
B002X063OC|4.0|WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!! When she first came out with \\"Just dance\\" i was like...lame. Then came \\"Pokerface\\" and \\"Love Game\\" and \\"Paparazzi\\" I was like...okay, she could get the party jumpin with her music. Then when I heard \\"Bad Romance\\" i was like...I love it. Then came \\"Telephone\\" \\"Monster\\" and \\"Alejandro\\" now my ipod is stuck on replay. I immediately erased my bootlegged versions from my player and actually bought the tunes from amazon to show my support and love for her music. I may not be a huge fan of hers, but i support her for her work. Thanks Lady Gaga for sharing your work...even though you're a bit on the nutty side.
B000KIE11Q|4.0|the watch was ok but the case which came with it was broken. I don't know whether it was sent broken or it was broken while on transit. but over all experience, the watch is ok.
B000002P7R|4.0|This collection in no way compares to the authorized releases, but there are a few songs here that are just remarkable. Some of my favorite Hendrix stuff, in fact. First \\"South Saturn Delta\\" injects Chicago style horns into a cooking soul number. A great mix. The horns are extremely effective at expanding the sonic palette, a strong clue to as to what Jimi would have been exploring had he not slipped away so soon. Next, \\"The  Stars that Play with Laughing Sam's Dice\\" builds real nicely to a near cacophonous din, but never falls apart. The mix is extremely unusual, very thin and harsh. Almost a Punk sound. As a live take you can smell the sweat and smoke.<br /><br />My next choice is \\"Pali Gap\\" 'cause it just feels so good; a relaxed, exotic voyage to the edge of civilization and beyond. Jimi's guitar at times sounds like gourde drums and xylophone. It was inspired by his trip to Hawaii.<br /><br />Then there's the alternate take of \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" which for me is the greatest cover song ever done by anyone. This version is nearly identical to the \\"Electric Ladyland\\" version but with some slightly different mixing and effects.<br /><br />The rest are all OK samples, demos and unfinished tracks. There are better versions of some of them on other albums, like \\"Tax Free\\" on \\"Live At Winterland\\", \\"Power of Soul\\" and \\"Message to the Universe (Message to Love)\\" on \\"Band Of Gypsies\\", and \\"Bleeding Heart\\" on \\"Blues:\\". There's a shorter but more finished version of \\"Pali Gap\\" on the out-of-print but available \\"Voodoo Soup\\".<br /><br />If you enjoy Hendrix for what he does better than anyone who ever lived - play guitar - then it's no chore getting through this disc. The real great thing about digital music today is how you can remix the order of songs and combine with other albums to create fresh presentations. This disc is a great place to pick from.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia is such a fantastic film...This two disc DVD set covers everything that you could possibly want. Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seigfreid and the rest of the cast was brilliantly cast in the perfect roles for them...Highly Recommended...This is the feel good movie of the year!
B002BPQ0Y2|4.0|When Fergie jumped on the bandwagon with these guys i was like okay. \\"Elephunk\\" grew on me like mold and I had to go buy the cd. Then came \\"monkey business\\" and i was at the store on its out date. As for this one, it's not better than the others but it's up there. This group grew on me, because they are always updating which is good. They were good without Fergie at first but now they're better. So hopefully they keep improving on their styles so I could once again be in that line when they drop a new cd.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|As I never watched the Cartoon, I can only judge this flic on it's own merits, and it was a roller coaster ride from the minute it started! I really enjoyed it!
078322611X|5.0|Delivered to my home very well packaged, I am pleased with the shape it came and I watched it and the disc was in great shape
B002WLTI62|5.0|I am always previewing new music online and I literally rushed out to get this cd. Sure there is a tinge of a Britney sound to a song or two but the album is a knockout just like her dance moves.It's been awhile since Oral Fixation and she just got better, more defined. I am now a huge fan.
B00192IV0O|5.0|Boom Boom Wow!  The polular songs are of course great; however, there are even better songs that really tell a story.  Listening to the whole CD straight through; it is almost like a musical.  Track 14 sums it up!  So, sit back, relax and get ready to Rock!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|The first time I saw this in the theater, I have to say I was disappointed. I wasn't expecting an Indiana Jones type Van Helsing... but it is a great movie, a real roller coaster ride, and a fantastic looking Blu-Ray!
076780421X|5.0|I am very pleased on how it arrived to my home, the DVD is in wonderful shape.
B002X20W2E|2.0|and the worst performance on the AMA's, I blame her label. Good girl gone bad is one of my all time faves and I could not be more disappointed by her new direction plus the explicit lyrics and the outfits make her look and sound cheap. Adam Lambert and Gaga are better performers, and if you are looking for a knockout album, spend your 9.99 on Shakira.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Boyle should be very pleased with her first release.....heartfelt, great choice of songs, and that wonderful pure voice.  I'm very happy for her.....
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I went to see this movie at the theaters. It will definitely make you jump. The people in my theater were all jumping at the same parts I was and screaming in unison (I didn't scream though.. really.. I swear.. I don't do that type of thing.. ) which tells me the movie did its job which was to scare  and entertain...<br /><br />The good thing about it is it plays on your primal fears. It's not a \\"blood and guts\\" type horror film. If you watch it in a quiet and dark place, you will jump. I was at the movies and, during the movie, near the beginning, my cell phone vibrated in my pocket and scared the heck out of me, that's how tightly wound this movie keeps you.It's intense to watch as it has you strung up waiting for the next spooky thing to happen and the movie keeps building on that tension. You almost feel tired when the movie is over from being so tense and anxious the whole movie.<br /><br />Yeah, it plays on the typical spooky tricks employed in most horror movies .. things jumping out at you, loud noises, etc. but it does so in a very good way. The story itself is interesting but not great. It's just a fun movie to watch with people. It will definitely spook you. Most people who did not like this movie focus on the fact that the story wasn't good. If you want a scary movie to watch, that doesn't have blood and guts, this is a good movie for you. You may not sleep for awhile after seeing it....
B002QB1910|3.0|\\"Rated R\\" is Rihanna's heartfelt, emotional, most realist album to date; or so she claims.  The only development into the \\"emotional\\", \\"raw\\" aspect of the album is the lyrics.  For those of us who know better than to tangle with a man (or woman) who hits us, there's no substance in this record.  The only other topics covered in this record are dress well and be a badass (the idiotic \\"G4L\\").    \\"Mad House\\", a brilliant, gritty intro that really should have been a full-track, starts off the album; we're warned that if we're scared easily this may not be the experience we want.  I'm of a tough resolution, so I delved in.  Songs like the jerky, pop \\"Wait Your Turn\\", the dumb \\"So Hard\\", and grimy, rockout \\"Rockstar 101\\" are missing the bravado necessary to make the tracks believable.  Where's the hardcore \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" vocal styling's?    For those of us who anticipated heartfelt singing from the battered starlet, we're only disappointed.  In the past, Rihanna has delivered the emotion on tracks she [probably] had no emotional connection to (e.g., \\"Take a Bow\\" and \\"Unfaithful\\") but this is not the case on \\"Rated R.\\"  \\"Stupid in Love\\", a poignant down-tempo reflection on the lows of love, is about as emotional as Rihanna gets.  Though the new-waveish \\"Photographs\\" is touching and believable.  The lead single \\"Russian Roulette\\", outstanding Latin/Caribbean \\"Te Amo\\", and boring \\"Cold Case Love\\" emulate Mariah Carey.  And that's not a good thing; instead of Mariah's astonishing vocals, Rihanna has chosen instead to mimic Mimi's inability to emotionally feel the lyrics she sings.  Rihanna's performances in her ballads remind me of Mariah Carey's \\"When I Saw You\\".      In all, I am disappointed at the amateurish sound of this record.  The beats are on point; the lyrics are strong, but the vocal delivery is weak and disconnected.  Considering how fierce Rihanna has portrayed herself recently, it's just flabbergasting to come across such a vocally vapid record.  I expect this kind of disconnect from artists like Brooke Hogan, Miley Cyrus, or Heidi Montag but not Rihanna.  Maybe this album only underscores that she's young, she's learning and growing, and she's caught up in her own hype.  Given the pleasant evolution Rihanna has undergone from \\"Music of the Sun\\" through this album, I can only expect that her next album will blow me away.    Strongest Tracks: \\"Rockstart 101\\", \\"Photographs\\", \\"Te Amo\\"
B00260HH3K|1.0|On its own, this is an absolutely horrible movie. To Dragonball Fans this is an absolute disgrace.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|I liked everyone in the movie except Justin Long.  It's something about his eyes that makes it look like he really is just reciting lines.  Also, they should have threatened McLane's family much earlier.  The truck and fighter jet sequence was terrible.  Great movie overall and fine addition to the series.
B002MW50KO|1.0|A musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want. But I hate it when they try to join the Bing Crosby holiday hit parade. At least Elvis was able to produce some brilliance in this area,like \\"Blue Christmas\\". This is tweedily dumb.
0385504225|3.0|The first two thirds of the book I think I am reading a Tom Harris Hannibal Lechter type of book.  Story moves fast and is a page turner.  Seems as though the whole story is told over a 10 to 14 hour time period (better than \\"24\\").  Story has many twists and turns and is a good read on those dark and cold winter nights.  I won't give away any of the surprises (you can read other reviews for that)but with all good suspense novels don't even try to guess where it is heading or who is who just enjoy the read if it is your cup of tea.  There won't be many great revelations or some extraordinary ending but it is a good (not great) read.
B002QB1910|5.0|I have been a Rihanna fan since she started and I know talent when it comes out and I love to sing her songs they instantly change my mood..  But I truly love how she has such a spice to everything she does. It's diffrent and no one can compare to her.I hope Rihanna goes all the way to the top cause she is surely doing daring things that stands out from other artist.I love her voice because its diffrent and she is herself she took her dream and believed in herself and is topping the charts. I wish her luck and want more great albums as this one. This album is Awesome!! Go Rihanna...
B0007Y08I8|5.0|leave it to MATT and TREY to rip virtually everything the united states does and stands for a new one . the soundtrack alone is priceless . ripping off the lame THUNDERBIRDS as a launching point for humor and commentary was inspired . while difficult to watch in a mostly empty movie theater , once at home you're free to laugh with abandon while watching one of the funniest films ever concieved . seeing MOORE blow himself up is worth the price of admission alone . genius . flawless . thanks guys .
B00028XEEO|5.0|I just got this Japanese remastered reissue and it is stunning. I've loved this album since it's original release in 1975 and I have it in several different issues on vinyl and on cd. This I believe is the first time it has been remastered and the sound quality is exquisite. Extremely clean and clear with deep, well defined bass and excellent imaging. In addition to that, the cover has been finally made available on cd exactly how it was when the album was released on vinyl originally. The artwork, typography and the inside artwork on this gatefold sleeve are exactly as specified originally. Nothing is altered or left out. It is a most spectacular package for one of the best synth albums ever made. Phaedra, (which came before) has also been given the same treatment with equally stunning results.  Both of these releases are must haves. The Japanese did a super job on the covers. No annoying UPC symbols. No FBI warnings against piracy. Just the entire package as it originally looked. The cd label is a reproduction of the original Virgin label on the vinyl. Beautiful. The cd comes in a sleeve and slides easily in the jacket. There is a great sway in prices for this. I got mine from InandOut Records in Austria, an amazon seller and everything arrived just fine. The cover for Rubycon is a nice glossy finish like the original and the cover for Phaedra is satin just like the original. These two releases really epitomize what the art of the cd can be.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I was watching the night the original Star Trek premiered on NBC, wrote several letters to the network advising them to renew it for a second and third season and attended the first Star Trek convention at the Statler-Hilton in New York in 1971.  I've been a Star Trek fan for over 40 years.  And I love this new film.  I saw it the first day it opened, later on an Imax screen and on an airplane flight to Las Vegas.  It is a great film from its incredibly exciting pre-credit opening to its conclusion.  Yes it does change the history and continuity of Star Trek.  However it has added an excitement to Star Trek that has not been seen since Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.    I'm not going to go into detail about why I enjoy it so much:others have gone over that ad nauseum.  The entire cast is terrific, although I must point out Karl Urban who nails DeForest Kelley as Dr McCoy better than I could possibly have imagined.  The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray is terrific, the extra features are good and the deleted scenes help flesh out scenes left in the film.  (I have no doubt Paramount will be releasing another version of the DVD and blu-ray with additional scenes sometime in the near future.)  In conclusion, whether you are a Star Trek fan or not, if you'd like an all-around terrific film and you haven't seen this one, you really should.
1906355630|5.0|This book is not ony great for lawyers, but for anyone that wants to be a twitter. This is an easy step by step that can save you hundreds of hours finding out for yourself. Thank you, I am now a Twit.
B000QUEHOO|2.0|This (excellent) book comes with two sets of images: 1) maps of the places where the different societies mentioned lived (Easter Island, Australia, Greenland, China, etc.) and 2) Sets of plates with 40 or so additional photos. The maps are included in the Kindle edition, although they don't look too god. The screen resolution is too small, so they look very, very blurry and the text in the maps is utterly unreadable. I uploaded a couple of screen grabs so you can judge for yourselves. Can anyone read the names of those tiny little islands? Thank God we have Google Earth. As for the plates mentioned in the text, well, they ain't there at all. That's a sloppy digitalizing job, Penguin.
0545123267|5.0|Okay instead of giving a story synopsis like so many have done, I wanted to address the \\"issues\\" being brought up in reviews.    I also need to admit that I'm only 3/4 of the way through and so far I love it (I was up til 2am just reading.. which hasn't happened to me in a long time.)    Point 1: The romance is too sticky-sweet and not enough conflict.  Actually I really liked that. I am glad to see a simple teen love story in which only outter conflict plays a role. To draw on Twilight.. I hate Edwards whole \\"'m obssessed with Bella but I'm dangerous and should stay away from her..but I just can't seem too\\" overdone dillema.  I found the romance believable, sweet and endearing, and I do believe the author does a good job of justifying their obsession which each other (childhood-thing etc.)    Point 2: The writing is too \\"poetic-wannabe\\" or overly metaphorical  Well I guess it all depends on what you like. I found the writing to be poetic and seemless and not overdone to the point of clunkiness. Granted others did feel it was too much. For me I still think this fell into the realm of lyrical writing and I wasn't jarred from my reading because of it. Her intent to draw me in with her writing style for ME it worked.    Point 3: Plot holes galore.. ways to solve the problem easily were rejected  How many times do we look at people's complex lives and think \\"you know if they would just do xyz they wouldn't be in this problem?\\". But the fact is, people do make stupid or not right choices, or don't find the easy solutions to their problems. I wasn't bothered by the fact that Sam didn't just chooose to live in a hot climate and \\"wee problem solved\\". This wasn't about THAT story. This was about the story of the boy who didn't choose to leave, who chose to live where he lived and the consequences of those choices. I didn't find that to be a \\"plot hole\\" as many have pointed out.    Point 4: Grace's absentee parents  Yes it's true lately I've been reading a lot of books that seem to do away with parents in any way they can. They either die, or the kid is sent away to some distant relative regardless, or just don't seem to be around much.  While this is the case here, at the very least their lack of presence is brought up in the book and the consequences of their lack of presence is evident and truly portrayed in the anguish Grace sometimes feels when it comes to her relationship with her parents. Sure it may have seemed like an easy way to deal with her parents, but at the very least I am glad it was addressed as an emotional portion of Grace's character. It wasn't just ignored.    Point 5: Choice of writing style: small chapters/switch of POV  Well again it boils to personal preference. I actually really liked the style used of switching points of view. I feel it was well executed and didn't pull me out of the story. For others this might not be the case.    Point 6: Twilight rip-off  On the surface the stories seem very similar. Star struck teens, supernatural creatures, and woe is me how is this going to ever work.  But Stephanie Meyers and Maggie Stiefvater are two verrry different storytellers and draw from completely different pools in terms of their writing craft. I did not find myself saying \\"oh that is oh so Twilight\\" in any part of the book.  \\"There is nothing new under the sun\\" and there is really no new stories to be told. I think this one stands on it's own feet and isn't seeking to be some 'human-werewolf/werewolf-werewolf' showdown in the same way Twilight spends time on the \\"we must stay hidden and blend\\" conflict that keeps popping up. This seems much more focused on a romance that is possibly doomed and the ways the characters try to problem solve themselves to a hopefully happy ending.    All in all I don't disagree that these points people have brought up are valid (except for the Twilight rip-off one.. that one I think is a stretch imo), only that it doesn't necessarily mean that the story as a whole will not be enjoyed. For all it's flaws, I am still drawn in and loving the simpliticity of this \\"first love\\" romance and I find the writing to be exceptional and poetic without being clunky or overdone.    I do highly recomment it to teens and YA novel lovers and tell them to draw their own conclusions.
B001KVZ6G6|2.0|I really enjoy the first half of this movie, for this reason I bought it. The old mam the child, the flying house, the big bird, even the dog. It was touching...    The film fails in the end with its...(or film makers, as every animation movie is made from a lot of talented creative people) use or introduction of a VILLAIN!.   Kids I talked to say the same thing, the villain was not necessary, or the worse aspect of the film.  The movie would have been better paced out if they just found things from the Villain who should have been dead by then anyways(years???).  If they had the dogs acting as a pack, carrying out his wishes then maybe... Better yet they should have had the story focus on the jungle, and the goal of reaching Paradise Falls, using the jungle and the other animals as well hurdles.      Finding Nemo could be used as an example for its no usage of a true villain.  Nemo had obstacles, more than one villain. Or hurdles, where they overcome the best and worse of what the sea had to offer. No I don't think the girl and the dentist where villains. Wall-e was good too, Bolt was ok, Cars... villains are overrated unless they truly engulf the film... most of the fav villains have been from 2d classic movies(most are women?)... Monster House was a good sort of villain(again a woman). Monster Inc is good...    I hope the reason for the delay of Finding Nemo on BLU-RAY is that they plan to release it in 3D like Toy Story1 and 2.... I doubt it....
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's album is incredible - her rendition of How Great Thou Art gave us goosebumps - I have purchased additional copies for family and friends.  The combination of songs is very touching - they must be songs which are close to her heart, and her heart sings on this album.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, but was irked by the fullscreen format. Who would expect a \\"Special Edition\\" to have a modified aspect ratio? Just on a hunch, I checked out Amazon.co.uk, and the Special Edition there is presented in widescreen format, as the picture was intended to be seen. If you have a multi-region dvd player and would like to see the widescreen version, buy the PAL disc from the U.K. Be warned that it is region 2 and will not play on American dvd players unless they are multi-region.
B002VECM40|5.0|There is not one false moment in this movie.  Every frame, every actor, every word is perfect.  Precious had been serially raped by her father.  We meet her as an obese sixteen year old who is smart but hides it well.  After finally moving out of her mother's house, she becomes determined to mother her children and make something of her life.  You won't see dramatic changes, but rather shifts in Precious' attitude that will enable her to develop.  We don't ever discover her abilities, but we know she will break the cycle of abuse into which she was born.  This is an excruciatingly painful movie to watch, but it's message is important.  No matter how beaten anyone is, with determination, we can get help,  own our own lives, and develop into the people we were meant to become.  Well done.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang has taken a relatively unknown event (at least it was before her bestselling history of this battle of Nanking) and made an international expose of these events.  Chang has every reason to be extremely biased in her telling of this event, but she has taken the proverbial \\"high road\\" and remained detached from the cruelty in her telling of this story.  Chang is excellent as an historian finding and digging through facts and interviews and then documenting them in fine detail.  The author reached back to find where the philosophies of Japanese warriors and then State driven military psyche began and how they affected the individual soldiers.<br /><br />The Battle of Nanking took place in December, 1937 just after the fall of Shanghai.  The Japanese were extended their imperial reach into China proving that Chiang Kai-Shek and his army were inadequately prepared for this type of battle.  Author Iris Chang gives a credible version of the military plans and how the Chinese were simply overrun by a more technologically advanced and more mentally prepared Japanese army even though the Chinese army in this area outnumbered the Japanese by at least a 5:1 ratio.<br /><br />In addition to providing a fairly graphic portrayal of the events as Nanking fell, Chang beautifully digs deep for personal stories of heroism.  She tells of a German Nazi, John Rabe and calls him the Oskar Schindler of China.  Rabe stood up to the rampaging Japanese as he attempted to save thousands of Chinese civilians trying to escape their own version of the Holocaust.  Then to complete the telling, Chang offers the rest of the story: she traced forward each of the heroes and told their tales after the war and their saint-like efforts.  These are not pretty stories.<br /><br />The burying of this event in the annals of Japanese history is also brought to light by Chang.  She finds the individuals responsible for hiding the atrocities and then highlights the efforts of those that have struggled to bring out the facts in a Japan that was trying to sweep this under the carpet.<br /><br />Iris Chang is superb in her telling of this story.  The Chinese owe a debt of gratitude to Chang for pulling together this book, translating the information and then writing a landmark book.  I highly recommend this book.facts in a Japan that was trying to sweep this under the carpet.    Iris Chang is superb in her telling of this story.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Each one of her songs speaks to your heart. She is an inspiration of what can be. A reminder of how judgemental we all are before we truly know the gifts each of us have to offer. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every song. Pure beauty!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I'm delighted to report that this CD is beautiful and that Susan Boyle can really sing.  Her voice is truly lovely -- clear and expressive.  She shows off a range of styles here, and everything works.  The clever transformation of familiar songs into something new suits her skills.  \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\" work well as ballads, as do the more familiar ballads \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"End of the World.\\"  Ms. Boyle knows when to hold back, and when to pull all the stops out.  Susan can even deliver good gospel!  I'm not a fan of the \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" type of material that brought her to the public's attention, but there's no denying that she can carry it off.      There's no charity or pity in my review, and Susan's fame is no fluke.  Well done, Ms. Boyle, and congratulations.

B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I gave this movie a 5 star rating because I really liked it.<br />Unfortunately,I was really ticked off because I expected there<br />to be SOME relation to the book.Other than the title,this movie<br />has nothing to do with the book whatsoever !!!<br />I hope that they will make a movie of the book titled The Bourne<br />Ultimatum some day, because it has a really good story.
B000000JO3|5.0|Minor threat is the best thing that happen to punk rock. Finally an influential band who didn't have crack addict members. Along with Black flag, Minor threat's fast positive heavy angry music was the best thing to happen to real punk and hardcore. They were one of the first hardcore punk bands and in my opinion the greatest. You want real punk real hardcore? Minor threat is the band to listen to. It will change your life, and make you think again next time you want to party and drink beer or snort that white crack and smoke. You can't go wrong with Ian's powerful lyrics, along with the music it's the best damn music you'll ever hear. Wish i could go back to the early 80's and witness Minor Threat. Today's hardcore is fake, Minor Threat gives you nothing but pure energy and actually makes you think!
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|Casino Royale was great and of course there was going to be a sequel. Unfortunately, we got this. It just doesn't feel like a Bond film. Sure there's a guy named James Bond who drives an Aston Martin and just happens to work for the British government and a woman named M but its just not the same. Whereas Casino Royale did feel like a Bond film, just not as much since they were exploring how Bond began. For the first part of the film, all Craig does is kill people left and right and there are action sequences one right after the other, which doesn't help much. About halfway through though the story does start to take shape with the introduction of the mysterious Quantum organization (reminiscent of SPECTRE) and Mr. White appears in the beginning and in the middle (a possible recurring villain like Blofeld?). I just don't think the producers put that much effort into this one, probably just thought people would see it because of how successful the previous film was. The acting though is excellent. Daniel Craig adds more emotional depth to Bond as recovers from the loss of Vesper. Olga Kurylenko is also an emotionally scarred character and will probably the one Bond girl 007 doesn't sleep with. Mathieu Almeric is pretty bad as the villain but that's not his fault as the Greene really isn't that interesting of a character. Dench continues to be the definitive M, conveying that she wants to trust Bond but wants him to control his emotions. This is David Arnold's worst score out of his five (I think its time for the producers to look elsewhere), sounding listless for the softer scenes and obnoxious for the action. And again, no James Bond Theme in this. Jack White and Alicia Keyes sing THE worst (yes, Madonna's is slightly better) Bond song, though the backing music sounds good, should've been an instrumental. Hopefully, with the traditional gun barrel used at the end, it will herald the return of a more traditional Bond film.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|I bought the UP Blu-ray 4 disc version just so I could have the SD DVD with English subtitles.  I had the NetFlix version of UP and it had no subtitles or closed captioning.  Neither version plays on my computer and both versions are programmed to start with coming attractions.  The copy protection on these Disney DVDs is similar to the Sony DVD copy protection on many of its DVD releases at the start of 2007, movies like Casino Royale and The Pursuit of Happyness.  Then, Sony admitted that about 25 million of its movie DVDs used copy protection software that prevented many DVD players from playing the DVDs.  Disney will never admit it is selling DVDs crippled by defective copy protection software. Nor will Disney acknowledge that it is shortchanging customers by not putting Spanish or French language tracks or closed captioning on some of its new SD DVD releases.  The Mouse House seems now to be only good at firing longtime executives with one hour notice and selling shoddy DVDs of recent movie releases.  At least the Disney Treasures DVDs are still quality mastering jobs.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|The good.  I like the idea of creating the alternate time line. Gives them the oppertunity to take Star Trek anywhere they please. And maybe  avoid the wussification that set in after the original series was over. Making for more exciting, less touchy/feely, stories.    The bad.  There really isn`t much story to be had in this film. Mostly they run around and scream a lot.    The stupid.  Having Kirk go from a smart mouth cadet (on report for conduct unbecoming no less) to starship captain in one day isn`t even a joke.  It could only be discribed as an adolescent fantasy. A very immature fantasy at that. \\"Hey kid! We are really short on officers  this week. Wanna command a starship? On the job traning! No experience, brains, or common sense needed!\\"  This is about the same as pulling a cadet out of the Naval Academy and putting him in command of an aircraft carrier. I don`t care  what alternate universe you live in, it just isn`t going to happen.    The hope?  Ok. Now that they have this....whatever you want to call it...out of the way, where do they go from here? The current setup leaves  lots of potental for some good stories to come. Assuming that they have not managed to completely kill off the franchise with this  film.
0307269981|4.0|The second novel in Larsson's trilogy is much more exciting than the first, the characters that we have come to know are still the ones we love, and the new ones are fascinating as well.  Despite all that, the ending had some improbable events (mostly people being in the right place in the right time) that prevents me from giving this five stars.  Regardless, I loved the book and am eagerly looking forward to the third.  Read these books in order for maximum enjoyment.

B002FRNCG0|3.0|I stumbled onto RIOT! by Paramore earlier this year and was just blown away by the energy of the songs.  When Brand New Eyes came out I bought it without previewing and was instantly disappointed.  However, the more I listen to it the more I like it on it's own.  Still not as good as RIOT!, but comparing one album to the next cannot always be a good test.  Keep it up.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Thanks all for taking the time to review Blokus.  'was searching for a game that would be fun for the whole family (to entice me to sit down and play games with the kids more often) and this game is great!  I LOVE that there are few rules so we don't have to read/remind ourselves of the rules each time we sit down, yet its strategic and educational (spatially).  Even my 4 yr-old caught on right away how to touch in the corners and the order---blue, red, yellow then green.  I laugh because I try and be SO strategic but my 6 and 8 yr old boys end up winning anyway.  FUN game!  And durable too, as long as you keep close tabs on all of the pieces (21 of each pretty jewel-like color), this game should last for YEARS.  I cannot think of anything that I'd change.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|Well, I got tired of waiting for an uncensored version so I went ahead and purchased.  I've listened to the album maybe a dozen times so here's my objective review on it and Lady Ga Ga in general:    This album is definitely \\"darker\\" and heavier than the first.  Very typical of artisits though.  The first album comes out and they're excited and on top of the world.  By the time #2 rolls around, they've been slammed by the media, their privacy has vanished, and they've started to experience the dark side of the entertainment world.  So for that I can't fault her.    The beats - Well, they're pretty good.  Not great.  I love Ga Ga and am a huge fan.  But if you're looking for purely a dance/club album - eh, there's better out there. I'm not a fan of reprieves in the middle of songs and this album is heavy on the reprieves.  The songs build slowly and 1 minute into some of the songs, the beat is completely different than it started out.    The lyrics - Typical Ga Ga, the lyrics are deep, all over the map, and sometimes don't make a lot of sense.  The lyrics for Teeth are a tad wierd.  Pretty heavy for a dance/pop album.     The songs - By FAR, the highlight of the album for me is \\"Bad Romance.\\"  It's a really great song with catchy beat and lyrics that will be stuck in your head for days.      I liked all the songs except for Speechless.  I love ballads when the artist has powerful, expressive and extremely gifted vocals.  I don't feel Ga Ga has this.  She has a catchy, snappy night club voice - dark and smoky, maybe a bit dirty and sexy.  Not enough pipes to carry what's supposed to be a moving ballad.  Sorry but it was painful to try to make it through the song.  Lots of folks seem to love it though, so maybe it's just me :-)    Teeth - Oh boy, wow.  I don't know what to think or say about this song yet.  The beat is a heavy tribal drum beat that makes you feel like you're about to see someone's head chopped off and hung up on a stake.  The lyrics are bizarre \\"Take abite of my bad girl meat.\\"  The sound of the vocals are very country sounding.  I expect the singer to be wearing a cowboy hat and doing a line dance.  Overall, the song is intriguing and a fun listen, but definitely a mish/mash of sounds.  I'm not sure what she is going for here???    Dance In The Dark - A great song that reminds me very much of Madonna and Manic Monday.  In fact, a couple of the songs have a sort of \\"Madonna\\" sound and feel to them.  During Monster, I expect Madonna to break out with Vogue any minute.    And the album cover!  The one pictured here is fine.  Cute, whatever.  The alternate cover has Ga Ga looking like the dead and damned Japanese woman brutally murdered on the \\"Grudge\\" movie series complete with stringy black hair over the face and eye makeup pouring down her cheek.  Way too dark and disturbing for what is supposed to be a catchy dance/pop album.  The album isn't grunge rock, so why produce a grunge cover?    Ok, so overall I guess I rate this Album a B or possibly B+.  Definitely worth buying if you love Ga Ga, as I do.  But the album is very different from The Fame, so if that's what you're expecting, you might be disappointed. The Fame was hoppy, cheery, and light.  This is much darker.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|King was truly at his best when he wroten this novel. Instead of predetermining the whole plot, he lt the story grow and take its natural course on its own accord.  Furthermore, he often found the line and deliberately crosse it.  I admire and respect King for writing something so true and so original.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Megadeth already showed a sign of improvement on United Abominations which were arguably their greatest albums since Countdown To Extinction. They were experimenting with a more progressive sound on Cryptic Writings and Youthanasia than went to for a more industrial rock sound on Risk which a lot of fans disliked and I didn't think was that great either. The World Needs A Hero finally took them back to their earlier, heavier metal roots but didn't go back to their thrash roots until 2004's The System Has Failed. Megadeth's follow up to United Abominations more than lives up to it. Endgame is much heavier and thrashier than their last several albums and their best effort since Rust In Peace. The songwriting is excellent which is mostly on political themes and a lot like United Abominations lyrically. Guitar riffs and solos are some of Dave Mustaine's best in years. Endgame is an instant classic in thrash metal and if you were disappointed by their last few albums than try Endgame.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|There isn't a lot that I can say that hasn't already been said.  This is an excellent expose of the \\"food\\" industry in this country - the corruption, the utter denigration of our nation's farmers, disregard for the long-term implications of our methods to the environment and to our overall health - yet the film manages to be hopeful as well.  I am considering buying dvds for everyone on my Christmas gift list this year - it is that important of a film.<br /><br />For those who watched but did not view the deleted scenes, I would highly encourage you to do so.  Who says there is no longer a need for unions in this country?  I went to buying almost exclusively organic after reading Fast Food Nation.  I'm on a tight budget but my health and that of my children is of primary concern.<br /><br />I am 52 years old and I can well recall as a small child in the 60's when my grandmother (my grandparents were dairy farmers and planted primarily soy beans) told me that the government told them what to plant.  What has evolved has been a long time coming.  We shouldn't close our eyes any longer.

B001SGEUNI|3.0|I saw Halestorm open up for Heaven and Hell(aka Black Sabbath) at the House of Blues in Atlantic City and picked up their CD their. They played their songs quite a bit heavier in concert and I think that they sounded better that way. All in all a talented band that put on a great show. They should try to expand on the lyrics on their next CD. I think women will like this CD more than men. There is too much love/heartbreak/I hate you songs on this CD for my liking. In fact I gave it to my ex girlfriend. I wonder if she is smart enough to read between the lines and figure out why? LOL!
B002VECM36|4.0|Co-produced by the Wachowski Brothers (boy, these guys just like Japanese mythos) of the Matrix fame and with a screenplay written by Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski (one of my favorite writers) I knew I just had to give \\"NINJA ASSASSIN\\" a look. Being a martial arts action fan, I know what I am talking about when it comes to high-flying action, moody Asian plot elements and mysticism. Director James Mcteigue's film is a lot of fun and provides some needed action `junk' for martial arts fans and it is a fair attempt at creating a new martial arts hero.<br /><br />Raizo (Korean actor Jeong \\"Rain\\" Ji-Hoon) is a deadly assassin who was kidnapped as a child to be raised and trained by the Ozunu Ninja Clan that is also known as the Black Sand Clan; the existence of this secret group of assassins is considered to be a myth. Following the execution of his childhood friend by his own clan, Raizo has severed all ties with the Ozunu and goes into hiding. He resurfaces some years later seeking revenge on the clan's leader (Sho Kosugi) that takes him on a path that crosses with a young Europol agent named Mika (Naomie Harris) who is investigating the money linked to political murders and is in turn linked to the supposed mythic Ozunu Clan. Now, Raizo must confront his former brothers and to finally find redemption for the death of his childhood friend.<br /><br />The plot in \\"Ninja Assassin\\" isn't very special, it is your usual revenge flick that touches on the themes of redemption, regret and finally fulfillment of one's destiny. However, what makes it somewhat engaging is the fact that the film has that Japanese flavor and carries enough of the style that made Asian movies successful in the martial arts genre. The screenplay gives some good characterization in the part of the lead character and focuses on his development as young student and finally a man. Raizo's past is shown in the form of flashbacks, and writers Michael Sand and J. Michael Straczynski (he rewrote the script) manages to make a compelling character out of Raizo. From childhood, he has been tortured both mentally and physically by Lord Ozunu (nicely portrayed by Sho Kosugi) that proved to be his own rite of passage. His friendship with Kiriko (Kylie Goldstein) proves to be anchor within the walls of the Ozunu and his rivalry with another student Takeshi (Rick Yune) for the leadership of the clan proved to be his goal at first. Things change, and the script brings the exposition that the right woman can indeed change a man for the better, this is indeed a fact.<br /><br />Alright, one isn't exactly here for an inventive plot, martial arts action films usually soar because of the exciting fights and outrageous stunts; in this regard \\"Ninja Assassin\\" doesn't disappoint. Actor Jeong Ji-Hoon does have the charisma of a young ninja warrior and he does move gracefully during the fights. The film is full of style and very cool macho posturing; this is after all, still a Hollywood flick so count on the usual extreme close-ups, tricks with CGI, and a lot of zooming in and outs that take us right in the middle of the action. The fight choreography is very good, and looks very spiffy. It is cool but Hollywood didn't know when to stop and the scenes do become rather bombastic at times, that it came dangerously close to becoming \\"cartoonish\\". Ninja's are assassins that rely on stealth and the shadows to get to their objective, while the film does have those qualities, it doesn't feel any different than other martial arts films done by Hollywood. This movie would have done better with a more restrained style, but it does have its moments. The fights are long and very bloody; I liked the fights that occurred in the police safe house and the final fight with Sho Kosugi proved very exciting. It was such a thrill to see an older Kosugi show that he still has the stuff.<br /><br />The film also has a significant amount of gore and loads of blood. I was happy to see the gore and massive amounts of blood but after awhile the CGI blood effects started to wear thin. I know the effects are probably done in a manner to pay homage to Japanese arterial sprays effects but it would've been better if it used the old-fashioned red-ink. The film also uses some prosthetics enhanced with the CGI blood, the results are a little uneven as the quality of the effects swing from good to just plain unnecessary.<br /><br />\\"Ninja Assassin\\" has a fair share of supporting characters and while they did manage to get things going for Raizo, I am rather undecided whether they were necessary or not. Sure, Mika had her moments and actress Naomie Harris is nice to look at, but what is up with sidekicks? Hollywood still has little faith on the lead character to pull it off. Her superior Maslow (played by Ben Miles) provides some humor but this is where the dialogue resorts to becoming too obligatory, and the supporting characters do get in the way of the action.<br /><br />\\"Ninja Assassin\\" is a fun action movie to watch. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the way the fights were spaced out and if one is looking for balls-to-walls action then this film will not disappoint. Sometimes, we need a fun martial arts film and \\"Ninja Assassin\\" may just fulfill the needs of the action junkie. The CGI blood effects may prove to be a tad excessive at times, that I was a little turned off but I managed to look past it because the screenplay does manage to make Raizo an interesting character. The film would have been better if it avoided the stereotypical sidekick affair and instead focused on the conflict between Raizo and Lord Ozunu, but hey, this is a Hollywood flick, so if you want real authentic ninja mood and action, turn your eyes to Japan.<br /><br />Recommended!

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The Snow White on Blu-Ray looks fantastic.  A remastering of a classic... not much to say if you've seen Snow White.  I love that it comes with a DVD copy as well.  This is great so that you can play on the DVD player in the car for the kids, while still having blu-ray quality at home.  Definitely worth adding to your movie collection.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Before I watch movies, I come to the Amazon.com website and explore the various reviews while trying to avoid any spoilers to get an idea of what people and critics think.  However, I do form my own opinion as I have treasured movies that critics hated and thought some critically acclaimed movies as the most boring, daudling films I've ever seen in my life.    I just finished watching Orphan and I tell you what, I half expect to see that \\"child's\\" evil face staring at me from the top of the stairs.  Wow, what a job Isabelle Fuhrman did as the \\"child\\".  I agree her performance is oscar worthy.      Ok, so the pace was slow (especially at first!) but this is a psychological suspense thriller and watching this actress portray a child that was one side articulate, intelligent, and caring and the other side pure sadistic, manipulative, and violent evil was fascinating.  Also, the movie was meant to be slow but with the increasing notion of impending doom and terror coming at the climax, which is what happened.  For those who favor movies with a lot of action and gore and constant slam bang terror, this isn't the movie for you.      I perhaps though feel a bit idiotic as it seems many saw coming the twist at the end coming.  I didn't and I like it when a movie gives me a surprise.  That's an instant star and this one didn't dissapoint.  I did though think wow when the evil Esther threatened her sibling in a very concise, absolutely no doubt what was on her mind, expressed evil thought. It did make me stop for a moment and wonder... Then I let it go and the twist came and it was a big OKAY, I GET IT!!    The actors in this movie were all great, even the naive as I'll get out father/husband portrayed convincingly by Peter Sarsgaard.  If anyone was going to get it, I could see it coming for him in the end.  Yikes, wake up man!  It was wrenching seeing no one believing the mother character played by Vera Farmiga.  That role must have been draining for her-the anguish is so well executed.  In the end though, atleast in this case, mother knows best and don't mess with the children! The child actors and CCH Pounder also were great.    It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that sent chills down my spine and made me a bit jumpy after it ended.      To the director and actors-excellent picture!!    Sincerely,  William
B0026P3G12|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my 85 year old father who loves all things Scottish. Not a fan of day time television, he had never heard Susan sing.  He said this is the worst rendition of Amazing Grace he has ever heard, but the rest of the songs are pure perfection.
0307454541|3.0|Stieg Larsson has created an interesting story with an intricate plot.  He does an admirable job of juggling story lines, but he does so at the expense of character development and creates some implausible scenarios along the way.<br /><br />Michael Blomkvist is a journalist who has been framed for libel.  After being found guilty he is sentenced to 90 days in prison (Sweden must have tough libel laws!).  Shortly after being sentenced, he is approached by the patriarch of a wealthy family and asked to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, who vanished almost 40 years earlier.  In the process of solving the mystery, he teams up with Lisbeth Salander, an investigator and computer hacker extraordinaire.<br /><br />The meticulous process by which Blomkvist and Salander sift through the evidence makes for compelling reading.  Larsson's plot has a lot of moving parts but he manages to keep it all together.  Unfortunately, with all the focus on  plot, there is very little character development and it is sometimes hard to understand what makes Blomkvist tick.  There are also implausibilities that are impossible to overlook.  Salander has every reason to mistrust men, but when she first meets Blomkvist, she allows him to waltz into her apartment, no questions asked.  Blomkvist's daughter--who is about the same age as Harriet at the time she disappeared--appears to exist solely to decipher a clue involving an obscure bible reference.  Otherwise, Blomkvist apparently never thinks of her.<br /><br />This book was a page turner for me, despite the frequent need to suspend disbelief.  And Larsson attempts to call attention to the issue of violence against women by citing statistics about the prevalence of the problem in Sweden.  However, the book itself contains more than a few depictions and accounts of over-the-top violence against women.  I think reasonable minds can differ on whether the book itself furthers the author's goals.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|You know, it's funny.  I've said, in the past, that I hate movies based on things, but when I look at the movies I've watched over the last ten years, the vast majority of them have been based on something.  So be it, then.  Maybe I just like to risk causing myself unreasonable pain and suffering.    Fortunately, I didn't find myself experiencing such unreasonable suffering with Abrams' remake of Star Trek, though I couldn't say I really enjoyed it either.    This movie did a lot of things right, which is more than I can say for most movies based on things, so before I get into the gripes, let me tell you what it got right.    First, there are scenes of people flying through space in starships.  Their technology is mostly workable and realistically-portrayed, with the exception of one scene of a voice-recognition program that apparently can't penetrate an accent.  Most of the character portrayals are dead-on and believable, and someone in red armor dies at one point.  There's a plot involving time travel that needs to be resolved, and James Kirk handles the no-win test in the same way we heard about during previous Star Trek movies.    That may seem like a lot of things to get right, to the point where the movie should deserve a high grade, but I'm afraid that it got quite a few things wrong as well.  Most people who've never heard of Star Trek before won't notice most of these, but then, those people are probably in comas or hiding under rocks, and won't notice this movie either, so here goes.    First, this movie is a movie about war, and the Federation is depicted as an armada, yet, without the strict, military discipline that was previously Star Trek's defining characteristic.  This is a complete reversal on nearly every level.  What made classic Star Trek stand out from every other science fiction series before and since then was that in Star Trek, the characters didn't need to fight everything they came across.  Most of the time, the solution could be arrivedat peacefully, and frequently, it was just a matter of thinking about the problem a certain way.  Furthermore, military discipline was the overall mood of everything Star Trek; which differentiated it from Star Wars, where there was little or no discipline among the heroes.    Because of that, this movie is basically what the Star Wars prequels should have been.  It has the right mood, feel and genre to be another Star Wars movie, and fans of Star Wars will probably enjoy it as well.  However, it doesn't have the sense of peace that Star Trek radiated.  In fact, most of the movie is spent in mindless fighting.    Still, that's something that most other Star Trek movies also got wrong, so I won't come down on the movie too hard for that.    Secondly, in this movie, Mister Spock is fiery and emotional, and so is James Kirk.  Neither of them shows any signs of maturity or responsibility, and that makes many of their interactions painful to watch.  Showing Starfleet officers as young people can work as long as they act mature, but removing their maturity carries all the feeling of a bratty toddler aiming a phaser at your head.  These are not the kind of people you want to trust the fate of the Earth to, and no.  That's not a good thing.    Unfortunately, when robbed of his logic and self-control, Mister Spock becomes an abrasive, selfish, arrogant jerk; easily infuriated by the people around him.  There's nothing left of the Spock seen in previous films and episodes.  Just the fact that Spock seems to be the most emotional member of the crew should have told Abrams that he was on the wrong track in this respect, though.  Kirk, in turn, when he stops acting calm and composed, comes off as a hyper, overeager, self-centered and overconfident fool with a tendency to throw himself on women, and hope they give him the chance to take advantage of them.  The idea of him being in control of the Enterprise is more of a crime than a joy in that state.  In fact, at every stage, Abrams seemed determined to bring out and exaggerate the worst qualities of each of the two main characters, or even fabricate new ones, which does nothing to inspire or delight those who originally looked to Star Trek for hope that the future would be filled with maturity, peace, and intelligent thought.    I should also mention here that the plot of trying to rewrite canon Star Trek into a new, less-mature, less-likable timeline is a rotten thing to do, and I refuse to accept it, because I enjoyed the first Star Trek series' so much, and this so little, but it doesn't make a huge impact on me, because, as I said, my mind refuses to accept it.    On a much more minor note, I should say that given how far in the future this apparently takes place, I was disappointed with the appearance of the Enterprise engine room.  Every other part of the ship seems nice and spiffy, but the engine room looks like a beer brewery, and there's no good reason for that.  Antimatter fusion definitely does not make use of water as a coolant, nor are huge, bulky water tubes needed to keep the engines going.    The depictions of Earth and Vulcan are both nearly unforgivable.  For starters, the vulcans are shown to have prejudice against Spock, despite their logic, which is entirely different from the way things originally were; probably intended to make me hate the planet Vulcan, so I wouldn't mind so much, when Abrams decided to blow it up later on.  However, as much as Abrams made me hate Vulcan, he made me hate Earth a lot more.  His depictions of Earth contained no scenes of good people living peacefully.  Nearly every scene involved some kind of war, violence or sex; sometimes more than one of those things.  How am I supposed to root for the good guys if they absolutely refuse to be good?  Honestly, as much of a psychopath as the bad guy was, he at least seemed to take his actions seriously, to the point where I really would have rather just let him win.    So having said all this, why didn't I rate the movie lower?  Well, the characters of Uhura, Mccoy, Chekov and Sulu were all very faithfully depicted.  Scotty was a little much, but it was nice to see Leonard Nimoy again, if only as a guest chatacter.  It also shouldn't be said that I can't appreciate a good action sequence or some nice dialogue, and the story isn't a bad one.  As I said, it's just not Star Trek.    So in the end; no.  This movie didn't cause me unreasonable pain and suffering; just the moderate kind.  I didn't find it enjoyable, I wouldn't watch it again, and I certainly wouldn't watch a sequel to it, but in terms of what it gets right and wrong, this movie is a middle-of-the-road kind of experience.  It's average, so average is the grade that I'll give it, in spite of my personal disappointment over the opportunities they wasted.

B002RKXO6S|1.0|Every time I hear Bon Jovi is releasing another new album, I cringe, yet I always end up downloading it, giving it a shot.  As is the case with their previous 3 albums or so, this is absolutely dreadful, almost tarnishing the Bon Jovi name.  They honestly should have given up recording new music 10 years ago, just like Poison did.  If they want to tour the country, I'm all for it.  Play the favorites, and keep it at that.  But no, they insist on recording new music, and each album just continues to get worse and worse.<br /><br />I grew up with Bon Jovi.  I was born in the 70's, so in their prime in the 80's, Bon Jovi was one of the best in the biz.  They even continued their greatness into the mid 90's, with the Keep the Faith album, which was excellent.  Everything they've done in the 2000's has been forgettable, and their last 2 albums especially, have been downright awful.
B0026P3G12|5.0|There are not enough words to say how wonderful I think this CD is except I can't wait until her next one. To me this was total perfection.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|My college-age kid was crazy about this short film and was convinced I would love it. Always a red flag for an parent-type adult, since I don't want to hurt his feelings by disliking his favorite show.<br /><br />But I can't say I was crazy about Dr. Horrible.<br /><br />As a semi-realistic, semi-parody of the superhero, science fiction and musical theater genres, Dr. Horrible did have potential. Dr. Horrible is a regular guy who is a mad scientist at war with his nemesis, Captain Hammer, for the heart of the lovely Penny. Though super-smart and super-powerful, the characters act out the nerd-jock emotional spectrum. Which could have been funny if developed more. But the songs, at least at first hearing, were not memorable, at least to me. My kid, on the other hand, sings them all the time. The plot is silly and light, then suddenly and strangely gets heavy and brooding right at the end.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible was evidently cobbled together during the recent Hollywood writer's strike. It was thrown together in a short time, and it shows. The story has holes, the music needs polishing and the characters need fleshing out. It's a work of energy and fun, but seems to have been made less for the viewer than for the actors and crew. I personally found Neil Patrick Harris to be a bit full of himself for my taste, which didn't help my overall impression of the film. The extras seemed to be the actors and directors congratulating themselves for being clever. Hmm.<br /><br />Or maybe I'm just an old fart who doesn't appreciate humor that \\"hits\\" late teens and twenty-somethings. YMMV. AT the end of the day, I'm glad I watched it, if only to see how out of synch I am with my kid's generation.

Each song complimented the next perfectly and if you hear one of those songs on the radio now, when it ends, your mind wants to hear the \\"next\\" song, and when some other band comes on, you're disappointed.<br /><br />Oasis' \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory)\\" is one of those records.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan you have a wonderful voice and a personality to match.  I understand that you had a lot to do with this Album and it shows in the diversity of music that you choose.  That said, Sony is having difficulties trying to create who you should be.  Unfortunately you dont fit any of their molds.  That you dont fit their molds is wonderful.    I am so glad I have this album and will add many of the songs to my playlist. That said, I cannot believe that Sony did not make more of the arrangements.  The songs she picked were amazing, her voice can do amazing things, but the arrangements and instrumental backups just lacked luster.  How Great Thou Art just was flat as was silent night.  Your arrangers need to get a life.    It is amazing that the music industry cannot figure someone like Susan out. You listen to Wild Horse and it is amazing,  I have a dream voice great backup not so great.    Listen up Sony,  We want more Susan Boyles who actually have talent, so put more of your money into backing her up and she will make you a fortune.
B002VKE0XA|1.0|I honestly felt like a foreclosure victim once the credits begin to roll. I felt a disgust, then an anger at Paramount for basically jipping me out of my money to see this garbage. Allow me explain:    1) Incredibly dull. The first 45min are a complete and utter waste of time. The audience is treated to watching a young couple argue, eat cereal, brush their teeth, and watch a Ouija board burn.     2) Too lazy to even make it look like the \\"mockumentary\\" it's tries to be. For example, a psychic visits the house and the first conversation between himself and the couple is shamelessly edited. I thought this was supposed to be \\"found\\" footage.    3) Scary? Absolutely not. It's about as scary as watching a handful of cute puppies playing with fluffy kittens. It reduces the audience to cheap parlor-house tricks: slamming doors, broken glass, and loud banging noises- yes- the kind of tripe you'll find at your local neighborhood haunted house, although this time, you'll be paying a lot more to see it.    Paramount honestly should've given everyone who went to see this tripe a complimentary gallon of vaseline - because that's how much you'll need to survive the relentless gangbang the studio gives the viewing public. I haven't the slightest doubt hundreds of interns and temp workers were hired for the sole purposes of promoting this film through the internet - targeting younger audiences through facebook, twitter and other social networking sites. It really was disgusting.    LOL. Nice try with selling this DVD. I hope someone buys every copy in circulation only to return them after watching 10 minutes of this heaping sack of excrement.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I can only echo the disappointment of this CD that many others have stated. The only things I can add is that the producers and coaches need to simply let Susan Boyle be her dynamic self and let her sing in her own way. All the music from her is now more subdued and tame. Maybe they thought it sounded more refined, but all it did was muffle a terrific voice.<br /><br />From what I have read on line about all this, it tells me that the public wants the real and natural Susan Boyle, not a watered down production of some producer. Most have said they can only hope the next CD will be different. And if they do not let her be herself, then I believe that all but the die-hard fans will no longer support her. I for one want the Susan Boyle that belted out and without reservation, \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" when I first saw the video from BGT.<br /><br />I will be rooting for Susan in hopes either the producers will read these reviews and back off, or Susan will stand up to them and demand to sing the way she was meant to sing.<br /><br />My star rating is 5 stars for Susan because her voice still shines through and 1 star for the CD. Hence, the 3 star rating.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This album is simply a masterpiece. I don't know much about music, I mean I don't play any instrument so I can't speak with all the terminology or analyze every single music note in their songs, BUT, I've been a huge fan of Rammstein for a long time. Their music has never disappointed me before, but I have to admit that some of theirs songs or discs are better than others, and this disc is one of their best (Mutter is excellent too). Their music is heavier, but they still keep that sound that characterizes them. This time they didn't experimented as much as in their two previous albums. Only their music gives me an energy that I can't find nowhere else, is like a healthy drug. And about the lyrics, they are typical of them and it still makes me laugh that a lot of people get all alarmed about them, it's only music! Long live Rammstein! This album is a must, so don't hesitate and buy it.

This performance is a different approach to the Goldberg....less percussive,smoother, more nuanced perhaps...all things considered, while I still enjoy the Gould ( and listen to it often)  I find this version more pleasing to my ear....the  performer has stepped aside to reveal the  wonders that are Bach....a wonderful performance that should be in any music lovers collection.

B002MW50KO|1.0|I could listen to only five of the tracks before being overcome with nausea. These are awful songs, sung and played awfully.  It sounds like it was put together in little more than the time it takes to play it.  Everyone is going through the motions.  Dylan brings no new insight to the songs.  Some of the arrangements, especially \\"The First Noel,\\" are sickeningly sweet, even for an Xmas album.  I do not understand Bob Dylan.  Is he so hard up for attention that he'd do this kind of sell out record?  I've long believed that Dylan's work over the last 25 years or so is so bad, so desultory, that it almost obscures the magnificence and transcendence of his early, groundbreaking stuff.  But this is by far the worst.  No socially redeeming value whatsoever.  Straight to the garbage heap for this one!

Boring stuff : one slight change at a time, no creativity involved... so studios outsource \\"tweens\\" to cheap labor countries.<br /><br />Such as North Korea, where the author had to sojourn a few months to monitor the process.<br /><br />\\"Pyongyang\\" is a graphic novel depicting the tweens between two flights.<br /><br />Don't expect investigative journalism deep inside the country. \\"Pyongyang\\" is more the story of a failure to really enter North Korea.<br /><br />Don't expect tales of hunger and misery. \\"Pyongyang\\" is more the story of a slice of melon and isolation.<br /><br />That should be boring stuff : one slight change at a time, no creativity involved (absurd acts of subversion set aside)... but it's not. Image by image, Guy Delisle traps the reader into a Kafkaesque / Orwellian routine. And unlike Dino Buzzati's \\"[[ASIN:1567923046 The Tartar Steppe]]\\", or \\"[[ASIN:0918348366 The Great Walls of Samaris (Stories of the fantastic)]]\\" (by Schuiten and Peeters)*, that's not fiction : only a simple and honest testimony.<br /><br />* Buzzati for the rhythm and suspended time, Schuiten-Peeters for the architectural, theatrical, and somehow absurd journey.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|While Amazon and People magazine gave this movie a bad review, I can honestly say that this movie had my husband and I holding on to our seats, and we thought that this was a great movie.<br />I love horror movies and thrillers, yet horror movies never scare me, however, this scared me, why? because....it could happen!! The special effects were excellent. You can't rely on other peoples' views, watch it and then decide for yourself.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|Never buy this movie, or even see it, or rent it! This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is sad, there are about 2 funny lines, and all the characters are weirdos. Mothers, if you are thinking of letting your kids watch this, don't unless they are at least over 8 or 9! I mean really, in the first 5 minutes I hated this movie, a tip for the producers, Don't start out with the saddest part of the movie. If there are any sad parts they're supposed to be at the end. But don't worry, there's more than one sad part. I was really looking forward to this movie because it looked funny and was made by Disney, WRONG! To think I almost bought this movie. Never buy IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  One last comment, dogs flying in planes shooting machine guns, WHAT is up with that!
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies. I can watch it multiple times and be smiling the whole time.  If you are looking for something serious with tons of special effects, forget it....but if you are like me and just want to be entertained and walk away feeling like you did in the 70's, then this is for you.  Is the singing perfect?  NO.  Meryl and Amanda do a great job, but others not so great. YET who cares?  I am not looking for perfection. It is real with a touch of great imagination.  Not to mention the wonderful scenery, which is worth seeing just for it alone. I enjoyed the way the songs wove into a story that worked, almost like an opera. I also liked the closing scene with some of the original ABBA (think he was also playing the piano on the water scene where women all jumped in) and Meryl Streep all done up and asking \\"if we want it\\".....GREAT FUN and GREAT ENTERTAINMENT.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I purchased this album today and I couldn't be more pleased with it. This is not my norm for music but her voice is so beautiful that I will have her added to my musical preferences from here on. I initially purchased it for \\"I dreamed a dream\\" and couldn't imagine any other song would come close to that one, but I was wrong. All the songs are beautiful but my absolute favorites are \\"Wild Horses\\" \\"Cry me a River\\" \\"You'll see\\" and \\"How great thou art\\"  I wish her all the luck in the world for a continued success for years to come. I already look foward to another CD and to one day see her perform live.
0679721037|5.0|Our sonds teacher made him read this. He actually talked about it quite a bit and seemed to really learn alot about it's history.<br /><br />I was pretty impressed that a 15 year old actually found it intruiging enough to WANT to read it. KUDOS to the required reading for school. Wish I could have found it used, but ho hum.
0739340131|5.0|If you like Zombie stories this one is worth purchasing.  Different than the usual and pretty fun to listen to.
0765318741|3.0|Beware: while this book is 300+ pages long, only about 170 of those pages is the story, \\"I Am Legend.\\" What follows is a handful of short stories not related at all to the main story line. They are a collection of stories written by the same author. If I would have known this I probably would not have purchased this copy. However, the book \\"I Am Legend\\", while much different from the movie and much shorter than anticipated, was worth the read.
B0016OCUW0|4.0|I have never heard of Amon Amarth before, but after hearing one of their songs on Pandora I was very impressed. I took advantage of a $3 promotional code and picked up this album.    It is very hard, heavy, and fast; but it also has an impressive amount of depth. I can't speak of it in a technical sense, but if you enjoy the melodic death metal genre, this is a must have.
B0026P3G12|5.0|While this may not be everyones style of music...it is mine.  As many have said part of the thrill of Susan's album is that she is a REAL person...not some glitzy, created doll.  While they have dressed her up a little and given her a little polish...I am not too sure she is very comfortable with it. That said...I really liked the album.    My only complaint in in the mixing of the sound...the choir/chorus/orchestra in the back ground often drowns Susan out.  This is the fault of the production and has nothing to do with her voice.    I would love to hear her do a Christmas album and perhaps a Broadway one also.  She has that strong \\"STAGE\\" type voice and yet can sound as gentle as a whisper.  I love all types of music and would also like to hear her do some lighter things but if we buy this one...then hopefully she will do more and we can see if her talent will last or if she is just a flash in time.  I sincerely hope not.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|...get off the fence, and replace the DVD with this BluRay.  There are a lot of BluRays out there that don't look or sound that much better than their standard def counterparts.  This isn't one of them.  I've never seen such an incredible difference between a DVD and it's matching BluRay before, in either video or audio performance.  This is going to end up on a lot of A/V specialists \\"reference quality\\" lists before it's all said and done.    Obviously a terrific film, even if you're not a big fan of the TV series that spawned it.  If you ARE a fan, get this BluRay...right now.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|There is something about this CD full of unique indie songs that sweetly tugs at the memory and spirit. The sound of the group Beirut is like what one might imagine if you crossed a crew of gypsies with French bistro troubadours. The result is unlike any thing I have ever heard before. Their music is marbled with swirls of strings, horns, accordion,percussion sounding like tub thumping, all while above it floats the lead ropey tenor of Zach Condon, founder of Beirut. The lyrics and instruments especially in \\"Nantes\\" and \\"Sunday Smile\\" will transport you to the streets and cabarets of Paris in a bygone era. There is not one song which does not work it's magic on the listener. One feels as if you have taken a tour somewhere back through the crooked gallic alleys of time and you do not want it to end.  Anything that is able to do this is surely great art!
B002XSP16A|1.0|The downloaded MP3 version of I Dreamed a Dream is awful!.  The overall tonal quality is flat and there is occasional distortion that makes it sound like you are listening to the song under water.  Susan Boyle has a wonderful voice.  It's a shame the quality of her singing is lost in this recording.
B0026P3G12|5.0|If you want a nice calming CD where you can actually make out the words in the songs. By a NEW PERFORMER this is the CD to buy. Song 1 - 5 are Great. Daydream Believer is good. If you like the Monkee's version, you probably will be slightly disappointed.  I agree with some of the comments on How Great Thou Art and Amazing Grace, Up to the Mountan Silent Night somewhat drowned out by the backup singers. I love Who I Was Born To Be, Proud and The End of the World.  P.S Disregard at least 2 of the one star comments, most likely talent show rejects.
B002T45VX6|5.0|This is the first time I have bought a Shakira album and at this rate, it won't be the last. Some people say that she's not the \\"same Shakira\\" anymore. Well, maybe she is finally becoming comfortable with herself as an artist and/or is trying to broaden her fan base. Whatever she is thinking, she should keep it up. I love her album. If nothing else, buy it just for \\"Long Time\\".
0399213015|4.0|They aren't lying when they say 'miniature'. This thing is tiny. Maybe a little too small.  Plus my daughter ate the pages. Otherwise a good 'simple' book.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|First off, if you do have the first two season sets of \\"Rome\\" on DVD already, no real reason to upgrade. The extras are all the same with no changes and the picture, if a bit sharper, is about the same too.    But if you haven't gotten this series, this is a great way to start. This is Ancient Rome the HBO way, which means amazing detail to history while mixing in contemporary language, scattered with curses, bloody violence and (this is Rome, after all), constant nudity. The story revolves around two soldiers, Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Pullo (Ray Stevenson) who find themselves involved in the dramatic events of Rome. From Julius Ceasar crossing the Rubicon and becoming emperor to meeting Cleopatra, Ceasar's death and the war between Octavius and Rome, the two are in the midst of it all while handling thier own personal dramas. In the first season, Vorenus has no idea his wife had a child with another man while he was at war while Pullo's hard-drinking and violent ways get him into trouble.     The acting is terrific from the two leads, McKidd cool most of the time, which makes his bursts of incredible violence more notable. Pullo is funny as a man who'd go straight through anyone in his parth and sees no trouble killing. Ciaran Hinds gives Caesar a proud air that makes you understand why people were willing to follow him while James Purefoy plays Marc Antony as an arrogant blowhard who still manages to power his way through the ruling class. The best of the cast, however, is easily Polly Walker as the deliciously wicked Atia, a woman willing to do anything (Blackmail, murder and use her body however she wants) to get ahead in Roman society.     The show is wonderfully researched, bringing the era to life like never before and showcases some nice bits of history. The language may be contemporary but the producers do try to show how it really was. Cleopatra, for instance, is attractive but short and hardly the supermodel figure so many movies portray her as while Caesar's assaination is less a careful plot and more a near-disaster. There aren't many actual battle scenes shown due to budget but the fights we get are pretty brutal and bloody like it really was and the show is great illustrating the complex political games of the time.    Season two does suffer a bit as it was midway through production the producers learned they would only get 10 episodes and no third season. Thus, the stories feel more rushed as they try to fit in as much as they can. They do a good job with the battle over Antony and Cleopatra (which is far less than the epic romance most think) and bring it to as good a conclusion as they can. Through it all, the epic bromance between the two leads pulls you in as you get sucked into their lives, through thick and thin and care for their final fates.     The extras are good as there are multiple audio commentaries and features on putting the show together, as well as recreating the time. The best bonus is \\"All Roads Lead to Rome,\\" a great subtitle guide that explains many of the references, historical notes and more on the time, showing the amazing research that went into it all and you see how true to life it is.    It may have been short-lived but the series remains one of HBO's best efforts ever. Brilliantly acted and wonderful in detail, the show is a must-have for any history or drama buff to see in all its wild glory.
B001U887SI|3.0|I love the idea of crocs without all the holes with fleece liners for cold weather, however the sizing on these is very different from most crocs.  The length is shorter, but the width is much wider (and I usually prefer a wide shoe).  Otherwise, these are great.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|On her fourth album, Norah moves away from her recent affinity with country music, and embraces a bluesy, mid-tempo rock style reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt. Aside from \\"Chasing Pirates\\", the first hit single, my favorite track is the live version of \\"Strangers\\" (originally by the Kinks), found only on the \\"Deluxe\\" version of the CD.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I have been a Rihanna fan and watched her music evolve with great interest, this may be darker than recent efforts, but it is also heartfelt, poetic and has brilliant lyrics. We have to give her credit for allowing herself to grow in a music industry that has become so redundant. This is her strongest album to date with her strongest vocals yet!!!

0882709194|1.0|The text of this edition has been abridged, removing some of the strongest evidence Darwin had available for evolution by natural selection.  The \\"Special Introduction\\" by Ray Comfort is purest bilge . . . and you can save yourself some money by finding the PDF for free, online.  Read it only if you want to spend a diverting half-hour playing Name That Fallacy.  But then, pointing out the many errors in Comfort's \\"reasoning\\" is a little like shooting fish in a barrel.
0385504225|5.0|I was already a Dan Brown fan and so was eagerly awaiting The Lost Symbol. This book absolutely does not disappoint. It takes place over the course of about twelve hours, and through its pages, unfolds deep mystery after deep mystery. It has some great twists and turns, and keeps the suspense high the entire way through. I like that it also has an unusual format - there is the climax of the main story, but then the book allows you to keep unwrapping mysterious treasure after mysterious treasure for some time afterwards. I was truly sorry the book was finished. I felt like I had been given passage into a world of revelations that I wanted to continue, until I knew all there was to know. But that is not this book's job, that is now my own personal journey - to continue along the path that has been laid before me. And do so, I shall.<br /><br />I actually found the story very inspirational and illuminating in its message and it presented some concepts, chief amongst them Noetic science, that I intend to keep studying. It is one of those books that can and does change the way you see and interact with the world around you. Dan Brown, in my opinion, is a master at telling compelling stories and teaching you all manner of incredibly fascinating things along the way. His books, The Lost Symbol, included, are loaded with information about some of the most mysterious and enigmatic parts of our history and culture. He presents ancient knowledge and myth in a new light and gets you thinking. He ignites interest in the past, in art, books, secret societies, scientific concepts and weaves all of those aspects into thrilling stories that are truly `unputdownable'. His tales tap into our imaginations and curiosity about the world around us. He says he writes stories that he finds personally entertaining and if the author is captivated and enchanted with what they are writing, that will come through in their work, as it does in The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />There is nothing disappointing about this book, it is well paced, has great characters that are truly alive, and a mystery at its core that kept me completely enthralled. The Lost Symbol is highly engaging, thoroughly entertaining, and is most certainly time well spent. Let yourself be entertained and enlightened by this exciting novel. I hope it will grace the big screen in the not-too-distant future!<br /><br />Rai Aren, co-author of Secret of the Sandsbook, it is well paced, has great characters that are truly alive, and a mystery at its core that kept me completely enthralled.

B002MW50KO|4.0|And the other half is not so...maybe it's my personal take on it, but I get a kick out of his renditions of the more modern stuff.  O little town and silver bells and little drummer boy I wouldn't miss, though I do like them all a lot better than I do \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" which thankfully is missing here.  Many well-known songs, wonder how many he tried out to begin with?  Hope All the money (beyond production costs) goes to feeding the poor, Bob bless us everyone!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Got the CD today and listening to it as I write this. I love to be able her sing other than from a You Tube clip.  Great CD and her voice is wonderful.  It's going to stay in my car for a long time!  \\"Wild Horses\\" is the stand out on this CD.  It's a tribute to what really great lyrics have come from people like Jagger and Richardson.<br /><br />Go get 'em Susan!!
B002OB9KPE|4.0|For a band that has unashamedly composed prog epics of unmatched length, they leave no doubt at the start of this 77-minute epic that you're in for an epic of epic proportions....  ;-)<br /><br />The opening track starts with a small brass ensemble that transitions to an orchestral flourish before settling into what is essentially the overture for this grand work, introducing the listener to many of the musical themes that we'll hear again in various forms throughout the next hour and a quarter.<br /><br />In typical Transatlantic style, the recurring themes are catchy, sophisticated, and often turned inside-out to form new and interesting mind excursions.  Folks, this is great stuff!  It's probably one of my favorite progressive rock albums of the year (just behind the fantastic \\"Realms of Eternity\\" by Syzygy).  To any naysayers out there, all I can say is that you sound like a baseball fan who is disappointed that the star slugger on your favorite team belted the game-winning home run \\"only\\" 400 feet when you were expecting a 500-ft homer instead.  Get real, folks  -  this is some primo stuff.<br /><br />I like Roine Stolt's increased vocal duties this time around, and I feel like these are the best guitar lines he's laid down since the TFK \\"Stardust We Are\\" album.  I appreciate the fact that Portnoy is able to de-metalize his drum style for this band, and he really is impressive here.  Likewise, Trewavas has his best Transatlantic showing on this cd  -  his bass is thick, trebly and melodic, and his vocals are great.  Neal Morse is great here too  -  I love his vocals, and if he tends to drag the lyrics back to the edge of Christian music here and there, I'm fine with that.  I do believe that the work as a whole shows a nice balance between all four members; and while the message is certainly one that aspires to a higher plane, the listener is not hit over the head with it until (perhaps) the last song (which is still a great one!).<br /><br />Just a quick nod to the great cd artwork and liner notes  -  it's even kind of cool that they've been able to work their signature flying space zeppelin into the covers of all three studio albums now.  And kudos to the sound engineers for nice separation and mixing  -  some of the jams and prog workouts here are just fantastic, and made even more so by the production.<br /><br />The only thing that sort of bothered me (and this is a real nit, folks) is that by the end of the second song, I was pretty durn sure that the whirlwind blew everyone away! and I really did not need one more chorus or song about it to convince me...  I got it.  Really.  (Perhaps some of the other songs could have been shortened or edited a bit as well.)  But \\"wind\\" is the primary theme of this suite after all, and is integral to the metaphor of the overall message, so let's accept it and move on.<br /><br />I liked the second cd too, but not nearly as much.  I enjoy covers of songs that I've liked, so these are worthy  -  I think the combination of the two \\"I Need You\\" songs was clever.  \\"Spinning\\" is a fantastic song in the Flower Kings style, while the lyrics to \\"Lenny Johnson\\" just seemed a bit clumsy to me.  \\"Lending A Hand\\" is kind of a cool song in a late-60's spacey-psychedelic-prog style.  I'd probably give that disc alone a 3-1/2 star rating, which prohibits me from assigning the entire package 5 stars.<br /><br />So, please put away your lofty presuppositions about what this comeback cd from your favorite progressive rock band of the past decade SHOULD be, and let it wash (or blow?) over you for what it is  -  another great, thoughtful collage of masterful songwriting and performing from a one-of-a-kind band.  Worthy.<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 8.7/10;  Performance = 9.4/10;  Production = 9.5/10;  CD length = 10/10.<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 9.1  (\\"4-1/2 stars\\")r notes  -  it's even kind of cool that they've been able to work their signature flying space zeppelin into the covers of all three studio albums now.

0142403873|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this book!  She always asks for it at bedtime, and often during the day too.  My husband and I both enjoy reading it to her, and don't get tired of it like we do with some of her other books.  It's just the right length.  And the illustrations are lovely!  We'll soon be getting her more books by the same author.
B000005RMY|5.0|A little lesson in history: there are actually three different bands called the Sisters of Mercy, the only thing unifying them is a man named Andrew Eldritch.<br />This collection is perhaps the only digital document of the original, first Sisters of Mercy, a band that released a string of singles and EPs between 1980 and 1983, toured extensively (mostly in England and Germany) and built a reputation as one of the more rugged exemplars of an emerging post-punk sound that in hindsight people have chosen for better or worse to call goth. These were the songs we used to browse the 12 inch single bins of underground and indie record stores to find.  There were also a lot of bootleg concert recordings floating around, most of which are languishing, gathering dust in people's old cassette tape collections... perhaps someday one of those bootlegs will see digital.<br /><br />But for the curious, let it be clear: when you hear about Sisters of Mercy as one of the original early 80s post punk pioneers of the new, dark music... this is the band and these are the songs they are referring to, those long play releases starting in 1985.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I have been a Lady Gaga fan since hearing her first single.  She is beyond talented and I have much more respect for her because she actually writes all of her own music!  She is amazing on the piano and her voice is rich and just plain gorgeous!  This CD doesn't disappoint, and it shows a slightly softer side to Lady Gaga's musical ability as the aren't as many thumping dance tracks on this as there were on The Fame.  The only song I don't totally love is Dancer in the Dark.  Its a little too 80's pop for me.  I don't hate the song though...it's just not as good as the rest of the songs are.  If you liked The Fame, buy this CD!!!!  You'll LOVE it!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been anticipating this album since I first discovered Susan on YouTube.  The many tears that flowed everytime I heard her sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and the memories of a bullied childhood, (I am a gay man), the cruel people that I encountered in my life that made me shy and insecure.  I totally related to Susan especially when people in the audience began to make fun of her when she came on stage.  I was angered by those faces, the faces that reminded me so much of my teenage years.  But wow did she show them! After coming in second to the dance group \\"Diversity\\",( Major Blunder!), her emotional breakdown, I wondered could she handle this singing career? Well, I believe she can, especially since she comes from a big loving family and her strong devotion to God and his mother Mary, ( I also have the same devotions).  This will keep her grounded, about the album, I do like it quite a bit.  It's very personal and the song choices prove that.  Susan chose songs that she could relate to on a personal and religious level and that's awesome!  My favorites are her new rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", \\"Daydream Believer\\", \\"Proud\\", the new composition, \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" and \\"Silent Night\\".  I think \\"You'll See\\" should have been left only to Madonna, who sung it so passionately and vocally so strong it's hard to compete with, but I do understand Susan's reasoning for the song choice and how she vocally interpreted it.  \\"End of The World' is not a good showcase for her talents, her voice sounds strained and tired, but trust me I will grow to appreciate every rendition that is on this album.  I titled this \\"Just the Beginning\\" for I believe her next album will be stronger and she will have a new confidence.  I am so glad that it is \\"Selling Thru The Roof\\", because she deserves all the good things that come her way.  God Bless you Susan for you are a true testament of never giving up no matter what others say.  Your a true lady and thank you for the music!
B000AYELVU|4.0|I am a long time Marvel and X-Men fan.  I have not been impressed by the comic to movie conversion of these characters.  I like the movies as stand alone adventures.  I do not think the represent the series well, but they are fun to watch.  In all fairness, I have rarely been impressed by comic to movie, or book to movie, conversions.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Last night was the last viewing of This Is It in Ventura, Ca and I went one last time to see it again as I wanted to get a solid fix for my spirit until it is released for us to buy. I have tears as I write this because in the month that it was here I saw it 4 times and got a different experience each time I went. What a wonderful film we have been priviledged to see and I will treasure each scene in my mind as I wait for the DVD. By the way I am a 63 yr old woman who just happened to love Michael and looked forward to him growing old with us. We have lost a true artist and I am so sad that I cannot go and buy another ticket to see it on the big screen a few more times. And all of those people who worked with him. How awful this time must be for them. I will be thinking of them often and hope that they can go on with their careers with the knowledge that they were good enough for him so they should be able to get work in the business even if it will not be the same as the great show that they were going to be in. I am so sad.
B000057000|5.0|This is a new recording 20 years after the original one  as many examples in music we have better aspects and worse ones  The bad point is Franchesco di Giacomo voice, now is 20 years after  Understandme, In this record he is extraordinary, but in the original one he was unsurpased. The biggest diference is in trak 5 750000 ani. still the beauty and finesse voice but the power is gone, It means, no more DRAMATIC.  The music is top of the line, now with more electronic gear, but also the pace, the rithm is much more mature, is  totally a pleasure  EVALUATION: (each topic in points;  0-under, 1-standar, 2-over) 1) Voice-2, CD sound-1, Album Concept-2. Originality-2. Performance-2. Musical contruction-2, voice construction-1.  Totally One of a kind record that must have in any rock library.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this movie.  They justified all the completely wrong things in the movie to an alternate reality/time line.  As if having one character say that justifies completely rewriting the \\"history\\" of Star Trek.  I was not able to get connected to any of the characters.  It just went on an on.  Chekov didn't even show up till later in the original series.  He was much younger than the rest of the characters.  Did they just add him for the comic relief of his ridiculous Russian accent?  Wictor, Wictor - gag!  And the chase scene where a very young Kirk is racing his step dad's car is just stupid.  JJ Abrams should be embarrassed.  Not worth the time spent watching.
0307269981|5.0|I love the characters in this book. You want to know more about them. The main character Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist  and Lisbeth Salander, the hacker grab your attention. Especially, Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo. The story continues from the first book, although I admit the first book was more interesting to me, I enjoy this story immensely. I highly recommend this book and this author. The book keep your interest from the beginning. The plot is different , this time lisbeth is accused of a crime and larsson goes back into her life history.<br /><br />Excellent story and I highly recommend.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Well, I finally received this box set last week and I'm now up to The Beatles (The White Album).  This was a brilliant idea to remaster these masterpieces!!!  I have never heard the Beatles like this before.  The sound is so clear and much much better than the original recordings.  If you have the American versions of the Beatles records, then you'll know what an embarrassment they are with the false stereo.  An example of this is Roll Over Beethoven.  You can hear an echo on the American version.  Listen to this remastered version and it is clear as a bell, no echo, nothing just pure sound.  The entire Beatles catalogue is like this.      This box set includes all 13 studio albums and a double disc of the Past Masters Vol. I and II CDs.  Each CD has a mini-documentary at the end.  Just insert into your computer and watch.  There is an additional DVD of all the mini-documentaries as well.  This set was very well planned out to provide the fans with one brilliant Beatles set that will knock your socks off.    Each CD has been carefully remastered and packaged with a three-fold cover.  Each CD includes a booklet about the making of the album and historical notes.  Each booklet also includes pictures neer before seen in both color and black and white.  The Beatles (The hite Album) is really impressive.  They have made it exactly as the original LP vinyl release.  It is a four-fold fold out jacket.  This remaster also includes a booklet of historical notes and the making of the album along with the lyrics.  Do you remember the four individual pictures of the Beatles?  Well, in the fold out cover of this beautifully remastered work are the pictures.  Thic CD also includes a mini-poster of the original poster of the collage on one side and the lyrics to the songs on the other side.    The entire collection, not only individually packaged, is packaged as a whole with a shiny, black flip-top box with the words \\"The Beatles\\" centered in white.  Below is a picture of an appleto signify \\"Apple Records\\".      I have been totally blown away by this collection.  Once you hear these remastered works in true stereo, you'll never want to listen to the original CD again.  I have also ordered the mono box set which I will be picking up from the post office tomorrow.  I am quite sure that the mono box set, which does not have the last 3 Beatles albums, is just as brilliant as the stereo set.  The reason for the last 3 albums excluded is because they were not recorded in mono.    If you're a Beatles fan, this is one set that is a must.  If you want to replace your Beatles collection with a better sound, then this collection is for you.  This is one collection that I have to say is very much well worth the money.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|When is a movie more than a movie? When it can transcend the very genre it's in and becomes an event, something that can cause people to think, to talk, to debate, to embrace it so much you feel you need to see it again and again because you feel you missed something the other ten times you saw it.<br /><br />\\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films....all great event films. Add Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" to this list.<br /><br />As a lifelong fan of comic book superheroes, there are quite a few that i've taken to my heart: Superman, Spiderman, The Fantastic Four, X-Men,the Hulk, etc, etc. I've always loved Batman. Even through the numerous comics, which i still read to this day, the cartoons, even the campy 60s tv series, as well Tim Burton's great, dark reimagining of the mythos in the late 80s, Batman remains one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />What Nolan has created with \\"The Dark Knight\\" cant truly be put into a few, simple sentences. Impossible. This film is one of the few true definitions of a masterpiece. It's intelligent, cold, unrelenting, extremely dark and at times disturbing and it's these adjectives that, for me, make it perfect.<br /><br />In the brilliant \\"Batman Begins\\", Nolan dissected and broke down the origin of The DC Comics vigilante, giving us a glimpse of the very twisted, emotional elements that drove one man to assume the identity of a creature of the night. He presented this as a character study of a man, seemingly normal on the outside, with wealth, power, and influence, yet tortured, driven, disturbed, trying to find a way to unleash his demons upon those who live to choose to break the law and destroy the moral fabric of \\"society\\".<br /><br />In \\"The Dark Knight\\", we go a few levels further....into the very bowels of HELL. This time, Batman struggles not just with the questionable choices he has made to protect Gotham City, with many people divided over how they feel about his presence, he also must face a new criminal who spreads anarchy and uncontrolled chaos all over town, the Joker.<br /><br />Now, we all know much has been written and said about the late Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker....BUT HE'S SOOOO GODDAMN BRILLIANT!!!! This is the Joker the way he should be portrayed. As much as i loved Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's '89 film, hes a punk compared to what Ledger created. Ledger's Joker is cold, calculating evil in its purest form....a man so unfeeling, so depraved, so demonic...he doesnt commit crimes for reward, notoriety, or what we'd consider intimate pleasure; he does because he simply wants to, plain and simple. He sees the world as a place to be broken and manipulated, consequences be damned. Scary, aint it? Think of the killers of Columbine, or V-Tech, even the Unabomber. Even Satan. No conscience. Evil for evil. Ledger won a very deserved posthumous Oscar for his work.<br /><br />The great Christian Bale is the ultimate Batman for our time. Driven, dark, cold-blooded but not without a sense of honor. He digs deeper into the psychology of Bruce Wayne, creating a portrait of someone fighting a war he might never win, a war that creates more demons and more pain than he can stop, yet doesnt give in to the monsters he opposes. Bale and Ledger are magnificent together.<br /><br />As great as they are, its the supporting performances that help them shine. Overall, theres not a bad performance from anyone, AT ALL. Only the best caliber of actors dominate this film. Gary Oldman's Detective James Gordon is a picture of powerful moral conviction and simple passion as he stands by Batman in the fight against crime; Michael Caine's Alfred is the deep, fatherly, yet caring voice of no-nonsense reason to Wayne/Batman; Maggie Gyllenhall makes a more intense Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes; Morgan Freeman is dignity personified as Lucius Fox. Special mention should be made, though, for Aaron Eckhart, who plays D.A. Harvey Dent/Two Face. Like Batman and Gordon, he wants to wipe out crime in Gotham City, yet he suffers from a fatal flaw: he's idealistic. Its this flaw that the Joker will exploit and twist and ultimately damage, and it leads to Dent becoming Two Face, a scarred, deranged, hopeless man broken and twisted almost as much the Joker himself.<br /><br />There are no easy answers in this film, with its nihilistic view of good and evil and how sometimes, even good men can be pushed to their moral limits. Thats what i loved about this film. Nothing is simple, nothing is easy, and isnt that the way life is? Films about superheroes are a mixed breed: some are great, some not. I love the original Superman w/Christopher Reeve, and Spiderman, and Bryan Singer's X-Men, yet \\"Dark Knight\\" is, to me, the epic for our troubled times. Intelligent, huge, well written and acted. It's a film that in my opinion as a movie-goer, has a 70s style aesthetic that will remind you of the great crime epics of that period like Serpico, Godfather 1 and 2, and even modern ones like Goodfellas and The Departed. Director Christopher Nolan takes his place among the newest generation of filmmakers who dont treat their audiences like simple-minded children.

0064436063|5.0|A few years ago, I was in a production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL at my community's playhouse.  One Sunday evening after the matinee and before the evening performance, I stopped in a Barnes&Noble and decided to pick this book up.  It looked like a beautiful adaptation of a classic holiday story that had made my Christmases special for years.      I was not disappointed.    Just take a second now to look at the cover of this book.  Whether you have it in your hand, or you look at it on Amazon, just glance at it for a few seconds.  Do you see the intricate detail artist Dean Morrissey puts in his illustration?  The bricks on the wall, and shadow on Scrooge's face.  The snow on the pavement on the ground.  This intricate attention to detail is present throughout all of the illustrations.  They are gorgeous, and they bring vibrant life to Dickens' classic.    Now, for the treatment of Dickens' writing.  This book is abridged, but is marvelously done.  Many of the lines are Dickens' own, and all of the cuts come from lengthy descriptions that aren't essential to the story.  Dickens' overall tone and beautiful use of language are present in this book, and they make the tale of Scrooge and his redemption as inspiring as it's ever been.    This is a nice introduction if you've never read the Dickens original (though I can't imagine anyone hasn't).  However, if you have read it, this is a must-own if you value Scrooge and his ghosts as an essential part of the holiday season, as I do.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I, like millions of others, fell in love with Susan Boyle when she showed a cynical audience on BGT that small unassuming packages often include large gifts. It was not only her astounding gift as a singer, but also her personal story that captured our hearts.    Ms. Boyle's international debut on this CD reiterates all that her fans hoped for  -- a voice that is so pure and innocent, and a subdued passion that rings true. I am not a music critic, but a lover of great music from all genres.  Susan Boyle defies categorization.  She is capable of doing anything with her voice.  My choice for her, going forward, would be jazz and blues rather than show music.  I would like to see her get away from full and flourishing orchestration.  Her voice is her instrument, and her arrangements should be more spare.      Wild Horses and Proud are the standouts for me.  Carry on, Ms. Boyle.  You are a great gift to us all.

B0027BOL4G|3.0|The tenets of mass production have been praised and vilified for their effects on costs.  One camp lauds mass production for its ability to reduce costs and to place goods within the reach of the ordinary consumer.  Another camp criticizes mass production for its ability to hide costs rather than actually reduce them.  Of these two camps, Food, Inc. clearly falls in the latter one.  From a mutated chicken, to unsavory labor practices, to government policies run amok, Food, Inc. has one mission:  to lift the curtain on what is behind our hidden policy of cheap food.      Leaning on commentary from Eric Schlosser (author of [[ASIN:0060838582 Fast Food Nation]]) and Michael Pollan (author of [[ASIN:0143038583 The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals]]), Food, Inc. largely reiterates what these authors have already put into print.  At least for this reviewer, who read Pollan's book with gusto, there was nothing new here, and this was disappointing.  True, Food, Inc. challenges our labor and agricultural practices with sometimes brutal images, but all in all, it limits itself to retracing Pollan's steps.  In doing so, Food, Inc. merely provides a visual introduction to the characters and scenes Pollan already has described in vivid detail.      In some ways, this approach adds a visual layer of depth to Pollan's account of mass produced food in 21st Century America.  In the end, though, the message is still the same:  our policy of cheap food has consequences for society and the individual.  For those who are unaware of what these consequences are, Food, Inc. provides a thorough introduction and challenges you to do something about it.  For those who are familiar with Pollan's book, Food, Inc. is largely reiterative, but appreciably so.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I have been looking forward to the release of this album for weeks.  I was not disappointed as the 8 new songs from Lady GaGa are great.  The only issue is that Interscope/Universal/Streamline Records (whatever you wish to call them) only released the album in a censored version.  Streamline issued a statement on Twitter earlier this week (supposedly) offering an apology and stating there will be an explicit version, but what are those of us that have already bought the album supposed to do?  Buy it again?  I don't think so.  I can't believe GaGa let them do such a stunt after she was so adamant on having a stand alone edition so her fans wouldn't have to buy The Fame all over again.
B000VD5I94|3.0|Blu-ray version of Robo.     Not really much here, it's the original theatrical version.  Others have reviewed the movie itself, just wanted to add that the extra footage of ed209 shooting the executive is not in this version.  Transfer...actually not very good.  I have the special edition that has the extra footage in it, and on my upscaling dvd player (1080i) it looks nearly as good.  Beyond that the special features are minimal and the audio was merely ok.  Too bad, I wanted this to be better.     With all that said, the price for the blu-ray makes it a good buy, especially if you don't have this in your collection.  For the rest of us who like the gore and violence as it was intended...I'm sure a special edition will come out someday.
0312360266|2.0|Well I hate to say it but readers aren't stupid. No matter what age they are. I really feel Mrs. Cast should have done her homework extensively. I find the Dialogue ESPECIALLY in the first few chapters of this book aggravating. I almost put this book down MANY times. You can tell this is a 40 something writer trying to relate and sound like a teenager. Trying way to hard. Yes P.C Cast we do like big words and good writing. We're not 12 unless that was your target audience which I hope not considering the extensive sexual content in this book. It bothers me and I cannot count on two hands how many grammar and spelling mistakes there are. I had to read a few sentences multiple times in order to figure out what she was trying to say. I also can do without the (commenting in parentheses) that happen throughout the book. YOUR WRITING IN FIST PERSON we don't need those thanks.<br /><br />But I gritted my teeth and made it through the first book. In less than a week. And It did reward me in the end. There are points in the storyline that are very intriguing and interesting. I Like the story line. All the characters need work and the writing needs to be a lot better. I keep hoping maybe by the fourth or fifth book the writing will be better. I can only hope.. There are six books so my theory was that it has to get more interesting right? Well I'm on the third book now and even though the writing hasn't gotten the least bit better but the story has. So If you can deal with the awful attempt to be a \\"teen\\" book and focus on the story line. Then I suggest this read.<br /><br />Do be warned that there is a lot of sexual content in the first two books that was quite surprising. Some of it seems meaningless and just another failed attempt to gain audience. The other half of it does pertain to the story .. so that could be looked over I suppose.<br /><br />This really isn't a good book.. but I keep giving it second chances.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|(OOPS - I initially gave review this 5 stars. That was for financial potential. I'll still post this review but the rating is for the sound only.)     From Marketing Week -     This new sensation is burning up the Entertainment/Leisure markets; topping every prominent sales chart. This financial miracle was brought into being due to joint venture initiated by three firms contracted by Big Machine Records to produce a product worthy of their label.    Yu-San Corporation of Singapore, responsible for the sound production and refinement software, was initially contracted by Big Machine to modify their QXB15 SoundMastertm system for some post-production cleanup. This led to Yu-San's cross-sale initiative in conjunction with Hibro-Cyberdine Electronics to provide a miniaturized, portable version of their systems.    At this point, Yu-San and Hibro realized that their product was very marketable, but not pleasing to the eye. Foslo-Genentec, a genetics firm based in Oslo, was brought in to provide an appropriate bio-mass shell. For the past five years, Foslo has be constructing battle units for NATO, but were in financial trouble due to the failure of their \\"Lady Gaga\\" model. Their head of operations, T.C. Yutani, stated during his latest press conference, \\"We here at Foslo are very confident in our new `non-lethal' designs. Our researchers have tapped genetic archives all over the world. We have some exciting new products to offer.\\" It is rumored that Foslo found the long lost \\"Juice Newton\\" sample and used it along with bobcat, cricket and emu gene splices in this project. \\"Exciting\\" indeed!    Obviously, Big Machine is very pleased. Taylor has a very high Q rating. She scores very high in the 13 - 17 male markets. Taylor scores a 130 on Males making 30-60K, a 145 with parents with kids 0 - 17.  In fact one test subject remarked \\"duh, she's pretty-pretty\\", the extra cost for the bio-mass is paying off. Even better, her Q score for college age males is an amazing 106!!  Due to success of this and their \\"Shakira\\" model, this cooperative is making plans to go public.     Taylor Swift is a hot stock and a \\"must buy\\".  [...]
B0026P3G12|4.0|This is a beautiful and uplifting album, that sweeps you away into a world of sound and music. The songs themselves are slow paced and melodic (so if you like upbeat songs, this cd is not for you). This album is more classical, slow and sweeping. And if I were rating this album on voice quality alone I would have given it *5* stars. However I am rating the songs themselves as well, and not all of them captured me. But there are 7 out of the 12 songs that I would give a straight *5* stars to.<br /><br />My ratings are as follows:<br /><br />Wild Horses 4/5 stars<br />I Dreamed a Dream 5/5 stars<br />Cry Me a River 5/5 stars<br />How Great Thou Art 5/5 stars<br />You'll See 5/5 Stars<br />Daydream Believer 3/5 stars<br />Up to the Mountain 3/5 stars<br />Amazin Grace 5/5 stars<br />Who I was born to be 5/5 stars<br />Proud 3.5/5 stars<br />The End of the World 4/5 stars<br />silent Night 5/5 stars<br />So it rounds to a 4 star rating<br /><br />All in all this is definitely better than 90% of the albums out there. And it has become a treasured part of my keeper shelf... beautiful voice and beautiful songs!
0751529818|3.0|I loved the premise of this book. I felt great empathy for Morrie, but I also felt his too simple solutions to Man's problems were those I've heard before - many times; so even though often it pays to hear some of life's lessons again and again, I was hoping for some new insight. I didn't get it.<br /><br />I preferred \\"The Five People You Will Meet In Heaven.\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|I admit I feared my very high expectations for this CD would be dashed. Well, they weren't; in fact, they were exceeded. Track after track I was blown away by Susan's range. Every single track is a surprise, from ballads to sacred to blues.     This version of Wild Horses is more muted, more subtle, more haunting than (and I think far superior to) the belt-out version she sang on AGT. I Dreamed a Dream is exquisite, showing just how much Susan has grown since she walked onstage at BGT. Cry Me A River is more polished and more expressive than her younger version.    As for all the rest, while you may not agree with all the song or genre choices -- and the worrisome demands they occasionally make on her gorgeous voice -- one thing is indisputable: She Nails Them. Every time. This is no flash in the pan, folks. This is pure, rich, noble talent. Hats off to Susan for a great debut, and a promise of many more great things to come.    Buy this and you will not be disappointed.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I so wanted this CD to be a 5 star, but I can only rate it a 4 - 4 Plus.   I am not a music professional so will not try to critique the pieces.  There are two reasons for my mild disappointment.      The first is each piece is too polished!   They lack  the emotion and the power that Ms Boyle's  rendition of I Dreamed a Dream on Britain's Got Talent show displayed.     None of the pieces in this CD send chills down the nape of my neck as happened when I first heard her on the TV show.      The second reason is the selection of songs.   They are all too similar in theme - a life filled with sadness yet still holding hope.  I kept expecting the songs to be more joyful in theme at the end of the CD - reflecting the pattern of Ms Boyle's life and that her dreams are becoming reality.   I would have liked the Ave Maria to have been included.    Silent Night - a concession to the approaching Christmas Holiday?  - sort of out of context.   (I would love a Christmas theme CD by her.)    I am happy that I own the CD and will play it numerous times.   I just had great expectations - probably too great.
0307454541|3.0|I have to say I'm whelmed by this book.<br />Not over-, not under-, just...whelmed.<br /><br />To me, this book is like a perverted flasher in a public park.<br /><br />You're sitting around, minding your own business, reading about a framed journalist, a crumbling nepotistic business empire with a family mystery, and a strange girl with good detective skills, when all of a sudden this guy opens his jacket, assaults your senses, turns your stomach, and then closes his coat and continues on as if nothing had happened and your back to your regularly scheduled program.<br /><br />What I found most disappointing was that the title character, the said girl with the dragon tattoo, is little more than a supporting character. She is clearly the most interesting and flawed character, and there is surely a great mystery involving her past, but this book really isn't about her.<br /><br />This book should have been called \\"The Dude Who Eats Sandwiches and Coffee.\\"<br /><br />All in all, it's solidly written and the characters enjoyable, but like the family in the park, the plot left me slackjawed and semi-stupified, and not in a good way.

It's apparent that the author is somewhat full of himself, and more than a little impressed with his achievements. This can be distracting, but it's a minor problem in the context of the book.<br /><br />His conclusions are justified by data, as should be the case with any book of this type, but I especially liked how his supporting evidence was relatable and straightforward. A lot of authors support their conclusions with sentences like \\"study X shows that Y.\\" Without particular knowledge of study X, it's impossible to know whether that's really the case. Taleb uses a lot of common-sense examples to support his points. I also appreciated how he was skeptical of neuroscientists who claim to know how the brain works in specific areas.<br /><br />I won't bother to summarize the takeaways, as there are many, and it's really worth reading the book. This was definitely one of my favorite reads in recent memory.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday and was absolutely thrilled with it. Still sealed in plastic wrap and in absolute mint condition. We will enjoy many hrs. of entertainment this winter viewing this.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan's Boyle's voice is amazing - what a pleasure to listen to her on her first CD I Dreamed a Dream, but I agree she had been too coached and the musical arrangements and chorus background were overdone - Boyle's voice doesn't need that. I really wanted her to let her voice and emotions go as she did on Britain's Got Talent - the original of Cry Me a River was sexier, with more panache. I also wish the CD had more variety of pace and rhythm - too much emphasis on slow romantic ballads, although I understand her voice lends itself to those. Can't wait for the next CD, but I'd like to hear variety in the song choices - songs such as Fever (Peggy Lee); Summertime; C'est si bon (Eartha Kitt - WOW!); The Power of Love; How Am I Supposed to Live Without You; The Impossible Dream; Baby, It's Cold Outside; You Light Up My Life; At Last; Unchained Melody; The Star Spangled Banner - for starters. Susan Boyle's voice is magnificent - love the CD.
B000051Y0G|5.0|This is almost a greatest hits album in and of itself. Pretty much all the songs are great pop rock songs, a complete album of good stuff. I've generally gravitated to country/western roots rock music over the years, but I still enjoy this pure fun pop music from Cyndi from when I was a kid. (Shhh don't tell anyone!). Seriously Cyndi does a great job here and it holds up well over time.
B001FB55MG|2.0|I expected this movie to be a lot better than it was, based on the previews and the premise. With a premise like that it could have been great. It really wasted the opportunity to be a great movie. I have to put at least part of that failure on Adam Sandler's shoulders. His sarcastic and lowest common denominator attitude colored the whole movie in shades of bleah. But the writing was also lousy at times - in particular, the Bedtime Stories were pretty pathetically done. Wouldn't you think that in a movie called Bedtime Stories the stories would actually be fun, funny, or just plain good? No, the stories were like lousy SNL skits. I realize that the kids were helping make the story, but their additions were not really the problem. Anyway, the plot of the actual story was also poorly done.<br /><br />My feeling is that this could have been a GREAT movie and instead ended up as just another fairly bad Adam Sandler type of movie. That said, there are some amusing moments, Keri Russell is divine as always, and Russell Brand was fairly funny. The kids did fine, although it would be nice to just one time see a boy in a movie who doesn't have Little Kid Big Hair syndrome (pet peeve).<br /><br />This is not a horrible movie. It's a 2 star movie. Kids can watch it and be mildly amused, so can adults. But overall it was a big disappointment to me given what I thought it would and could be.
B0013FFMOK|4.0|I haven't read the novel I Am Legend.  And I haven't seen its original big screen outing, Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston.  However, I recently sat down to watch the latest Will Smith-helmed outing of I Am Legend.  The movie is thrilling, touching, and eye-popping.  It's a great evening's entertainment for fans of action and sci-fi thrillers alike.    Smith is the man who is the key to cancer.  The back story tells us that scientists obviously rocked the world when they unlocked this piece of the genetic puzzle.  What they never could have expected was the plague that would claim more lives than cancer ever did.  And that's the backdrop where we get to know Smith's Robert Neville.    Neville is the only human left in New York City.  This is the visually stunning part of the film.  The CGI really gives us an amazing view of a broken down, overgrown, post-apocalyptic New York.  Neville roars through the city hunting deer from his Ford Mustang.  Tearing up sidewalks, and dodging busses, our hero hunts wild deer with his faithful dog Sam.    At night, the two fortify themselves in Neville's apartment.  They must do this because the plague which rocked the world has turned some of its inhabitants into nocturnal monsters.  They are the key threat to our hero's world, and the one compelling reason that keeps him strong.  He was the one who unlocked Pandora's Box.  And no one else will be able to set things right.    Will Smith has come a long way since his Fresh Prince days.  Outings in films like Independence Day, Hitch, Bad Boys, and The Pursuit of Happyness have cemented Smith as a solid leading man.  I Am Legend gives him a chance to really flex his dramatic muscles.  We see Neville as eccentric hermit, grieving husband, and driven hero.    I Am Legend delivers a solid story with echoes that may leave you wondering `what if' for some time after.
B0001WE6U2|4.0|I wouldnt be writing this review if mine hadnt fallen off the camera into the Hudson river New York.     A perfect replacment for the original and have not lost it yet.
B002WXO6JO|3.0|The much bigger budget for Stargate Universe as compared to Stargate Atlantis is easily recognized in the quality of the set and the CG creativity. The main story line shows much promise and originality, the main story line being a group of civilians and military personnel stranded on a several 100,000 year old space cruiser over which they have little control as it speeds through space.    The kernel of each episode is cantered on the problems encountered while trying to keep the star cruiser running, but the script writers have taken the linear story style of Stargate Atlantis and set it on its head. About 7 out of the 9 episodes I've watched more or less use a very disruptive story telling style, IMO. Perhaps is is just my taste in film style, but I personally find the sudden and frequent changes in time between the present, the past and sometimes the future very disruptive and distressing to watch and I'm talking 15 to 20 seconds between changes from present to past, to future than back to the present. Thanks to the streaming video I am able to fast forward through these horrible ordeals.    Additionally, the script writers have written in sudden changes from reality to fantasy such as memories, flight of imagination and such things which are portrayed in a realistic style and therefore extremely hard to follow, and detracts from he main story development which is surviving on this several 100,000 year old star cruiser.    The writers seem to have decided that character development is to be done by cutting from the main activity on the star cruiser using this choppy style. It is very similar to the style used in the TV series \\"Lost\\" and equally annoying and irrelevant. It is almost as if the writers have to insert this horrible content that IMO adds nothing to the plot except extending and filling out the episodes like they couldn't think of anything else to do.    Ultimately, I find myself very often watching in suspense and interest only to be drowned in vanilla cut scenes to personal events in the characters past that does absolutely nothing for the plot or character development that could not have been done in one tenth the time in a more conventional style such as that used on the two previous Stargate series.    This TV series has the potential to be a 5 star rating. I gave it 3 and would have given it 2 1/2 if I could have because of the botched up writing of the script.    I find this rather tragic as the concept is great and the acting is more than adequate. I hope the writers stop screwing it up and get their script writing together.    I recommend this TV series only if you are willing to put up with the 7 out of every ten minutes of crap, IMO, for the three minutes out of ten that are truly great cinema.
B002MEW7YY|4.0|Before I mention the singing and music itself I actually want to mention the Zimmerman production first. Some may find it confusing, but in my opinion it actually makes more sense than a 1600s stage - Scott's original novel is a very Victorian book despite its setting. It frequently mentions the supernatural. This opera was also written in a time when Europe was fascinated by ghost stories and frightening themes. Scotland was also seen as a mysterious place to Italy on the surface - a misty and ghostly island with cloudy cold mornings in the autumn (the set seems to show late autumn when trees are bare and the land is dry). The opera itself is very appealing to its time period with such themes, so I see nothing detrimental about staging it in a Victorian era. To me, it almost makes things fall into place even more.    Some people have complained about the photographer. My main issue with him is that the scene continues to move forward, but the sextet is meant to be a moment frozen in time; the characters wouldn't be continuing the action and THEN suddenly turn to Edgardo. Other than that, the setting seemed alright. The sets and costumes were spectacular. I loved the sky, clouds, and moon in the setting. It gives a frightening atmosphere throughout. The addition of the ghost was a little cheesy for my tastes, but that's just me.     Netrebko was not the best Lucia, but most certainly not the worst I've seen/heard. Her coloratura was not the best unfortunately especially if one has heard other great performances of Lucia. Her acting was definitely convincing. Unfortunately, she fell flat in the high notes, and also sharp on others. It did not ruin it for me; I still enjoyed her performance, but it was a shame to hear some moments not as good as they could have been.     All the singers were spot-on actors. Even the minor roles were great to listen to.    Piotr Beczala's performance of a heartbroken Edgardo is amazing. His tone never faltered. Mariusz Kwiecien's Enrico was frightening in his sinister nature. It's strange, I don't know what others will think but I enjoyed Beczala and Kwiecien throughout but in their duet in act three it seemed their voices didn't blend too well. Perhaps that's just me. Netrebko and Beczala's voices though sounded great together.    In act one, one of the horns was sharp in the garden scene, but it didn't ruin anything. Except for that moment the orchestra was great, and I think Armiliato did a fine job conducting it.    I mean no offense to any fans; I do not think this should have been the performance put on DVD considering their other performances, but this is by no means a bad recording to own. I would recommend it. It's still enjoyable; I ended up watching it twice the day I got it.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|The great thing about this album is that, when you are interested in listening to something that complements the season but you are emotionally exhausted by Christmas music, you can put this album on and it will totally rejuvenate your spirit. It is such a great complement to the season of winter, as it restores the balance by tugging in a direction opposite to that of Christmas music.    As others have said here, it is a \\"winter\\" album, and there are not enough of these around.    I don't want to review the individual songs because, in this case, they are part of a total work and you just have to take the whole thing in.    \\"The Hounds of Winter\\" is not the same one as previously recorded. It is the same song, but not the same version. It has been re-done to fit the character of this album.    You will know whether the above description appeals to you. If it does, the album is very much recommended.
B0026ICMOG|5.0|Disney at its best this is a super Gift Set, great value for money its such a shame that we cannot get a Region 2 Set like this. In the UK we do not seem to get anything as good as this , never mind its still a good purchase from Amazon .com.  I would recommend this very highly 5 stars all the way. The Seven Dwarfs are worth the money on there own, buy it today whilst you can ...
B002UXRH10|5.0|this album is a must buy its all new and shes in a darker place as where i am lol!!! a must have!!!
B002O1TMI4|5.0|I love this album.  I normally gravitate towards heavier music but this is an amazing album.  I can hear so many different bands when listening to The Resistance.  I hear Queen, U2, Led Zepplin, and believe it or not System of a Down.  The slower Exogenesis tracks are not something I really like but five stars for the rest of the tracks.  I also like the meaning behind the lyrics in many of the songs.  Almost an intellectual feel to them.  Don't hesitate and download now!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Don't buy this CD because of the novelty of how Susan got this far. Buy this CD because it is magnificent!
B0026P3G12|5.0|One Word:  Brilliant.    And after you've listened, hours later, you'll hear her voice in your dreams, your heart...her voice becomes your own.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|That to me is the theme of this movie.  It's an outstanding offering by Pixar that covers a wide array of emotions, has several good messages, and is just plain fun to watch.  It'll make you teary eyed at times and in other parts have you laughing out loud.        When I first saw the promos for this I thought it be ridiculous with the floating house bit so I was hesitant to buy it.  But after all good reviews from friends and zero bad ones I got it for myself.  The floating house not only works, it's perfect for the story line!      Don't want to give any of it away, just going to say that if you have any heart at all, you simply have to watch this movie.  It's great for children and adults.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|The public has been force-fed musical swill for so long in the form of lousy poetry and lousier choreography masquerading as music, cheap-shot bad-taste lyrics, and overall digital monotony that it's forgotten what the evolution of a great singer/songwriter/musician even looks like. Professional musicians, producers, engineers, and other music industry pros all know better, and have applauded the advent of John Mayer.    I've completely enjoyed watching Mayer go from an unsure super-talented 22-year-old kid, to a veteran singer/songwiter and touring musician who's lyrical wisdom belies his age. BATTLE STUDIES is the next exciting step in the evolution of a superstar whose impact on the pop/blues/rock music scene is undeniable.    The songs are so well-writen it takes a number of listenings to get the full measure of John Mayer's genius. Do yourself a favor and buy ALL of John's CDs, if you don't already have them, and view for yourself the uncommon success that every musician/singer/songwriter dreams about achieving. John Mayer has only just begun and will be around for a long time to come. BATTLE STUDIES is highly recommended.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activitiy is one of those movies that is scary when you're watching it, but later that night when your lying in bed thinking about it, it's TERRIFYING! For a low budget the special effects were really really great, eerily so. I definitly recommend this movie for those who are looking for a fun horror movie.
0446402397|5.0|\\"Trust but check... Check on those we trust.\\"    Very clever murder mystery tale with historical underpinnings.  I couldn't help but think of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" as I was reading this, yet it is much more advanced and nuanced.  The tension of the police state grip this entire story as husbands can't trust wives, parents can't trust daughters, and around every corner lies a citizen on the look out for an Enemy of the State.  With the setting of the Soviet security apparatus and all the deception, fear, tension, and intrigue that entails, the gripping tale and compelling characters make this novel a fantastic read that is difficult to put down.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This was even better than I had hoped!  Thank you Susan for liner notes with your thoughts and the lyrics.  My top favorites were UP TO THE MOUNTAIN (she really wails on that one) and PROUD (made me weep!!!).  Great selections.  Want to listen over and over, tell others.  Please please make another very soon!!!
B0026P3G12|2.0|I agree that Susan Boyle has a beautiful, Nature-given voice.  But, Susan would never have gotten to the finals of American Idol if she sang songs like the ones on this album.  The judges would have cried \\"old-fashioned\\" and \\"boring!\\"  Plus, the arrangements here are of the type you find on \\"New Age\\" relaxation (eg., yoga) CD's.  One could use this CD to counteract insomnia!    And, if I knew she was going to include such great religious \\"hits\\" as \\"Amazing Grace,\\" \\"How Great Thou Art,\\" and \\"Silent Night,\\" I never would have pre-ordered this CD.  I could have gone to church, instead!    P.S.  Adam Lambert's CD is MUCH better, even if the lyrics are a bit offensive at times.
0061537969|5.0|I'm not a dog lover, but I love the dog in this book. I'm not at all interested in car racing, but I love what I learn about it thanks to the dog. It's such a beautiful story--beautifully written, beautifully laid out, meaningful and inspirational--everything. It took me a while to get into it at first, and several weeks went by between I started it and took it up again, but once I did, I was unable to put it down, even to prepare for Thanksgiving dinner. The ending is probably too sappy and unrealistic, but I love it anyway.
1601251831|5.0|The art is quite good.<br />Layout is correct, clear and easy to check.<br />Monsters and races: All the \\"classics\\" plus an interesting extra bunch of them. Some \\"Lovecraftian\\" monsters too, like shoggoth.<br />Rules/\\"crunchies\\": Clear, simplified, not overhelming<br />As a final note, aimed to the last reviewer: there is a FULL alfabetical INDEX to find the monster you want; and THREE apendixes that sort all the monsters by different criteria: Type, Challenge Rating and Terrain. Sub-types (Like dragons) are they all grouped in same section so there is very difficult to fail finding one of them.
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I first heard Susan Boyle on the U-Tube posting, I was simply blown away by her beautiful voice and masterful interpretation of her song.  I have been anxiously waiting for this album ever since and it has not disappointed.  The song selections are marvelous and her voice and interpretation for each song is just amazing.  Every time I hear her sing \\"Wild Horses\\" the hairs on the back of my neck just rise.  She is a treasure and hers is an amazing story of triumph and of fulfilling a dream.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|I was a bit worried about the stereo version, after all what has been written about the limitation of the two tracks recordings. Actually it's very good and makes for a new listening experience if you are used to the mono version.  The album itself is of course a classic. I saw her standing there and Twist and shout are Rock'n Roll at is best !  Worth it for sure !
B000002VCB|2.0|If you're a man on the rebound after a disastrous love affair, this album might be for you.  For anyone else though -- not so much.  Because I'm an APP fan I have the album, but I can't really recommend it.*<br /><br />The misogyny in this album is unsubtle and juvenile, starting with the album cover itself.  \\"Lie Down With Dogs\\" is probably the nadir of Alan Parson's career.  It's the \\"Sicilian Defense\\" that made it out of MCI's vault.<br /><br />The album is only partially redeemed by \\"Winding Me Up\\" and \\"You Won't Be There.\\"  It's too bad everything else has to drag those songs down.<br /><br />*  I could even recommend \\"Keats\\" and \\"Freudiana\\" and the soundtrack from \\"LadyHawke\\" before this dreck.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|I was a bit worried about the stereo version, after all what has been written about the limitation of the two tracks recordings.

B000002VCU|5.0|After \\"I Robot\\" APP had some difficulties replicating their commercial and artistic success.  They hit the big time again with this album, a wonderful example of how concept, artistic creativity and pop appeal can be flawlessly combined.  The pop hits, particularly \\"Time,\\" draw the listener in, but the subtler and in some ways better songs like \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" and \\"Turn of a Friendly Card Pt. 2\\" can be listened to over and over and are still just as enjoyable now as when the album was released.  A definite must-have for any music fan.
B000025THW|4.0|Even if you are not a big fan of pop music, or 1980s music, Prefap Sprout is a band you cannot help but love.<br /><br />Jorden: The Comeback is prime example of why this band is simply irresistable, no matter your musical stripe. The album is coated by the synth sheen that dates it to the very early 1990s--really, this is 1980s music<br /><br />But I would not be suprised if everyone in Prefab Sprout was bald, because they sure are no hair band. There are Bacharach like pieces here, soul, samba, jazz, and sleek pop.<br /><br />Paddy McCloon's knowlage of music is comprehensive, and his command of every style so firm, he can take any style and create a mini-masterpiece, almost at will. With producer Thomas Dolby, he ran a modern sound through all these styles, and this threads the music together, perfectly.<br /><br />In the 1980s and that first sliver of the 1990s, before Nirvana cracked, a lot of this type of production was used to sheen boring, subtanceless music. With Prefab, the opposite is true--the perfect surfaces on Jorden lend even more elegance and shine to what is already some of the classiest and most sophistacted music out there.<br />This band takes the time to use synths percisly, finding the perfect texture to back each tear inducing note they sing.<br /><br />When you pair this musical command with McCloons incredible cultural litteracy--how many \\"pop\\" smiths can write songs about Jessie James and Bobby Fishcer and make it perfectly come off--you realize there is simply no way to go wrong with the Prefab Sprout.
B00005ATQF|4.0|While `Full Metal Jacket' is a Vietnam War film, don't go in looking for another `Platoon'. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the key to understanding `Full Metal Jacket' is to realise that this is a Kubrick film first and a war film second. Both boot camp and battlefield merely serve as a backdrop for the usual Kubrick themes and ideas, and the final product bears more similarity to `Clockwork Orange' than to other war movies.     Being a Stanley Kubrick film, it goes without saying that the technical aspects of `Full Metal Jacket' are almost flawless. Kubrick makes excellent use of pans, long shots, close-ups, and point-of-view, and some of the battle scenes in the second half are given realism by the use of hand-held camerawork. Kubrick also does a good job in set design; using a British army base to substitute for US Marine boot camp was a no-brainer, but amazingly a dilapidated London gasworks was very realistically transformed into the Vietnamese city of Hue.     As has been often noted, the film is split into two parts, and in some ways is almost two independent films. The first half, dealing with Marine boot camp, is exceptional. R Lee Emery's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is terrifyingly realistic, and has to be seen to be believed. His interactions with his \\"maggots\\", especially his relentless abuse of Private Pyle, are at once hilarious and disturbing. And Vincent Donofrio as the misfit-turned-psychopath Pyle is also outstanding.     However, the brilliance of the first half means the second part of the film can fall a bit flat. One big problem is that Hartman and Pyle are the two most interesting characters in the movie, but are absent from the second half, meaning Joker has to carry this part of the film. But Joker is a fairly weak protagonist; he seems designed as an \\"everyman\\" that we can identify with, but his very ordinariness means he is often overshadowed by more interesting characters such as Hartman, Pyle, and (in the second half) Animal Mother. He's really just a pair of eyes through which we see the war and its effects on men.    One way in which `Full Metal Jacket' differs from other war films is that it doesn't have an explicit message. In typical Kubrick fashion, he refuses to settle for easy answers; he presents the characters and events as they are, and forces us to draw our own conclusions. On one hand, the absence of any \\"pass the bucket\\" flag-waving or preachy anti-war posturing is a welcome relief. But on the other, the rather detached and academic approach of the film can make it difficult to engage with. While there are some powerful scenes, `Full Metal Jacket' lacks the nightmarish feel of `Apocalypse Now', or the strong emotional pull of something like `The Deer Hunter'.     In all, `Full Metal Jacket' is a typical Kubrick film, so if you've seen any of his other movies, you'll probably already know whether you'll love it or hate it. Those expecting a gung-ho action fest or a film with a clear \\"point\\" might be disappointed, but open-minded war movie fans should find this a unique and challenging take on Vietnam.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|I'll keep this short, Sons of Anarchy is a terrifically entertaining show.   That fact that I'm saying this surprises me a whole lot to be honest.  When I first heard of SoA and its premise, I couldn't help but find it a bit laughable.   Now however, that sounds way too cynical, because I've been proven wrong. And I'm very glad I have!  Whether it is a club-internal dissension, keeping the authorities off their backs or competing with rival motorcycle clubs,   SoA has always something interesting in store.    Sons of Anarchy is certainly worth to have a look at, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
0307716988|5.0|It was nice to learn about MJ with his own words instead of  the stuff you hear by the media.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I truly enjoy listening to this cd.  It takes me somewhere...Rihanna shares with us that inner person that is conflicted, edgy, and down right passionate.  She lets you in to feel her hurt, her pain...her story.  Favorites:  \\"Hard,\\" Russian Roulette,\\" \\"Te Amo,\\" \\"Wait Your Turn,\\" \\"Stupid in Love,\\" and \\"Photographs.\\"  I look forward to more good music from this artist.  Add this cd to your library.  It will take you to a place a little off the mainstream path.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written on amazon and it might be the last. I have listened to many albums and I have been captivated by some very special albums that seem to capture my very soul. This album ladies and gentleman is one of them. I borrowed this album from a close friend who said one thing to me before he handed me the album...\\" Listen to the entire album 3 times\\". Fate has it that it sat on my cd stand for 3 years. Last month I decided to give it a spin and needless to say I have been hooked. I have no words for how great, how awesome this album truly is. It would be a crime against your ears, a crime against man, a crime against your soul not to hear this.    Please I beg you, hear me and listen to me very closely. This is the the best album I have ever heard since OK Computer. Better that Stankonia. Better that Kid A. Better that Stop Making Sense. I kid you not. I was completely sucked in by the emotion that was infused into every melody, its almost heartbeaking. The peaks and valley are truly awe inspiring and leave you breathless at every turn. I don't know when the I was going to find my Beetles, my Weezer, My Nivana.... but I have arrived and the destinations name is my \\"Funeral\\"    I have heard their live show is even better than the album and if that is the case then be prepared to crown the new \\"greatest band in the world\\". I will be at the throne, bowing gracefully to the new kinds of rock. Not even Jesus can stop the Arcade Fire now.    Antony
B000EGFVQS|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this novel has a very specific audience.  It's not for everyone.  If you are the type of person who is into reading thrillers or murder mysteries, it's not for you.  This book centers around the idea of what happens after one has passed away, not just in the perspective of a family dealing with the tragedy but the person herself.  It opens up the idea about what happens after we pass away, and what happens to those \\"unfinished items\\" that we left behind.  It has a very loving, funny yet sad tone.   Don't get me wrong it's not sad and depressing.  In fact the author is very witty and her writing ability makes the story that much more interesting.  This book gives the hope that for anyone dealing with the loss of a loved one, that the individual who passed away is at peace in the afterlife, and that the people who experienced the loss eventually do learn to be at peace with the tragedy, and carry on with a happy memory in their heart.
B000002I4S|5.0|Overview:<br /><br />Along with Kind of Blue this album is pretty much is as good as it gets... the pinacle of jazz. Coltrane is at his best here.  While there are many albums that you could argue are Coltrane's best, this album has my vote.  From start to finish every track is an A+.  While normally I don't like an album that has shifting personal, this album is the exception.  This album consists of John Coltrane and legendary bassist Paul Chambers, with Art Taylor (drums) and Tommy Flanagan (piano) on half the tracks and Wynton Kelly (piano) and Jimmy Cobb (drums) on the other half.  This album is pretty much the end of the classic hard bop period for Coltrane.  After this album Coltrane slowly transitioned from hard bop into the avante garde.  This album also marked the  of Coltrane's exclusive tenor sax playing as Coltrane would soon double on soprano sax and tenor sax on future albums.<br /><br />Song Highlights:<br /><br />Giant Steps:<br />This song features one of the best tenor sax solos of all times.  Once of my friends put it best... Coltrane is dancing with is notes here...<br /><br />Cousin Mary:<br />This song has a classic melody and is a real burner.  Any jazz fan can't help but get excited by this tune.<br /><br />Naima:<br />This tune is your classic ballad.  Chambers bass line (as always) really makes this a special tune.  It may take a few listens but eventually you'll have this as a regular on your itunes shuffle.<br /><br />Mr. PC:<br />One of the best burners of all time.  A great song, with great solos that is fun to play and to listen to.<br /><br />This album is #2 on my all time list of albums.  No one will disagree that you can't go wrong with Giant Steps.
0385504225|2.0|Let me first off start by saying that I am definitely a fan of Dan Brown.  I enjoy the integration of factual items, places, events, etc into a fictional novel.  It really leaves you wondering if there is another side to what you have been told or have come to know.  That being said, this novel fell short of the expectations I had for Dan Brown.  Although it was pretty much impossible to create another masterpiece like the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons ran along the same lines and was entertaining. But it seemed like for the Lost Symbol Dan Brown had only half of the facts and hoped that he could cover up his dead end research though a \\"gripping\\" story. Sorry to say, it didn't work.  Here's my beef with this novel:    1) It is the same cookie cutter formula as his other two books of the Robert Langdon series. I understand that each author has his/her own formula, however this was extremely repetitive.  Let's get a slightly different plot.     2) The book was VERY predictable.  I knew what was coming a mile away even though this book attempted to give you twists and turns and leave you hanging on.  And mind you these \\"attempts\\" were often just incomplete chapters that lead you into the next 10 chapters so you can basically read what you knew was going to happen.     3) There was really no development of Noetic science.  I personally love the concept of it, but it really didn't have anything to do with the plot.  It's almost as if Dan Brown was trying to incorporate two deep ideologies that just don't quite fit.  Stick with the Noetic Science and develop that.      4) There was such a build up in the novel for some spectacular \\"thing\\" that was going to be revealed.  And at the end of the book you realize that you've been duped.      5) There needed to be more character development.  There were so many characters being thrown in and out.  And even now I am still questioning what happened to some of the characters in the book and what the point of their introductionwas.     6) There were a lot of open-ended items that Dan Brown did not go back and explain them.  The Kryptos Statue.....have no idea what the hidden message is and I'm not sure if that was the point.  The Bible buried in the obilesk...what are the hidden messages? Don't leave me hanging.      Like I said, I do appreciate Dan Brown's books. However I think there needed to be a bit more nurturing of this novel so that it could have reached its true potential.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|This album was a disappointment. The bass and drums dominated and my ears hurt trying to listen to her voice over the noise. It would have been just as effective if she had phoned in her track as it was a lackluster performance. This was another mistake in trying to change her style as with the Peter Malick group featuring Norah. When I purchase a performer's album, I expect to hear that particular person's talent, not the support talent. The piano was her forte and suits her voice style much better. If I had wanted rock with overwhelming thumping \\"with a good beat and you can dance to it\\" this might have been a good choice but her voice was lost on this latest effort. What happened to the clever songs and great arrangements of previous works? If her next album is handled by the same person I won't waste my time or money on it.
B000092T6M|1.0|I was really looking forward to getting a DVD from this seller, it was one that I couldn't find in regular stores like Borders or Target (and believe me, I tried).  I ordered the movie and they said it would take 12 to 17 business days, so I knew I'd have to wait, but when a month had gone by and I still hadn't received the DVD in the mail, I sent a really polite email to the seller to have them let me know the status.  They never responded to my email, and I still have not received the DVD in the mail.  If you're planning on buying anything through SummerTime26, you might want to look elsewhere (unless you like paying for nothing)
1594152497|1.0|After hearing from an acquaintance that this book helped her find her purpose in life, I decided to read the first few pages online to see what it was about.<br /><br />Be prepared to read a lot of nothing saturated with adjectives, adverbs, and passive sentences used to cover up the fact that this is a bunch of... well.. nothing (probably, most likely, is said to, etc).<br /><br />\\"The first flower probably did not survive for long (...)\\"<br /><br />\\"Those delicate and fragrant beings we call flowers come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species (...)\\" Trust me, if the first thing human beings noticed had been flowers, our ancestors would have been killed by predators before we existed.<br /><br />\\"Flowers were most likely the first thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Buddha is said to have given a 'silent sermon'\\"<br /><br />\\"Any life-form in any realm - mineral, vegetable, animal, or human, can be said to undergo 'enlightenment.'\\" Excuse me?! Since when are minerals alive???<br /><br />Get a good poetry book instead if you want to read flowery language (pun intended) to distract you from your problems. I'm glad I haven't spent my money on this piece of junk!
0553381687|4.0|I was intrigued to read \\"Game of Thrones\\" because I learned that HBO is filming this book for a new series. I believe it will be the only fantasy series they have produced apart from Carnivale. A hundred pages in, I saw why they chose it. The characters are brilliant (including many strong female characters), and the imagined island empire of Westeros is astoundingly believable, complete and textured.<br /><br />First of all, I can't believe Martin had the balls to start this book. It is the first of a projected 6-book series (now perhaps 7). Each is 700 pages. So far, 4 books of the series are out. Needless to say, don't start this book unless you are prepared for a hardcore epic fantasy that spans at least 4200 pages.<br /><br />Westeros is a feudal society inhabiting a world in which the seasons last for years. The series begins as a decade of summer is ending, in the Northern stronghold Winterfell, home of the noble family Stark. They were the Northern Kings of old, but they swore fealty to the conquering Dragon kings long ago, as did the other 7 original kingdoms of Westeros. The current Lord, Eddard (Ned) Stark, is a unbendingly honorable man who helped to unseat the last, dangerously mad dragon King, and place his friend Robert Baratheon on the throne. Ned's lady wife Catelyn Tully is a daughter of a powerful southern lord. The series is anchored by their six children:<br /><br />Jon Snow, 16, is a bastard Ned fathered with an unknown woman. He was raised as a brother to the other \\"trueborn\\" children, but destined to never really belong.<br /><br />Robb, 14, is the heir and absolutely like his father Lord Snow in both intractable honor and battlefield brilliance, born and bred to lead. He and Jon are close.<br /><br />Sansa, 12, is a red-haired knockout and perfect lady whose sweetness and innocence wins unlikely protectors to her side.<br /><br />Arya, 9, is a spitfire, untamable girl who longs to be like her older brothers. Jon gives her a dagger of Valerian steel, and she learns to swordfight in secret. Perhaps the strongest character in the series.<br /><br />Bron, 6, seems destined to follow Robb in physical prowess and intelligence--but tragedy strikes, and he must take a different path.<br /><br />Rickon, a 3-year-old hellion child always running after his older brothers, he is most like Arya in personality. You get a sense even at a very early age that this kid is going to be a berserker when he grows up.<br /><br />The series begins with the Stark children finding a litter of six direwolf pups--two girls, four boys, one for each child--which seem destined to be their protectors. The direwolf is the symbol of house Stark: a wolf the size of a pony from the far north. The bond that these animals have with the Stark children plays an important role in the story.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, the arc of the series is as follows: King Robert dies, and then there is a struggle for succession between the Starks and several other noble families. There are oceans of blood shed and battles fought, mayhem, violence, treachery and villainy, hairbreadth escapes, plotting, and a bit of sorcery as well. The bad guys are brutal, and the good guys are hard as nails. But while the noble families play their \\"game of thrones,\\" behind the great Wall to the north the undead Others wait for winter to come...<br /><br />Despite its length, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is fairly fast-paced, and the characters drag you into their world. After I finished it I immediately had to read the rest of the series. Unfortunately I have to say book 4, A Feast of Crows, was disappointing. After killing off a passle of important characters, Martin felt the need to create a whole new set of characters and introduce a few new plotlines. I really feel that detracted from the main thrust of the story and I ended up skipping most of their chapters. Plus, his tendency to slow down the narrative by describing every damned sigil, pedigree and morsel of food has gotten out of control! Does this man not have an editor?<br /><br />At the end of AFOC, Martin confessed that he wrote too much for one book, so most of the good characters will be coming back in volume 5, \\"A Dance of Dragons.\\" Great, thanks. I would recommend reading the first three books, then waiting until ADOD comes out. That way if you find yourself as disappointed with AFOC as I did, you can skim it and go straight to the next book.od has gotten out of control!

B002R68U7K|5.0|FIRST of all, this is a best buy. If you complained about the price than you did NOT shop around. If you really wanted it you would have shopped around for the best price. Now regarding to the collection, the first word to come to mind is Breathtaking!! The compilation is WAY better than expected. Flipping through each of the singles, I completely forgot just how many singles were released. I became nostalgic. This is defintely a MUST get for all of B's fans. The pictures for each of the singles looked amazing and each were neatly packaged together. The box is kind of heavy (that's how many singles are included). Also included is a booklet with tidbits for each single, such as record sale numbers and trivia-like information. Finally, the DVD of all her music videos is visually stunning. BEST BUY!!!
B002BSHXJA|1.0|I consider myself one of the biggest Beatle fans out there.....I have purchased  every Beatles recording in every format ever produced.  In other words....I am wondering how many more times I will buy the White Album in my lifetime.  I purchased the Stereo Box set a few months ago and thought it sounded great and then I read magazine reviews of the Mono set and decided that I had to have it as well.  The packaging is great on the Mono set......but that is where it ended for me.  The Stereo set really sounds better than the Mono set and anyone who says different is basing it on the fact that some \\"expert\\" told them the mono set is better in a magazine.  I wanted the mono set to be better as well and I based my decision to plop down another $240.00 on those reviews.  The guys behind the Beatle machine are good at getting money from fans and they have perfected it over the past 40 years.   I'm sure that if they hadn't produced both mono & stereo versions...Beatle fans would have cried for them (including me) until they were produced.  I applaud the Beatle machine for keeping the magic alive after all of these years.....  The mono set is not bad...it's sound is a little empty as compared to the stereo remasters.   Since I have both sets....I will probably give the mono set to my brother for Chrismas since he cant afford to buy the Beatle catalog over and over again.      I am giving the Mono Set 1 star because the Stereo Set simply sounds better than the Mono Set and the fact that it is $240.00. It is over hyped...   I'm also doing it because I dont want someone to plop down all that money without hearing it and comparing them side by side first.  Everyone has different tastes so do yourself a favor and try to compare them Side by Side before buying one or the other.    I'm sure that I will also buy the 5.1 surround or TXH versions if they ever come out with them as well...    Save your hard earned money if you have to choose between one set or the other and buy the Stereo Remaster set.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Though I will not be caught in the Twilight hype:  Read all/any of the books  See all/any of the movies  Or get into the Edward/Jacob arguments    I am highly impressed with this soundtrack and acquired artists    I would like to initially thank Youtube for introducing me to one of these songs  Hearing Damage (from Thom Yorke)  I thought was an unreleased song for Thom Yorkes solo works  The info box then mentioned Twilight New Moon    Maybe its because some flippin awesome bands and people that were used (Thom Yorke, BRMC, Muse...)  Maybe its the surprisingly well thought meshing of energetic instruments, but sub-dark lyrics    Whether this CD be called  - a soundtrack  - a benefit-cause collabaration worthy album [like Product(RED)]  - or a ridiculously planned b-side collection    This CD is well worth buying -> its on my to buy list
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Lady GaGa is just fantastic.  She is the best thing around to hit the music world right now. She has the best voice, the best lyrics, the best style and the best sounds.  I don't know why \\"The Fame Monster\\" is an extention off of \\"The Fame\\" and not just a completely different album.  It's cool they released it seperately though. The best songs for me are \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"I'm So Happy I Could Die\\" (the best Lady GaGa song ever).  I even like \\"Speechless\\" which reminds me of a Queen or Elton John influenced song. Every song on here is great, it's quality not quanity, right?  I'm so impressed with Lady GaGa and I can't wait for another album.  She's exciting and fresh and she gives the music industry a life injection which it desperately needs.  All hail Lady GaGa!  U go Miss Lady!
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Coincidentally, Norah Jones and John Mayer both host debuts in the same week  Both John Mayer and Norah Jones have gone off different path in their typical music  But Norah Jones wins out with her movement    With the debut work \\"Come Away With Me\\" and follow up \\"Feels Like Home\\" display jazz with country-genes masterpieces. It was heavy on the grand piano, her sultry/airy vocals and the suttle band backdrop that creates amazing music. Its albums that jerks the heart and can make grown men cry.    Her recent work on \\"Not Too Late\\" was all suttle changes from her norm. It was no longer all lovey-dubby songs (some songs politcally driven). It was not all grand piano (Yes, she plays guitar as well). She is writing/co-writing her lyrics. A little-big factor, it had a sense of being relaxed (little bit of fun to it). It was a great piece of work and still listenable. Norah seemed to no longer take it so serious; a movement is coming.    Her newest work, \\"The Fall\\", Norah Jones really broke out of her shell. The Grand piano and traditional back drop was nearly all lost - for a rock influenced conglomerate off keyboards and stomp effects. She has basically taken over for song writing. It still has her vocals piping away softly, but the sound is relaxed completely. This is a FUN album. The first song alone is precursor to what is to be an experience unlike any other. Does not matter if end up repeating the album or specific songs - its all grand with Norah Jones and her new album \\"the Fall\\".
0452295548|5.0|The power behind this book is a massive stroke. Without that there is no book, even though this woman is a brain scientist. This massive stroke taught this woman how the brain works from first hand experience. She is not teaching what she learned to get her doctorate in brain science. It is great to read to learn about how the brain works, what the purpose of life is and dealing with severe adversity. The child know what the purpose of life is but the person forgets and gets confused.    It is strange that after this woman has this stroke that she becomes Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2008. If people are not thrilled with how she describes things, keep in mind that she is trying to describe something that is indescribable. Whenever that happens many people can complain with how it is expressed but the person is doing the best they can to talk about something that is beyond words. The following book (Stumbling on Happiness) describes the many imperfections of how the mind and memory works from many studies that were done. You cannot criticize a person for flaws in the human mind. A major reason for these flaws is that the human brain has limited memory like a computer. So it needs to do different things or tricks to conserve memory that can make it inaccurate.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|Previous works had Mayer play his music based on feeling, groove - jam moments...  Of course an indirect is the music was more focused on him (Acoustic or not)  This go around, it seemd to place a programmed/synthd album with more help from the band    I am in full support of Mayer tinkering with ideas and changing sounds  But this album really did not get my hearts attention full-heartly  It felt very much like a marketed pop-cd  Some songs are worthwhile/catchy, when rest of the CD time is filler  It felt like soo much effort applied, it lost the organic/natural sound    Part of the problem as well is he created such a standard  Kind of like when Radiohead/Thom Yorke pursuing the perfect album  John Mayer had his standards grow with every successor album  All in order to avoid going back to the \\"same old thing\\"    I actually like the \\"same old thing\\"  He has a brilliant mind and a great crew behind him  I'm sure he a massive archive of music at studios that fits the \\"Same Old Thing\\" but still original works (and still work)  I've heard some songs never released to LPs like \\"Victoria\\" and \\"Sucker\\"(original and an Improv version)  He still has it, will have it, but he's confining it (Sad Story)    We'll have to wait on his next album on if he regresses back to his roots in music  Or will he continue tinkering towards his next sound
0762434279|1.0|He's a fraud.  Yes I bought the book and curious I did a lot of searching on the Internet.  Turns out the \\"Rich Dad\\" in Hawaii doesn't exit.  Also Kiyosaki's real father, the \\"Poor Dad\\" from his book was very well off.  He comes from money and has a \\"gift\\" for selling his Jibber Jabber to the masses.  Just a year or so ago there was a big rift between he and his wife and their partner and the partner told all.  He lives in Phoenix (Paradise Valley if I remember correctly), not far from where I live.    Honestly, he makes his money from selling gimmicks.  Ask yourself, if YOU had the great \\"secret\\" to financial wealth, why would you bother traveling the country doing the seminar circuit hawking books and board games extolling the principles of wealth generation?  If you felt so grateful for that gift of knowledge wouldn't you just want to give it away?  Post it all on a website for the world to read?    Before wasting your money on another get-rich gimmick, think before you click.

0618918248|5.0|What a beautiful book.  Dawkins explores, in ways that are both playful and scientific, the dark side of blind belief and the way blind belief translates into a kind of mental and political prison.  People don't typically choose religion; rather, it is imposed on them the way blinders are imposed on a horse.  We (The human race, via science) have come a long way in our thinking and there's no longer a justifiable need to hang on to oppressive beliefs that keep us blind to the very nature of reality.  Darwin's theory of Evolution and particularly \\"adaptation,\\" (as well as all the DNA experiments and ll of the fossil records) confirms conclusively that evolution is a fact the way the law of gravity is a fact.  There is no need to willingly lobotomize yourself or your children.  And what religious fundamentalists sadly miss by clinging to ideology over scientific facts, is the liberating power and beauty of Darwin's thought.  He truly explains how species evolved and where they came from and it is such a sublime and beautiful story!  Why not embrace and celebrate what is so obviously true?  Dawkins does a great job of bringing the joy of that discovery to life!  (Let go of your chains; they can only bring you down!)

And Susan looks lovely in all her photos included on the CD as well.  I wanted to cry out of joy for her, and and for her talent. This woman is a gift to the world and I'm so glad she finally has the recognition she deserves. \\"I dreamed a dream\\",  well her dream came true and so did her mother's dream for her. BRAVO.
031604461X|5.0|After reading some of the solidly negative reviews in regard to Breaking Dawn, I was very concerned that I was not going to like it. All I can say is that after reading it, I wouldn't change a thing. No one is ever going to say that the writing in any of the Twilight books literary genius, and it isn't meant to be. It's simply a story, which I finding vivid and engaging from book one through four. I have spent considerable time thinking about Breaking Dawn and what, if anything, I would change. Honestly, I think what Stephanie Meyer wrote is EXACTLY in keeping with the series. It just wouldn't be within keeping of the rest of the set to create any seriously tragic endings and/or to not have the story wrap exactly as it did. She did a great job satifying both the reader and the story- entertaining and keeping you wanting to read more all the way to the last page- honestly, what more is needed?

But after reading this book it's hard to resist going back to page 1 and starting all over again.  I read it last year and just reread it.  I think I may read it once a year!  The story was so real for me it's hard to believe these characters don't exist.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book.  Liesel Meminger, Rudy Steiner, Hans and Max will stay in your heart for a long time.

0312370849|5.0|When the Nazis unexpectedly came one night to get Sarah and her family, no one in the family thought that they would be gone long. Least of all Sarah. In order to protect her brother, she locked him in a hiding place within their apartment in Paris, taking the key, and promising to return. Devastatingly, the family's excursion was not a short one. They were taken to Auschwitz.<br /><br />Sixty years later, Julia, an American reporter living in Paris with her husband and daughter, learns about the little discussed roundup in Paris during World War II. Appalled that the Vel D'hive incident is not known among her French countrymen, she searches for answers, finding a link between her in-laws and the story of Sarah.<br /><br />Ms. Rosnay weaves together the story of Sarah and the story of Julia, alternating between the two linked stories. Tragedy, love, devotion, and pain flit between these two stories, revealing painful truths and realities. Beautifully and sensitively crafted, this story is not one that the reader will easily forget.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Twenty and more years since a young and illiterate woman was an SS guard,<br />she is put on trial. Christianity is the basis of most western morality<br />that has become law, but forgiving people hasn't made it past the 2000<br />years of civilization since Jesus? Did this woman take advantage of the 15 year old boy<br />or did he take advantage of her? When he held the key to her<br />being delivered from an unjust prison sentence, he withheld the knowledge he had<br />because it would have brought out his shame?<br />Who were the victims, those who died a relatively quick death<br />in the camps or the people who had to live long lives knowing what they had done?<br />This film makes more questions than can be answered.<br />One mad monster of a man drove a nation to inhumanity<br />with his speeches and millions of Jews died as a result.<br />I think maybe that taking revenge on guards in the camps<br />is not a Christian act, even if entirely legal.

B00003CXD0|5.0|TOOTSIE is now well and truly over 25 years old, but still remains as fresh and funny as it was when it first premiered.  A real joy.  Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray and Teri Garr star in this keenly observed Sydney Pollack gem with a genuine New York showbusiness background.<br /><br />Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is New York's most untouchable, unemployable actor.  No one in the business is prepared to work with him, and he's reduced to operating as an acting coach for others who can't seem to land a break in the industry, including painfully awkward Sandy (Teri Garr).  Finally, in a last-ditch bid to find a role - any role - Michael frocks up as \\"Dorothy Michaels\\" and lands a job on top-rating TV soap \\"Southwest General\\".<br /><br />Playing the no-nonsense chief of staff Emily Kimberley, \\"Dorothy\\" wins thousands of female fans all over the country.  But when Michael starts falling in love with co-star Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) - who has well and truly taken the endearing \\"Dorothy\\" to heart as her best friend - how on earth will Michael reveal himself without destroying his/her trust relationship with Julie in the process?...<br /><br />TOOTSIE is one of those rare films I could sit through several times a week and never get bored with.  This is mainly due to the incredible performances but props must also be given to the outstanding screenplay from Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal.  Dustin Hoffman is so good at playing altar-ego \\"Dorothy\\" that I STILL sometimes forget that it's not an actual woman!<br /><br />Composer Dave Grusin and songwriters Alan & Marilyn Bergman supplied the Oscar-nominated soundtrack (\\"Tootsie\\", \\"It Might Be You\\"); Sydney Pollack has a cameo role as Michael's agent.  Also keep your eyes peeled for small appearances from Christine Ebersole, Estelle Getty and Geena Davis.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is not your fathers Nora Jones!  More up tempo and guitars than her prior releases.

B0015DROBO|4.0|The plot of this novel was very interesting. I've read reviews here that found it slow, which surprised me. I found the story compelling, and moving along at a good pace.<br /><br />The main characters are well-voiced, but I did find that at times, Larsson is really stretching the readers' limits to keeping loyal to our heroes.<br /><br />For such a well-written book, for instance, Larsson uses the hackneyed detective genre convention of making his main character, Blomkvist,  a Lothario. In a book that is a self-professed analysis of violence against women (the original Swedish title is Men Who Hate Women), this is a strange choice. His casual attitude towards sex makes for a strange dichotomy with the violence portrayed by some of the antagonists. Along the same lines, at one point, his relationship with this daughter is addressed with a throwaway line \\"he was not a good father.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, so much time is spent getting to know Henrik Vanger, that when we find he's treated his relationship with Blomkvist in a way that surprises us, we don't get much of an emotional payoff-- it's just left up in the air.<br /><br />Again, I felt the plot was an interesting one, and certainly a recommended read, just be prepared for a small level of frustration with the character inconsistencies.
B002QGUFWE|3.0|I fell for the double album release hype and should have read the reviews, then I would have found out this version is censored. I would give this 4 or a 5 if it wasn't censored.

014241493X|5.0|To be honest with all of you readers out there, I had never heard of John Green before reading this book. It was highly recommended to me by my elementary school librarian (as we were discussing who gets to have a say in what books should be banned from schools because of their content). I also will admit that I am 29 years old. I decided that I wanted to look into this book she seemed to think was hilarious (as she points out anyone who raised teenage boys would get a kick out of it). Though I have not raised any teenage boys I found this book fun and amussing. I really got sucked into the character and was able to relate to him very well. I couldn't put this book down, I kept telling myself \\"One more chapter for tonight\\" and never stopped! John Green leaves you wanting more while reading this book. I'm glad that I decided to give this young adult novel a try.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition) (2009) surprised me and was pretty darn good for an old story that benefited from a new film approach. Many of the story elements were borrowed from prior Star Trek films. However, if you are a faithful Star Trek fan I don't see how you can begrudge this well done flick 4 or 5 stars for fruitful effort. This movie took Star Trek to a new high with updated screen images and action.<br /><br />Lots of action, good looking young stars, many improbable events (estimated by young Spock at less than 5% likely to succeed), and most of all a screen vision that featured numerous live action shots rather than the exclusive CGI approach so popular today. Honestly, when I am paying for a movie I want to see a film, not only a computer animation. In addition, the old \\"shake the camera\\" technique was used plus lots of new and clever live filming tricks were employed (including: the blinding light in the camera lens method and filming down against the mirror to reflect the image of the sky. This worked beautifully and fooled me into thinking just what the film maker wanted). These ingenious camera tricks are discussed in the documentary also provided in the basic DVD package.<br /><br />A youthful James T. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, and Checkov were all played by a good cast which looked very credible as younger versions of their older TV counterparts, and when necessary had excellent dialects. Even my wife liked this film and she was never much of a Star Trek fan.
1416594787|5.0|This book presents most of the powerful evidence for evolution.<br />At the same time, the author uses scientifically-supported facts to refute the counter claims of creationists.<br />He uses many examples of animals and plants to explain how they have changed and developed over time.<br />He also gives many examples of \\"intelligently designed\\" animals and plants that could have only been designed by a moron (Since no one believes that God is a moron - evolution lets Him off the hook).<br />His arguments are irrefutable, which is why nearly all biologists accept this evidence - with the only exceptions being staunch creationists who \\"refuse\\" to accept it.

0596522347|5.0|I didn't expect much from this book after reading the bad reviews. But since I was doing research on how to make the best keynotes I could I ordered it.  Much to my surprise this book was not even close to the negative written reviews, It has a great format with a solid beginning, middle and end, it has case studies of companies.  What I enjoyed about this book the most is the inspiration to create beautiful presentations, creating a purpose before starting a keynote through checklist for designing slides.  I really loved the book and for how much better my presentations are going to be now that I finished it, it's completely worth the price.<br /><br />I do have one thing to note, if you are a total beginner, it may be overwhelming to figure out how to go from making regular slides to mind blowing presentations, but the principals work for everyone,<br /><br />Buy This Book!!
B0001YRVN4|5.0|What can a star wars fan ask for, oh all three original star wars movies in a box set, well it happened. this box set is awesome. star wars is by far the best science fiction movies ever made. George Lucas is a genius. Thanks George for making such wonderful films.
B000TD0OYU|5.0|I think the Amazon third party folks made an error on data entry here.  The item sells for $10.99 at a high mark up toy store.  Maybe the intent was for a $9.99?  It is found elsewhere on Amazon for 24.49 [[ASIN:B000BVMAJ2 LEGO DUPLO Baby Zoo (4962)]] which is what about what I paid for it in May 09.    Anyway, it is a great toy.  My child loves it, plays with it almost daily, and it has been one of the go-to toys for 6 months and it shows no sign of a loss of interest.  I as a parent, I highly recommend the toy for the imagination it inspires in my child.

B0000041TD|5.0|This recording hardly needs another 5 star review, but after becoming reacquainted with it today I must  offer my two cents. Pavarotti and Freni, in their vocal primes, give heartfelt performances that capture all the joy, melancholy, sadness and nostalgia that is this opera. But just as importantly, Herbert von Karajan's highly pictorial conducting allows the orchestra to become as much  a participant as the principal singers. Except for short crowd scenes in Act II, this is a small scaled, very human work and the  lush sound of the Berlin Philharmonic might be an obstacle to some listeners, but rest assured under von Karajan the orchestra plays as nimbly as a string quartet. Although Elizabeth Harwood might not be everyone's first choice as Musetta  she's plenty good enough. This has to be one of the very finest performances of this work ever recorded.
0810983915|4.0|These graphic novels by Kinney are so much fun to read. They're quick and easy, but help to remind us all about the perils of middle school and growing up. They put \\"picture books\\" in an entirely different kind of category, walking the line between the often dark and ornate worlds of the comic books or graphic novels, and the simplistic messages conveyed by illustrated books for children. It feels very much like you're reading the journal/diary of a tween.<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller, [...]

B002W6Z0UK|2.0|Love Lady Gaga and I love this album, but beware: this cheaper version with just the 8 new songs is CENSORED!!!!
B00005LC1H|4.0|I understand John Cleese and Connie Booth wrote this series as well as acted in them. This is good comedy if you enjoy laughing. This is another one I wished would have had a longer run thus more episodes.
0920668372|5.0|This is my favorite childrens book. I love babies and give a copy to every mother I know either at her baby shower or as soon as the baby is born and caution her to read it on a non hormonal day.As I write this the tears are falling.It is truely a lesson in giving forward and unconditional love!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Yes, the series does lose some depth and intrigue without Lex and his father.  But, Smallville is still far more entertaining and thought provoking than almost anything else on TV these days.  Enjoy Smallville for what it is, not what some viewers wish it had become.  There are certainly flaws in Season 8, but the increasing darkness and new characters insure Smallville is still a show that shouldn't be missed.
B0013FSVES|4.0|Excellent sound and production.   Scotto's voice has declined (her upper range sounds bad), but she is gorgeous on ACT III where feeling and expression are very important.   Kraus's voice also sounds old, but his whole performance is good.   The best \\"Parigi o cara\\" i have heard.
B002KREVE2|4.0|If you are either a new LC fan or have been for 40 + years this is an excellent DVD.  My daughter saw Cohen live this spring and really enjoyed the show. However when I showed her the DVD from 1970 she saw the power he had at that time. an amazing career spanning 40 years, and this brings back memories when these songs were new and fresh.
B002HNA95E|5.0|A great collection from the one-n-only Queen of Pop. All tracks remastered with some unexpected edits (i.e. Dress You Up). Don't really know the reason behind the edit, but that's okay. To those who are still catching up to Madonna's work, this is a great compilation to have. For all those hardcore fans, the poster inside is worth the buy.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Easily $10 cheaper than Walmart or Best Buy.  I would totally recommend this.  Was a pleasure to watch in Blue-Ray.  Crisp and clean animation with a rollercoaster of emotions from sentimental to slapstick.  Also, Blue-Ray, DVD and Digital versions are included.  A total deal.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|This is a collection of 47 of Madonna's music videos spread over two DVDs with a running time of approximately 3 1/2 hours. This is more expansive than the thirty-six track CD counterpart. One of my issues with the CD version, asides from the unexpected track edits, is the non-chronological sequencing which makes hearing her artistic progression impossible. Thankfully the video collection are presented in order from earliest to most recent. The viewer, the fan is treated to a fascinating journey through Madonna's career, as her look and sound changes and evolves. While it would have been nice if this collection contained ALL of her music videos, the selection is more than generous. For those who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s listening to her, there's a healthy dose of nostalgia involved in watching these videos. And it should without saying that she has maintained a high level of commercial success right up to present day. I give this collection a 5-star rating.
B002HWRZH0|3.0|The movie, despite some glaring flaws, is a rolicking good time from start to finish. It looks and sounds delicious on blu ray, and that includes the deleted scenes and other special features. As for this 91 dollar \\"gift set,\\" you're really just paying an extra 70 bucks for the metal replica of the Enterprise that's included. It is very neat, good and hefty, though some of the details, particularly the lower part of the front of the nacelles don't look exactly \\"screen accurate.\\" I understand there were suppposedly only 5,000 of these made, and I do like owning the neat little statue, but geez, 70 bucks? Kind of disappointing. I should have bought the Best Buy \\"special edition\\" which for only 15 bucks more included four wearable, screen-accurate metal Starfleet insignias. Eh, what can you do?
1416594787|1.0|It seems best for me as a Holocaust survivor to start with Dawkins's references to that event. He equates Holocaust-deniers with those he decides to call throughout the book \\"history-deniers\\", and by them he means those who deny evolution (viewed mainly as caused by \\"blind\\", aimless, natural selection). What is more, he decides to call those evolution-deniers at times \\"40percenters\\", by whom he means the approximately 40% of the American population who are such evolution-deniers.<br /><br />In other words, those 40% of the American population are as bad as Holocaust-deniers. There is more. He says (all in chapter 1): \\"The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust\\"! At least? Does that mean the evidence for the Holocaust is not as strong as it should be? (Certainly not as strong as unapproachable Darwinism, I take it.) It seems this ingredient alone in the book confers shame on it, not considering that Darwinism can be held the major impetus behind the Holocaust.<br /><br />Another spectacular argument, frequent today but not necessarily of Dawkins's intensity, is the claim of how badly organisms are designed. Writes our author (p.371): \\"...the overwhelming impression you get from surveying any part of the innards of a large animal is that it is a mess! Not only would a designer never have made a mistake like that nervous detour; a decent designer would never have perpetrated ANYTHING [italicized in print] of the shambles that is the criss-crossing maze of arteries, veins, nerves, intestines, wads of fat and muscle, mesenteries and more\\". It seems, in this extreme human arrogance, not to occur to the author (no veterinarian he) that the brain of a human \\"decent designer\\" is likewise the alleged product of the evolution perpetrating such shambles.<br /><br />Of further interest may be the kind of logic employed by Dawkins, who attacks the opposition as \\"enemies of reason\\". Readers not in possession of the book can find the following discussed by him on his website, [...], in a video of his talk at the 2009 Atheist Alliance International Conference in Burbank, California.<br /><br />He argues as a reason for a single ancestry of all organisms the presence of identical constituents, of the same \\"alphabet\\", in all genomes, which, he contends, could have differed. Could they? He presumes to understand a lot. The identical constituents can be simply understood as necessary building blocks of life. Let Dawkins and colleagues build life out of something else.<br /><br />Life is also the preeminent factor in another of his illogicalities. He thinks previous attempts at finding life to require something more (\\"elan vital\\") than the operation of aimless natural forces have been discredited by the discovery of the \\"information\\" in genomes, through the mentioned alphabet, instructing other parts in forming the organism. Does this discredit the idea that organisms require more than aimless forces--forces with an aim? Organisms function in all their activities with the obvious aim of survival. And whatever the particular processes by which they operate, they do so in conformity with that aim.book can find the following discussed by him on his website, [...], in a video of his talk at the 2009 Atheist Alliance International Conference in Burbank, California.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm not a hardcore Star Trek or sci-fi fan, but I've enjoyed several previous Star Trek episodes and movies, so I'm receptive to the concept.<br /><br />This movie's acting, scenery, and special effects were all well done.  The characters were somewhat flat, but not to the extent of ruining the movie.  The general plot was (a) good guys ultimately defeat bad guys, with all parties experiencing losses along the way, and (b) a promising but troubled and nonconformist young man finds his niche and attains success, and thus becomes recognized by his peers as a hero.  This is pretty basic and predictable, but the action and suspense were still good -- the sort of movie that will keep you awake.  On the negative side, there were time-travel elements which generated the usual inconsistencies, and there were plenty of other subtler plot flaws, but I just went with the flow rather than wasting effort trying to make sense of these things.<br /><br />Beyond entertainment value, I didn't discern any substantial themes or perspectives on the human condition.  The closest attempt was an exploration of whether to live according to one's head or heart, but this was handled in a stereotypical way that didn't shed any new light (by the way, logic isn't the same thing as rationality).<br /><br />So, overall, this movie was enjoyable and worth watching, but strictly for entertainment value rather than anything deeper.
B002UXRH10|4.0|Rihanna certainly returns to the R&B scene with an 'unexpected bang'.  [[ASIN:B002UXRH10 Rated R]] is by far Rihanna's edgiest album and her most distinct album of her four previous releases.  Gone is the clean, tween fun of [[ASIN:B0018S6YOE Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded [CD/DVD]]] which was nominated for multiple Grammy-awards, winning one for \\"Umbrella\\".  'Rated R' delves Rihanna into her most aggressive work yet, rebelling against her 'good-girl' image in favor of a darker, bad-girl image.  Clearly a product of her environment, the listener quickly infers this new turn from Def Jam's golden girl is a result of her highly-publicized assault by R&B singer Chris Brown. One then must question was Brown's assault the true reason such an album by Rihanna materialized, or did Rihanna use that even simply as a springboard to evolve as an artist. My guess is it is a mixture and it is one that is both shocking though also brilliant.  While I question Rihanna's adoption of the 'parental advisory' symbol given her 'tween' fans, when I purchased my copy of 'Rated R', there were plenty of [clean] versions, making me wonder if Def Jam were thinking the same was as I about the marketing of such an agressive album by a star purchased by so many youth. Conjecturing aside, 'Rated R' is as solid as 'Good Girl Gone Bad' if in a slightly edgier, darker, and more bewildering way.<br /><br />The introductory track \\"Mad House\\" alerts the listener that this is like nothing else Rihanna has released. Gone are the tropical leanings that helped to build up Rihanna on her 2005 debut [[ASIN:B0009XFJ0O Music of the Sun]] or 2006's [[ASIN:B000EQ4G5K A Girl Like Me]]. Dark, brooding, almost frightening, \\"Mad House\\" serves as an appropriate lead in into 'Rated R.' The catchy, if dark-sounding \\"Wait Your Turn\\" is a fantastic opening track.  \\"Wait Your Turn\\" finds Rihanna asserting that she's \\"such a f**king lady\\", something she or Def Jam would've never dreamed of including on her previous studio albums.  The production work is exceptional and Rihanna vocally sounds the most commanding she's ever sounded.  \\"Wait Your Turn\\" is certainly not \\"Umbrella\\", but it bodes well in Rihanna's favor and keeps the 'rated R' theme of the album at the forefront.<br /><br />\\"Hard\\" featuring ubiquitous rapper Young Jeezy (who goes by just 'Jeezy' here) is produced by production team standout The-Dream (Terius Nash) and \\"Tricky\\" (Christopher Stewart).  An excellent choice for a second single following the darker, more somber \\"Russian Roulette\\", this track serves as the first to showcase the more overtly 'bad-girl' Rihanna to fans who have yet to purchase the new album.  Rihanna sounds good, even when she trash talks here (\\"That Rihanna Rain just won't let up\\".. \\"I'm gonna rock this s**t like fashion, etc.).  Jeezy continues to evolve as a rapper with another solid collaboration here. Surprising and equally shocking, \\"Hard\\" is just another chapter in Rihanna's evolution... if that's what you want to call it.<br /><br />\\"Stupid in Love\\" is dark in it's own way, favoring more somber production and 'colder' sounds (think 2006's \\"Unfaithful\\" or \\"Russian Roulette\\"). Well written, \\"Stupid In Love\\" finds Rihanna belting for perhaps the first time in her career, with the production placing her voices at the forefront as opposed to the background.  She sounds fantastic here and perhaps among the most inspired of her career. \\"Stupid in Love\\" is as potent as anything else.  The Slash featuring \\"Rockstar 101\\" is killer, finding Rihanna possessing the most swagger that I've heard her ever possess.  With one liners like \\"Got My Middle finger up, I don't really give a f**k\\", one instantly sees that Rihanna has turned to the dark side - at least for 'Rated R'.  \\"Rockstar 101\\" is easily a favorite.<br /><br />\\"Russian Roulette\\" is quite a valedictory performance, perhaps one of the best of her entire career.  Surprisingly written by the more adult-contemporary-leaning Ne-Yo, \\"Russian Roulette\\"is incredibly dark, without using the dark synths of \\"Wait Your Turn\\" or \\"Rockstar 101\\".  There is something that is unquestionably creepy, edgy, and chilling about this Rihanna performance.  It screams 'Grammy nomination next year'.  \\"Fire Bomb\\" is edgy as everything else, pinning Rihanna against more rock-leaning production work.  While it isn't my personal favorite, it is still a worthwhile performance by all means. \\"Rude Boy\\" proves to be another standout, with strong production work consisting of animated drums and synths, and a fine vocal performance from Rihanna.<br /><br />\\"Photographs\\" featuring will.i.am provides slight relief from the edgier moments of this album, without taking away from the extravagant heights Rihanna takes to make her point.  Enjoyable as everything else.  \\"G4L\\" returns Rihanna back to spacey, dark, edgy production work.  \\"G4L\\" is definitely one of the more disturbing tracks from 'Rated R' finding Rihanna once again lacing strings of profanities together with great facility (can you believe this is \\"S.O.S.\\" Rihanna?).  A standout, if shocking.  \\"Te Amo\\", produced by Stargate given the slightly lighter sound, still doesn't shed the minor key quality that has predominated this album.  Even if it slightly less satisfying than more overt numbers like \\"Rockstar 101\\", it is still above par by all means.<br /><br />Penultimate track \\"Cold Case Love\\" opens up with a distant organ sound, with spare synth lines entering in.  Rihanna sounds incredibly pained here, singing alone aside from the organ and the eventual addition of drums, piano, and strings. Beautiful, minimalist and unique in comparison to her past songs, \\"Cold Case Love\\" is exceptional by all means.  The album closes with the strong \\"The Last Song\\", a more restrained number (initially).<br /><br />Essentially, 'Rated R' is quite a capable album.  I'd even go as far to say it is one of 2009's best releases.  Even if some consider that an overstatement, it at least ties 'Good Girl Gone Bad' for Rihanna's best album.  Vocally, this album shows quite a great bit of vocal maturation from the Barbados superstar. 4 stars, easily.

B0012QCZ54|2.0|Saddled with a screenplay that wouldn't earn a passing grade in a Cinema 101 course, \\"Step Up 2 the Streets\\" is an urban fairy tale about an orphaned crew dancer (Briana Evigan) from the 'hood who is accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts.  But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school?  And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her \\"homies\\" from the old neighborhood?  Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets?<br /><br />You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to \\"Step Up\\" - sort of a mash-up of \\"Fame,\\" \\"Footloose\\" and \\"School of Rock\\" - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing.  And in that respect it delivers the goods.  So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film.  It's not much in the way of compensation, I know, but at least it's better than nothing.
0882709194|1.0|This edition offers erroneous information and 4 very important and relevant chapters are omitted. It sad that such a fine piece of scientific history has been distorted and molested into a tool for creationalist propaganda. The first 10 pages talk about how science is wrong citing quotes (which were clearly mined and taken out of context) and articles from the early 1980's (synonymous to using a computer from 1980 seeing how science evolves as quickly as technology). When Comfort tries to make a point about how 'irreducably complex' life is he includes nonfactual evidence as evidence! Typical of religious yahoos to willingly ignore and distort information to make a point. If you truly want to learn about evolution in a non-biased, logical, and TRUTHFUL way, this is NOT the book for you. This book is a waste of paper, don't buy it!

B002NWRMVS|3.0|In Norah's latest effort, she has continued the trend from her last album, drifting away from the sultry piano jazz she became famous for, and dabbling with various genre's of music and guest musicians. Her album will not disappoint the casual listener, and for those that love her voice, it's still there and never hidden behind any musical interludes.    Where I feel she falls flat is in the lack of depth her music holds. \\"Come Away With Me\\" was a album full of emotion and soul; something to drink a bottle of wine with a loved one or by yourself too. This album, while lyrically emotional, lacks the intimacy one might wish from Norah's past. I myself have a difficult time evolving when bands dabble in other genres -- and consequently fall in love with bands when they strike a correct nerve after failing.     This album will no doubt win Grammy's, but for those that expect another Come Away with Me, you may want to hold off purchasing this album.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|I am a fan of paranormal shows. Ghosthunters, Paranormal State, Ghost Adventures, Supernatural, etc. I watch them all.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity was good. It is certainly not as scary as the commercials make it out to be, but it is better than an episode of Ghosthunters. In fact, it is pretty much like Paranormal State.<br /><br />You may get a kick out of the couple's interactions, especially with the boyfriend's obsession with capturing everything on camera and playing it back on his PCs (he has a few).<br /><br />I won't spoil anything for you, but about midway through the movie, you grow a bit tired of the bedroom scenes. The ending is eventful, much better than the letdown that you get with the Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />One more thing...it is somewhat annoying that the time is displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen and the activity happens in the upper-left. The clock often plays an integral role by showing you how time passes overnight, but you are forced to take your eyes off of either the activity or the clock at certain points. At times, you feel like you will miss something if you look down at the on-screen clock. It would have been nice if they were both located on the same side of the screen. Perhaps this is just an issue in the theaters and wouldn't be such a big deal at home?? Or perhaps this is a deliberate device used by the filmmakers to facilitate the shock factor when you are looking away at the on-screen clock and something occurs...<br /><br />I watched this film in the theater early in the morning and by the time I went to bed, I was thoroughly afraid to sleep.  This film burns itself into your consciousness in a way no other film has.  I found myself thinking about it all day because the images it leaves in one's mind are so vivid.  At any moment, I expected to hear a loud bang or the lights to turn on in the hallway!  It is creepy to think that while you are sleeping, your spouse could...!!!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It really kept my husband and I guessing. Great plot for people who like a little more than just entertainment out of a movie. The acting is superb as well!
0792839730|4.0|This was an ambitious film that succeeds in its mission of entertaining the viewer, but does not quite make it into the top-tier of war films.  Operation Market-Garden was conceived by General Montgomery as an attempt to drive a nail into the coffin of the German Wehrmacht, and take the allies to the Rhine.  Instead, the operation failed and remains controversial to this day.  James Caan and Sean Connery in particular turn in excellent performances among an all-star cast.<br /><br />I suppose what deprives this film of its fifth star is the simple fact that (in my opinion) it has a bit too much action and not enough characterization and storyline.  There is just a lot of combat in this film, which is, after all to be expected.  And the action somewhat swamps the storyline.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent film that war-film buffs will enjoy more than once.  RJB.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Great perfomance by Nicole Kidman and what an amazing blend of vocals with Ewan McGregor! If you like good musicals, this is a must-have! The beginning seems really out-there, but stick with it and it'll all come together.
B002NOAF9W|3.0|\\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out!\\" is the best live recording of the rock era.  What makes it the best?  Well, start with the material.  The Rolling Stones wrote or chose to cover and include really good songs.  Next, give the material some scope and weight.  In this concert, the Rolling Stones sample the entire blues literature.  Without seeming effort, they take their listeners on a musical tour from deep in the Mississippi Delta through to Chicago and beyond.  This is quite an achievement for young men still in their mid to late twenties.  Then, improve (e.g. \\"Midnight Rambler\\") or make worthy changes to the material you (e.g. \\"Sympathy or the Devil\\") or others (e.g. \\"Carol\\" or \\"Little Queenie\\") wrote.  All too often, a live album is simply another greatest hits package under a different name.  So why should I complain?  Several problems:  1.  This album came out in the LP era.  To maximize the number of tracks on the album and put together two strong sides, the order of the songs on the album was changed from the order of the songs in concert.  There is no reason now, especially on a release such as this, not to restore the songs in the order they were performed in concert.  For the record, that order was \\"Jumping Jack Flash,\\" \\"Carol,\\" \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" \\"Stray Cat Blues,\\" \\"Love in Vain,\\" \\"Prodigal Son,\\" \\"You Gotta Move,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" \\"I'm Free,\\" \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" \\"Live With Me,\\" \\"Little Queenie,\\" \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Honky Tonk Women,\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man.\\"  2.  Bootleg recordings, e.g. \\"M.S.G. '69,\\" reveal the number of substantial overdubs made to the album, particularly to Mick's vocals.  Frankly, this CD set appeals to the serious collector of musical material by the Rollings Stones.  With all due respect, few purchasers are going to listen to the B.B. King or Ike and Tina Turner recordings more than once.  Instead of providing CD's of this material, it would be nice to provide the original live tracks on a separate CD.  Such a comparison of original live versus overdubbed released tracks would provide purchasers with real value for their money.  3.  There were other tracks performed during the tour, e.g. \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" which no doubt were recorded.  For completeness, it would have been nice to also include this as a \\"bonus\\" track for the serious collector who, again, is really the audience for this CD set.  As it is, that track can be found on the CD, \\"Liver Than You'll Ever Be,\\" the bootleg recording made on November 9, 1969 of the Second Show at the Oakland Coliseum.  This CD, an excellent audience recording, used to be widely available on the internet.  I do not know if that is still the case.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Good cast for the most part, except the one who played UHURU looked more like AHOOKER. Uhuru in the original series radiated an intelligent dignity, in this movie, you'd expect her to be transported to a Victoria's Secret show on Vulcan, after smooching with Spock. That being said, the FX are pretty good, although in some shots the Enterprise looks like the Enterprise Model Kit.  The opening is a grabber, but the whole plot is pretty much figured out in the first five minutes or less--even without a 23rd century computer. Interesting that the bad guy sounds more like a biker than someone from an advanced civilization--interesting or incongruous? Flawed, but fascinating, and well worth a viewing.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Michael Buble comes across as a superior Karaoke singer and nothing more. He sings the notes reasonably well in tune and does a fairly soulless impersonation of a Rat-Pack \\"wannabe\\". His looks appeal to women, particularly grannies, and he comes across as \\"squeaky clean\\" and innoffensive. These are his good points.<br />However, he sings with little or no discernible emotions and he seems to have forgotten to read the words of the songs he sings before singing them in order to develop some sort of interpretation of the songs he sings. He essentially sings happy songs and sad songs in precisely the same soulless schmaltzy \\"Las Vegas\\" style. \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Heartache Tonight\\" are two examples of how Buble doesn't seem to know what the songs are about and how he is more interested in filling up his albums with familiar, unchallenging and inoffensive repertoire.<br /><br />The album is entitled \\"Crazy Love\\", however if you're expecting a collection of highly emotive songs delived in a wildy passionate and unbridled way, then look elsewhere. As someone recently said to me, \\"Michael Buble is so 'middle-of-the-road\\" it is a wonder no one has painted a white line down the middle of him!\\"
0140143505|5.0|This is a funny, sweet story of correspondence that was a delight to read. It is a story told in letters between Helene and a bookstore in London. I am a fan of diary style, journal and epistolary style books and this book fits that style pefectly. The time period of the letters was from the 1940's through the early 1960's. Helene was a writer and enjoyed the used books the bookstore sent to her. She got to know the employees and their families and their lives through the letters that they sent back and forth. It is sad that Helene never made a visit to England. She tried on many occasions but something always came along that she had to put her money towards instead.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I thought the really hard to find / unreleased songs would be on this CD. Yes, they remastered the old familiar tunes, but I heard all of those before.    I was looking for these songs:   \\"Hey Kid, Come Back\\"   \\"Jesus Juice, Bubbles and You\\"   \\"Don't Call Me Freaky Unless You've Slept In My Coffin\\"   \\"Daddy - Round 2\\"   \\"Come To Wonderland and Bring Your Kids\\"   \\"On Second Thought, Just Send The Kids\\"   \\"Inject Me, Doctor, I Need A Nap\\"   \\"Bubbles Forever\\"   \\"You're too Old For Me Macaulay\\"   \\"Child From A Test Tube\\"   \\"Twilight Zone In My Bed\\"   \\"Money For Daddy\\"   \\"Doctor, You're In Trouble Now\\"  and...   \\"Get Up, Money Maker, Get Up\\"     Too bad, I really wanted to hear those songs once again.
B000TERK3C|5.0|This is a strong album with enduring musical riffs. I only lament that Amazon's sale pricing today is for the \\"explicit\\" version. I'm not a prude, nor do I wish to censor artist license (I don't think Radiohead takes it \\"too far\\"), but for the family iPod, I'm going to have to abstain this time. Bummer!
B002XSP16A|5.0|Susan Boyle more than fulfills her promise in this first CD. She shows a depth of understanding of the music, whether jazz or hymn, and a maturity and versatility that stuns.  An absolute delight!
B0013FSL3E|2.0|MOST ADULTS AND KIDS LIKE THIS MOVIE. YES I LIKE THE SONG FROM PETER G... THE MESSAGE OF THE MOVIE IS OK, AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT BUT...THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A DIRECT RIP-OFF OF #5 FROM SHORT CIRCUIT. I GUESS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A SEQUEL OF SORTS
B000001GXB|5.0|These interpretations are quite simply legendary. Pollini, especially in his earlier years, was a virtuoso of simply staggering technical ability. His recordings of [[ASIN:B000001GR1 the Schubert & Schumann fantasies]] and many of his earlier Chopin recordings are considered some of the great interpretations set to disc. He also recorded a very strong [[ASIN:B00000E2VA Emperor Concerto]] with Bohm and the VPO around this time. Here in Beethoven's greatest contributions to the sonata genre, Pollini plays flawlessly - with astounding dynamic control - and with his characteristic and unmistakable tone that carries a transperancy which verges on X-Ray, clearly illuminating Beethoven's musical architecture. Pollini is strong throughout, but shines in particular during the mighty Hammmerklavier, which is one of the finest recordings of this towering masterwork I've heard. Few take the massive first movement faster than Pollini, and none play it with the level of clarity, momentum, technique and controlled power he generates. Likewise, the scherzo and the fugue finale are rendered flawlessly. Kovacevich may play it a bit faster, but finds far less insight in spite of his strong playing.   These readings are classical in their way; objective, appollonian in conception, never lingering over specific phrases to make any particular musical point. Rather, Pollini looks to step out of the way, and put himself in complete service of the score. However, don't mistake his literal and unsentimental readings for a lack of power, as Pollini is appropriately muscular and visceral with technique to spare during the extroverted passages, playing with an almost inhuman precision that must be heard to be believed. Likewise, he plays beautifully, and more importantly schmaltz-free, instead generating emotional response through careful dynamic gradation and splendldly shaped phrases in the slow movements.  The sound here is very good, well-cleaned up in this latest remastering. I owned the original releases, and the sound is greatly improved here. There's a bit of brightness and the sound is at times close, but it's well detailed and never gets in the way of the music. Considering these recordings are more than 30 years old, it's pretty impressive how DG has been able to restore the original analog depth and sound field. The liner notes, like most of the Originals series, could be better, but I'm more concerned with the contents of the CDs than the booklet.  Is this the fabled Grail set? That can't be answered definitively. Fans of Beethoven's Late Sonatas will certainly want more than one interpretation, especially for music as cryptic and idiosyncratic as Beethoven's late language. Nevertheless fans of these sonatas will want this set as part of their collection, as this is certainly one of the great recorded sets. I would recommend additionally looking into the recordings of these works performed by Kempff, Backhaus, Arrau, and Gilels (sadly missing #32), so that you can listen to several different approaches, as they all work in their own way.     With all that being said however, if you asked me the proverbial \\"desert island\\" question, this would be my first choice and it wouldn't be a very hard choice.
B002NUULNG|4.0|The original animated scenes were given an Orton treatment. For those who are not familiar with the Orton effect, here is a synopsis - a blurred (out-of-focus) version of the image is blended with the original image giving it a smeared-color look. It is a matter of taste if this is an improvement.
B000002L7R|5.0|Prince is one of the Greatest Muscians in the world. i Love his instrumentation and musical arrangements which are written and played to perfection. And i always LOVE to hear what Prince has to say. \\"Around the World in a Day\\" is definitely an album to add to one's Prince collection if one doean't already own it.  And if u see Prince, tell him i Love him. :)
1416594787|5.0|This is a really enjoyable read - informative, entertaining and, as usual for Dawkins, combative.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I love this movie!  The Inn is so lovely I want to build a replica and live in it!  I am so happy that this wonderful movie is now in color.  Of course some outdated racial themes are in the movie--but that was in 1942....shows how far we have come!  Fred Astaire has some great dance numbers with Marjorie Reynolds coordinated to each Holiday.  It shows the wholesome values of America during WWII, and it takes me back to a glamourous Hollywood created adventure.  Christmas is only a part, albeit the best part, of the entertainment.  I recommend it highly.
B0013HQ2UG|4.0|Disraeli Gears is the second album by the powertrio Cream. It was released in November 1967. The album features classics of the rock music, like \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"SWLABR\\", and becomes one of the most important albums of the classic rock. The cover is a beautiful paint, and also, show to us all the creative from the 60's.
B00070DK14|4.0|Enjoyed this very much on vinly many years ago and finally decided to replace it on CD.
B001K61O6C|5.0|When I listen to this landmark album, I wish more artists would follow in these album-oriented footsteps where the individual songs behave like pieces of a larger suite.  And when I listen to THIS release of Marvin Gaye's masterpiece, I find myself wishing more music, both old and new, remastered with these sorts of audiophile sensibilities.  I daresay, [[ASIN:B001K61O6C What's Going On]] has never sounded better than it does here with Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs' Gain 2 system.<br /><br />The sound spectrum is perfectly balanced throughout and there is no unnecessary compresion of any kind to be found.  This Super Audio CD is demonstration quality!  What impressed me most were all the tiny percussive instruments throughout [[ASIN:B000VHMYTM Inner City Blues]] that sounded as if they were being played right in my listening and not simply coming out of my high-definition HSU RESEARCH horns.  I was impressed with everything up to this point, but the sound of those tiny cymbals played through a quadraphonic matrix was absolutely stunning!<br /><br />If everyone remastered Super Audio CD material as well as MFSL, the format probably wouldn't be struggling in the manner it has.  I just hope that MFSL will take a supportive look at the recent Direct Stream Digital Remasters of The Alan Parsons Project.  While some of those were very good for red book compact discs, a few, like [[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Pyramid]], suffered from an undue narrowing of the dynamic range since mp3s are the only format really selling these days.  Oh, how I wish the public at large would start using their ears demand quality as opposed to white noise.
B00007KMOX|5.0|Perfection which can always be expected from Carlos Kleiber.  Warmth, sensitivity and attention to detail.
B002NUULNG|3.0|I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed by the remastered version. Several of my favorite spots have been replaced by soulless CG versions, which seem jarring when interposed between cell animation sequences. I prefer the original voice-acting work as well. At some point, I just stopped watching, when it was clear it couldn't offer anything close to the experience of watching the original. At least the original version is included on the disc.<br /><br />Buy the disc if you want an HD copy of the original GitS (though i can't really tell the difference from the DVD, upscaled on the PS3... perhapss that's all it is?). The remastered version definitely has a cleaner, slightly more fluid look (higher framerate?), but if you already have GitS, I wouldn't bother with this one.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena puts together a splendid collection of the lesser-known carols and holiday songs. The Breton Carol needs vocals, other than that, I love the album!
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|Up until recently, I couldn't stand Gaga, and always considered her to be too gimmicky. I felt like her first album, The Fame, was full of superficial club tracks and filler. I didn't care for her, but I could recognize that she had potential, and felt like she could do so much better than The Fame.     I was impressed by the video for Bad Romance. Although I thought the song was pretty uncreative and too similar in too many ways to Poker Face, the chorus was catchy and refused to leave my head. \\"You know that I want you, you know that I need you,\\" sounded so much like Madonna, one of my all time favorites. I decided to check out the other tracks on The Fame Monster on Rhapsody, and was really blown away. The standout tracks for me are \\"Dance in the Dark\\" (so Depeche Mode, New Order, and Madonna influenced, very 80's), \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" (my favorite), and \\"Teeth\\" (very funky and sexy). Speechless and Monster fall a little short for me, but overall I like all of the tracks. I'm glad she decided to keep it short with 8 tracks instead of throwing some filler in that would have totally ruined it altogether.    Now, the reason I'm rating badly is because all editions of this album are censored. I really don't understand it at all, isn't Gaga supposed to be in your face, not caring what others think, and above all a fierce defender of the integrity and artistic expression of her work? Why on earth would she allow \\"Bi---\\" to be replaced by \\"Bit\\"??? Luckily, I read about the censorship before I opened the CD package, so I was able to return it. I'm a big girl, thank you very much, and edited versions just aren't gonna fly with me. I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to playing this album on repeat, but I absolutely refuse to buy it again until the original versions are released. Even Gwen Stefani says \\"sh--\\" in her songs. For an artist that breaks bottles, has sparks shooting from her breasts, and fakes her own death onstage, you'd think Lady Gaga would have grown a pair by now.
B002HWRZH0|4.0|This is Thanksgiving day.  I bought two of these for collector's purposes and I am not alone.  I've seen them on ebay, and other dealers have them listed here.  Its a good Christmas present, trekkers look to buy these for owning or collecting, hobbyists, sci-fi fans...then we're nearly at black friday...<br /><br />5000 units?  Seriously?  No numbers listed on them?<br /><br />These should have long since been sold out.  And the fact that this is an Amazon exclusive means Amazon has full knowledge of this being fraudulent.  There is zero chance this has not sold through.  DVD Talk and a number of Blu-Ray/DVD review sites did specific reviews on this product and it was featured in a few magazines I read for gaming.<br /><br />So AMAZON??????  What is the deal.  I am thinking about returning them if they're not limited and this is, in fact, a lie.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|He's a superhero who breaks every stereotype.  He smokes, drinks, kills without mercy and threatens even his comrades.  So it's about time that Marvel's fiercest mutant gets his own movie.  The first of the new \\"Origins\\" film lineup, it reveals Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) long, choatic past and the transformation that made him the badass comic fans know and love.  The film also explores his ties to William Stryker (Danny Huston) as well as his history with Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), which never came up in the X-Men movie trilogy (just one of many plotholes).    This film starts off well enough, with Jackman in all his roughneck, adamantium glory.  Halfway through, however, director Gavin Hood shakes things up a bit.  And by 'shake up,' I mean throwing other X-Men characters like Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) and a young Scott Summers (Tim Pocock) into the mix with no regard for story continuity or logic.  And then there's Hood's version of special-needs merc Deadpool; the only thing he did right was sew his mouth shut.  And even that doesn't compare with the movie's climax, which should have done more lasting damage to Wolverine but doesn't.  So while Wolverine is still the best at what he does, Hood apparently is not.    This film is rated PG-13: Violence, Adult Language.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Florence and the Machine is a cross between Tina Turner, Kate Bush and Siousxie Sioux. She has that flavour of eccentricity all good solo artists have, without being an abject embarrassment to her early fans. She screeches like a good-un; unfailingly loud and enough to disjoint and interrupt one's train of thought. In a genuinely magisterial/NME sense, she could already be construed as rock royalty because she is simply doing what no-one else is doing at this time. She should stick at it; or at least, stick at it until she becomes embarrassing.<br />And eventually, she WILL arrive there, depend on it.<br /><br />Her album is robust, pretty and all-weather. Just what you'd expect from something deliberately, forcedly unexpected.<br />It's no classic by any stretch, but the flame-legged one should be given the benefit of the doubt, for the sheer audaciousness of her altruism.<br /><br />What a name; like the Bunnymen and the non-existant Echo, or even a gory horror movie; THE Machine suggests some form of cinematic nastiness, some kind of sci-fi terror, mechanical and unfeeling. Florence and the Machine is very 'Metropolis', both in its obliqueness, and its darting modernism.<br /><br />She likes a laugh and a hug too, God bless her. Nothing austere or distant about Florence, despite the wailing and stomping. This what we need; direction, warmth and passion (and horrendous hype!), hidden deep in what appears to be noise and no signal.<br />People should be given medals for even attempting stuff like this.
B0026P3G12|1.0|Susan Boyle's voice does not disappoint, but the album certainly does. The songs are, in the main, poor choices, & the way they're run together without breaks makes the selection even more disturbing.  Because of the wierd amalgam, it's not an album I would happily put on & have in the background.  Would you want to hear Silent Night in June?    Then the arrangers sought to pack in as much as possible, so we have guitars twanging over a full orchestra and so on.  It is an incoherent mess!    I certainly hope her next album is better stylistically.  They should take a lesson from Gordon Ramsay: fewer ingredients so that all can be enjoyed.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful CDs I have ever purchased. Such a range of songs and her voice is magnificent on all of them. Lets hope she is accepted for the sweet and lovely lady she appears to be and makes many more recordings in the future. I would give this a five star rating and recommend it to anyone. No matter what your favorite type of music I believe you would enjoy this.
B0026P3G12|5.0|My \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" album arrived today. I am blown away. I was a music minor, so I have some idea of what I speak.  You are a wonder, Susan Boyle. There is not much I can add to the positive reviews, but I can say a few things to the negative reviewers. Are you too used to vulgar, rap, and toneless music?  Give me a break.  This album, and this woman touches heaven. What a miraculous discovery for us all. Thank you Britain.    I have bought three (3) albums at a time, so that Susan will be in all my friends' homes for Christmas.    I have already converted my album to MP3 so that I can finish my long runs with pure inspiration. As I run, I see Simon's eyebrows, and the standing ovation you so justly deserved.   Thank you for your courage and determination, Susan Boyle. You are a wonder.
0552998877|2.0|I really tried to sympathize with her. I really did.  But I hate the main character so much! I thought \\"you know, I understand her reasoning, I've done the same thing on my crazy shopping sprees too, etc etc.\\" But the main character is beyond ridiculous. She's not even reasonable, it's like listening to a retard. I'm struggling to finish - Urgh.
0060922583|1.0|This review is short and sweet.   I read the book with great interest and was happy to take as probably genuine the accounts of strange phenomenon and the ability of some people to perform miracles or super-human feats.   That is until I reached page 150.   There I read about Sathya Sai Baba.   He has an enormous following and is said to perform miracles and conjure gifts out of thin air for his admiring followers.  This I found just a story too far.  A brief amount of investigation plus a look at some of the videos on YouTube was enough to convince me the man is a sleight of hand stage magician.  If Michael Talbot can be conned into  writing about such people with obvious reverence an awe it doesn't say much for the rest of the so called \\"facts\\" in this book.   I shall persevere to the end of the book as I have paid out good money but to say I'm disappointed is an understatement.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Starfleet is made aware of a strange electrical storm, which turns out to be more than a storm. Oops it's a trap and George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) acting captain for 12 minutes, must sacrifice himself to save his crew. On this day was born James Tiberius Kirk. Kirk who leads a rambunctious childhood must find and fulfill his destiny.<br /><br /> He will unite with other characters with which Trekkies can relate. For people new to the genre the story itself sustainable and does not require any previous knowledge of the story or the characters.<br /><br />This is a great addition to the Star Trek tradition. They left no stone unturned all the major characters and the Gene Roddenberry feel is included. The CGI did not overwhelm the basic story. Parts my look like a power plant in Long Beach. Moreover, do we get Budweiser name recognition?<br /><br />There will always be people that will ether not watch this presentation or dis the story as growing up with the original TV or movies have no intention of rewriting the story in their minds. That is too bad that they will miss out. However, I understand, as I cannot stand to watch anything past the first three Starwars presentation. However is suggest you give this presentation, a chance as you may find that it has all the same energy philosophy and dialog that made the original.<br /><br />I've only seen the Blu-Ray version so I cannot compare versions however, the DVD was proud of itself being Blu-Ray and we have to sit through several minutes of coming attractions. The extras include the obligatory commentary by J. J. Abrams, Brian Burke, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, and Roberto Orci. There is also a BD-live option.<br /><br />All the other extras can fill a review in themselves. Most of the added material is duplicated in other presentations but it is interesting to look at the shooting locations.<br /><br />aka \\"Star Trek: The Future Begins\\" - Malaysia (English title)<br /> aka \\"Star Trek Zero\\" - USA (working title)<br /> aka \\"Star Trek: The IMAX Experience\\" - USA (IMAX version)<br /> aka \\"Star Trek (IMAX DMR version)\\" - Hong Kong (English title) (IMAX version)<br /> aka \\"Star Trek XI\\" - USA (working title)br /> aka \\"Star Trek: The IMAX Experience\\" - USA (IMAX version)<br /> aka \\"Star Trek (IMAX DMR version)\\" - Hong Kong (English title) (IMAX version)<br /> aka \\"Star Trek XI\\" - USA (working title)
B000V5TV22|5.0|Excelent GPS, I realy love it. I used it walking on streets, on Air Plane and car and locks to satelite very fast. It gives you 3D navigation.
B002E01LL6|1.0|Wow, I wish I would have read the reviews before I RENTED this piece of trash. The story is just plain slooooooow and just makes no freakin sense whatsoever. Lead actor looks like a wimp and acts like a cry baby and the fight scenes...bah. *** SPOILER****  I just love how they escalate the cash prizes so moronicaly fast like wth? Yeah, I'm going down to the bronx and punch one random guy and let another one steal my money and get away with it because it shows Im soo tough and ready to automaticaly have some random guy back me up for an underground fight...what? And lets not even get into the fact that he only actually has won two fights and now he's in the big money fights for 100,000.00? Did I mention his first one was for 5 grand lol. If you really want to see a fight vid go to myspace and type in cat boxing. At least it's more realistic with a lot more action.
0307454541|5.0|With nearly 700 reviews, many of them rave, I feel silly even writing one but what the heck.<br /><br />Having lost mucho dough in the economic downturn I had an aversion to the book out of the gate, it initially having much to do with economics and investigative reporting. However, I was soon swept up in the strange charm this book wields over most people who pick it up. It quickly becomes much more than a book about the markets and the media. There is something awkwardly dated about the writing and story, even when a translation is taken into account. The anachronistic effect of once trendy topics set in the context of a culture not your own (so the twists and turns, environments, mores and traditions are news - they drink an awful lot of coffee in Sweden and at all hours) renders the story both fresh and familiar. This quality adds to the charm and vibrant mystery of the novel. And while it is not in the least devoid of a dark side, creepy scenes are energetic and exciting but not so murky they left me wanting a shower. Also, the computer geek, so exhausted a character at this point, felt new and unusual - not at all clich&eacute;d. It is a fully engaging, unique page turner.
B001993Y2C|2.0|Space not the final frontier but the soap opera frontier.  The old Battlestar Galactica was corny and bad acting; at least some people in the new BG are good actors (but definitely not most).  But the writers are terrible, couldn't you have been more imaginative and not reused plots or themes from the original crummy series?  Women in high heels and short tight skirts in space?  A supposedly smart woman gets breast cancer because she never got mammograms?  Not very smart and very soap operatic.  She also wore high heels and short skirts; she was a really stupid person.  Gimme a break.   Lots of talk, over the top acting or really bad acting (like the woman who played Kara).  The action scenes were repetitive, but then again when you're stuck on a group of crummy space ships and hardly land anywhere, there's little room for imagination.
B0002HYC8C|5.0|I am a huge fan of Playmobil, grew up playing with them myself, and I am so glad I invested in this toy for my daughter's seventh bday. Now, the toy is a bit pricey but it is worth every penny! The toy comes with loads of accessories and animals, it is easy for little hands to set up the animals in the ark thus cutting down frustration. The ark does float but not that well when it is loaded with all the animals and accessories, said this my daughter loves to play with it at bath time.
B0026P3G12|5.0|[[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]]  My pre-ordered Susan Boyle CD arrived yesterday and did not disappoint. The songs are about Hope, God and overcoming rejection. With her renditions of \\"How Great Thou Art\\", \\"Up to the Mountain\\" and \\"Amazing Grace', Susan makes a convincing case that spirituals can be Scottish. She is the first I have heard since Aretha Franklin that would be compelling as a soloist singing a cappella - such is the resonance, nuance and variety of her voice. Accordingly her CD is best when she keeps the backup simple. Often she relies on a piano or guitar accompaniment. Her album ends with a quiet and enduring \\"Silent Night\\" which will be on my iTunes Xmas playlist I play through the holidays.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This is one of the most boring books I've ever read.  Ther author kept digressing from the story with facts that were barely connected.    I found the book preachy and trite, using all kinds of gimmicks, but in the end what is the lost symbol?  No more Dan Brown for me!
0307346609|5.0|Brooks' portrayal of the rise and fall of humanity was brilliant, and all crafted through the lens of a global zombie war.  The oral histories become a little repetitive at times, but that's somewhat to be expected.  Only the toughest members of humanity survived, and we'd expect them to have endured some suffering!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|this album just nails it on the head no bull just good old speed/thrash/death if your a longtime fan this album will grow on you just as all slayer albums do...
B001Q8FRMQ|5.0|Bored?  Have you heard it all before?  Try this record: the logical conclusion of all Pop preceding it, and the antecedent to most of what has followed.  Including sumptuous Pop, cool Jazz, stinging Rock, and sensual emoting, you probably have heard this record before, but you may not know it.  This record echoes in the subconscious.  It's hot. It's cool. It's hip, it's nostalgic... it's a timeless classic.  For an average American, it's a true sophisticate's discovery and an unexpected journey. For everybody, it's instantly enjoyable, yet also challenging, a bit frightening, funny and, most of all, lush.  Whatever this is, specifically, it's not been done better.
B002X20W2E|5.0|Well, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by this CD.  I didn't want to like it because I thought it was too dark.  But, after hearing the songs more it's grown on me considerably.  It's a challenging CD, to be sure, as is the packaging.  But as a whole, it's probably one of the stronger pop records to come along in a while.  Rolling Stone called this CD \\"goth R&B\\" which is a pretty good description.  Other descriptions I've heard were \\"hard-pop\\" and \\"harsh-pop\\" \\"dark-pop\\" or \\"confrontational-pop\\" (lol). It's simply pop music that is rough around the edges.    The first three cuts, \\"Mad House,\\" \\"Wait Your Turn\\" and \\"Hard\\" are like the introduction.  \\"Mad House\\" is actually the invitation or warning and \\"Wait Your Turn\\" and \\"Hard\\" set the tone for a darker and more aggressive Rihanna.  I wish \\"Mad House\\" was longer, actually. I liked the layered harmonious and ominous circus feel to that track.  Rihanna sings \\"Come on, come on, come on in....\\" and I picture some somber and crazy looking woman standing on the front porch of a dilapidated house like \\"Fight Club,\\" (lol) motioning in a leery passerby to come join her in her house of pain.     The fourth song \\"Stupid In Love\\" opens with the line \\"Let me tell you something, never have I been a size 10 in my whole life...\\"  This was a great opening and I take it to mean that she found some other girl's belonging in her boyfriend's things.  The rest of the lyrics are more repetitive and simple. Overall it sounds like someone hitting themselves in the head and saying \\"Girl, you are so stupid!!! Stupid! Stupid!!!\\"  There's a lot of self-loathing and regret in this one and it feels real and raw.  One of Rihanna's better vocal displays.    Next up is \\"Rock Star 101\\" and it goes the complete opposite direction in that now that she knows she played the fool, she wants to drown her troubles in a wave of partying and aggression.  Playing a fool for the guy in the previous song has taken a beating on her self-esteem and her \\"swagga\\" and girlfriend wants IT ALL BACK.  The song isn't really rock and there isn't a guitar solo (Slash is the featured guitarist). But, it does have rock elements in the heavy, crushing wall of sound created with the synthesizers and guitar.   This works nicely after the self-defeating \\"Stupid In Love\\".      Next up is the brooding \\"Russian Roulette,\\" which was a very unusual choice to kick off this project.  This is a challenging song and it took guts to release it first.  It seems this song is about how love is a dangerous game of chance.  The use of metaphors was lost on some listeners who take everything literally, but I appreciated it.      Then there's \\"Fire Bomb\\", which is quite a lovely surprise in that it's more rock and upbeat. The tone is a bit sunnier, but the words are not. She wants to take her no good man out with her in a blaze of glory!  She makes it sound almost beautiful, though.  You really picture a long, hot summer road with two troubled lovers racing each other.  This song is fantastic and has potential to be a radio hit.    \\"Rude Boy\\" is an upbeat song basically about quick meaningless sex.  After a bad break up, some go this route.  The beat is nice, but the song itself is forgettable.     \\"Photographs\\" follows \\"Rude Boy\\" and it has a pretty but soggy melody.  It kinda reminds me of \\"Save A Prayer\\" by Duran Duran.  I cannot stand Will.i.Am's rap part, though.  So annoying.      \\"G4L\\" is a dud for me. This seems to be a fave for some because Rihanna talks a lot of smack here.  I'll have to give this another listen, but it was the only song I really did not care for.     \\"Te Amo\\" is a winner!  This song makes good use of her accent and the beat really makes you think of some place tropical.  Beautiful song about unrequited love on a dance floor.    \\"Cold Case Love\\" is up next and it was co-written by Justin Timberlake. This is another strong cut.  Loved how it continues to build, although the ending is too long.  Great vocals from Rihanna and top-notch production.  I can hear the ache in her heart on this track, as I can on \\"Stupid In Love.\\"    \\"The Last Song\\" closes the CD, of course, and it does so with beautiful vocals and guitars.  I guess it's like she's saying this my last song about this soured love affair.  I'm leaving it all on the road and now I am done. I've had my say!  I kinda like the sad, airy ending to what sounds like a very passionate, tumultuous and violent ride.  I am glad Rihanna decided to share the experience because it makes for a fascinating journey.  I never thought Rihanna, of all pop stars, could make a CD quite like this one.  It reminds me of Christina's \\"Stripped\\" in that it's a break from her usual sound and it's more personal.  Janet's \\"Velvet Rope\\" is another example. \\"Rated R\\" is a more cohesive work than those CDs, however.    Much love and respect to Rihanna for not repeating herself with \\"Good Girl Gone Bad Part II\\" or trying to cover up her pain with music her heart wasn't into.  She has co-writing credits for at least 8 songs that I counted and she is an executive producer as well.  It is good to see someone so young taking a hands-on approach in their career!  Now I look forward to songs that turn inward more and discuss what it's like to stand alone and eventually learning to open your heart again.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I read the other reviews here; in turn buying the product. I went from being decent and non-religious about practicing to having a need to practice and the ability. My other amp is 100 watts. This is an inspiring piece of machinery ; the tone is astounding and the features I give 5 stars. The aux hook up is brilliant. Enough reviewing, time to continue upping my technique! Fast shipping, marvelous seller. you will not regret buying this.
031606792X|1.0|Well, I thought the first three were decent read for young adults, the second and third being the best because Myer obviously had a better editor - it was sans spelling mistakes and tad less redundant.    Breaking Dawn seriously lacked in all departments. My biggest complaint is there isn't any character progression. I always thought Bella was kind-of whiny and annoying. In the three previous books with her going on about how she can't understand why Edward is with her (frankly I don't understand either) I thought there would be a change. She would whine about it almost as often as Myer found slightly different ways to describe Edward over and over again. Ok, we get it! He's hot! Redundancy isn't really a good thing. It's like listening to your grandmother tell the same stories over and over again, it makes me want to stick-a-needle-in-my-eye.     To me, Bella's lack of character progression brought up the question of: What would a 100 year-old vampire possibly find in common with an immature, 16 year-old girl? Myer tries and fails to put Bella in I'm so mature-for-my-age and different role. Just because she likes classical music doesn't make her and old soul. I expected her to come into her own, gain a little more self-confidence and a broader view of the world. In the end she's still extremely sheltered and self-serving teenager.  I couldn't believe that she was allowed to get married then soon after have a child.  If she had one iota of adult-like maturity she would've listened to Edward and waited. She was nothing more than a self-serving, infatuated seventeen year-old who wanted what she wanted, when she wanted it. She got married out of lust, had a child to complement her idea of what playing house should be like, when clearly she's still a child herself. I'm a young adult and I have to say that's certainly not the best message to be sending to all the teenagers out there who love the books so much. It's like saying, \\"Hey, let's not care about our family or anyone else's needs or desires, lets lead people on to make ourselves feel better about our situation, dump them and make the rash decision to get married and raise a child with someone after knowing them not even a year. That's a great idea!!    The climax surrounding her child was a serious let down as well. Where's the true action, the excitement. It was built up only to fall flat, \\"Ok, everyone that's it. Renesmee is one of us, go home.\\" No life lessons, everyone gets what they want and no true excitement. I kind-of feel like Myer just pushed this book out in order to meet a deadline. It's probably why Summit only made a deal for the first three books. They took one look at this one and were like, \\"Um. Alright, yeah.... No.\\"    On a positive note, Jacob did seem grow throughout the series. Even though his pedophile-like imprinting on Renesmee was a tad uncomfortable despite Myer's attempt at making it innocent, I enjoyed his character. And I have to say Kristen Stewart did a decent job as Bella in the films. She left the sniveling-whiny Bella in the pages of Myer's books.
0446614459|2.0|This is a very good book!  I was disappointed with Amazon as the cover was torn when I received. I purchased this as a new book...
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Great series missed the first episode on TV, but now got the DVD well watching all over again, can't wait untilsecond series starts. Well done to amazon came well before estimated delivery date.
0142004413|5.0|This is my favourite book, bar none. I first studied it in school which should have been a reason for disliking it; instead I have fallen in love with Durrell's autobiographical description of his somewhat dysfunctional family, their gang of eccentric friends, and the fauna and flora he studies and collects ardently and for the seemingly magical island of Corfu. Overall a hillarious and very warmly and beautifully written book. My only regret is in not having a similarly magical childhood.
B000YA9YJY|5.0|mAN!! if you really like old school rock n roll, with classy hard guitars riffs and great drum beats that makes you think you are back in 1970-1978 ....so this is a MUST HAVE album!!! i just get to see the album cover at my local retail store (in mexico) and i just couldn't get my eyes off it, it is so provocative and intended to make you want to listen to it, so that is what i did, i just bought it and i don't regret it!!! even though media is saying wolfmother is: \\"the new led zeppelin/black sabbath/deep purple fusion\\"....it is totally ORIGINAL NEW MUSIC of their own style, but yes i gotta tell you...this album has that vintage style that is classic in the recognized 70's band as i mentioned.... I GIVE IT A 10+
