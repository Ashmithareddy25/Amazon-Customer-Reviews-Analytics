B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I learned of the diet plane from a man who lost 65 lbs and was still going.  I like the theory behind the diet.  It is easy, and very livable, as you only &#34;diet&#34; two days a week.  10 lbs the first month was great.  My scales hadn't been in that area for many years.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|I, initially thought that I was not going to like the show but saw it and really liked it. Can't wait for the new season
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was absolutely riveting. The story had took a turn I was NOT expecting at all! In love with this book!!
B00A6WSTIW|3.0|good action/monster movie but the early CG graphics sometimes missed. Gotta love LL Cool J the cook. some good surprises along the way
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Me Before You a Novel had a very slow and sad start. But if you stick to it this becomes a VERY interesting book.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|great action and good story; the ending was a bit loose compared to the rest of the movie but it was very good.  marky mark has matured into a pretty solid action hero and he displays it in this film
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Its simple, convenient and a great cloud player. It plays all music that I purchased from Amazon.com. Very pleased!!! Thanks.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|A compact, easy to use sharpening tool. It won't give you the best edge, but it will give you a good one quickly.
B007SGM084|5.0|The storyline was a little tough to take at first.  Then as I progressed through the first book, I began to enjoy the trilogy.  The story line is good, the descriptions are graphic, and the ending is innovative.  I even learned something from reading the trilogy. Yes, I`d read this trilogy again.  Well done E. L. James.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This is fun to do.  I like how it has different modes (zen, infinity, etc) to choose from.  Makes you think ahead a few steps.  I like that challenge.  I have so much fun with it that I end up playing it for two or three hours at a time!
B005K17RU0|5.0|A very good app that I am pleased to rate and review. Does exactly what you want it to do.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Many horror films have been made before and since The Exorcist. But nothing has come close to the sheer terror created in this masterpiece. Watch it alone, in the dark. You'll never be the same. Tubular Bells will continue to play in your mind forever.
B005544V6A|5.0|So fun and good streaming.  I'm glad Amazon is getting so many shows. Maybe the screen could be a little bigger.
0385535147|5.0|I am a huge John Grisham fan!  I loved The Racketeer.  John is one of the best storytellers around.  He does especially well with thrillers!  I always look forward to his next book!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great story for Grisham fans. The story moves quickly and keeps you on your toes with a &#34;who done it&#34; twist.
B004FECNIO|5.0|This is one of the films that I couldn't wait to finally be released on Blu-ray. I knew that the Blu-ray format would greatly enhance this film visually. The original director died and wanted Steven Spielberg to complete the vision for this film. I can see why. With all of the detail necessary for this sci fi movie that is set in the future, I don't know of another director who could have handled everything necessary for this film to be done so well.<br />The film has an excellent cast with Haley Joel Osment as the primary character for the film David. Frances O'Connor and Jude Law were also excellent in their supporting roles.<br />Artificial Intelligence is set in the future. Human society has been dependent on robots for quite some time. Humans seem harbor negative feelings and even sometimes hatred for the very A.I. that humanity created. A.I. are targeted so much that some of them have to become fugitives and hide in order not to be hunted and destroyed.<br />&#34;David&#34; was created as a replacement for the gravely ill son of a couple. Frances O'Connor's character as the mother can't accept &#34;David&#34; despite his desperation to please her and need for her to love him. &#34;David&#34; can't understand why. When O'connors gravely ill son suddenly improves, &#34;David&#34; is eventually forced from the home and left in a wooded area to fend for himself.<br />David runs into other A.I. who are fugitives and hunted. He gets some help from Jude Law's character another A.I. While on the run with Jude Law's character you see a lot more of this futuristic world in the film. This futuristic world is filmed with great detail and vision. At some point in the distant future after humans no longer exist, Aliens come and rescue &#34;David&#34; reactivate him and try to help him. The only thing that David wants is to have his mother back again. The Aliens let him know that their technology will only allow them to give David his mother for a very short time. For Davidit's enough to enjoy a short time again with the mother he loves so much. A.I. is a very touching story due to the depth of David's love for the mother who rejected him.<br />Steven Spielberg does an excellent job with this film and the special effects are so great that it's visually stunning. What truly makes the film A.I. however is the superb acting by Haley Joel Osment as David.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is worth the couple bucks I paid. I usually don't pay for games nor do I leave reviews but this is worth it. Good graphics. Sometimes moves are easy &amp; other times you have to think things through. It is just overall a fun game. I love it.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I love the television series Bones for several reasons. First of all I enjoy forensic science shows. This show has a great ensemble cast and the story lines distribute the writing nicely among the primary characters of the show. The humor in the writing is what I love best about this series though.<br />Season 6 is one of my favorite seasons of the Bones series. It has episodes with humor and some with intense drama. Season 6 is also the pay off season where the primary characters Bones and Booth finally start to get together as a couple.<br />I already wanted to buy season 6 to add to my dvd collection. Amazon sealed the deal for me with a great sale on this season at the time.<br />Bones season 6 is a must see of this series.
B005723JSQ|3.0|So...this book was recommended to me and, honestly, that's the only reason I trudged on.  Once I got about halfway in it was entertaining enough to continue through to the end.  Entirely predictable and so ridiculous it was hard to read at times, but it had it's moments that had me not want to put it down.  If you're a romantic, you may enjoy it more.  The whole footnote thing, which I can only assume was intended to be clever or at least cute, was entirely annoying.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more without the purpose-less footnotes??  I suppose I'd class it as \\"an easy summer read.\\"  Yea...that seems fair :)  But I probably wouldn't seek out additional reading from this author based on this experience.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|James Cameron showed great vision as a director on this movie. I can see why it took quite awhile to even make the movie. James Cameron took great care with down to the smallest details on this movie. It also took awhile for technology to be able to catch up in order to make this film. Visually Avatar is stunning. The colors on Blu-ray are awesome.<br />I enjoyed Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana's acting on this film. Sigourney Weaver was so great in this film in the supporting role that I had to appreciate her as an actress all over again. I even enjoyed Leona Lewis's lead vocal on the closing song of the film. The song shows that Leona Lewis has quite a vocal range.<br />For some reason I wasn't able to appreciate this film as much as I should have when I saw it in the movie theater. I am so glad that I bought this film on Blu-ray. I was able to appreciate it fully in this format.<br />Avatar is one of the films that enjoy well enough to watch again whenever the mood strikes me. I count it as a must see for true fans of sci fi.<br />I am really curious what James Cameron will do for the intended sequels to this movie.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|This show is funny, suspenseful, exciting and creative too.  I've seen it several times, and still like to watch over again!
B0017XFBMG|5.0|SOME DUPLICATIONS  -  BUT GOOD AS ALWAYS - SOME SELECTIONS I HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE - BUT MISSING SOME OF MY FAVORITES
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a fast paced mystery.  Everyone you know has read it ....you should too.  It's a best seller for good reasons.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it was enjoyable.  Science fiction fans would probably enjoy it.  It did keep my attention enough that I watched it straight through without pausing for anything.  It has a 'Matrix' kind of feel to it although it isn't as action packed as The Matrix movies.  SciFi fans, give it a try.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|If you are a fan of the mission impposible series. I really think that you will love this movie. it was a great watch!
B00DU74U74|3.0|I doubt many people who haven't read the book are going to rent this title (based on the not great reviews here and everywhere else).  If you have read it, then you are probably curious like I was about wether or not to see this film...I found it mildly entertaining but the many variations in plot disappointing... My sister, whom hadn't read the book, said she found it confusing in places and wasn't a fan overall.
B00005YUFK|5.0|FAN-TA-STIC!!!  A must-have in any true music lover's collection!  A master compilation from a master musician...and his trusty ensemble of musicians.  ;)
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app was listed free as a promotion. When I downloaded the app I was charged 4.99.  Maybe amazon will read this and return my money.
B0036SXQEA|5.0|Great move, performances and intrigue! I also watch this at least once a year. Love moves that depict unique interconnections.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This is Justin Timberlake's best album yet.  Keep them coming.  I love having the music on my phone anytime I want to hear it.
B007SGM084|4.0|The story line was pretty good and the sex &#34;scenes&#34; would make Jackie Collins blush, but by the 3rd book I was sick of all the sex.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I like to see if I can beat my previous times.  there is no better game out there right now.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Bought this for my friend who is a huge Eric Church fan and he loved it!  Not much else to say.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This was an easy read that touched on many of the issues that those of us who believe in the idea of energy transfer and in the concept of unlimited abundance.  It also provided practical ways in which one can experience the power of energy.  A great read.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Much more frightening than the movie!  I didn't sleep for a week!  But I enjoyed it very much!  Definitely recommend.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I had no idea what the outcome was going to be and now I'm worried the next one in the series will keep me up all night, again.<br />Really, a scary, good read.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Excellent book, well written with twists and turns and a few surprises. Very well worth reading and highly recommended. Delivered to my Kindle instantly.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|1) I can't find out where or even if edited photos are being saved, 2) the stickers cannot be appreciably sized down, 3) I cannot find a manual or a valid faq page on how to use this app, 4) there is no real settings menu, which means that you cannot customize your app.
B004S4YY4C|5.0|A great read. I thought I had read most of Follet's books but I had missed this one. I really enjoyed it.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This book had a lot of drama and I mean a lot of drama. Some parts were difficult to get through because of the fighting among characters especially the H/h. The off and on again relationship between the H/h seemed to drag on in parts. I would suggest you take the characters as they are, this was a very disfunctional relationship. They seemed to love, as they understood it, each other but it was exhausting trying to keep up with the feelings.<br /><br />The writing was very good however and you wondered if this relationship would work out. I would certainly give the author another try.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading it but was extremely disappointed.  It jumped from character to character and new story to new story and was just very confusing.  I do not recommend this book at all.  Don't waste your money.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|iT IS THE BEST SHOW ON TV, A MUST WATCH, ONCE YOU HAVE SEEN THE STORY LINE IT IS HARD TO WANT TO SEE EVERY EPISODE.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|this is fun and addictive even after havering a few strokes. my grandson watches for the gopher and laughs. great for working a injured brain
B003F46RVO|5.0|I've seen this movie about 20 times and still love it makes for a good relaxing movie night,lol I must say
B00992CF6W|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this app. It is by far worth the money. Must get this app. It is the best sandbox game ever.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|Wow! This version is awesome. Comes with the album and a bonus disc with 3 additional songs and also a Best Buy exclusive song \\"Naivete in Black\\" which is a kick-ass song! Comes with a t-shirt with the album artwork on the front of the shirt. Get this version, it's to cool.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app. I play it all the time. A great time killer. I highly reccomend Hill Climb Racing. Plus its free.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great plot, it became a scoche too negative and  heavy  on season 3.  Viewers watch ro see the cast win, remember loyalist are so vested it changes them when events happen.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Its a good app but you cant add text, that my only thumbs down. Haven't used it enough to know if its worth the $5 tho...
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Jack Reacher was much more!! love the Jack Reacher character but the movie did him no justice! in this case reading the book was more thrilling.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I think that these books are some of the best books I've ever read. They are extremely witty and well written.
B005LJITS0|5.0|i enjoyed thins very much! Super heros are the what we need even if  they're real. I can watch these types of movies again and again!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have always loved the Jack ryan books and now there is new generation. The book was. A fun and fast paced read. For those who are fans of Clancy you will like this book
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Call it folk rock, country, whatever.  This guy is good!  Unique voice and top notch lyrics that pull you in to his stories/experiences. Excellent first release.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Convoluted plot with both election rigging and mafia money by different parties trying to destroy the same family. Ends on a cliff hanger. Presumably, another boom to follow next year. The first three have been quick, easy, fun reads, but they could have been one novel. Of course, there's more money to be made by elongating the tale and charging three times.
0375507256|5.0|Bought it forever ago, totally worth the $30 (give or take). Came in perfect condition and had no tears whatsoever.
1454704225|5.0|This book has some great drawing prompts from 18 well-known artists. I love how each artist takes a different creative approach to making their art.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|It really is not possible to give less than 5 stars. Terrific movie!  I really enjoyed it!  Incredible story and incredible family.  Who couldn't fall for the father! Manages to be both a funny and deeply meaningful film
B003O86FMW|5.0|Man that is a good read. I guess when you get comfortable.with the plot about hunting and killing it lets you focus on getting to know the characters. Can't wait to jump into the next.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great headset! Would recommend highly!!!<br /><br />Surround sound with noise canceling is just amazing!! Has great range too.  I am very happy with my purchase
B004ELSDZK|3.0|This is fine. I just don't ply much and don't have much to compare it to.  I'm just in a mood to review stuff.
159315724X|5.0|This book may be little in size but huge in information. What an invaluable book to own and so interesting to read.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Amazon does not do a good job of giving age ranges for kids apps.  This one is good for my 3yo girl.  Several different games to choose from.  Best Dr. Panda one yet.  There are lots of different veggies and different things to do for each veggie &#34;grown&#34;
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like puzzle games and this is both easy to play but still requires some critical thinking. A bunch of levels! Might get a little repetitive after a while, though... app works beautifully!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was a little wary of this game while viewing it in the Appstore, but I decided to give it a shot and try it out.  Boy, was I glad I did!!!  This game is the most inventive mystery riddle problem-solving addictive game EVER!!!! Being a 13 year old who loves mysteries, riddles, and 3D puzzles, I finally found one that has all of these elements... and MORE!!  Sure the game is a little shorter than I expected, but at the end, I found a mysterious note saying more Rooms are coming... hopefully this means there will be more exciting challenges in the future!  This isn't a game that just leads you through a series of mindless events... you really have to pay close attention or you will miss out on very important details.  This game was definitely worth the $2 I paid for it!!!
B000W04S6U|5.0|This album is fantastic! All the important themes are there, it's great background music that makes any job feel epic!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and kept me very entertained (: just want to keep playing. wish there were more levels to play and they were much more difficult.
1616550414|5.0|this is the book of book for zelda fandom! includes arts, character profiles, maps, explanations and everything! is hard covered and finished whit neat golden letters.
B000NY12LO|4.0|It took me a little while to get the jumping time line, even though they tell you at the beginning of the chapter.  Once I could see the time line feeding to the other, it was better for me.  This book really makes you think hard.  I believe a person would need to be in the right mind set for the book to be at its best. The reminder of the ripple effect of how we treat others is very well written.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hey epic girl I agree Whif u plus I always have had to play it on my daddy's phone now I love it cuz now it's on the kindle Fire ps if you like my comment by me please hit yes pps if you watch Dragon ball Z, one piece,episode 40 ep.I'm on, sailor moon, those who hunt elves,or inuyasha please hit yes!!!

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great acting. I've got my favorite characters. The story line is very entertaining and they're all beautiful people (except Louis). But It's a great show. Story line carries on well from the first season. I'm hooked for the third season.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Still a classic after all these years. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to get through it.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|This is a perfect light romantic comedy for date night.  Get some popcorn, a bottle of wine, turn down the lights and enjoy the ride.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|At first, I was very reluctant to buy this, now I don't regret it. I'm usually against buying unnecessary gizmos and gadgets invented to make life easier than it already is, but this one has proved to really help in a lot of areas!<br /><br />Convenience:<br />My son would always spit out (on accident) and lose his paci mid-sleep, so we find ourselves getting up many times a night just to put it back in his mouth. This acts a \\"paperweight,\\" so when he spits it out, it still sits right at his lips, just incase he decides he wants it again. Over time, as he starts to gain more control over his hands, he's learned to grab the monkey, itself, and bring it closer to his mouth. He has also learned to recognize the feeling of his \\"monkey.\\" If I place any other stuffed toy near him, he'll ignore it until he finds his monkey, lol.<br /><br />Efficiency:<br />Oh, and this is GREAT for never losing anymore pacifiers! We've lost 2 before we decided to buy this! Once we got this, we've never even come close to losing it since it's practically a toy!<br /><br />Avent SOOTHIE attached:<br />There IS one caveat -- don't buy this unless your baby ALREADY LIKES \\"Soothies\\" (which is the type of pacifier that's attached to the stuffed toy). If your baby is already used to orthodontic pacis, he/she may not like switching over to this type of pacifier.<br /><br />This VS. clip-ons:<br />I like this more bc it also acts like a toy, and it helps their fine motor skills when they learn to grab and grip onto things. A clip-on may also get in the way when you're trying to pick them up or hold them. The toy also helps to avoid letting the nipple part touch surfaces.<br /><br />ONLY CON:<br />The pacifier is permanently attached, but this is only a minor issue to me. When washing the paci, I don't mind getting the toy a little wet. It dries pretty quickly. And I try to clean it as soon as it gets dirty from milk or anything else. I also wipe it down occasionally.
B0053KWDES|1.0|The &#34;out&#34; headphone jack only worked in certain, very finnicky positions making this product practically impossible to use while walking and annoying to use while stationary. I emailed the address provided in the pamphlet that comes with the product and still no response over two weeks later. I've ordered another amplifier from a different company. Hopefully the competing brands will satisfy as this product most certainly did not.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Thouroghly enjoyed, inspirational, I reccomend this movie for everyone? It's a must see for the entire family. That's all I have to say
B009WUBERW|1.0|I was hoping for some entertainment, and all I saw was a bloody, gory  body count and a mindless disappointment.

B007D2XSW0|2.0|Same as everyone else...I can't save on my galaxy s3. Even when I choose custom and tell it to save to a specific location, it's not there. I've tried multiple locations, it's no where.
B00C7APVU0|5.0|Second only to Ad Astra in SB catalog. Apollo conjures, Ian Gillian, DIO, and classic groovy screamers on this offering. The keys harken Purple. Modern guitar hero picks from his own heroes hooks at every turn, you've heard it before, but Mikey freshens it. I love this record.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I had this DVD years ago, but it wasn't the extended version.  When I misplaced the old DVD, I purchased this DVD that included the extended version.  I will not misplace this DVD.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Jesse David Leach's first studio appearance since the metal classic &#34;Alive or just breathing?&#34; Hard to top the continuity of that classic. But &#34;Disarm&#34; is as good as this genre gets. Adam has the best guitar tone these ears thirst for. BUY THIS RECORD!!!!

Other Members Damon Johnson (Brother Cane), Longtime Lizzy Axeman Scott Gorham, Bassist extrordinare Marko Mendoza, and Veteran skin basher Jimmy DeGrasso (Suicidal Tendencies, Y&T, Megadeth, MD45, Alice Cooper) Pretty good starter album...worthwhile track &#34;Bound For Glory&#34;. It is the best Lizzy song since Phil Passed away.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|Good at first, but doesn't hold up as well as Nolan's Batman soundtracks for repeated listening. The extra songs are mostly unmemorable recuts of the main one. The scrapbook track has good bits, but again, are just a rehash, and get lost in the middle of the 30 mins. Also, the HD digital download thing (not Amazon's) is weak - requires DRMed app, etc.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|A B+ read for those of you who love animals but despise cutesy talking bears. This tale has moments of \\"not-being-able-to-put-it-down\\" which is a rare treat these days.
0785156593|3.0|I saw a lot of good reviews for this and tried it, but...it was pretty much meh in my opinion.The WWHulk stuff is a better option.
B003Y74KCK|4.0|Good quality cover.  With a screen protector, completely protects the phone, and keeps it small.  Of course except for the Apple Logo.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Read this with my daughter for her first time. Really enjoyed sharing this classic with her. She wants to read the whole series now.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|With the movie being so widely anticipated and crowd funded, I became interested as to why. I delved into this world of social classes, and Hugh school angst. I was so enthrall we with Veronica and her exploits that I just couldn't stop watching. This show has skyrocketed to the top of my favorite shows of all time. It is amazing. You will love every second. This show was before its time, and a loss to the TV show audience.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After reading book 4, I swore I would call it quits.  Just too much verbosity on food, clothing, etc.  However the story is an intriguing one and I suspect I will buy book 6.  However, if Book 5 was the first I read, I would not buy another.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|FUN and challenging game.  Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzles and likes the challenge of solving the clues to escape. ENJOY.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|It's ok on my phone but I liked it better on my Kindle Fire, maybe a little faster, but fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best free game! It is fun and very addictive. It is challenging but great because I can reach goals to move to other levels. Works great on my Kindle HD!

0307887448|5.0|Science Fiction's golden age passed decades ago and we've had to suffer through endless dark fantasies that had little to do with our possible future, but when I finished reading this book I realized that it's still alive and well.<br /><br />The plot -  The year is 2044 and James Halliday, one of the richest men in the world and creator of OASIS, an online virtual universe inhabited by much of the world's population, dies and  leaves in his will all his fortune, including control of OASIS, as an \\"egg\\" hidden in OASIS, the most complex computer game ever created. Though millions play, five years after it begins no one has passed the first of three gates, or even found it. Then the scorecard on the Halliday website announces that Parzival, an online player who is known to the reader as Wade Owen Watts, a teenage orphan boy in a trailer park, has passed the first gate and the race is on.<br /><br />Not only individuals play. Giant corporations are in it too, like IOI (Innovative Online Industries), which has thousands of employees hired to do nothing but hunt down the egg. But Wade and some of the other players in the lead soon learn that IOI is not above also hunting down and destroying its competition.<br /><br />What a story. And Cline does it justice. The New York Times has said the computer gaming aspect of the novel takes over to the detriment of the novel, but that didn't bother me. I don't play computer games, but I had to keep turning pages. And Oasis is about much more than games. It's free to anyone with access to a computer system and Halliday established schools on it where the poor of the world go to get a free education. Wade is one of the students.  You can also work in OASIS, and millions work there because there is no longer work for them in the \\"real world\\". Needless to say, \\"reality\\" has become problematic for everyone and Cline explores that to the full.<br /><br />Ready Player One is entertaining, but it's not a superficial book. It presents a complex, fascinating vision of our possible future. The book is apparently headed to be a big budget movie which doesn't trouble me either. As long as it's done well, it will be a blockbuster.mplex, fascinating vision of our possible future. The book is apparently headed to be a big budget movie which doesn't trouble me either.

B003O86FMW|2.0|this whole book is filled with whiny pathetic characters (especially  katniss)  and had a boring storyline . and then theres the love is it Gale or peeta?? Gale Is a pathetic character and peeta is so nice to everyone :) so y is he crushing on whiny pathetic gale lovin katniss? my favorite  character is peeta hes so kind and gentle and good with words he makes the whole book worth it with out him theres no story
B003SNJYSK|4.0|Overall a good read but I preferred The Leopard also by Nesbo.  The first part of the book is sometimes hard to follow but sets the basis for the rest of the story. The translation is not perfect and some sentences seem a little odd but one usually get the just of what is trying to be said.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love the casting!  And the plots are great - Cumberbatch is the perfect Sherlock as is Watson.  Looking forward to the next series, but hate it is the last!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed this short book. It gave. A brief look into a great man who's mind was so far ahead of his contemporaries.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I truly love this series, and I am thrilled to be able to have it in my dvd library permanently.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What can I say, I love John Grisham's books. I've read every one of them, and I've pre-ordered his next one for my Kindle. As long as he writes 'em, I'll read 'em and enjoy 'em. I recommend you do the same!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I truly love this series, and I am thrilled to be able to have it in my dvd library permanently.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|A truly different and very valuable slant on the presidency, the men who have held it, and; the relationships formed. It's probably the closes thing we Yanks have to the Brits House of Lords. While the Senate has its role of advise and consent, so it turns out do the former gents who occupied the the White House, who would have thought? Fortunately, the authors of this book! An important and enjoyable addition to our understanding of our country!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft!! It's really fun and I can design my own shelter!! It runs smoothly on my kindle and the graphics are gr8!!  I can play anywhere I want and no WiFi is needed. Finally I can bring minecraft on the road
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|This a great album!! All of the songs are catchy and they blend together nicely!! Looking forward to more music from Capital Cities!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought it was fun and very super cute the minions are just perfect and delightful I think it should definintly be rated the best game ever TRY IT!!!!!!!!!:):):):)::-):-):):)u will love it!!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|It was exciting. Keeps your interest. Not what I was expecting but was better. Only thing I would have changed was some of the language. Could have done without the &#34;F&#34; word.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|is very good for bronys except for story part.especialy that doctor hooves and lyra are there.......but i wish doctor whooves had the TARDIS for a house!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't believe you killed your great actor in the last season, but you will come up with a great husband for a replacemet.  I love this story because there is not any filthy language,
0316228583|4.0|If I hadn't trusted what an incredible author J K Rowling is, I would have tossed the book. She seemed to have dispensed with her skill to engage the reader into a main character, but trust me, she pulls it off in a most backdoor fashion. The characters are flawed, human, and eventually... vivid. Only well into the book, do we get the insights and compassion we have seen in good ole Harry & company. It's a side of life we don't usually seek out for casual escapist reading. Nearly half the book is spent in giving us the seamy side of her characters before she lifts the veil and we see beneath the sheen of their delusions of themselves. In the end, they recover some deeper introspection to their attempts to appear perfect. This is not a perfect world. It is a world of \\"work in progress\\" and a messy business it is. I find myself assessing how giving and caring I've been and will become, as this book distills itself in the trickle down aftermath of reading. It's a tough read and poignant to the point of painful, but Rowling always takes the higher ground, bringing depths to the most vile, uncovering the twists of fate that created the Snapes and Vordemorts. Even our beloved Dumledore emerged with flaws. In \\"Casual Vacancy\\" we come to know the deceased Barry Fairbrother through his profound influence on others' lives. She shows us that we are all capable of more... more depth... more compassion... more humanity... more beingness... and gives us this excruciating set of examples of what not to be and do, and then, what we could... if we dared... BE.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|Great movie even if you're not a Star Trek fan.  If you are a trekie, and you haven't seen this, it is a must.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I could hardly put the book down. An intense and riveting story. If you like a high energy read this is the book.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I watched the trailer for the streaming video and thought if they had played that when the movie was released I would have seen it in the theatre. It had just enough action without being overkill, the elements that make sci-fi fun, and a story that kept you guessing and thinking. If all you are interested in is mindless plots and non-stop explosions then this one is not for you.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|Love ColdPlay. Great Concert. Great Image and sound. Useful PopUp Menu. Did not like it does not includes bonus features.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|I didn't realize that this was adapted from a book until after I rented and watched the movie. I then read the reviews and noticed that most people who are disappointed or downright hated the movie have read the book and didn't like the adaptation. Having not read the book I can honestly say that as a stand alone movie it was enjoyable. It was beautiful to watch, had a great cast, fantastic costumes (Ridley's was the best), and all around fun story. I would have given it 3.5 stars but since that isn't an option I enjoyed it enough to adjust up. It seemed to be lacking in depth but I don't watch obviously fantasy romance for deep meaning and life lessons.<br /><br />The only real complaint I might have is that as much as I love Jeremy Irons and his performance, his voice is so distinctly British and try as he may he does not get rid of enough of his accent for the Southern drawl to sound anything but a strange cross between the two. Emma Thompson, on the other hand, is wonderful in her accent and character.
B0019HQIFE|4.0|It would be a better concert if it would have included scenes from concerts in bigger places. There's so many good songs from John Mayer that I missed some of them at the BluRay.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Warning: may contain some spoilers (but will try to keep from divulging too much).<br /><br />First, the good:<br /><br />1. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were wonderful as Clark Kent's Earthly parents (see \\"the bad\\" point #1).<br />2. Clark before embracing his Superman side and out on his soul-searching journey was interesting and fun to watch (see \\"the bad\\" point #2).<br />3. The evolution of the battle on Krypton and it's demise was interesting (see \\"the bad\\" point #3).<br />4. The kid who was mean but grew up to become the manager of IHOP was amusing, what little there was of him.<br />5. Lois Lane investigating Superman to figure out who he was.<br /><br />Now, the bad:<br /><br />1. The method of Dad's death was ridiculous. There was no reason for that to have played out the way it did; it came across as contrived and forced.<br />2. Once Clark became Superman and allowed himself to fully embrace that role he became even more sullen and rather lackluster.<br />3. The battle on Krypton, like all the battles in the movie, went on too long.<br />4. No matter what they did to each other, no one from Krypton was able to injure each other in any fight until the last battle and the manner of death was nothing that we haven't seen humans do in war movies.<br />5. Thousands, possibly millions, dead and Superman only reacted to save a human when he saw that it was Lois.<br />6. Having never been a fan of Superman but willing to give him a try since he was no longer wearing his red underwear on the outside (much like the Batman revamp), I went into this movie hoping to like it but found little redeeming in the plot or Superman himself.<br />7. I never realized it was possible but there was so much action that it got boring. I almost fell asleep several times. I would jerk back to awareness just as a battle ended thinking that it was finally over only for another battle to start moments later.<br /><br />I could go on but, really, my last point summed up the worst part ofthe movie. I hardly blame the actors but rather the final cut person who thought this much action equated to engaging and entertaining.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|The plot unfolds beautifully as each character faces their own obstacles leading to the satisfying resolution. Even the soundtrack is great and really expresses the mood and personality of both the movie and the main character. As Juno forms and reforms bonds with everyone, I found myself with more and more adoration for her and the other characters;each is lovable in their own way. I would recommend it to teens and adults alike,anyone that loves a laugh,good story, or a glass of Sunny D.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|It takes a lot to keep me watching a movie without searching the web or doing work while the movie is playing. If I watch the movie without distraction I know it's great -- much of this movie I spent surfing the web. It has two actors I enjoy, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Atherton, neither of which disappointed in their performances. My issue was a bland predictable plot and way to much gore. The fight scenes were fun and Renner's character had some snarky amusing lines that kept the film from being boring. I don't not recommend this movie (it is not the worst Hansel and Gretel movie I've seen recently) but don't go into it with high expectations and you won't be disappointed.
B00597A6NU|5.0|To begin with, i love those flying fortresses (among other WW2 warbirds) so this is already a plus on that perspective. Combined with some good action backed up by true events, and you have a GREAT movie to enjoy ..
B0040I09RM|5.0|Although it's called SOA it could be loosely referring to a more common MC that has a reputation for being rough and maybe somewhat criminal. This is a work of fiction though that I really got into. Each show draws from the last and creates an ever widening web of lies betrayal and mayhem. I loved it , plus I ride every day so hey what the hell.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I downloaded the Angry Birds Rio app to my Kindle Fire HD so I could play it with the grandkids on vacation. It was a wise choice. We had a blast. Of course they had played it before but I like the Rio version a little better than the original version of Angry Birds. The kids loved the monkeys in this one and we can enjoy it each time I see them. Well worth downloading this one.
B009ZQNN90|4.0|It is easy to see why this movie was also made into a successful musical on Broadway. It is a real feel-good story that cannot escape the attention of its audience. Kinky Boots can be compared with Priscilla Queen of the Desert, but in my opinion, Priscilla is still the queen!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Seriously, I bought this series before heading on a cruise with my family and read all 6 books.<br /><br />I knew after just the first few chapters that it was probably a mistake, but I sucked it up and finished all of them.<br /><br />Before going into the negatives, I will say that there were parts of the story that were fairly engaging in a simplistic way.  Unfortunately, after the first 3 books the author started trying to add depth by being long-winded - which made it hard to keep reading in some places.<br /><br />Here are my major complaints:<br /><br />1) Every romantic attachment was immediately felt by both parties as absolute 'true love'.  If a male character awoke from a comma and was being tended by a female healer, the book would go on for pages about how he felt a new sense of 'love and wonder' and couldn't believe he had found somebody with such courage and honesty.  Come on!  They haven't even talked yet.  How could the character know anything about the girl's honesty?<br /><br />2) The timeline is really messed up in some places.  There is one case where every minute of the main character's life is documented for a large portion of the book.  Then he realizes how much his pet has grown.  The problem is, even though a lot of pages have been spent, it's only been a couple of days...<br /><br />3) The characters are constantly looking at each other with a new \\"Sense of respect and wonder\\".  I got to a point where I would laugh every few pages when something like that would come out.<br /><br />4) Every time the main character and his friends head to battle with a 'couple of guys he hadn't met before' - you can absolutely guarantee that those poor unknown slobs aren't coming home alive.  It felt like Star Trek in that sense. :)<br /><br />5) The main characters are unbalanced and unrealistic.  In some cases, they can slaughter hundreds of enemy soldiers with no help, other than their well trained horse.  In other cases, just a few soldiers are insurmountable...<br /><br />6) As the story builds, it becomes more repetitive.  It reads like the author is trying to stretch it out.<br /><br />7) My biggest complaint is that the story didn't end after book 6!  It wouldn't be a huge deal if I enjoyed reading it; but, I guess I'll never find out how it ends in book 7.  (Assuming it does end there.)<br /><br />Anyway, I won't keep going, other than to warn you that this may not be the best choice for your next series.<br /><br />This is one book where I would highly recommend reading the first few pages before committing to a purchase.  If it seems like a good story to you, then great!  I suspect, on the other hand, that you'll agree with me after getting through the first few pages.ntable...<br /><br />6) As the story builds, it becomes more repetitive.

B00CWVGNS8|3.0|The 2002 movie Yossi & Jagger was an impressive drama that lingers in your memory. Yossi is much lighter and it is therefore not fair to compare the two films. It is worth watching, but will not be remembered.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|challenging to attempt 3 stars on every game before moving ahead.  great game and great when you need to kill time.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|Despicable Me is a fun movie with lots of laughs. It is &#34;fresh&#34; to the animated movie scene but not on the same level of satisfaction as the Shrek and Ice Age series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book I did not read the first one I saw the movie but this one I read and it is excellent
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Without Barbra, this would probably have been just an &#34;okay&#34; movie. She however lifts it to a higher level and the surprising climax is definitely worth the wait!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Really cute movie. I have to admit, there is something just a little creepy about the dog, Sparky, in his reanimated state. But he shakes that stigma off and comes out as cute as can be long before the movie is over. There is a very real possibility you will feel the same, and be forewarned, this story just might make you shed a tear. One very nice touch was the soft, gentle soundtrack theme that sets the perfect tone. I'd give 4 1/2 stars, but since I can't, I gave it 5.
B007REV4YI|5.0|We have all the 007 movies, including the original Casino Royale.  My wife was the original James Bond nut, but it didn't take me long.  Daniel Craig does a great job as 007, and this feature does not spare any action.  There is a very surprising/upsetting change in this movie, but all things come to pass, and James will return again.
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Cool story bro! I was so scured I dam near pissed myself! Go on an watch it. I dare ya.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I have always been a pro-space exploration guy, and this movie really hit my fancy.  There has to be somebody else, somewhere, or it's a lot of wasted space.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Ramin and Sierra have the most amazing voices. They give all they can to their roles and it shows. The love, fear, and hope that they show each other in this, is impeccable. This really is a must buy for any Phantom fan. The DVD and its box were in amazing condition, no dings or scrapes. 100% worth the money!
0811879542|5.0|the review I received from my 5-year-old nephew and 8-year-old niece is two thumbs up!!!<br /><br />An excellent book for those who want to use their imagination
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The life stories of numerous interwoven characters over 50 years of Afghan history. More of a psychological study than a drama. Absorbing but not a \\"page turner\\" like Kite Runner.
B000001BZT|3.0|Bought this on a whim as have seen Steve around town and had heard some of his music growing up. Some good songs and some bad songs. Not particularly what the guy is about from what I've been told.
1416563156|5.0|Not only did the recipient love it (6 year old boy), but his aunts and uncles who grew up with Indy loved it as well.  All thought it was really 'cool' and felt authentic.  Great book!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This was not one of my favorite books from Mister Gaiman. I think the antagonist was a bit too bizarre and where she originated from didn't jive with me. It was entertaining enough, but I'd probably not suggest it to anyone.
0425266060|3.0|Waiting on the next installment. The series was a great read but I just wished it included the last book. Waiting on pins and needles.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|This movie had a couple of white knuckle moments, but the stupid ending ruined the whole movie! I want the 2 hours back!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The app was great until it updated. After it updated it kept on telling me update available got to the app store amd I couldn't play ever again.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|I have never been one to critique music and to each his own I say. That being said, Imagine Dragons is one of my favorite bands. I finally got around to buying the album rather than watching it on YouTube. I would highly recommend both seeing them in concert as well as this album.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Built my first APU system and used this. Couldn't be happier and very impressed on how this performs with Windows 7x64 pro. And I have to say. With Prime I got it in 2 days for free:)
B008745B32|5.0|This is the first Waugh novel I have ever read and I read it more out of duty to a friend than expecting to enjoy it.  I am now a Waugh fan and will begin working on his others.  He is a marvelous writer with a delightful, wry sense of humor.  And he tells a great story.  If you don't know his work, give it a try, even though he apparently has a very low opinion of Americans.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This help guide is as useless as tits on a bull. Not every level is included in the guide. It contains general strategies, which would be useful for beginners, but not for people who have been playing for a while.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Have read all of Michael Connelly.  But my fav is Harry Bosch.  Keep Harry active!!  The plots are always unique and have great twists.  The Black Box is no different.  I loved it !
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I like because it was so funny it made me laugh through the whole thing and I would recommend this book to many different ages
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was good, didn't know what to expect. Didn't totally wow me but it was worth seeing. I was comparing it to the original too much which is a classic.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I just can not pass this one level I love this app a lot it is very fun and I want to beat it
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Would have rated a 5 but not quite. Good movie. Could have been a little more action, but I like hardcore.
B0077JAXDQ|4.0|This is an actual model that you will need to build. You'll have a good time doing so and don't let this stop you. There is another version that comes built from Revoltech if building this little guy isn't your thing!
B003M6FGTE|4.0|The subject matter is a little mature for younger kids, but I love that it deals with todays issues that teenagers deal with.  Teen pregnancy, bullies, sexual orientation.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I'm a huge Harry Bosch fan. I love all the books. Concrete Blond is one of my favorites. I wish they would make it into a movie like they did Lincoln Lawyer.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|This is a very entertaining and thought provoking book for children and adults! The letters from the crayons show a lot of character and assertive qualities that could easily be discussion points in a classroom.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I downloaded the app with the ability to sync on several devices. The app still needs work in the functionality department but overall its a good app for free
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I prefer to play against the computer instead of other gamers. At least it was free so I could easily delete it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|loved it needs more colors but other than that I love it, I would recommend it to any one. Thanks
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|A lovely display of how an individual takes a craft and works at it day after day to become a master. The craft then becomes a passion, a vehicle that invites self-exploration. The craft becomes part of the individual, a pupil woven within the embroiders of his passions; soon he will know, he will know that he may now call himself a master. And even so, after becoming a master at his craft, he learns, day after day, that a master is only at his highest when he humbly accepts that he will forever linger within the universe of learning.<br /><br />A must see, suitable for children and individuals of any age. I used to be unappreciative of sushi, but after watching this movie and understanding the craftsmanship behind it, I certainly look forward to try sushi from experienced hands.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Kinda sucks doesnt let you look  at comments, comment, read description, or have suggested videos. Only good is its in HD sometimes. Not worth your time, thankfully it free or itd be a waste of money
159668139X|5.0|This is the greatest resource book! I have used this book constantly since I learned to weave 9 months ago. I refer to it for every project and it is my go to book for any problems I have ie. broken warp threads.  It is very easy to follow and well written.  I love this book!!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Exciting show with nonstop suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Twists at every corner and surprises in every episode.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Bought this to read while vacationing at the beach. I had seen it on the NY Times Best sellers list forever. Decided to give it a try. Awesome book! Loved how it was written. Lots of twists and turns through out. Would definitely recommend!
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|I expected a little more going into this movie. It has a great story plot but the movie itself just ran a bit slow for me. My daughter wasn't even remotely interested and asked me to turn it off after just 30 mins. It was a little hard to get into and I just felt a little disconnected from all characters.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The perfect combination of quality and price.<br />The product arrived to the destination as it has been suggested (in a relatively short wait period).<br />Great headphones for home and pro. recording studios.<br />Very clear sound ...<br />Of course I will advise all my friends involved music production.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie! It has a great cast, most of which I had no idea could actually sing. It is so funny! I spent most of the movie laughing. I love the line up of characters and found myself routing for them. The soundtrack to this movie is amazing, I am amazed at how well they all harmonized. I would recommend this to anyone that wanted a good laugh or likes shows like Glee.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|enjoyed the show when it was available on a weekly basis and now I have the ability to watch the series again.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Many movies that are based off of books fail to deliver when it comes to the movie. I do admit that it does have somethings that are different from the book, but they are also on a time constraint. I think that they did a pretty decent job modeling the movie off of the book. I think the cast is amazing! The acting is awesome. I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|Who could not love this movie? It is a classic, pure love goes out to this and Ben Stiller. I'm hoping for the new 2nd one to be made soon!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I really didn't enjoy this movie. I was looking for something more of a comedy, especially with Paul Rudd, but what I got was a poor attempt at funny. I hate it when you expect something to be hilarious and then the entire movie gets very serious. It was more of a downer than anything. I wish I hadn't wasted my time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will make you think you will definitely not want to take your eyes off this book I felt like I was watching the movie
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie is so adorable. If you have seen the other movies you have to see this movie. All the original cast is back and a few new people as well. It has humor that will both appeal to adults and to children. My daughter loved the movie and so did we, I actually purchased it after renting it from Amazon on Demand. I actually liked this movie the best out of all the Ice Age movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved every moment of these books and the ending was spot on! I can't wait to see this story on the big screen!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Never gets old.  Always keeps my interest and I love the characters they have great personlities. The writers are exceptional.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I can't find out how to have on the player name tags on our heads, I'd like to Sprint, sneak, have an actual nether, go to the end, villages, actual caves, and have more mobs.I just don't know how to have some of these on the settings, or when an update is out.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|It works and looks nice. I guess there really isn't much more to say about it. I would recommend it.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|If you are a fan of Die Hard movies, you would like this one.  Lot of action.  I recommend it.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|I had never seen this except for what Wall-e liked...he was right, it is a great movie to watch with someone you love
B009WUBERW|5.0|Very entertaining movie.  Great cast of action stars from years gone by.  Waiting for the third movie. Watch it today
B003O86FMW|4.0|Book 2 was just as engrossing as Book 1, a worthwhile read. On to Book 3, Prime account makes it super affordable!
B00821OX98|5.0|I heard Howard Stern talking about his show so I checked it out. I watched the 1st hour of the pilot with my 11 year old and it was a bit intense for her - so she had to watch a mermaid show for an hour to &#34;cleanse&#34; her mind of the alien visuals and intensity.  The next day I watch the season 3 finale.  Now I'm all caught up and only had to invest 2 hours.  Yay!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Really alot better than the picshop lite,i was excited when i saw it was free!! It has more options for editing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you are like me and you have always wanted a way to mirror whatever you are watching on you tube to your TV, then this is your lucky day. This device is small, cheap and does the job very well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have the original Kindle and it has been great. The newer Kindles look nicer and do more  but unless this one breaks down or is lost it's the one for me. It travels with me all the time.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sanra Bullock plays a great role, but its the story that is the real star.  Based on the true story of Michael Oher, it really encompasses the full spectrum of human emotions.  If you don't come away from this movie with your heart moved, you are broken inside.  ;)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|We love the DS versions of this game, so I was very excited to find the app for it.  My son and I play this together and it's wonderful for logic and imagination.
B00CEK9OTM|2.0|Too hard to control make the game easier to control anyway it's boring waste of money even know I got it on the free app of to day.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I thought it was a better movie for him, much better than the Jack Reacher he starred in, just not his movie
B00AVF8USS|5.0|What a great movie! The quality of the streaming was also excellent. I would definitely recommend this to and Amazon Instant Video to anyone.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|not what I expected, it was a good movie but not up to the quality I expected from the actor.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|This series is absolutely beautifully done. Since it's based on comic books and that it involves a superhero, there tends to be a couple of cheesy lines, but the writers handle this perfectly; they foil their own cheesiness like they're admitting to it. The flashbacks are brilliant and I love that we get to see how Oliver grows as an individual and as he gets closer to being \\"The Hood Guy\\". We get to watch as Oliver goes from playboy to scared kid who's way out of his league, we watch him gain confidence, and finally we get to see him get tougher. Of course, we get to see the finished product with him as the vigilante, and Stephen Amell does not disappoint.<br /><br />Stephen Amell is the perfect actor to be Oliver Queen. Since he works out and does parkour in real life, he does many of his own stunts without help from wires. He looks like he could be a billionaire and he his fantastic at facial expressions.<br /><br />This show is definitely worth taking the risk. Add it to your tivo, stream it, watch it on Netflix when it comes out. It is fantastic and as the plot thickens, it just keeps getting better. Don't fail the city!
B006Y5H74W|4.0|I enjoyed the show.  It did not have the best acting but good story lines, great singers,  and set in NYC
B009M4KTEM|5.0|Robert Hunter is a GREAT writer but his singing and playing style are more than I can handle.<br />He play on two selections. For me that is the only downside of this CD.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|A little odd sometimes, but it's an oddness that makes you laugh.  The music was excellent!  George Clooney's character is pretty hilarious.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|no instructions, no \\"hints\\" just the game and you have to figure out how to play on your own!  STUPID!!!!!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Arthur Conan Doyle himself would love this re-telling of his classic character in 21st century London. Benedict Cumberbatch makes Holmes just as brilliant and bizarre as Sir Arthur's original work and I just could not stop watching. Martin Freeman makes Dr. John Watson a very human character who seems ready to strangle Holmes one minute and the next, realizes that Holmes, in spite of his arrogance and self-centered behavior, is doing good things And John Watson is too good a man to not do the right thing.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this series strongly enough...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a wonderful series and my husband and I can't wait for season 4!!  This show in additing!!
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|This is a great cd!!! The music is top notch. The vocals, musicianship are all<br />great!!! This cd is a great find if you have heard it. You will not be disappointed.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies! I've seen it hundreds of time and still like to watch it....O, and the kids love it too :D
0767812387|5.0|Good cast of characters with a nice ending and really nice dance moves enjoyable movie starting in Cuba then moving to the U.S.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Great CD, had all the old songs I love! I Love Bon Jovi! Highly recommend this CD, it's worth it!!
B00756GRUE|4.0|Seiko hit a home run with this one! Fair warning, this is a big watch. It is easily the biggest and heaviest one I own. You may want to reconsider this one if you have small wrists. The only thing that would make this better would be if it had solid end links (only reason I didn't give it 5 stars) and a sapphire crystal. Seiko really stands by their Hardlex crystals on their dive watches, even on their MM300 (SBDX001) model which is a couple thousand bucks.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great CD! I'm a fan of Kelly Clarkson and I love all of her old and new stuff on one CD...I highly recommend this CD!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|The game is so simple, it's boring. Even my six year old does not like it. I even erase it from my tablet
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I heard this was a great show so I watched all three seasons back to back! I can't wait for the next one!
B003L20IJM|5.0|My kids love this movie just as much as they loved the first one!!! Nanny McPhee is such a likeable person , hard not to like her when she whips these kids into shape::))
B00821OX98|5.0|An excellent show - good overall story combined with great individual episodes and characterization. Enjoyable for all sci fi fans.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Have only set it up and used it once so far... like the possibilities but don't like the thought of Google tracking everything you cast thru it...
B003F3FJQO|5.0|it was good<br /><br />i like how the author pulled on the third book and wicked to make it such a good book
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Should be made compulsory reading for anyone working in any organisation. Brilliantly  written and well researched. One of the most inspiring books I have ever read.
6301978587|5.0|.<br /><br />  The story was really ahead of it's time<br /><br />. I really enjoyed seeing again. I enjoyed Barbra Streisand in all of her pictur<br /><br />She is, I believe, a classy lady.
B009TO99TG|5.0|Best gift ever for a friend / girl / girlfriend, truly amazing and cheap edition even for myselft I would be happy to have it but for a gift is simply amazing!
B008JEJNDE|3.0|The quality of the Croc is great which is consistent with all crocs.  I just didn't care for the color and the sole.
B005LN5UOC|1.0|I got this in the mail yesterday and tested the mic quality to see how it sounded. It is awful. There's a hissing noise that happens the entire time, it echoes, and it sounds like you're talking into a toilet with a gas mask on. Do not listen to the 5 star reviews. They are probably idiots. Get yourself a real gaming headset like astros, tritons, or the Sony pulse (if you have a  ps3). Really disappointed.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is a great book to read.  Robert Kiyosaki has many great book on investing and life success in financial philosophy !  This is a must read for anyone that is interested in financial philosophy and becoming successful at what they love to do.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I whant monster eggs and new mobs i awsol whant the world laick the pc<br />I whant to enter riams too
B00452VF4O|5.0|Wonderful story. I love these characters and am transported to this time period with all her books. Very good book about medieval Wales.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book soooooooooooooooo much. It was one of the best books I've ever read. It was amazing!!! But I am kinda disappointed that Jace and Clary are brother and sister, cuz I wanted them to be like boyfriend and girlfriend, and u can't be bf and gf if it brother and sister!!!!. So I'm kinda hoping that later on like in the next couple of books that Jace isn't Valentine's son, and that Jace and Clary aren't brother and sister.... But besides that this book was amazing!!! Beyond words. And I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had never seen the new Dr. Who series. During several conventions , I have seen people dress like the characters and even the TARDIS. So, I have been curious since. I began to watch the first season on my Kindle Fire. And I was blown away on how good the show was. I plan to watch all the seasons going forward. Really enjoy the chemistry between all the characters, and the accents. Super creative stories.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics and interesting plot!!  I was very happy to find this game. Of course anyone can disagree with me, but at least this is my opinion.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Strayed really challenged herself, and I was in awe. I mean, pulling off your own toenails? Getting blisters? Being in pain? Something I'd nehhhhhhhver do, but I really admired her for it. My niece hiked part of the Pacific Crest Trail also, so that's what piqued my interest. Was not sorry I read it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My children had this game and we enjoyed building together as a family. It's fun building and caring for animals. Love this game.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|The more I watch Fawlty Towers, the funnier it becomes.  The situations are inprobable, the characters reactions to adversity are ridiculous,  and it all adds up to humor that is classic.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I LOVE PATRICK SWAYZE MOVIES.  THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE, I LOVE TO DANCE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKED SWAYZE .
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I have not read much of this one yet but the general impression so far is that I will like it a lot.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this is a great ga me to play with your friends or others online.i love the link to facebook option.
0679805273|5.0|This is a sweet story for old and young.  Deeper story than a child may see.  I purchased for a college grad and it was the perfect present to read aloud to her.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|How could a reader give Little Women anything but a 5 star review?  Like many little girls over the generations, I read Alcott's classic and laughed & cried along with the vibrant cast of characters.
0316201561|2.0|You don't even get past the prologue before you realize that Chris Colfer was watching Once Upon a Time on ABC and woke up the next morning thinking he had a great idea for a novel. As much as that makes me angry and annoyed, I love Once Upon a Time and enjoy the story none the less...I just wish Chris Colfer weren't getting paid for his extreme lack of imagination. Stick with acting.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is one of the best free games I've found would love to see more like it awesome!!! Maybe more superhero games or any rpg games would be great
B0074YVW1G|4.0|I am glad I have read this book. It deals with the introvert personality, and it gave me some insight into introverted people. In many ways it helps to accept myself as I am, and focus on the strengths of being an introvert, not trying to be someone else in the Sales Dale Carnegie model of the world.<br /><br />I will not say it is a practical book with things you can do, but it is great for informational purposes and more insight into being an introvert.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Book does a great job of explaining how exponentially unfolding technological developments are putting ever-increasing pressure on our Middle Class.<br /><br />Most of the solutions presented are well known and do not address:<br /><br />How the government must fundamentally change the rules of the economic playing field in order to  restore the balance between worker and stockholder interests.<br /><br />The impact on the stability of our economic/political system if we fail to take action
B003F3FJQO|3.0|All in all it was alright. There was nothing incredibly groundbreaking about this book, and there were a few over used plot devices.  The first part was boring, but it speeds up and gets really good during the middle.  Unfortunately the whole ending section was disappointing, and rather annoying, and I felt like the author kept using fake outs.  After awhile, it gets old.
B009RX8AQW|4.0|I wish I had known to get this from Best Buy. From them it contains a bonus disk with additional deleted scenes and 15 minutes on the design and fashion of Once. Very disappointed in Amazon.
B008M721MS|3.0|This worked great for a while now I'm having issues with viewing my profile. My video calls work well though I can't deny messages normally I have to use the return key to send a message.
B0081336FO|4.0|Entertaining and fun to see if the viewer can stay up with Sherlock. High energy required to stay up with the clever story line
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is so awesome for a free game you get to war and build your own base and you can get friends
067144901X|5.0|Perfect for the little kids in your life. This book is cute and has a funny storyline while teaching children animal noises. Both my four year old and one year old enjoy it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|U get 2 take your own picture or get a picture from your saved pictures  and make it looks how U want
B003YFIUW8|2.0|This could have been a great book. Instead a subject that would have made a deeply moving storyline becomes an annoying and uneven story. The five year old narrator is what kills this book for me. Jack has terrible grammar and diction (as I guess most five year do) thankfully it gets better toward the end. But his childlike view of the world and rather selfish behavior makes reading the story tedious. The only good part was **SPOILER** the escape. That part was exciting. It would have been nice if the book could have had the mom's view as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So good is illegal ....cant so playing .....one of the most funniest rush games I ever played ... they in think
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You get a lot of coins. If you are bored and play it you won't be bored any more. The zi line is really coo!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|(Review as of August 12, 2013 - hopefully they'll actually fix it soon.)<br /><br />This is probably the only time you'll see a review complaining that an app has too *few* permissions. But look at the list right here on the product listing: \\"Open network connections\\". That's it. What's missing? \\"Write to external storage\\". That's why saving doesn't work - the app doesn't have permissions to do it! That's a pretty inexcusable oversight, especially for an app whose entire reason for existence is to create new files. (Also, the fact that it silently does nothing without even displaying an error means the programmers were careless.)<br /><br />Note that I also was not able to get saving to Facebook to work, although apparently at least some others were. However, beyond simply not putting the file anywhere, saving is poor in this app. You can't just save the image you're working on; the save dialog requires you to select an image size from an (undocumented) collection like Small, Medium, Large. Presumably the app will then resize the image as it writes it out. This explains why saving takes 10 seconds instead of half a second. But there doesn't appear to be any option to just save what you're actually editing at its current size, which is a fundamental flaw.<br /><br />So while the app seems reasonably nice functionality-wise, it is in fact completely useless at the moment.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|It was worth watching once... it was a little bit too unoriginal and while the story was original, it played out in all of the expected ways. Nothing new introduced. Still, it was decent. Enjoyable.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I got to learn new things about UNO.  The music and flashy setup is a real bonus. Also, the sync option to Facebook is cool.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app so much this relly is the best alarm of a time I relly love this app so by
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I am not able to get the edited picture to save. The app looks like it is saving, but nothing. When the app is exited a prompt is displayed that your progress will be lost no matter how many times the save button is clicked.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The earlier version was good this new one sucks.<br /> They tried to improve it but failed with this new format.<br />.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I'm so glad we got the deluxe edition. We all love to watch the DVD and the kids want to learn how to play the piano better now. They make it look so fun. Love it!
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|I hope there is a sequel because the end leaves too much in doubt. Le carre continues to have a &#34;way with words&#34; but has lost some of his former zing. The ending jsut leaves one hanging which is disappointing.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Youngest grandson is now filled with &#34;the Force&#34; after getting to view these movies.  Has to have his Life Sabre with him at all times!  Great to relive history all over again, first my son, then 1st grandson (now 18) and now youngest grandson (5) all love these movies.  Looking for Parts 1, 2 and 3 now!
0738737909|5.0|Tis hard to say which of the 3 decks of modern-invent are the greatest...the Mary El, the Deviant or this gorgeous deck...this one is so over-the-top in terms of lavish finish AND in symbolism! From the gilded edges to the stunning backs of the cards...each looks like a Trump. The art is professional and magnificent. The cards are nicely sized, very snappy and crisp and in the tradition of the Smith-Waite...Lord have mercy, stop reading my review and buy this deck.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This thing is so good at guessing what you are thinking of. I can not seem to stump it. Fantastic
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ir was relly fun it reminds me of subway surfer it was really fun to play i love minions so this is the game 4 me
B00CWKLE7E|5.0|I love everything Disney and my daughter needed this and we didn't get it before it went into the vault so I was happy to purchase this used one
0385671733|5.0|This book was amazing!! it was sometimes hard to follow and the story lines did not always make sense until the end when they all connected in a way i never saw coming!! great book and I really recommend it for those who like forbidden love, adventure, a good mystery and a world of mind blowing reality in another world.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My alarm clock was broke, so this did the job. It works well and has many options to choose from.
B0000696ID|5.0|I'm so glad I got this movie.  A couple of weeks ago my nieces who are 5, 7 and 8, told me they'd never heard of this movie.  I knew I had to get it for them because every kid should see this movie at least once.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I really like the special effects and the action.  I had a little trouble toward the end, keeping the flash backs and the present action separated.  It switched back and forth a lot, you didn't know if it was present Jack or Past Jack.  Otherwise it was pretty good, I love scifi ,just keep the flash backs to a minimum.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game.is.a.must have if you are.looking to kill time. minions are awesome. great graphics easy to play. kids can easily.learn
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This weather app does it all for you. I track several locations besides my home...the beach being the main one!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Play when I get a chance.  Would suggest others to give it a try.  Makes you use your mind and patients.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a great game  to play I've played all four of the games it is a very addictive game!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is so much fun to play.it never gets old . and it's really easy to play every time
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app works great. The layout and user interface is very simple and appealing to the eye.<br />I would love to see a teeth whitening feature, though.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|The book provides thoughtful but straightforward analysis of a businesswoman's psychology and challenges both men and women to be more aware of our biases and behaviors in the office. Her observations are worth noting. While not groundbreaking, they help reassert women's issues into mainstream discourse. That has been the largest impact.
8866137634|4.0|Gimmick? Sure. Worthwhile? Yes.<br /><br />Something you HAVE to own? Well, that depends upon your habits, your desire and how much your time is worth.<br /><br />If you are a Moleskine user and make a habit of dumping your mind into Evernote, this is a very valuable tool. I have dozens of Moleskines and one Moleskine Evernote notebook. I have been an Evernote Premium member since 2011. Merging these two has been a great inspiration and very valuable tool.<br /><br />I don't see the need to own more than a few. I wouldn't switch to using these for everything, replacing my &#34;vanilla&#34; Moleskines, but I would use them for important notes, finalized ideas, priority projects.<br /><br />The various tags are fully customizeable. Now that the Evernote/Moleskine app supports iOS and Android it's very versatile. These notebooks seem even more bulletproof than the regular Moleskine variety; I just wish they made the little reporter's notebook!<br /><br />I also wish they made a few more varieties of sticker, so I can do more tweaking and fine tuning.<br /><br />Don't hesitate. If you feel a need to get these, you should probably own at least one.
B00DB31Y3U|4.0|I enjoy playing this game with the Gyro equipped, it has pretty good controls and is fun to waste some time on!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|No dislikes. This is exactly what is advertised. Very good case. Perfect fit. I like the stand up feature.  Good buy all around.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The size of this game is just crazy, It took way to long to load the app up and each level load times were bad, Even on a S3
B007THA4FI|3.0|So I finally finished this book. It took me much longer to get through than a normal read.<br /><br />This is so much a departure from Rowling's previous works it is almost equivalent to if Steven King starting to write children's books.<br /><br />While the writing is impeccable this is not an easy book to get into. Most of the characters are awful it was hard to find anyone to root for. Seemingly the most likeable character with the most redeeming qualities is the guy that dies in the beginning of the story and even his wife is upset that he seemed to care about everything else in there little town more that their family. Everyone else is so flawed; petty gossips, unhappy marriages, heroin users, abusive family members the list goes on and on. This is not a happy story.<br /><br />It is totally character driven many small stories interweaved together. All of the characters in this little town are connected by minor details throughout the book which is a feat. If you are like me and like things to be wrapped up at the end of the book this is not for you. Most of the problems brought up are never resolved completely by the end. There are some minor resolutions to a few situations but overall many strings are left hanging open.<br /><br />The character I like the best was Andrew Price the awkward teenager with acne who is infatuated with the new girl in town. He comes from a home with an abusive father and tries to take the brunt of the anger from him to protect his enabling mother and little brother. I was also pulling for Krystal, ah poor Krys. Mother addicted to heroine currently in and out of recovery she has a 3 year old brother Robbie that she is desperate to keep in her family. She is trying so hard to keep her mom straight and her dysfunctional family together. Her story is absolutely tragic. There are some bright lights at the end of the tunnel. A few characters that learned life lessons and might have become better people overall. There are also those that learned no lessons went backwards as people or remained just as awful as they had always been.<br /><br />If you like true to life type stories and character studies than this is probably something you would enjoy. I will say it isn't my cup of tea and had it been written by anyone else I probably wouldn't have made it through the first hundred pages. But Rowling is a fantastic wordsmith so I persevered.<br /><br />For writing I would give this 4.5 stars but for enjoyment of the story only 2 stars.learned no lessons went backwards as people or remained just as awful as they had always been.<br /><br />If you like true to life type stories and character studies than this is probably something you would enjoy.

B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This isn't a game you can just mindlessly play, it does require some thought and planning, I enjoyed it very much until the last couple levels.. Looking around online you can find help with how to complete the harder levels.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book was another that I couldn't pull myself a way from, but I did miss some of my favorite characters.  I know they come back in book five, but it was difficult to be without them for so long!  All in all, I would read it again and I do love the story!
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|It is a cool concept, I just couldn't get into the game. The sliding mechanics were slightly bugged on my phone and I had some movements happen that I didn't want.
B003XRELEI|3.0|By Vonnegut's own admission, Breakfast of Champions, deserves the first &#34;C&#34; grade following a pantheon of &#34;A&#34; and &#34;A+&#34; novels.  In Slaughterhouse-Five he finally tells his story of the fire bombing of Dresden the way he wants to tell it, so he's free at last, celebrating his freedom as an author by releasing all of his recurring characters.  Breakfast of Champions is an important read for the Vonnegut afficianado searching for a deeper understanding of the man and his work.  It's not the place to start in search of his unparalleled genius.
B004XZR63M|5.0|It is a great book that cleared all my misconceptions on personal finance management. A quite helpful book in designing strategic plans to get rich.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I've got this app yesterday as the free app of the day, until now I have no being able to see my finished work of editing a picture because I have no idea where this app saves the pictures, I've looked in all the folders they might have saved but I couldn't find them anywhere. THIS IS BAD, just like so many Amazon customers complained!
B00E8B1358|1.0|Don't waste your time on this movie. Channing tatum dies 10 minutes in and it is left to the rock to pick up the shattered pieces of the movie
1592332803|5.0|This is more than just a cake and cookie book. Colleen walks us through bread, pizza crust, traditional cultural breads and so much more. Last night we had whole wheat bread from scratch. Delicious!<br />My favorite thing is the tips and tricks throughout, that can really help a baking newbie. She even provides a list of alternative pan sizes in case you don't have exactly what the recipe calls for. These small touches make all the difference. Fantastic cookbook!
B007D2XSW0|2.0|So how do I find the pics after I've taken, edited, cropped, etc....<br />I think I'm saving them but then cannot find them.<br />Makes all the good features worthless.
0062255657|3.0|I was unfamiliar with Neil Gaiman. It is a fable but it feels as though author's child hood is very much in the story from his point of reference. The writing is excellent. His \\"child's\\" view is so vivid. I could not put it down.It was disturbing and black. Even though I finished it I would not recommend it. Another book by Gaiman? No.<br /><br />lee-juda@comcast.net
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER! BUY IT! ITS WORTH THE $. TRUST ME.LOTS OF BLOCKS TO CHOOSE FROM. AND THERES ANIMALS SPAWNS NOW! AND YOU CAN PLAY WITH OTHER PPL. MUST BUY! XD

B0061S0A64|5.0|The first time i saw this app was on a video from vsause and it really caught my attention but never got the opportunity to download it so logically i couldn't let this opportunity pass by when it was the free app of the day. Thanks amazon.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|I have used Texas Instrument financial calculators for years as I thought they were more straight forward to use than an HP, but this time I bought an HP and I am glad I did.  HP has simplified the data entry from the old12C.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots and lots of fun on my kindle fire. Can't get enough of it. Can spend literally hours playing it.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I had to read this book as a project and thought I would hate it because I had to do it over the summer for 8th grade but turned out to be an extremely good book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I honestly think that its a good game and all but there should be a easy way to earn coins .
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is hands down without a doubt one of the best and most addictive games I've played in recent memory. LOVE IT.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin III was the first sign that Zep took real risks and they do so again on this album. In their most stylistically diverse and forward-looking recording, the payoff is enormous. There is the fine Zeppelin of old and the closing cut brings it all back home to their beginnings. But it's when they're exploring art-rock and cutting their teeth into contemporary black rhythms that this really takes off. &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34;, with Jimmy Page's lightning-quick guitar notes and Bonzo's fierce drumming, achieves a raving art-rock sound sans any keyboards. It kicks some serious butt! Not even Yes could claim the same. The band undertakes James Brown funk on &#34;The Crunge&#34; and the reggae groove on &#34;D'Yer Maker&#34;. You best believe they got their groove on. Robert Plant knows when to let loose and when to exercise restraint. And how nice to find that John Paul Jones plays more of a creative force. He raises the synthesizer and mellotron to the state of high art while integrating them with Zep's sound. Their best, I think.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device considering it was only $35 dollars. Only draw back is lack of apps supported currently, however in the near future more apps will be available. Overall it's easy to use, set up and haven't had an issue yet. Streams Netflix and play movies without lag or shuttering. I would recommend this device to anybody. My girlfriend even wants one now, and she never likes to use new technology.
B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top has been playing together for 30 years the only other band that has remained together for that long is the Rolling Stones at 50 years.If you have never heard ZZ Top, by this album, ZZ Top's Greatest Hits and go to &#34;Cheap Sunglasses&#34;!  What more can I say? Wolf 843
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun and it was very descriptive. Although it wouldn't be fair to those of you reading this review unless I told you all of my thoughts on this book. It claims to be a book but my idea of a book is much longer than this. It seemed to be more of a longer short story. Something one can read in a couple of hours waiting for the sun to come out on a rainy afternoon. I also have been left very confused. Like I said it was a fun book to read, but I'm still not sure what the book was really about and what age group it is meant for. I almost fill like its something to share with your children. Even then I'm not sure they wouldn't finish also questioning the point. In closing I would just like to say read this without high expectations, but do read it to have a little fun!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The guitar rifs from Tony, the bass rifs from Geezer...just the usual best you can ask for. And Ozzy sounding sober...THAT'S unusual and very welcomed. The whole album has deep meanings throughout, really makes you think. Overall, its one of my favorite albums because of the consistent quality across all tracks
1416955070|1.0|Let me be very clear:  whenever I buy a book, I *want* to love it.  I will ignore almost any weaknesses in a story if the story itself is good enough.  A couple of plot holes, a ridiculous romance, irritatingly similar characters - these things register, but are (for me) easily overlooked.<br /><br />I could not make it halfway through this book before I just gave it (and the other Cassandra Clare book I was reading alongside it) to someone else.  Apart from these, there has only been one other book in my entire reading career that I couldn't finish.<br /><br />This book was not smart, it was not funny, and failed absolutely to capture any kind of atmosphere (which is what matters the most to me).  The characters were boring and immature and *so* predictable.  To put it in perspective, let me say this:<br /><br />To my slight shame, I've read all the Twilight series.  They weren't my favorite - and I definitely did not enjoy Bella as a heroine - but for all Stephanie Meyers' authorial shortcomings, she did a very good job with creating and maintaining a tone.  The environment, Bella's voice, character interactions:  they all painted a distinct picture, and the series had a definite *feel* to it.  No matter how good or bad the story was (and let's be honest...it was pretty terrible), when you started reading it, it removed you from your surroundings because the atmosphere was solid.  And when a book does that well, how they do it is indescribable; you can't pinpoint any one thing that makes it that way, because *everything* is that way, and it is that way seemingly effortlessly.<br /><br />But this book was trying way, way, way too hard to succeed at anything.  When you're relying on something like four or five long, dark similes and/or metaphors per page, while the main characters are supposed to be crisp and edgy - the whole thing comes off as contrived and unnatural.<br /><br />What I'm saying is that while it's true that I do read snotty intellectual books, I also have no problem reading and enjoying absolute trash - and this book was so forced and not thought out, even I couldn't enjoy it.  Though it is worth noting that if someone made a movie out of this, I'd totally go see it because I know the kind of movie it would be, and it would be loads of fun to watch.  Just not to read.
B005HED11Y|4.0|I was 6 when this series first started and didn't understand it all.  Now I'm middle aged, and I see deeper meaning in these stories.  It's a lot of fun.
B0079J28NW|5.0|A must for any Beatles fanatic. Corny subject matter, but entertaining. The Beatles, the original music video makers. You got to love it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|such a very real story. you get emotionally attached to the characters and want the best possible outcome that would be possible.
B008RTE09S|5.0|Great for and Beatles fan. Very cheasy topic matter but great music. Beatles, the original music video makers. Got to love it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|what might be a very sad story about the war, this is warm and loving. You fall in love the characters and hopeit never ends, because you want to follow them forever.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|Samsung Note 10.1, the only way to play is holding my tablet at my waist, can two-finger change the magnification but not enough to see the whole play board at the same time. The graphics are great, play is smooth... Beyond level 3, requires more time than I have to master balancing turning corners without walls. Needs an easy mode to just solve the puzzles without having to balance act too. This is the best quality 3D ball maze I've seen, if you love this type of game, worth .99
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't love all things British, but this series had me captivated. I loved that they use common sense and do not overdramatize. No unnecessary fluff, if you know what's mean, in between as scenes as a filler. Had me on edge without dropping me off. Can't wait for the next season.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|It did have some funny parts, but overall it was boring and tough to watch.  I have watched tough goood movies, but this was just tough because it was boring.  Kind of like getting your teeth drilled on with out novacaine.  It is dooable, but why?
B00DW39B2K|3.0|If it weren't for Travolta and De Niro, two outstanding actors, I would have given this a 2. But both these guys are favorites of mine and played their roles well as usual, but the storyline didn't do a whole lot for me.
B004S5C43E|4.0|As usual Jeffrey Archers magic has worked again. Strong main character, I became involved in the story from the very first page. Amazing read, can't wait for the next one.<br />I bought this book from Amazon.  Ricky Hutchinson
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Drama, characters, plot, good acting, etc. Excellent movie. Would have given it a five if it had a tad more depth.
B001608R5I|5.0|This album is a classic, and I consider it one of my best vinyl purchases. Really, consider buying this album - it's worth it.
B00E1LT41K|4.0|I fell in love with this series the first episode, I think it was very well written I am going to buy the series.<br /> the above reviews tell you the story, so I wont bore you with more.<br />  I fell in love with King Edwards in the beginning.
B004NS710C|4.0|We liked this movie enough to add it to our collection.  With all the streaming options and various movie options on tv a movie has to be &#34;watch it over and over&#34; quality for us to purchase a disc - this is a great action flick.  As with all our purchases from amazon the package arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B0058SNJCA|5.0|Needed something decent for being outside w/ my dogs in wet weather. These are great, look nicer than the traditional crocks and are quite comfy. Would definitely buy again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game very much. It is addicting. Don't play it while you drive though. That would be highly unintelligent.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Such a witty and clever show. Plus got to watch it for free on my prime account! Couldn't beat that!
B001ANYDAO|2.0|Have not finished to book.  I just can't seem to get into the concepts.  I will keep trying to get motivated to turn the pages.  I guess it was not what I expected.  Others seem to love it and recommended it to me.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I really just love this movie it's one of my favorite, history, plot, photograph, characters ending, everything almost perfectly performs, and be able to watch in high definition all these characteristics it's priceless.
0385349831|5.0|First found this book in the library. After I read it I ordered 7 more copies to give to my kids
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a amazing game and a great way to pass time and I think everyone should get it because it's totally worth it!!!!!
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|This was a really good movie. The ending was a bit disappointing, but it definitely kept me interested through the entire movie.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Lots of action and some times the Bat gets his butt kicked but generally true to the Batman mystique.  Good animation and great toys...
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|i was thankful that it wasn't scary.  i think it could have been better, but it had a sweet story.
B00CDCIQX6|4.0|I liked this movie but I know that I will have to watch it a few more times to get every time line straight in my mind.  This movie moves between time lines very quickly and seemingly at random which makes it hard to keep up with this complex story.  Believe me I will be on MY toes the next time I view this.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Finally got to the only thing I knew about H VIII.  I've never watched a Showtime series...so far...1 for 1
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I like SiFi movies and have watched all that I can along with reading a few thousand SiFi books.  Good Drama and lots of action.  Good for guys and chicks too.  Enjoy...
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I really liked this app at first....good graphics and was pretty fun to add plants and things to your reef to try to attract friends and rare fish. But, eventually everything you were asked to do (homework, grow certain plants, open chests) all required pearls. The only way to attract a rare fish, which produces pearls was to grow an extraordinary rare plant, which took at least 10 pearls to grow. The pearls take way too long to accumulate, and 2 different times I had 7 pearls, was almost ready to harvest some from my rare fish to make 10 so that I could buy another rare plant, and suddenly the pearls in my stash were gone!  So frustrating!!  Also, when the game opened you were given certain items and shown what you would earn the next day. Several times the next day showed that I would earn pearls....but then suddenly the next day it changed and I earned more sand dollars. Like I said, game was pretty fun for a while, but it got old quick just waiting and waiting and waiting for pearls that were then taken away from me.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Action in this movie hardly slows down.  Moves from one action scene to another with hardly any hesitation.  Ladies, buy this for your guy, He'll love it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My grandkids love this app!!  At the end of a long day when they have had their baths and are trying to get settled in for bed, this definitely comes in handy.  This app allows my grandaughter to mix & match up to 3-4 sounds to create a unique melody.  It helps the kids drift off to sleep in no time at all.  Thanks for making such a great app!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Totally enthralling. But admittedly, I love historical fiction. Follett has done another wonderful job. Can't wait for book three now.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Right now it's questionable because this app is a little confusing.  For some reason it doens't allow me to do a simple search like I normaly would using the regualr Google search engine online.  I hope to get it all figured out soon.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I was happy to receive my order quick and in good condition. I love this show and look forward to buying each season to complete my set. Sad that there won't be any future seasons of Spartacus.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love Downton Abbey because it delves deeply in to each character and is a great period piece. I think it does a a great job at showcasing actual acting without just spending millions on CGi and not really letting actors act. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different than the usual fare on TV this is it.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Received in great condition and in timely manner. I was never one to order online, but have enjoyed the convenience. I miss that there won't be anymore seasons of Spartacus.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is a good book but it's so long but im all about my studying for school so # straight A student
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very happy with the app and it allows me to enjoy the books my Nook doesn't support. I can read them all my Android devices.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|An awesome app with flawless UI and it can find players very quickly whether your internet connection is good or not. The only flaw is not being able to play games without using the token-like objects, so when you run out you must purchase more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is addicting! It's got great features and the characters are adorable! I love the different areas to play in and the ability to set the game difficulty to my own age.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My children love this me move. Age appropriate with a reasonable rental price. Funny move for the whole family to watch !!!!
6304711905|5.0|This movie have an all star cast that includes BillyBob Thorton, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer!  When I was in the service, this was our mascot movie we watched it so much that we all memorized every line in it and it never got old!  Recommend this movie to anyone!!!  Enjoy!
B004I1K2NW|5.0|About 90 minutes into this film I was wondering why it was rated R. There are some gruesome and intense moments in the first 90 minutes but hardly anything approaching a R rating. Well, that last 30 minutes is why. It is shockingly intense and I found myself really disturbed. I would never expect that from either Zemeckis or Fox. They both have had a reputation of making mostly family friendly type films. Especially Fox. And maybe that is why this film was not a huge hit. Which is why DVDs and blu rays are so much fun. We can discover movies that we missed the first time. This film should have been a big hit. It is that good.<br /><br />This blu ray is amazing. It has the original version and the director's cut. It has commentary by Peter Jackson. It has a nearly FOUR HOUR documentary on the making of this film. What more could anyone ask? The picture is gorgeous and so is the sound.<br /><br />As for the film? It starts out with a decidedly comedic feel and maintains that til about halfway through. Then it gets dark. And then darker. And then really dark. Again, it is rated R for a reason. And it is not sex or language. The final half hour in the hospital is just masterfully done.<br /><br />I always enjoy a good scary movie but one that is also interesting. The Frighteners delivers on both counts.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is awesome but in order to by rarity we would need to use the coins not the gems.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Big hit with the family.  Animation is cool and kept their attention.  Transformers are facinating.  No need to get deep in the story, purpose is to be cutting edge coolness.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's an awesome game if you love animals and if you want to be a vet then you can play and help the animals and have fun at the same time. Have fun with the game.  :-) B P
B0052AC8C6|2.0|boring, did not finish because it was boring.  am only writing to finish up my required number of boring words.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|It's cable. It works. It's sturdy. It's cheap. No messy packaging involved. What more could you ask for in a cable?
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is the top of the essentials list for movie lovers. Can't count how many times I have watched it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nice way to wake up everyday.  Features are easy to use, and gradual music is a great way to get the day started.  Overall a great utility for my Kindle Fire HD.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game so much I could play it all day.<br /><br />there's fun animals. there's everything fun I just<br />love this game ghats all I have to say
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Worth every penny - hours of engrossing maze puzzles from easy to mind-bending, without ever being overly frustrating. Lots of levels with different approaches keep it fresh and interesting beginning to end. Highly recommended.
B00BIPORC8|5.0|This is a great TV series with plenty of surprises. Can't believe I missed this series entirely until I viewed it on Amazon Prime. Each season gets better than the next.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I don't listen to country music.<br />I remember Darius from the Blowfish and liked his song \\"I only wanna be with you.\\"<br /><br />I brought this CD just to see what a black man singing country music sounds like and I am blown away.<br /><br />Ever song is a hit and each tells a story with depth and meaning.<br /><br />I can't say which song is best I love them all.<br />Wagon wheel puts me in a good mood driving to work.<br />Radio makes me smile.<br />I was driving to work one early morning and cried like a baby the first time I heard Shine and still get misty eyes when I hear it. It is such a beautiful story and I feel a true one.<br /><br />My favorite is Lie to me.<br />This brother can sing and I count myself a true believer!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. It reminds me of playing the game when I was younger.  The tokens go way too quick
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Keeps you deep into thought about the who's why's and where's in the story. A great read and one I'm glad to have on my devices.
B00E193TM2|5.0|I love this new album, I cant say enough about it! Literally every song is amazing, cant wait for vol. 2 to come out!
B0019CB5T8|5.0|a great movie to watch if you want to know the truth about what happened to her and the pastor.
0385535147|5.0|As usual, hard to put it down.  Stayed up late to finish.  Thanks for NOT using all the vulgar language like so many Authors are doing nowadays.  I'll keep reading your books!
0451232852|5.0|I did not know Ken Follett's books well when I read this.  All I knew is that they were typically long and I wasn't interested in committing a summer to reading one of them.  This book was so worth it however.  If you enjoy politics you will probably enjoy this book.  If you don't, then just move on now.<br /><br />The way he weaves historical politics into believable fictional characters is magical.  This is one of my favorite books of all time and will almost certainly go back and re-read it at some point.  Right now am working my way through some of his other historical pieces.  Follett has created a story where every character is both lovable and loathable for many reasons but ultimately believable.  He does not shy away from either joy or tragedy.  Many of the historical events of the last century we have learned about from textbooks which simplify events down to small sentences or paragraphs.  What we miss are the intricacies that allowed those events and those life choices to happen.  Truly fascinating stuff.<br /><br />Thank you Ken for helping me understand our history better.
B007IQX9ZW|4.0|It is an indie film and it can be a little slow at times, but the concept and story are interesting and it is relatively realistic as the ending is unexpected but smart.  I love Charlize Theron and I think she is great in this film.  Don't expect a laugh a minute, action, adventure, other big name actors or anything completely exciting.  It is a look into the life of a  beautiful woman who appears to have it all, but there is a sad lonely truth lying beneath.
0525952926|3.0|First of all I absolutely LOVED Fall of Giants.  This 2nd book was a let down for me.  I'm not sure I can put my finger on why I am dissappointed however.  Certainly part of it was that the politics during that historical period are a less facinating (at least to me who had a better background in this period).  I think I can also say that this book seemed too contrived as well as Follett worked so hard to make just a couple people accidentally interact with each other in a world of millions of people over many generations.  Finally, this book is looooooooooooooong.  That's not a negative but it certainly dragged in spots.<br /><br />So to summarize:  I certainly do not regret reading it.  In fact, I will be reading the 3rd book as well when it comes out.  I just didn't love it as much as the first book.  If you have not read that one and enjoy politics, then you are doing yourself an disservice.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have gone through 3 seasons in about a month.  The acting is superb.  It seems to be realistic to the times they are depicting.<br />I highly recommend this show if you like exceptional acting and the joy of hearing the English language.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Now the City Watch books and along the same lines those that involve Samuel Vimes tend to explore the various races of the Discworld in line with cultural bias in the city and general themes related to discrimination versus tolerance. And this book followed that pattern, the race in question now being goblins, who are largely treated as vermin within the confines of the Disc.<br /><br />As is the nature of Discworld novels these days, this one was firmly rooted in the overall continuity of the larger universe. While it is not absolutely required for one to have read all the prior novels to understand what happens here, the experience is made all the richer if you have. In this case, we have a lot of strong connections to the events that were depicted in Thud! and the side bonus of connecting to any stories involving Vimes' son (including Where's My Cow?)<br /><br />The book is, well, a masterpiece in itself. Once again Pratchett demonstrates just how skilled a wordsmith he is as the story operates on several levels in the same way that the title has multiple meanings. There are the direct events actually depicted on the page and yet there are also the messages and lessons to be learned that Pratchett sneaks into things. You don't immediately catch what he's hinting at but once you do it's too late - you've learned something new about our own crazy little world.<br /><br />From a character perspective, it's hard to go wrong with Vimes. But it was also nice to see a lot more of Sybil as she was clearly in her element back in her home province (or whatever). And I also appreciated how Wilikins has become far more than just the butler in the background. His peculiar background and unique talents came in particularly helpful use over the course of the book.<br /><br />Snuff is yet another witty, intelligent and brilliant book from Terry Pratchett. It has a lot for long-term Vimes fans and still even more for relatively newcomers to the overall series.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Not great but good.  Too invested in the series to stop reading them now.  Needs to get back to some old plots like Relic.
B00C1040TO|1.0|I learned about this from my cello teacher and it was really cool but when I downloaded it on my kindle fire it didn't work at all.
0307887960|5.0|this diet makes a lot of sense.  it works just like he says it will.  plus the lack of choices makes it easy to follow.  long term its just wait and see
B00992CF6W|5.0|when I got this game it was awesome and you can make what ever you want to build get this game now
B007BVMVDU|5.0|love the movies very true to the books and the period filming is phenomenal with costuming and backgrounds just excellent
B00A2GQT5C|5.0|I mean, it is Whitney Houston!  Before she completely fell apart, this was amazing and truly in her prime!  This album takes a lot of her best work a puts in all in one awesome location!
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I am an American but the English have by far out done the Americans when it comes to mysteries, dramas and comedies. I buy more movies created by the English than any other country. The series Dalton Abbey has by far exceeded my expectations and I am hooked; I can barely wait for the season 4. I was just sick about the demise of Matthew and the show may suffer from his absence. If there is anyone out there who loves mysteries I would highly recommend Midsummer Murder Mysteries. Truthfully speaking I have enjoyed nearly all the English mysteries and have them in my library.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|This guy must be an Alchemist, since he keeps making GOLD!!!  This is one of the few albums that I love more than 1/2 the song in it.  I especially enjoy the one from Usher.  I do find it funny how many times he says \\"Mr WorldWide!\\" or goes \\"Wooooooo!!\\"  I bet if you had a drinking game using his album and taking a shot when you heard those two phrases, you would be dead quickly.
B007MAETA8|4.0|such as If I Ever Get Around, Whiskey, and Queen of California. Just the fact he made this after recovering from the throat issues is amazing. Seeing JM next week in Woodstock and looking forward to it very much.
B0099G3I96|2.0|Yea, this album has one good song on here and the rest just plain suck.  I wonder if they learned anything from their previous albums.  This feels like when Disney take a movie from long ago and makes a sequel just to scrape some cash in at the expense of a classic.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Pretty good movie. Crazy action but no where as good as the first one. The first had everything from city's being destroyed, crazy planes, underwater fortress. This movie had some cool planes and a tank. That was about it. )-: Expected more.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|This movie is truly amazing.  Liam is fantastic, but this one blows my mind.  Yea, it is in black-and-white, but it helps with the atmosphere so well.  This is a movie I would highly recommend for anyone that even has a passing interest in this subject.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Coming from a life long sci fi fan I can tell you this is exactly what I wanted and the sci fi community needed. I like how it had a feel from several other movies that seemed to be an influence on this film including: Independence Day, the 6th Day and even a little of Disney's Wall-E. Great movie and it's safe for little ones with just mild violence and one &#34;F&#34; bomb at the end.
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|Selena Gomez has been doing great since she broke from TV and is rocking the music scene!  Although I think she is awesome, I do feel that there are number of tracks on this album that feel like they are filler.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|Great movie very suspenseful. Noomi rapace is great in this movie. Would recommend this to anyone who likes suspenseful movies.
0062278096|4.0|We discovered &#34;Sherlock&#34; quite recently and can't wait for Season 3 to air.  This companion book is beautifully produced and full of interesting pieces about the new show-plots, stars, background-and the canonical texts and previous interpretations.  Aside from the many luscious pictures of current It-boy Benedict Cumberbatch, the book tells the very tragic story of my other favorite Sherlock portrayer, Jeremy Brett, and has lots of material on the new show's references to the original stories .
B008TRUDAS|5.0|AMAZING book! Loved every bit of it! I need to find me a Will! He is an amazing guy. LOVE LOVE LOVE
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome it just keeps going instead of being stagnant lime other games. we keep going to new cities with daily challenges and missions it never gets boring
B004Q3SGNK|4.0|Very impressive. Tastefully done. Superb acting by James Franco. You may think this is a waste of time but just watch it.
B002PLALCO|5.0|Did not know how talented she really is! Powerful backing band - VERY entertaining!!! HAVE to see her live now!!!
B0091XEW9M|3.0|I like movies with Natalie Portman but this simply was not my genre. My wife loved it though. To each his own I guess.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app!  This makes EBay so easy and accessible.  I use it exclusively now because it's just so easy.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Not as cohesive as i'd like it to be, but well worth watching.  Some  main characters not as likable as I am used to
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Great writing, good plots, excellent characters, more than beach reading...<br />Right up there with Lehane, Burke, Mosley and Rankin<br />You can feel the grime
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I got the new version and I love it because it tells me the weather 24/7 whoever made this app did a good job
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This is one of the best mini-series ever! Especially if you like storylines about journalism. I have watched it many times now and each time I love something new about.
B009WUBERW|5.0|it was filled with lots of action. Fun & exciting to watch graphgics was good. Enjoyed the humor, a lot of it referred to their other movies which I seen them all. I would certainly watch this movie again.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I can't even begin to explain why this movie was even made. The acting of even established well reviewed and normally liked stars is deplorable. I'm very disappointed that I wasted a Saturday afternoon watching this movie.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is a fantastic movie. It has everything you want in a movie. Comedy, action, romance, drama. While Disney did a bad job advertising for the movie it is great. I didn't know what I was getting into when I saw it for the first time, but I found my self totally focused for the whole movie. This isn't a movie you'll fall asleep watching. The 3d feature is awesome too. Works perfectly on my Panasonic vierrra. Well worth the purchase, I only hope some day Disney will make a sequel.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I was very pleased with the movie adaptation of this great musical I had seen in the theater three times.
031620157X|5.0|Loved the twists and turns in this fairy tale adventure and how it ties in familiar fairy tales and brings them to life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game but very additive.  one you start it is very hard to stop. I have to make sure I have alot of time to keep playing. Just can't put it down
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Purchased this for my Minecraft obsessed son and he loves it.  While he is just 7 years old, he was able to follow the directions and build it in a reasonable amount of time.  I can already see the wheels spinning in his head trying to figure out how he can build more with his regular Legos.  He also wanted to know when the next set was going to come out...He would have really loved it if the pieces came with the patterns printed so it looked more like the game, but regardless he loves it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|These two folks clearly deserved each other - kept you guessing quite awhile as the story unfolded. Cleverly written novel
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This case has held up really well and provided great protection for my phone at a great price.  Has definitely met my expectations.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Had an issue with a new install giving me weird red squares and the developer answered immediately and rectified the situation for me, no better customer service can be had,  highly recommended.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett surpasses all other authors of trilogies!!!  His research of  history is so thorough and well-written, that you can almost relive the past.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love how the story lines are coming together. I can hardly wait for the new season!  It can't get here soon enough.
B00006F83Y|4.0|I bought this album because I love &#34;No One Knows,&#34; &#34;Go With the Flow,&#34; and &#34;Hanging Tree&#34; so I wasn't sure what to expect from the rest of the album. Some songs such as &#34;Another Love Song&#34; I really enjoyed; however, I find myself continually skipping songs from this album every time they play on my ipod because I find them kind of boring, for my favorite type of music is generally energetic and/or angry sounding, so I just didn't think it fit my taste particularly well. Overall, it's a 'kay album...
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this app! It lets me do so many different things to my pics. I strongly recommend downloading it. :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've played many applications many I have deleted because without me spending money I could not get anywhere.  This is not the case with Ice Age.  I can get acorns simply from clearing snow. It was nice to see the creators have an option for those that don't have money to spend in game.  Mini games and trailers are also included.  Play kung fu scrat!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fast-paced game that keeps me on my toes.  Easy to understand and fun to play.  Gets my heart rate going as I try to avoid danger.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book, and if you are available to see my purchases, I have bought at least 5 copies for my friends.  The book this friend went to liked it so much, he sat down in one day and read the whole book, cover to cover.  He said he loved it and is putting the knowledge to work!  I originally opened Amazon, not to go through my order list to make comments to the sellers, but to order another book of the SECRET for another friend of mine.  Amazing book and all the used copies are in incredible condition!!!  He received his in a very short period of time, and on a day he was needing a lift, so the delivery made it to him on the perfect day!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a little stressful, because you have to really pay attention to avoid all the dangers.  However, the characters are so cute and their giggles so contagious that I find myself smiling and giggling with them.  No matter your age, you will have fun with this game.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The button to change profiles is easily accessible, and there are 4 lights on the top of the mouse, left of the left mouse button, signifying which profile is currently active. It's all so customize-able it's crazy! One button can even simulate pressing two buttons at once. You can choose a polling rate from 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, and 1000Hz. I was told I'd receive. I think that about covers the potential issues with mouse.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is the type of game where you can be relaxed while playing.  It's fun to complete the different challenges and watch the disasters hit the town.  The one thing that would make it better, is if some of the items in the game did not cost real money.  I won't spend real money on it, so will not be able to take full advantage of all the fun.  This one is fun for all ages.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|The picture quality was good.  I was expecting the movie to lag compared to other sites.  Will definitely watch the other free movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The ease of switching between different versions makes it nice to compare passages while in Sunday school or the church service.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Loved when I was 10 love it now so endearing and probably has some things adults and kids can still relate to<br />In these<br />Times
0061900656|5.0|This is by far the favorite book for my 2yo about being a big brother. The writing AND the pictures are good in this book. It goes over things a little one can understand like how a baby is too little for this or that or a baby likes this or that. Unlike other books, it does a relatively good job of explaining things like why a baby cries and that being a &#34;BIG&#34; brother has its advantages too. It also lets the older sibling know he is special. In my opinion, that covers enough to make me happy and makes sense to my little one too. How can you beat that? There is nothing about breastfeeding in this book but that does not mean one who breastfeeds (i.e. me) should overlook it. It refers to milk, shows a bottle but not where it comes from so it doesn't promote either but simply relays information that your child can understand IMO.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Daniel SIlva was recently interviewed (summer 2013) on the Today show about his new book, &#34;The English Girl: A Novel.&#34;  He was asked for his summer reading list. He said that Flynn was a friend who had recently died and that his spy craft books were great. Enough said. I ordered the book and agree with Silva. Although much of the terrain, weapons and intelligence community information is familiar territory for those who enjoy this genre, the emphasis on bad relations between the intelligence community, the press and politicians hits so close to current events as to be uncomfortable.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|There are to many characters whose stories are not ended. Whether they are junk inside the main story or it would be nice to connect them to it.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I loved the background features, the additions to the story with the son, and the changes to the whole film.  Definitely worth the money, and you'll enjoy this version much more than the theatrical release.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a very good book. Cancer teens in love. There's quite a lot of description of daily cancer routine, how patients and their families live with it every day. It's a sad book but that's to be expected.<br /><br />It would be a great book to read for teens (the main characters are 16 and 17 years old) but I really enjoyed it as an adult (who doesn't usually read YA books)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Some movies are predictable this isn't.  I really enjoyed it even though I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan (I think he's gone a little off the deep end with that Scientology).
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Enjoying single player, good learning for building your own  decks. Sealed decks and challenges are fun as well.  Worth the purchase.
B0083Z614S|5.0|When I was a book hungry kid back in the late 50s and early 60s, I found The Secret Garden in the school's library.  Though I was a boy there was something about this book that captured my imagination (some say it's a &#34;girls&#34; story.). Finding it at Amazon for Kindle iPad as a free book I downloaded it.  It was like seeing an old friend again.  Such a simple and uplifting story engagingly told, with wonder, mystery, and a positive and satisfying conclusion.  I can't wait to find more &#34; old friends.&#34;<br /><br />I love my iPad even more now that I can read good books, old and new.<br />GS
B003ELMR9E|4.0|Certainly enough has been said regarding the storyline summary, acting and other insightful opinions so I will forego that and focus solely upon the transfer to blu ray.<br /><br />VIDEO...<br />  You will be hard pressed to find a cleaner transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray than you will find with Insomnia.  While I do not believe it has been remastered, they obviously took it from a very clean and perfect first master.  You will find no aliasing, artifacts, banding or stair stepping anywhere in this film.  The color grading is perfect with its earthy tones and slightly crushed blacks which all contribute to the exhausted and morally confused Al Pacino's character.  There are many dark scenes yet details are readily apparent.  The Mbps rate appeared to average in the low to mid twenties and that is certainly good enough for this intriguing and often overlooked film.  The fog during many scenes does not come across as faked CGI and really draws the viewer into the claustrophobia and lost atmosphere.<br /><br />AUDIO...<br />  The DTS HD MA 5.1 is a lossless audio codec that is superior to any lossy codec that you find on Standard Def DVDs.  The dialogue is always transparent with clear, crisp pronunciation and properly balanced volume with the sound-score.  There is some nice discreet channeling to the front surrounds but it is used sparingly as this is a dialogue driven film but there are a few scenes where the front and rear surrounds, as well as the LFE channel, are brought in to create a nice atmospheric ambience.  The surrounds are primarily used for ambience and little use for the LFE channel is clearly by design.  The audio is as good as it can be expected to be for a film of this type.<br /><br />EXTRAS..One deleted scene whose audio level, despite being DD 2.0 was far too low in volume.  I had to really push it up.  The scene itself wasn't much so I can see why they cut it.  Many other extras in the form of interviews and dialogues with Al Pacino, the director and several others.  I can't say I have watched them all but the ones I did watch were worthy.<br /><br />All in all, this is about the best you are going to get for Insomnia and that's not bad.  A very well produced Blu Ray.<br />Every one of my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray and I do hope that this short review had been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.  If so, I hope my other reviews will be of help as well.<br />Thanks for reading.ector and several others.

0812982622|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Took me to a world that is both fasinating and frightening. Did an outstanding job a depicting authentic characters in country few of us know much about. Great ride!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app has never begged me for a review. I keep the two soundtracks on, Crickets 1 and Crickets 2, constantly, going on now for months, at about 3/8 volume, night and day. Most people never seem to notice. I have not heard a single comment or inquiry. Spouse cannot hear them.  Yet I am always in tune with the crickets....one track a hot sunny day in the field...the other track a cool dark night, superimposed.  The result is, I am calmed and soothed, and I can locate the Kindle. This review is my sincere thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great escape challenge. Nothing too hard or too simple. Only a few levels though, they need to make more. Nice graphics
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|You should definatly watch this. It was better then I expected, good plot and it flows through the whole movie to keep you hooked. It's going in my collection
B005ZUR724|5.0|Best game ever<br />You should buy this game they worked hard to make it so buy it<br />Have fun playing this awesome game
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|It was surprisingly good, could tell they through it together in a hurry, or just messed up in editing, either way it's worth it to watch it, Defiantly
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best Solitaire games to play. The app makes it easy to play without having to make too many hand movements to move the cards around. Simply tap the cards, and the game knows where you intend to place it. I love the auto-complete  at the end of the game. Be careful, this game is addictive!
B00CZAYNOC|2.0|The first album was amazing. Since then, there has been a slow decline with the band's music and lyrics. They are a band, right? The word &#34;I&#34; is used countless times on this album, just like on American Capitalist. It's too much. If you like hard rock/thrash metal, and never listened to Five Finger Death Punch before, I'd suggest listening to their first album, The way of the fist, then go from there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think a lot of people will like this game!!!! You have to be creative and cautious on how you spend your money though. So be careful.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I thought the movie was hilarious; I loved the minions. I kind of wanted to adopt the three little girls. It was a great movie.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting and informative view on the capture/death of Osama Bin Laden. Very well planned and executed. HEROES all of them that were on the mission.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to set and turn off. It's not a cadillac but the price is right.
B002XMBVEM|5.0|Love Enya. I have most of her albums. Very relaxing and soot.hing music to listen. Great tension reliever and enjoyable
B001UTW7QU|3.0|Interesting show.  I only watched 2 episodes but as someone with an engineering background, there were too many things that were stretches of the imagination and just not plausible.  It's as if the writers built the story and then had to quickly connect the dots to wrap it together.  And I realize it is science fiction, but since this show is set in modern day America, I automatically expect it to follow the rules of physics and other sciences.  So when it doesn't, I move on to something else.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have used Yahoo since 1998 and still enjoy the improvements they make. So as they I grow with them!
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The portrayal of Khan's Autism is both accurate and endearing.  It is an amazing story that looks into ignorance and intolerance versus forgiveness, selflessness and kindness.  Part of the story portrays how innocent Muslims were affected by 911- fear, anger, prejudice, but also meekness and forgiveness.<br />There are some political views lightly expressed (the producers favored Obama over Bush), but it really doesn't detract from the overarching theme of compassion and seeking to understand, and doing what you know is right regardless of what anyone else thinks or does.  And the power of influence for good that one man can have.<br /><br />Watch it.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I love this show and watched both seasons twice in the last couple of years. I highly recommend this show.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is one of the best apps I have ever used. My sister was playing it on her opacity one day, and I decided to get it on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Everything was great. My sister and I were friends in it, and we made lots of gems and money by visiting and all. I had three islands and some rare dragons without using any real money but then came a serious problem.<br /><br />I wanted new apps on my Kindle, but it turns out DragonVale uses way too much memory for me to download one small measly app. I deleted three apps, bit there was still no space. Once I deleted DragonVale, boy, there was a huge chunk of space left.
B004S3MB2U|1.0|Worked great at home with a WiFi connection, but when I was out with no connection, discovered the app doesn't work.  For it to function, you must have an internet connection.  Ridicolous requirement for a calculator app.  Uninstalling.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|perfect for relieving stress and rewarding gameplay and storyline.reminiscent of the Baldurs Gate series for PC.this game is exactly what I was looking for.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app used to be simple and easy to use.  Now it's complicated and filled with adds and social features I don't use.  I miss being able to see how the weather would proofread throughout the day, and not this general forecast.  I do not like this new update not one bit.
B005PR422K|5.0|This has been one of the single most influential books in the startup sector; now applicable to big business too..
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|There isn't much more I can say about the Tenth Doctor's era on Doctor Who. The DVD set is great, no complaints here. Once again, I absolutely loved this season and the finale broke my stupid heart. As much as I've liked all of the companions in the first seven series, Donna may be my favorite (so far). Of course there are a few more episodes with the Tenth Doctor but this is the final full series so it was a bittersweet moment when my DVD arrived. Doctor Who series 4 is just as great as the previous seasons and I believe these DVDs are worth every cent, but I always buy them on sale :) I'm glad these sets are available so the fans will be able to enjoy Doctor Who for years to come.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|If I told you everything Halfbrick did right with this game, this review would literally go on forever. Just trust me when I say that this game is a must-play, and there's no reason not to play it.
B001DE29SS|5.0|I loved Chaplin and Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of this talented comedian. Mr. Downey truly should of received the Oscar for this performance!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I think that this is one of the best apps I have!!!! The only think I would have to criticize about it (and I don't know if it with only my kindle) but it goes Really slow when I try to share it on Facebook!!!! Love this app otherwise!!!THANKS&lt;3
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Good science fiction movie reminiscent of the Matrix. However there is a lingering feel that this was based on book with more complexity and story than is offered in movie format.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Good, but needs more features, needs to be able to view more long term weather days and be  able to tell the current weather better.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Love this movie, it starts out slow but with a obvious note to something more.  Going on with the movie you learn the twisted story line that finishes with a twist.  Its a must have Tom Cruise and You got to love Morgan Freeman (awesome actor).
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|was looking for a game similar to myst. this is not myst. fun none the less reminds me of my old highlights magazines with a unique twist of loot and atmosphere.
B000VSAEYI|3.0|I did my research. I  really did. I needed a splash pad for my daughters' 1st birthday. I even bought a more expensive one that was horrible! It went right back to the store. This one worked for the party. It was fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The slide is big enough for small toddlers. My LO isn't walking yet, so it was perfect for climbing and not deep enough to worry about her going under.<br />A nice size for 4-5 small toddlers<br />The water is a good depth. My daughter likes to crawl around in it, her head is safely above water (of course, watch your kids people!)<br />The sprinkler action kept the slide slippery and everyone cool in 100+ degree weather<br /><br />Cons:<br />The tree is annoying, it doesn't stay up very well<br />The &#34;extras&#34; aren't really needed- they ended up in the &#34;big kid pool&#34;<br />The sprinkler action is very difficult to adjust (okay, this might just be user error!), it was either too high or too low with just a slight movement of the valve<br />Draining this thing completely is a nightmare, if not slightly impossible<br />You can not use this without it being plugged in to the hose and the water on- it will not stay inflated.<br /><br />Overall, it was the best of what I had to choose from, it worked, but I am not in love with it.<br />(For what it's worth, my suggested age for this is 2 and younger. My new 3yo doesn't give it the time of day- my 1yo liked it better)
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|I'm almost 60 and have been a Priest fan on and off since the late 70's. This  video of their show is excellent. The sound is down and dirty and got the hair up on the back of my neck. I agree with some comments on the over use of quick camera angle cuts but the music cuts through it all. Driving my wife crazy with the volume but that's the only way to enjoy this. \\"Metal Gods\\" and \\"Prophesy\\" will get your head banging. Made me feel 25 again! Thanks for that.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting.  Different ending.  Lots of twists and turns.  Ending was not expected.  So very up to date and relevant.
B00338QENI|5.0|What a great book. The author shows an incredible amount of compassion for the Lacks family. I love this book.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Really great show. Love the story lines in fast paced New York. I wish there were more seasons to watch already.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I rate this app 0 stars because it wasted 10 of my gold bars. I was trying to &quot;expand all&quot; using my gold &amp; money but I didn't get the expansion.
B006LSZECO|3.0|For all the hype this was not my best read for the summer.  The who-done-it was a good spin but some parts didn't feel part of the story, to me.  For a summer read, okay.
0375413405|5.0|I always said, even before the movie, that Julia speaks to me through her books.  This one is particularly good at that.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Okay for a summer read.. The formular was tiring, to me and I was not engaged in places.  I like this author but book deals can quell talent.  A fair read.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|And I play some of the games on it.  But there are so many ads now - and I don't say anything on it that is about my life - I never add trips or events until they are over - and one whole side of my family refuses to use it at all so that both makes my life confusing because now so many &#34;friends&#34; believe I only interact with the side of the family that are fb addicts.  Oh well.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i thought the book was good maybe a little long. it wasn't a book i couldn't put down but definitely worth reading. she was as unbalanced as they come but i don't think he was too much better. i think they both got what they deserved.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really expected I would just read with my Kindle.  I got it as a gift and had never really wanted one.  But I find that I absolutely LOVE Amazon Prime shows.  I read a lot less than I thought I would, and watch TV shows and movies lots more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Hint for those of you who like to keep the TV on at night.  You can buy speakers that go under the pillow - plug it into your kindle and put on a TV show or movie that you like - listen to it and sleep well!  It keeps the lights and sound low for my husband and entertains me until I fall asleep.
B004LUS390|3.0|the app is glitching... what happening is that for example the past hour I've been working on brand new picture and ITS CLOSED ON ITS OWN I lost ALL of my work.<br />The spray paint tool doesn't work on top of colors anymore it just make I big pixelly blob.<br />I really REALLY hope you fixed this cause this is they second time its happened to me just this morning. ( 8/14/13)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|What an awesome movie.<br />Drama.<br />Action.<br />Suspense.<br />Amazing soundtrack.<br />Plot twists.<br /><br />What more could you ask from a movie?<br />This movie made me like Tom Cruise.<br />Enough Said.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't know who determines how/why an app needs upgrading, but that person should be fired.  I liked the convenience of being able to swipe between saved zip codes on my Fire, and I checked the pollen count forecast daily for my son, who has severe seasonal allergies.  I even tried to find a setting that allowed me to turn off the ad bar across the bottom; not available.  Like most of the people with the July '13  &quot;upgrade&quot;,  I will be removing this app and looking elsewhere for a weather app with local pollen info.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|The game is fun.  I enjoyed it on the ipad too.  The problem is that is can be a little buggy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's truly a compelling read. I highly recommend this book. It has all the depth of a dystopian struggle with a a flow that urges to keep reading.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app!! It helps me be and get organized. I really recommend it. Trust me, you won't regret it!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie kept me on my toes throughout all the scenes. I didn't know much about this incident prior to watching the movie but it made me want to learn more. Wonderfully done--great acting and writing and I found myself really connecting with the characters emotions. I would highly recommend this movie.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Pic does not save to my gallery. What good is this app. I will be dumping this app unless I can get a resolution.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The movie had melancholy undertones and a depressing feel throughout. The acting was decent but just wasn't a story that grabbed me personally. Perhaps in the medical field I see too much mental health to get into the story as much. I saw it on an airplane and it kept me occupied enough to get me through the flight quicker.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had these first in paper back and decided to get them in ebook format (less clutter). I love these books. They are my all time favorites. I love Christian and yes Ana gets on my nerves, but overall they rock. I love how EL James ties everything together. There are a lot of haters out there, but I am not one of them. I think these are amazing!
1581804849|4.0|like book and will be a great tool in learning how to paint and will use over and over like
B00846REIS|5.0|I originally bought this book in paperback and not got it in ebook format. I love this book SO much. I adore Eva (she is not a virgin and has a backbone). I LOVE Gideon, he is it for me. I can't wait to see what transpires between these two.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book was heart wrenching absolutely loved it. i recommend this book. i finished in two days it doesn't get better than that
B0086700CM|5.0|well this was my first app. But the game is great and the best free app ever! And its really addicting and fun. Love it and everybody must buy this app!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Great for travel. Lots of options. Easy to use. No problems with it not working when I need to use it.
160774273X|5.0|This book is quaranteed to give you a quality product.  Well written and comprehensive.  Great results for every recipe we've tried.
B000002KET|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend, but he just loves the CD. The seller shipped the item (which was just as described) very quickly
0375758992|5.0|This is Alexandra Fuller's best book by far.  It describes a childhood totally different from the average American's, and she is a talented writer, concise, direct, and thoughtful.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I found it wordy, and I found myself reading it just so I would say I finished it at book club.  Too many things were explained too much and others were not explained enough
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I am still unable to view most VIDEOS on the internet.  Not very usefully.  Would not waste time or space for download.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I had to restart my game for some reason after the update but I'm glad to have it running well again.  I am totally addicted.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Not the greatest acting, story is weak...if your bored this movie will kill a few hours, 5 dollars and some brain cells
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is really great !!(: i use it in the morning to wake up and i use it night also, no matter when you use it... It is super reliable !!
B00E8B1358|5.0|Hey, you expect a certain kind of movie when you see the name GI Joe.  And it delivers!<br /><br />No annoying subplots, convoluted twists and subtle intrigue here, just action, action, action!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I always loved playing the UNO card game, so when I seen that I could play it on my Kindle I had to get it.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|No wonder the movie tanked in the theaters.<br />The movie crept along and didn't have much to offer other than some cool visual effects.  Not enough to counter the lame, predictable plot and it's eventual ending.  We guessed the entire plot and ending perfectly, about 20 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />I am surprised that Tom Cruise signed up to do something this lame.  He must be hurting for money or something.<br />Morgan Freeman only has 10, maybe 20 minutes of screen time, TOTAL.  The producers must have known that the movie was a bomb, so they had to use another big name star on the marquee to draw unsuspecting movie goers into the theaters.<br /><br />I would avoid paying for this, and wait for the FX channel or Spike channel to show this for free.<br /><br />----Spoiler alert-----<br />At the end, we don't even get to see what the alien's look like.  Unless its supposed to be the block pyramid with a  giant red eye...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its awesome the best game I played since temple run and subway surer this game is just like the movie
B001NHNG64|5.0|couldnt put the book down. Already a big fan of Lee Child. Good that he have so many volumes of Jack Reacher
B009NY43NY|4.0|at least the last book went out with a blast... better than the couple previous books. always a fun summer series to read, have enjoyed looking forward to one or two the last few years, so kinda sad that's over.
B000FC130E|3.0|The premise is very original, the writing superb, but I doubt I'll finish the book. I preferred not to be tossed between the real world and some dark and demonic other world, of which I either couldn't or didn't want to relate. Maybe it gets better, maybe the 'normal' characters wind up playing a larger part of the story as it goes on. I can't say I gave it much of a chance based on this sort of theme.
B000NTMWYU|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out. Crowe is great as a commodities broker, managing a big firm. Uncle, (Albert Finny) passes, and leaves his vineyard to him. As a child he spent many days with his uncle, learned everything about wine and wine making. He has flashbacks of when he was young, and his relationship with his uncle. They had great times. He decides to sell the estate but then backs out of the sale, he tries to make improvements around the old place. He has to run interference with the couple who stayed on to manage the house and vineyard, and his uncle's unknown daughter, who shows up out of nowhere. There is a love interest, but she doesn't want to play, that doesn't stop him. They knew each other long ago. I won't go on any further, there are several plots, twists, and turns. Many funny situations, Russ carries it off well. Great actors all around.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons have really taken charge of their career.  The main reason I love them so much is because of the brilliantly poetic lyrics that take hold of the listener's emotions. I was in no way disappointed with this album after loving their first so much.
1401322786|2.0|As much as I have enjoyed Mitch Albom's other books, I found this one to be a bit of a stretch and a bit boring.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse has always been my favorite band, because through the length of their longer-than-normal career, they have shown continuity of sound in combination with musical development, which so many other bands are not able to accomplish. This album is a great example of that.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|The answer -- lots.. I knew of Sound City but not the in depth knowledge imparted in this documentary. Interesting to see how the music scene evolved there. Excellent documentary!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Hans Zimmer creates the mystery of the Sherlock Holmes stories through the script's version of Holmes's personality. Excellently written and quite entertaining to listen to
B003U69IX6|5.0|Terrific movie for the young and young at heart.  The Characters are very likable and the story line keeps you entertained.
B008645YEE|5.0|The movie would not have been what it was without this soundtrack. Hans Zimmer creates this world with the themes for the hero, the villains, and the settings within the story.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|Involved story line follows these seeminglty unmatched characters though years and changes in their relationship with the events of the day as the background.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I love what these men have been able to do. In my opinion, the versions of all the artists music that they do are much more entertaining than the originals. They have created a way to make classical instruments and music flow into the modern style of what we listen to today
B009NX409M|5.0|I love this movie.  I had no problems finding it.  It loaded perfectly.  It ran like a dream.  what more can I say
B005ZHB84U|5.0|This soundtrack is as genius as the film - a well constructed theme that went along with the style and acting of the movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed this more than I expected. I hadn't read through a book this quickly in ages. Looking forward to the next book.
B001C08RHA|5.0|With the technology of the modern cinema, there are often movies that focus way too much on the special effects. However, Iron Man is a great depiction of the superhero himself, along with some cool effects that enhance the story.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|it is a great soft/hard case. it does the job for my mom and her 15 grand kids that she has come over and play with her kindle.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love it! The parallel universe is just a great idea. Dr Walter is my hero!  Wish there were more seasons!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Broadly based on the book of the same name, Percy Jackson is entertaining and visually engaging. Not bad for the target audience. Fan of the book series will be disappointed as the movie takes broad license with the story and the series.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|keep your mind moving and thinkin. it also shiws you knowledge of differnt words. its a lot of fun and people will live it
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I haven't watched this series since I was in middle school. Back then, we watched it for the special effects. Now, what I notice most are the excellent story lines and the acting. The story lines must have been cutting edge in their time and they are very inventive as well as involving. The story lines keep you hooked from beginning until end. The acting is top notch, though because I've seen so many caricatures, it takes a while to adjust to William Shatner's style, which is unique. It does work well in the end, as Kirk is supposed to be brash and cocky. It's also a wonderful contrast to the cerebral Spock, played wonderfully by Leonard Nimoy. The rest of the cast are also excellent in their own individual ways. Nichelle Nichols is just gorgeous, so one does have to pay attention to more than her looks. I'm looking forward to seeing Season Two soon.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Loved the entire cast.  There were a couple of plot twists I didn't see coming. Very funny and I recommend it for adult viewers!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|An intelligient legal drama with a protaganist that is compassionate, sharp as a whip and beautiful to boot! We are really enjoying this first season and look forward to completing them all! Thanks for putting this show on Amazon Prime.
B003DT19F0|4.0|I purchased this DVD for my Grand Daughter and she dearly loves it.  It is a very good movie.<br />I would recommend it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is addicting! I love it! It is a lot of fun and some of the mini games are challenging.
0894803123|3.0|It is okay, but I was not impressed with it. I wouldn't purchase it again.  We are caterers and<br />we have some better recipes than some in this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My six year old bugged me for this. It's free. She really likes it. The minions are so funny. Recommend it
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book club pick. Would recommend to anyone to read. Also loved her book gone girl. Very exciting and fast read.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook started out by getting into other people's business.  Now they allow anyone and everyone to say exactly what they are feelig without thinking what's coming out of their mouths.  Yes, yes its a free country, but why is your freedom any more valuable than mine.  Why do I HAVE to listen to loud blaring music that is so vulgar it edges on soft porn...soft is a relative term!  Why do I have to read on FB every nasty word and unbelievable phrase that comes out of mouths if I don't want to.  It's there in black & white, it popps up, I don't look for it.  It has become a breading ground for porn, illecit sex, and even probably sex offenders &#34;where to find&#34;...I don't like FB anymore..sorry...
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I finally learned how to play this game and it's lots of fun, it's a great thinking game.  I recommend your kids try it.
B00AA03D18|5.0|It's just that good for five star rating. Very well written, will wake some people up about their lives and where they will end up when the end comes for them. I would recommend this book to everyone that can read.
B008Y6TGIY|4.0|Its funny, adventurous and musical and keeps both my kids entertained. (A 3yr old girl and a 4yr old boy)
B005LAIISA|5.0|I have all of the other Ice Age movies, so I bought this one without seeing it first. I wasn't disappointed! It's a super cute movie like all the rest!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Started off slow to load, but thats no biggie at all.  So far this is a fun game!!!!  so many options, so much cool stuff
1401923127|5.0|This was such an interesting book that I had a hard time putting it down. I am sure I will go back and read it again some day.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Wow this movie was amazing. One of the best foreign films ever made! It was beautifully made. The actors were awesome. It made me laugh and it made me cry. A truly moving film. A must see. I rented it from Netflix and just had to buy it.  Once in a while a film comes along that moves you and you can't forget it. this is one of those movies. Inspirational.  I have recommended it to everyone I know.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great story.  Fantastic stunts and special effects, but it did not feel like a video game.  Real characters that you care about and a really great story.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good film that followed the book somewhat. I wouldn't have even minded if it was longer to be closer to the book
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This story line was not as exciting as others.  Sort of felt like Jack was bored and just killed some time while waiting to catch a ride to Virginia.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love this app it's cute and funny I really like this application kids love it and it keeps them entertained
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Something different to kill some down time.  Went through the few free puzzles fast.  But that's okay...they have a reset, and I don't remember where things were from the first time. :D Enjoy.
161655164X|5.0|The art is just so cool to look at! It provides an amazing glimpse into the minds of the creators. If you're even a mild fan of the game, I highly recommend this.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|It works. I'm happy. :D  Slightly addicting. lol  Marathon played last night.  Need some serious mental down time.  This filled the bill. :D Enjoy.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|I have played about 30 levels and am really enjoying the game. While I haven't beaten it I would still love to see a board editor so players couldake and upload their own stages.  That would be very exciting
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Kept us up playing late, it's different than any other games, just challenging enough to be intriguing without it being too difficult.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album. There were several songs that I really liked, and I have already gone through the album at least three times since I bought it a few days ago.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show is so very addictive! I couldn't stop watching season after season on my Kindle....can't wait for the new episodes!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|what makes this app worth the dollar is the music you have on your device you can use for an alarm...and the different themes.
1939416019|1.0|I personally do not read much but I have read enough to know this book is pretty bad. The story line goes way to fast with no real direction. The characters are weak with no back story. I feel like most of the characters were bipolar or something. At one point they were being potrayed one way then the next it was like a different person with the same name.The book really need to be edited...it is written rather childishly. I feel like if you are going to write a book from the \\"mid-evil era\\"...at least have the knowledge for it. The whole thing was a hot mess.<br />I am actually extreamly upset that a book like this can be sold on here...it seems more like a rough draft than a final copy. I really want my money back.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|One of the best movies of all time, in my opinion.  Great acting and cast.  I hadn't seen this film in years and was excited to see if again.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|I love this series, even with the new actor. as usual its violent, entertaining and thrilling. must see. cannot wait till next series comes
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I really enjoy this album and I am happy I hear about it. It was a excellent purchase that I bought online this year.
B001O54NHQ|3.0|It's Batman, It's Prince. What more could you ask for. Great cruising music and always brings back memories to when it was new.
B00B18MQ7K|3.0|lost it in my documents, dunno. gonna try again. jove me some RT...seven more words=Richard Thompson is tha sh#t.true,very true
B0072IS13G|5.0|these are accurate scale collectables i bought for my daughter, made of a slightly soft plastic resin they seem to have all the correct markings, facial expressions and proportions correct, so far there's a good spread of selections available from Schleich
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Its hard to find a great horror movie. Most of them have a few creepy scenes, but nothing bone chilling scary. Gone are the days of Rosemary's Baby and the Exorcist. This movie was okay (like most horror films) but nothing to scream about.
B0072IUZUS|5.0|these are accurate scale collectables i bought for my daughter, made of a slightly soft plastic resin they seem to have all the correct markings, facial expressions and proportions correct, so far there's a good spread of selections available from Schleich
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Rented from Amazon instant video. Very creative and different perspective from the usual Wizard of Oz story lines. Worth a peek.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|this microSD card holder is almost as thin as a credit card as well as its other dimensions so it can be carried in my wallet's card pockets without much of a bulge problem. The other product I bought had about twice the thickness.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this thinking it would be another boring app that would keep my attention for a while. I was so wrong, this game is so much and the game is always changing which is nice this has bright colors and is very interactive and great for all ages
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I'm enjoying this period series and all the characters. The story lines are well written and following history is interesting.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book sucks ball i had to look for three hours to find the words genocide, Aryan, Ghetto, and Euphemism
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I bought a Blu Ray Sony and just had to have it on Blu Ray!  Great price! Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are marvelously cast!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game, only wish you could earn glu credits/gems. And are they serious about a100.00 dollar in app purchase. But still a good game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show surprised me.  I didn't think I would like it as much as I did.  I found many characters to love.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got subway suffers free from the app store and I love it so much I recommend this game to anyone boys girls men women anyone any age subway suffers is a game worth<br />getting and paying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game,you can do a lot of fun things like,defeat vector,be different minions and and earn points by doing despicable deeds. I really like it. Recommend it to all kindle users.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow so fun I even play with my kids and it is really awesome and fun to just have and see all of the reactions the minions have
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|New twist on how to bring your heart back to life. Lots of fun and sarcasm keeps one interested in this slow moving drama, horror, maybe a romance movie.
B003730LRY|3.0|Twisted dead people pretending to be alive in a comical extravaganza of one gag after another. No real plot but it meanders well enough.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Mind bending movies are not my cup of tea but this one went on too long. I wasn't happy with the ending and I didn't like any of the over and over again of to the future back to the past epileptic cinema.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Its interesting but it takes soooo long to get to the interesting plot of why they are so special while other children never got away from the evil witch.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Charging 1.99 per episode for this twisted tale is just one thing I didn't like about his show. It didn't hold my attention like the original did and the story line got lost in between the head mother and twisted doctor vying for the spot of who's more devious than the other. I thought it would be more interesting but it really wasn't. I might watch one more episode just to see if they fix their misguided horror and make it into something more palatable for horror watchers than just gore.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I love the character &#34;Jay&#34; and really appreciate that the writers of this program allow at least one male lead to sometimes appear intelligent, strong and compassionate. The kids are a scream.  Great acting all around!
B003YTPS7O|5.0|This movie is all about taking time to enjoy life. Plain, and simple; very refreshing.  This makes me want to change my job, and stop working so hard.
B001BC5HXG|1.0|As a veteran Kindle user, I find the prices for classics like these especially irritating.  There is simply no way that I will spend this much to have a Steinbeck novel on my Kindle, when I can go to a used bookstore and get it for much less.  C'mon Amazon, lower the prices of these classics and make the Kindle what you CLAIMED it was-a product and a technology that would brings us novels at significantly lower prices.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the characters! Love the plot lines! Love this season and the prior two! Very excited for the fourth season!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Did the review on the second book instead of number three.  Loved, loved, loved all three as did my husband.  Much more action in the bedroom after 41 years, YAY.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I consider this the best book ever.  From the very beginning until the end not one moment of disappointment.  Steamy hot sex and the perfect love story.  I will be a fan of E. L. James forever.  Hope she comes out with more, soon!!!
B003FSTN5C|5.0|NCIS: LA is a good series with great character development and action.  If you like shows like the original NCIS, you will like this.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I wanted to see this movie and it lived up to all the awards it recieved. Daniel Day Lewis and the other actors did excellent acting.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Very good Sci Fi movie that I have seen in a while that starts to reveal itself at the end!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|it's hard to find the objects and I wish you could build up your diamonds like you can build up your coins otherwise it's alright so far
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Excellent product, I like.<br />An excellent shipping, fast and safe.<br />I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Thanks amazon for their service.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Not worth the time and effort to find anything truly critical of it.  Sometimes I don't think I am in the mood for it but al ways always happy to have seen it. Witty, dramatic, snappy dialogue and even some villains who have few redeeming qualities. I admire the women for being able to be discreet rather than critical of their men, probably a much more effective  method of getting ones way. I  wish I had a helper like the sweet little girl in the kitchen. I have had very nice maids but none so truly involved.  I suppose that could become rather burdensome and if they actually paid as much attention to their household staff as portrayed, I would be quite surprise. I want to see Cold Comfort Farm for some contrast now.
B001W79MB8|5.0|Amazing, this movie was recommended to me by a lot of friends. And I say...... WOW..... it blew me away. Totally outside my level of expectations.<br />I recommend this movie for anyone, even if you are not an anime fan, you'll love it
B00A27X972|4.0|Always fun to read about aliens disguised as humans. In this novel, there are serious events, deaths, and difficult questions being asked about existence, and still, there is humor.  Haig used the set- up well and created an engaging story.
1609611543|5.0|I bought it because I heard the author interviewed on the radio.  What he says makes a lot of sense.  I am certainly not into diet fads, but I have no trouble in believing that reengineering wheat for better productivity can have had some bad consequences.  My granddaughter is allergic to gluten which is a major component of wheat.  I happened to mention to the postmistress that I had bought the book, and she told me a lot of my neighbors are allergic to wheat. (There are many diabetics around here which, if you read the book, could explain their allergies).  I love bread, and have not given it up by any means, but at age 86 I probably have developed defenses to the problem.  If this guy is right the people who did the reengineering have much to account for.  The author quotes a lot of research that, if true, is very compelling. At my age I am inclined to be sceptical of new things, but this guy really got to me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So far I am disappointed with this device.  It has limited functionality, does not work with chrome on my tablet and while I received an email from amazon stating that I will receive my netflix code 5 days after shipping of the device, I have not yet received it.  So...until there is more functionality developed for this, I am keeping it in its box.<br /><br />Update 8/22/13:  After contacting Amazon Customer service, the code was sent to me within 24 hours.  Netflix functionality and good customer service is worth a move from 3 to 4 stars.
B0094M4R3Q|1.0|The characters use terrible language. Not something you would want any child under 8 or 10 to hear. The adults are cruel and demeaning at every turn. So many better shows and movies to see don't waste your time.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|The movie was pretty good, but I think Johnny Depp's character could have used more of his facial expressions. The supporting characters were fun, and the story was pretty good.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I have been listening to Megadeth for years and years, since the mid-80s when a friend of mine introduced me to their demo tape. Its been a lot of years, I've seen them a dozen times.  I have every album.  They have been blowing Metallica away fro years. After Thirteen (or Th1rt3en if you prefer) I was still amazed.  Never has Megadeth let me down. There have been some missteps over the years, but nothing on the scale of St. Anger, so all was good with the universe.  When Super Collider was released, I immediately downloaded it.  Here is what I found...<br />Musically, this album, like all the albums that have preceded it, rox in most places!  You can't take that away.  Some of the riffs aresimply amazing (Chris Broderick).  It's hammering, relentless metal.  But... the lyrics here are the stumbling block.  I'm not sure what happened, I expect Dave's usual ranting and raving and intelligent social commentary, but what is here is tepid at best.  There are songs here that could be great if the lyrics weren't a cheesy as they are.  Kingmaker opens the album and although it sounds like a snapshot of most opening Megadeth selections, it's straight-forward and hard.  Megadeth being Megadeth.  Is that clich&eacute;? Perhaps. Some of this just seems like rehashed songs from the past and it just feels like Dave dialed in the lyrics here.  Some of the clunky rhymes are just bad. Pehaps with all the Big 4 Stuff and touring and whatever, Dave didn't set aside enough time to take a serious stab at the lyrics.  Am I wrong?  Listen for yourself.  A true Megadeth fan would agree that Don Dokken might have snuck into the studio to rhyme some fire with desire.Overall, a disappointment.  After Th1rt3en, I expected more. Maybe next time around.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I liked the story on the big screen, and have not watched the disc yet.  The CG were excellent in the movie, and it moved right along.
B0094M0P4G|4.0|I had a friend that raved about this movie and insisted a &#34;must see.&#34;  Christina Aguilera is amazing in this role (although Cher is no slouch) - a wonderful surprise to also see Alan Cumming in a bit part.  The dancers are top notch and fun to watch the routines.  If you like Cabaret, you will enjoy Burlesque.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I think the message behind this cute animated film packs a strong punch.  A lot of people can probably relate to being brought up with not feeling &#34;good enough&#34; by their parents who raised us.  To build a family of our own that not only gives us strength but change us for the better.  To open our hearts and let love in.  Deeply moved.  And yes, it was very funny.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like the ease of playing this game. There are always tons of people playing UNO. I'm occupied for hours!
B0007W0MTA|5.0|This is the best retrospective I have heard of one of the most important Jamaican artists ever.  Top notch from the early 60s to the more recent material.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a hard time going to sleep due to pain. I use this to &quot;tune out&quot; the pain and rest a little better. I love all the sounds available for free but may try the paid version too.
1449410243|5.0|I bought this book since it is recommended by Colonel Meow as required human reading. Having a kitty for the first time in my life, I know only what my sweet, mild mannered British Shorthair GiGi has taught me about felines. Boy, was I shocked! The book is a scream, and it is quite a conversation piece on my coffee table.
B00422LESO|4.0|I let my imagination take over while reading this book. I enjoyed the premise, characters and countryside. Such a charming existence I'd  be bored in 10 minutes let alone three weeks. I am looking forward to the movie release next month.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|I am still trying to get use to it.  I need to work with it more in order for me to really get a handle on it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy the Bible app. I try to keep up with my daily Bible<br />Reading and the reminder is helpful. I recommend this app.
B005JCT4B0|5.0|I love this collection!!!  All the greats in one spot, and at a very affordable price.  It's the perfect road-trip companion, if you don't have access to Liquid Metal.  :-)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I'm completely speechless!! This book's an amazing sequel to City of Bones!!!! I was up all night reading this book and after it was done I couldn't stop thinking on what's going to happen next!!! That's all I have to say!!!
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|i loved watching this movie. many were worried that this movie would bring disaster, but some very talented and hard working storytellers have saved twilight and her frineds from that disaster. the characters were spot on and the music and story are a delight.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love all the actors in this show and the storyline is captivating.  Unlike other series, Downton Abbey keeps getting better with each new season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Kids love this game and they laugh like crazy everytime they play it..good job with this game..u guys shoupd make more like this
B004LQEYAG|5.0|This is a classic. It's the quintessential buddy movie. It may not be historically acurate, but the story is absorbing and the chemistry between Newman and Redford heightens the fun and the drama. It has been quoted in numerous subsequent films and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys a good film.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|A slow starting novel that picks up after The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing. Jumping from one time period to the next made for a creative read. Stick with it through a slow beginning and thank yourself when it all ends. I'll definitely be looking into his other novels!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|An excellent show, and well presented by Amazon.  The broadcast was clean, with good sound quality, and easily useable.  Thank you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best app that man it self made<br />All it probably needs is railroad tracks and the game will be completed
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's laugh out loud funny and so entertaining. The main character is so relatable and clever. This is a perfect read for any woman!
B00364K6YW|3.0|This one is okay - but extremely long and does not have the truly romantic ending that the one with Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden played in!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Oblivion was a beautiful movie. I want a bubble ship that I can drive around! It was worth seeing. Enjoy!
B00003JRCQ|3.0|This was good but not as outstanding as many of Jane Austen's other stories! But if you like her then you will enjoy this one, too!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game. Lots of game time. You will enjoy it...give it a try. The price is right. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy..
B000784WMW|5.0|I would definitely recommend this one! I have always loved period pieces and especially anything that was written by Charlotte Bronte'.
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick<br />this music rocks this is by far one of the best rock bands there is still original full throttle rock and roll
0789204096|3.0|What a surprise when I found out I ordered a book of miniscule size. Past that, I love anything Rockwell. However, the illustration quality was poor. I would have liked it better, otherwise.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|There are a lot of Science Fiction movies out there that have good plots but really poor acting and even poorer special effects, and there are Science Fiction movies out there that have great special effects but terrible acting and even worse plot. Oblivion was a simple well acted Science Fiction movie. The plot was simple no hidden message, no political statement just simple fun to watch. I have decided to buy a copy of this movie and put it in my Science Fiction collection. I think this movie will become more popular over the years to come because it is a good easy movie to watch.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Season 1 was much better than ok. However by the time you get to season 2, you notice you have missed some episodes. I should say a lot of info has happen, Like mothers dying etc. season 1 was only 3 episodes,
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I had seen bits and pieces of this movie over the years<br />but never saw it all in one sitting.<br />I enjoyed it.<br />A bit predictable at times, but overall well<br />acted and written.<br />Particulary liked Danny Glover as the judge.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Once I started believing, my life completely changed in just two months. I tell everyone and now my sister is reading. I can't say thank you enough in a day
B0011AQLZQ|1.0|I have the 8-film Blu-Ray-DVD collection, but I wanted to get the movies for my iPad for when I'm not home, so I got the SD-version for $7.99. The quality is so poor, it is not even worth a dollar. The video was bleary, unfocused like it was filmed thru a cloudy, dirty lens. I could barely make out Dumbledore's features and backdrop was even worse, couldn't see Privet Drive at all. The audio was poor too - I had the volume turned up high, yet the sound was muffled. It is not my wireless that is the problem - I played back my other instant videos (ie Walking Dead and an old black and white film, L'Avventura) and they looked great. I tried playing this video on my desktop, which has a wired Internet connection, and the video/audio quality looked just as bad. Luckily, Amazon customer service is excellent. I may get in HD soon see if there is a significant difference in quality.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Thank u for making this free when I go on a trip the baby stay s occupied for the ride.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My 9 month old LOVES walking everywhere with this walker. It's sturdy enough to stabilize him and light enough for him to maneuver. The toys are in front are fun for him too!
B00DI75SWM|1.0|It wasn't what I expected at all!!! I can do the same with a graffiti maker from the Apple app store.  I expected more from it and the screenshots are very misleading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I enjoy playing this game is just like being on the computer.  I would recommended to all minecraft lovers. COOL
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app it's all that I was expecting! It is the same as the Apple app store egery thing is exactly the same for the same price.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music. I play this CD after dinner to encourage my youngest to have a quiet play and the older children are doing their homework.  I play it in the morning to gently wake up everyone in beautiful music.  I play it on lazy Saturday afternoon.  I play it all the time when I am in a good mood or when I need a good mood.  BEAUTIFUL!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I just recently started watching Suits. It's a different kind of legal drama I enjoy it.  If you liked season one then season two starts off a little slower but it picks up and doesn't disappoint.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|perfect for the whole family<br />made for everyone.  fun never stops. lots of challenges. I would recommend. this game to anyone.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great and very useful app.  Needed something that would wake me but I got the added bonus of music and local weather.
0679805273|5.0|Love this book! I read it to my son all the time. Although it is a second hand book its in great condition. There was a bit of writing on the inside cover but its very minimal. Its a great buy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It has everything  from an adventure  to a romantic  comedy. I love how they put you into each persons perspective .
0425252868|5.0|First, a big thank you to the author for all the work writing this book.  I was not quite sure what I was getting to read and generally do not read non-fiction.  The book kept me captivated throughout.  I took it along to the beach and read it in less than 3 days.  I especially enjoyed the ending of  the book.  There tend to be few books that are written from the German side of the war.  I highly recommend this book if you enjoy books from this period.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game needs more levels but I like it a lot and the most challenging level to me is 7 but other than that really fun so if u like an easy challenge download this now I love it so if u want to download do it
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|can not open game after last update.was a wonderful game until crash. spent real money I will never get back.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Had a laugh or two in the beginning .the middle was slow in places but I was really wanting to know how the author would pull it together ,and I was glad I finished the book with many laughs . Would recommend it to friends for a light read
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|OK game. Love angry birds, but difficult to get other friends and family online to play at the same time.
B004NELBPC|5.0|This is the best app on my phone.  It is great when it works..  I find the pages load slowly, I cannot view pictures.  It errors out on me.  Still I will not give up on Huff POST.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I love all the characters and they r so much like a real modern day family, u laugh a lot but also learn that a family can be formed in any way shape, or size.
B009ME47H2|3.0|It definitely is easy to use but the microphone from the kindle just isn't good enough to pick up decent signs quality.  It's passable at best.
B00E193Y36|5.0|It is an awesome CD that keeps your ears pounding and your heart pumping. The live stuff is great and makes me want to go see them live even more than I did before hearing the disk!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She's hilarious and insightful! She brought up some very important issues for women, but laced through this nice edge of humor. Totally recommending to all my friends--men and women!
0393316041|5.0|This book is a quick read that shines a light on a genius to make him more approachable and more understandable.  I loved this book.
B005KB0SU6|4.0|I like the book because is the continue of two others books. Good action, suspense and use of vocabulary. Good character and places description. Great use of humor. I don't like the devil presence.
B004I744AS|3.0|its simple, its okay for my 3rd grader. its easy acess to use from the kindle HD, and its free!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is an amazing book!! Hilarious too! :)<br />Love  Jeff Kinney!! Also really love the art . In it. The story is more alive!! Thanks for making Jeff Kinney!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Good book if you like mysteries.  Also, gives an excellent picture of London and England during the early days of WWII.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Written in a very user friendly manner, the author's tone is easy to understand and follow.  His academic approach does not inhibit understanding, rather it enhances and simplifies the understanding of the non scholar of the time and politics of the era.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this book in preparation for the movie coming out.  I was recommended this book by several friends.  I don't read very much at one time usually but with this book I found myself reading for 2-3 hours at a time.  I finished it very quickly because I was so enthralled with the story.  It is different from anything else I have read.  The world that was created here is unique and captures your attention with ease.  I will be continuing the series soon!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|ok so I loved this game till they did the update...now I cant even get into the game. it keeps telling me to download the update in the store and I already have going from a five star down to a one star. fix it!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The acting was wonderful and the ending  brought tears to my eyes.  This is the best version of Les Miserables I have seen.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|When trying to open the app I'm told to visit the store for an update.  In the store there is no update tapping on open only loads the game telling you to visit the  store for an update and you can no longer play. So now it gets a 1 rating.  Fix the glitch and it will be a 5.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really liked the first 2/3 especially the parts in Afghanistan. But as it went on there were too many coincidences, too many tenuous connections between characters.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|Very depressing, I  couldn't decipher what they were trying to depict. The drill scene at the end was disgusting. Bad
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|This will never go down as the best movie of all time, let alone the best Tom Cruise movie, but it was an entertaining way to spend two hours.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Action packed and great movie. Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job in this film. Haven't read any of the books. They must be great because this movie was pretty awesome.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|This soooo coool whoever says they don't like it didn't listen to it. Try typing a reference you like you will find many great mixes.
0316247545|5.0|Surprisingly thick book for the price, details galore and very aesthetically pleasing, I would recommend this to any fan of the show.
0894803123|4.0|I did not know that there were so many different ways to make ice cream. I was use to watching my uncle add the fresh cream from miling that morning and cracking away.
B00005MP58|5.0|I originally saw this on PBS, and loved it.  About as close to the book as you can get.<br /><br />Great!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an exceptional read, a riveting story of patriotism and unimaginable sacrifice.  Mr. Luttrell is a gifted writer and tells his story well, without unnecessary bravado or embellishment.
B004DZXC30|5.0|5 STAR LOVE THIS MOVIE AND LIKE THE FAST PACE, EXCITEMENT, AND MOST OF ALL THE<br />FUN THESE MEN HAVE.....THE HUMMER IS SO GOOD!!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I love watching the Rock. I enjoyed the movie. I would watch it again. I hope there's a third to GI Joe.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love using this app. It is easy and fun. I would recommend this to horse lover's who cannot afford their own horse.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Zac Brown Band?  My kinda music!!!  I'm a big country music fan and nobody does country better than Zac Brown Band!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The book is written in a very engaging and simple way. Cases are easy and the habit cycle is so simple and well explained that you can start applying the knowledge either to daily life or your marketing ideas.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Great feel good movie. The acting is just ok but the real story here is that real U.S. Navy Seals were used to film the movie using reenactments of real life missions. The action sequences were awesome as well as the feel of the movie. Kudos to our brave soldiers. God Bless them.
B005D4YHCU|4.0|These have become my favorite shoe. I bought these after enjoying the Wal-mart knock-offs for several years. These are many times better, as expected. They are very comfortable, breath well and are well constructed. They are a big snug on my feet, so going up a full size might be considered if you're looking at buying a pair. I went up a half-size and they squeeze a little, but I'm breaking them in.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|Another good Mel Gibson movie. Fun and different. Very talented actor. The premise is different. Overall if you like Mel Gibson you should like this movie
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This has been a fun challenging game to play.  I like playing it in the morning with by coffee.  It gets my brain working
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movies is such a classic, and I love it dearly. Everything about it is just so perfect, and I love this Disney classic in particular because of how colorful it is. I had to buy it because my boyfriend has never seen it, and I would love to see it over and over again, so why not buy it?
1401941893|4.0|Treasure yourself is a blend of a celebrity diary, a daily meditation book and 14,000 ways to be happy, poured into a petite pink binding. I do enjoy the back half of the book which focuses on daily meditations where each page is broken into three parts. Each page headlines with a short quote for meditation, the middle has a different butterfly of assorted colors and configurations then Ms. Kerr includes a few short lines delving deeper into the underlying concept of each meditation quote. The meditation quotes are by Deepak Chopra, Louise L Hay, Steven R Covy, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Brian Wiess MD, and the author, among other notables.<br /><br />My opinion this book has too much ego blended in so I would give it a 3 star rating.. but for the right audience (not me) it is a 5 star book so I'll settle on 4 stars.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I saw this movie originally when it came out - I was 9 months pregnant with my first son and wished to have the body that she did. . . I loved to dance and the passion that she had was what I dreamed of.  Funny to see the actors today (her in Castle) and the guy as the father of Ziva in NCIS... proves just how long it's been. But all in all, I really like this movie.
B00004W221|5.0|THE TRUE STORY OF NOTRE DAME PLAYER RUDY RUDIGER AND HIS STRUGGLE TO BECOME A PLAYER ALL ON HIS OWN MONEY USED FOR TUITION AND DREAMS OF WALKING OUT ON THE FIELD FOR JUST ONE GAME PROVING TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS HE COULD DO IT. THE REAL RUDY RUDIGER MAKES A CAMEO APPEARENCE IN THIS GREAT FILM..LOOK FOR HIM AMONG THE PLAYERS. THE BEST TRUE MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN AGES AND RECOMMENDED FROM ME TO YOU. DON'T MISS OUT OR YOU WILL BE SORRY..RUDY IS PLAYED BY SEAN ASTIN AN ASPIRING YOUNG ACTOR.
1616550414|5.0|It's got so much awesome art and fantastic back story, if you like LoZ, you NEED this. It is awesome.
B009LREA1S|5.0|The Batman fanchise just keeps getting better.  The film gives Batman more humanity than his constant beating of bad guys.
B0068FZ0GK|2.0|As it was described in the sale, I was under the impression this was a double disc set, which is what I wanted. However this is just the movie, no extras or bonus footage. Maybe you should give a better description of items. This is why I cancelled my Prime account.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Awesome! It hooked right up, no worries, great for a mac! I am using this with a fishman and garage band
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game and my little one can play it too!!! He loves to feed Beauty and groom her. He is starting to get the hang of running with her but he no quite there. It's just a nice quiet game with no violence.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I have not used this too much yet but it seems to work and I wanted to see if I could learn to play the piano without putting too much money in it.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Quality picture and sound than my VHS recording of the film. A great story because i enjoy history type films. Tragic for Barry Lyndon as far as his life went.
B008ZVXNX2|5.0|If you loved Fifty Shades, you will love this music.<br />Great background music for no matter what you are doing.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My favorite movie in 2012. Went to cinema 6 times to watch it. Love all the superheros, and Loki XD
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was a great read.  The characters were well developed considering the short timeframe covered in the story.  Lots of twists and turns. I got so into it that instead of doing my usual 30 minutes on the bike at the gym I road 45 minutes just to see what happened next.
B009AMAJVO|1.0|This movie drags along as well as jumps around.  It lacks character development and is confusing all the  time.  You are not sure why people are being killed until almost the end of the money.  If you are a diehard Farrell and Howard fan, in my opinion you will be disappointed.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Special efects, actors, costumes, edition and specially the plot are awesome. This is 100% science fiction and yet so true.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|We expect our dogs to figure out our language without making the effort of reading their cues and body language. This book is very helpful in pointing out canine vs. human behaviors. Enlightening!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is such a fun game. I think it is such of fun game. I love getting the free lotto thing and getting to create my own zoo. I love finding the animals and I love how they added the dinosaurs. I wish that you could release the dinosaurs
B004K58GSO|5.0|I watched this as s kid and I still enjoy it. I watched this with my boy, and he was telling me how he was dreaming of being a cowboy just like John Wayne. I remember the same feeling watching this as a kid. This has some shooting in it naturally, but not to the grotesque way of today's films. Everything is done minimally. There is some cussing, nothing remotely close to what you see today. Very mild by today's standards.<br /><br />Boys can learn a lot about what it means to be a real man watching John. His legacy lives on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good.I love how it makes all time fly by.I love to play this game with my friends and compare scores as well.I tell every one about this wonderful great game.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|The biggest problem with Elysium is that despite its stunning visuals, it still ends up being a formula-driven, dull, and unimaginative film.<br />Characters on both sides of the good v. evil spectrum are two-dimensional and exaggerated; we are asked to believe that wealthy people are Nazi-like for no other reason than simply being in the top 1% of the economic scale. The poor, by contrast, are righteous and fighting for a better world. There is no middle ground, and as a result, no plausible or believable people populate this cookie-cutter world.<br />The movie is also plagued by overused and ineffectual story-telling techniques. We have the usual little kid, in this case a girl, who is in dire need of medical attention, always on the brink of death but never actually in any danger at all. Also present is the ever-overacted computer hacker, whose criminal exterior belies his more noble character, and whose skills at reading and manipulating computer code defy even movie logic - one small glance at millions of lines of hex, and he immediately discerns it’s a rebooting program to reset the entire space habitat known as Elysium.<br />Half way through the film, we know how everything will turn out; we know who will live and who will die; we know how the “good” guys will defeat the “bad” guys, and saddest of all, we still have to sit through another 45 minutes of pointless action to arrive at the predictable conclusion.<br />In the end, Elysium feels like a poorly-written sermon on the evils of wealth, with all the extreme simplification of  political parties and not a shred of cleverness to at least make it entertaining.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|An almost good story.  Other stories by Lee Child are better, Nothing to Lose just didn't seem to have<br />the punch that I have become accustomed to.  I cannot quite put my finger on it but the story is a bit<br />outside of the box.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|I always like a good submarine movie. It's not in the same calss as Crimson Tide or Hunt For The Red October, but still worth the watch. Ed Harris is always great!!!
B001NLL8LA|3.0|Surprising the number of corpses left behind Jack Reacher's trail, not a favorite of mine.  Keeping score of the<br />body count and how they died, a bit to the extreme.
B0063HC7EQ|2.0|I returned the Kindle edition of this book as soon as I could. The lines of text are too close together and it makes for a visually uncomfortable read. Nothing wrong with the book itself, just with the layout.
B005ZB91KY|2.0|This is a bad movie.  The beginning was okay but too long.  They had some major stars like Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones but they can't carry a bad movie.  Unfortunately, Captain America doesn't fit the coolness factor that Iron Man and other Marvel characters do.
B00AYR2FOI|2.0|I first heard Boz when I lived in Northern California in the late 60's and early 70's.  I loved the first few albums, especially the first one.  I loved Boz's vibe.  I loved that he rode his motorcycle with full leathers into Bill Graham's upstairs office.  I loved that he stood up to Bill Graham and that he, unlike others, really came out on top.  Boz issued quite a few radio friendly and classic cuts from the late 60's to the late 70's, some AM oriented and others FM oriented, such as Loan Me A Dine - an absolute f'ing classic.  I still love to hear that song.  Somewhere along the way I think that Boz lost his way and did not do it for me any more.  Then, I saw the hype about this new album, saw him on late night TV and really was hoping that he had re-found  his roots and had issued a new classic.  So, I ordered the CD and found a good time to listen to the whole CD in one sitting.  WOW, what a disappointment.  Some classic songs, but such an uninspired and generally boring performance.  I know that Boz can do better, but this is not it.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|Very accurate when using for distance to flag stick.  The farther the target the harder it is to steady.  It is more difficult to get a consistent reading from a tree or bush.  All in all I am quite pleased with the performance.
B0044LHN0G|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing, but how could it not be when you put John Williams together with Yo-Yo Ma, they are just both amazing at what they do, and the soundtrack does capture the feel of the movie.  This is one of those cases where I actually like the soundtrack much more than the movie.
031603441X|4.0|Keith Richards' \\"Life\\" is a crazy chronicle of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. Mostly drugs, actually.<br /><br />The book gives an inside look at life on and off the road with the Rolling Stones, starting before the beginning of the band and continuing through to the present day (or at least until the book was published in 2011).<br /><br />At times it reads like someone turned on a tape recorder and just transcribed Keith's stories of the band, the music, the groupies (including the wife of the Prime Minister of Canada), the drugs, the drug busts, and power struggles with Mick Jagger. It's often very stream-of-consciousness and, at nearly 550 pages, could have been edited quite a bit more tightly. But hey, Keith's a songwriter not a novelist.<br /><br />It's a fun read if you don't mind details about his coke and heroin use.<br /><br />I've loved the Stones for decades and found myself pulling out my old vinyl to get a new perspective on the songs I grew up with.<br /><br />If you're a Stones fan it's sure to provide insight into the greatest rock band in history.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Amazing. Simply amazing. I've seen the whole first season before but it never hurts watching it again. Sherlock is just so amazing. In fact I wanted Amazon instant video mainly to see this. This has to be the best Holmes and Watson played characters yet. I just hope more seasons are to come. The video play great by the way. No complaints.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Got this on a Free day and still over paid. What's the first thing you do? You open a photo to edit. Bzzzz... wrong. It wouldn't let me do the first step. Other complaints about this app says they can't save. I can't even get that far. I would have been pissed if I paid the $5, but I'm just annoyed that it wasted my time. Uninstalling. Zero stars!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice 3 month Netflix deal, great price, super fast shipping.<br /><br />Streams high quality videos from YouTube which is great as I watch hour long episodes.  Arrived just in time for the current season of the show I watch.<br /><br />Netflix on it is nice too of course. Much more convenient to use than Roku menu wise and time to boot and all that.<br /><br />I like that you can use the remote Android app, but yet once the command is issued, it doesn't use my phone's cpu/battery.  A huge plus.<br /><br />All in all satisfied greatly with it.  Hope they add more apps like Amazon Video to it soon!  C'mon Amazon, work with them to get the Amazon Video app on it! :o)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have no idea what the site is for really; but my wife totally loves it! If she's happy, we're all happy. The entire world.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kept me entertained. Need more rooms! Will recommend to others who enjoy puzzle type apps. Would be awesome if had more rooms.
B00D5TASN2|5.0|This album is more of what you expect from an artist at the top of his game. Haunting, ethereal, comforting music from the master himself. Do not hesitate to buy this album. You will love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so amazing everyone should try it all ages I love el macho's lair it is very very cool
B00634GHJA|5.0|Easily move pictures to and from my phone/computer.  No more lost pictures.  I would highly recommend this app to everyone
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I checked this out on plugged in online first to see if it was appropriate for my teens and it was.  Be cautious though as it does have much violence.  It is nice when they make an action film that is not full of other garbage.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Have listened to this CD a thousand times. Seen the PBS special.  Want to go to Portofino! So romantic, lovely
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I don't care to much for Tom Cruise. But this is a good one!!<br /><br />Morgan Freeman was great as usual.
B008476HBM|5.0|The book was so good and I do own the movie.  I have watched the DVD many times and I can't stop until it is finished.  Wonderful story.
0812982622|4.0|This is a book that I am glad I read because it opened my eyes to life in North Korea.  The author is a great writer and is able to keep the story line in context of the reality of North Korea.  But the storyline is one that will eat at you because of all the human abuse that exists to keep it in context.  It certainly is not a pleasure read.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this as a kid and I got it for my niece she loves it, wants to watch it again, although she can’t believe the goblin king can sing that well as he is to mean to have that good a voice.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|If you have seen the Broadway play then you will probably find this film somewhat lacking.  They went for the big stars and as such some of the singing is not what you had in the Broadway production.  Russell Crowe is a great actor but not a great singer so if you are really into the music of this production this will disappoint you.  I personally was disappointed in the computer graphics they used because they were so obviously computer graphics.  My daughter loved it so for some it is great.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great introduction to leadership skills & shows how we often take care of the weak and ignore the super inteligent.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|If I were rating this movie solely on acting, etc. I would consider it great.  I personally don't like the story line - it shows all this is bad about humans and not much good so that is why the lower rating.  This is not the fault of the movie just the book from which it was taken.  So if you like negative reality you will love this movie.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I play on kindle android phone and computer it freezes on all periodically. You can play for free but not unlimited play. right now getting lots of connection errors on mostly kindle sometimes other 2.  losing credits especially if you purchased them! but I keep playing so must like it
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Unable to play beyond level 2, I can not pick up one of the pieces I need to continue. Enjoyed first two levels wish I could play more
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is a must read for all human beings.  It makes sense in every aspect of life.  I only wish I had known about it earlier.  The content of this book is life changing.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|OK so their voices aren't the greatest but I thought they all did an admirable job and my musical son LOVED it.  Only gave it four stars just because its so sad.  But truly a great story and very well done.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I'm so excited that I finally got an app that I like...this is an awesome game...have fun playing! I know I will!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like all the characters in Season 1. They acted well enough that I wanted to see all the episodes in Season 2!
B0000VCZKW|1.0|I put this in my DVD player after unwrapping it and it does not work! S***TY Product DO NOT BUY!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This is a huge kit, and well worth the price. It kept my hubby busy for hours and now is patrolling my living room (well from a static position that is).<br />There are a few fiddly bits with the latter parts of the construction, but that's part of the appeal for &#34;lego engineers&#34;.<br />Definitely recommended.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Super fun game. Enjoyed the length of it and the finding of objects but didn't play Dominoes once. Would enjoy more games like this one!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Cute game to play with the kidos nice pictures and style fun for all ages give it a try!!  Now
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My friends and I love this game! So addicting (in a good way) and it's perfect if you're bored!! I would definitely recommend this game to everyone. Easy to play. Fun. No crashes. Ever. Download!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Enjoyed every minute. Very entertaining. I would def watch it again. Cooper was very believeable.  Good date night flick.Rec ommend.
B001TH16DI|5.0|He loves it.  For a trekkie, this is a must have.  Not too expensive and well worth it.  A guess some of the movies were duds, like every other one, but for a true fan you still squeal in nerdy delight.
B00000ITOY|5.0|Nice quality wood toy. Great step between beginner puzzles and interlocking ones.<br />Great for little problem solvers & puzzle lovers.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used this program for years and it has worked very well on my computers.  I think its as good as Nortons and thought I have used the Free version I also recommend the version that you buy.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Because my fingertips didn't always make contact with the screen, this stylus made it much easier to navigate the screen and at the same time keep it fingerprint free.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Classic movie with a good storyline. Tom hanks plays his role well. If you live under a rock and havent seen it you should definitly check it out.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of this case for my Kindle. It is very well made and rotates very easily.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved this movie.  I saw &#34;Les Miserables&#34; in the theater when it was first out and never could figure out why people in such deplorable conditions would be singing such nice music.  The actors in the movie really show their emotions both physically and with their voices.  The songs while still beautiful sound angry and upset.  Great acting and singing!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I just had to read it again...a story of triumph in the face of great poverty and adversity.  A story about family and what love truly is all about.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game was fun until I was made to download an update now I can't access the game at all.  If I start again I will lose all my progress
B0049D1TCM|5.0|If you love Nicki, you have to get this album in your collection!  There is something for everyone on this pink list.

B005LAII44|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS AWSOME AND REALLY ENJOYED IT AND THINK MY FAMILY WILL TOO&#62; HOPE TO HAVE THEM WATCH IT THIS WEEKEND
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I personally am a great fan of both the era and of the type of show. I was not disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Your latest book is always close at hand and allows you to relax anywhere! I love the convience of the android !
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I enjoy the game, but when I get to level 4 under Infinity, the game freezes my tablet after the 4th 'retry'.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.<br /><br />My friend tried it on her Samsung Galaxy Note tablet and it also froze in the same location.<br /><br />On both tablets, the games uses a lot of power; after 15 minutes of play, my battery was down 50%. I usually am able to go 4-5 hours on a full charge.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I do love Matt and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. Completely kept my attention from start to finish. Great plot line.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Exceeded my expectations!!<br />Able to watch movies/TV hands free<br />Cover is lightweight<br />It helped that it was om sale!  Yeah
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game!! Can't stop playing!!! Better than any game I've ever played!! Love beating my facebook friends scores!
B004ZNARH4|2.0|Yes , this review has nothing to do with the musical and visual contents within. I'm hoping to find some amazing stuff should all of my discs not be too scuffed up from sliding around the bottom of the box. The seller packaged this properly for delivery, the box set was sealed and came at a teriffic price.However the bozos at EMI/ Capital should have designed a package that protects the 1st four cds as well as it protected those stupid marbles it comes with. We bought this for the music most of all, you would think they would at least pack the cds in shrink wrapped cardboard cases at least. No they come unsafely protected in that junky felt covered tray on the bottom. Shame on the manufacturer and package designer, you should flip for the cost of the replacing the 4 cds out of your own pockets and mail them to every buyer of this set with a hand written apology, and please use jewel cases !
B009KS4XRO|4.0|love this game. Wait patiently daily for my free bingos. they disappear much too quickly though as I am not very lucky. the slots are fun too and pay fairly well
B00946ZOT8|5.0|Part of the Twilight Saga.  My wife wants to collect the whole crew.  Just a great collection to add to
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked the way Landay developed the characters.  I  had to try to get into their minds to come to conclusions. The mother's struggle was so painful. The father seemed totally convinced of Jacob's innocence, with nothing to back him up.<br /><br />Even at the end, her decision was the most poignant. I found myself wishing she had been able to die in the crash, but then the father's life would be totally empty.<br /><br />It was a very good read, even though sad.
1452000247|5.0|Of course, I'm biased. What's not to like, magical adventure, creative and unusual characters... this book is for young and old. What is it about wardrobes, broom closets, mirrors? My name is Peter, but there's nothing exciting when I look into them... except for that one time... well, that's not about this tale.<br />I do fully recommend this story for anyone wanting to be transported into another world, for a thoroughly enjoyable read.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Boring, boring, and more boring. Exceptionally predictable.... and to be honest, despite the attempt at character building... by the end of the movie, I couldn't have cared any less what happened to each of them. Just didn't grab me.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|this is a wonderful comedy movie with fantastic actors Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. both are fantastic and funny. It is a really good movie with humor, love and understanding. I love this movie so much I saw already 3 times and I will see again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game all the around very addicting I can't stop playing it great graphics and a lot of fun l
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the characters.  Excellent writing.  Very realistic in the litigious realm!  Watch it all the time.  I've recommended it to everyone.
B007NR9WBG|1.0|Most of the movie is not widescreen at all, but in a reduced, postcard like size. The only time the widescreen format is used is when we are to see the effects of the invention through the users eyes. The entire reproduction is a joke! Buy the regular DVD and enjoy this fine movie. The Movie industry and us, the Movie loving public are being victimized by corrupt reproduction companies selling  low grade trash as improved upgrades! This is a terrific movie. Natalie Woods' last and certainly one of her best. It deserves much better than this!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome show!  Great story and the characters are lovable and fun to watch develop.  Definitely recommend this show to anyone!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Just wish that Candy Crush was avaliable on my Kindle, I love the game just didn't find the hints very helpfu.
0399160450|4.0|As always, Mr. Clancy has done a good job with Threat Vector. It was also wonderful to be able to purchase a near-new copy on-line for less than new.<br /><br />Dr. Jones
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|This was and ok game to play just got boring after a while, and got tired of playing it. moving on.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I understand that some people will love something while others will hate it. Although this movie has some awesome CGI, the story was too slow and confusing for me.<br /><br />The first 50 minutes of the movie is basically Tom and his \\"girlfriend\\". She sends him out on missions and he comes back. Nothing much more than that. Around that 50 minute mark, others appear in the movie and this is where it gets confusing. The makers of the movie just start throwing stuff at you from all sides.........all of a sudden Tom Cruise has a wife. Morgan Freeman shows up and tosses in some more confusion. Then there are two of Tom. By the way........Morgan Freeman's appearances are short and he is not in the movie very much.<br /><br />Honestly, even til the very end, I had no idea what was happening. The only reason I continued watching the movie was the computer generated imagery. Not as great as \\"OZ The Great And Powerful\\" but still impressive. This movie has a lot of eye candy in it.<br /><br />Plot, storyline, acting are all substandard. CGI is very well done and it alone gets the 3 stars. I really wish the movie was better because I love SciFi.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I showed this movie to high school kids after their finals were complete.  It moved pretty slowly for them, but they like the story and sense of history.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I am glad I found this new author. I love action/thriller novels. I will definitely be reading more of his books. It was too good to put down.
0061719544|5.0|This is a fun book and exactly what I wanted. It's an entertaining read, especially when you are familiar with Craig and his roots.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is fun to play. There are lots of places to visit and lots of items to find. There are more than your normal HOS items to find. You get rewards, you find collections, you receive energy in the form of food, and lots of quests to solve. I would recommend this game to any HOG enthusiast who is looking for a little different type of game.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The Dark Knight is the crown jewel of Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy. It is a story that is leaps and bounds ahead of average Batman Begins and not even from the planet as the garbage The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is about the same idea as Batman Begins. The idea that justice trumps vengeance. The Dark Knight takes this idea to extremes to suggest that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs. It demonstrates this idea with the main plot of Save Gotham's Soul. This is supported by an internal plot that takes place within Harvey Dent, his seeking of revenge or justice, which is irreversibly broken when the Joker kills his girlfriend Rachel. Joker's actions ruins Harvey and Rachel's chance at love and sets Dent on the path to destruction. Finally, Batman is not only the main driver of fights to save Gotham, he also sacrifices his reputation to Save Gotham's Soul. Thus, the idea that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs is demonstrated. Justice as an ideal must be protected even with Rachel's death, with Dent's false hero status, and with Batman giving up his reputation.<br /><br />It's a great story and a triumph of movie making in the age of fluff and crap. Too bad the final part of the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises turns out to be as empty as this one is full.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Excellent, my girl is really happy. Easy to install and come with a lot of beautiful details. Highly recommended. Great quality.
B009LRE040|1.0|The Dark Knight Rises is the final part of Chris Nolan's Batman Trilogy. It is also certainly the worst of the three, behind the average Batman Begins and the fantastic The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is about the idea that determination leads to triumph over evil. It tries to demonstrate this idea with the main external plot of Save Gotham. This plot is supported by two others. The first is Batman's redemption and Reputation and the second is Catwoman's internal moral compass.<br /><br />The problem for me was that I can find no more than one significant turning point on each of these three plots. On the main plot. Bane goes from triumph to triumph as he enslaves Gotham with no disruption until the end. Similarly, on the Batman Reputation front, it is in the trash until he saves the city at the end. Finally, Catwoman is morally corrupt and betrays Batman ... until the end when she and the whole story turns around on one blazing action packed sequence. Somehow these few dramatic bits are supposed to fill a 2+ hour story. They don't. And the pictorial depiction of Bane's triumph is boring, boring, and boring. For solace, I guess we could always rewatch The Dark Knight.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Up until five minutes ago I would have give this game four stars, that is until it said I had to update and wiped out my entire game after getting to level thirty nine.  I cannot even open the game now.  It continues to say go to app store to update and when I do, sends me back to the screen that says update game.  I cannot begin to express how mad I am, to have a game erased after getting so far is enough to make me want to give this game zero stars but since that is not possible it gets one.  FIX THE GAME, OR DON'T BOTHER CREATING APPS THAT WON'T WORK!  Complete waste of time.
B001IYVUEW|3.0|Batman Begins is about the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance. It is the second best of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (behind The Dark Knight and ahead of The Dark Knight Rises). And you can see why with the story chart.<br /><br />Batman Begins goes about demonstrating the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance with three plots. The main external plot is of course, Save Gotham. This is augmented with a love story between Bruce and Rachel and an internal struggle of Bruce to seek revenge or justice.<br /><br />The problem is the internal plot ends in the first act. He chooses justice when he leaves the League of Shadows and his internal compass never again wavers. The love plot ends ambiguously at the end, even though he has chosen the path of the straight and narrow and defeated the revenge-seeking League of Shadows. So for the majority of the movie all we get to watch is Batman saving Gotham, and that can get boring pretty quickly. For a more interesting take on this idea, you will have to see the next in the trilogy, the epic Dark Knight.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|PRODUCTION: 5/8<br />VOCALS: 4/8<br />EXECUTION: 6/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 4/8<br /><br />GRADE: C+<br /><br />I applaud the execution but Kanye's performance is average at best and I'm generally not a fan of the minimalist production style.  The production is one of the stronger points though, and Blood On The Leaves is simply spectacular.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List is about the idea that good triumphs over evil. Small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. In this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the Holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich). In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.<br /><br />To give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of Schindler saving the Jews. To show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the Jews. Two other internal plots depict the morality of Schindler and Goeth. To make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. The choices Goeth and Schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good.<br /><br />This story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. This is why movies should be made. Its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. The same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Once the update became available, all I could do was go to app store click on the site  and it would tell me the update was available and to go to the app store again and start the cycle all over again. The game is enjoyable but can't get to the game anymore.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A little slow but it's written very well and it is even more exciting than the first. A good read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's like a very civil version of Game of Thrones, where the people you care about most die tragically and the jerks live forever. WATCH IT<br />ONE OF US, ONE OF US, ONE OF US
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Tagline above says it all. Gaiman is a skillful writer and has plenty of imagination, but this one which afaik wasn't billed as a children's story had much of the flavor of one. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but we won't be talking about it for years to come as we do with some of his earlier work, especially Smoke and Mirrors.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I loved it. great movie. after along time we show a great movie. highly recommended. I loved it. great movie. after along time we show a great movie. highly recommended.
080701429X|5.0|A powerful book.  Tired of shallow psychobabble?  Try this, and you won't be disappointed.  Viktor Frankl is a heavyweight.  I wish I had read this 30 years ago.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I really like how the writer at times gave away who the Tourist was and then at the end you are blown away to find out that the Tourist was not who you thought it was.... VERY GOOD
B0011UBDTK|5.0|For those 90 dollars I have recieved a good tool for learning the real American language.<br />Hopefully that next time I will buy something like this.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I think the game is one of the best Amazon apps because its not a con and plus there isn't to many things wrong with it but I think it is good and for people who gave bad ratings for it won't load or its reseting the game don't complain about that it's stupid the kindle fire isn't focusing on games the reason the kindle was made is so people can read not play games
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have missed this app since switching from an Adroid phone to an iPhone.  Once I bought my Kindle, the Jorte app was my first download.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|One of the classic war stories. Don't know how many times I have watched it. I lived in this era also.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Absolutely one of the best reads I have ever had.Makes me proud to have been a member of one of the greatest fraternities ever, aviator.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I happen to know the author ...but that is not why I enjoyed this book as I did.  The &#34;storyline&#34;, if you want to call it that, kept me reading ...when I should have been doing other things!  I came away with a new and better understanding of what life would have been like during the 1930's.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Although I rarely read fantasy books this story is a good one. An easy read that will take you away to different place.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|if an update is available. don't make it mandatory. I cant update because it isn't available. I cant play until I update. not happy.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|With Battery Pro it is much easier to know how much time I have on the kindle.  I am glad I downloaded it when it was free.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|The cast in this drama is exceptional! The first episode leaves you hooked and wanting to watch the entire season from start to finish!<br /><br />I missed the first episode when it aired on BBC America, but I'm so glad I found it here! Be prepared to add another TV show to your DVR line-up!
B009GJ870Q|4.0|The book is fun, nicely paced.  Deteiled but not excesively, gives you a good idea of the surroundings and is focused on the dialogue and politics of the mafia.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This is a Very well directed documentary about way more than just good sushi, but also cultural traditions, family, business, and values.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first book is great, second soso and the third I just read it because I had already bought the thrilogy,
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Pages with the F word should not be allowed.  there are other words that can be used.<br /><br />Is supposed to be a social network..... Not a soap opera
B00D5CENXA|4.0|This was a fast paced, right to the heart of it, short story. Annie was brave and strong. Her characteristics made her a great leading character. I definitely enjoyed it.
B000FVE3BG|3.0|Watch stops .....not happy with it, yiu have to keep watching the seconds. Looks is great, material is great too
B00B2166BS|5.0|The product works great and the cord is long enough for my usage.  Had a small problem with the delivery but the accessorygeeks (supplier) was right on top of it.  They answered my emails promptly and politely, and my product is now here. Thank you
B000FBFN1U|5.0|that is some bloody crazy magic.<br />i want more of this as soon as possible. the epilogue just wow.<br />just wow.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put it down and I couldn't guess what would happen next.  Orson Scott Card  is a genius.  That's why he was able to depict a genius in his story.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Still playing around with it, figuring everything out.  Not nearly as many videos as YouTube, it gets to the bottom of the page and just keeps saying loading and never loads more videos.  However I still enjoy it on my kindle hd since now you need Adobe to watch most YouTube videos
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is an awesome game it's definitely a good game for the fact that u have to come back to it over time and do dif things. This is one of the best games I've played
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Love the game, especially the fact that things don't wither and die, which means no time restraints. Only downfall I have seen is when you visit neighbors I can not go home. Have to back all the way out and restart game. I play on kindle fire and is a lot of fun! Please add me as a neighbor DSEPLJB
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It takes a little time to load sometimes. But other than that it's a great game. I don't understand the banana.
140053271X|4.0|This is really cool e-book.<br />The text is better to read if sun is brighter.<br />-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook<br />-Linux inside - lucky outside.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|A little slow at getting started, but once into it  it's quite really a good movie. It's truly amazing the relationship developed between man and beast.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I cant tell you how good this product is as it doesnt work. I ordered it to be delivered to Australia and now it has arrived and doesnt work in this country!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle App; it works very well with my Android. I may buy a Kindle in the near future. I love as I can book mark the page I was last on and get right back to it when I am ready to read.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It says I need to update? Go to app store?? I do ....and nothing! Goes back to the same screen,,! Help !
1400069742|5.0|I've read several of Lynne Olson's books and enjoyed them all.  All were focused on World War II, often primarily on the events leading up to the war.  This is the first one I've read by her that almost entirely takes place in the US, so it was particularly interesting to get a new vantage point.<br /><br />Like all of Olson's books, it's a page-turner.  Fascinating facts and personalities, so many things I didn't know even though I've read quite a bit on this period.  I probably drove my wife crazy with how often I would say to her, \\"Wow -- you have to hear this!\\"<br /><br />The other thing I really like about Olson's books is that she doesn't sell books by pitching to some low common denominator.  She's very serious, thoughtful, and thought-provoking.<br /><br />I recommend this book very highly.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was an amazing book that I couldn't keep my hands off of. I've read it multiple times now and it's still just as great. James Dashner is wonderful at keeping an audience entertained and intrigued.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps for my kindle fire, if not the most fave. I always wanted a nature sounds CD/alarm clock/something. This fits the bill without another unnecessary gadget to take up space. Very cool that I can combine multiple sounds,adjust the volume of each. I'm pleased as punch, etc. If anything I'd enjoy if the sounds had a longer loop...I don't always zonk right of to sleep and the repetition of the music can get old.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Couldn't even get the game loaded. It totally froze my Kindle Fire. I tried loading several times, same results.  Bummer.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Humorous, decent performances from a fine collection of actors - nothing too deep or thought provoking.  Good rental. Not one for the vault but certainly entertaining.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I've just finished watching Castle Season4 on my tv from my amazon video library.<br /><br />Now that I'm buying and watching the seasons of Castle all again I am enjoying the second time around more.<br /><br />I just love this tv show! I've been watching since the beginning on tv. Castle has good writers and the chemistry between all the main players is excellent and believable!
B007ZMD14I|5.0|This album was a pleasant surprise.  I liked it much better than the last one.  Myles Kennedy is a great singer.  There isn't a single song I don't like.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game!!! It's so much fun and the graphics are awesome. Two problems one is that the characters have really high coin prices and there are ads.  annoyed but enjoying temple run 2.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is a fantastic documentary on Sound City Recording Studio.  Directed by Dave Grohl from Nirvana and Foo Fighters who bought the Neve Mixing Board from Sound City.  It is amazing the artists and albums that came out of this studio and recorded through that old analog board.  It's a great peek at the inside of the music world and what the \\"feel\\" of a room can do for recording sessions.  Great film on a really neat place that unfortunately is now closed.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent! Very hot! The book is an easy read. Keeps you entertained & wanting to read more about these two characters!
B004XCUEU2|5.0|Excellent dvd. Connects with Dave and the band. Makes you appreciate the band's music even more for all the effort they put in the songs.
B0009S2T0M|1.0|It's like The Count of Monte Cristo except the revenge is not exacted equally... it drags you to the end and then disappoint and anger ensue...
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|david is hot, i can't get enough of this show. I have a lot of catching up to do season 5 and 6!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I really like it because it wakes me up easily and that's what i like it makes me wake up for school and be able to start my day
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a fun way to have despicable me 2 in your pocket. this app is a combination of subway surfur and temple run but a lot more fun!!! get this app or else you are missing out!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Beautifully filmed cinematic treasure. Lovely main character with a genuine and beguiling nature, who takes matters into her own hands to bring love and meaning into her own life and those around her in a delightful way.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This was a meticulously researched biography of Jesus and the turbulent times into which he was born. It is a well-constructed narrative that defines the Romans, the Jews, and the early Christians in terms of how they interacted with each other, worts and all.
B006RXQ62U|5.0|Loved it when it came out, love it even more now when I can press &#34;rewind&#34; and play the musical numbers again and again. Woke up singing &#34;Nowadays&#34; the morning after we rented it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I made the mistake of readung THe Hit first so it kind of ruined some of the suspense The Innocent tries to build
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The story is well written, but at times moves too quickly. I find the members of this family have  more than their share of tragic  events, but life was harder back then. All in all its a wonderful story with superb actors.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Wow, what a great read, it started a little slow but when it got going I could not put it down. So different to anything else I have read and I have been raving about it to anyone that will listen.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Look at all the references to Pilgrim's Progress! And the lives of the four March girls are told so beautifully- they are round, real, believable characters with depth. Another fantastic classic!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It's free and works what more can u ask for I also like the scientific aspect of this app very nice indeed
B0064MGU98|4.0|I find this curious. I gave the movie some stars, and now I am required to write a review. Why is it that you do not use this same system on your books program? I am an author on your site and fixing to upload a good number of new books. I would love to see this implemented for books as well.<br /><br />Jon B Barry
B000WYCF6Q|3.0|It works okay, but I have a hard time getting it to stay adjusted.  It is small, but you can see if there is a car behind you and that is what I wanted. The image in the mirror isn't going to be great, but like I said you can see if a car is behind you if that is all you want.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I can't play it ! It keeps sending me back and forth from the game and store saying I can get new updates! Very frustrating is all I can say.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Most importante to me was the chance of assesssing lots of books (especially technical) without having to suffer with the weight!
B00130UFY2|5.0|Really great for the end of this trilogy, have not been disappointed yet by mr Damon and anything he chooses to act in.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Got this app as the free app of the day.  Nice features and easy to use, however the edited images don't save.  Checked every file and nothing is found.<br /><br />Will in install...
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I never have a hard time getting through Mr. Gaiman's works.  This was no exception.  It is more of a novella, though,  Nothing as substantial as American Gods, or even The Graveyard Book.  Glad to have made its acquaintance.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing it. I have it on my computer, my phone and my kindle. It is great when you are trying to kill time.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This game is fun until it freezes or just decides that &quot;the game is no longer available&quot; and in either case, steals your coins and doesn't give them back.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this. It is challenging. I have this app on my phone and my kindle so I can play it when I have down time
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander gives a great gift to all who are experiencing the grief of the loss of a loved one.  In addition, he is opening new avenues to one's ability to grow his or her faith in the midst of overwhelming grief.  He is evidence that God reveals His presence through extraordinary representatives.  This is a must read!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The author keeps one reading so that one can understand the &#34;hero's&#34; mindset, disappointing because it ends after getting tedious with no solution unless that is revealed in the next two volumes! Not interested in ploughing through a further two volumes to find out the answer.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|It does not move as it should...I am thinking it once you set stylus on jewel it should swipe in the direction you move it but it does not do that all the time..which waste seconds in the game...it is frustrating to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game my sister loves it to it is awsome i love the comptisons i love love love it
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Great characters who we feel we've met many times before, and a satisfying tale worthy of multiple reading sessions.  Not as perfectly written or as poetic as his later masterpiece The Graveyard Book, this is still an exhilarating ride through middle America with fantastic beings.  It affected my dreams for days!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The first few minutes about the crash promise a great thriller, but the story doesn't make much sense. It drags a lot,
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I watched the movie and love it, so I had read the book and I loved the book even more.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Totally engrossing, fantastic cast. Emotionally charged. The perfect choice for serious movie night. Engaging historical drama inspires deep compassion & emotion.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I really like this movie.  Not the main story line so much as the sub characters.  I can watch the Minion banter all day.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|It was a great movie, but had a few similar scenes to Alien.  I still enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|Good flick, with an interesting twist. I don't have to watch it over and over again.  Good movie for the family.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again. The quality was very good. It was like being a kid again.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Honestly, I've never read Vonnegut and I am sort of embarrassed about it. This book is a wonderfully sarcastic look at how we take ourselves far too seriously. The protagonist of this story begins with assigning himself the task of writing a book about the \\"father of the nuclear bomb\\". His search for the story is sidetracked by lust and greed.<br />I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it to everyone. It is a very simple and easy book to read and it's meaning is easy to understand. Read this book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really like this game.you have to really think to get some of the puzzles so to escape but that's the fun. hope to see more rooms soon.
B00003BDXG|5.0|My husband and I have always loved this movie. It's a little dark for some, but there's just something about it! The characters are believable and intense. The movie flows really smoothly and even though they're criminals you just can't help but love Mickey and Mallory
B002JXK5VU|4.0|It's a very funny show, it probably needed a slightly larger budget to realize it's full potential. I say that because the regular cast appears to be fairly small and consequently the same couple of people generally solve most of the problems in the show. Give it a chance, it is a cool concept and it definitely grows on you.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, very impressed with the writing style, kept me glued to the pages.  I strongly recommend this book, and I believe it'll be one of your favorites as is mine.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first I didn't like 50 Shades and I usually don't read the \\"New craze\\" books, but my friends pestered me into reading them. I read all three on a trip to Ireland with a friend. It took me into book two before I even liked Christian and now I can't believe it's over. Well done, EL James....you took me from skeptical to doubtful to obsessed in a week.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|We saw Andrea live at the Honda Center Anaheim, we were blown away. Next thing we did was buy his latest album, Passione
B000UZNRS2|4.0|This is a good read. Need to read the previous book though to completely understand all  everthing that is happing and why.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is a good story, told in a way that makes sense. A convincing &#34;tall tale&#34;. And ofcourse I love that the norse gods are in the  center.
0345803485|1.0|Could not finish this book - forced myself to read half - but felt like I was watching a crime of rape. When an individual is \\"forced\\" into compliance - particularly for abnormal antics - how else can it be identified but rape?<br />  Normalcy is foreign to this writer - in an attempt to convince the reader that meeting an individual for the firsts time creates spasms of desire, unrealistic urges, loss of emotional control. C'mon - unless it was presented as a fairy tale.<br />  But the worst - as a reader - was the constant feeling of being disrespected (as a female), abused and tortured. No one in their right mind would \\"sign up\\" for this kind of behavior - as the writer assumes.<br />  Can hardly wait to return to an author who teaches me, uplifts my spirits and makes me feel better having read their works.  This writer debases not only my gender - but my mind. Ugh!!!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|It is overlong, and familiar, and never quite hits top gear -- it's never especially bad, but neither is it especially excellent, beyond the visual wow factor. But there's still a lot to admire in the film, not least that it's engaging from the first moment to the last. Better as a Reader!
B001J29H9I|5.0|Nothing much to say other than it is a good album from a good band, I hope they continue to do what they do best.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|We ordered the CD after seeing Bruno Mars host Saturday Night Live and perform two of the songs.  All of the songs on the CD are really good; our two favorites are the ones we saw him sing on SNL.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|Nothing much to say other than it is a good album from a good band, I hope they continue to do what they do best.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Unlike most other reviewers, I liked the album and have no problem giving it 5/5. Kanye's lyrics, or rather one liners, never disappoint.<br /><br />For instance:<br />\\"I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?\\"<br />\\"Eatin' Asian [explicit], all I need was sweet and sour sauce\\"<br />\\"300 girls, where the Trojans?\\"<br />\\"Like them black kids in Chiraq [explicit]\\"<br />\\"Star Wars fur, yeah, I'm rocking Chewbacca\\"<br />\\"When I go raw, I like to leave it in\\"<br />\\"Yeezus just rose again\\"<br />\\"One good girl is worth a thousand [explicit]\\"<br /><br />On top of Kanye's 3 edgy 5 me lyrics, the album delivers a very different sound that can be described as combination of acid house, soul, dancehall, industrial, electronica, rap, punk and drill music. It is an adventurous mix of anti-pop genres with lots of autotune.<br /><br />Kanye's use of unconventional, but interesting samples is found in this album in songs like \\"Blood On The Leaves,\\" which I thought was the best song on the album for a while.<br /><br />Where the album has lacked so far i'll admit- No cover art, Black Skinhead video bombed, only 10 songs, and perhaps a lack of big guest stars on the tracks (which goes along with it being less mainstream).<br /><br />Also, if you are hating on the song \\"I am a God, or the album title Yeezus\\" Psalm 82:6 says \\"You are \\"gods\\"; all of you are sons of the Most High.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, the song New Slaves is a great politically charged song about America's privately owned prison system making new slaves. Kanye went as far to say that the second verse of that song was the best rap verse of all time (Perhaps to bring more attention to it).<br /><br />I can see why critics have rated this album so highly.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The best book I have ever read. Hands down. Anybody and everybody can relate to this book in some way. It ranges from laugh out loud funny to bawling your eyes out.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like others my game updated now it tells me to go to the app store to get update and it won't let me play it. I'm done with this game maker and will pass along the info to everyone I know.

B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|i could not make it past the 30 minute mark and i can watch Anything. this movie is horrible , don't waste your time
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Does anyone know how to update this game I have tried everything. It keeps telling me to go to the app store to update every time I do it goes back to the game can't update
B0044C5SCU|3.0|I am a Fringe fan, but this season has me a little bored. The fringe events are kind of ho-hum and the fun between the characters is lacking since they are in a different timeline or whatever. It's no longer &#34;I have to stay up to watch more episodes&#34; like we were in seasons 1 & 2. We kind of trudged through this season.  Here's hoping Season 4 turns around!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold is back.  This isn't his best but, at least it was entertaining...It certainly kept my interest.  I hope they don't make another though....
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The lessons in this book are life changing.  It speaks to all different levels of spirituality.  I cannot recommend this book enough!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book was very informative and an excellent blueprint for how to implement Lean Startup techniques.  I am sure I will be referring back to this book over and over again as I have with Eric Reis' book.  My only nit with the book is that it has a good bit of focus on software development but I think anyone who is serious about using the techniques can put the time in to apply the principles to other types of products and services.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|As a history major at university, I couldn't get past the avoidable anachronisms the show indulged in. But if you aren't picky about erroneous details, the fighting, adventure, and soap-opera love interests ought to entertain.  I can see why the men-folk tend to like this one.  ;)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My son enjoys this app.  The music and the colors are delightful.  You have to play a while to unlock the other characters and it seems repetitive to me, but he is 3 1/2 and likes to play it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I began this book on the advice of my elder son. He was so right. It has been a captivating read. I will continue the series.
B0035S996U|5.0|What a Classic Movie. Wish they made more movies like this. Great Quote &#34; Warriros, Come out to Play&#34; .
B007W4F6M4|1.0|Maybe the movie got better.  Maybe there is a point later in the movie.  After trying to watch the first 15 to 20 minutes I finally gave up, hit the &#34;stop&#34; button with no intention of restarting later.  Watching the degrading behavior of drug addicts for a few minutes with vomiting and toilet diving was too much even for this libertarian.  Certainly this movie is not for teens/pre-teens.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|Blu-Rau version of this movie is the best (clearest) version I have ever seen. It still lacks some of the very fine detail you now expect from a Blu-Ray movie, but it is a night & day difference from any version I have seen. Most copies of this movie, even the DVD version, look like a very bad copy from a VSH tape. This Blu-Ray version is very clear, and is a must have addition to your John Wayne movie collection. You will not be disapointed in the picture quality. Enjoy
B006TKP2B2|3.0|Wow,This was by far the longest read I have done in a while! With the authors repeated use of the Thai / Tamil language, I at first thought I had purchased and downloaded a bad translation of a foreign novel. I understand the occasional use of a native term of even saying but this is too much!  The story is good, starts slow but picks up the pace and the characters are will defined. If you have patience then I would recommend this book, if you’re looking for a quick read keep looking.
0887307280|5.0|Great read, very informative and well written.  Explains things so all levels can understand with out making you feel like you aren't very smart!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett has paired himself with singers from Gosh Groban to Willie Nelson.  This has created an incredibly enjoyable and varied mural of songs and talent.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy Guy is a bluesman who's grown more masterful by the decades -- and remember, he started with Muddy Waters and Jr. Wells, so he was a top guy to begin with. Now he personifies virtuosity and vitality as well as the experience of an elder. If you dig real blues, or want to hear the best rockin' and roarin' guitar playing being done now, check out Rhythm & Blues. Buddy sings very well, too. This is great American music!
0307271080|5.0|Really good read, check it out. I recommend it because I didn't want to put it down. Read it! Read it!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I'm an avid movie collector.  I enjoy military movies and Sci-Fi movies. This one had both. Good story line and plot. Great deal at a great price!
0790729628|3.0|First of all, I am no sci-fi slouch. I love a good sci-fi flick even if it is not a huge budget blockbuster like I Robot, etc. And even though I am no sci-fi book buff, I did read Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and loved it, own the Mark Waid graphic novel adaptation of it. Having never seen this movie that was loosely based on it, I thought I was sure to enjoy this.<br /><br />Wrong. First of all, the dialogue failed in so many ways that the book succeeds - in making you sympathize with Androids wishing for autonomy and struggling to pass themselves off as human, for bounty hunter Deckard and his internal conflicts of \\"retiring\\" these rogue androids, and even the devastating effects of radiation on Earth and its cities that are marching forward into an essentially hopeless future, etc etc. It just falls flat without good dialogue or narraration.<br /><br />I can forgive the 1982 special effects of course, it was not bad for the time. I can also forgive how the trajactory of the story is different without certain elements they decided to omit altogether, like the religious of Mercerism that many adhere to and was significant in the book's storyline, the practice highlighted in the book of owning animals to preserve some humanity or avoid social stigma, etc. Overall though, for me the movie was a depressing, bleak (but without much context), and creepy attempt at honoring a fantastic sci-fi novel.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I'm an avid movie collector and I enjoy Sci-Fi movies. I got a great deal at a great price! Thanks.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I've purchased this device from google store, this device does what is says for $35 that's it. Beware... Veetle do not work, also many flash video from chrome do not work & if work it do not sync. Waste of money. Not happy with this Google product.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|I'm an avid movie collector and I enjoy Sci-Fi movies. I got a great deal at a great price! Thanks.
B000TYWAUA|3.0|Story line isn't the greatest but  well worth watching..... You won't be disappointed after watching it. Decent action action and a plot that ties it together....
B003UESJF6|5.0|I got this movie for my kiddos and they love it. I'm an avid movie collector and I always shop Amazon first. Great deal at a great price! Thanks.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game although I wish it would react faster when you had to turn fast. Although it is a very fun and addictive game.
B001HN694K|5.0|Alice In Wonderland, with Johnny Depp was a gift dvd to my roommate and we have played it numerous times!  It is such an enjoyable dvd and I highly recommend it to all ages!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Better than all the crazy reality tv shows. Great entertainment PBS! I have enjoyed seasons 1& 2 equally as much.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I don't know what I can possibly say about this book I enjoyed it so much. As far as post apocalyptic novels go I recommend this one, especially for a young adult novel just wow.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Please update to 0.7.3<br />I love this gave but it don't update fast minecraft is so fun so u should get it
B00696D0EM|4.0|I think Amazon should introduce 'half stars' or have a 1 to 10 rating; because I think this book/story rates 9/10 or 4 1/2 stars! JA is quite masterful at getting the absolute twists and sub-plots out of each his stories. A great read and I am waiting for a price reduction on Vol 3 of the Clifton Chronicles
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|5 Stars, so much better than the movie. Reading this book makes me want to read others that has been shadowed from classic movies.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Fun game till the update.  I can't update now and I can't play the game. Also it asked me if it could take space up on my kindle, like 20mbs, I don't know if that's allot but whatever!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is my favorite game to play when I have free time! It is so addicting! I play it at least once every day! Plus the minions are so adorable!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The Book Was Awsomee Anyy Thingg I Needed Too Look Uhpp Was There .... I Really Didn't Read The Entire  Book But It Was Very Useful
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I play it on my computer as well.  Now I can take it with me when I travel.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I really love this app and I hop it updates the game and I can't wait to see the game and I so excited about the game this is Amazing! Please updates the game.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed it very much. The acting and the settings were excellent. It was a very heartwarming story and presented very well.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|If you are looking for a game like SMITE or LOL this would be your best choice as far as portable games go. The graphics are great but the game is not completely free, which i expected&hellip; you could play completely free if you wish,you just won't be able to buy extras like skins. I personally love this more than LOL because this game has a few smaller details that are unique compared to any other game like this that i have played.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is very well presented. I suppose if one is an evangelical fundamentalist who insists that the Bible is the word of God and therefore infallible, one would have serious problems with the observations that Dr. Aslan presents in this well-researched, and well thought-out dissertation. If, however, one is objective I would think that it would be very thought provoking.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show with excellent writing and a great cast. You will be hooked from the first episode..  Absolutely inappropriate for younger viewers.
B00AEFXGAW|4.0|This movie has a different style of presenting its storyline but very interesting how they did. The deaf Japanese student should have won the Oscar.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Stone is controversial.  Having said that, the new information he has provided is a good addendum to The Peoples History by Zinn.  There is a lot of criticism for the style, and research quality....but, I found it informative.  You have to read ANY history with a critical eye.  The fact is that I lived in most of the eras discussed.  I even have a little bit of first-hand knowledge.  This kind of book always needs to be written if we are to call ourselves a free people.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I saw a PBS show of Hugh Laurie IN New Orleans LA. I loved it. so, I ordered the &#34;Let them Talk&#34; Cd. It was great. Laurie is a wonderful comedian, a perfect pretend doctor in House, and a great musician and performer.
B000FA675C|2.0|I had never read this author till I was in Firenze, and was told that I HAD to read the Inferno by Brown.  I enjoyed the fact that I was right in the middle of all the action, but this author is really a terrible writer!  The book is so poorly written, that only the clever topic keeps you reading.  My friend (who is a big fan) told me that the DaVinci Code was a far better book.  I felt just the opposite.  The characters were wooden, like cartoons, and the prose just awful.  Again, the story was probably great for the big screen, as the Inferno will no doubt be, but geeze.  I was appalled that it was so popular.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is one of the only books on law of attraction that did not make me feel like i must be doing something wrong with all this.  The writing is superb - so easygoing and easy to understand, and the whole thing was FUN!  And the experiments are so sneaky and brilliant in the way the get to change how you look at things. Best part - it doesn't overwhelm you with data or things you have to do - it just gently guides you shift your viewpoint to have your thoughts work for you for a change!  Been waiting for this easy do it yourself for a very long time.  Already recommended this book to anyone who will listen.  Do yourself a favor and get this.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've been pleased with my Google Chromecast so far. Set up was a breeze and took less than 5 minutes. My TV has the HDMI and USB ports right next to each other, so I use the USB port to power it rather than add another plug into my surge protector.<br /><br />The casting works excellent with Netflix and YouTube. These apps send the video right to the TV without delay and with great audio and video quality. Casting Chrome pages doesn't always work as well. To show my kids something last night I tried casting a page from Nickelodeon, whose video player wasn't YouTube. It froze at first and then only played audio. This is an area that could stand improvement.<br /><br />Another glitch it that my little girl has accidentally beamed her cartoons from Netflix on the iPad onto the main TV where my older boys are watching their shows. The boys didn't appreciate that it automatically changed the input, but they could change it right back to their input.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to taking this to hotels and using it with HDTV's and Netflix instead of the crappy in-hotel selection. It is so small it is easy to transport, and again the set-up was so simple. I wonder if a hotel's Wi-fi signal will be enough for a smooth use.<br /><br />Overall, for the price it is a great value and I'm using it so far. I hope it gains further functionality in the future.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Superb vocals with a plot to boot. Very well done and not just for the college aged viewer or pitch perfect singer.
B00A93ENX8|2.0|Was expecting this to be a multi-channel SACD release. Description should state specifically that it is not. The audio is less compressed and smoother, which is enjoyable, but still lacks the dynamic range and feel of other SACD re-releases (not to mention new SACD DSD recordings.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Perfect little amp. I only wish you could use it while it charges. That said you can get multiple batteries and the removable cover makes it easy to swap out.
B001DCZ4IW|3.0|I chose to rate this only a 3 star because it was rather slow and a bit boring.<br />I would not look to view it again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan's work is studious and extremely well-researched. He relies on many sources, including definitive Christian ones, to develop a picture of the historical Jesus and the times in which he lived.<br />His resource list and notes are as interesting to read as the bulk of the book.<br />This is not a stuffy, professorial book. Instead, it is written well, easily read and understood, and well-documented.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|What a great great album . I love the new lead singer.Queensryche is back and rocking without Jeff Tate. If you like old queensryche you will love this album
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love watching Downton Abbey and don't want to stop so we watch another...we are on episode 6 in just 3 days
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife subscribed to Amazon Prime just so she can watch Downton Abbey. She told me about it and asked if I wanted to watch, and I was skeptical at first (I wasn't too keen on Masterpiece Theater and watching a bunch of snooty, high-society Brits talk about their gazillions and lavish lifestyles if you know what I mean).<br /><br />You gotta watch it! It has everything...suspense, drama, comedy; and the dialogue is quite witty.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Every season was a homerun.  I love this series.  Did not discover it until it was already off the air, but now own all 7 seasons.  I think it should be required viewing in parenting classes!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|did the update. now it tells me I have to go to the store and get another update I push open and the game never starts. its driving me crazy I seriously played everyday. disappointing
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Just go upgrade message, but game has now quit.  On endless loop of go to store to upgrade, open .... start back to go to store.  Think it is hosed up for good this time.<br />OhiO
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I cannot get enough of this game! Several of my friends and family have downloaded the game also. They are just as crazy about it as I am.
B0053O89IS|4.0|I was wanting to complete my collection and this was it. I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|After seeing an interview with the Author I thought this was a story about how knowing the true historical Jesus vs. the &#34;christ&#34; whose stories were contained in the bible, strengthened the Authors faith. I found the actual book to be much more academic than personal.  That being said I did enjoy learning about the historical Jesus and it was refreshing to read about the facts and be left to draw ones own conclusion rather than being lead in a particular direction.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Forget the 2006 movie. This is the Phantom as it is should have been.  I was blown away by everything!
B001C5ZR1E|5.0|i got this for my dad who loves the album (he has for years but his old copy was screwed up)<br />this one plays flawlessly and it go there right when amazon said it would<br />they delivered it just in time for his birthday<br /><br />the box it came in was thick and had to open but it protected the fragile disk which is most  important
B004H83IM8|3.0|3 discs would have been better,quality seems off on video also<br />I guess for 9 bucks I should be happy ?
B008602KQI|5.0|waiting to see the next part. whts the old guy going to do ? it feels great to show someone up.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I received the Seiko Men's SNA411 Flight Alarm Chronograph Watch within 5 days of ordering it (via FedEx).  The watch came in a Seiko box with protective wrappings on the band.  I tested all the functions and all appear to work properly.  It is a rather elegant-looking watch, about the right weight and fit my wrist after taking out only one link. I had spent quite a bit of time reading reviews on this and other watches.  I found a few disgruntled reviews, but a far as I can see this is a superb watch that will serve me for a very long time.  I had Seiko chronograph which I had purchased in hurry at the Air Force PX in Rota, Spain on my way to Bahrain / Saudi Arabia / Kuwait in 1990. The darn thing made it all the way through the war and kept on ticking. Alas, I lost it during a soccer game back state side few years later. So it is quite a treat to have something of quality from Seiko again. Thanks.
B00D3LA71K|4.0|Not as good as Lincoln Lawyer but worth a look. An interesting plot line, made for Matt, good acting...Yeah!<br />He is always good.
B00DURILJ2|3.0|Thin plot.  Thinner acting.  Young boys are stars; real actors. Reese Witherspoon's fall from grace... as a character and as an actress.  Save your money and time.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Well worth a look, a good movie about his making of Psyco and what he had to go through to get it made.
B005XT4932|5.0|I'm going to date myself, but I burned through about three cassette copies of this during college.  I then actually wore out a CD.  Glad to finally have this in digital form.  One of my favorite movies, and favorite soundtracks, of all time.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|A real feel good story! A must read for cat lovers.<br />A tale of redemption and the overcoming of all odds.

B005F9TQ9C|1.0|I was 18 when I bought Dylan's \\"SelfPortrait,\\" and I am still angry to this day. It was so bad that I couldn't understand what happened. Way back then, someone told me that he had a contract dispute with his record company and owed them 70 songs; so he just wrote down a bunch of crap to satisfy the contract. Millions of devoted fans bought that collection of crap. Nice going, Bob. I have since forgiven him, but the loss of all that money I spent still hurts. \\"No Direction Home\\" made up for it. I now understand, but you hurt your fans. If not for you? No. If not for them...?????<br />I don't know why it is still on the market. Take it off, Bob.
0545586178|4.0|Hunger Games is an amazing story unto itself. i can see the overall arch of the series but it's hard to match the first book. and there came a point where (without spoilers) i thought, &#34;really? again with this?&#34; but it sets up the third pretty nicely. lot's to figure out and see what happens next

0007350007|4.0|the set up and first half of the book are obvious chricton. the story is fast paced. each chapter ends on a note that forces you to have to keep reading. and fantastical events, technologies, and environments are made to seem as real and believable as sittng in your living room watching tv. then it took a turn. i'm not sure where but by the end i really felt a sense of \\"let's wrap this sucker up and send it to publish\\" then i learned that the ending was written by another author based on Chrichtons first half of the unfinished story. aha! it all snapped into focus. still, it was a good read and enjoyable.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Of all the books I've ever read, especially science fiction, this one has always, and still remains my favorite. This is the fifth time I've read \\"Ender's Game\\" and the first I've read it on an ereader. Every read has been as enjoyable as the last and every time I've pulled away with another message to identify with in some way.<br /><br />All in all, this is not the most complex story ever written, but it has always been soulful and well crafted. I really enjoyed this book and hopefully in the next year or two I will again.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking for their next read.

B00CEF014E|5.0|As I came to the end of this story, I realized that I had been holding my breath.  I took several deep breaths.  This story will do this to you, too.  It's a story that is chilling and intense, and you'll never know what will happen next.  So let's begin at the beginning.  Dana Barnes is 26 years old, living in Los Angeles.  She's had bouts with depression and her therapist suggests she stay at the Expedition House, a psychiatric facility for five days to get a quick-start to erase her depression.  Dana had been diagnosed two years earlier as being bipolar.  But at the facility they treated her as though she was suicidal.  After the five-day internment, she is driven toward Oklahoma by Tyler, who she considers her boyfriend.  Her sister, Zoe, lives in an isolated area at an experimental environmental community called 'Rainbow.'  Zoe is married to the founder, Clive.  Enroute, during a terrible storm, they stop at an outdated motel for the night.  The Motel Americana ... well, you'll soon think of it as the Bates Motel.  When she awakens, there is no trace of Tyler other than his belongings, wallet, and keys.  What has happened to him? The local police feel he just walked away from her ... or, maybe she was delusional about him even being with her. Soon, she decides she best complete her trip to 'Rainbow.' She should have followed her instincts and driven back to Los Angeles.  This story is an extremely well written spooky story! At first it reminded me of the chill of reading years ago John Fowles thriller, \\"The Collector.\\" This, too,  is a haunting story you will read non-stop.  The pace grows more vigorous by the page, the plot is excellent with many twists and turns that will shock you.  If you like thrillers, you will love this story; I did!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is a story I grew up on, our children loved, and this copy was purchased for our first grandchild, due in October of this year.  Stories like this are timeless and children will always love the story, as well as the parents and grandparents that sit with them to watch and laugh along.
B00A3XQVKW|2.0|Just awful!  All the religious mumbo-jumbo turned me off completely!  Plus, so many typographical errors - VERY distracting!  I don't know what I was expecting - a &#34;near death experience&#34; tale without all the religious stuff being crammed down my throat.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B004GJVI5C|4.0|Pretty good story and acting.  Blake Lively actually gives the best performance, followed by Jeremy Renner (not a big favorite of mine), but knowing that they both had to learn the accent and &#34;street&#34; ways they portray in the movie to the point they're so believable actually turned me around and made me a fan of both.  Ben Affleck always does a pretty good job but the other two impressed me where they hadn't really before and the use of relative unknowns was a welcome surprise.  Definitely a good movie for Movie Night at home.  Just not with the kids...
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Great movie! Great story on the origins of the characters. Loved it! Can't wait for the sequel! Hope it's as good as this one.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|My son loved this when he was a toddler and I just purchased this one for his first child (a son due October of this year).  It's a timeless classic that has enthralled all of my neices and nephews as well as my own children.

B009YN2M7S|3.0|This book was along the same lines as the rest of Nicholas Sparks, so you should know what you are getting in to.  Nice for an easy listen for this daily commuter.  The movie adaptation was awful, don't waste your time or money.
B0037VNX44|5.0|This movie really pushes the limits when it comes to the depth of acting ability and Tom Hardy does not disappoint.  This is by far his best movie and he brings the character right off of the screen.  From drug-induced lethargy to manic insanity, Hardy embodies the full range of human emotion and is quite terrifying when you realize that this character is based on a true story.  Hard to watch at times because of its gritty reality, this is a brilliant film.

B00E00OGE2|4.0|Seeing the trailer for `Turbo' a few months back I was rather determined that this was going to be one of those films I skipped entirely.  Then my girls caught wind up it and begged and pleaded and I thought, I'll rent it.  Then the film was released and they begged some more and I said \\"let your grandma take you\\" but for some reason I wound up sitting in a theater last night waiting for what I only assumed was going to be `Cars' with snails.<br /><br />`Turbo' is far from a truly intelligent or unique film, and yet it manages to be not only fun and engaging but charming to a point where I found myself completely entwined in the story and the characters.  The tried and true themes of `dreaming big' are not something new or untold with animated films.  Animated films, which are manufactured for children, are there to inspire confidence and help them to realize that they can do anything they set their mind to.  That is why in animated films, rats can cook, wimps can train dragons and snails can race cars.  Impossibilities exaggerate truths for kids and help them to `dream big', which is something we want for all of our kids.  Like I said, this is nothing new, and `Turbo' doesn't really even attempt to make it new, but it does handle its themes and premise with spunk and charm.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Theo, a worker snail who harvest tomatoes in a garden but watches Nascar at night, dreaming of one day being a racer.  The huge obstacle being that he is a snail and thus VERY slow.  Still, this and the fact that his antics cause turmoil within his social circle and ridicule from his fellow workers does not stop him from thinking outside of the box, and when a freak accident leaves everything in his slug-juice, Theo (aka Turbo) finally sees a light at the end of the tunnel.  When a down and out taco shop owner snatches up Theo and his brother for some snail racing his powers wow this small community and soon Theo finds himself racing in the Indie 500.<br /><br />I'll say this; I'm really happy that films like this, `Monsters University' and `The Croods' have developed stories with no true antagonist other than life's obstacles and so we aren't force feeding our children more and more stories about evil people doing evil things.  The chief antagonist in `Turbo' is the mere fact that Theo is a snail, with a fame hungry racecar driver playing a minor obstacle in the end.  There is no evil snail trying to kill him.  Sure, there is some `Sid-like' kid that lives across the street who likes to crush snails on his bike, but he's not evil but merely a toddler and it's played up for comic relief.<br /><br />Speaking of comic relief, `Turbo' is genuinely funny.  The voice work from the cast is great, with Oscar nominees Paul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Jenkins spouting off alongside SNL alumni Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph with Snoop Dogg, Michael Pena, Michelle Rodriguez and Ken Jeong lending their talents as well.  Everyone hits their notes and makes a unified ensemble.  The sight gags (especially with the crows) are hilarious, and the use of music is rather inspired.  That spoof on the viral sensation of `I ain't got time for that' was one of the highlights of my movie year so far!<br /><br />So, with a surprised spirit I say \\"GO SEE TURBO!!!\\"<br />I'll say this; I'm really happy that films like this, `Monsters University' and `The Croods' have developed stories with no true antagonist other than life's obstacles and so we aren't force feeding our children more and more stories about evil people doing evil things.

B00CHVJODE|4.0|`The Croods' tells a primitive story (in more than one sense) or a family of cavemen who are thrust from the normality of their lives (and by normal, I mean abnormal routine) into a world of the unknown when their cave is destroyed during `The End'.  The family consists of a caring mother, a dopey son, a savage baby daughter, a gross grandmother, a curious teenage girl name Eep and an overprotective father, Grug.  We are introduced to the family as they hunt for food (in the most comical of manners) and are rushed back into their cave, where they spend most of their days and nights, by the threat of anything new.  When Eep ventures off one night and meets another human, the family's life is forever changed and they begin to `live'.<br /><br />As a whole, I rather enjoyed this.  It was pretty funny from start to finish, which is a plus with child centered animated films.  One thing that my daughter mentioned, and that I thought was pretty interesting, was that there is no villain here.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the film.  I'm so tired of these animated films with vicious enemies who fight against good until the death.  Why are we teaching these kinds of things to our children?  Breaking the mold, `The Croods' has the elements (and some wildlife) as the only enemy and eventually uses those very things for good.  Even Grug's constant rambling about certain death is played up for laughs.  The development of character is a tad formulaic and yet it really works as a whole.<br /><br />I do take issue with some lazy aspects of the film.  The stereotyping of the caveman himself was somewhat lazy, especially when you have this massive caveman who, as he points out, eats maybe a drip of egg a week.  He should have been skrawney and malnourished but he was unbelievably strong and quite fat.  The treatment of days was also kind of bizarre.  The family would wake up and find and egg and next thing you know it is nighttime and they are racing to hide from some kind of predator.  The conceptualized prehistoric era was fun, if not a tad `Avatar' like, and it certainly popped, so that was nice.<br /><br />In the end I give it a B-.  My family enjoyed this.  Oh, and this was easily Nicolas Cage's finest performance in a decade or two.tor.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|At the heart of `Mud' is a coming of age tale about adolescence, innocence and love.  This was surprising to me, and quite moving to be honest.  I didn't expect something so honest and `simple' to come from a film seemingly so much darker.  That isn't to say that `Mud' doesn't have thrilling elements, and it certainly reaches levels of darkness, but at its core it is something softer, kinder and more delicate.<br /><br />It is richer than I expected.<br /><br />`Mud' tells the story of fourteen year-old Ellis, a young boy living on a river in Arkansas.  His family is riddled with turmoil as his parents fight in the open air and make plans to separate.  Ellis and his friend Neckbone escape their homelives by venturing down river to a small island where Neckbone found a boat in a tree that the two plan to use as a clubhouse of sorts.  The problem is that the boat is occupied by a strange man named Mud who is awaiting the arrival of his girlfriend, Juniper.  He cannot leave the island, for reasons he leaves a mystery, but strikes a friendship with the boys, who agree to bring him food in exchange for the boat.<br /><br />While the main draw to the film is of course the mystery surrounding Mud's backstory, and don't get me wrong because it certainly is exciting and worth sticking around for, the real soul of the film comes from the development of Ellis and the unveiling of his emotional development.  As Ellis reflects on his homelife, his parent's marriage and the threat to lose his home, the girl he thinks he loves and the realization that love is not as easy as you want it to be, and then having him live vicariously through Mud, soaking in his stories and falling in love with his charm and the ideals he represents, he become drawn to Ellis and completely enwrapped in his tale.  While Mud's story may be the flashy central point in the story, it is Ellis's tale that haunts us long after the credits have finished rolling.<br /><br />I'm excited for where Jeff Nichols' career is going to lead him.  I have yet to see `Shotgun Stories', but both `Mud' and `Take Shelter' are remarkable films that show so much unique vision and potential for greatness.  I see a masterpiece in his near future.  `Mud' is through provoking and atmospheric, using the river and the light to create such charged appeal.  Even the running length feels organic thanks to the way that Nichols worked out every detail.<br /><br />I would like to take a second to address Hollywood's ridiculous bias against young male actors.  All this attention on Matthew McConaughey's career revival and his performance here being a `career best' (he's very good, surprisingly) only masks the fact that this film is not his.  Mud, while a title character, is a supporting one.  This is purely Ellis's story, and young Tye Sheridan carries this film with such authentic grace.  In fact, both he and Jacob Lofland are better than McConaughey here.  If Ellis had been a female and had been played by someone like Hailee Steinfeld then you can bet your bottom dollar someone would be trying to push for a category fraud campaign to get her a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.  Sadly, no one will do that for Sheridan, despite the fact that his performance is achingly effective.  He handles everything with such natural enlightenment.  You can feel him embrace Mud with a sense of adolescent wonderment, capitalizing on Ellis's innocence and naivety and yet as he discovers the nasty truth regarding love and life he begins to melt away and become hardened.  Contrasting his father's jilted views with Mud's fantastical coloring to strike an accurate balance is beautifully played and honestly felt.<br /><br />It's just a beautifully honed performance.reer is going to lead him.

B004KPX4W2|4.0|RED is a silly but very fun movie. The cast and premise of this film are great. Malkovich, Willis, Mirren , Freeman and Mary Louise Parker ? Looks like they all had a great time during this project. Brain Cox makes an appearance as the Soviet bad guy with a heart of gold.<br /><br />Well worth watching
B008JFUPOY|4.0|From the initial teaser trailer, I was hooked.  Sure, the idea of revisiting all of these golden Pixar ideas and not necessarily giving us anything `new' seemed a tad boring, but `Monsters Inc.' was such a delightful film and the idea of sharing more time with Sully and Mike was something I looked forward to.  A prequel showing us how this dynamic duo started seemed promising, and from a purely entertainment standpoint, it was.  Sadly, the lack of originality truly surprised me and caused my adoration for the film itself to wane upon reflection.<br /><br />The first thing of note is that `Monsters University' is rather hilarious.  There is no avoiding this.  Even in its most obvious places, the film attacks your funny bone from almost every angle.  The dialog is sharp, the one-liners are effective and the physical comedy is spot on.  I was actually kind of shocked by this, considering that early word on the film was lackluster, and the idea of Dan Scanlon, the guy who wrote `Cars' (Pixar's weakest link by a LARGE margin), was the one who wrote and directed this caused a lot of concern.  But, where the laughs are consistent, the development of story is lazy and that can be attributed to Scanlon's lack of experience and skill.<br /><br />`Monsters University' plays out like a crossbreed of `The Hunger Games' and `The House Bunny'.  I know that sounds like a really odd mash up, and this film does not contain Playmates and teenage genocide, but conceptually it felt so generic in its laziness that pulling really any random `college' movie and or `competition' vehicle would be appropriate.  There just isn't enough individual personality to make this film work as a complete unit.<br /><br />The cast of characters are fun.  Individual scenes are hilarious (the sea urchin obstacle course scene had me in stitches) and some of the moments were really memorable (that final scare scene was something else), and while I was overjoyed to hear Helen Mirren's voice come out of Dean Hardscrabble's mouth (am I the only one who felt the classroom scenes felt very `Harry Potter') I just wish that this film were something better.  Crystal and Goodman are in top form and are really made for this kind of stuff, and the development of their friendship, while completely generic, feels genuine in the finale.  I just wish that the obviousness of the plot wasn't there.  The idea that a group of misfits who are looked down on by everyone, including the teachers, have to pull themselves together, work together, get over their differences and eventually rise above and earn respect is just so `been there done that' and yet, what else could they have done?<br /><br />Have we really exhausted all originality?<br /><br />At the end of the day, I give this a B+.  It deserves that.  Pixar has such a lush and exciting way about stringing us along, and they don't truly disappoint here, even if they don't truly inspire either.ardscrabble's mouth (am I the only one who felt the classroom scenes felt very `Harry Potter') I just wish that this film were something better.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Each book in this series progressively becomes less focused and more chaotic. Conclusions to any of the hundreds of plots is not forthcoming. Unless you enjoy being strung along just so you'll purchase the next book, don't waste you time with this.<br />Rose
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I've never considered myself a Trekkie.  In fact, I make fun of those people.  That doesn't erase the fact that I wore Vulcan ears to school for Kindergarten show-and-tell, referred to myself as Spock for at least a year or two and told everyone to \\"live long and prosper\\".  You see, I'm one of those old school `Star Trek' fans.  I haven't seen any of the spin off shows outside of `The Next Generation' and I don't know any of the names of the countless characters that float in and out of the `Star Trek' universe.  I know the original characters, the ones that started it all, and I have seen all of their movies (not all of their shows).  I may not have seen them since my childhood, but the memories are all there.  So, while I don't consider myself a Trekkie and while I shamelessly laugh at those who can speak Klingon and who can name all of the alien races and actually hold full conversations of which alien race they'd like to part of (yes, I know some people like this), I hold a very special place in my heart for Captain Kirk and Spock and the rest of the crew of the Starship Enterprise because they were such a special part of my childhood.<br /><br />Back in 2009, J.J. Abrams unleashed a whole new look at these characters with his Blockbuster rebirth of the popular franchise.  I was wholly excited to see these characters brought back to life on the big screen for a new generation.  In a way, it felt like coming home.  Finally I could feel alright about letting this particular universe back into my life.<br /><br />It felt acceptable.<br /><br />For me, `Star Trek' was one of the highlights of 2009.  With a rich cast (that ensemble is phenomenal) and a beautifully fleshed out storyline that took the important facets of an `origin story' and allowed to be embellished with a backstory and history that felt fresh, exciting and new, `Star Trek' exceeded my expectations.  Yes, it betrays in a way the very fundamental core of what the `Star Trek' universe was based on, tonally at least, but it made it more human and thus more accessible to today's culture and society.<br /><br />It made `Star Trek' cool again.<br /><br />With `Star Trek Into Darkness', Abrams and company continue down their slope of huge action set pieces and compelling chemistry to create another Blockbuster film that draws in the audience and keeps us at the edge of our seat awaiting the next frame.  As far as stringing us along within the scope of the genre, this newfound exploitation of science fiction and action in a way that explodes from scene to scene, Abrams still nails it.  He brings so much to the table in terms of style and visual impact that it is hard to fault that aspect of the film.  He knows how to keep you watching and enjoying what you are watching.<br /><br />Sadly, for me, `Star Trek Into Darkness' just doesn't live up to its predecessor, and when you factor in the obvious inspiration for the film (the legendary `Wrath of Kahn') you have even more to `nitpick' about.<br /><br />The question then rises is; is it really nitpicking?<br /><br />The sad thing about this new edition into the series is that it just doesn't have the same heart and soul that the first film did.  It lacks that passionate humanity that laced the original film (and `Wrath of Kahn' as well).  While the snappy dialog and the chemistry between the characters is still there (I still love this ensemble and find it borderline perfection), the backstory element that helped make the 2009 reboot so successful is lost here in favor of a sloppily structured story revolving around a familiar character (Kahn) and a not so familiar one (Marcus).  Now, one may say that the origin story is done and so they need to move on, but by keeping the development of Kahn and Marcus's backstory so skeletal it made their plight feel uneventful despite being rather `eventful'.  Worse than that, as the film tries to explain the backstory it so recklessly threw together, it becomes sadly obvious that little thought was given to plot development at all.  It makes little sense and feels only half developed.<br /><br />I also found the shameless referencing to `Wrath of Kahn' without the same depth of character and circumstance to be disheartening.  The finale concerning Spock and Kirk in a very familiar scene (swapped roles, but mirror image) has a veneer of emotion and yet it all feels so manipulative because you already know how the film is going to rectify the situation, since no one has the balls anymore to give us a downtrodden and honest ending.  Sure, in the midst of the film's intense gravitational pull I wasn't truly concerned with my emotional detachment, but upon reflection it is obvious why I nearly shrugged when leaving the theater.

It makes little sense and feels only half developed.<br /><br />I also found the shameless referencing to `Wrath of Kahn' without the same depth of character and circumstance to be disheartening.  The finale concerning Spock and Kirk in a very familiar scene (swapped roles, but mirror image) has a veneer of emotion and yet it all feels so manipulative because you already know how the film is going to rectify the situation, since no one has the balls anymore to give us a downtrodden and honest ending.  Sure, in the midst of the film's intense gravitational pull I wasn't truly concerned with my emotional detachment, but upon reflection it is obvious why I nearly shrugged when leaving the theater.

B000I9U8VO|5.0|Was a really good movie, would watch it again and let other people know it was good.  You shouldn't force people to put more words.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|`The Great Gatsby' was one of those films I really, truly wanted to love.  While not on the same level of anticipation as last years `Les Miserables', `The Great Gatsby' was extremely high on my list of films with the most potential to wow me this year.  I'm a huge fan of the novel.  Fitzgerald's most recognized work is an outstanding piece of literature, and having read it last year for the first time, it was one of those rare instances where all the hype surrounding a book represented it well.  I was blown away.  Having seen the 1974 film version years ago, I had this lingering air of disappointment resting in the back of my mind.  Coppola's Redford/Farrow helmed film was a boring mess and never really captured the magnificence or even poignancy of Fitzgerald's prose, which is shocking to be honest (you'd think that director and that cast would be aces).<br /><br />Baz Luhrmann is never boring.<br /><br />When news broke initially that Baz was going to be adapting this novel, I was nervous.  I love Luhrmann's style more than most and so I had no qualms with that aspect, but the fact that at the time all I had going on was the 1974 version (which bored me to tears) and the casting (Maguire, really?) has me thinking this was a bad idea.  Then I read the novel and became more intrigued by the prospect of Luhrmann doing for Gatsby what he did for Romeo.<br /><br />I was hooked.<br /><br />While the rest of the world cringed at every new development regarding this project (the stills, the trippy party scenes, the Jay-Z centered soundtrack, the casting of Carey Mulligan, the visual expansiveness) I was in hog-heaven; wet with anticipation.  I love the bold visual quality to Luhrmann's body of work.  No, I've never seen `Australia', but I have seen the rest of his films, and I personally consider `Romeo + Juliet' a masterpiece and consider `Moulin Rouge' close to one.  His sense of style and trashy elegance is profound and unmistakably authentic to his own vision.  He has undeniable showmanship, and while his films can become chaotic and almost trippy, he reigns in those formulas to create something inspired and endearing.  Sure, it doesn't seem like the obvious fit for Fitzgerald and yet that is what I loved so much about this project `in the making'.  It was so out of left field.  It didn't make sense, and because of that I was expecting absolute, unbridled G-R-E-A-T-N-E-S-S.<br /><br />I kind of got M-A-D-N-E-S-S instead.<br /><br />I don't want this to be a total bashing of the film, because I did not hate this, but unlike some film experiences, this did not rest better on me the more I thought about it.  The flaws here are too large to ignore, and while some flawed films make the most of their flaws over time (even those obnoxious close ups in `Les Miserables' can be argued as intimate after subsequent viewings), the more I think about `The Great Gatsby' the more uneasy I am over the overall product.  Still, there are certain aspects that deserve our attention (most notably the technical aspects and Joel Edgerton).<br /><br />I'll talk about those first.<br /><br />The film is lushly draped and a whole lot of fun to watch, from a purely visual standpoint.  Okay, the use of CGI was atrocious and made me really, really angry, but I'm talking about the clothes and sets right now.  The garments for each character were beautifully tailored and expertly crafted for each individual personality.  The use of angelic pastels for Daisy or gruff structure for Tom or silky smooth polish for Gatsby were all magnificently accurate.  The rooms, the showman's quality to each piece was jaw dropping in many respects.<br /><br />The acting, for the most part, was really well done.  Carey Mulligan, despite initial concerns, was a wonderful Daisy.  She captured her free spirit trapped by her upper crust lifestyle and her imbedded selfishness that refused to allow her to completely follow her heart.  She had this breathy, almost adolescent take on Daisy's overall `act', but she managed to flesh out those final moments with her eyes to excruciating detail.  Newcomer Elizabeth Debicki was sensationally good as Jordon Baker.  I had high hopes for this particular performance because Lois Chiles delivers my favorite performance in Coppola's film and so I love what `can' be done with this character.  Debicki did all that and then some!  She handled her alluring tension, her unashamed material point of view and her dripping sensuality while capturing the era, the vibe and the bridled chaos of the city.  For me though, Joel Edgerton takes top honors.  Not only does he hold his accent marvelously (poor DiCaprio goes in and out too much) but he also etches out every layer of Tom's emotional complexity.  When reading the novel I was enamored with how layered this man was, and he instantly became one of my favorite literary villains.  Edgerton gets it so right here.  He captures Tom's sexual presence as well as his gruff exterior, his selfish tendencies and his control issues.  The panic in his eyes when he sees his world slipping is compelling, and the tension he brings to his neck when he faces Gatsby's rage is fantastic.  That laugh, that all knowing chuckle (that shakes in its attempt to mask his fears) is flawless, and his manipulative talk is authentic to a T.<br /><br />DiCaprio is effective here, but the script doesn't help him much (I agree with those who say a drinking game on the utterances of `Old Sport' would result in alcohol poisoning) and Tobey Maguire is a mess.  His narration is awful (I hate his voice) and he really suffers at trying to bring some authenticity to his role.  It's a poorly executed performance, and I personally wish a younger and more talented actor had been cast.  The biggest disappointment for me was Isla Fisher.  I had such high hopes for this performance because I personally like her a lot and this character has so much meat, but instead she is relegated to a caricature who appears in one outlandish party scene and then, well, the car.<br /><br />But that brings me to one of my biggest qualms with the film as a whole; Luhrmann.  I never thought that this would be my issue, mainly because I championed him taking a bold approach, but his boldness feels so half-baked here.  I told my wife as we left the theater that I wished he had taken it all the way or not bothered to take it there at all.  He had so many visual ideas, but he left them half-developed.  The first thirty minutes or so of the film is a chaotic exploitation of modern ideas infiltrating times past and then he almost gives up on that amalgam altogether and tries to give things a more respectable air.  It creates a disjointed atmosphere that doesn't hold up.  The sad part is that both divisions are flawed in their execution as well, and so you can't even say that one half is better than the other.  The chaotic scenes lack the proper editing to make them feel exciting.  The party scenes drag on too long and become repetitive and feel high-school trashy, not visionary trashy.  I'm someone who considers Luhrmann an auteur and so I expected more from him.  The drier parts of the film, while never boring, feel like they were ripped from a completely different film done by a different actor.  They almost have an amateurish quality to them.  Luhrmann's grasp of the material itself just feels so rudimentary, so surface.<br /><br />He never digs deep enough, yet is contented with exploiting the obvious.<br /><br />Now, while I applaud the lavish sets and costumes, the use of CGI was an embarrassment.  I understand that he was trying to create layers, and maybe in a 3D world this has better effect (I saw this in 2D), but I feel that any 3D film better work in 2D, and this one just felt like it was trying too hard.  The CGI was distracting, especially in the creation of landscapes (the shots of the car driving into the grimy district were horribly cartoonish) and the obnoxious car rides and complete insistence on giving us everything gave me a headache.  While I find Luhrmann's use of music in all of his films to be exciting and inspired, there were moments here that felt a tad beneath him in execution.  It felt like he was a new director trying really, really hard to be relevant and ultimately coming off as a poser of sorts.<br /><br />But that Lana Del Rey song is heaven!<br /><br />So there you have it.  I'm in the middle here.  I'll see this again, and I can't say I'd not recommend it.  It has a lot to offer, but at the end of the day I feel as though this is lesser Luhrmann and ultimately feels like a step backwards for the director.  He doesn't mesh his directorial approaches well and delivers to us a beautifully draped, awkwardly paced and ultimately fragmented take on a stunning literary piece.one outlandish party scene and then, well, the car.<br /><br />But that brings me to one of my biggest qualms with the film as a whole; Luhrmann.

B00DYVUBYM|5.0|Innocence lost due to the struggling life of stardom is something that Sophia Coppola likes to explore.  Maybe it's her background, being brought up in a household that revolved around the arts and was always smothered by fame.  In fact, `Somewhere', her least well known film, is said to be an autobiography of sorts (with regards to her childhood with her father).  Yes, fame, fortune and the emptiness that comes along with it is something that Coppola has staked her career on.  From the solemn romanticism of `Lost in Translation' to the flamboyant ostracism of `Marie Antoinette' to the quiet understanding of `Somewhere', Coppola has exploited nearly every facet of fame and the disastrous effects it has on those caught up in it.<br /><br />With `The Bling Ring', Coppola moves away from the more intimate aspects of fame and dissects the dangers that that very drug has, not on those who have it by on those who want it.  One could call to mind the fascination Coppola flirted with in her very first film, `The Virgin Suicides'.  In her debut she immortalized average girls by focusing on the neighborhood boys caught up in an obsession of sorts with their very being.  Here, Coppola takes that obsession and kicks it up a few dozen notches, using the real life story of a group of kids who took their media fueled celebrity obsessions to the extreme.<br /><br />I think we've all seen the videos.  They circulated YouTube a few years back, and E! made it a point of following these girls and their stories, especially the outspoken Nicki Moore, and so when we see something like `The Bling Ring' it is easy to assume that this is nothing more than exploitation of the very thing that motivated these young women (and young man) to engage in such reckless and offensive behavior.  You are what you eat, and glamming up celebrity in this way can be seen as adding to the problem.<br /><br />Watch the trailer and keep on thinking that way if you want, but watch the movie and find something very different.<br /><br />What I love about Sophia Coppola, the director, is that she has a nuanced way of etching out so much truth in the details.  You can't help but feel the delicate manner in which she sets up her scenes, even the more fast paced and seemingly flamboyant ones.  She understands how to mold each scene so as to find something deeper below the shallow exteriors.  She's been doing this for years.  Watch `Marie Antoinette' and watch Coppola find so many shades of color in a rather straightforward storyline.  Here is no exception.  While scenes fly by with teens engaging in parties, drugs, drinking, robberies; all of which laced with this feeling of cool or `fun', one can't ignore the obvious drain of innocence and the compelling character study (personal at that) that Sophia delivers to us.<br /><br />Let's be honest.  We are obsessed, as a culture, with celebrities.  They are superior to us.  We watch them with baited breath.  We want what they wear, we eat what they eat, we fantasize about them sexually, we watch where they go, what they watch, who the listen to, who they date, where they vacation, what they feed their children, how they dress their children.  The list goes on and on and quite frankly none of us can escape it if we wanted to.  What is more disheartening is that this has trickled down into a generation of teenagers (and younger) who want nothing more than to be famous.  The Paris Hilton's and the clutter of talentless kids from shows about being rich (much like `The Hills') has bred a world full of people who feel that they don't have to contribute anything or merit to be successful and have legions of fans, and the sad truth is that they are right.  What I found so interesting about Coppola's `expos&eacute;' so-to-speak is that she didn't stop there.  No, she didn't rest at merely singling out the media obsessions that provoked these kids, but she touches upon something even darker and more disturbing.<br /><br />As young Marc mentions on the outset of the film, people today are drawn to the Bonnie and Clyde, the dangerous.  More than being famous and being rich, people are fascinated with those who break the laws that confine us.  As we meet young Rebecca we see a young woman not in want of anything and yet she is a compulsorily stealer.  She can't help it.  She checks cars, she snags purses, she breaks into empty houses and eventually she allows her clear obsession with the stars to force her into trying to attain their life, if even just for a minute.  It isn't always about the `things' but about the places.  Watch the way she can't leave Paris's house until she gets a picture using her phone.  Watch the way she ignites with glee over sharing this moment with her friends, drinking Paris's booze and trying on her clothes.  She takes delight in their knowledge of her actions, because she wasn't afraid to do the dirty and because of her they are all having fun.<br /><br />But notice how easy it was for her to shut it all off, which speaks to an almost darker truth.<br /><br />Yes, `The Bling Ring' is fun.  I smiled at the sequences and the way the film's depictions of teen rebelliousness was framed (great cinematography by the late Harris Savides) and the use of music (Coppola is a queen at that) is inspired and adds so many layers of edgy abandon to the film.  I relished in Emma Watson's glorious reenactment of Nicki's `put on' persona and I ogled the eye candy (both the bodies and the clothing) and yet leaving the theater I'm left with a deepened sadness for the state of our society as a whole.  For me, `The Bling Ring' could be this year's `The Social Network', a film that captures the state of an era, a people, a generation.  It casts light on the current pursuit of happiness, or what the media projects that happiness to be.<br /><br />While Sophia has clearly shown us that fame isn't always what it appears, she masterfully shows us that the pursuit of that said `fame' can be an even uglier, lonelier and more crippling experience altogether.n the outset of the film, people today are drawn to the Bonnie and Clyde, the dangerous.

B00BB67UNW|2.0|Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors who have a career that feels smaller than it is, mainly because all of his film roles run together.  Whether he's playing another cop, or another criminal gone good, or another arrogant Bostonian, Wahlberg seems to regurgitate the same character over and over again, film to film.  The sad thing is that, for the most part, he chooses a slew of forgettable films to grace his familiar shtick with.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, `Broken City' is no different.<br /><br />Directed by Allen Hughes, one of the Hughes Brothers who made a name for themselves back in the early 90's, `Broken City' is your standard `bad cop gone good caught in a web of lies told by even badder (I know that's not a word) men in higher places' type stories; you know, the kind that Marky Mark has made a thousand times before (or so it would seem).  In this film you have him sparring off against Russell Crowe, who plays the mayor of New York who hires former cop Wahlberg to spy on his wife, who he claims is having an affair.  If you saw the trailers for the film then you basically know the whole story already.  Zeta-Jones (the wife) isn't really having an affair, but that is just a cover story told by Crowe, who is the real bad guy here.<br /><br />Don't you hate it when trailers give away the whole plot?  This is one of those situations where I actually feel like the film itself may have been a better experience had the trailer left it at `Crowe thinks Zeta-Jones is having an affair' and cut out all the `but it's obvious that Wahlberg is being strung along and don't miss this shot of Crowe giving the camera a look that spells out the fact that he is a deceitful villain'.  I hate obviousness, and trailers cut like that take all the fun out of a film, especially since Crowe really doesn't play his part too obviously and actually strings us along rather well for the first half of the film.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to Allen Hughes.  I mean, `Menace II Society' was one of those films that took me by complete surprise and wound up being one of the highlights of the 90's for me.  This just feels so pedestrian.  There is no spark here.  Nothing is thrilling and all of the high tension moments feel ripped from other films.  How many times is there going to be a late night car chase by the river?  Seriously?  I've seen that scene before, done much better in another Russell Crowe film.  Sadly, everything about this film feels borrowed and because of that I can't recommend it at all.  It is not a bad film, it just is so forgettable.  Even the political aspect of the film felt so apathetic.  At the end of it all there is nothing to care about here.<br /><br />The acting is decent.  Wahlberg does what he does, which is the same thing he did in the last movie but we're used to it.  He is not a bad actor, he just has no range.  Zeta-Jones does nothing and pretty much could have been played by any actress.  Crowe is in fine form, but the character is such an empty shell that I wish he would have walked away from the film altogether.  He completely devours Wahlberg in their verbal sparring scenes, especially in the final one, but even that isn't enough to save the film.  The highlight here is easily Kyle Chandler, who makes so much out of a very small role.  His few scenes are the best in the film, and the naturalness is lends to his every word (that train scene is magnificent) makes for a very flowing presence.  I wanted to see more of him, but I really wouldn't have wanted him to play any other role than the one he played, since it was the best in the film.<br /><br />I wish I could give this a higher grade, but a D is really all I can muster.I Society' was one of those films that took me by complete surprise and wound up being one of the highlights of the 90's for me.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really really enjoyable.  Great graphics and nice pinch and zoom as well.  Very clear images and lots of puzzles and searching for clues.
B008JFUQZ2|3.0|`Pacific Rim' is not the type of movie I would normally be excited about seeing.  I do, on occasion, like the big budget action films, but more so than not it is when there is some nostalgia laced with it.  Superhero movies based on famous characters of my youth or reboots of franchises that I remember loving as a child; those are the special effects heavy behemoths that I generally gravitate towards.  Something like `Pacific Rim' looked, to me, like one of those geek-fest videogame movies that pop up and earn legions of devoted fans but get panned by critics and pretty much serves up forgettable explosions.  Still, some friends really wanted to see it and so they drug me to the movies last night.  I was really hesitant.  The guy at the ticket counter hadn't seen it, so he was of no help, and then in walked two middle-aged men who clearly lived with their mothers, chattering about `The Hobbit' and the upcoming `City of Bones' movie, and as I watched them walk into the `Pacific Rim' theater I was convinced that I was going to hate the next two hours of my life.<br /><br />A lot about `Pacific Rim' makes little sense, but at the end of the day this was one fun movie!<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro is not a director I'm very familiar with.  I know that he loves fantasy and videogames and he has a huge cult following, but the only film of his that I've seen is `Pan's Labyrinth' and so I'm not entirely versed in his filmography or style.  If this is any indication, he likes things big and loud.  He certainly delivered on both of those fronts.<br /><br />The story is rather simple.  Mysterious creatures called Kaiju have been terrorizing earth for years.  The humans created mind controlled gigantic robots to fight these Kaiju and got really good at it.  Everything seemed well, the men who pilot the robots (known as Jaegers) are superstars and the world seems safe from extinction, until the Kaiju smarten up and begin to find ways of defeating the Jaegers, locating their weaknesses and developing weapons.  It then becomes evident that the Jaegers are not the best defense and the government switches to building a massive wall to protect earth.  That doesn't work so well (you think?) and so they develop some plan of attack to get a bomb in the portal used by the Kaiju to attack.  In the process, we have a washed up pilot and a wannabe pilot, both with tragic backstories, fighting against an arrogant pilot and a stubborn leader as they wage war on these creatures.<br /><br />This is basically `Transformers vs. Godzilla: The Movie'.<br /><br />Like I said, a lot of this doesn't make sense, and the film is littered with serious flaws.  The lazy backstory given the Kaiju, the fact that they only have one portal they come from, the fact that these giant robots are carried to the sea by a few small helicopters, the fact that they don't use their swords until after they are ripped to pieces, the fact that one fight scene literally wipes the entire Hong Kong population off the map.  The list goes on and on.  The fact that everyone YELLS EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME or the fact that stereotypes litter everything, especially when it comes to the nerdy scientists.<br /><br />But, for all of these flaws, the film was a lot of fun from start to finish.<br /><br />The graphics here are OUTSTANDING, and I mean that.  They are the cleanest, sharpest, most graphic effects I've seen in film in a while.  From the creation of the Kaiju to the detailed Jaegers, this is some visually impressive stuff.  The first twenty minutes of the film serve as a masterful example of what `movie magic' is all about, and this is one of those films where the 3D actually works a great deal.  I also loved some of the minor touches, like how when we meet out leading lady she is concealed with an umbrella, making us think that she is some big Hollywood face, only to have her revealed as Rinko Kikuchi.  I liked that most of the cast were unknowns, or faces known more for their television work.  It took out the `movie star' and gave this more identity.<br /><br />Still, this movie can't escape being stupid.  It deliberately goes for camp in many areas, and for the most part it works, even when it doesn't, if that makes sense.  The plot holes were everywhere, but it didn't matter one bit, because I enjoyed every minute of it.ion work.

B0015AARJI|2.0|The description didn't say part of it was broken out. Was not happy at all for it to finally come and find this out..
B0043JDUNS|5.0|We love the Iron Man series.  It is entertaining for the whole family to watch this series of movies together.
B00C81LYH2|1.0|OK, I do understand that people are collecting these as display dolls, but I wanted to give this Barbie a chance to play with other Barbie dolls, under my daughter's supervision.<br />This Barbie has a very odd look on her face - my husband was alarmed when we opened the box, saying \\"it's Paris Hilton!\\" And now I can't un-see the resemblance!<br />The doll body shape is even skinnier than a normal Barbie, she is not at all poseable, her giant skirt is way to long, and the white plastic snowflakes on the dress overlay seem too fragile for play.<br />All in all, this is definitely a Barbie destined for the sidelines.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The two kids who are the main characters are excellent.  Matthew does a good job of not stealing the spotlight.  Reese does a great job playing herself as a drunk, white trash trouble maker.  I didn't have any real expectations going into it but it turned out to be an excellent film.  I think the two kids will be seen for years to come.
