B002SG8A56|4.0|People had been telling me to watch this show and I just got around to doing so.  I think that the 1st season was better than the 2nd one. Some of the music in the second season sucked in my opinion. The music in the 1st was really good.

She read the 1st 3 in a matter of 6 days & is on to the 4th so that says it all right there. You can't beat the price either. Barnes & Nobles wanted $25 for the same set so look no further than here to purchase the books.

1594481717|5.0|There is a very unique perspective on analytical thinking and leadership in these pages...<br /><br />Daniel Pink says, \\"storytelling doesn't replace analytical thinking.  It supplements it by enabling us to imagine new perspectives and new worlds.  Abstract analysis is easier to understand when seen through the lens of a well-chosen story\\" (pg 108).<br /><br />In my opinion, leadership is the right brain activity that acts as the powerful multiplier of analytical tools, and applications are the stories that act as the magnifying lens.  However, leadership is a multi-faceted and oft-misunderstood discipline, one in which the leader must always grow and continue to develop.  Leadership has, thus far, managed to avoid accurate description by any analytical model, but these models have revealed some interesting characteristics of the science of leadership.  One of the key elements of leadership is relationships.  Dan suggests that the successful, \\"whole mind\\" thinker of the twenty-first century will focus on \\"forging relationships rather than executing transactions, tackling novel challenges instead of solving routine problems, and synthesizing the big picture rather than analyzing a single component\\" (pg 40).<br /><br />Since this is a book that challenges the logical paradigms of traditional knowledge workers, I will not perform my normal analysis (the 5Ws), but I do recommend it to leaders and analytical thinkers alike.
143350393X|5.0|I have not had my ESV Study Bible for very long but I really like it.  Before I was using a NKJV Nelson Study Bible but I like the ESV better.  The text itself is easy to read though the study notes have fairly small font, about as small as I'd like to go.  I really enjoy having a study bible so I can experience the full context of the verses I am reading.  I also really like the outside of this Bible.  It is attractive and seems well bound.  My Nelson Bible was a paperback and I would have to hold it open so this is a real treat.  I also read that this is a 2009 Christian Book of the Year and that is encouraging.  I recommend this Bible.
1439181780|1.0|In between bursts of laughter which usually followed with long eye rolls I was amazed at the   amount of simpletons out there.  There is no back up documentation, no science, NO REALITY  to any of these claims.  These readers that get overly excited about this kind of material makes  me sad.  I have to assume that the reader of this type of book are the   same ones that have book shelves full of self help and are the same ones that buy every yo yo   diet there is because they are ... gullible.  I read this book basically on a dare because my  friend new it would drive me insane that anyone would write this crap - I was screaming the   whole time ... it was painful.  The author is literally laughing all the way to the bank,  she assumes that the reader is stupid ... unfortunately she is right.
0596806027|5.0|I've been trying for some time to jump onto HTML5 wagon and this book finally gave me the complete insight into this field. I was hoping to see authoritative O'Reilly approach in writing but I've found even better story to read. Mark Pilgrim's writing is easy to read with funny and witty details so it was easy to upgrade my knowledge about this most recent technology.  Technical details are very clearly arranged and will stay close to my keyboard as a great reference. Not only that but Mark explains even some extra frameworks that can help you to build your next HTML5 code with graceful degradation towards the older browsers.  This book is starting point but will surely prep you real good to become master of HTML5.
0385504225|4.0|Yay, I finished The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown!<br /><br />What a 500 page adventure this was too.  Yes, the story is a bit formulaic as it runs about the same as The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons:  Robert Langdon is called over to some place, goes through some adventure that coincidentally is helped by his extreme knowledge of symbology and occult knowledge; he meets a beautiful but unobtainable woman; and finally we resolve the issues at hand.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the concept of \\"Noetic Science\\" as Brown calls it -- the attempt to marry science and religion as, per the novel, they're attempting the same thing -- the ultimate attainment of Man as god -- \\"do you not know that ye are gods?\\"<br /><br />Peter Solomon, Mason master, brings to the 33rd level a guy plays a pivotal role in Peter's life.  In fact, he already had!<br /><br />As in past Brown novels, the bad guy is truly a nut -- but a nut with an interesting psychosis that actually could achieve his ends.  Mal'akh is his name; he had money, power and women of his choice, but relinquished his fortune for the taste of ultimate power.  A power that only Robert Langdon could afford him.<br /><br />Brown ratchets up the action with Peter's scientific sister Katherine, who has a lab that contains the Noetic science stuff.  Not really explained is why the vault it is in needs to be in total darkness.  And the constant flashbacks which turn into basically lecture notes on Masonic legends was a bit annoying.<br /><br />The whole CIA angle was well-played, though the unlikeable CIA operative Sato was a bit much.  The cigarette-smoking, tough gal who clearly had a problem with making her thoughts known and just like a grouchy parent: \\"Do as you're told!\\"  No wonder she garnered little cooperation from our crew (at first).<br /><br />Be that as it may, I really enjoyed the ending of Mal'akh, the discovery of his true identity, the near-death experience of our main character and the final discovery of The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />Despite what other reviewers say, I liked the cinematic style of the book -- this could easily be made into a film.  Tom Hanks, are you available?<br /><br />Clearly this book will rekindle some interest in the stately buildings of our nation's Capitol area as well as getting readers to check out the Bible in a new and different vision.<br /><br />Although the weakest of the Langdon trilogy (to me!), it yet was an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Other Dan Brown Books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]]<br />[[ASIN:B0032BION4 Angels & Demons (Robert Langdon) (Hardcover)]]I liked the cinematic style of the book -- this could easily be made into a film.

0316098337|5.0|What hold could Old Nick have over Ma that would make that room her world?  Why didn't she just leave? Or maybe she wasn't able to leave?<br /><br />Jack's fifth birthday definitely wouldn't be what a normal five-year-old would be delighted with, but Jack was happy to spend the day with his Ma in their ordinary, same-as-always routine.  They spent every day in the \\"room\\" with the food and clothing that Old Nick provided for them.<br /><br />Ma doesn't allow Old Nick to see Jack but she never tells Jack why.  Ma and Jack's days are creatively spent inventing things, measuring everything in the room that has been Ma's space for the past seven years, reading books and changing the characters to suit them, and watching the clock so they know when it is time to eat or sleep.  They never leave their \\"room,\\" and Jack really doesn't know any better or know anything about the outside world except what his Ma tells him when they read books.<br /><br />As much as Ma tries to protect and shelter Jack, he begins to question what is beyond the walls they live in.  Ma tries to divert Jack's attention to other things, but sometimes it is unavoidable......especially the night when Jack overheard a conversation between Ma and Old Nick about him and the life Old Nick  provides for her.<br /><br />One comment made by Old Nick that stuck in my mind was: \\"I don't think you appreciate how good you've got it here,\\" \\"Do you?\\" Page 69  To me that would be highly questionable....how good could life be simply living in a room and never going outside?<br /><br />I grew to hate Old Nick and how he treated both of them.  When you find out the \\"whole\\" story, you won't want to stop reading.<br /><br />This book is about fear, abuse, control, a mother's love, and wanting the best for your child.  At first you may want to put the book down, but don't do it....you will share Ma's feelings of fear for Old Nick and her dependence on him and also the heartbreak of Jack's acceptance of the only life he has known.  You will fall in love with sweet, innocent, literal Jack, and you will think about both characters and their experience long after you turn the last page.<br /><br />To me this was actually a \\"creative\\" thriller...excellent storyline. I really liked the book.  5/5nnocent, literal Jack, and you will think about both characters and their experience long after you turn the last page.    To me this was actually a \\"creative\\" thriller...excellent storyline. I really liked the book.   5/5

0439023513|5.0|As I turned the last page of this book-well, rather clicked the \\"next page\\" button on my E-book reader- I felt completely broken and a little surprised. Mockingjay was a stunning conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy. I think all readers should know that this journey is a very tough one. In many great peices of literature like Toni Morrison's masterpiece [[ASIN:0307264882 Beloved (Everyman's Library)]], the reader goes through a lot with the characters. I warn readers that there is heavy violence, cruelty and death woven in every page of this book.<br /><br />Despite the gore and sadness that fill the pages, there is a sense of honesty in this story. Katniss, Peeta, Gale and even Coin are all believable characters in the hell that is Panem in revolt. Classified as a teen novel, some would think that the \\"bad parts\\" would be skimmed over or left out, but Collins embraces the brutality and horror of a world that is in a post-apocalyptic state, where the human race has already reached it's breaking point and is living the adage \\"every man for himself\\" wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Although Katniss is battered and broken and challenged at every turn, she keeps going. And, that's why I kept reading. Even though she can be unlikable at times, you understand why and keep turning page after page (or clicking button after button) trying to figure out how things end up.<br /><br />This is not a story that you feel especially rewarded at the end of- there's so much going on that you're trying to figure out what just happend a few pages ago before you can process the page you're on. BUT- it is a story that you'll think about days later. The ending is something that readers may object to because it is not a victory where no one is hurt, no one dies and no one leaves with too many scars- physically and mentally. The ending is just like the rest of the book- fitting to the time, place and situation and crushing and sweet all at the same time.<br /><br />The world Collins creates feels fully fleshed out and tangible- and just a bit scary because Panem doesn't seem all that imaginary and far-fetched at times...I highly recommend it.ble- and just a bit scary because Panem doesn't seem all that imaginary and far-fetched at times...I highly recommend it.
0802130208|5.0|I came across this Pulitzer Prize winner for $3 at a used book store. The title was enough to catch my eye, as I vaguely recognized it from a Swift quote.     In the inside cover I found the [true] story behind the novel and was hooked - penned by a recluse, hidden in an attic, author committed suicide, years later mother takes manuscript to skeptical English professor who ends up publishing it, novel wins posthumous Pulitzer.     What a great book. Our hero is a cross between Holden Caulfield and Don Quixote, with a touch of Rodney Dangerfield thrown in. His rididulously bombastic manner makes for a hilarious read; I haven't laughed out loud like this since parts of Angela's Ashes. Although he does absolutely nothing to earn it, you find yourself slightly endeared to Ignatius J Reilly. Top five funniest books I've ever read. Markedly ahead of its time; could have easily been written 2 years ago instead of 40.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|I had previously considered \\"Bowling For Columbine\\" to be Michael Moore's masterpiece; but after watching \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" I must relegate that earlier work to second place.  \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" is a truly exceptional piece of work, superbly crafted and outstandingly effective; it strips the mask off Capitalism so leisurely and non-chalantly, yet so completely, that only the most die-hard proponents of that monstrously overrated economic system can still claim to accept it at face value or see it as anything other than the most insidious and pervasive system of exploitation of the poor by the rich ever devised.  Above all else, it lays bare once and for all the simple-minded notion of \\"Free Market.\\"  As Mr Moore shows, this \\"Free Market\\" is bought and paid for lock-stock-and-barrel by the super rich; the \\"market\\" is no more \\"free\\" than the gold bars languishing in a bank vault.    It is, in fact, precisely the banks that Mr Moore uses as his wedge to pry open the capitalistic bag of tricks being foisted continually on an unsuspecting and uninformed public.  While he presents the \\"Bank Bailout\\" as the enormous fraud it actually was, he goes beyond that to present the entire spectrum of capitalistic activities as one big fraud after another.  He makes perfectly clear what the public once understood then quickly forgot as they became more affluent; namely, that it was the labor movement and not the largesse of the rich that created the middle class.  Now that the labor movement is all but dead, the real nature of the American people's relationship to the capitalistic paradigm is beginning to reveal itself once again. And it isn't pretty.   Mr Moore's \\"Achilles Heel\\" as a filmmaker has always been a tendency to overplay the pathos inherent in the anecdotal stories of people who have been stripped of their livelihood, their homes and their dignity by the system.  I credit him, this time, with knowing when to stop short of languishing too long on the pathos, focusing instead on the larger picture of thousands, even millions, of people getting stuck permanently with the short end of the big \\"trickle down\\" stick because of their foolish but carefully sublimated belief that they, too, can become as rich as the super rich.    This documentary achieves one other, ironic if unintended, goal: it gives the lie to documentarian Alex Jones' spurious contention that Michael Moore is a dupe of the bankers.  Jones contends that, because Moore did not suscribe to the idea that \\"911\\" was an inside job in his \\"Farenheit 911,\\" he is ipso facto a pawn of the bankers.  Far from being a pawn, though, Michael Moore, in his \\"Capitalism: A Love Story,\\" deals more expeditiously with the bankers than all of Alex Jones' films put together - and does so without straying into the realm of pure conjecture.  Which is precisely why Moore has managed to preserve his credibility, whereas Jones - an equally gifted documentarian - has all but squandered his.
B002ZG98CS|4.0|Machete sure delivered the throwback vibe to the exploitation flicks of the 1970's. They should have paired it up with Piranha 3-D and called it Grindhouse 2. Ever since the fake trailer in Grindhouse, fans have been calling for a feature length version, starring one of the toughest looking dudes to ever grace the screen.<br /><br />It's about time Danny Trejo, who I can't believe is 66 years old, finally gets the lead role. While he plays a great quiet menace (few faces can strike fear with just one look), he is supported with maybe the best cast ever to be assembled for a pure trash (in the best sense) film. Robert De Niro, Steven Segal and Don Johnson all play villain roles and they seem to having a blast. This is Steven Segal's best work (not saying much I know, but he fit's the part) and Robert De Niro, who seems to be channeling some of his Cape Fear accent, hasn't done anything this memorable in the last decade. Of the three main female roles, only Michelle Rodriguez leaves an impact. Jessica Alba is okay, but not all that believable, and Lindsay Lohan's character seemed like an afterthought. Cheech Marin provided a couple of good laughs, one having to do with...you guessed it, a certain green substance.<br /><br />I was worried the whole political message about illegal immigration would be too much, but it fit the mold of the story and didn't get too heavy. The script takes itself seriously for the most part, but there is a decent amount of humor. There was actually a bit more to the plot than I had expected going in, but don't worry, you'll still get plenty of lines made of only the sharpest cheese.<br /><br />The fight scenes and gore are fantastic. Machete likes to lop off heads and body parts using his namesake, but that doesn't stop him from trying out the occasional pistol, corkscrew, pimped out weed wacker with saws for blades, hospital knives turned into a swinging mace, a mini-gun strapped to the front of a motorcycle, and many, many more. Did I mention that he uses some poor guys' intestine, while he's still alive, in order to jump out a window and reach the floor below? So sick, yet so undeniably creative. The fights are edited in quick Robert Rodriguez fashion, but you never really lose sight of what's happening to who.<br /><br />On the downside, even though it didn't drag bad enough for me to check my watch, around 10-15 minutes could have been trimmed off to make it flow a little better. Oh, and what the heck happened to Tom Savini's character? He just vanished.<br /><br />The movie ends by claiming Machete will return in the sequel, Machete Kills, and the third entry in the trilogy, Machete Kills Again. I guess it's really more of a joke, unless it does well enough at the box office.<br /><br />This is the guy movie The Expendables wishes it was. I thought Stallone's effort was average, especially now, after seeing just one lone man with more raw toughness oozing out of his worn and scarred face than all those Expendable guys combined.poor guys' intestine, while he's still alive, in order to jump out a window and reach the floor below?

B002JVWR9U|4.0|Besides Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, I haven't really been into the vampire thing, especially the explosion it has seen in recent years. When this show was first announced on the CW Network, I was a little leery, but hopeful. When series producer/writer Kevin Williamson(Scream, Dawson's Creek) said it would be \\"more Buffy than Twilight\\", I was intrigued and hopeful. Could it be?. This was the CW and all, but I was optimistic. I am so glad I tuned in. Let's get started....    \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" takes place in a nice little town called Mystic Falls. Elena Gilbert and her brother Jeremy(Nina Dobrev, Steven R. McQueen) are high school students. They live with their aunt after the death of their parents. Elena meets mysterious broody guy Stefan(Paul Wesley), vampire, and sparks fly. Unfortunatley for them and the town, Stefan's brother Damon(Ian Somerhalder), wild vampire extraordinaire, comes to town and begins to shake things up amongst the locals and Elena's group of friends.    Okay, obviously that is the short, condensed version of things. Truth is, A LOT goes on in this show. It has a decent sized cast with recurring members coming and going. That's not even the tip of the iceberg. Better to let you watch and discover everything unfold in the show yourself. Amongst the 22 episodes of season 1, here are some of the stuff you can expect. Again, the condensed version of a few eps as to not give much away. The \\"Pilot\\" episode was good, sets things up, but isn't indicative of the maturing and twists and turns the show would make over the season. \\"The Night Of The Comet\\", episode 2, is the episode where Elena and Damon first meet. It's a Founder's party in episode 4, \\"Family Ties\\", where we learn some of the town elders know of the town's dark secrets. This is when the show starts to grow and take interesting turns. Stefan finally explains his past to Elena, via flashbacks to 1864, in episode 6, \\"Lost Girls\\". Halloween rears it's festive head in episode 7, \\"Haunted\\", which also deals with the death of a character. New history teacher Alaric Saltzman(Matt Davis)shows up in episode 9, \\"History Repeating\\", and he may be more than just a history teacher. Damon also reveals his true motives for showing up in town in this episode. Episode 13, \\"Children Of The Dammned\\", features more 1864 flashbacks. \\"Let The Right One In\\", episode 17, has Damon and Elena rescuing Stefan. Elena and Jeremy's shady uncle John shows up in town in episode 18, \\"Under Control\\". \\"Miss Mystic Falls\\", episode 19, has Elena learning of Stefan's recent urges while competing in a Founder's Day gala. Episode 22, the season finale, \\"Founder's Day\\", is a whirlwind of a finale. There were at least 4 cliffhangers in this episode that made every fan want to jump to season 2 immediatley.    Like many, I feared TVD would be lighter and watered down ala \\"Twilight\\", but I am here to wipe away those fears. While TVD is not in the league of that slayer in Sunnydale, it is far from the land of Edward and Bella. TVD is darker, edgier, sexier, more violent, more dangerous, and filled with more history and shocking surprises and twists and turns. Kevin Williamson and crew have created a show that continually surprised me with story twists during the entire season. It seemed they weren't happy unless they ended almost every episode with a shocker. Credit goes to Williamson and the rest of the show's writers. They have really created an atmopsheric town filled with rich characters. Some may seem like CW-lite teen people from the beginning, but that changes. The whole show changes. You can really see the show gaining ground and it's bearings as the debut season rolls along. It really is different to watch the finale and then the pilot. It also doesn't hurt that TVD boasts the best looking cast on TV. Would you expect anything less on the CW?. Despite the attractiveness of the cast, they can act. They are not just faces. Nina Dobrev, as Elena, is an amazing, soulful beauty, asis Katerina Graham as best friend Bonnie. However, it is Ian Somerhalder as Damon who seems to be having the most fun. He eats every scene he is in with bravado, humor, and a sense of danger. He is amazing to watch all season long.    In the end, \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" proved to be a success. It was better than I was hoping. Much, much better. It surpassed most of my expectations to become a fresh vampire show filled with many plots and surprises. You can't ask for more than that.
0385737955|5.0|This book is difficult to review but I'm going with the 'I love it' 5 star criteria for Amazon as it's a gripping page turner.<br />It's a fantastic story with great characters who evolve and change very much like the maze world they inhabit. The premise of teenagers being delivered up into the maze with their personal memories wiped is compelling from start to finish. It's a long book - 371 pages of smaller than average print for a YA book which really immerses you in the plot. The interactions between the fifty or so male characters are very honest and real - often endearing but equally sometimes violent. Probably people are going to criticise this book for being to much like 'Lord of the Flies' but this is a very different setting and premise and brilliantly done.<br />The villians hovering unseen in the background probably watching the children and delivering them supplies are perhaps scarier than the slug with swiss army knife appendage 'Grievers' roaming the maze but the mystery, menace and children make a real page turner.<br />BUT there is a lot wrong with this book which will possibly drive you to distraction. The main gripe being it probably holds the world record for the number of times the word/name Thomas appears. \\"Thomas...Thomas...Thomas...Thomas\\". It became a real sticking point around page 74 onwards (I even turned the corner of the book at that page thinking that was the moment the book was never going to reach 5 stars and would shortly be flung on the 'to read pile' only to be resurrected in the next snow in or other book deprivation catastrophy). \\"Thomas snapped out of his daze and focused on Newt, who'd been talking for who knew too long; Thomas hadn't heard a word of it\\" being one of the prime examples of Thomas overuse. The author perhaps needs to give his audience greater credit for working out who is speaking or doing what. However despite not taking in a lot of early sections of the book \\"Thomas...Thomas... Thomas\\" the compelling story line drove the book to a fantastic conclusion.<br />I would really recommend it for teenagers aged 14+ especially if they loved the Hunger Games trilogy. I will be buying the next in the series...e book to a fantastic conclusion.   I would really recommend it for teenagers aged 14+ especially if they loved the Hunger Games trilogy.

0792160347|5.0|[[ASIN:0792160347 American Gigolo]] This is a stylish movie that I had been looking for at a good price. I found it with this seller. This is the movie that changed fashion from 70s golf casual to 80s designer clothes. Armani and all the other designers owe this movie for bring high fashion to the masses. American Gigolo is as good as I remember it being. It is about the framing for murder of a male prostitute. Richard Gere broke through in this film. Lauren Hutton was the female lead. John Trvolta was first offered this role but did not like the tone. The movie was sexed up quite a bit by Richard Gere. He helped rewrite the script to suit his tastes. I'm very happy I have this movie and I'm happy with the seller... of the DVD.
0439023513|4.0|Contains Minor Spoilers - Please do not read if spoilers annoy you.<br /><br />This book gives a solid conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy but it's not as outstanding as the first two books in the series. The last third of the book unravels into a rushed journey and I found the ending disappointing.<br /><br />Katniss is an unrecognisable wreck of a person in Mockingjay which I guess is the understandable fallout of the previous atrocities she's seen and suffered. Peeta is incapacitated and largely absent until the finale and Gale is torn down in much the same way he was built up to be a hero in the first book. In the end Katniss doesn't even have to choose between Peeta and Gale, events do that for her.<br /><br />Katniss has choices, which aren't really choices, such as to be the Mockingjay or not but is often sedated (very often) and removed from situations only to wake up later. Most of her early behaviour in the book is explained by concussion and her medical wrist band saying she is mentally incapacitated. She is manipulated by District 13 as much as she was by the Capitol. I would even go as far to say I didn't like Katniss in this book as she's too passive and has been broken rather than growing into a woman. She stands on her own two feet (when she's not being medicated) without support but she doesn't have a strong voice to match the role of being the figurehead of the rebellion against the Capitol. She is left rather high and dry without support. Her mother and Prim although being physically there are tied up with hospital duties. The lack of another constant strong character in this book makes this just the Katniss Show although there are some star cameos. Finnick almost steals the limelight but isn't developed enough to be quite the equal male foil to Katniss as Gale and Peeta were in previous books. Even Haymitch is rather muted in this book and I think Mockingjay suffers from not having a strong male voice in the story - that was one of the major strengths of the previous books.<br /><br />Not to say this was a bad book - I came away from this book disappointed but just because the previous books set the bar at an incredibly high standard.<br /><br />The plot wasn't particularly shocking. The ending fell flat as it had been flagged up long ago with the pyschological weapons side of things. There are no red herrings or surprises in this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for something similar to read after the Hunger Games then I highly recommend looking at the Chaos Walking series by Patrick Ness. The Maze Runner (first in a trilogy) by James Dashner is also worth a look.ous books.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Negating a certain one star review that made no sense and rambled on for no good reason. Get a life, dude. You know who you are.    In any case, this is a great set. Personally, I am a fan of all 4 movies and have waited for a Blu set to come out. I may wind up going for the limited egg addition, but it will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine. If you are a fan of the series, this is a must. Nothing like killing some aliens in HD.
B003UYUR10|5.0|This movie came under a lot nit-picking criticism due to the fact that it's a film adaptation of a video game. Track records for video game adaptations being as bad as they are, everyone, including myself, was prepared to hate this movie. I was totally surprised, i loved this movie.<br /><br />The action scenes were engaging and fun to watch. The editing made it a little difficult to see what was happening at times, but for the most part it was easy to distinguish what was going on. Each action sequence was relevant to the story and came frequently enough to never let the viewer get bored, and not too frequently to detract from the plot or characters.<br /><br />The characters were all likable and entertaining, if not entirely original. I was sad at the deaths of characters that were meant to sadden the viewers at their demise and was happy with the conclusion of the film. Without giving away any spoilers, i will say i usually hate when any medium of entertainment pulls a huge switch that effects so much of the plot as the one in here, but i actually enjoyed how it played out.<br /><br />I recommend Prince of Persia to fans of the games along with fans of film
B002L5GQGY|5.0|AMAZING!!! to put it mildly.  Buying this concert DVD may be your first Joe Bonamassa purchase, but it will not be your last.  Joe writes his own, sings his own and plays his own.  JB is a POWERHOUSE guitar slinger!  If you like Eric Clapton inspired blues/rock, this is for you!
B002ZG97E2|5.0|I don't know a single person who hadn't enjoyed this movie! It's cute, fun, funny, well thought out and brilliantly played. The 3 orphans are so adorable especially the youngest Agnes and it makes you want to have kids too if you don't already. The scheme of the story is to steal the moon-although juvenile, the story works and the comic relief of the minions will keep you giggling and the mother played by Julie Andrews is surprisingly funny as well. I saw this movie twice in the theatre and can't wait to watch it again on dvd.
030726999X|5.0|Having read the first two books of this trilogy I thought perhaps this last<br />one would be anticlimactic. Not so. It was as riveting as the others. The characters, especially Lisbeth Salander, are more fully developed and all is tied together to explain who she really is. In the end I felt like I lost a friend...no more Stieg Larson books.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Im glad i got it for only $36 yesterday. I love amazon and it'll be surprising us with great deals. Nice start for a great collection.
0439023513|5.0|I HATE HATE HATE war stories. I only read [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] and [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] because I wanted to read a story similar to [[ASIN:B000F4LPJ6 Battle Royale: Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)]]. This 3rd book turned out to be a WAR STORY. Blood, guts, people being tortured, blown up, killed. CHILDREN dying, important cast members dying, important cast members being permanently bodily scarred. I actually was impressed, she wrote war but she wrote it realistically. There's nothing that annoys me more than a war story where the hero and all the hero's loved ones and love interest get away unscratched, Mockingjay was satisfying in that the author allowed her characters to get hurt and suffer and lose.<br /><br />Honestly, I read the bad reviews and I understand how a lot of readers were upset about certain people dying and whatnot but I was satisfied with the ending. I don't think a trilogy where children have been sent to a televised event in order to KILL EACH OTHER for the last 75 years could have ended in a soft fluffy way all wrapped up in a tidy little bow. I think the author fulfilled her promise and did a solid job wrapping up the story.

0525421580|5.0|I've just finished Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green and David Levithan.<br /><br />Others have already raved about this book, so I won't add much more other than to say---read it! It's very funny, and it brought to mind memories and situations I haven't thought about for ages, of my own high school days and all the drama to be found in friendships and romantic relationships when a person is that age. Definitely recommended.<br /><br />(Don't forget to watch the little video interview with one of the authors, here on the Amazon listing---very funny.)<br /><br />The dust jacket on this one cannot be duplicated on a computer screen; it's one of those holographic covers in which the colours shift according to the angle of the light, while different details swim in and out of focus; looks almost three-dimensional. I was looking at it in direct sunlight, and as it nearly blinded me I suddenly thought \\"Aha, I totally get this!\\" The cover is, in fact, just what you would see if you are standing on stage looking out into a darkened auditorium (there's even a hint of the lighting gridwork at the top). It's been many years since I trod the boards---not since high school---but suddenly I was transported back to a moment on stage in the spotlight. And that's just how the book ends---with a big climactic scene with all the characters performing an outrageous musical that I would absolutely LOVE to see!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Great service and product-offering overall. Will be happy to do business with this seller again.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|There is little to add to the other many five star reviews.  I have never seen a film deal so directly and movingly with the subject of death.  And the acting was so excellent that I marveled at it throughout the film.<br /><br />I especially loved the performance of Tsutomu Yamazaki, who subtly plays the boss of the young man who unexpectedly finds himself working as an encoffiner(the art of \\"Nokanshi\\")when he mistakenly answers a classified ad thinking it is for a tour agent.  As he continues in his new profession of preparing the dead for funerals and entry to the next life, he grows in awareness and has a new weltanschauung as a result.  He doesn't tell his wife until she finds out by accident what he is doing.  Then she is revolted and disgusted.  But she comes round in the end to also see life differently.<br /><br />The only weakness I could find in the film is that I felt the beginning moved along a little too slowly, while the final scene would have been more effective had it been a bit shorter.<br /><br />All in all, a decidedly great, profound and extremely moving (sometimes even very comical) cinematic feat which gives one food for thought long after one has viewed it, which is what all great movies do.

0765348276|5.0|***Spoiler free Review***     Scalzi writes like the masters of old, but he also incorporates his own style...  The result is a modern masterpiece that has a great 'old time' feel and is a great homage to the great works before it.    The writing comes across as real and not 'pretend'.  The characters are so well done, the worldbuilding is superb, the dialogue is AMAZING, this book just basically does everything right.      But more importantly, he gives you a phenonmenal story.  I don't know how I've gone this long without ever having read Scalzi, but i'm glad i've corrected that problem.  He is now in my top ten of best Sci-Fi writers ever and FWIW, i've been reading a book a week for over 20 years.    anyways, this book is a must read, read it cover to cover in two days.

0374158460|5.0|Franzen eviscerates NIMBY liberals. He is pitch perfect with the family's intentions and their ultimate demise. His words are beautifully crafted; perhaps he is our generation's Updike? A perfect second act to The Corrections.
1439181780|1.0|Since 'The Secret' was greatly lacking any explanation of HOW to 'create,' I can't imagine this book to be any better. And many people know that Rhonda Bryne literally 'stole' the concept/idea of 'the law of attraction' from Abraham/Hicks. Do any research on that and you'll find it to be true (You Tube is good). So in that regard, it makes it too hard for me to trust anything new from this author to be her own work OR to have complete information on any subject - she seems to have a nack for leaving out important information and the 'work' not to be her own.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|James Taylor and Carole King are icons in the rock genre.  This album presents a very entertaining rendition of some of their greatest hits.  Though their voices have aged and not every note is strictly in-tune, this dvd/cd is still worth listening and viewing.  I would recommend this item to fans of either or both JT and CK.
1844281116|4.0|Cobbled together out of thinly disguised excerpts from James Bond novels, but well met for its target audience, Stormbreaker is fun in the Ian Fleming spirit.<br /><br />How much homage does Stormbreaker pay to Fleming?<br /><br />Sayle, the bad guy, is a remake of Hugo Drax from Moonraker.  (Get the nifty rhyme there--Moonraker, Stormbreaker...)  Both men are foreigners with an ax to grind against England because they were bullied in school.  Both are fabulously wealthy, both have mysterious ties to a foreign power.  Both offer England a Trojan Horse.  Drax gives England the Moonraker missile.  Sayle has the Stormbreaker computer.<br /><br />In Stormbreaker, Horowitz takes the giant squid from Dr. No and repackages it as a giant jellyfish.<br /><br />He takes Rosa Klebb from From Russia with Love and turns her into a German.  M, Q Branch, and Oddjob all found their way into Stormbreaker with new names and identities, and the deus ex machina ending will feel familiar to those who have read Casino Royale.<br /><br />It works.  The story is fun, familiar, and perfectly written for its intended audience.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I must start this review by saying that of course that movie contained other good acting performances by the other actors and actresses in the movie. However, the reason that Leonardo Di Caprio stands out in a good way in this movie is due to the fact that I feel that he has given one of his best performances since \\"Titanic\\". I, like many others, first heard of him through the movie \\"Titanic\\". Leo plays as Domm Cobb, one of the men who has a very influential role in getting information from others through their dreams. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, as Leo's competent assistant who helps him recruit a reluctant protege (Ellen Page) to help in accomplishing a job given out to him by Mr. Saito, the tourist. Along the way Dom and Arthur mastermind getting help from others to accomplish their dream assignments. The plot is very well put together with vivid imagery on how dreams can turn out. If you liked Leonardo DiCaprio in \\"Titanic'\\", then it is a safe bet that you are going to like \\"Inception\\" because the acting is superb from Leo and the other actors and actresses involved in the movie.
B0037QGS0A|2.0|Two stars for the three leads and nothing else.    Boring, slow story; Chloe's motivations are unclear at best; another too-familiar tale of a family with lots of money and a nice house but nothing much going for them; self-absorbed people doing stupid, self-destructive things; stalker girl; dumb ending.    Nothing else to say.
B002ZG9788|5.0|This is an excellent retelling of the legend of Perseus and the clash of the titans (Medusa and the Kraken.) The graphics of this remake are far superior to the 1981 film of the same name whose \\"graphics\\" were done by Ray Harryhausen. Harryhausen did good work on other films (in particular one of my favorites-Jason and the Argonauts from the early 1960's), but hey, let's face it; this was not one of Harryhausen's better efforts. The underwater shots, the giant scorpions, the battle with Medusa, the flying horse Pegasus, the ultimate destruction of the Kraken, etc, the whole film is magnificent. For anyone who likes Greek Mythology or just plain good movies with good plots, good photography/graphics, etc, this is a must-have. Especially on High-Definition Bluray.
B0029XZODY|1.0|I'm still having trouble trying to figure out how this show (if you can call it that!) came to be.     Very 1-dimensional characters, a main character who is onto himself a criminal, yet he claims to be the good guy!     Don't waste your time or money on this total waste.

0765326353|5.0|By far my favorite Sanderson work has been Mistborn, though Stormlight Archive will probably come to supplant it. I'm now on my second read-through, having been so captivated by the book that I read it very quickly the first time.  It is far too complex, however, to pick up all the details of character, plot, and world when you read it that fast. (There are also clues that you won't recognize as clues until the end of the book!) I find that I'm enjoying it as much, if not more the second time.    As with Mistborn, Sanderson does an excellent job writing powerful, relevant women who lack some of the more annoying traits other fantasy writers mistake for strong female qualities. (Though I sympathize with other reviewers' complaints about his reliance on \\"wittiness.\\") It will be interesting to see how some of these characters' storylines become entangled in later volumes. ( Sanderson resists the temptation to start off with a group of heroes that is later separated, reunited, separated, etc.)    By the end of the first book, Sanderson has given the reader a sense of where the series is going and what the stakes are.  Anyone who has read Mistborn knows, though, that these expectations will likely be thwarted.  (This is part of the fun of reading Sanderson.) Sanderson has a clear understanding of the conventions of the genre he is writing in.  At times, he'll embrace them, at other times, he'll subvert or put his own spin on them, though never gratuitously. In the same way The Wheel of Time dominated my 20's (yes, I started late), Stormlight Archive will dominate my 30's. Eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B002SYXCVK|3.0|Sting is one of my favorite artists and I like these songs.  But what in the world is he trying to do with his voice?  I can see he's aiming for a more \\"legit\\" classical sound with this, but it sounds contrived.  I'm disappointed, but that's just my opinion.
0812550706|5.0|You might have arrived here because this book is such a widely acclaimed science fiction title (Nebula and Hugo awards). You might have come because a friend urged you to read it (and maybe even gave you a copy).  You might be interested because it has such a vast number or rave reviews here on Amazon.  Reading the synopsis however, you wonder if you'll relate to a child character or, if you're not a sci-fi aficionado, you wonder if it will really be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Well, as you can see by perusing these reviews, a great many of which are written by people who do not usually read sci-fi and noting the intensity, joy and emotion with which people praise the book, I think you can take a chance that it very likely will be your cup of tea.<br /><br />I only read a bit of sci-fi and mostly like books full of action that keep me turning pages, so I was a little skeptical myself, but this book satisfied me on every level.  It had the elements of an exciting thriller, the characters are memorable, appealing and well drawn, it made me think (without being pedantic or heavy) and I enjoyed the crisp writing style. The best novels for me are the ones that create the most vivid self-created mental pictures and this is one of the best of this kind that I've ever read. There's nothing like that buzz of a whole world which you have created in your mind with the aid of an author who knows just how much framework to provide for you.<br /><br />As if you needed me to add to the resounding chorus of praise you can see here on Amazon, I'd say if you're unsure, take the plunge.  You will simply never forget Ender and I think this is simply a superb novel.
1453767533|5.0|Jane Austen's first completed novel is lighter and more humorous in tone than her subsequent work.  It is however, as beautifully written as that later work - there was, as always with Austen, a lot of rewriting before publication, which in this case was posthumous - and it is in no sense an inferior effort.<br /><br />All her novels have a sly, subversive wit, but Northanger Abbey is the one in which she employs her humor more or less throughout, although darker elements emerge as the story develops.<br /><br />It is basically a satire on the Gothic novel, a genre still familiar to us through movies, and makes particular reference to The Mysteries of Udolpho.  You don't need to have read that to appreciate the humor; you just need to have some idea of what a Gothic story is, with its gloomy castles, secret chambers and dastardly deeds.  In fact, in the episodes that take place in the abbey, the author shows herself very capable of building mystery and tension.  She could have written a splendid Gothic horror.<br /><br />Austen's extraordinary insight into human nature is already evident here.  In chapter 5 of this book - which has more author intervention than any of her others - she presents a defense or justification of the novel as a literary form, in which she says, \\"...the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties...are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language\\".  That is certainly true of Austen's own novels.<br /><br />The Signet Classics edition has an introduction by Margaret Drabble which is more an excuse for Drabble to express some of her own prejudices.  You certainly shouldn't read it before the novel, because it contains spoilers.  The Afterword by Stephanie Laurens is much better and is worth reading.  There are no end notes or footnotes to explain the many references and archaisms in the novel.  I suspect there are other editions with better editorial content.<br /><br />[PeterReeve]
0515141429|3.0|Yes, it's ridiculously implausible. No, it's not Shakespeare. No, sensible women rarely fall in love with unshowered hulking hobos who are sitting in holding pens. Yes, Mr. Child should probably have a custom rule in his word processor that alerts him to overuse of the terms \\"shrug\\" and \\"shrugged\\" (123 appearances in this novel).<br /><br />We've all heard the gripes, but having gotten that out of the way, this is a rip-roaring, action-packed page turner that any fan of this kind of thing will probably be fairly pleased with. I was, anyway.  If you're an english lit major who just finished Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" and you're looking for you next beefy read, move on (unless you secretly read crime thrillers for the pure fun of it).<br /><br />Lots of bone crunching dust-ups, horrific crime scenes, plot twists and a very exciting conclusion.  I rate it 3 stars because I rate all books on the same scale, but if I were rating just within this genre, I'd maybe give it 4 stars.  I am new to the Reacher series, but on the basis of this one, I will be reading the next one and am assuming that as Child develops the character in subsequent novels, they will get even better.
B002K0WBYG|3.0|This is a most enjoyable movie. It has enough twists to the plot to keep one watching. More like Sandra Bullock's movies of late.
B0015DROBO|5.0|At first I was not interested in reading this trilogy because quite frankly, the title of this book (the first in the trilogy) didn't attract me.  I thought it was related to tattoos and bikers or something like that.  But then I saw that the books (all three) were consistently on the top list for Kindle as well as the NYT Bestseller list.  So I downloaded a sample.  For those of you who own a Kindle, download samples of the Kindle bestsellers.  You will discover why the books are on there!  At least for me, downloading the samples has been the best decision most of the time.<br /><br />Anyway, these books were so riveting (aside from the first few chapters in the Dragon Tattoo) that I could hardly put them down.  I read all three in 6 days.  Give the first few chapters in Dragon Tattoo a chance--they just establish the background of some of the main characters.  After the \\"move to Hedeby\\" the book takes off!<br /><br />Two things I would say--because the names and locations are Swedish, sometimes it is hard to keep some straight but the author was very good to give some context when he returned to a character or location.  I appreciated that writing style.<br /><br />I just wish the author were able to write more books for us to enjoy.  I recommend these books the way I recommend John Le Carre.  Of course, they are popular fiction, not Charles Dickens, but the writing far surpasses most popular mystery thrillers.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|Every time I read a review of a new Roots CD/Album there is always someone complaining. Too dark, too negative was what was said about the last two releases. Now its too poppy and not hip hop. Please make up your mind! What I like and respect about the Roots is their willingness to explore and try new things. When they gave up their more jazzy flavorings everyone wrote them off but they came up with something original. It wasn't easy to listen to and it was challenging....but what amazing stuff.     Getting to this CD. Not as challenging as the last couple but a more positive cd and a marriage of their various directions. Black Thought lyricism continues to be incredible. Every track is great except one(I agree with others that the last track felt like it came from a different cd--doesn't work!) and it pretty much holds together as a complete work (except that last tune) and that makes it significantly stronger than the last few releases which were less coherent. I'm far from a John Legend fan and they made him sound good (which I didn't think was possible) and introduced me to a bunch of performers I wasn't familiar. Questlove's drumming and musicianship continues to amaze and tariq's \\"singing\\" was a shock and very impressive.     On the whole one of my favorite cd's of the year.
B003ITZBW2|4.0|I love love love this movie! The reason why I do not give this 5 stars is because of the 2-Disc DVD.  The featurette about Jason Todd that is on the Blu-Ray is not here.  I think it would have been great to see in on here since Jason is so important to the story.  Also, there is only an hour of features on the 2nd Disc so it's not as if there is not room in the disc for this 21 minute feature.
B000002VMD|5.0|I was looking for this cd for a long time. It arrive brand new as they said. The sound is excellent
0439023513|3.0|Loved the first two books, and couldn't wait to get into this one.  Was ok, but not great.  Anticlimactic ending. Ends on kind of a downer.  Character development weaker in this book.  Rebellion/war against capitol develops really fast with little or no detail.  One chapter she becomes the face of the rebellion, and it seems like by the next, it's almost over.  Overall, a little disappointing.
0375703764|5.0|Very trippy writing, but an excellent read! This book is extremely original, and definitely keeps your interest going.

B00063EMJ6|4.0|After Bob Dylan, Neil Young is the man.  I have the remastered albums Neil Young, After The Goldrush and Harvest and they are all fantastic, therefore it's best of the remainder of his work that I am looking for.  I am rewarded with Helpless, Ohio and especially Like A Hurricane, Neil's guitar playing at it's best. Think Southern Man and then add much more.  I would have liked to have had these included, On The Beach and Philidelpha, from the film soundtrack.  Easily worth 4 stars, all CD collections should have this one!

Review:  The first thing I want to say about this book is that Maggie Stiefvater can write. Sometimes the prose gets a little bit carried away with itself (\\"I was a leaking womb\\"?????) but for the most part it is lyrical and graceful and sets a beautiful tone as the background to this star-crossed lovers romance. I love a YA paranormal romance, and frankly, I'm not all that fussy about it having to have great writing - I read them for escapist purposes and can overlook just about anything so long as the story is engaging. But in this case, it is really nice to come across a YA book that is not only a good story, but the characters, plot and writing are well developed and polished.    The narration is told from both Grace and Sam's perspectives. Their voices are distinct, and the story flows well. Grace and Sam are interesting to read about as separate people as well as reading about their romance. Their families are fascinating and help to explain Grace and Sam's personalities and their motivations. Their attraction and romance feels genuine and was beautiful to read. The supporting characters are also distinct and well developed, and I'm looking forward to following on with all of them in Linger, the next book in the series.    The other thing that really stood out for me in this story is the descriptions of the woods. They are described so beautifully and vividly and are such an amazing setting for this story, it wouldn't be the same without it.    I will definitely read Linger, and now also Lament and Ballad, Maggie Stiefvater's other series about Faeries.

B00005JLD4|4.0|Watching this movie was an assignment for me in my Religion class online. I was not sure about how the movie would be, but after watching it I really enjoyed it. I felt the movie was an absolute illustration of faith, and of hope. It really tugs at your heartstrings and also shows you that no matter what one may think or tell you, you can do whatever you set your mind to. The acting is very good, and the story line is wonderful. The movie creates a wonderful picture of the love of children for their mother and their home, through their determination to get back there once they are taken away. One sister breaks away and becomes desperate, but this does not take away from the determination of the other two sisters. I was even more amazed that this was a true story. I believe that this movie relates to my class in the following ways: It truly shows you what \\"faith\\" is, and illustrates that with the incredible faith that the main characters hold strong. Even the men who are trying to keep the children from their mother are utilizing incredible determination to destroy what they know as family. I feel that the bond the sisters had together, and with their mother and grandmother, was a true testament to free will, faith and hope.

0439023483|5.0|I literally read this book cover-to-cover in 1 day. It was by far one of the best books I have ever read. I always buy books online so I can get good deals but after reading the first book I had to go to the bookstore and buy the second one for full hardcover price. I am about 50 pages in and was definitely worth the $20.<br /><br />The way she describes all the details was so riveting that I found myself really connecting with the characters in the book. I would say anyone from 12 to 100 would enjoy the action/love/suspense of this amazing book!
B00004TL2N|4.0|With so many reviews already, I don't know that another one is needed, but here are my own impressions about  the Boulez recording of what is probably Bruckner's greatest symphony:<br /><br />I've heard recordings of this symphony by other conductors/orchestras in the past and always thought they, and the symphony, were long-winded and rather boring.  (There seems to be a custom of performing Bruckner ever so slo-o-owly, regardless of Bruckner's indicated tempi.)  Then I acquired the Furtwaengler/Berlin Philharmonic recording of 1949 at the Titania Palast and was immediately swept away by this exciting performance, in spite of the poor sound quality and a tuberculotic audience, and despite (or maybe because of) the tempo accelerandos and decelerandos that Furtwaengler indulged in.  I still listen to this recording and find it never fails to thrill me.<br /><br />So, my goal became to find a performance on CD that had some of this excitement but with good sound and without so much recorded coughing.  I tried von Karajan, whose 7th with the Berlin Philharmonic is splendid, but found his 8th to be one of those afflicted with the draggy tempi syndrome.  Then I found out about the Boulez recording and noticed that the length of each Boulez movement was almost exactly (to within a few seconds) the same length of the corresponding Furtwaengler movements.  Aha! I thought, here's the recording for me!  The fact that the recording was made live at St Florian on the 100th anniversary of Bruckner's death was a plus.<br /><br />What I found was that even though the movement lengths are the same,  the Boulez lacks the thrill of the Furtwaengler, so it is not really a modern substitute.  Unlike Furtwaengler, Boulez keeps strict tempo nearly all the time (with a few exceptions in the slow movement); that may have something to do with the loss of dramatic punch.  Furtwaengler was a member of the old school of conducting with a tradition of rubato and tempo variation, whereas Boulez is of the more modern school of strict time.  Which would Bruckner prefer?  Rubatic performance was probably what he was used to in his time; on the other hand, he marked tempi very carefully and may have preferred strict adherence.  As at least one other reviewer pointed out, the fine architecture of the symphony is more readily apparent in the Boulez than in other, more dramatic recordings.<br /><br />I think Boulez is at his best in the slow movement, which is possibly Bruckner's greatest symphonic movement.  There is a near-perfect blend of carefully controlled drama with architectural clarity in Boulez's interpretation.  (Note that Boulez follows the Haas edition of the score, which has some extra passages that are left out of the Nowak edition.)  In the other three movements, architecture wins out over drama.  A positive is that the relatively quick tempi (compared to most other recordings) are not draggy; on the other hand they never sound rushed either.  The scherzo is taken fairly lightly and rapidly - much better I think than some of the ponderous versions I've heard.  It's the two outer movements where I wish Boulez had injected a bit more Furtwaenglerian drama.<br /><br />Among the real positives is the quality of sound in this recording, especially considering that it was mastered from a live performance.  There is no audible audience coughing or other noise.  The Vienna Philharmonic plays beautifully, and every instrumental line is heard clearly.  This is partly because Boulez, thinking architecturally, holds back on climaxes so they don't drown out the inner voices.  The sound is reasonably crisp without being dry and harsh; that's also quite an accomplishment given that the performance was in a cathedral-like space.  There isn't a problem with echoes or reverberation.  Maybe the recording engineers had to do a lot of work on this, but the result is excellent sound.<br /><br />A DVD of this special anniversary concert is scheduled for release in Sept2010.  St Florian has a gorgeous baroque interior, so a visual recording of this performance will be a real treat.ior, so a visual recording of this performance will be a real treat.

1401922732|2.0|I have never been more disappointed than I am with the art work of Archangel Michael on each card.  The front of each card DOES NOT depict Archangel Michael but rather a human figure that looks more like a fallen angel.  The colors do not define the real Archangel Michael, the figure is kneeling in tones of red/beige/brown.  Truthfully Doreen mislead us.  You would have thought she would have selected the picture you see on the front of the box.  I am surprised Doreen Virtue lowered her standards.  The front of each card is equally as important as what is on the other side. This is not heavenly energy...I am returning these cards.

This is my first copy of Abbey Road, and the only question I have is \\"why didn't I buy this  sooner?\\"  It is a remarkable piece of music -- I can hardly think of an album (they will forever be that for me, even in the age of CDs) where the tracks fit together so seamlessly.  I don't know that it's possible to get by with only *one* Beatles album -- and I certainly wouldn't try to resolve the \\"Beatles best album dilemma,\\" but this is a classic piece of music, blending pop, orchestral, and, yes, perhaps, religious influences.

0374158460|4.0|Freedom is a good novel, a very good novel, and that's what my main point is. Franzen has written four novels: his last two, Freedom and the Corrections, are very good; yet, his first two, the Twenty-seventh City and Strong Motion, are two of the worst novels I've ever read--just horrible. He's demonstrated tremendous growth as a novelist. The hype for Freedom is all justified; I doubt a better book has been or will be published this year, or anytime soon. The book was worth the 9-year wait from the Corrections. Sort of like the 9-10-year waits b/tw Updike's Rabbit books, those wonderful updates on the status of white America that we are now without. Franzen is good, but he's not as populist a writer as I think Updike was; and thus he misses the mark on objectivtiy b/c he's too clouded by his own ideology.    Enough has been written about the themes and characters of this book, and there's no need for me to rehash them. There's a great dynamic between them, and the characters are all very real, not just symbols of themes and ideas being pushed against each other for effect. Walter is a big fan of birds (so is Franzen), and has quite the loathing for cats, and provides details as to how house and feral cats abuse the helpless and beautiful (when they aren't crapping on my car) bird population. It's no coincidence that Walter's friend, the rock-star chick-magnet Richard has the last name of Katz, and that he treats women the way cats treat birds, as playthings.     The War and Peace love triangle reference is a fine one, given the circumstances, but a better one would have been Anna Karenina, only because all unhappy families are indeed uniquely unhappy. The Berglunds unhappiness is much different from the Lamberts in the Corrections.    I enjoyed the reference to the Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard; he's the character Richard Katz's favorite writer, for good reason. There's a great line in the novel about how when the dream of unlimited freedom sours it often opens aperson to misanthropy and rage (I paraphrase), and Bernhard is the master of literary misanthropy and rage. Hopefully this will generate more interest in him and a wider audience.     If there's on thing to nit-pick it's that a sizable portion of the novel is comprised of an autobiography written by the character Patty Berglund. My problem is that Patty writes too much, if not exactly, like Franzen. It all works just fine, just something to consider.     I'm already looking forward to his next novel. Nine years will be worth the wait.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I bought the X-Grip for camcorder use.  It was shipped fast and arrived in perfect condition.  I appreciate the simple, uncluttered, straightforward design which was executed with quality materials.  Attaching it to the camcorder is swift and easy, and the X-Grip can even be attached to a tripod or other mount when operating the camcorder.  The heavy-duty accessory shoe can be detached.  The grip of the unit is heavily padded and comfortable to use.  Small built-in 'loops' at the top and bottom of the mount can be used to attach additional accessories via zip-ties or other field expedients.  The X-Grip is constructed from very heavy duty plastic and is robust enough to withstand many years of service.  I heartily recommend this unit to all active videographers who want bang for their bucks.
B003K16NO8|5.0|This is very much the first time I put my hands on Aperture and this book was really helpful. Even though it's a quite complex program, this book leads you to different cenarious you are expected to find when using the application in real projects. The examples are very good and I already feel confortable with the screens and commands. I'm indeed very suprised to see how much I learned in a couple of days. I use the program in my macbook and the book in my iphone. This is quite good because I don't have to keep changing from Aperture to Kinkle app. I've reloaded the original files I've downloaded and start to study the book all over again. I want to make sure I'm able to perform the tasks shown without any doubts. Feel confident, this is a top choice.

030726999X|4.0|Most international bestsellers leave me cold, so I had a built-in prejudice against this trilogy. To be perfectly truthful, this is not a work of great literature. Yet it is a work of great storytelling. After finishing the first book of this series, I did not think that the author could sustain interest over two more lengthy books. But he did that remarkably well and, if anything, the last two books (including this one) were even more compelling than the first two. It's a cliche to call this book (and its companions) a pageturner, but that's what it is.
1553655427|5.0|International do-gooders should be forced to read this book, if necessary by being chained down and having their eyelids propped open - like the incorrigibly violent Alex in &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; - so that they cannot avoid the message:<br /><br />Foreign aid to Africa has not only failed but is responsible for many of the continent's countless ills.<br /><br />Dambisa Moyo is a young Zambian economist. She argues her case with force and brevity, accessible both to the professional economist and the interested lay reader.<br /><br />More than $2 trillion, she says, has been poured into Africa since the end of colonialism. In recent years it's been a fashionable cause for rock stars and other well-meaning celebrities.<br /><br />But there is less than nothing to show for it - a continent arguably poorer and more strife-ridden than it was in 1950.<br /><br />Aid money is &#34;bouffed&#34; (slang in the former French colonies, means &#34;gobbled up corruptly&#34;) by government elites, who use it to support luxurious lifestyles sans any actual achievement meriting it.<br /><br />Little gets to the poor. It feeds corrupt and repressive regimes, who use much of the money on the military to keep themselves in power. Joseph Mobutu stole an estimate $5 billion in Zaire. Robert Mugabe's wife is legendary for her overseas shopping sprees - the Imelda Marcos of southern Africa. Corruption destroys the formation of the reliable civic structure middle-class entrepreneuers need - honest courts that enforce contracts and the like.<br /><br />The foreign aid organizations - NGOs, or non-governmental organizations, suggesting groups of selfless saints uncorrupted by profit or politics - never hold anyone accountable, despite repeated threats to do so. Tens of thousands of their own jobs depend on the continued flow.<br /><br />Dramatic public appeals to dramatize a single problem backfire. Using the fictional example of a small entrepreneur making mosquito nets and employing ten people, Moyo shows how a rock star's donation of a million dollars, buying a hundred thousand nets to fight malaria, floods the local market, driving down the price and putting our entrepreneur out of business.<br /><br />No African country has used foreign aid to emerge from poverty into productivity. The countries who have done best, like Botswana, have weaned themselves off it. Aid accounts for a fraction of Botswana's economy, compared with 75 percent of some of the poorest states.<br /><br />Moyo, meanwhile, tells us what does work, giving examples from both in and out of Africa. They're all market based.<br /><br />--Nations should borrow on the bond market. It forces them to get a bond rating attesting to their creditworthiness, and discourages them from stealing the money if they ever want to borrow again. African governments start to work more like those in more successful nations.<br /><br />--China, avoiding rhetoric or demands regarding human rights, has invested billions in Africa for naked self-interest - development of mineral and agricultural resources China desperately needs to feed its own booming economy and enormous population. The Africans like it because they actually have something to show for it: new railroads, roads, sources of electric power, and every type of infrastructure, all of which makes doing business easier in Africa for all, not just the Chinese. Public opinion polls across Africa show the Chinese are preferred nowadays to the Americans or Europeans. (Moyo is light on the details here, particularly whether Chinese enterprises are owned by the Chinese government or Chinese businesses. Do they foster charges of neo-colonialism? Why not?) The West ignores this kind of direct investment at its peril, as Africa may be drawn entirely, firmly and permanently into the Chinese sphere of influence.<br /><br />--Drop trade barriers. She's hard on Western agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, keeping African commodities out of their markets. (She should have mentioned African farmers' own biggest enemy is the government buying cooperative they often must sell to at a fixed price, a socialist monopoly barely paying farmers' costs while reserving profit for the government.) But she thinks African nations could do more to lower trade barriers between each other, such as tariffs, creating the kinds of duty-free zones represented by NAFTA and the European Union.<br /><br />--Develop financial markets. She likes the popular microfinance idea, of course - lending tiny amounts to the poor in such a way that they tend to pay it back. But in addition, she advocates a more transparent banking sector encouraging people to pull their savings out from under their mattresses (money not working for anyone while it's down there) and deposit it, injecting billions already present in country, into the economy. And remittances - wherein Africans abroad wire billions home to their families - markedly improve the lives of those receiving them and should be encouraged.<br /><br />To get all this going, she says, would take nothing more than a telephone call from the World Bank or the IMF to the head of state notifying him that foreign aid will be cut off entirely in five years, with the amount going down steadily in the interim, save for natural disasters or other emergency assistance.<br /><br />Moyo's critique of foreign aid isn't new.

B0008ENICU|5.0|Witty 1939 comedy about \\"arduous\\" life of rich women living on Park Avenue.  Norma Shearer is luminous and elegant in role of Mary Haines, a wronged wife.  Joan Crawford is believably nasty and horrid in her role as gold-digging homewrecker.  Wonderful supporting cast.    Film was advertised as having no male characters or decorative objects.  However, look for the male ancestor portrait on the wall early in the film, when Mary Haines is on the phone.  Some of the Chinese decorative figurines are also male, as is the bull which is part of the setting during the fashion show.  Can you tell I've watched this movie a few times?
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I've read enough histories and analysis of WWII and wanted to get a view of what it was like to actually be in battle. I got more than I bargained for in this book. In a very well written, simple and straightforward style the author conveys exactly what is was like to live through the terror and carnage of these two battles. I highly recommend this book for anyone curious about what being in battle is like. Some other books I sampled were so poorly written I couldn't get through even a few pages. They were bad amateur authors trying to be poetic and just sounding silly or injecting some half-baked philosophy. Thankfully, E.B. Sledge stays away from all that and sticks to the subject, a good exposition of the effectiveness of simple and clear language. But be prepared - he pulls no punches and the subject matter is not pleasant.

No wonder: with their greasy blues grind, Elvis-influenced chops, and deceptively simple acoustic-electric arrangements, these songs simultaneously look backward to an earlier, more innocent musical tradition, and anticipate the rise of Americana and the Folk Revival of recent years.  This album remains powerful and listenable, and if it runs a bit short, it makes up for its LP-era brevity with a raw power that few artists have been able to approach since.

Now I own the entire set in this unique Blu-ray edition, included are Razor and The Plan.  I must say since I have reviewed the series again one episode after another without commercial or time-lag interference, this show is by far the best drama to ever come out of television.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|I'll admit that I usually shy away from films that seem to be showered in hype.  I like to march to the beat of my own drum when it comes to discovering an under-appreciated gem and yet still found myself intrigued by the glowing opinions surrounding DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda.  Sure Jack Black was decent in Shark Tale and Eastern Philosophy would probably naturally lend itself to the notion of martial arts masters who just so happen to be adorable talking animals but come on! It can't be that great, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />Until picking up Kung Fu Panda, I was pretty thoroughly convinced that aside from Shrek, DreamWorks was doomed to play second fiddle to Pixar in the world of computer generated animated feature films.  Kung Fu Panda manages to combine story originality, magnificent visuals and genuine humor so flawlessly that it is much to Pixar's detriment that they have nothing to offer in terms of competition.<br /><br />KFP tells the tale of Po (Jack Black); a panda that works in a noodle restaurant owned by his father Mr. Ping (James Hong), who just so happens to be a goose. Po is a kung fu fanatic with secret dreams of becoming a great master in the discipline despite no prior training and a body style that favors weight and clumsiness.<br /><br />The tortoise Master Oogway (played brilliantly by Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition that the evil snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), the former student of his own prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), will escape from prison and return to threaten the Valley of Peace.<br /><br />Oogway orders a formal ceremony to choose the Dragon Warrior, a supreme master of kung fu and the one who can defeat the lethal Tai Lung should the premonition come to pass. It is assumed that one of the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) will be chosen for this honor.<br /><br />Po, in attempt to simply spectate the event, finds himself smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. Oogway, surprised by the panda's sudden appearance, designates him the Dragon Warrior and hence Po is immediately in way over his head.<br /><br />It's tough to come up with anything new to add to a film that has already been so thoroughly praised since its inception but that's no excuse for me to refrain from trying.  I was quite dazzled with Kung Fu Panda's solid homages to classic kung fu movies while simultaneously brining an original and attention-worthy story to the table.  Pacing, plot structure, and character development are all top notch through and through and the humor, which is often so natural as to appear nearly unintentional, is the icing on the proverbial cake.<br /><br />It is often suggested that DreamWorks tends to release in quantity what Pixar does in quality but every once in a while a DreamWorks production manages to raise the bar for all of the other studios to attempt to follow.  The stars aligned a decade ago when Shrek was released and it would seem the studio has managed to find that magic once again in Kung Fu Panda.gway, surprised by the panda's sudden appearance, designates him the Dragon Warrior and hence Po is immediately in way over his head.

B000IJ79V6|4.0|I got this movie because it's my personal favorite of the Superman movies{and too,the price was real good}!Some say this movie was comical{yes,it has that}but overall,I like this movie better than the 1st movie.And this movie,by far,has the best theme song!I haven't seen the Donner version,but from what I've read,I'm glad I haven't.From what I've read,the blending of scenes{or the scenes in this movie}isn't as good as the Lester version.However,this is NOT the best version of this movie.The best version of SupermanII{as some have said}was the ABC-TV version that was on TV back in the 1980's.That version was mostly a Lester-version movie,with the best Donner scenes in it.THIS is the best version of SupermanII!
0545123275|5.0|As far as I can tell, there are three types of YA books out there: the cheap knock-offs of popular books with only the barest semblance of a plot; the engaging, well-written stories we all enjoy and might remember a few weeks after reading but usually don't; and the ones that slip under your skin and haunt you long after you've put them down. Shiver is definitely of the latter category.<br /><br />Steifvater's writing is quiet, contained, and yet she manages to say so much more with fewer words than most other writers I've come across. Reading Shiver was, at times, akin to reading a long work of poetry. I found it was hard for me to read it in one stretch -- I'd read a few chapters and then put the book aside to absorb what I'd just read before picking it up again. I can't say I enjoyed reading this book...it was, at times, too raw and too painful to be comfortable. But I still loved every bit of it.<br /><br />As some other reviewers have pointed out, the lack of strong, supportive adult characters was unsettling. Grace's parents were just as neglectful of their daughter as Sam's parents were of him...only with a lot less drama and over a much longer stretch of time. But I feel this was intentionally done to show how apart both Grace and Sam stood from those around them...and why they were so connected to one another from the start.<br /><br />If you're looking for something fun and light to read, keep looking. If you are looking for a great story that might make you uncomfortable and will definitely make you think, pick up Shiver. And be prepared for something totally different from most YA books out there.

B002RL7W9W|5.0|This two-piece set is from ESB  and is relatively easy to assemble and fun to play with.  My six-year old did it with some help from me in about 20 minutes.  The two pieces are from the Empire's Hoth attack (but I don't remember either from the movie).<br /><br />The first piece is a small battle station with a gun and radar, manned by a trooper and an officer.  The other piece is a sled speeder similar to the bike speeder from ROJ.  Each piece was different to assemble, and keep our interest.  Because they're so different, they are very versatile to play with; the two pieces play well with both our finished pieces and our box of legos.<br /><br />On a related note, I would recommend introducing kids to Star Wars with ESB: less talky than NH, great beginning scenes on Hoth that catch kids' attention, classic Vadar, the intro of Yoda, the carbonite freezing, and the list goes on.  ESB will hook your kids, and they can fill in the timeline afterward.  This is a great piece to extend the story.  The only downside is that they will be jonesin' for an AT-AT asap.
B000Y9PILI|5.0|Songs for Beginners...Graham Nash's 1st solo album ...is brilliant. It could be the best solo work of any of the CSN&Y members. Each song has deep feeling...real emotion. The writing is passionate...Graham's vocals are lovely...and the contributing musicians are some of the finest players in rock history.  This album is easily in the top 100 ever made.
0446402397|5.0|Not being a big fan of overblown adventure stories or murder mysteries, it must be said that this one is a page turner that wouldn't let me rest. The intro, set in the Ukraine during Stalin's mass murder campaign, is in a class of its own: poignant, chilling and heart wrenching without being overly sentimental or maudlin. It is some of the best prose I've read in quite awhile.  Beyond that, we leap into the shifting sands of the USSR near the end of Stalin's life when our protagonist, an esteemed member of the secret police, is asked by old friends to investigate the disappearance and apparent murder of a young boy. Our hero is so steeped in Soviet propaganda that he blows the incident off. After all, there is no crime in the people's paradise.   But as more children end up missing or found murdered our hero gets drawn into the case which gives his arch rival the opportunity to frame him for treason. This leads to a chilling escapade that takes us across Russia with many a thrilling episode. A couple of the scenes stretch credibility, but it is after all a modern day thriller. One of the interesting aspects of the tale is how it accurately tracks the history and demise of Joseph Stalin using his ironic death as an important plot twist.    Michael D.

B00005Q4CS|2.0|A disturbing fantasy that punishes drug addicts as if they were mass murderers. While very well acted and well written, when all is said and done, this film is a type of anti-drug propaganda that extreme right-wing extremists would be proud of. Reference Riefenstah's Triumph of the Will.  If you like this film, I recommend the Faces of Death series.
0375842209|4.0|I have to say that I don't particularly like the layout of the book with its bold, terse intrusions that seem to be an attempt at some sort of post-modern technique that, in my opinion, detracts from rather than elucidates the story.   That said I did like this book. The grim Reaper as narrator (and even the aforementioned technique) work well when dealing with the evils of the Nazis. This may be particularly instructive as the modern world continues with the old us vs them dialectic.   Zusak's tale brings to mind Gunther Grass' poignant little book \\"Cat and Mouse,\\" with its rendition of boys growing up and coming of age during the Nazi era in Danzig. As much as I liked Grass' book, Zusak's is better in my opinion: broader in scope, characterization and even historical perspective. Where Grass uses the obvious metaphor of the cat toying with the mice until it kills them, Zusak's Is more subtle: the idea perhaps that every life is a book and that in dire times one may have to steal a life.  I've given only four stars not only based on the format, but because I thought some of the dialogue needed a little more work.    Michael D. Edwards, Author of the recently released \\"Royal Ryukian Blues\\" a memoir of Okinawa.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|If you're already familiar with the films of Miyazaki, Ponyo will strike you as being a lot lighter and simple -- feel great fluff.  However, if you're new to Miyazaki and just looking for a good film to watch with your child, you're likely to be blown away.<br /><br />On the one hand, Ponyo is far from Miyazaki's greatest work.  It lacks depth, dramatic tension, and even a comprehensible plot.  A lot of this simple but unique spin on The Little Mermaid simply doesn't make any sense.  Fortunately the stunning characters and their idealic rural/coastal Japanese setting keep you entertained enough so as not to really notice.  This is a beautiful, beautiful film about a sweet boy, a sweet half fish/half girl, and their incredibly sweet childhood love for each other that's more than platonic, less than romantic, and somehow truer than any other love in the world.  The fact that Ponyo's dad lives in an air bubble under the sea, yet must spray himself with water so as not to dry out on land, doesn't seem to matter as much in contrast.  It doesn't even matter so much that, at the end, we really have no idea how Saske loving Ponyo is going to stop the underground well from bringing the moon closer to the world in order to make the tides rise and destroy all of humanity, which her dad planned all along but now wants to stop for no apparent reason(??????).<br /><br />In the end, it was never the plot that really mattered, just the characters.  Ponyo is a charming film that reminds us how magical a world childhood can be, shows us how parents, the elderly, and even neighbors can play a positive role in such a world, and enthralls us in endearing animation all the while.  And, while the starr-studded vocal credits seem entirely unnecessary, they do an excellent job of conveying the voices of this world, particularly Noah Cyrus as Ponyo.<br /><br />Ponyo may lack the depth and epic magnitude of Miyazaki classics like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, but it more than makes up for it in beauty, innocence, and tear-inducing happiness.innocence, and tear-inducing happiness.

1439190275|3.0|I heard one of the fellas from the Atkins Group on a People's Pharmacy radio interview, and my interest was peaked enough to read the book.  I made some dietary changes based very loosly on the book's advice, and here I am more than 3 months later, several pounds lighter.  I decided to cut out as much bread and rice from my diet as feasible. When others are eating sandwiches, I put my meat and cheese on top of a salad, with lots of garnishes, and I am quickly satisfied.  My whole family has tried to cut back on the amount of food we are eating at each meal, and do some gentle exercise AFTER supper, such as walking or biking. I believe that the stabilizing of my glycemic level(by lowering the carbs) has helped a great deal, as well as working off the evening meal calories.  Just be sure to use a good mix of common sense with the book and the diet changes.
1934356476|5.0|Coming from Java, this book was very important for me in filling in a lot of the gaps in understanding Ruby.  \\"Metaprogramming\\" may sound like a topic best saved for expert practitioners, but I think this is important stuff for everyone - you'll actually understand how all of that magic code you see in various modules and libraries works under the covers.

B000F7CMQ8|4.0|Mogambo is great look at 1950's film making. John Ford does his usual beautiful landscapes, Gable his smirks with nod, Ava Gardner totally out there sex with nary a touch and Grace  Kelly in pot boiling wish I could have sex, but it's not nice on screen innocence.      It was a different age, but stories and sexual tension were sometimes played better because they were off screen.      We also get a glimpse of the cultural images of what made men, men and women, women and the then as now existing confusion. I purchased it because I will use it to teach my grandchildren some of my childhood. It is also a helpful piece to see some changes that have not been made. A fun watch if only because acting styles have changed, but still hold!
0312944926|4.0|Title: Digital Fortress    Author: Dan Brown    Genre:  Thriller/Fiction          Summary: When a Japanese genius writes an unbreakable code, he blackmails the code-breaking department of the NSA (National Security Agency) by threatening to release it. The price? Telling the world about translator, a code-breaking machine that can break almost any code. When the head of the code-breaking department tries to turn the situation to his advantage, it all goes terribly wrong.      My opinion of this book: This book had several twists that left you wondering who the real villain is. This book definitely shows that everything is not as it seems. You will not want to put this book down, even after you have finished it. This book will certainly keep you on your toes. This book left me wondering about how much power the government should have.    Recommended for teens and older, as it was mildly inappropriate.  4 out of 4 stars!
006621131X|4.0|I think the title says it all--thinking back on time when two soon-to-be famous artists were just kids, trying a variety of pursuits, putting their lives together, knowing they needed at least some rudimentary form of income to live in New York and pushing themselves to take risks in processing the world around them into art.<br /><br />\\"Just Kids\\" is autobiography, yes, but it skips like a stone across the surface of events. It's also part tribute to Patti Smith's soul mate, Robert Mapplethorpe, and to the bond the two fashioned.  \\"Just Kids\\" focuses on how their individual art forms--poetry and music for Patti, photography for Robert--evolved.  In each of their fields, both artists pushed the envelope.  Patti is enshrined in punk lore for a reason--the musical edge matched the jagged, raw and guttural poetry.  She worked at it. Robert saw things in still life and people that others could not, did not. He pushed all boundaries of taste. \\"Just Kids\\" tracks how the former altar boy's approach to photography developed as he discovered himself.  It's amazing to think that a \\"chance encounter\\" led to their deep personal relationship but that's what New York (or any big city) is probably all about.<br /><br />The writing is atmospheric and light.  Punk scholars and historians, search elsewhere.  There are some evocative tidbits throughout--Patti running into Jimi Hendrix, Patti with Sam Shepard, Patti with Lenny Kaye and hanging out with Todd Rundgren, Jim Carroll, Tom Verlaine, Richard Lloyd and many others.  (If this era of rock is of any interest to you, \\"Just Kids\\" is worth reading for the name-checking alone.) Patti Smith seems to have been at the center of it all but the details are fairly sketchy--and that's just fine.  But \\"Just Kids\\" is about the spirit of their friendship--running off for a day of goofing around at Coney Island--not encyclopedic details.<br /><br />\\"Occasionally I read poetry at a bar, but would spend most of my allotted time sparring with drunken patrons. These experiences did much to sharpen my Johnny Carson repartee but little to advance the communication of poetry. Lenny joined me the first time I played at the West End Bar, where Jack Kerouac and his buddies had once written and drunk, but not necessarily in that order. We made no money, but at the end of the night Jane rewarded us with a great piece of news. We had been asked to open for Phil Ochs at Max's Kansas City in the last days of the year. Lenny Kaye and I would spend both of our December birthdays and New Year's Eve merging poetry and rock and roll.\\"<br /><br />Patti recalls her own career development and recalls as Mapplethorpe's circle of friends, benefactors and fans grows, too.  They were close friends and partners until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989. \\"Just Kids\\" is about that special bond between the two of them.

B001HYY35G|5.0|I listened to this album after thoroughly enjoying \\"Cross.\\" There is not a song I didn't like in \\"Cross\\" and they were all pretty darn good, some are near godly. So I bought this live album and ever since I first listened to it, I have yet to go back to \\"Cross.\\" The songs in \\"A Cross the Universe\\" are more intense and much more enjoyable overall. They did an awesome job remixing them with different tempos and underlying beats. I can't do it justice by writing about it (I simply don't know that much about music to do so). But what I can say is that \\"CROSS\\" IS STILL AN AWESOME ALBUM, BUT WHEN YOU HEAR THE SONGS IN \\"A CROSS THE UNIVERSE,\\" YOU WON'T BE GOING BACK TO \\"CROSS\\" ANYTIME SOON. Some negative things a can say about this purchase is that I think they over used the line from \\"Never Be Alone,\\" \\"TTHHEE PPAARRTTYY\\" could have been better but it's still cool, and I wish they included \\"New Jack\\" and \\"Valentine.\\" Also the DVD is enjoyable but I don't see myself re-viewing it again; but, like I said, it's pretty enjoyable. It's hard to complain about this album bundle, especially with an amazing encore cover of \\"NY Excuse\\" and \\"Master of Puppets!\\"    overall, if you love \\"Cross\\" or Justice then you should totally get this!

If you're a fan of comic books, or graphic novel's, and/or G.N.'s translated into film(like the Batman movies, Sin City, or \\"V\\" for Vendetta, etc.), this is one for you!  Tarantino's filmmaking style lends itself well to this \\"animated adult comic book\\" style! Uma does a typically powerful roll, and well cast as a modern chick superhero with today's C.G.I. realism!  Her sly\\"I know what you're thinking\\" smile is perfectly cast!  A truly fun, sexy, action adventure, trip into the imagination.  A visual Feast!  Sit down to it and expect to have a good time, without any other motivations!
020530902X|5.0|It's a very helpful book to any writer.<br />It will have you taking a closer look at how you write and edit your work. Should you hold the craft of writing dear enough, you'll never write without it. Prepare to realize many of the simple writing mistakes you make every day that, while proper in grammar, have your work reading less intelligent and readable. Those rusty in grammar should find a grammar text book with an extensive glossary to help with the read: only half the book will be discernible to those unfamiliar with the terminology of grammar.<br />The book, while unforgiving of wordiness and self-indulgent writing, offers lessons in small, easy-to-swallow sections so it can be read at just about any pace.
0439023513|2.0|I enjoyed The Hunger Games very much, with its intensely dark dystopian mood and intense action, coupled with interesting ideas of rebellion and the promise of a couple of thrilling sequels.  I waited eagerly for the next book.  I found Catching Fire a bit redundant but extremely cool at the end, and immediately began checking the library site every day to be sure I put a hold on the final book as soon as possible.<br /><br />This book began interestingly, introducing the new setting of District Thirteen and immediately giving insight into the current situation, coupled with rising tensions within the districts.  However, the end dissapointed me intensely.  Collins had been building up to the final climactic challenge between Snow and Katniss quite nicely, but she suddenly cut off the attack and prevented Katniss from ever having her real confrontation with Snow.  Very anti-climactic.  As if that wasn't enough, Collins proceeded to kill Katniss' sister, Prim, without really needing to.  This later became the basis of Katniss' decision to send the captured children of the Capitol to Thirteen's OWN Hunger Games, just to get back at them for what they did.  I was dissapointed by this moral plunge, as I had come to rely on Katniss as a constant throughout the books.  Oh, and then there's Katniss' decision to kill Coin instead of Snow.  A complete fiasco at the end, and a very dissapointing end to a promising series.<br /><br />If you simply HAVE to know how it all ends, then I guess you could get it from the library, but I wouldn't even waste my time on that.  I definetly don't reccomend buying this book.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|When Lost finally wrapped up its final season back in May, the realizatiion of just what the show's creators had managed to accomplish was not immediately apparent.  Lost did not provide a mythology heavy, \\"aha, so that's what it all means\\" resolution that pulled all of the mysteries and plot threads from the prior seasons together in a way that suddenly made everything crystal clear.  No, what this series had accomplished was something much more remarkable.  When the show's title flashed on that solid black background for the final time, the series had come full circle; bringing the audience back to where this amazing journey had started.  Lost's creative team had managed to construct a self-contained story arc that spanned 6 seasons, tackled huge themes, built a complex mythology, provided some of the most memorable and complex characters in the history of the medium and incorporated elements of science fiction and fantasy.  They also did something even more daring and incredible.  They risked critical and fan backlash by ending the series with a finale that appeared to be far too simple for the labrynth of mysteries leading up to it and refused to provide clear cut and easily identifiable answers to those mysteries.  Say what you will about the final season of Lost, (and many have) but the writer's ended things on their terms. By doing so, they created something rarely seen on television:  an ambitous work of art that is built to stand the test of time.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the final season, I won't provide any spoliers regarding the plot.  Things pick up following the detonation of the hydrogen bomb by Juliet at the end of Season 5.  The purpose of this act was to change the past and make it so that Oceanic 815 never crashed on the island and all of the suffering and loss experienced by the survivors could have been avoided.  Right off the bat it appears that the detonation was successful.  We are taken aboard flight 815 in the opening scenes of the first episode, \\"LA X\\" where it appears that the Losties are en route from Sydney to Los Angeles just as they were at the beginning of the series and none of them seem to know each other or have any knowledge of the events that occured prior to the explosion.  But there are some noticable differences.  Jack has a scar on his neck, Charlie has short hair, Desmond is on the plane and we learn that Hurley considers himself the luckiest guy in the world.  What exactly is going on here?  Before we can even begin to theorize on that, the action shifts to the island where it turns out the bomb didn't work.  Instead, the explosion has propelled Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, Sayid, Jin and Juliet from 1977 to the present where they must confront John Locke, or whoever has taken his form, who is recruiting people in an effort to leave the island once and for all.<br /><br />Season 6 jumps back and forth between these two realities (the scenario in which 815 never crashed is referred to as the flash-sideways) as it moves toward the end.  On the island some of the shows key mysteries are answered.  We learn what the numbers mean, why the Losties were brought to the island, the true nature of the island, what the smoke monster is, how Richard Alpert ended up on the island and why he never ages and who the skeletons in the cave from Season 1 are.  All the while, our heroes must decide whether they will join Locke in his attempt to leave or if they will take a leap of faith and stand against him.  Meanwhile, in the flash sideways, we watch as 815 lands safely in Los Angeles and the characters begin to go their separate ways only to find themselves crossing paths with each other again.<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that this is the most complex and challenging season of Lost.  The pacing is considerably slower than in prior seasoons and the epidoses are much more devoted to character development and thematic elements than with the mythology and mysteries.  The result can feel like a season that is disconnected from the prior five, but the ties to the rest of the series are there.  Season 6 explores the larger themes of fate vs. free will, science vs. faith, destiny, redemption, relligion and love that have always been at the forefront of the series.  The flash sideways in particular is rich with these themes as well as the recurring motiff of mirrors.  This is important since the characters do a lot of reflecting on their pasts and their flaws. Events in the flash sideways also mirror those on the island while the season itself mirrors Season 1 in terms of the focus on character and theme.<br /><br />As for the finale, it is a work of sheer beauty and genius.  It is deeply moving and satisfying;  tragic yet hopeful, happy yet sad and most importantly, it provides an ending as well as a beginning.  This is not only the case for the characters, but for the viewers as well since the show encourages us to go back to the start and take the journey all over again because as much as we think we know about the island, the characters and the mysteries, there is still more to be learned.  There will always be more to learn and Lost will always exist for current fans as well as future generations who want to take the journey.  In the end, that's what Lost was always about:  understanding that the answers are not always easily obtainable and that you have to work for them.  And your answers may not be the same as the next person's.  That's quite an accomplishment for any work of art, and Lost was without question a work of art.

6305327084|5.0|This movie is the best thing ever to fly under many peoples cinematic radar. This is a timeless classic.
B002ZG983M|2.0|The problem that I have with Kick-Ass isn't that it is relentlessy violent (albeit in an over the top, almost cartoonish manner), overflowing with profanity or even that one of the main characters is an 11 year old girl who slices and dices crooks and bad guys with a child like sense of glee.  No, what I found to be most disappointing about this big screen adaptation of the graphic novel (which I've never read) is that it is not as darkly funny, satirical, shocking or cool as it thinks it is.  In fact, I was fairly bored with the majority of the movie.  I guess I just don't get it.<br /><br />Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, a typical teenager who thinks that it might be cool to become a costumed crime fighter.  Dave tells us via voice over narration, that he doesn't have any real reason to carry out this plan other than it is a fantasy that he thinks would be fun to play out.  He is not driven by any of the reasons that so frequently occur in comic books.  He doesn't have the need to avenge the death of his parents, he wasn't exposed to any radioactive materials and he is not an angry outcast.  As he tells us, he is pretty much a normal teenager.<br /><br />That is certainly an interesting hook to build the movie around, and I had hope early on that this would make for an engrossing and unique film.  But as it turns out, that is not the case.  Don't get me wrong, Kick-Ass is certainly trying to provoke thought and discussion about subjects such as our youtube obsessed culture and how it can turn anyone into an overnight sensation, and the dangers of living in a fantasy world. But it just never sucks you into the comic book world it so meticulously creates.<br /><br />The perils of severing ties with reality is illustrated in the movie by the presence of a father-daughter crime fighting duo known as Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage in a corny Bat-Man suit) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz).  These two team up with Dave's newly created superhero, Kick-Ass, after they save him from being slaughtered by some very real, very dangerous bad guys.  Cage's Big Daddy is a former cop who has turned his life into a comic book/video game where the goal is to take down the drug kingpin who framed him and sent him to prison which ultimately resulted in his wife's suicide.  It seems that in order to cope with his grief and loss, Cage's character has created a fantasy world where he fights crime.  One of the consequences of his break with reality is that he has pulled his daughter into the abyss with him, turning her into a vicious killing machine.

Cage's Big Daddy is a former cop who has turned his life into a comic book/video game where the goal is to take down the drug kingpin who framed him and sent him to prison which ultimately resulted in his wife's suicide.  It seems that in order to cope with his grief and loss, Cage's character has created a fantasy world where he fights crime.  One of the consequences of his break with reality is that he has pulled his daughter into the abyss with him, turning her into a vicious killing machine.

0792841344|5.0|This edition of Phantasm is better than the more recent release in my opinion. Love the film, love the extra content
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Best book about war (from the soldier's POV) that I've ever read.  Sledge doesn't hold back describing the horrors, the misery, and the waste of war.  Also, the first book I've ever read that mentions the practice, at least some portion of the soldiers engaged in, of 'liberating' gold from the teeth of the dead Japanese.  Most war writers avoid that kind of comment but I think it was one of the most important parts of the book since it makes clear how a savage war affects good men.  He doesn't preach at us.  He has no agenda.  Just tells us what it was like in an honest way, without glorifying or demonizing.
B003O85W3A|5.0|The album is great! Love all the songs. Although I still think the Funeral is better.
B00332GA8I|5.0|I'VE SEEN THIS I S IT TWICE AND LOVED IT AND I'M GLAD KINGSTON LOADED IT ONTO THEIR 2GB FLASH DRIVE, BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR A REVIEW OF THE FLASH DRIVE, NOT THE MOVIE!!! one more thing, does this movie play on a mac, which has no wmp?
B000W44IZW|5.0|This dvd is much beter than my 20 year old vhs tape.  This is still one of my favorite movies.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|I love all three of these films and will enjoy watching them over and over as the years go by.  Looking for the Rat Pack original to add to the collection.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|The most awesome epic series I have ever seen.  I wish we didn't have to wait so long for season 2.  Hell, I'm just glad there will be a season 2!!
B00000ILDF|1.0|First off this film totally undermines everything that happened in Alien 1 and 2.  The biggest crime is the removal of Newt and Hicks in the speedy opening.  The viewer never really gets over their demise and the feeling lingers for the whole movie.  Next is the introduction to a bunch of unsympathetic prisoners who aren't even worth remembering by name.  Charles Dance is the only intriguing chap who is killed before he even begins.  There is very little else to keep to you entertained as the film constists mostly of bald men  running through endless corridors hunted by the cgi glossy looking alien.  Riply has all but given up in this film.There was nothing else left to say at the conclusion of Aliens  anyway.  Fincher took a franchise and completetly ripped out its intestines to make a few bucks and as a result is remembered for directing the most underhanded and useless sequel in recent memory.  I could of forgiven or even liked a sequel like Alien 3 if it was a worthy one.  But you cant treat it's fanbase like idiots and expect praise for it.  For example wouldn't Ripley not have checked the sulaco to make sure there were no eggs left by the Queen before going into hypersleep.  And when we find out she was the one who the facehugger attached to it still doesn't explain how the fire started or at least not cohesively.The alien would have died after attaching to her so how exactly did the fire start.  Poetic licence is being used here.  Carrie Henn's character is ripped apart to make sure an alien isnt inside her even though nobody thinks how Ripley mananged to survive the crash.This is further emphasised because Hicks drowned in his cryotube.  There are too many plotholes and as a result the even more farfetched sequel sprung from this jargon.  Ultimatley Alien 3 is a film I cannot watch again after seeing Alien and Aliens because it wrecks both films for me personally.
6304712499|5.0|Spawn is about a man who gets betrayed and goes down into hell only to recieve superpowers. Now he comes back with a vengeance. The story was pretty well played out and the clown villain was hilarious. The sound was good overall. Spawn is great superhero movie to watch, but the only bad thing is they never made a sequel. I do not know why but I think it is ridiculous.
B002T921DE|4.0|I would rather Blu-Ray or DVD for music compilations instead of CD full of songs already in my library.    I wasn't sure how he was going to pull off a Live Concert to record. The quality and sound is better than I expected.     It isn't over done and he didn't try to create a stage full of dancers and elaborate sets. HE SINGS, SINGS and MORE SINGING.     I would have paid for a seat at this concert.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Robocop is a movie about a cop who gets killed and gets remodeled into a robot, thus becoming Robocop. The story was great, sound was great, and action was great. The Robocop franchise has 3 movies total but the other two are not as good as the first one. The first one is the best in the franchise and the one people should buy.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|In order to really understand Operation Redwing and the men that undertook such a risky endeavor you need to know the intense preparation they underwent.  This book spends a lot of time explaining the training of Seals and why only a small percentage are priveleged to wear the trident.  It takes men with exceptional physical and mental hardening to go where discovery means death.  No exceptions.  Luttrell may not be the best writer and in a sense maybe this account is a little self-serving but it tells it like it is.  No holds barred.  Many years ago I spent time stationed at Coronado when the forerunner of Seals was the UDT *Underwater Demolition Team\\" and I saw first hand the intense training that failed eighty percent.  I would guess that the current Seal training would fail half of those.  Certainly they don't have to be \\"rocket scientists\\" but they do have to think under extreme duress.  This book describes a \\"fight to the death\\" of a team of men and how one man survived because of what can only be call a fluke of culture. The reader is left with little personal information about the other team members and many reviewers found fault with that.  Personally I didn't.  A key element in the tragedy of Operation Redwing is the team's encounter with goatherders.  Kill them or not?  Frankly it wouldn't have made any difference, except that maybe the mission may have been successfully cancelled...which I doubt.  This book was hard to put down and a real testament to the bravery of all special forces members.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Home Alone gets a sequel and the movie is just as good as the original. That is all I have to say.
0380789027|5.0|Excellent book, brilliantly written. Masterfull tales full of a peculiar poignancy delivered with a dark, deft and original prose. Pulses with verve and vivacity.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The first Superman film made and one of the best films ever. The movie has great story, sound, graphics, and action. You gotta experience Superman.
030726999X|5.0|This was a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  While not as complex as the first two books, it was a satisfying read in its own right.  Without giving too much away. I loved the courtroom scenes near the end of the book--for readers who have faithfully followed the journey of Lisbeth Salander, they will be very much appreciated.  It is a shame that we will see no more from Stieg Larsson.
B003M8NGM6|5.0|Matrix Reloaded continues the story of Neo and his friends as they battle the agents, to restore the world. This movie has more action than the first one. So if you are a fan of The Matrix franchise you should get this movie. Blu-ray is the way to go.
0812971825|5.0|A Jewish friend gave me the book with a hearty recommendation. She had read Olive Kitteridge and loved it while I was neutral about that novel, so I was surprised when I found that I couldn't put down ABIDE WITH ME. This rare novel of a clergyman-- privy to the secrets of so many but at a loss to unveil that of his child--felt authentic. I already want to read it again, to see exactly how Strout conjures her magic. I sense that Strout didn't plot the novel to the nth degree,but depended on the muse to help her out as she went along. The ending was satisfying--at once strange, in character, and plausible. I enjoyed the theological discussions, being an admirer of Bonhoeffer, but some readers might feel they go on too long and too admiringly although that is remedied at the end. The portrait of the minister's wife was a marvel! This book would make a marvelous choice for a church book club.

B002E01LTI|3.0|\\"Blade II\\" looks and sounds better now that this movie has been remastered on the BD format. The BD version is missing a title screen and special features. The movie company could've made \\"Blade II\\" even better than it once was. Too bad so sad because it's the movie company's loss.
0545101425|5.0|Alright, so yes this last book of the series was different compare to the First two. The action really begins around page 260 or so. BUT there's other stuff going on, Katniss is making decisions, waiting, making decisions, waiting, fighting, and so on. I think the author really took us on a different journey and believe me when you are done with this book, you will feel hungry for more! That's how i felt, i wanted more, i felt drained, but one thing for sure, I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. This book had a great ending, i cried and believe me you will too.

0547396945|5.0|This is perfect! My son loved this book when we borrowed it from the library but every time we went back to get it, it was out. I'm glad he finally has a copy of his own and that it's in English AND Spanish...maybe he'll be able to learn a little Spanish along the way before they start teaching it in school.
0688152023|5.0|Tired of the jarring and sore joints of the typical American workout, I bought this book.  What is more beautiful and fit than a ballet dancer's body?  I am not disappointed! Trying the exercises on the first day I had it, I broke a sweat in no time at all, and was sore in places I didn't know I had, but it wasn't like soreness I've had with weight work or other routines where I could barely move the next day.  This works!! Already, after 2 weeks, I have some amazing definition in my thighs, which are not bulking but actually slimming down (Yay for that - I hated bulging thighs - leave those for the muscleistas) My goal was to be long and lean, and this is DEFINITELY the workout for that.  It is specific about extending the muscles/body parts being worked on, rather than just achieving a static stretch, which gives the exercises a range that isn't available in other workouts. My next purchase will be the DVD, as there are some vague areas in the book. Beautiful, beautiful!! Thanks, Peter Martins and the wonderful dancers of NYC Ballet Co!!! One suggestion: buy a good diet-for-dancers book to use with this if you are sincere about having a dancer's bod and energy!!
B001UV4XWY|1.0|What a terrible movie! The plot started off great, but things only got worse. It was as if they left off 15-20 minutes at the end of movie. Don't listen to people who gave this movie a positive review. This movie stinks!
B000X3KZVI|5.0|Well... I could review like a normal person... \\"it's a great concert performance, blah blah blah\\".  Let's be honest... I like Mariah Carey cause she sings well and she's hot.  So if you like her music and you wanna see her dancing around in her skimpy outfits this is the way to go.  Plus the I'll Be There cover and One Sweet Day with Boyz II Men were wonderful!!
0439023513|1.0|I usually get my books from the library, with this book, however, I was so anxious and excited to read it, I decided to purchase it. I wish that I had waited out the library's waiting list, for it was not worth even the discounted price. While the first two books of this trilogy were very compelling and absorbing, this book was neither.  As the story progressed, it appeared that the author was just rushing to write something, anything to finish this series.  There were too many gratitious references to bits from the prior books (tracker jackers, mutts) and the storyline that was set up in the second book, meandered and fizzled out quite quickly in this third book.  The book lacks spark and the storyline guts the characters that made the first two books such page turners. This book is a really tortured read.  After reading some of the glowing reviews this book has received here, I wondered if I was sent a different book.  Future readers, buy the first two, but take this book out of the library....save your money for something better.
0131988425|2.0|Many figures, derivations, and concepts in this book are not thoroughly explained, making them difficult to follow.  It is also sparse on good example problems.  This book is obviously written for graduate students who already have a solid grasp of the basics of signal processing and higher level mathematics like Fourier transforms.  If you don't have a solid grasp of these things when you start reading this book, then you are probably going to be very frustrated with it.
0393972844|5.0|Thank you for the quick shipment!  The novel is in great condition and will be a nice edition to my library.
1849162883|4.0|enjoyed this book as much as The Girl Who Kicked Fire and cannot wait to get my \\"Kindle\\" to download the third in the series to read that book.<br /><br />Would recommend a quiet time when you can really get into Dragon as it was hard to put down.

0618918248|5.0|Although hard to get into at first, I was quickly hooked and could not put this book down. The God Delusion is exquisitely written, and Dawkins' arguments are solid and well thought out. It is a book i am sure i will revisit many times in my life.
0439023513|4.0|Food to eat while reading: District 12 Beef Brisket([...])    What a wild ride this series is. To be honest, I am actually relieved to be done with it. Now don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the ride. But the emotional rollercoaster was so swift and stomach-dropping that I am happy to be on solid ground again.     What I liked:    There were so many surprises and twists that I couldn't put the book down. Katniss is so unpredictable that I never know what is going to happen.     Collins is a master at painting the silence behind the words. When she describes what Katniss is experiencing, I feel like my heart is going to explode. It is even more poetic than poetry. Here is an example from page 349:     \\"Dead, but not allowed to die. Alive, but as good as dead. So alone that anyone, anything no matter how loathsome would be welcome. But when I finally have a visitor, it's sweet. Morphling. Coursing through my veins, easing the pain, lightening my body so that is rises back toward the air and rest again on the foam.\\"    The author knows when to show and when to tell. She leaves out or summarizes the unnecessary and I am relieved to read only what is important to Katniss.     Katniss is given freedom by the author to do and say what she wants to. This makes for an interesting and impulsive story.     The ending was hard for me to swallow at first. But the more I think about it, the more fitting it becomes. Collins wove the ending so tightly, that up until the last page I didn't know how things would turn out. Yet, when I think back to the last few chapters, I can see the obvious winding down.     I was so very happy to see Katniss through to the end, if only to give her character some peace. She went through so much irony and unfair agony that I was comforted to see her settled.     The themes of war & peace, and the cycle of human society are classic. Collins drives them home with Katniss, a character so poignant and heartrending who isnpires us to make a difference in our own circle of influence.     What I was unsure of:    The violence and death. I know they are a part of war and defending oneself. But with Katniss, there seemed to be a disconnect from humanity along the way. The casualties who got in her way were bothersome to me, not to mention the innocent sufferers of the war, the children .    I think Katniss could have survived without either Gale or Peeta. I know that some would argue that she is the ultimate strong female character, but I think a woman can be strong and still want to have a husband and a home.
157912626X|4.0|Agatha Christie novel's always seem to just fly by, not matter their length. I am fairly certain, though, that The Body in the Library is Christie's shortest novel. As a result, it's an especially quick and quickly-paced read, with the plot taking whip-sharp turns in each chapter. But despite the novel's tortuousness, it does not lack at all for neat logic and a satisfying denouement. In fact, this is an extremely satisfying mystery, complete with a complex crime, acute psychological observations and characterizations, and a creative crime solving from Miss Marple. This novel served as sort of an introduction to Agatha Christie's mysteries, and I'm sure that it would be an excellent read for any of her readers, new or old.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers never disappoint us. They keep cranking out awesome music, without regard to the trendy pop radio.  This album in unique and each song holds you, nice flow to the tracks too.  Perfection.
0439023483|5.0|A friend recommended THE HUNGER GAMES to me about a year ago, but I held off on reading it because the premise was kind of morbid. I finally decided to pick it up, and I read it in about a day and a half. I couldn't put it down! I really became attached to the characters, especially Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch. I couldn't wait to read Catching Fire when I was done!
B000VD9MG4|5.0|Why is everyone hating on this movie? It's a awesome movie. This is a horror movie that i can watch again and again.    For the Idiots out there that do not know the definition of horror, please look it up. You will find that it means something ugly,disagreeable, shocking and frightful etc. All you haters need to go back to watching \\"little house on the prairie\\" since you can't watch a horror movie. So there some sex scenes, so what. Try having sex with your wife with the lights on, you'll find the same horror in that as you will in the movie.
0786838655|5.0|This was recommended to me by a few of my students. I really enjoyed the story- I've always liked Greek Mythology so I found Rick Riordan's twist on it really entertaining. I think if you like Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl, you'll love Percy Jackson!
B000PTYUQG|4.0|sound is better than ever, if you dont ear difference is a problem of equipement, i already have the original jacket edition and this is superior in sound, like the other people im in trouble with sony, if you purchase this item, you are a serious collector , why dont ask for more money but give a complete libreto and info, this is the only problem with this edition,dont hesitate in buy these cds, only the ballets cost more in separate cds
0399156577|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I love Nora, and really appreciate her stories that have an actual story line and not just 2 people meet, fall in love... This book has a great storyline. The problem I found is that it was awkward. Some of the things the characters say just didn't make sense. I don't know if it was a new style of writing, or if it just wasn't edited well, but it was confusing. I'd have to stop and read the sentence a few times before I figured out what they were talking about. The story moved slowly, and while I found the dog training and rescue scenes interesting, there were too many of them. A good Nora read, but not totally memorable.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This review is a response to the several alarming reviews that claim this series is inaccurate and that the violence of American marines towards the Japanese has been exaggerated or flat out made up.  Anyone who is making these claims has not studied the Pacific theater of World War II.  It was extremely violent and racism played a huge part in motivating that violence on both sides.  Any veteran of this war will tell you this. E.B. Sledge says as much in his book \\"With the Old Breed\\", one of the books this series is based on.  Entire books are based on the racial aspect of this part of the war:  \\"War Without Mercy\\" to name one.  To try and sanitize the Pacific war and turn it into a clear-cut black-and-white good vs. evil interpretation is an insult to everyone who fought there.  Some also claim that Japanese atrocities are covered up by this series.  Not true.  In the very first episode we see American bodies disrespectfully mutilated by the Japanese.  On Okinawa we see the Japanese use civilians as shields or suicide bombers in their attacks.  The goal of the makers of this series was to explore what war can make good people do, and the price they pay for fighting it.  The series is excellent in that respect.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|...i've been wanting these in a collection. i had a few of them as individual dvds, but now it's good to have them all collected. not all of these are top notch movies, but it is a good collection. the extra dvd is a little interesting, but i'm not that kind of fan. watching an interview with those 5 people wasn't that interesting to me. anyway, highly recommended if you like star trek with the original crew. then again, why would someone be looking this collection up on amazon if said person wasn't already a fan of star trek and/or wasn't thinking of buying for a star trek fan? i think this would be an odd purchase for someone that knew nothing of star trek. HA
0307269981|2.0|For whatever reason, someone long time ago said it was ill to speak of the dead. However, one cannot help to think that the reason that the Girl trilogy has become a worldwide success is because Larsson did die. It was a tragedy, struck down in his prime, and anything else that the publisher could come up with to sell these novels. I didn't know the man, but I am sure that he was a good man. From what his biography says he fought Nazis in Sweden. Good for him and good for Sweden.<br /><br />However, none of that translates into being a good author. Death has a way of making the bad not seem so bad anymore. When the guy that was mean and never had a nice word to say to anyone drops dead he quickly becomes a better man. The same goes for authors. Most of us did not know Larsson, but when we read his books and read the dust jacket we are convinced that he was a good man and therefore a good author. Death has made Larsson an immediate literary sensation.<br /><br />According to the website that was dedicated to him, Larsson wrote these novels for himself. It was a way to kill time and shake off the day. Maybe the general public was never supposed to see these novels. We will never know. But let's say that for the sake of argument he was going to try and get them published. I think that they would still be widely popular. Why do I think this even though I think the trilogy is subpar? To quote H.L. Mencken \\"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.\\"<br /><br /> It's true.<br /><br />Fire is no better than the novel that preceded it.  Why should it be? The story goes that all three novels in the series were taken from his computer after he died and then published. It's possible; it has happened in the past. John Kennedy Toole wrote A Confederacy of Dunces. It was only after he committed suicide that his mother found the novel. Long story short- The novel was published and he, Toole, won a Pulitzer.<br /><br /> However, there are differences between the two, not the least being that Fire is supposed to be a mystery. Dunces is a good read. It has an edge; a bite even. Most importantly, Dunces had an editor. Fire, like the novel that follows it and precedes it, was clearly printed as it was found.<br /><br /> At times Fire reads like a shopping list. At other times it reads like a memo without a letterhead. Larsson could never decided if he was writing a police procedural novel or something else entirely. There are too many directions that Larsson has tried to take in Fire and none of them seem to work.<br /><br />Throughout most of the novel Larsson is busy telling us how great Salander is at everything or he is telling us how adamant Blomkvist is about clearing Salander's name or he is busy telling us in detail about the computers used in the novel. This is another problem with the novel; Larsson never shows the reader a thing instead he tells us everything. It gets old quick.<br /><br />The only attempted hook is the repeated hints of what life was like for Salander before the \\"evil\\" started. I know that there are people out there that still want to read this trilogy so I do not want to give anything away, but when we do learn what the evil is and how it fits in the novel it comes off as cheap. It's a cute little tactic on Larsson's part that fails miserably and reeks of deus ex machina.<br /><br /> I have always been a firm believer that everything has its place.  Some people love the Twilight novels, some people don't. Other people think that Jane Austen is the best writer ever and others do not. The point is that novels like this one, and the other novels in this genre, are for entertainment. Most people don't want to think when they are reading a novel. It's not why they cracked the book open. They want to stop thinking for a chapter or two a day. Others who are looking for a well-written mystery, a mystery that will make you think and leave you guessing, should look elsewhere.hat Fire is supposed to be a mystery. Dunces is a good read.

It's not why they cracked the book open. They want to stop thinking for a chapter or two a day. Others who are looking for a well-written mystery, a mystery that will make you think and leave you guessing, should look elsewhere.
B003XU02QG|2.0|I am always happy to see a new movie about Rome but like just about every other Roman movie this was a disapointment.  The way modern movies portray the Roman Army (Legions) is completely ridiculous and unrealistic.  With the ease that whole Roman Legions and Cohorts are dispatched how was it that Rome conquered most of the known world from Britain in the north to Persia and Saudi Arabia in the east and even regularly trading with China and India?    This movie is a mishmash of previous stories/events about the Legions most notably Teutoburg Forest of which this is almost a direct copy and the disproven legend of the Legio Nine Hispania being destroyed in northern Britain.  The one bright spot is that the weapons and armor are among the most accurate that I have seen in a movie about the Legions.  Otherwise this is a horrible inaccurate movie that tries to make up for it by having copious ammounts of over the top gore.    I won't go into more history lessons but suffice it to say if you know anything about history and especially the Roman Empire you will be sorely dissapointed in this movie.
B003MX5P20|3.0|I must be fair by saying that I'm not really an \\"Enrique fan\\" as such... but I got this CD because I'm a HUGE Juan Luis Guerra fan and \\"Cuando Me Enamoro\\" is a duet, which was not produced on JLG's most recent album \\"A son de Guerra\\".  I have listened to Euphoria entirely and it's okay... I LOVE the JLG duet as well as \\"I like it\\" with Pitbull.  That's a GREAT song to blast very loudly :-)  The rest isn't bad, but I'm not in love.  For me though, it was worth the purchase.  Happy listening.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Believer or unbeliever should watch it to see how He died for our sins. It is a sysmbol of His love for us. It made us not wanting do bad stuffs but to repent the sins. When you see it, you probably weep and look back to the terribly things you did in past
B000002J1L|4.0|I've got the 2007 issue of this album. On first listen I was going to give it 85/100, but on second listen I knocked it down to 82.5/100. The music ranges from pleasant to rock, but is always melodic. Lyrics create word pictures and aren't of the verse/chorus/verse variety. Album length 39:33.      The best songs \\"[.]\\":    The musical box - album opener, running to 10:29 minutes in length. Intro features an exotic stringed instrument. Sensual vocals, dual acoustic guitar....sort of like what Iron Maiden would do later on their song \\"The clansman\\". Also features the flute or some such. Song gets a bit like something from The Animals or Queen at times. Drumming is solid at times. Pleasant sounding at times and rock sounding at other times. Lyrics feature a nursery rhyme.    For absent friends - second track on the album. 1:47 long. Pleasant vocals and dual acoustic guitar. Has backing vocals. Maybe a tad Beatle-esque.       The best song on second listen \\">[.]\\":    Harold the barrel - 3:00.  Jaunty piano track. Solid drumming. Electric guitar. Has pleasant parts.       The rest, in album order:    The return of the giant hogweed - 8:09. Weird synth sound for the intro. Keyboard functions a bit like the guitar in a heavy metal band. A rock song but it has quiet bits. Vocals remind me of Bon Scott (AC/DC). Interesting piano note melody. Violins? Has electric guitar. Outro has intense, galloping drums.    Seven stones - 5:08.  Has some synth or actual wood wind instruments...a piccolo, perhaps?  Gentle electric guitar at times. Some solid drumming, keyboard or organ. Nice backing vocals at times...by Peter Gabriel?    Harlequin - 2:55.  Pleasant acoustic guitar (x2) piece. Pleasant (overdubbed?) multi-vocals. Some guitar parts remind me of the song \\"Love the one you're with\\".  Nice lead guitar melodies at times...one other part is also familiar...bit Crosby, Stills and Nash?    The fountain of Salmacis - 8:01. Maybe a sort of Bachian harpsichord type intro. Symphonic elements...e.g. drums and cymbals etc.  Noticeable bass playing. Delicate guitar playing. If you like Peter Gabriel's singing...there's more of him to go around in this song...i.e. he's overdubbed. Guitar solo on electric guitar. Also features organ, flute, rock drumming, cymbals and a female choir at times. Organ solo and a guitar solo for the outro. Lyrically there is some sort of story going on here but it washes over me.       Recommendations:      Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation. There best album up to and including this one. Strong Bee Gees influence.     Genesis - Trespass. Generally pleasant album...you could easily fall asleep listening to it! Final track - \\"The knife\\" - is quite heavy metal for the time.    King Crimson - In the court of the Crimson King. For the title track, especially, which is a classic I've only recently discovered.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit Proof Fence starts out near Perth, Australia in an area called Jigalong in the 1930s. It begins with an Aborigine woman telling a story about her family members as you see a scene of local aborigines tracking animals in the Australian wilderness. Off in the distance, you see two white men watching these children.  They try to hide the children, but it is too late. It then shifts to a scene in a city with a man and his secretary and the names of the Aborigine children come across his desk. This man is Mr. Neville, the \\"Protector of Aborigines\\" and is put in place due to new legislation regarding Aborigines as of 1931. The 3 children (Molly, Gracie, Daisy) that Mr. Neville approves are set to be placed into camps because they are considered what he refers to as \\"half-castes.\\" This means that the child has one Aborigine parent and one white parent. After the order to gather these 3 children is signed, the police officer returns to Jigalong and forcibly removes the children from their families to take them to one of these special camps. At the camp, the goal appears to be to integrate them into white culture and society and teach them the ways of white society while abandoning all of their original traditions including their native language. The camp is located at a place called Moore River and most of the children will be sent to become servants for white people after they reach a certain age.         Even more disturbing is a scene where Mr. Neville is showing a presentation to a group of white people where he talks about how breeding can breed out the Aborigine traits and they will look white. All of this is based on a premise that the Aborigines must be protected because they are somehow dangerous to themselves.  Shortly after being in the camp, the 3 girls run away when the other girls are going to church one day. It is during a rainstorm so they wouldn't leave tracks.  Even with another Aborigine tracker, the police are having a hard time finding the girls as they try to find their way home along a 1500mile fence called the \\"Rabbit Proof Fence.\\"  Mr. Neville ends up spreading some false rumors about Gracie's mother waiting for her in a town so she ends up looking for her there. This allows her to become captured so the other 2 girls continue on their journey. When the 2 girls get close to their home town, the police officer is waiting for them but is scared off by their family as they were chanting and holding sticks. They end up meeting up with their family at this point in time. At the end of the movie, footage is shown where the 2 girls are now grown up and Molly talks about how her own children were captured and she only got 1 of the 2 back by traveling along the fence again.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|I've got the 2004 release of this album with the bonus tracks, but the cover on my cd is the orange one, featuring the weird cat and mouse. This is the second time I've taken this album out for a couple of spins...took it out again so I could write this review. Generally I thought of this as an 8/10 kind of album, but this latest time I've listened to it, I found myself getting more out of some songs on second listen. It's my impression that this album gets bad comments from Megadeth's thrash metal fans. From my point of view, if this was an album by a hard rock band (instead of one from pioneers of thrash metal), this album would be better regarded. Which is a pity.        I'd describe the album as having some old school metal type of songs but with a more modern sound to it and with a mainstream bent. There is some heavy metal on this album but there is experimentation in arrangement too. E.g. you can hear violins, keyboards and acoustic guitar on some tracks. Every song on this album is at least interesting. There is really good drumming throughout. If you like metal albums with variety and don't mind it melodic, smooth and mid-tempo, this album will suit. With the bonus songs the album runs to 66:47 minutes long. The four bonus tracks make up 13:57 of that time. I wouldn't call the bonus tracks interesting enough to seek out this particular version of the album.        Lead singer/guitarist Dave Mustaine seems apologetic about this album in the sleeve notes. He calls \\"Crush 'em\\" \\"a disco song\\"! Way to go Dave! Perhaps this attitude can be explained by the stick he had to take over this album...on the sleeve notes he says that:    \\"I could have put this out under a different name and many people would have loved it. People who bought it because they expected a Megadeth record of metal songs and didn't get it wouldn't be upset with me. People who loved loved those type of songs wouldn't be scared off by the name Megadeth. Oh well, live and learn...    This record consists of many great pop songs that may or may not ever receive the recognition that they deserve, but I know that I gave it my very best. And that is good enough for me.    Love and bruises, Dave Mustaine.\\"    Mustaine also mentions KISS' \\"I was made for loving you\\" disparagingly. That's one of my favourite KISS songs! As if to compensate for having a song called \\"Prince of Darkness\\" on this album, Dave thanks God...twice...on the end credits of the sleeve notes.      The Classic song \\"//\\":       Prince of Darkness - a bona fide classic...the only Megadeth song I would put in the same league as the very best songs by their arch rival Metallica. Musically and lyrically, this song is a brilliant piece of theatre. It has a cool drum tone and beats as well as bass. Features violins, I think. Has a pounding guitar riff at times and eerie, xylophone type sounds...like a child's musical instrumental. The outro is smashing too.      The terrific songs \\"/\\":      Crush 'em - for me, this isn't a disco song! It's a 1980s style stadium anthem rocker. It has a short organ solo intro. The bass has a really boogie vibe to it, which I like (and which may explain why Dave thinks of this as a 'disco' song!). The chorus is of the sing-along kind and it has anthemic backing vocals too. A catchy, fist pumping stadium rocker. The guitar has a  \\"Turn me loose\\" vibe to it too.    Enter the arena - this song gets a small tick from me...you can consider it the prelude to \\"Crush 'em\\". It runs 43 seconds long. Has a cool, open riff, in the \\"Turn me loose\\" mould. An anthemic/motivational type song...it sounds like there is a crowd in an arena singing along to this. Has handclaps.    Wanderlust - I gave this song a reasonable sized tick on my second listen...unmarked first time around (actually, I gave this song a small tick or something the first time I made notes on this album...very many months before I did it again this time). Has a deep drum beat and features perhaps Dave's best singing voice. Interesting guitar notes at the start and nice guitar notes later...perhaps on a steel string acoustic guitar.  Bass guitar also sounds interesting. I like the eerie sounding parts of this song. Bit of a Bon Jovi vibe to the song (maybe sorta like \\"Wanted dead or alive\\"). I'm over Bon Jovi now, so the preceding comment is meant as a compliment...i.e. the kind of Bon Jovi I might actually like.      Next best \\"(.)\\":    Breadline - has an electronic noise intro and Dave works on lead. Sort of an an indie rock vibe to this song, but with mainstream appeal. It's catchy in other words...you can sing along to the chorus. Has synthesiser, smooth vocals and riffing.    The doctor is calling - \\"[.]\\". A theatrical, melodic, mid-tempo track with interesting guitar notes at the start. Has a Black Sabbath type riff. You get to hear the doctor of the title in this song. SImilar theme to Metallica's classic \\"Welcome home (sanitarium)\\".       Next best, on second listen \\">[.]\\":    Insomnia - grating, synthy guitar rhythm. Good riffing and backing vocals. Violins?  There is a \\"I love the way you move\\" vibe re the rhythm and dampened riff at times.     I'll be there - jarring/clangy guitar at the start, then synth, pretty lead guitar, before the rock riffing starts. Before then you have a dance music feel, re the beat and rhythm. Has a sort of Christian rock which doesn't suck vibe to it...the lyrics have a positive aspect to them. Backing vocals a bit in the U2 vein, as well as SImple Minds, for their song \\"Alive and kicking\\".     Ecstasy - pretty/poppy lead guitar notes...acoustic guitar, I think. A European flavour to this. Features keyboard, bass, rock riffing parts, lead guitar and a catchy chorus. My first lot of notes for this album questions whether a part of this song is similar to \\"Train of consequences\\". It's been a while since I've listened to Megadeth's atomic mushroom compilation, so I'm not sure if this impression still holds.     Time: the beginning - slower song. Acoustic guitar strumming...like a mellower \\"Wonderwall\\" (Oasis). Steel string acoustic guitar. Pink Floydy soulful, bluesy lead guitar solo. Violins appear later.    Time: the end - heavy metal track, rock riff and a nice big drum sound. Some sounds reference \\"Prince of Darkness\\". Has a lead guitar solo...maybe good enough to include in a list of mine on this topic. Has some nice melodies at the end, including a pretty, subtle one.      The rest and bonus tracks:    Seven - Pearl Jammy intro then classic old school riffing...Deep Purple style. My first lot of notes state that the intro vocals remind me of Pearl Jam's \\"Even flow\\" and that this is a good groove rock song. Tough and interesting drumming. Cool drumming from 2:30 minutes plus. Cool bass playing at 2:38.  Heavy metal/bluesy lead guitar solo features. Guitar sounds staticky at the end? A candidate for a list of mine on the songs with the best drumming elelments. When I first made notes on this album I gave this song a big dot...putting it on a par with \\"Crush 'em\\". So, it seems the songs I like/don't like on this album ebb and flow...I liked more song after pulling this album out more than a year later, perhaps.     Insomnia - (bonus track) Oriental and Latin touches in the intro? My original notes for this song states that the intro is Beatle-esque/George Harrison-y...that impression must have slipped between listens! Gets heavy later but does feature violins. The sound is more intense sometimes than for the original version.    Breadline - (bonus track) Nice guitar work...lead guitar etc. Synthesiser has a touch of UFOs about them...as does the original version.    Crush 'em - (bonus track) intro sort of references or is redolent of songs such as \\"Creep\\" (Radiohead), \\"Numb\\" (U2) and \\"Owner of a lonely heart\\" (Yes). Not very interesting for the most part but does get into a groove later. Develops a bit of a \\"Buffalo gals\\" (Malcolm McLaren) beat later and other hip-hop beats at times.  Personallythese bonus tracks aren't essential for me...I can leave them.       Recommendations:    Metallica - ReLoad. My favourite Metallica track. If you listened to 'real' heavy metal fans you wouldn't have thought about buying \\"Risk\\"...the same goes for \\"ReLoad\\". Both are great albums...just not thrash metal.    Black Sabbath - Master of reality; Paranoid; Never say die! Sabotage.

Kurt Russell's over-the-top turn as outlaw and former Special Forces war hero sent him into the brutal, converted prison of Manhattan to rescue the President from a plane crash.  Oh, and Plissken has a bomb in his gut set to go off in 24 hours if his mission fails.  You know the drill by now.  By the numbers and from the mind of John Carpenter.  A no frills Blu-ray edition.  Where are the extras?  How come no commentary from Carpenter and Russell?  Not enough bucks to make 'em talk?
B000BF0D9M|5.0|How can someone review a CD without listening to it??  I'm a Jesse Cook fan for over 15+ years and he never ceases to amaze me.  I have every one of his CDs and love every one!!!  His newest CD \\"Rumba Foundation\\" is his best ever, but every song on this compilation is of course, his best songs.  This CD set would be the best one to buy for someone who hasn't really heard him before, it is a wonderful range of songs through his earlier sets and it will not cease to please the listener. I highly recommend this to a new fan of Jesse Cook!!!
B000Q7ZNDG|4.0|William Shakespeare is proving himself a damn fine screenwriter who continues to dazzle us with his extraordinary wordsmithing and deep understanding of human ambition and foibles.  Kenneth Branagh stars as Hamlet.  He also adapted and directed this beautifully realized version that's set in the 19th century world.  Quite different from Lawrence Olivier's 1944 film, this 1996 version of the timeless tale of sex, murder, ghosts, corruption and revenge is set in lavishly mirrored, gilded interiors.  Along with Branagh, the cast includes, Julie Christie, Kate Winslett, Derek Jacobi, Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Charlton Heston and others.  Shot in 65mm film and exhibited in Panavision Super 70, the glory of the ravishing hi-def disc is a site to behold.  This is the definitive film adaptation of Shakespeare's longest (4 hours), and perhaps greatest, play.  \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\\"  Thankfully for us.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Take some of the most extreme liberal hack actors -- Danny Glover, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson -- the director of the liberal \\"disaster\\" film \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" (both in genre and boxoffice, as well as in critical acclaim), add liberal cliches and platitudes for a script, stir in CG effects that are nonsensical (a car driving unimpededly right through the concrete columns of a crumbling building, and a plane flying unimpededly through tons of falling rubble from 2 collapsing skyscrapers) and you have this trite disaster of a film. The cast and crew made its propaganda intent predictable,I only watched it for free on satellite to see Amanda Peet, who came out unscathed in all senses, but I hope she avoids the next liberal disaster/propaganda film: which will probably try to scare people to believe that the world will end if OBama is not reelected, when the real disaster is what he has done to our country already.
B001KP2J3U|3.0|Perhaps the fictional characterization that dominates most people's memories of Ustinov is his take on Agatha Christie's Inspector Poirot.<br /><br />The debut and best of his several incarnations of the fussy Belgian sleuth is here in the star-studded DEATH ON THE NILE.  Can he identify the killer of a newlywed found murdered during a cruise of elegant vacationers before the ship of clues docks?<br /><br />When Rosalind Hicks, author Christie's daughter fist saw actor Ustinov, she said, \\"That's not Poirot.\\"  Ustinov replied, \\"It is now, my dear.\\"  From MGM/Anchor Bay.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Mixed reviews did not bode well for this terrific little gem that lives up to the graphic novel and delivers an unvarnished, unfiltered take on the whole super hero syndrome in life and art.  Profane and violent, here's what happens when you don a mail-order wetsuit and set out to fight crime.  It gets painful and bloody fast as certain death beckons.  And then you are saved by Big Daddy and Hit Girl -- a disturbed comic artist father, and adolescent daughter who are fearless, crazier than you and superbly trained in lethal martial arts.  Good and evil have their showdown in a satisfying battle that for once lives up to the title.  No doubt there's meaning here, but I'm still working it out.  Not for all tastes.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|I heard this album while I was in the Air Force.  I heard \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" play on the radio.  I was wondering what Pink Floyd would do to follow up on \\"The Wall\\" album, so when I went out to buy the new album of \\"The Final Cut\\", I was greatly disappointed.  It sounded so personal.  Kinda angry, and bitter, and with much more emphasis on words, where the music behind it offered very little to what we would expect of a Pink Floyd album.  This is just Roger Waters pouring his heart out about his father's death in World War II.  He shared a little of that on \\"The Wall\\" album, but he really expressed his bitterness on this album.  I'm surprised Gilmour, Wright, and Mason even allowed themselves to call this a Pink Floyd album.  Because, it is Roger Waters all the way.<br /><br />This album, of course, shot right up to Number One on the Billboard charts, but only because we had high expectations of another great album to follow the super successful album of \\"The Wall\\".<br /><br />Well anyway, I got to enjoy just a few single tracks from this album, and only if I shuffled them with other songs from 1983.  They were part of my personal soundtrack of my Air Force party life that I was enjoying at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii.  I guess the three biggest songs from this album were \\"Your Possible Pasts\\", \\"A Hero's Return\\", and \\"Not Now John.\\"<br /><br />But, just recently, I found this CD used, and very cheap, so I bought it again and brought it home to give it another chance.  I haven't played this album in it's entirety for more than 25 years, so it was almost refreshing because I was aware of those few tracks that I mentioned, but what caught me by surprise is that they added a bonus track.  I already had the single of \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\". That was only heard in the movie of \\"Pink Floyd The Wall\\".  Now it has been applied to \\"The Final Cut\\" album and sieged into the middle of side one.  That made all of side one so much more interesting to listen to.  I am actually glad that I bought this CD, even though I bought it used.  So, when did they actually decide to put \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" on this album?  Anyway, I'm glad they did.<br /><br />To be honest, I really don't care too much for side two of this album, but who knows, maybe in another 25 years, that may grow on me too.bought this CD, even though I bought it used.

B001ECQ6E2|3.0|Adapted from Henryk Sienkiewicz's best-selling novel, MGM's religious epic cost an astounding $7 million 1950 dollars and went on to be the top MGM money-maker since GONE WITH THE WIND.  Now in a Blu-ray transfer from pristine elements, it looks better on a hi-def home theater screen than it did during its theatrical road show!<br /><br />Veteran filmmaker Mervyn LeRoy directs this reserved, sometimes talky favorite with a cautious but confident hand.<br /><br />Ustinov is a pudgy Nero in this well-known and beloved story of early Christianity.  Nero frets over the infection of Rome by this new cult.  The horrors of the coliseum and the burning of Rome are the main features.  Nothing worked as well in the Hollywood of the 50s as a somber Christian message with lots of implied sex and torture<br /><br />Handsome Robert Taylor is Marcus Vinicius, commander of Rome's 14th Legion.  He loves Lygia (Deborah Kerr), a believer of the outlawed Christian sect.  But it's Peter Ustinov Nero who steals every scene he's in.  Wrapped in purple petulance, he is a simpering, impulsive, mentally ill child-man. The fates of these three disparate figures -- Marcus, Lygia and Nero -- are entwined in the fall of Rome and the hope of a new idea that has yet to take hold.  Here's old school filmmaking at its best.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Whether or not you agree with Michael Moore's opinions, his movies are always worth seeing and Capitalism: A Love Story is no exception. Going in, you have to realize that Moore has an agenda and his goal is to persuade you to see his vision. He does this primarily with his creative use of the camera, dramatic music, and showing heart wrenching scenes of despair. What makes him a good filmmaker is that he also digs deeper into the issues. While some of these issues are well known (1% of the world having most of the wealth, record corporate earnings partly achieved by massive layoffs, stagnation of wages), further issues such as the poor wages of airline pilots, credit default swaps, and company insurance policies on their employees while listing themselves as the beneficiary are far more disturbing. Moore plays both the political card and morality card to the hilt throughout, especially with his anti-George Bush stance. The examples of justice such as the Chicago factory workers fighting to get the money owed to them when their company closed provide a nice touch and show what can happen when you unite and fight for what's right. Also on display is the usual Michael Moore ridiculousness (armored car and citizens arrest scenes) that always drops his movies down a notch from a true documentary. All told, watch the movie and remember that it's just that. If you want a fair documentary, watch Frontline.
B000KJU182|5.0|With a masterful screenplay adaptation and beautiful direction by Peter Ustinov, Herman Melville's last novel, published after his death, became Terence Stamp's astonishing acting debut.<br /><br />In fact, Ustinov also produced and plays the part of kindly Captain Vere.<br /><br />On the surface, this powerful moral story questions the strict military code when it brushes up against a plea for human compassion.  But is it really about the balance of law with justice?  Can there even be justice without mercy?<br /><br />The year is 1797.  Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) is a young sailor on a merchant ship with the name \\"Rights of Man\\" emblazoned on its hull.  He is drafted onto the HMS Avenger, a British fighting ship on the track of the French navy.  Young Billy is an innocent.  His fellows respond to his naïve charm and gentle kindness.  That is, everyone but John Claggert, Master d'Arms (Robert Ryan).  Claggert is a sadist who delights in harsh punishment for even minor offenses.  Though he despises Billy, he too is drawn to Billy.  Claggert hates this weakness of his soul.  He suppresses these last glimmers of human feeling and takes his fury and hatred out on Billy, aiming to destroy him.<br /><br />Billy is a kind of classic Christ story.  Evil is very real as it manifests itself in Claggert.  Ustinov's Captain Vere is the mirror image of Claggert.<br /><br />Stamp is remarkable as young Billy.  His minimalist, understated performance earned him an Academy Award© nomination.<br /><br />But it is Ustinov's vision and control over this production that makes it what it is: an extraordinary meditation on good, evil and the human condition.  See this little-known, timeless, film and understand why Ustinov is an artist and a genius.  On the commentary track, Stamp talks about his memories of making his film debut and his subsequent, sudden fame and career in a lively conversation with Steven Soderbergh.  From Warner Home Video.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is the best drama on television, if not the best show period. Yes, I'd even put it over Breaking Bad. Season 4 is its best season yet which is saying a lot since each season has been excellent. The Dexter character certainly hasn't mellowed with fatherhood as he continues to kill for justice. A lot of twists this season as Dexter continues to battle his demons while trying to be a good father and husband. There's also major character development with Debra and a workplace romance that lasts throughout the season. Nearly every episode ends with a cliffhanger. This is great drama, on the level of prime Sopranos. Also worth noting is that John Lithgow did an excellent job as special guest star this season, better than Jimmy Smits in Season 3. I don't want to give away too much but this was an amazing season. If you haven't discovered Dexter, there's no better time than now. If you have Netflix, you could watch the first 2 seasons online for free through your computer, Xbox 360, or Roku. Season 5 starts September 26. Watch it once and you'll be hooked.
B0036TGSRG|4.0|This controversial thriller and murder mystery implies that a certain former British prime minister had a very big, explosive secret.  Some readers of the Robert Harris novel think it's based on true events.  Whatever you think of Roman Polanski, his film adaptation does nothing to remove the aura of a real life secret exposed.  This is old school filmmaking at it's best.  Ewan McGregor is a ghostwriter assigned to go to an isolated estate along New England's east coast and write the memoirs of the secluded Adam Lang (Pierce Bronson).  The ambitious writer is quickly seduced by the power of sex and politics as the shocking story he uncovers becomes deadly.  I liked this solid suspenser that many film goers overlooked.<br /><br />As of this writing, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair autobiography was just released.  It's VERY interesting reading the reviews and interviews with Blair and then seeing this roman a clef that seems, in many ways, more truth than fiction.
B0000691TJ|4.0|Although the Ramones' 1985 album Too Tough to Die is considered by some to be a return to their roots (ie....the first four albums), it falls a little short of those tremendous releases. The first six tracks are killer with the high spots being the mid-tempo \\"I'm Not Afraid of Life\\", the joyous instrumental \\"Durango 95\\", and the title track. The next four songs are either too poppy (\\"Howling At The Moon\\", \\"Chasing The Night\\") or too dated (\\"Planet Earth 1988\\" and not just because of the title). The record redeems itself near the end with the wicked \\"Endless Vacation\\" and \\"Humankind\\". The expanded version nearly doubles the original release and brings the album up a notch with several demos, a few of the original tracks with Dee Dee Ramone singing lead, and a very good version of the Rolling Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man\\".  While this is no Rocket to Russia, Too Tough to Die is one of the Ramones' better albums.

0374158460|1.0|I've been teaching college literature for thirty years and I've had more than 150 short stories published, mostly in literary magazines. I preorded FREEDOM because i read about it in TIME. I probably read forty novels a year and when I start one I don't like, I stop reading it. After 130 pages of FREEDOM I just couldn't read any more. His characters are all, in some way, morally weak and dislikeable. If any of his characters moved next door to me, after I got to know them I would move. I just don't understand the frenzy about Mr. Franzen. I also tried reading THE CORRECTIONS; it has the same kind of boring, weak, mean characters as in FREEDOM although maybe a little worse. I think Mr. Franzen doesn't like people.
B000654YRY|3.0|I would really like to give an honest review of this DVD; but, I can't because even though it has been a month since I ordered it, it has not shown up yet.  Pretty hard to review something that never arrived!  Probably an excellent DVD (I love Dire Straits), but lousy service!

0143118420|4.0|According to the reviews on this site, people seem to love or hate Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat Pray Love. The story follows the author's quest to put herself back together again after an early mid-life crisis, a quest that takes her to Italy in search of pleasure (the culinary type, not the romance novel type), to India in search of spirituality, and to Bali in search of a way to balance the two. As many reviews complain, Gilbert is no hero - she can be seflish and whiny. But I don't think that stops the book from being a joy to read. Gilbert's writing is laugh out loud witty, and her adventures (after the drama of her divorce) make for a light, entertaining beach read. I say accept this book for what it is (not a travel guide, nor a spiritual guide), and you will probably be pleased.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This is my first time buying a ps3 headset so i have nothing to compare it to, but i will say this. The controls make for a user friendly product. Sound and Chat quality are excellent. I have notice that during online gameplay other players have problems with their bluetooth and wireless headsets like low battery life and low chat quality as a result but not me. I count on my headsets to fully work everytime i boot up my ps3 and they do not disappoint. Worth every penny.......
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Outstanding compact, easy to use tool for beginners as well as for daily knife users. Quickly puts a good working edge on mid-range knives for daily use. My trusty Gerber LST has never been happier. Also gets the hardest steels and titanium blades about 90% of the way there, and even quickly puts a decent edge on $3 import knives (which will need to repeated too often on el-cheapo stainless knives) just be gentle.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|If you're building a rig, don't skimp on the paste. Stock paste is like stock tires, they work OK, but there is a better option. I used this stuff on my i7 rig I built last year and have no regrets spending the dollars for basically a pea-sized drop you'll use once.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B002ZG993Q|3.0|\\"The American\\" makes \\"Schindler's List\\" look like a happy, uplifting film. Seriously. George Clooney plays Jack, an American hit man who relocates from Sweden to Italy after an attempt is made on his life. Jack decides to take on one last assignment before retiring. While in Italy, he falls for Clara (Violante Placido), a local prostitute he's been keeping company with. Eventually Jack figures out that he's still a target, and his miserable existence comes to a predictable end.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie. Clooney is fantastic, as always, and the film features beautiful (and sometimes creepy) scenes from the Italian countryside. Although the audience sympathizes with Jack, we really don't know anything about his past: what led him to this career, what he's been through, etc. Some additional personal information on the character would have been interesting. However, every single part about Jack's life and this movie as a whole is 100%, god-awful depressing. It's hard to like a movie that is just such a downer. Also, the whole Jack/Clara relationship wasn't very believable to me (and I am not just saying that because I am super jealous of Placido for being able to act out those steamy love scenes with Gorgeous George).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good and interesting film, but it's not among my picks for the ultimate George Clooney DVD boxed set, if you know what I mean. (On a positive note, \\"The American\\" does include a Clooney semi-naked butt shot, so it's worth checking out at least for that.)
B003JSSPSY|1.0|I was so excited when this series came out.  I was finally going to get a visual look into the books that are at the top of my favorites list.    The first episode wasn't too bad although some things were changed.  I was willing to accept that they needed to make small changes for TV.  However, once the show got going they changed the story line so much it was rediculous. They added in things that were never in the books and things that directly contradicted the books.    Why do people do that.  There are 10 plus books in this series with more than enough material to make one hell of a series.    I would never recommend this series to anyone and anyone who has read the books should stay away from it.   If you haven't read the books pick them up and read them.  You won't be able to put them down and you will definately not waste your money on this terrible representation of the series.
0618918248|5.0|I'll keep this review short and sweet.    This book is a life changer. Having been raised religious and taught specifically never to question it, as well as respect the religions of others, I got a lot from this book.     Dawkins' points are solid and well supported with research and evidence. He brings to light concepts I would have never thought of.    I am proud to be a real atheist now; this book changed my thoughts from skeptical agnostic.     Highly recommended for all readers, especially those questioning the world's massive religious cults.     I just wish I had the ability to give this book to my religious parents.
B00005MM01|4.0|I'm so glad to see that this wonderful album is back in print.  I always felt that,  after passing through his Dylan folkie phase and his psychedelic hippie phase, where he was composing within existing styles, if you will, Donovan found his true voice on this record, unique and completely different from what had gone before. \\"Starfish-on-the-Toast\\" has always been one of my very favorite songs and it's great to be able to hear it again.
0399156577|5.0|I read this on my Kindle, and it was the first Nora Roberts book I've experienced. I enjoyed it very much! What drew me to the story was the fact that it was a modern romance and that the story included dogs. I am an animal lover, what can I say? It took a little bit for the story to develop, but once it unfolded I had a hard time putting it down. Taking place in the San Juan Islands of Washington state, Fiona is haunted by the memory of a killer that nearly took her life, eight years prior. The serial killer did kill her fiance as punishment for escaping him. She immerses herself in her work with dog training and Search & Rescue. Now, eight years have passed and a copy cat killer is again stalking and killing young co-eds, with the exact same pattern. Meanwhile, a new guy in town with an overly rambunctious puppy is needing her help to get control of the bundle of energy. What ensues is the growing attraction between opposite personality types, and the replacement killer coming to make sure the \\"one that got away\\" won't get away again. I would love to see more stories about the lives of Fiona's friends, on Orcas Island.
B002ZG97RY|1.0|The 2nd hand Green Zone BD I got had a broken case, email seller for replacement but seller was very slow in response, took more almost 2 weeks to get a replacement.  Then after reviewing details of my purchase, I realized that it wasn't what I ordered - I ordered the 2 disc limited edition with digital copy, but received only the single disc version without digital copy.  So I contact seller again, and he said mail it back for a refund .... so here I returned it again, only it is more then 2 weeks after he received my returned BD but I am still waiting for the refund. Will definitely not buy from this seller again, and not recommend other customer to purchase from this seller!
B000MZHW40|5.0|I can see there are over three hundred reviews for this movie.<br />What can I add to the discussion?<br />Probably not much lol.<br />I'll make it short.<br />The good.<br />Everything.<br />Excellent story, excellent acting, perfect direction, pacing, score, you name it, it was done well.<br /><br />The bad?<br />Some people have said this movie is a tad preachy and yeah, it is but it wasn't enough to make me deduct any stars.<br /><br />After seeing Leo in Shutter Island I finally decided to revisit his older work and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />An excellent film and a must see.<br />Highly recommended.
1401224253|5.0|Red Son is an amazingly twisted and introspective look at just how different the Superman story could have been if his capsule had hit Earth even an hour off.   Even people who aren't Superman fans need to give this a read, it's is so much better than anything else I own. The twist at the end is pretty wild too.
B0012GMVG2|5.0|By 1982 Toto needed a hit.  after two critically lackluster albums Toto was close to losing their label.  Toto delivered....big time.        Toto IV Is a perfect pop/rock album that hits all the right spots.  They'd been on a formula.....by this album the formula's perfected  The album opens with Rosanna.  A mega-hit for the group.  The perfect melding of instruments and voice.  All anchored by Jeff Porcaro's superb groove.  Add in a horn section and you've got pop heaven.  The Song has a natural build that is just spot on, With verses traded between Steve Lukather and Bobby Kimball.  Make Believe is A Paich Penned salute to motown.  Just a wonderful tune that'll have you singing in no time.         Next comes my favorite cut.  I Won't Hold you Back is the beginning of a string of beautiful Steve Lukather ballads.  This ballad is just great.  The harmonies in this song reminded me of the Eagles, and surprise.....Eagles bassist Timothy B Schimdt sings on the chorus.  Great tune.         Other highlights include Good For you....Another fun upbeat motown'ish sing along tune.  The smooth R n B of Waiting for your Love.  The other big hit of course Africa.  A great closer with a great laid back verse sung by David Paich.   Then...BOOM monster chorus from Kimball.  Also the finest bass work from David Hungate, and keys from Steve Porcaro.  Well crafted boys.        This album hauled in a ton of Grammys.  Including Best Album.  Unfortunately   This would be the end of the line for Bobby Kimball and David Hungate.  Kimball being fired and Hungate quitting.  On the next album it would show with horrible results.  This is Toto IV A masterwork of a pop/rock album.  Not a note out of place.  Get it now.    Mick

0765326353|5.0|From the unusually intricate artwork on the inside covers, to the sketches and maps heading each chapter, and obviously to the intricate story itself, this is what epic fantasy is all about.  Fans of Sanderson's writing will not be disappointed, and will again be anxiously awaiting the follow-up, as I will be.
0399156577|2.0|I found it really telling that it took me so long to finish this book.  With a really engrossing book (action, characters, descriptions, research, etc) I can't put it down, and if I have to, I run back to it when I have a free moment.  Not so with this book...it took me weeks to finish because it just didn't hold my attention.     Other reviewers found the dog sections overdone.  I actually enjoyed that, but I am a dog person.  I didn't like Simon and found it hard to believe Fiona would, being the woman she is.  He's bossy and irritating, and spends the book telling her he didn't want to fall in love with her.  Okay, then, well DON'T! is what I'd say.  I actually liked her, Syl, the vet, and the search team descriptions, but their romance just didn't ring true.      There's this big buildup to the ending, and instead of an explosive ending with this killer, all we got was a weak firecracker going off.  Serious letdown.    I've been reading Nora for years, and hands down have always loved her stories.  This one felt phoned in, and I'm very disappointed.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|So I purchased this product even though I purchased the 5 seasons previously because I wanted to have the collection goodies that this product has. It would've been a lot nicer if I didn't have the previous seasons. I loved the show, so I'm not gonna comment on the story of Lost.  About the contents: The letter was a cool thing to read. The ankh couldn't been molded better, its an imperfect cross, but oh well. Jacob's message was a bunch a symbols (they say its a message to help you find the hidden disc) .  Black light was a cool thing to have. Use it on the map and on a black cardboard paper under the seasons box. It has alot of hidden messages too which are revealed with black light. It shows the diagram shown in Season 2 when Locke's is trapped on the security door and they fail to push the button and the lights go out revealing diagram and other messages. The map doesn't have the locations written, and it was confusing not to see 2 islands. The Exclusive episode guide has a small description for every episode and pictures of importance scenes of the series. The Senet game is also nice, its a thick cardboard with the symbols not like the series where it was a wooden box. (I didn't expect them to make an exact replica of the game in the series). The next day of me receiving the collection, I saw on a site that there is a hidden bluray disc, I couldn't believe it but then again, I didn't read carefully that it wasn't 35 discs, its 36. That disc had the smoke monster effects on the main menu and sub menus which was cool. I don't wanna be the guy who spoiled the whereabouts of the hidden disk so if you cant find it, google it. Opening this box is like opening a treasure chest, if your into Lost and collectibles, your gonna love this.
B00008HE46|5.0|Julie Alston    REL-110-FON01    Kimberly Maddox    September 5, 2010    Review of the Rabbit Proof Fence    This film takes place in Western Australia in the 1930's.  It was during this time that Aboriginal children were being ripped from their families as well as their culture and traditions.  Many were living on \\"government-owned stations\\".  This was land overseen by the government, but also served as a means of containing these indigenous people.  The Aborigines were indigenous or native to Australia and lived off of the earth.  They were very spiritually connected to their environment and their heritage.  Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were three young girls, or \\"half-castes\\".  Half-caste is a term, considered racially inflammatory that refers to the mixture of races between Aborigines and Europeans.  The half-castes were viewed as inferior and the government made it their mission to try to integrate these people into society.  Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were forcibly taken from their mother's one day when they went into \\"town\\" to get their rations.     Disregarding their mothers' desperate cries and attempts to prevent the girls from being separated from them, the constable showed no mercy and threw each girl into the back of his car and sped away.  The girls traveled for many miles until they reached their final destination which was an \\"internment camp\\".  Here the girls would be trained to become domestic workers and integrated into white society.  Molly was determined that she and Daisy and Gracie would not stay at the camp.  Molly waited until the time was right, when everyone else was attending church, and they made a run for it.  The girls had a head start by the time the camp officials realized they were gone.  The camp sent their \\"tracker\\" which also happened to be an Aboriginal man to follow the girls and bring them back.     After several days, Gracie was tricked into believing her mother was in a nearby town and decided not to continue with Molly and Daisy.She was eventually apprehended and returned to camp.  After months of walking the continent of Australia, the dangerous and arduous journey of these girls came to an end.  They finally were reunited with their mother and their native land.       This movie was excellent and was a perfect example of indigenous culture and society that we have been reading about in our text book.  It actually made you realize how important the culture and tradition of indigenous peoples are to them.  It is what defines them and it is who they are.  They are the spirit of their land and the spirit of their land lives within them.  No one has the right to impose their beliefs on anyone else or strip them of their heritage to try to make them fit into their idea of what is right.
1416589473|5.0|I picked this up on a whim after viewing the website for the game. What I really liked about this book was it was almost a character study and not the usual fantasy fodder you find in every book store these days. The heroes were not divinely selected heirs to some kingdom or had some hidden power that they just had to believe in themselves to use....they were simple everyday men and women who are doing what they have to do.<br />I highly recommend this book if you like fantasy but have a hard time struggling through the usual fantasy fare....

031237674X|4.0|To someone who has never had any interest or knowledge about reincarnation, this book is a real eye-opener. If even one of the stories could be proven to be real, the cat would be out of the bag. We would all know for sure that SOMETHING happens to us when we die. And some of the evidence Dr Tucker presents is seriously compelling. The book has to be read for this to be understood.<br />And what makes it even more compelling for me, is that the author never concludes that the evidence proves reincarnation. He keeps his personal opinion away, and allows the reader to make his own conclusions. This is much better than a religious book which rams everything down your throat with a forthright \\"I must be right\\" opinion.<br />Topics regarding reincarnation must remain open to all of us as they simply cannot be proved or disproved. This book is a classic on showing you what's going on out there.
0525421580|5.0|John Green and David Levithan are basically literary YA gods as it is, but when you put them together, you get something that is essentially perfection.<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson is easily my feel-good book of the year. It's witty, hilarious, comically outlandish, yet tender, charming, and full of heart. The two Will Grayson's are so different from one another and have such distinctive voices that I found myself tearing through the pages to see just what was happening with each of them.<br /><br />Will Grayson #1, the Will who has a not so tiny best friend named Tiny, comes off as that always in the background kind of guy. He tries to stick to everyone's periphery, but has a hard time doing that with such a huge and flamboyant best friend. His girl issues, friend issues, and fake ID issues are told in such a matter of fact way that I couldn't help but feel for him, but laugh at the same time. Out of the two Wills, this one is my favorite.<br /><br />Will Grayson #2, the Will with no real friends and a gay secret, comes off as just depressed and almost pitiful. I couldn't help but feel bad for him, but this Will does not take pity. His anger and self-hatred comes off so raw that it's impossible to not feel something for him.<br /><br />As the story progresses, the pent up emotions that both Will's harbor begin to boil to the surface and explode with the opening of Tiny's biggest gay musical in history. As far as characters go, this book has them in droves. Will Grayson and Will Grayson and interesting and unique, but the supporting characters are all very strong and well-fleshed out as well. Tiny, the gay football player, Jane, the pretentiously cute girl, Isaac, the online gay buddy, and even depressing, `I want to be more than just friends' Maura, all have something that makes them stick out. Their personalities are as large as Tiny and they refuse to go unnoticed.<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson is an incredibly well-written gem that sticks out in the mountain of YA books out today. This more than lives up to the hype with zingers on every single page and characters that I'm not likely to ever forget. I had a goofy grin plastered on my face nearly the entire time I was reading this and that's doesn't happen too often.<br /><br />Opening line: When I was little, my dad used to tell me, \\"Will, you can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.\\" ~ pg. 3<br /><br />Favorite line(s): this is why we call people exes, i guess - because the paths that cross in the middle end up separating at the end. it's too easy to see an X as a cross-out. it's not, because there's no way to cross out something like that. the X is a diagram of two paths. ~ pg. 277is more than lives up to the hype with zingers on every single page and characters that I'm not likely to ever forget.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|my wife and i were never trekkies, but we grew up watching shatner, and the old star trek and liked it, never really got into the spinoffs even though i liked the next generation movies, wife didn't, we both just finished watching the new star trek movie, and very glad i bought it, we liked the characters, the humor, storyline, the action, special effects were outstanding, don't understand some of these reviews and what they want in a movie, they nailed most of the characters, the movie without spoiling anything was a little fast put together as the crew were put in their places a little earlier then was believable, but we loved the movie and can't wait for the next one, without spoiling anything the romantic interlude was very unexpected, the plot great, characters likeable, this movie had the humor the next generation and other star treks lacked which i think is why my wife loved it so much, james kirk was a little bit wacky, spock's voice was a little high pitched, was it a perfect movie, such thing is not possible, but a great movie we both think it was, simon pegg could have been brought in a little sooner also, if you are a fan of any star trek or star wars, it hard to believe you would not like or love this movie, good luck and take care...............
B002ZG993Q|1.0|After Solaris I promised myself I'd never pay to see another Clooney movie and I wish I'd kept that promise. The opening scene was promising then Clooney showed up to drive his car for 10 excruciating long minutes before getting out and looking around at three strangers, climbing back in his car and driving again. The WHOLE movie was like watching your dishwasher go through it's cycles, but even that would be more interesting.  Clooney looks 60ish and he must've done this movie to be able to have sex with a young woman. DVD Cover shows him running. LOL. Never (except at the very end). Never did the movie explain WHY his boss wanted to kill him. Never did it explain why the girl his boss hired to Clooney killed her. Don't waste your money even when it comes out on PPV or DVD.
0142403873|3.0|I bought this to replace our current tattered read-so-much version and the copy I received has been altered from the original text! I have no idea why except that some 'clever fellow' decided that Americans wouldn't recognize some of the layout of the language, because the original version has British wording. Ridiculous! The part that says &#34;oh my&#34; fox said should read &#34;I'm off!&#34; Fox said .. this has totally changing the rhyme in some places. Not the book we've grown to love.. sending it back for the same the hard cover one I currently have and hopefully it will not be with the altered text! P.S. The one I owned was purchased in Canada, where they use British English. I also ordered for a friend from Amazon.co.uk delivered to US.

1423113381|4.0|Rick Riordan once again delivers with an all new, exciting adventure that explores the Egyptian gods and two children who are someone meant to save the world. The Kane Chronicles will inevitably be compared to the Percy Jackson series and I'm happy to say that it really lives up to it.<br /><br />Carter and Sadie Kane are intelligent kids with a whole lot of courage and even more willpower. At just 14 and 12 years of age, respectively, the brother sister duo bring some great humor with their bickering and sibling rivalry. The instant character connection is something that Riordan is so good at. It's impossible not to like Sadie and Carter. Their distinct, and quite amusing, voices are so lively and fun. Having grown up separately, their bickering is, at times, a bit more deep than your average brother/sister fighting, but that strengthens their bond.<br /><br />The Egyptian gods, the royal bloodlines, the artifacts and historical figures are all wonderful. I have no idea how Riordan is able to do all this research and then somehow spin it into a magical tale, but I hope he never stops doing so. Egyptian history/mythology always interested me more than Greek mythology, so I was completely enthralled with The Red Pyramid. The gods were interesting, the fighting was exciting, and the twists and turns were phenomenal. As a fan of Riordan in general, I adored this book; and as a fan of the PJO series, I loved the implied connection to that world within this one. I look forward to the continuation of a sure-to-be brilliant series.<br /><br />Opening line: We only have a few hours, so listen carefully. ~ pg. 1<br /><br />Favorite line: You see gods have great power, but only humans have creativity, the power to change history rather than simply repeat it. ~ pg. 179
B000UG4LYU|4.0|Buddha Of Suburbia is an album even some hardcore David Bowie fans don't know about. This was done for a TV mini-series of the same name in 1993.<br /><br />And is among Bowie's best: this has the gloss of his early 1990s work like [[ASIN:B00000E7Q6 Black Tie White Noise]]. Diverse as that album is, Buddha Of Suburbia may be even more so.  The score is a mix of dance music, some [[ASIN:B00001OH7X Lodger]]-like pop, ambient, and even free jazz. But the smooth sound makes the album completely cohesive.<br /><br />It is simple but true: David Bowie is a master musician that can make any music he sets mind to. This is pooff.
0451228375|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" but this comes nowhere near the earlier work.  It is monotonous and predictable.  The characters are one-sided to the point of stereotype. Their foibles and flaws, virtues and talents, problems and predicaments are often repetitious. Some of the many sexual scenes seem gratuitous fillers and impede the flow of the narrative.    A lengthy, boring work, it reads as if the author was paid by the word.

0439023513|5.0|After finishing Mockingjay, I felt completely drained. Both mentally and emotionally. The closing book in the trilogy is a whirlwind of everything that made the previous two books brilliant, but this one holds a much more terrifying and foreboding tone.<br /><br />Every twist, every surprise will tear you apart in some way. It's really difficult for me to describe it if you haven't read the book, but the characters go through hell and back here.<br /><br />Where The Hunger Games introduced us to this world where children were forced to fight to the death and Catching Fire lit the spark of a rebellion, Mockingjay becomes a war zone. Happy endings are hard to come by and there is a massacre around every corner, making this book so much darker than the last two.<br /><br />Instead of going into the war zone of an arena, we are catapulted into a real war zone with bombs, gunfire, and death. The politics of it all leaves us unable to trust anything we learn. Everyone has motives for doing what they are doing, but it's a matter of figuring just what is right that is the most difficult part. All this leads to so much inner turmoil for Katniss and a box of Kleenex may be needed to make it to the end. I know I was tearing up every few chapters.<br /><br />Many characters face obstacles that we could never imagine and minor characters take on roles we could only have hoped for. The lies, deceit, hatred, anguish, despair, heartache, joy, and even hope take their toll. There were a few times when I just had to take a break and pull myself together because the book was just wiping me out. The death, the carnage, and the emotional upheaval are a lot to take. Collins never lets us forget that we are in a war zone with Katniss and in war, there are no winners. Fighting a war is not easy and there will be casualties and consequences, lives lost and lives destroyed.<br /><br />The war zone mentality detracts from the Team Peeta/Team Gale atmosphere that lingered in the last two books, but the relationship between Peeta/Katniss/Gale is still explored with insurmountable care and delicacy. With all that has happened, one can only hope that all of them can find some sort of peace.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins did something special with this series. Not only is the world of THG absolutely captivating, it is thought-provoking and emotional. Mockingjay is a heart-wrenching finale that will leave readers thinking about it long after turning that final page. The rollercoaster ride of emotions left me drained from the intensity of a world where a girl lit the spark that ignited a nation.<br /><br />Opening line: I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather. ~ pg. 3<br /><br />Favorite line: Closing my eyes doesn't help. Fire burns brighter in the darkness. ~ pg. 352niss/Gale is still explored with insurmountable care and delicacy.

0307408833|1.0|I've been to the Babycakes store at least 20 times since they opened on the lower east side of Manhattan (very much out of my way) and decided to buy their cookbook and splurge on all the pricey ingredients and make some of them myself. I am a concise and meticulous cook and followed the recipes perfectly. The cupcakes taste nothing like the ones in their store, they are harder and drier and the frosting never reaches the proper thickness or consistency, even after refrigerating it overnight. The frosting tastes nothing like the one they use at the store. My guests who tried the \\"treats\\" all made polite faces, the same ones that previously loved the store bought Babycakes cupcakes. I spent a lot of money on these ingredients and a lot of time preparing and expected at least a reasonable facsimile to the ones at the store. A major disappointment to say the least.
0060527986|5.0|This collection of short passages serves as a foundation and inspiration for those willing to follow the Path, fight the Good Fight and become and live as a Warrior of the Light.  Coelho reminds us over and over again - whether through the books, the short passages or his collections such as this one that we fight the Good Fight for perfection and to improve ourselves and those around us - but that we are imperfect, will sometimes be defeated, and only the warrior who learns from their defeats and continues to fight follows the Path of Light<br /><br />The Manual is perhaps used as a daily devotional or meditative tool. Pick a page, read it, contemplate the meaning.  Chew on the morsel that Coelho has cooked up for you.  In so doing, you can grow as a warrior and follow the path of light as well.
0439023513|5.0|This was a brilliant finale. But be warned it's very sad at times and Suzanne Collins doesn't have a problem killing anyone apparently. But I'm happy with how it ended. The only negative I have for it is that sometimes it drags on longer than it should in places.
0870703781|5.0|At first blush Egglestons's photographs seem mundane, which to my mind is much the point.  This is also the work that launched the medium of color photography into the art world.  No amount of words can really say why these photographs are so successful at lodging themselves under your skin.  Yes, they evoke time and place in a way that can cut to the bone, but there is more to it than that.  Spend some time with this book, look at these images, that is the only way to really understand what this work is all about.
0765326353|5.0|I don't have the words to properly describe Sanderson's Way of Kings, so I'll just say this:  I feel lucky to be alive in a time when stories of this caliber are being told.  Sanderson grasps the battle between emotion and logic like no other author.  He builds a riveting plot around the idea and sets it in a fascinating world with characters that you instantly love.    Although this is the first novel in a 10-book series, it has an extremely satisfying conclusion.  Sanderson lays out the pieces for a much larger puzzle, and you're left with the feeling that he's given you almost everything you need to solve it.  But you can't.  It's infuriatingly clever, as always, and it makes me giddy with anticipation for the second book.
B00371QQ34|4.0|This is a no-nonsense Blu release that has the DVD version on the opposite side - I can't say that I appreciate the arrangement but that's the way it is so we'll have to live with it.<br /><br />The Blu side lacks extras but the movie's Blu transfer is nothing short of spectacular both for picture and sound, considering this Jackal's age. There is a 'The Making of the Jackal' featurette on the DVD side but that's the side that gets lots of fingerprints and I didn't play it yet. I truly enjoyed watching this Blu release and this is all that matters, after all.<br /><br />The picture format is 2.35:1, 1080p, of course, with the default sound as DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. A French sound track is available on the DVD side only.<br /><br />There are 2 Blu-ray specific features:<br /><br />- My Scenes (can be useful) - allows you to mark clips while watching for later viewing.<br />- Universal Tickler (very annoying) - downloads 'updates' while your player is booting up with the movie and then plays unwanted commercials until you hit the 'Menu' key and escape out of it.<br /><br />To conclude, I loved watching The Jackal in HD but I will take away one star for the minor annoyances that I've mentioned already. If I were a Jackal/Bruce Willis fan and had a Blu player I'd buy it even if I had the DVD already. I know that I did.
0439023513|1.0|I think the author should do a \\"do over\\" and give loyal fans of her first two books the final book in the trilogy we've been waiting for.  It's like she was rushing through, just trying to get something written and totally forgot how to write and develop the story.  She turned the lead characters into a bunch of unlikeable victims rather than unforgettable heroes.  Totally unsatisfying ending, VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I will hesitate to recommend any of the books due to the way it ends.  Not just the actual ending, but the entire third book which was a complete waste of time and money.  I would give it zero stars if I could.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|What, Kajol and Shah Rukh together again on cinema after nearly ten years? And Karan Johar again directing them? O happy day. Okay, I did fleetingly think - when I first eyeballed the movie's title - that, oboy, Shah Rukh Khan had finally let his ego get to him. But, it turns out, this title MY NAME IS KHAN is quite relevant to the story. I think that Shah Rukh is a hell of an actor, except he'd always been hampered (and pigeonholed) with those showy romantic lead roles. So it's real nice that, in the past few years, as he's gotten older, he's begun to stretch himself (SWADES, CHAK DE INDIA!, RAB NE BANA DI JODI). And Kajol is Kajol. Whereas Shah Rukh's instincts lean toward flashiness and the expansive gesture, Kajol gets a lot of stuff done with her more minimal, more unaffected performance. Of course, you get drawn to that irresistible spirit of hers, and those stormy eyes.<br /><br />Shah Rukh plays Rizvan Khan, a Muslim Indian with a knack for fixing broken objects. Rizvan is afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome, thus rendering him a highly functional autistic. He's easily discomfited by sharp sounds and by the color yellow, and forget about eye contact. Sponsored by his brother, Rizvan makes a new life in San Francisco and begins working for his brother's company, selling his Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products (the pamphlet boasts that women using these products will \\"shine like a newly wedded bride\\"). Given his condition, Rizvan is often frightened, and peace of mind doesn't truly arrive until he meets Mandira (Kajol), a lovely, effervescent single mother. He hawks his wares to her; they become friends. It's a start.<br /><br />It should be noted that Kajol has never required Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products to glow like a newly wedded bride.<br /><br />That legendary spark between them is still there, still effortless and considerable. Whenever it's just Shah Rukh and Kajol interacting, the movie is really good. Both actors are marvelous in constructing their slow burn relationship, and it's key that you buy into their romance, especially in Rizvan's affection for Mandira. It's his love for her, after all, which drives the plot and which continually urges him on in his monumental journey. I don't know how true to life SRK's performance is of someone with Asperger's Syndrome, but you instantly sympathize with Rizvan even as you acclimate to his quirky, jarring mannerisms.<br /><br />Where the film falters at times is when it tries to get on message. No rhapsodic singing and dancing in this one. Director Karan Johar is trying for something else here. In its production values and technical execution, MY NAME IS KHAN is very polished. And yet it can't quite get away from all the Bollywood tropes. The story has things to impart concerning religious differences and racial intolerance (and profiling) in a post-9/11 climate. Except that sometimes, as scenes play out, the message is delivered in a heavyhanded or overwrought fashion. Note the really cringe-worthy sequence in Georgia when Rizvan first meets \\"Mama Jenny\\" and \\"Funny Hair Joel.\\" The film also suggests that there are only two kinds of people: good people and bad people. That is a hell of an oversimplification. Life inhabits plenty of gray areas. Another thing that bugged me is would Rizvan's brother really have deployed his autistic brother out in the streets by himself to sell products? That is a seriously callous move.<br /><br />Rizvan wins Mandira, but then loses her. To win her back, he embarks on a cross-country odyssey which gains prominence in the film's second half. Rizvan's journey is fraught with effective sequences but also with moments that oversell themselves. I love that SRK and Kajol have reunited, and I'm happy that that magical rapport is still present (and it must suck to be Ajay Devgan whenever his wife Kajol and SRK have a movie out). Only, a bit more restraint on the director's part would have done wonders. Still, flaws and all, I recommend this film. It's got a good heart and is worth at least 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The DVD extras: \\"Changing the Face of Bollywood\\" has director Karan Johar and SRK reflecting on the globalization of Indian cinema (00:04:47 minutes long); \\"Working Together\\" explores that heady chemistry between SRK and Kajol and how they are viewed as THE romantic film couple by Indian cinema-goers (00:04:38); \\"The Music Of MY NAME IS KHAN\\" - how the songs were carefully selected for soulfulness and spirituality - no flashy item numbers, please (00:02:48); \\"The Story of MY NAME IS KHAN\\" focuses on the film's story premise, that of one simple, innocent man changing the perceptions of those around him (00:06:03); the \\"Sajda\\" music promo (00:01:32) and the \\"Tee Naina\\" music promo (00:01:32).s got a good heart and is worth at least 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The DVD extras: \\"Changing the Face of Bollywood\\" has director Karan Johar and SRK reflecting on the globalization of Indian cinema (00:04:47 minutes long); \\"Working Together\\" explores that heady chemistry between SRK and Kajol and how they are viewed as THE romantic film couple by Indian cinema-goers (00:04:38); \\"The Music Of MY NAME IS KHAN\\" - how the songs were carefully selected for soulfulness and spirituality - no flashy item numbers, please (00:02:48); \\"The Story of MY NAME IS KHAN\\" focuses on the film's story premise, that of one simple, innocent man changing the perceptions of those around him (00:06:03); the \\"Sajda\\" music promo (00:01:32) and the \\"Tee Naina\\" music promo (00:01:32).
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought the iPAD for when we travel. It saves hauling my 17\\" laptop (not a MAC)around. All I needed was a way to upload my pictures so that I could post on the Internet while we traveled. This product met all my expectations.<br /><br />Pros:  Very easy to use. I attached the camera connector to my iPAD, inserted my camera card, and presto, the images appeared and were ready to import. The connectors appear to be well made. I expect nothing less from Apple.<br /><br />Cons: If anything, the price. I paid 40.00 with shipping included. However, I had to stretch to come up with a con. This is a good product and highly recommended.
B003L20ICE|4.0|\\"The Kids Are All Right\\" has humor, power, insight and helps to remind us what a family is really all about. It's also a cautionary tale: Passionate sex, by its self, does not automatically make for a good relationship. Strong feelings can overpower our better judgment. Being dishonest with those we love causes a lot of suffering, but it can be a forgivable offense. A long-term relationship is a big investment - emotionally, financially and spiritually and it should not be easily discarded when something substantial goes wrong. Same-sex couples can have the exact same problems opposite-sex couples do.<br /><br />One other lesson one can learn from this delightful film is that filmmakers can do a decent job when the central theme of a story is about a same-sex couple. \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" proves Hollywood can make a enjoyable film about gay, lesbian, bi-sexual or transgendered people without it having to be violent, depressing or insulting! I look forward to seeing more GLBT films like this in the future!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:0595005985 How to Win the Nobel Prize: The Ultimate Push for Unequivocal and Irrevocable Queer Rights and a Queer-Friendly World (Paradox and Human Learning Series)]] and [[ASIN:1593500459 Loving Ourselves: The Gay and Lesbian Guide to Self-Esteem]] and

In this book ,the six North Korean defectors portrayed ,act upon many emotional acts to survive and live, whether it is morally good or bad, and after which face emotional /personal consequences with fear ,guilt,loneliness,sadness, etc.To me, it is very comparative to people living religious cults, in which are emotionally hurt and guilty after learning the truths and facts[i.e. lies,deceit, etc.] on their former cult.    A must read !!
B000W74EQC|3.0|Film adaptations must strike a tricky balance between dual demands: fidelity to the source material and obligations of the new medium.  If you steer too far from the core ideas of the original story, then you betray those who loved the story long before it was green lit by a studio.  But if you chain your film to the source material, then the end product might end up being a rote matter of connecting plot points.  Sometimes those who love the original book or story tend to think that all a director needs to do is paste pages up on the big screen, but this ignores that different mediums, by necessity, must tell a story in different ways.  Long exposition might be effective in a novel, but ideally a film communicates more concisely through visuals.  In fact, one of my favorite adaptations, Blade Runner, not only departs wildly from the original book, but also seems to be arguing against it.        Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first film in a very long series of adaptations, never manages to strike an appropriate balance between the book and its new home in cinemas.  From the beginning it becomes clear that this film is not for the uninitiated.  It starts with several wizards arriving at an English suburb to drop off a young baby.  We don't know who these people are or why they need to drop off this youngster off at someone's front door.  The scene has a nice ambience to it and leaves enough questions to drive the film forward, but for someone who has not read the book, the question of the relationship between the baby in the basket and the family he is being left with becomes somewhat troubling.  There is a long tradition in books and films of random babies being dropped off at someone's door, so we cannot assume there is some relationship between the baby and those he is left with.  It turns out they are his aunt and his uncle, but we don't discover this until almost a half-hour into the film, shortly before Harry leaves for Hogwarts.  This is a minor problem but it is indicative of an inability for the film to break from the novels and establish itself as a piece of art that can stand on its own two feet.     We may not know who this family is, but it becomes clear early on that they are not the ideal family for an orphan.  They force Harry to live in a small closet under the stairs, and they clearly favor their biological son over the one left on their doorstep.  Not only is Harry's cousin spoiled beyond what is appropriate for a young child, but he also appears to be well on his way to contracting type-2 diabetes.  Luckily, when Harry reaches an appropriate age, he is recruited into Hogwarts, a school for young wizards.  This is something his aunt and uncle apparently dread, going so far as to move to the middle of nowhere to avoid the onslaught of acceptance letters from Hogwart's.  But this is to no avail, and Harry is recruited by Hagrid, a friendly, if slightly bumbling wizard, who has a difficult time keeping secrets when the plot requires a little more information in order to move forward.  Soon Harry learns that both his parents were wizards, but that they were murdered when he was very young, requiring the cadre of wizards from the beginning to deposit Harry at his aunt's and uncle's.     Anyone who has read Joseph Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces, or at least has seen Star Wars, can recognize the hero's journey in this setup.  The hero's journey is when a seemingly provincial protagonist is plucked from the mundane world in order to cross over into the world of magic and adventure.  Normally there is a guide who accompanies the hero as he traverses his way from the mundane to the magical.  In Star Wars this guide was Ben Kenobi, and here it's Hagrid.  The appeal of this setup is instantly recognizable.  Even if you were from the most well adjusted family, every child has felt persecuted by the seemingly arbitrary rules of adults.  And who hasn't felt as a child that you weren't destined for somegrand adventure in your lifetime?     Along the way to Hogwarts, Harry encounters the sociable Ron and the slightly uptight A-student Hermione.  Upon arriving to Hogwarts, all three wind up in the Griffindor House, which means they will be competing against students from other houses for top prize at the end of the year.  Hogwarts certainly owes more than a little something to the British private school system, and I would imagine a similar system of competition could feasibly exist in the childhood of many British subjects.  Even the villainous student Draco, of the Slytherin House, has a haughty air of aristocracy straight out of George Orwell's memoir \\"Such, Such Were the Joys.\\"  (I'm giving little away when I tell you that Griffindor House wins the prize at the end of the year, but not before the headmaster, Dumbledor, lets Slytherin House think they have won.  This was a rather cruel move on Dumbledor's part and I half expected him to say \\"psych\\" before revealing that Griffindor won).     In addition to midterms, social cliques and getting to class on time, Harry and the gang must also worry about a mysterious object that is being housed within the deep recesses of Hogwarts.  They learn that this magical object has the ability to free the villainous Voldemort (much like Dickens, Rowling likes to twist names so her audience is absolutely certain who is good and who is bad).  The students are up against a teacher, Severus Snape, who they believe is planning on stealing the object in order to smuggle it to Voldemort.     There's much to enjoy about this first installment in the Harry Potter franchise, not the least of which is the filmmaker's intention of employing just about every great British actor imaginable (in addition to Robbie Coltrane and Hagrid, there's Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese and John Hurt).  While the child actors aren't always on the same level as their elders, within the spectrum of child acting from bad (Anakin fromPhantom Menace) to good (Elliot from E.T.) they're firmly within the middle.  Of the three main characters, however, it's Hermione who gets the most thankless role.  She's the student at the front of the class with her hand constantly in the air.  It's much easier to role your eyes at the A-student than to empathize.      But the real appeal of a film like this is being able to see the world of J.K. Rowling on film.  Since I've never read the book, I can only compare this fantasy world to others.  Rowling deftly cobbles together time honored fantasy creatures and concepts, but assembles them in such a way that they manage to be both familiar and new.  The film paints Hogwarts as an ancient castle, but imbues it with a sense of kinetic energy.  It is a place where ghosts roam the halls as leisurely as students, where paintings come to life and where staircases never stay in the same place twiece.  Hogwarts, like an M.C. Escher drawing, appears to contain more space within its confines than is physically possible.  Rowling has also created a fun, if slightly confusing, game called Quidditch, which is similar to rugby but on flying broomsticks.       Unfortunately, what really holds the film back is the direction.  At two and a half hours Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a lengthy film, which by itself isn't a problem.  I've seen enough David Lean films to enjoy immersing myself in a story.  And besides, part of the fun of a fantasy film is watching the filmmakers construct an entirely new world brick by brick.  The length wouldn't be a problem if the director was better skilled at creating atmosphere and urgency.  The director is Chris Columbus who showed promise in the 80s by directing films like Adventures in Babysitting and writing Goonies and Gremlins.  But since then he has become a third rate Spielberg with a higher tolerance for sentimentality.  Columbus draws his character with big bright crayons so no one can forget for one second who we are supposedto root against.  Harry's uncle is grossly obese, Draco's hair is slicked back like Gordon Geco from Wall Street, and even an opposing Quidditch player is given a mouthful of ungainly teeth.       It's Columbus's cumbersome direction, which stumbles from one scene in the book to another, that ultimately stifles the film.  Instead of bringing the underlining mystery to the forefront of the movie, we are left to sightsee in Rowlings world, which isn't an entirely unpleasant experience, throughout most of the movie.  This first installment in the Harry Potter series likely offers more for fans of the book to enjoy than for the uninitiated who wish for nothing more than a new fantasy classic.

0596805888|4.0|This book was designed for me.  I've never been comfortable in the kitchen and I haven't been a fan of cooking, as I just don't \\"get it\\" and always fear I might ruin other people's meals botching the cook job.  I've tried cookbooks, or getting recipes online, but just following directions rote is tedious and boring and I still feel like I might screw it up.      This book really goes into the how and why of Cooking.  I'm learning things like how temperatures and seasons can effect the quality, consistency, and nutrition of foods. It's like learning the legos of cooking, the building blocks, and the recipes are examples of the types of things you can make.  But once you understand the blocks, you start to see how you can re-assemble them in new, exciting ways, and its ok to experiment.      There are also great inteviews with cooks and twitter/internet celebrities. The latter is kind of an interesting choice; Some of them work, others don't, but it's like the author experimented with the traditional recipe for a book, so I still dig it.    My only real complaint is with the table of contents. I'm reading the ePub version in iBooks on an iPad.  I don't know if it's the publisher, the technology, or a combination of both, but the TOC links don't line up with the correct pages.  As I read, I have insights and/or get excited about a topic and want to jump to other sections of the book to see the recipes, but the links are quite a few pages off in some cases.  The book also tells me there are 929 pages, which I don't think is the case, but if true, I guess that makes it the cryptonomicon of cookbooks. So there is much page flipping, but all in all, a great, useful read!
B0000060NH|5.0|This album is a classic of its genre. the editorial reviewer nearly dustbins the album and says this record is \\"inessential\\". I say he is an idiot. Marvin Gaye laid it down and deviated from his Pop/R&B leanings, creating an LP that is stunning. i have never seen the film, but the soundtrack is emblazoned on my mind for all time creating its own visual landscape no \\"blaxploitation\\" director could ever conjure up. Also see Marvin Gaye Live to hear a lot of the tracks intertwined with other Gaye gems to dazzling effect.
B0000CABBW|4.0|The Whale Rider is a film that is about the Maori's cultures and traditions and about how the Maori people are trying to fit into the modern world that exists today. Pai is the young girl and she is faced with many challenges in this movie. She is a wonderful girl who has a great personality but she is hated by the males that surround her because there was an accident and her male twin died but she lived. According to culture the first born will become chief if he is male. Pai feels like she has let down her tribe because she survived the accident and because she is female. She believes that everyone would love her if she was male. Also that everyone wishes that she would have died instead of her male twin. Drama plagues the young girl when her grandpa is being very difficult when her twin brother dies and he treats the girl very harshly as if saying that he wished she would have passed away and her brother would had lived so that he could be chief and pass on the family name and make the grandpa and the whole other family proud by making things better for the life of the tribe's people. The Maori people believe that their ancestors have lived on the land that they now live on for over a thousand years. Pai is a girl who is filled with happiness and glows. Everyone around loves her for her upbeatness. Everyone except her grandfather who shows her no mind because he is too busy being depressed because Pai's twin who was a male and who was suppose to be the chief had died when he was born. The males around Pai have made her feel so bad because she lived and her male twin died. Overall this is a great movie for people of all ages. It encourages young females to never give up and to always chase their dreams.   This movie relates to world religions because this tribe in the movie relates to indigenous people and the native people. They are a tribe that inhabits the very same land that they believe their ancestors once lived on. Their culture and traditions were passedon from their ancestors and they still live this way of life even though they are faced with the common issues that modern day society throws at them.

B003M8NG94|2.0|It's old hat that Warner weren't keen on Mars Attacks! however I had hoped a change within the company would have resulted in a darn site more respect being bestowed upon its blu ray release. None of the extras from the dvd are carried over, and the transfer is another of Warner's (hello Eraser!) dull, noise/grain reduced and thus lacking that HD quality pop releases. Fine detail is seriously lacking, so much so, there's nowhere near the step up from sd-dvd it should have been.    Save your hard earned, it's not worth buying.    Warner please get your finger out and rerelease this as a special edition with a restored transfer.

1400052173|5.0|Despite my years of studying and teaching math and science, I am always caught off guard when I discover I missed an important story.  Granted, my expertise is in physics and math.  Still, after reading about Henrietta Lacks, I am surprised at how such a discovery could have eluded my attention for so long.  Fortunately, Rebecca Skloot's book has rectified that omission.<br /><br />How many advances in medicine over the course of the last half century have depended upon the use of cultured cells?  Their use in drug trials, radiation tests, fundamental cell research (like the discoveries of chromosomes and DNA), and more, is crucial to the advancement of our understanding.  Yet it was not that long ago that many scientists despaired of ever finding human cells that would survive being cultured.  That all changed in 1951 when a tissue sample was taken from a tumor on the cervix of Henrietta Lacks, and the HeLa cell line was born.<br /><br />It seems like a story that wouldn't necessarily take an entire book to tell; however, Ms. Lacks story is one of murky medical ethics with which we still struggle.  Ill during a time when medical experimentation was often done on people without their understanding or consent, this problem was particularly bad in the African-American community--think of the Tuskegee syphilis study.  And though there seems to be no evidence that the doctors at Johns Hopkins didn't do everything possible at the time to save Ms. Lacks from her particularly virulent cancer (a quality that made those cells able to survive in culture), it is also true that the sample was taken without informed consent and many millions of dollars have been made selling her cells while her descendents have never seen a dime and struggle in poverty.  It begs the question that we still haven't sufficiently answered: who has the rights over your body tissues once they leave your body?<br /><br />But do not be fooled: this is not a book of dry history and medical ethics.  It is a dynamic story of people and science.  We learn about Ms. Lacks and her descendents; in particular, her daughter, Deborah, who wants so much to know the mother she lost and see her mother recognized for what she contributed to science.  We meet the scientists who worked so hard to come up with cultured cells in the first half of the 20th century.  And we get to know the author, Ms. Skloot, who herself becomes a part of the story she is telling.<br /><br />What we end up with is a very readable account that puts a face on the scientific shorthand.  HeLa is Henrietta Lacks.  Overwhelmed by the magnitude of scientific advance these days, it is easy to forget the ethical murkiness that brought about many of these triumphs and the people who were crucial to that success, test subjects and patients put aside and forgotten.  Ms. Skloot has done us a great service in her long pursuit of this story.le and science.

0439023491|4.0|These days I tend to wait for the entire series of books to come out before I keep reading.  So, after reading and enjoying The Hunger Games, I read this second book in the series once the third and final one, Mockingjay, came out last week.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first part of the novel.  Seeing Katniss back in District 12 as victor, trying to piece together her life, is fascinating.  I was intrigued by the victory tour, the glimpse of the various other districts, and the rumbles of discontent in the various districts.  The tension-building in the renewal of harsh Peacekeepers in District 12 is excellent.  The encounter with President Snow in her house remains eerie, long after reading it.<br /><br />The return of the Hunger Games in the second half, however, has the feel of retreading old ground.  Granted, it's different this time around and it's interesting seeing the new challenges of the arena.  I also liked learning some more of the history of the games (like Haymitch's experiences in the arena).  Still, I couldn't shake that \\"been there, done that\\" feeling and what seemed like the forced invention of Quarter Quell to take Collins where she wants to go.<br /><br />But in the end, we are left with a leaping off point into the final volume.  There are plenty of complications that are yet to be resolved.  I am very interested to see how everything plays out for Katniss, her friends and family.

0374158460|5.0|Jonathan Franzen seems to bring out extremes with his novels.  \\"The Corrections\\" was praised by the critics and far less praised here on amazon.com.  And as one can see,  \\"Freedom\\" has created the same kind of huge praise and the same kind of harsh criticism.  Many of the reviews say, in one manner or another, that the characters aren't likable.  I've never understood the desire for characters to be likable.  How about fascinating instead?  Read \\"Madame Bovary\\" and make notes about all the terrific, enjoyable  characters one can find.  Or \\"Moby Dick\\" Or \\"Rabbit Run\\" or three quarters of Phillip Roth's output.  (I could lengthen the list ad infinitum, but I hope the point is made).    I believe \\"Freedom\\" to be the work of a great writer.  He hit the ball out of the park with \\"The Corrections,\\" and he's hit it completely out of the park, over the parking lot, and  into the freeway that runs by.  It's not an easy read.  It requires some patience and some work, but it is hugely rewarding.  Whoever you are, if you're reading this review, I hope  you will take the plunge and buy this book.  They don't come much better than this, and you will remember this one.

0307271862|1.0|The Man From Beijing has an intricate, intriguing beginning. Mankell is a very talented writer who evocatively sets a very complicated, multi-generational international stage. But as it goes along it bogs down, increasing its scope and losing its edge.    Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say that the author introduces two completely new characters in the last 40 pages who play a huge role in the denouement. I feel like Mankell wrote himself, albeit intricately, into a corner, and in a desperate way to figure out an ending resorted to two out-of-left-field characters to wrap things up in a rather clumsy manner.    A major disappointment, especially after the stunning start.

B002A9OJ0Q|3.0|With Foot of the Mountain A-Ha have made a record which is pretty much what one would expect given that these guys are now aging former 80's stars on the verge of or in their 50s.    FOTM is a collection of slightly reflective-sounding slices of pleasantly melodic electronica... which is pretty much what A-Ha has always offered with few exceptions. There are no songs with the immediacy or charm of their debut Hunting High and Low album but there are some nice enough melodies here all the same. A-Ha have always had a rather nice way with melodies. The pace is a bit mid-tempo and can be a bit plodding and verging towards somnambulence (particularly on the narcolepsy-inducing Start the Simulator) over the course of the 10 songs which comprise this collection.    Former fans of A-Ha will doubtlessly like this record more than any of the uninitiated masses. This album is unlikely to gain new fans. The sound - pleasant though it is - is far from groundbreaking and there are countless demos out there by legions of home studio wizard keyboard enthusiasts that are at least as good as anything on this album.    A-Ha are a rather enigmatic proposition: Heralded as major pop star royalty in their hyper-nationalistic homeland of Norway where they regularly receive 5-star reviews, in truth A-Ha have rarely really rated a higher than mediocre 3/5 review (with few exceptions) from the international press corp at large.    If you are a fan of 80s music along the lines of OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark), Alphaville, the far superior Depeche Mode or Pet Shop Boys and haven't yet discovered A-Ha this album may appeal to you. I would personally recommend Hunting High and Low which remains one of their all-time bests.
0393068382|2.0|Much of the controversy about gender differences depends on a confusion about language.  If we ask the question \\"Can women do everything which men can?\\" the answer is of course yes.  Women can do philosophy, fight in wars and fly solo halfway around the world.  Even an Iranian women's team has climbed Mount Everest.<br /><br />But one could ask a different question, \\"Are the statistical distributions the same?\\"  They are not.  And note that many statistical distributions go against men.  Most (all?) of the people who have carried out various gun massacres are male.  Autism occurs far more often among men than among women.  But there is a loose association of Asperger's syndrome with mathematical ability and it should not be surprising that both occur far more often among men than among women.<br /><br />To do justice to such questions, one needs some understanding of probability and statistics and this book is singularly lacking in them.  What is even more surprising is that Fine is the daughter of a mathematician (he is more a philosopher than a mathematician but definitely the second as well).  Why has she not followed her father's footsteps and given us an erudite explanation of the statistical basis of difference?  And I am afraid she is herself demonstrating what I say.  She is forsaking mathematics, which is the language in which answers can be phrased, and resorting to polemics.<br /><br />If you look at her own two references in the book, neither of them is to a scientific article.  And this treatment extends to others as well. She criticizes Baron-Cohen, but all his articles she cites are from the popular media. Of the more than 250 scientific articles which Baron-Cohen has written, not a single one is cited.  Doreen Kimura comes in for a similar treatment.  The book has no tables and no mathematics.  When I looked for words like probability, statistics in the index, nothing turned up.<br /><br />So Fine is addressing a controversial topic with a lot of sarcasm and a lot of personal opinions,  but little of the hard scientific work which is needed to settle a thorny question.  She cites with approval (page 183) the girls (her term) who took part in the mathematical Olympiad.  But she herself seems to have little interest in mathematics, and she does not give you the figures which would allow you to compare the performance of boys and girls.  She tells you that Korean girls did better than Japanese girls in a certain period.  But she does not compare the performances of boys and girls which would after all be crucial to her boook.  But the appropriate website shows clearly that there is a striking difference between the genders.  Could that be why she did not tell us?<br /><br />Biology is actually making something of a comeback.  We now know that even one year old children have some moral views which could not possibly come from culture.  18 month old infants are helpful in ways in which chimpanzees never are.  So we are already born with a lot of hardware when we are born.  Part of that hardware is gender difference.<br /><br />But there is NO need here for female resentment.  Women do not typically commit massacres.  True, fewer women are mathematicians, but some are.  Julia Robinson was the president of the American Mathematical Society and made great contributions to Hilbert's tenth problem.  Some of her earlier work on Game theory is of the same level as Nash's.<br /><br />But interest in math does seem to be less among women, and most importantly, in the author of this book.  I know some of Julia Robinson's work and have even met her.  I doubt that Cordelia fine has read any of Julia Robinson's papers.  I have gone to a talk by a female mathematician (incidentally, a former student of mine) and the ENTIRE audience was male.  It is ironic that (some) women complain, \\"Why are there so few women in math?\\" but do not themselves go and listen to a talk by a mathematician, even a female one.  That is the way the worldis and America is only harming itself by fighting an emotional battle against nature.is and America is only harming itself by fighting an emotional battle against nature.
B0034G4OU4|4.0|The story begins with Liz failing out of two relationships, well aware of how each got the way it was but baffled as to why. So, in order to find herself, she goes looking in places she's never been.<br /><br />The 'Eat' part of the story take place in Rome, where Liz discovers the wonder of 'dolce far niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. Except that it's not nothing, it's full involvement in the little things of each moment, and in turning the biological demand for fuel into a kind of making love. The mouth-watering, full-screen shots of pasta, melon, turkey, and more show just what there is to love, including a drumstick moment that approaches the one in [[ASIN:B00005AUKE Tom Jones]] for sensuality. (In truth, this segment of the movie made me ashamed of the bland drink and stale popcorn I had inflicted on myself at the theater's concession stand.)<br /><br />Since I'm not in the \\"chick flick\\" demographic, the next two passages didn't do so much for me. Liz's next stop was India, where I hoped the culinary passion would play out among the complex flavors of India's cuisines. Although Liz brought a healthy appetite with her, the 'Eat', 'Pray', and 'Love' segments of the movie didn't overlap, and India marked the transition from 'Eat' to 'Pray'. As in any good spiritual journey, Liz encoutered new teachers during this phase, and not the ones she had expected. For reasons known only to Liz, the time in India came to its end, and she moved on to Bali and 'Love'. I was happy to see that 'Love' took many forms, and not just the mandatory romance.<br /><br />I'm more of a guy movie kind of guy, but I see my wife's movies almost as often as she sees mine. As estrogenic cinema goes, my taste tolerated this one quite well - but I'd come back to the 'Eat' portion of the movie any time. Four stars: not necessarily because of how it matched my preferences, but because how well it seemed to do what it wanted to.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

0307454541|5.0|I have read all three books in the Millenium trilogy, and they're all really entertaining, a real page turner! The main character Lisbeth Salander is an A-social 24-year old who has had many problems with the law and society. She has a photographic memory and is a world-class computer hacker. Lisbeth works when she feels like it, at a company called Milton, where she uses her hacking skills without the knowledge of her boss. The other man character Mikael Blomkvist who is the co-owner of millenium magazine, gets hired to do some undercover work to try and figure out what happened to Harriet Vanger, who has been missing and presumed dead for many years. An unlikely relationship happens between the two main characters when Mikael learns of Salanders unique skills, and hires her to help him find the answer.<br />  There are many twists and turns and it somewhat turns out to be a classic 'who done it' novel. This book kept me guessing the whole way, and the person who you'd least exspect turns out to be the madman..(Isn't it always that way?) Anyways it was hard to stop reading once I started! The two novels after this one are just as well told..(The second book, the most entertaining..) Which all in all makes this trilogy one of the best ever. I must say when I red the titles of these novels, I thought that they would be 'chick books' or maybe even a teenager book..But that's not the case. Although it may appeal to woman and teens as well, it definatly worked for me..A 24-year-old man..<br />  The one thing to me that I didn't care for was since the author was swedish and the book is translated, the names of the places and many characters are almost impossible to pronounce! I had to use my imagination and use my own created names, which worked fine for me.. I absolutely recommend this book, and the other two in the series. The author of these books passed away from a heart attack just after writing the last in this series, which is a shame because after I finished them, I instantly became a fan of Stieg Larsson!tantly became a fan of Stieg Larsson!

0393068382|5.0|I thought this was a most impressive and thorough overview of the research in this area, and it really does show how academics in this field are going to have to raise their game, and stop drawing truly dubious conclusions from experiments that raise so many question marks. And I hope that (like one previous academic reviewer, they won't just get cross and swat away this seriously researched and referenced book just because it's still readable!)  Is there any other field but gender in which there could be so many question marks over the quality of the research, and yet so many social conclusions being drawn - including in my own field - education. So thank God this book has come along. Every time I hear the words 'should be thinking of teaching them differently because they have different sorts of brains' I shall be better armed to argue.

B003L16FAE|3.0|When Predator first came out on blu-ray a few years ago, it looked horrible. There's really no other way to put it. Grain was all over the place, and it looked worse than the collector's edition dvd that had just come out a few years prior. How did it even get released on what's supposed to be the 'superior' format? I don't know. But when Predators was getting ready to hit theaters, they decided to go and release a new blu-ray, similar to how a lot of other movies/dvds do whenever a sequel or remake is about to come out in theaters. Needless to say, this is both a quick attempt to fix the picture quality, and sucker in the easy-to-sucker Predator fans who were hyped for the newest movie. Long story short, the picture quality of this blu-ray does, and doesn't look better than previous releases.    As for the movie itself, what is there to even say? By now, EVERYONE'S seen it whether it's the actual movie or from countless parodies and spoofs in other movies and online. The story of a group of top notch military dudes who go to the jungle for a special mission, only to be picked off one at a time by an invisible...well...Predator. If you want a movie with stuff blowing up and big guns, look no further than Predator. Even today, the film holds up pretty well, and as long as you're not some kind of movie snob, you should enjoy it. It's pure dumb sci-fi/action fun at its best, and introduced the world to what's still considered one of the coolest movie monsters ever. 'too bad none of the recent sequels did him justice.    Here's where things get a bit tricky- the picture quality. Where the first blu-ray had grain up the wazoo, the Ultimate Hunter edition looks MUCH cleaner. Unfortunately, they also went overboard with smoothing, and the majority of close ups with the actors are painful to watch. People look like they're made of wax. The classic opening where Arnold and his buddy do the hand shake/'look at our huge biceps' scene comes to mind immediately. When the cameragoes to shots of their faces, it looks like they're melting. Even worse is later on when Arnold is fighting for his life and making use of the jungle to get the upper hand on the Predator. Granted, a lot of people really won't care for the picture quality if they're just buying this because they didn't have it already and are more casual fans, but for those with an eye for detail, it's a big eye sore. Why didn't they take time to make things look right? I appreciate the grain being removed, but I almost want to say the last blu-ray version had better detail. Even some shots with the jungle background look a bit messy. As for the audio, it's much better, but still missing that extra punch that it deserves. You get a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, as well as a 5.1 in Spanish and French if you want.    The special features are mostly carried over from the collector's edition dvd, with a couple of new things to help promote Predators more than add to the original movie's extras. First up is the commentary track with the director, and I'm sorry but this is one of the worst commentary tracks I've ever heard. The director sounds like Mr. Plinkett from Red Letter Media, and sometimes just ends up watching the movie without saying anything. I will give this track some credit though- he mentions that they tried to use a monkey in a red suit at first for the invisible Predator segments, to make him look more fluid when running/swinging through the trees. But the monkey was embarrassed whenever he'd be in the suit, and just run off and hide in a tree. 'pretty funny. The rest of the extras are the usual on-the-set interviews with the cast and crew where they share some fun stories and talk about working on the movie. 'nothing too special, aside from a great trick Arnold pulled on Jesse Ventura that led Ventura to think his arms were bigger than Arnold's, only to find out that Arnold's were 3 inches bigger. The only extras worth mentioning though are the text commentary, which has TONS of information, and is much better than the actual director commentary, and the Evolution of Predator feature, where we get to see the original Predator costume that was so disturbingly bad that they had to go and get Stan Winston to create the masterpiece we all know and love.    If you still have the collector's edition dvd, you might want to just stick with that, unless you absolutely have to have all your movies on blu-ray, or if you don't own the movie yet. I'm not too mad about my purchase since I got it for a lot less than the standard price, but that doesn't change the fact that this disc was rushed just to help get some extra bucks from Predator fans eager to see the newest installment in the franchise. If you want to see just how overdone the smoothing is, you can easily do an image search for this blu-ray: Predator Ultimate Hunter Edition and see for yourself. But for the casual fans, it won't be a big deal. Blu-ray enthusiasts who go around on blu-ray message boards going on about how the tiniest problem on a disc is insulting, stay away from this.

0345479092|5.0|After reading so many books on newborn care, Tracy Hogg's was hands down the best one!  The baby-wearing, demand feeding, co-sleeping craze right now does not necessarily jive with everyone's lifestyle, and Tracy Hogg helps parents know it's okay to choose a lifestyle that is conducive to the whole family while emphasizing sensitivity to the baby's individuality.<br /><br />Though she whole heartedly endorses breastfeeding as the best nutrition for baby, she doesn't make mothers feel guilty if for whatever reason they choose not to breastfeed.  And some mothers can't breastfeed, so bottle feeding is an appropriate choice too (and it doesn't have to be formula of course).  I agree that a few of her comments about formula seem ignorant, but you can't expect to agree with EVERYTHING another human being says.  Contrary to what other reviewers try to twist her message regarding feeding to say, Ms. Hogg does not encourage denying a hungry baby food or making the baby abide by a strict clock schedule.  She encourages a common-sense approach that forms the basis for her EASY routine, which helps new parents and baby communicate better about the baby's needs.  Of course it's essential to demand feed around the clock during the first few weeks of a baby's life (if a preemie, it would be much longer).  But after a while, a baby can thrive on a routine that helps baby and parents anticipate better what's best for baby.  That routine doesn't have to be regimented to the clock, as just like us, a baby may consume more or less during a feeding and therefore may need to eat sooner or later than before.<br /><br />Though her classifications for babies may seem over-simplified, it at least awakens the reader's mind to the necessary reality of embracing whatever personality your baby has and the necessity of getting to know how your baby uniquely responds to your care and their environment.  If anything, she gives you some helpful ways to observe your baby to understand him or her better.<br /><br />You can tell she has spent years caring for newborns and helping families adjust and welcome a new baby.  You can also tell she loves and respects babies tremendously.  Her breadth of experience has fostered her moderate approach to newborn care.  I am saddened when I see so many negative reviews on this wonderful book that endeavors to help each parent connect with their unique baby and to help each baby take their place as part of a family.can tell she has spent years caring for newborns and helping families adjust and welcome a new baby.

0439023513|3.0|To be truthful, I can't say I was counting the days for this book to come out.  I did read the first two, but only because my niece is a huge fan of the series, so I simply borrowed them from her after she finished them, as I did the third.  So, to begin with, this series was never worth spending money on in my perspective, especially in this recession.  I mean, who's going to spend $20 on a book, when your fridge and pantry are empty and you can't even afford to buy gas to go to work?  Consider yourself lucky if you have a minimum-wage job.<br /><br />That aside, I do have to admit that the first two parts of Mockingjay were pretty riveting.  I simply couldn't put the book down, hence the three-star rating.  I don't know if it's because it's been an overwhelmingly long, hot summer with nothing to do, or if the story actually does deserve a bit of credit.<br /><br />The one thing that kept me reading was how much I was able to identify with Katniss and her situation.  I don't know about other readers, but, at least for me, life is a lot like it was for Katniss.  You literally have to fight to stay alive and often go hungry because there's no money to buy groceries.  Your own family members turn against you because they, too, are hungry, so everyone is desperate and frustrated, feeling cornered and fighting off insanity.  No matter how qualified you are, you still can't find a job, not even at places like Walmart or McDonald's, because there's far more applicants than there are job openings.<br /><br />In the mean time, you see the rich and privileged on TV wasting money, living extravagantly, selling millions of records or books, or whatever products they put out, while you have to sleep on the floor because you don't even have a bed.  It opens your eyes to the many similarities between the US and Panem.  Still, we get the point loud and clear.  No revolution, no matter how noble or glorious it may be, is ever going to fix anything.  People are just going to get hurt or die, and all for what?<br /><br />Power will corrupt even the most charismatic of leaders.  You can't trust anyone to have your back, because they're so hungry and broke, they'll stab you or rob you blind for a measly loaf of bread.  The people you used to admire fall apart before your very eyes, succumbing to depression and apathy.  Helplessness and hopelessness spread faster than an epidemic, and you find yourself just wanting to fall asleep and never wake up, or remain in a hospital bed sedated by a lifetime supply of morphling.  Katniss can't be blamed for hiding and curling up in closets.  What else is there to do?<br /><br />Something inside you just dies when you see so many of your loved ones metaphorically blown to bits by the constant lack of basic survival needs.  Welfare offices are bursting at the seams with desperate people whose pride and dignity have been swallowed up by starvation and unemployment.  People cry out for jobs and food, and all the government employees will do is call security to have them escorted out of the building.  What ever happened to human compassion?<br /><br />So to those of you who criticize Katniss for having become an empty, numb shell with no fight left in her, I suggest you stop by your nearest welfare office and listen to the stories of the people who sit there for 9 to 10 hours just to have the county employees treat them worse than animals.  Heck, they may as well gas them all.  At least that'll put them out of their misery, and the hunger and the pain and the lack will finally stop.<br /><br />Those of you with a home and a job and a bed and a fridge full of food should consider yourselves lucky.  That means you haven't seen the harsh reality of the real United States of America.  My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, why won't you hear your children cry?  Perhaps you're too busy manufacturing multi-billion dollar weapons of mass destruction so you can continue bullying other countries with your false ideals of freedom.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but the Capitol and its excesses seem to me a little too similar to our federal government and current economic situation.  Katniss actually deserves a lot of credit for keeping it together enough to marry and have children.  Either that, or Collins just had to slap on the obligatory happy ending to a story that, realistically, doesn't allow for one.ou, but the Capitol and its excesses seem to me a little too similar to our federal government and current economic situation.

0374158460|5.0|I didn't read any reviews before I finished, because I didn't want to be influenced.      I liked \\"The Corrections\\" very much, but I LOVED \\"Freedom\\". I loved every page of this book.  They both have very unlikeable characters and dysfunctional family, but this time, Franzen let me believe in \\"goodness\\"in each character.   Funny thing was, I was thinking about Tolstoy before Patty read \\"War and Peace\\" in the book (I didn't think about Updike like other reviewers mentioned). Thorough a family saga, Franzen gives a vivid portrait of contemporary America.     Some may dislike the hopeful ending. Especially young readers.  But, ending such a great literally fiction with a hopeful and forgiving note is a lot more difficult than you can imagine. And, Franzen accomplished it so beautifully. I couldn't stop crying in the end.     This is the best book I have read this year (or even the last 5 years).     To those who gave one star because they didn't like the kindle price, please do me a favor and remove your review.   Authors DO NOT have a control over pricing. Why do you punish authors?     Also, Franzen spent almost 9 years to write this book. If you read it, you'll notice every word in 562 pages is carefully chosen, and there's no unnecessary line. Do you still think 12.99 is too expensive for a kindle version? I don't think so.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|So, I am not the biggest fan of how the show ended. It was a little too emotional, or spiritual, or cliche, or something along those lines. I would have preferred they prevented the accident and in another life they lived their lives, became friends through other means, and lived normal lives. Up until the finale, the show could have gone any number of directions. The season still deserves all 5 stars in my opinion. Other than the finale, the season was still amazing and I would recommend it to anybody. Season 6 had some of the best episodes of the series and is a must have for any Lost fan, especially those with the previous 5 seasons. And for those of you who may be curious, the packaging is similar in style to season 5, not the first 4 seasons unfortunately.

0316098337|5.0|This is the first book I've read in years that I alternately didn't want to put down and didn't want to finish too fast. Told from the perspective of a five-year-old child whose world has been confined to a shed and his mother with occasional visits from their captor, what might have been trite or sensational, is instead a sensitive, seemingly well thought out portrait of a badly skewed life. Fiction, that, sadly, might be based on real-life events, given recent headlines.
B001TW68P4|5.0|The Turtles were an outstanding group. In fact, they produced so many great tunes that it's impossible for me to pick just one song of theirs and say it's my only favorite! They had a great sound and they made the airwaves sizzle when these songs were initially released. Their music still sounds good today; it's incredible how it all stands the test of time. In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />Of course I have my favorites on this album as you will, too. \\"Happy Together\\" starts off the album with a strong Turtles song that offers up a catchy beat and they deliver this one with panache! They never let go of a single superfluous note and that's impressive. \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" is also very well done; and I like the way they use the modulations between major and minor keys along with that amazing guitar and percussion! There's yet another gem in \\"She'd Rather Be with Me\\" which was always one of my preferred songs by The Turtles--and how's about that beat? \\"You Baby\\" is also excellent music.<br /><br />\\"Elenore\\" is beautifully poignant and a true classic; and listen for The Turtles to do a wonderful job on other songs including \\"She's My Girl;\\" \\"Outside Chance\\" with that timeless `60s sound I love so much; the hit \\"You Showed Me;\\" \\"Can I Get to Know You Better;\\" \\"Me About You;\\" the passionate \\"You Don't Have to Walk in the Rain;\\" \\"You Know What I Mean;\\" \\"Makin' My Mind Up;\\" \\"Grim Reaper of Love\\" and \\"Guide for the Married Man.\\" There's even a track of their commercial for the Chevrolet Camaro!<br /><br />There are other greatest hits CDs out there for fans of The Turtles; but this is a strong edition. I highly recommend this for fans of the group and even newcomers to the incredible artistry of The Turtles.

The film is just as fun as the music and vice versa.  The soundtrack holds up to all the great soundtracks, meaning it has its own story to tell without the film.

159448385X|5.0|This novel is not for the faint of heart.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is an emotionally wrenching and brutal story of life in Afghanistan.  It is told through the eyes of two women who live through the ravages of constant war and extremist Islam during pre-Soviet times, the Soviet invasion, civil war, and the Taliban.  Although emotionally difficult to read, this is a very important work in what it does for raising awareness about the harsh life for the people of Afghanistan.  This book will break your heart but it is a book that needs to be read.

The Writers of this show managed to introduce new characters with plots that have enough twists, turns and intelligent dialog to keep me interested and coming back for more. I have no doubt this could have gone on for many more seasons, assuming the writing remained challenging.     Interestingly, any lack of viewer following maybe due to a lack of promotion. Frankly, I just stumbled onto the show as it was closing. Luckily DVD's are available and I gobbled up the entire series with a ravenous appetite and now I am hungry for more.
185984054X|5.0|Yes, much of the material Hitchens provides for the reader is already known. However, more isn't. To collect all of the terrible things Mother Teresa did to the people under her care in one book, is a service to those who blindly believe her lay canonization by the press, magazines, and other news media. There were some things which infuriated me about her more than others: her refusal to help those in excruciating pain; her second- to third-rate care while seeking out first-rate care for herself, and her acceptance of the accolades which were thrown her way. This was not a humble woman.<br /><br />Hitchens' research does a service to everyone who really works to help the \\"least of these.\\" Saints do not always have good public relations machines, or at least, not as good as hers. They don't want them; they want only to serve. Thank God for them.<br /><br />Read Carlos Flauta's excellent review. He says it much more cogently than I, for which I'm grateful. Then buy this book as well as his one on Henry Kissinger. He's trying to break up myths, for which we ALL should be grateful.

0385341008|5.0|This book is told in the form of a series of letter from and to Juliet Ashton who is a freelance writer. Juliet is approached initially by a gentleman from Guernsey immediately after the end of World War II as he happened to get a hold of a book that used to be owned by Juliet. Since Guernsey is out of the normal way, and the author of the book in question is not well known, Dawsey asks Juliet for help and this leads to the whole fascinating set of circumstances related in this novel.<br /><br />Guernsey is part of the Channel Islands and belongs to Great Britain, even though you can see France from their shores, but not England. During World War 2, all of the islands were taken over by the Nazis and occupied for the duration. The British did not liberate those islands until early in 1945 and this story is written in 1946 as the island rebuilds and reestablishes itself as a liberated part of Europe. As Juliet learns more about what took place on the island, she is drawn more and more to it and the people who populate it and ultimately moves there to write a book about the experiences of it's people under the Occupation.<br /><br />What she learns, and how she learns it, is the main part of the book. I will not give away too many plot details, but will tell you that as she gets more and more involved with the people, she learns of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society; how it was formed; named; why it was formed; and the remarkable story of the founder and other members of this society.<br /><br />The book is very easy reading and draws you into it quite rapidly. I found myself unwilling to put it down as I was reading more and more of these short letters and attempting to understand the various personal relationships between and amongst the remarkable people described. It was a nice read and a fun way to spend a few hours and I was not disappointed as the plot evolved and thickened. There are many funny moments, as well as sad moments in the book, and the storytelling part of the book is first rate. I would definitely enjoy reading more stories like this - even if they do not employ the literary technique of telling it via letters - but unfortunately, the main author died before this book was published. Five stars for sure.the book is first rate.

If you are a right wing nutjob who pretends to be a christian every Sunday, this is not your movie.  This is along the lines of Beerfest and American Pie as far as humor.  We watch it often just to get a chuckle.<br /><br />They still need a blu-ray version.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|I passed on this film when it was in theaters.  I guess I thought it was going to be all shooting and car chases.  Well there was a certain amount of those.  But it was so much more!  A very clever script, brilliantly brought to life by a terrific cast.    I love Robert Downey, Jr. although I fell out of love temporarily at Sherlock Holmes.  I was very happy to see him in top of his form.  He's perfect as the hapless petty criminal who stumbles, literally into a job as an actor, and a huge mess.  Downey and Kilmer spar beautifully as the crook and the gay PI who fall in together to make sense of their revolting predicament.  Michelle Monaghan is just right as Downey's love interest.  She's good hearted and cute and really dumb at times (manages to cut off Downey's finger) and brilliant and heroic at other times.  I'd love to see a sequal with the two of them.    The dialog is as clever and snappy as anything you'll find in a 30's screwball comedy and there are some hilarious sight gags.  I loved it when Downey finds himself under the table with the pink-wigged girl.     I did get lost in some of the plot twists but it didn't make any difference.  The three stars are so compelling that the plot just serves as a vehicle for watching them do their stuff.    I hope this film gets the audience it deserves.  I had more genuine laughs here than at anything I've seen in quite a while.
0439023513|1.0|This book was so different from the first two; those I couldn't put down but Mockingjay, well, I had a hard time finishing it.  It was so dang depressing.  First of all, the characters that I'd come to know and care about were not the same people.  The things I loved about Katniss in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were her strength and wisdom.  Those are missing in this book.  She acts like a moody teenager - rebellious, whiny, weak-minded, shirking responsibilities, hiding from everyone and no-one - she wore on me quickly.  Gale did not match the image I had constructed of him while reading the first two books: a quiet, strong loner; here he is a bloodthirsty warmonger.  And don't even get me started on Peeta.  What Collins did to Peeta is completely unforgivable.    Secondly, the book is a jumble of action and boredom.  Some points that seem to be important to the plot are glossed over and others are rushed and not explained well.  The pace of the story is frenetic at times and then crawls over the next scene which makes reading it unpleasant. Then throw in the gratuitous deaths and mutilations of many secondary characters that I had grown to care about and it almost feels like a slap in the face.  Awful, awful to read.  I felt emotionally distant from this book and I really didn't care what happened to Katniss in the end.  Which I suppose is a good thing since the ending is utterly ridiculous.      The Hunger Games was plotted so well and, in contrast, Mockingjay is just a mess.  I think Ms. Collins should have taken more time to write it, or her editors should have done a better job with the pace and the character consistency.  With one book they managed to turn a gripping series into a total disappointment.  I can't believe this is the same author.  The Hunger Games was a fantastic read, Catching Fire was a decent sequel, Mockingjay was, well, a travesty.  It could have been so much more.  Do yourself a favor and stop at book 1.  Let your imagination take you to life after Katniss' and Peeta's win in the arena.  You will be much better off.
0374158460|3.0|Excellent writing when dealing with the painfully intimate and intricate details of adolescence, marriage, childrearing, infidelity and romantic yearnings.  In fact, it approaches the true-to-life fictional style used so successfully by Tom Wolfe in the \\"Bonfire of the Vanities,\\" and \\"A Man in Full.\\"    Yet, this saga ominously hits a brick wall when it becomes enmeshed with any number of environomental, social and political issues (incluing mining and overpopulation) that seem to go on for far too long and which consume an excessive amount of time and space.  Very \\"preachy\\", didactic and repetitive if you will.    As a result, we are confronted with a lengthy novel that is only partially rewarding.  It is constucted on cycles of excitement and tedium which make for an erratic reading experience.  You really have to invest a good deal of time and effort searching for the literary nuggets that make the effort worthwhile in the end.

B0036TGSR6|3.0|Roman Polanski hates America. Really hates it. Which is a bit of an ingrate attitude, seeing as America has given him so many opportunities to direct films in Hollywood, using American stars. Thanks to America, Roman Polanski is an internationally-famous auteur, and not just a regional European product. Mr. Polanski is also internationally-infamous for his conviction of statuatory rape of an American 13-year-old, on American soil, and that more than anything, explains his anti-American bias. Even if he does like to dress up his personal vendetta in 'political' clothing. Quite a way to treat a country who's been so good to him and who was instrumental in creating the nation of Israel. Go figure.    The film is an adaptation of 'The Ghost' by Robert Harris, the screenplay of which Polanski co-wrote with the author. So, the political ideas herein are not solely Polanski's, but seeing as Harris shares Roman's anti-American bias, it becomes easy to see why Polanski would have been drawn to this project. You've probably heard the plot: a talented ghost writer between jobs (Ewan McGregor--in the style of \\"Rebecca\\" our main protagonist is never given a name) is hired as a last-minute replacement for another ghost writer whose body washed up on the beach while working on the memoirs of the former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Despite misgivings, our ghost takes the job, only to be immediately mugged by thugs who think he is carrying the manuscript. The manuscript is kept under lock and key at the PM's palatial compound on Montauk, to which our ghost goes. He has to stay at the house because the manuscript is not permitted to leave the room it's kept in. While he's there working, strange undercurrents swirl around him in the house, and the story breaks in the international media that a former cabinet minister of the PM has accused him of war crimes for his complicity in Iraqi torture. The ghost soon discovers that by continuing work on this project, there is a very good chance he will share his predecessor's fate. But what he, and we don't understand is, why? What is in the PM's past, buried deep in his memoir, that people will kill in order to keep it hidden?    Now, I will give credit where credit is due: no one excels Polanski in the tension-building set-up, or in creating an atmosphere of increasingly-ratcheted up suspense. As in his Frantic (1988) with Harrison Ford, he puts a guy who is professionally accomplished yet politically naive into a sinister situation where he is completely out of his element, and turns him loose to see how he will cope. The creepy visual effects of the gray winter beach and sky outside the PM's sterile, modern house that seems entirely made of glass create this sense of forboding and opressive isolation that serves the story well. And, in whatever capacity the director deserves credit for these things, he ellicits terrific perfomances from his cast. Ewan McGregor anchors the movie, since he's in every scene. The character McGregor gives us here goes against his usual charismatic and self-confident type: something of a lost and passive man who is just drifting along with events, but watching him carry this movie, and seeing the physicality he has developed convinces me that the rumors that he was considered a leading contender for the reboot of the James Bond franchise aren't as far-fetched as previously thought.  Pierce Brosnan, best known as an affable light comedian and action star really displays his dramatic chops as the embattled PM. Here, Brosnan is portraying a man who is considered, though telegenic and popular, a political lightweight, an 'actor' rather than a serious political mind. Mr. Brosnan may have found some parallels between his character and himself: in drama school, the impossibly handsome Pierce was affectionately lampooned by his fellow classmates with the nickname \\"Hollywood\\"--everyone predicted, rightly, that his looks would make him a huge star, but on the flip side, nobody is willing to take anyone that good looking seriously, or give them credit for more than superficial ambitions. Guess Mr. Brosnan has been able to have his cake and eat it too, thereby proving that he is more than just a pretty face.  It is impossible not to draw parallels between his fictional Adam Lang and Tony Blair, who despite being beloved for pulling his nation through the Princess Diana crisis and being elected a resounding three times by his fellow Britons, is in hindsight treated by the media intelligentsia (of which Polanski and Harris are part) with withering scorn as some sort of lapdog to two American presidents. The American government and the CIA are supposed to be the real baddies here. McGregor and Brosnan are supported by a cadre of reliable actors doing the kinds of parts they do best, most notably Tom Wilkinson and Olivia Williams. Kim Cattrall (aka Samantha on SATC) plays the PM's efficient secretary and not-so-secret mistress. She looks great, but whatever accent she's attempting drifts in and out making her something of a caricature.    As strictly a piece of suspense, The Ghost Writer delivers a moody, mostly effective thriller, though portions of it could be tighter. I dozed off a time or two before things really got going. But ultimately it's impossible to divorce the action from the political subtext, and there are so many holes in the logic that the piece sinks under the weight of its own self-importance. Had this been made a generation ago, in the height of Cold War paranoia, it would have seemed to have a bit more heft. At the final reveal, we are left going . . .Is THAT it? Really? In the end, Polanski's final card, which he seems to slap down on the table with an \\"A HA!\\" falls flat because it doesn't even make sense. Just prior to that, there is a stunt involving an anagram of sorts that was put to much more chilling use in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" with Scrabble tiles. To trot out a similar device again feels tired, and inthis case is dramatically flabby.    In the final analyisis of this movie, I can't say that Mr. Polanski will have won himself any new friends in the American government who are already none too fond of him, but that the British government has an even greater reason to be ticked off with Roman. Apparently Mr. Polanski does not have a high opinion of Great Britain either. Which makes him a darling in France, certainment!    I found this disappointing after having looked forward to it for quite a while. It earns 4 stars for the production design, but on the whole, only a three-star effort.
0740745271|5.0|I am an older amblyopic person with a \\"lazy\\" right eye - diagnosed when I was 5 years old.  I have tried to see Magic Eye images since they came out but was successful only in seeing them \\"punched out\\" because I crossed instead of diverged my eyes.

Now I can correctly view the images in the other Magic Eye books I own. I am still hoping someday to see in 3D as most people do.

0307454541|3.0|The mystery of the missing granddaughter was well constructed, interesting and very convoluted.  All the details of the corporate conflicts, not so much.  The portrait of the small Swedish village and its odd assortment of characters was quite good. The writing style was adequate, but certainly would not qualify as literary.  Often the wording was awkward which could be the translator rather than the author.<br /><br />BUT, anyone who is disturbed by vivid and detailed descriptions of extreme cruelty to people and animals, or by deviant sex, should avoid this book.  There is a lot of it, and it is gruesome.

0439023513|2.0|This review is from: Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games) (Hardcover)     Rue came to a better end than this series did.    I held off reading HG and CF thinking the YA distinction wouldn't appeal to me. Then I happened to pick up Hunger Games and tore through it in one day. Immediately read through Catching Fire and queued up with everyone else awaiting Mockingjay.     It took me three days to read the book because I kept setting it down and saying a little prayer that it would somehow improve when I came back to it. No such luck.     It was so slow, meandering; the characters were unsympathetic (even familiar faces); and the end was unsatisfying. Collins had written Katniss as such an interesting character for me: both flawed and struggling yet strong and tenacious. What happened? I didn't expect Katniss to remain unchanged but her transformation through book 3 seemed bizarre and disjointed.     How I miss the thrill of the first two books.

B001J6NZGU|5.0|This is a movie where the script is number one, there are no men in this movie, and so you need to really understand how women, at least these women, communicate with each other. The storyline is weak, but the acting and the script more than make up for it, Meg Ryan and Anette Bening make it that much more powerful.

My comments on Alexandra go for Catherine Frot ditto.

B001Y8WAJQ|5.0|saxon released denim and leather in 1981.denim and leather was saxon,s fourth album.denim and leather may arguably be saxon,s best album ever.every song on this album is great!there are just NO filler songs on it in my opinion.also on the tour for this album saxon recorded their first great live album titled ;the eagle has landed.i was reading the liner notes of this remaster and singer biff byford said that he thinks of the early saxon albums denim and leather was the best!there is also a remix of 20,000 ft which was the b-side of the never surrender single.for me the great tracks are[and there are very many]'never surrender,princess of the night,out of control,denim and leather,midnight rider,and the bands played on,fire in the sky[about nuclear war] and play it loud  these songs are great reasons to buy this album.also noteable on this remastered edition is the inclusion of six live cuts which include,machine gun,midnight rider and never surrender to name a few.though most of these songs are also on the eagle has landed they are a good document of what a great live band saxon was and is.this album,wheels of steel,power and the glory,strong arm and crusader would be great first albums to get if you,re a new comer to saxon. if you,re an old timer you know these are classic must haves from saxon!!

The script is clever, the action is intense, and the violence is cartoonishly operatic. I was disappointed to see Nicolas Cage (hands down, my least favorite actor, especially since he robbed Sean Penn of his first Oscar--I mean, \\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" REALLY? Anyway, I digress...) in this film, but I was satisfied with his fate. I'm not usually a fan of violent chopsocky flicks, but \\"Kick-Ass\\" was definitely a cut above--not your run-of-the-mill wannabe teenage superhero flick at all--I'm eager for the sequel.
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|saxon released power and the glory in 1983.power and the glory was saxon,s fifth studio album.power and the glory is chock full of classic saxon rockers!!saxon,s long time drummer pete gill left the band before saxon started to record this album.in my opinion saxon,s first six albums or so are the best work of their carreer.however i will qualify that statement by saying i have,nt really heard much of saxon,s post crusader era albums so i,m sure there are some very good moments on much of their albums post crusader.saxon has been making records since 1979 and they just got better and better with each album by the time power and glory came along they already had done such greats as wheels of steel,strong arm of the law,the excellent denim and leather and their first live album the eagle has landed.that being said song for song there is almost nothing you could call filler material on this great album also notable is the fact that saxon toured with iron maiden on this tour imagine that for a double bill!!for me the best cuts are;power and the glory,warrior[which kicks a@@!!]watching the sky,the eagle has landed[about the first moon landing]nightmare,redline,this town rocks and also on this remastered edition is a live version of denim and leather and the outtakes from the power and glory sessions turn out the lights stand up and rock to name a few.i have been a fan of saxon since the early 80,s since denim and leather if you wanted great well written and played melodic power metal saxon is in the top 5 or 10.this album,denim and leather,wheels of steel,the eagle has landed and strong arm of the law would be great starting points for those that are new to saxon.if you,re a long time fan you already know these albums are classics!!play it loud if you get this especially warrior!!!
B000RLCJ5Q|5.0|How could this go wrong?  Even though I already had \\"London Calling\\" and \\"Remote Control\\" from their respective albums, this compilation is astoundingly good.  The energy, the innovation, the anger.  It's all there.  My only gripe is that it's not chronological, but that is a small matter.  I was less familiar with latter-day Clash, and this is a great starting point for delving into their later career.

B002ZG9846|5.0|This is a great movie. However, it is NOT for children or those easily offended. There is quite a bit of profanity and violence. It is funny, well-paced and somewhat intense, with graphic violence and sharp dialogue. Fans of Quenton Tarantino or the Coen brothers should appreciate this film.
0307454541|5.0|The characters in this story are well crafted.  Easy to visualize and very interesting.  The plots and sub-plots were complicated and enticing.  It takes a little time to get into the story as the author builds a history of the plots involved but after that is established you can hardly put the book down through the exciting conclusion.<br /><br />Since the storyline is placed in Sweden, it was somewhat difficult to identify many of the countryside, corporate entities, villages, etc.  but still the book was one of the best I've read in years.  A real thriller.

B003LPV960|5.0|As I suspected \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is a delight on BLU RAY with a vastly improved picture quality that is quite beautiful at times.<br /><br />The bonus features are generous too:<br />1.

She arrives when called for (title above) looking grotesque and fearsome (17 nannies have been dispatched by the children in varying ways since their beloved mother's passing). But Nanny McPhee is not about to be sent packing by any screaming brat. With her strange way of arriving in a room without using doors and her walking stick that seems to have magical powers, she is a force to be reckoned with. And then there's her disappearing ugliness - Nanny McPhee seems to grow prettier as the children stop being horrid and start behaving and doing good things. And on it goes to its lovely snowbound ending...<br /><br />Nanny McPhee is actually an incredibly moral little tale and has a delight to it that is very hard to get right in a kid's movie. Both Colin Firth and the lovely Kelly MacDonald are superb as the well-matched couple that can't see that they were made for each other, while Emma Thompson is both funny and beautifully luminous (perhaps she's an angel working on behalf of an absent mum?). Throw in the fabulously crass Celia Imrie as a truly wicked marriage gold-digger who will see all the children sent off to an orphanage and Angela Lansbury as a bumbling, but well-meaning aunt - and it all just so works.<br /><br />To sum up - as a replacement for your old DVD - or as a new purchase for the kids and adults alike - this Blu Ray reissue is recommended wholeheartedly - and it's reasonably priced online too.<br /><br />A rather lovely little movie really...well-meaning aunt - and it all just so works.

0451228731|2.0|People who's taste I really admire wrote some good words in reviewing this book. And the ingredients are here to make a first rate story. The writing is solid in its craftsmanship, the characters are good for genre writing, and the story itself... well for the most part its a good idea.<br /><br />Some one here said \\"If you know even just a little about AI, encryption, computer networks, gaming and internet technology you're going to LOVE this book.\\"... if you know \\"a little\\" this is a book you will enjoy. If you know more than that, it gets ridiculous fast. I was trying to think of an analogy before I sat down to write this. An analogy between Daemon and other technology based books/movies from 20 years ago. The closest I could remember was this film where a guy buys a new computer and this computer falls jealously in love with him. You have to remember that this is back in the day, when PC's couldn't support images because they only had one color, an eyesore green. Supposedly, this computer was so 'smart', that it was able to fall in love with its owner, become jealous over his girlfriend, and then try to kill her. Why I'm saying this is because 25 years ago, people thought computers were capable of something like this. & it seems silly now that we look back on it, an IBM with a hard drive 1/100000000th the size of your current computer could rationally think on its own... I guess the main thing that was getting to me was that this novel is just going to seem so silly in a few years.<br /><br />OK, I am not taking away any points for what I just said. I feel strongly that this novel falls apart entirely half way through. It starts off decently enough. Sobol, this super genius evil dude computer game designer dies and with his death, a 'Daemon' comes to life. The daemon is by definition \\"A program or process that sits idly in the background until it is invoked to perform its task\\". & now that it has been invoked, its task is to DESTROY THE WORLD!!!<br /><br />So the story primarily flips from Sebeck, a detective who becomes embroiled in this story because he is the officer who responded to the scene of the crime in the first place. Ross, a mysterious ex-Russian mob computer genius, & a couple of other characters who are 'drafted' by Sobol.<br /><br />For an author who spends so much time jumping from one character to another, Suarez does an ok job of it. Mostly I say this because he does not end his chapters with mini cliff hangers. Instead, he unfolds entire plot pushing bits of information along over the course of a chapter, which is refreshing from a readers standpoint and unusual considering that its become a standard to end chapters these days at the highest point of suspense.<br /><br />I think what finally got to me, was that this is a pretty boring story when you come right down to it. It felt so terribly scripted. I felt like everything was falling into place exactly like it was supposed to. This is one of those stories where your reading and you want to start saying \\"and then this happened and then this...\\" and they happen. I'm not sure if Im getting my point across. For me, the main ingredient of a 'seat of your pants thriller' is to have the unexpected constantly thrust upon you. This story felt like Suarez read a whole lot of military thrillers, cobbled together the main plot points, and based a story around them.<br /><br />Ok, as I said, people I highly respect disagree with what I am saying. They very much enjoyed this story. You probably will too.ps from Sebeck, a detective who becomes embroiled in this story because he is the officer who responded to the scene of the crime in the first place.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|I know that this book is alot off the story of Alice through the looking Glass but it is a DISNEY classic and after all how many books get turned into one of them? I have been in the U.K. now for 2 &1/2 years now and every year they have sales on ALL the Disney films BUT this 1!!!!  THIS happens to be a great classic and if ya have any imagination at all then ya knwo it has nothing to do with drugs or poisen or B.S. as that but it simply has to do with a bored lil girl who falls asleep and dreams.  Thanks to Disney for keeping the dream alive with this classic and to Amazon. COM for making it possible for me to FINALLY get !!!  HAPPY UN- ANNIVERSARY!!! VERY HAPPY AMERICAN IN ENGLAND!!!
B000E41MS6|5.0|Words can't describe....(well yeah they can) about how great this series is. At first I was skeptical about it. I came across it on [...] when i was trying to find a song and Doctor who was in the background so i had to see what it was all about. After watching 2 episodes i was hooked! I highly recommend the first season....now the 2nd season i don't know because another Doctor is involved but i don't know how well he'll do. All i can say is in my opinion nobody can beat Christopher:-). This is a great show...Simply Fantastic!
B001QWBM62|4.0|It sucks batteries quickly when not in stamina-mood.    -Stamina mood- is good for recording audio with the on-board mics but it has some operating mood limitations.. If you are working with a shotgun-mic like I do (I'm using it for production sound and filming with a Canon D5MII) you have to use the normal mood..    -4 Stars- only because of the rapid battery consuming otherwise I'm very happy with the sound quality and it is very easy to use. I took it out of the box and was up and running in few minutes..   -The quality of the Zoom H4n itself is very good and solid.    I use a rechargeable battery kit -around $13 amazon prime- and I solved \\"battery problem\\". If I would have to shoot all day with no interruptions using -normal mood- I charge my 4 batteries + extra 2 to be safe and the \\"game is done\\".    -Production sound with the Canon D5 Mark II:  After carefully see what's on the market I decided to have \\"top quality\\" sound for my productions without spending a fortune nor hiring professional sound technicians.  *built-in Canon D5MII mic*   There are devices you can connect straight to the camera for more then $300 that work with experimental firmwire AT YOUR OWN RISK and apparently they offer good sound quality although you are limited to one stereo track (could be a mix of two mics connected to one of these devices which connects to the camera body using the Mic input) and have to take a $2500 risk..   If you simply connect a mic to the camera, no matter how good your mic is you will get LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE which is understandable since the camera wasn't originally designed to shoot pro video..  The capability of the Zoom H4n of recording 4 TRACKS simultaneously (2 mono with the input mics XLR and one stereo with the on board mic it's pretty good.. Lot's of good functionality such as Low cut reduction and custom recording adjustments on the different tracks.    Conclusions:  If you are not a sound technician and have no knowledge of sound at all.  If you want to film Features, Shorts, Documentaries, interviews, etc. capturing great sound for your project and you are a one-man-crew or you can count on friend-help to boom for you.  If you don't want to spend a fortune in equipment or pro sound technicians but still want to get TOP QUALITY SOUND.  The Zoom H4n is the way to go.    Certainly it takes sometime to sync the sound in post but it is well worth it when you will hear it loud and clear.    I hope this will be helpful..

1423113381|5.0|This caught my eye for the Egyptian references. Although I'm decades beyond \\"young adult\\" status, I grew up on the YA books on Egypt by Eloise Jarvis McGraw and the YA books by Robert A. Heinlein, and this was enjoyable and entertaining. I enjoyed the in-depth description of Egyptian gods and goddesses, LOVED Bast, and the interplay between brother and sister was nicely done.  A reviewer felt that the characters acted overly \\"mature\\" for their ages, but when I think of well-loved YA adults from the 60s forward, they also were smart, thoughtful, courageous, and struggled with life and death decisions. This book depicted some pretty amazing visuals that were a treat to mentally conjure up; it was surprisingly easy to see the different structures, palaces, etc. Other things that stood out: the New Orleans scenes, the respect for the kids' bi-racial diversity, the emotional connection between the secondary characters.     The beginning format dropped the reader right into the middle of the action, which was fun: \\"If you're reading this, it means you're already in danger\\", which is a nice construct for a YA book and breaks the fourth wall in an engaging way.
0470601787|3.0|For a design book there is far too much text and no colour pictures...I am very disappointed
0439023513|5.0|No spoilers in this review. I hate it when reviewers do that! I really liked this series in total. Thought the first book was really good. Think this one is probably the weakest of the series, but a very good finish overall. Anyone looking for a fairy-tale ending to the series is missing the whole point, I think. The author is looking at the effects of war, violence, autocratic government, and being a pawn in the games of the powerful and amoral. The point is that if you make it through this meat-grinder, you are damaged by it down to your very core. Listen to some of the men coming back from Iraq and Afganistan and you will hear echoes of this message.<br /><br />Collins is a good writer who keeps the action coming. I compare this series to the Ender books, although I think OS Card is a better writer. I enjoyed the major plot twists. Collins created an interesting future world although the scale of the districts seams strangely small. Enjoyed the exploration of \\"Bread and Circus\\" along with fear to control a population. The characters in Katniss's prep team are memorable and provide needed humor while also displaying the differences between the district and capital lifstyles.<br /><br />Overall, very glad I read this series and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a more sci-fi type of work.
0374158460|5.0|I've never rated a book before but I had to speak to the excellence of Freedom by Jonathan Franzen.  I had read The Corrections earlier and was looking forward to his next book.  I pre-ordered it and it came relatively quickly.  I'm now halfway through it and have enjoyed every single word in the book.  Franzen is such a fluid, descriptive writer and I envy his way with words.  I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about the intricacies of the family structure.
B003PGNBNY|3.0|I watched this movie on the Disney channel and I dont think Id buy it on dvd simply because I thought it had way to many songs in it and not enough movie,it had like 13 songs or so in it and I bet if you took the songs out of the movie it would only be like a 1 hour movie or less. Bassicly I would have liked to see more movie and less songs but thats just me.
B001FVMIWQ|3.0|I also have the CD version of this album, my complaint lies not with the content. I'm not sure if the problem is the Sony Legacy label, or the actual company that pressed the record, but there is no reason why a record of this stature shouldn't come on 180 Grams of Vinyl (poor business decision-Sony).  Also, the record was dusty right out of the sleeve and the edges were poorly smoothed (poor quality control-record presser).  In all i found the record to be a flimsy experience that wasn't worth the premium. Maybe other Vinyl fans haven't found the same problems, but for me i was definitely disappointed in my purchase.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|I'm happy to say that Predators is the sequel we've been waiting 23 years to see. I watched Predator 2 on Blu-ray the other night and while I think it's underrated by many, even I can't call it a worthy follow-up to the 1987 classic. Predators has more than it's share of copycat moments. The familiar jungle setting, dialogue (\\"over here\\"), music, and even though it's missing that creepy vibe of the original, it's all kinds of fun to watch, especially if you're a fan of the series. Let's just forget those two Alien vs. Predator movies were ever made.<br /><br />Like the original, the team battling the Predators is small enough in size so you get to know them a little bit along the way, but they lack some of the simple charms. The acting may even be better this time around, but it's hard to beat two future governors and Apollo Creed fighting a 7 foot alien. Adrien Brody is one of the last people I would ever think of being an action hero, but he bulked up, put on his best Christian Bale era Batman voice, and pulled it off pretty darn well. Laurence Fishburne isn't in the film as much as the trailers would make you believe, but I liked the weirdness he brought to the role. There wasn't one cast member I hated, so that's always a plus, but I did feel the whole Topher Grace thing was too obvious. I also wish they got more use out of Danny \\"Machete\\" Trejo.<br /><br />We now learn that the Predators themselves are broken down into two classes. The smaller ones we've seen before and look almost identical to the original predator, but the larger ones have a slightly different looking face and one huge lower jaw. At first I was not that crazy about having these different races of Preds fighting each other, as well as, the humans, but the idea grew on me. The creatures themselves look good, but they come across more bulky than agile, especially during the hand to hand fight scenes. At times I thought I was watching the WWE galactic edition.<br /><br />The CGI is good 90% of the time (still not sure about those alien dogs) and unlike Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, you can actually see what's going on in the action sequences. The gore level is average. It would have been nice to see some more creative kills from various Predator weapons, instead of just the wrist blades and shoulder cannons.<br /><br />I still wish Robert Rodriguez would have not only produced, but directed, like he initially planned, but Nimr&oacute;d Antal gives us a film worthy enough to sit beside Predator on my DVD shelf. Now bring on the sequels or I'll really hate that open ending.e about those alien dogs) and unlike Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, you can actually see what's going on in the action sequences.

0380725398|3.0|I have to say, this book by Daphne du Maurier is a little underwhelming.<br /><br />The writing is, as expected, gorgeous. Just like in Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel, it is very atmospheric. There is, no doubt, an air of Emily and Charlotte Bronte's style about it. Considering that I am a huge fan of both Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, that's a big plus. Du Maurier is also very skillful at building suspense. A feeling of dread and foreboding is maintained throughout the novel making it an intense reading experience.<br /><br />But the writing is not the weakest point of Jamaica Inn. The story itself is. For me the mystery of Jamaica Inn and the crimes it hides is too simplistic. Nothing much happens in the story besides Mary Yellan trying to figure out what awful business her dreadful uncle is a part of and whose brain is behind the whole crime scheme. She figures it all out very quickly indeed. And we along with her. There are simply not enough characters in this book to not figure out who the biggest bad guy is. As for the perpetrator's motive, I don't think I quite got it.<br /><br />And romance. While there are some great conversations, the love story is a bit rushed and underdeveloped IMO. The heroine is smart and strong-willed, but her attraction to the hero is too quick and her decision at the end of the book is strange. Maybe this is what a genre of gothic romance is all about though? An atmospheric story with a romance of the complexity of an average Harlequin novel? I don't know, I am not very familiar with the genre.<br /><br />Anyway, in spite of my slight disappointment, I am still interested in exploring Daphne du Maurier's works in future, but I hope they are more akin to Rebecca rather than Jamaica Inn. Are they?

B000Y9PILI|5.0|I have this album in my collection from 1971 and played it with great frequency,  but my album collection found it's way into box's and hasn't seen the light of day  for many years.After reading about the re-release of this gem on an expanded CD/DVD,I decided to reaquainte myself with this gem.  To say the least,this album has been providing me with maximum joy again, as I play it repeatedly in my chiropractic practice.I love turning my younger patients onto   what I consider to be the finest music ever made.  This is a deeply personal Album for Graham, as he shares with you what he is feeling  as the relationship/life he built with his then partner Joni Mitchell evaporates.  In closing I must say that there isn't one bum track on this disc.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Season 8 was one of the best seasons of Smallville.  It was so dark and the characters were in a hard place. The brief reunion and closing of the Clark/Lana relationship was fantastic but this was Chloe's season. A love triangle with the nerd, the beauty and the beast...so well done. The extra features (commentary, deleted scenes) were ok but it could've used a bit more commentary for the important episodes. All in all a great buy for a Smallville fan.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|BBC does it again. North & South is a great movie! Acting is flawless, great plot, and it just has everything. It has the Pride and Prejudice theme a bit where the two main characters have misguided judgement about one another. You have to see it yourself and you will be glad you watched it.
B00026WU7I|5.0|The owner of a local CD store recently told me that the 15 - 25 year old demographic is re-discovering 1970s music in a big way. He says that 1970s artists like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd are outselling all contemporary bands among this age group.<br /><br />Interesting, if it's true. And judging by the number of teen and 20 somethings I see sporting T-shirts of 1970s bands, I'm inclined to think it has some validity.<br /><br />For anyone exploring 1970s music, or discovering (re-discovering?) Bob Dylan, this is an essential album.<br /><br />It's Dylan's best 1970s album as well as being one of the best albums of that decade. It's also one of the best albums of Dylan's lengthy, productive career.<br /><br />Bottom line: this CD should be in any collection of 1970s music.
0439023513|5.0|Before I begin my review, I would first like to say what an incredible and delightful series I thought Hunger Games was.  Mockingjay is no exception and I must say I am utterly shocked at the many bad reviews this book received.    ********SPOILERS AHEAD*********    The book starts out with Katniss Everdeen visiting her old home-one that is now just a bunch of rubble.  District 12 is completely destroyed.  All of the districts, but for 2, are now rebelling against the capital.  And Katniss Everdeen finds herself unwillingly being the symbol, the face of the entire rebellion.  She only found out days ago herself while also finding out that fellow tribute Peeta Mellark is being held prisoner in the capital.    Lucky for her, Gale Kaniss's best friend managed to get a small portion of District 12 out alive.  Her family and some friends are now leaving in the very real and alive District 13.  In District 13 things are rather different.  Everybody lives underground, has a schedule stamped on their arm everyday, and food is given in precise amounts.  Life seems simple enough, but District 13 isn't everything it seems.    The president of District 13-Coin-has her own ideas.  Katniss once again finds herself another game piece in Coins game.  While Katniss agrees to be the face of the rebellion, Coin weighs that if she steps one foot out of line she will kill all that Katniss loves.      Throughout the beginning of the book Katniss goes to different ares of Panem and is broad casted live.  She mainly goes around to show what the capital is doing to the country.      Meanwhile the rebels manage to rescue Peeta.  Katniss is overjoyed, until Peeta almost manages to kill her.  After Peeta managed to warn district 13 about an attack the capital tortured him.  By injecting him with small doses of tracker jacker venom they have brainwashed Peeta into hating Katniss.      Throughout the book characters start making bigger appearances and we can finally get a look at what's been going on besides Katniss's world.  We see a lot of Finnick, Johanna, Prim and especially Gale.  I've always been a Peeta fan, but this book made me realize what a great character Gale was.    Soon the entire country comes to a full war.  Katniss along with select others is sent to the capital.  Fabricating a mission when the time presents itself, Katniss claims she came to kill the president.  And that is exactly what she plans to do.    She comes so close, but in a way she still loses.  In the middle of the capital her younger sister is killed.  And Katniss watches it all.    The end is rather surprising and disappointing to most, but I liked it.  It was true Katniss spirit to the end.    As for the love triangle, the conclusion is Peeta and for good reason.      This book is positively amazing and one that you forget easily.
B00026WU4G|5.0|This is one of Dylan's best. It's certainly the best of his 1980s albums. Anyone who is discovering, or re-discovering, Dylan's work should have this album.<br /><br />Dylan is backed by some top flight musicians on this CD. Guitar work, for example, is divided between Mark Knopfler (formerly of Dire Straights) and Mick Taylor (formerly of the Rolling Stones). Knopfler's playing is instantly recognizable on tracks like Jokerman and Sweetheart Like You. Anyone familiar with Taylor's work with the Rolling Stones will recognize his tone and style on tracks like Neighborhood Bully and Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight.<br /><br />Dylan also tackles some interesting topics on the CD. Union Sundown is about globalization and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the USA; Neighborhood Bully is, by far, the best pro-Israel song I've ever heard.<br /><br />If your music collection only has room for a few Dylan albums, this CD should be one of them. It's an essential CD for any collection of Dylan's work.<br /><br />One comment for the people who reissue these albums: there was a song called Blind Willie McTell recorded during the original sessions for Infidels. It was not included on the original album release despite Mark Knopfler's heated arguments in favour of including it on the album. It's not included on this reissue either, although it was included on Dylan's Bootleg series. If you do another reissue of Infidels, put Blind Willie McTell on the album.
B003NWRM4O|3.0|This was a long finish to an interesting story.  The details were a bit lengthy. The story from the beginning was fast paced and exciting.  The facts about the government were very tedious.  The ending left me wanting, but I did enjoy it.

B003EV6DBM|1.0|Not including the specials means I will not be buying. Previous seasons have included all the specials aired between seasons. Since this one doesn't I'll spend my money on buying the specials and skip the season.<br /><br />My opinion of the writing, directing, acting, and actors of series 5 is just as bad. A Doctor Who who speaks in unintelligible rapid fire, fragmented, dis-jointed dialog that sounds like an unmediated ADHD kid does not rate more than one star, to me. The writing has deteriorated. We've gone from subtle clues to can't miss things that in the end all get washed away with a 'it never happened.' The previous seasons were a subtle mix able to be watched by both adults and children. Season 5 does not captivate me as an adult and it it makes me fear the children are being influenced to mimic that type of dialog.<br /><br />To me the total package of writing, directing, acting and actors have deteriorated and the fact that what is included in the season set has also been diminished means I won't be buying it!
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|I don't get out to the theater much, so when my 9 and 11 year olds suggested we go to the movies on a hot and rainy Sunday, I thought it would be a nice way to spend the day with the kids. \\"So what'll it be boys? [[ASIN:B00275EHJQ Toy Story 3]]? [[ASIN:B002ZG97EC Despicable Me]]?\\" Their reply in unison: \\"PREDATORS!!!\\" Actually I wasn't at all surprised since lately they've been spending most of their video game time online with [[ASIN:B001TOMQSK Aliens vs Predator]]. Truthfully I couldn't have been happier with their choice because that's really what I wanted to see most too.<br /><br />In the end no one was disappointed. Predators is a great action movie that not only pays homage to [[ASIN:B003L16FAE the original]], but brings the Predator franchise back to the brutal violence and fast moving story telling that made the first one a classic. Kudos to Director Nimr&oacute;d Antal and Producer Robert Rodriguez for not making any of the plethora of mistakes that were made with the sub-par [[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2]] or any of the [[ASIN:B00147F8ZA AvP]] movies.<br /><br />All the action looked real. All of the Predators (and other monsters) looked real. All of the acting is really good. Although I must say that I had a hard time swallowing Adrian Brody as the lead tough guy. Brody comes across as more of a softy to me. If I had to seek out a complaint it might be that Brody was a bit miscast, but not so much so that it took away from the thoroughly entertaining experience that I had with Predators.<br /><br />The story is very similar to the first one. A group of mostly soldiers (or soldier types) are in a mysterious jungle and soon realize that there's a role reversal going on: they are no longer hunters, mercenaries or whatever; they are the hunted. And they are going to need a lot of firepower and strategy in order to walk away alive from the situation that they are in.<br /><br />I guess if I had to \\"unEarth\\" another negative it would be that the storyline is quite familiar. But Antal and Rodriguez introduce enough new concepts and twists to keep this sequel pretty fresh looking and not as predictable as you may think. If you were a big fan of the 1987 cult classic like I was, I believe that you'll find that this 2010 reintroduction to the Predators will be a welcome one...like it was for me.<br /><br />A few words of caution to anyone that saw my comment about bringing the kids to this movie: it is not a family film. It earns its R rating. I'm just a little more liberal when it comes to what I think will warp the little minds of today's youth. So use your discretion.introduce enough new concepts and twists to keep this sequel pretty fresh looking and not as predictable as you may think.

1401307450|4.0|RHCP fans will enjoy this one, especially the detailed look into the early years of AK, Flea, and the formation of the band.  I would give the 1st half of the book 5 stars, but I took a star off because the 2nd half becomes very repetitive (band rehearsal, drug binge, breakup with a girl, go to rehab, and repeat, for about 6 straight chapters).    As I was reading the book I kept thinking \\"How is this guy still alive, and how does this band still exist?\\"  With his friends and fellow musicians dying all around him from overdoses, AK somehow made it through, and the world has some phenomenal music because of it.

B0015HOFZI|3.0|The instructions are misleading to say the least.  Based on the instructions, one should be able to adjust the recording volume and monitor the sound recording while in the process.  I contacted Sony tech support and was finally informed that neither situation was possible when using the USB connection.  The problem with this for me is I had to complete the entire process and have the recording loaded on the computer before being able to find out that something messed up and I had to start over.  I have also had problems with recording albums where the sound chops off the end of a song as it transitions to the next track of the album.<br />On the positive side, when you do get a recording done the quality is very good considering the condition of some of the records I have processed.  I think the product is overall acceptable, but it needs to improve on the operators monitoring and control of recording during the process.

I was one of those people that swore I would NEVER get caught up with this whole \\"Vampire Infatuation\\" going on, but my expectations for the show could not have been more wrong. This show is obviously about vampires, but it has such well developed story lines as well! This show is definitely for more mature teenagers and adults. There is a lot of action and twists in the series, but it makes the show that much more interesting! This dvd collection is something that all viewers should own! Hey and if you have never seen the show go out on a limb and watch it, you won't regret it! (:

B001R4MEYI|5.0|With Crack the Skye, Mastodon takes the progressive/melodic aspect of their music as far as they can take it (I think).  Only one song has unmelodic vocals, and it's from a guest singer.  There are two songs that are over 10 minutes long.  But the music still has an edge to it that is distinctly Mastodon, and the band's writing and performance skills are just as strong as ever.  The long songs don't overstay their welcome, thanks to Mastodon's compositional brilliance.    I'm happy to say that the sound quality of Mastodon's latest is a significant step up from Blood Mountain.  There's no clipping or overcompression here, unlike on the previous album.     At this point, Mastodon have secured their place as the best metal band of the '00s, with four classic albums on par with Metallica's first four.  Where they will go from here, I have no idea.  Seeing the uncanny resemblance of progressiveness with each album to that of Metallica's, it's very possible that the next album could be the sell-out album.  Even if this is the case, I won't mind, because these guys deserve to make a lot of money.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|There isn't a single track I don't like.  MGMT's sound is hard to describe, but it's roughly a mixture of psychedelic-pop, and prog-rock.  There's probably some alternative/college/indie rock in there too.  This band knows how to make soundscapes.  Catchy soundscapes, at that.     There are three songs on this album that are more pop/electronic oriented than the other songs, and it's to the band's credit that these songs are not any weaker than the more progressive songs on the album.  Lyrically, the song \\"Time to Pretend\\" is fantastic: it starts off as a young person's fantasy of the idealized rockstar lifestyle and all its excesses, but as the song progresses, the person reflects on the childhood he would have to leave behind in order to pursue his dream.  The innocence of childhood contrasts perfectly with the shameless hedonism of the rockstar life.    As others have mentioned, the sound quality of Oracular Spectacular is pretty bad; there is over-compression galore.  This was MGMT's intention, for better or for worse.

B000003TSP|5.0|This album will transport you to an urban landscape in England where classic jazz meets hip hop and rock. Where a feathery blues singer warbles incoherently but soulfully as a black and white television blasts out of it's tinny speaker some kind of mystic soundscape.    There is nothing like it done this well. Portishead is timeless because it doesn't fit any time. It is the sounds of a dream that has been heard for over sixty years and will not die.
1400031001|5.0|Bravo.  Any Human Heart tells the life story in diary form of novelist and literary critic Logan Mountstuart (1906-1991), a likable and roguish hero.  We live through his marriages, dalliances, literary success and frustrations, good decisions and bad, and his successes and failures.  He is afforded good luck and bad (as he might put it).  He meets an entertaining array of prominent 20th Century figures including Hemingway, Picasso, Evelyn Waugh, Frank O'Hara, Jackson Pollock, Virginia Wolff, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, James Joyce and others, which is tremendous fun (all of these figures are convincingly portrayed and none suffer through gratuitous cameos).<br /><br />Mountstuart's life comes to include many genres -- spy, adventure, romance, marital drama, historical drama -- and what you get in the end is the mix of half-successes, failures, fantasies, longings, intrigues and relationships good and bad that comprise lives, and that in this case come together as quite a moving story.  It was pleasant and enlightening to share 70 years with Mountstuart; when it's over, one misses his company.  Mountstuart is not a romantic figure with grand, world-changing goals, but he has his set of standards and tries to uphold them over time.  The credo he adopts in the Spanish civil War has two hates and three loves: hatred of injustice, hatred of privilege, love of life, love of humanity, love of beauty.  He describes the spirit of the Cosmopolitans, a French school of pre-WWI poets about whom Mountstuart writes his third book, thusly: \\"They are all about romance, about life's excitement and adventure and its essential sadness and transience. They savour everything both fine and bittersweet that life has to offer - stoical in their hedonism.\\"  It is the spirit in which Mountstuart lives his life.<br /><br />Boyd's literary style is elegant but not flashy, just right for the diary form.  The evolving voice of the character at different ages is totally convincing, as is Boyd's evocation of a diverse set of places and times.  As Mountstuart says, \\"You cannot live on caviar and foie gras every day: sometimes a plain dish of lentils is all the palate craves, even if one insists that the lentils come from Puy.\\" Well said.<br /><br />I loved it, read it quickly and now feel lucky to have found a great new (to me) author.ation of a diverse set of places and times.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|[In the low raspy voice of Don LaFontaine, King of the Movie Trailer Voice-Overs]: In a world where good women are taken for granted by bad men, two women decide to switch houses in order to get out of town for the holidays. One in England, one in Los Angeles, they soon find that they have switched more than houses, they've switched lives that don't make sense for ones that do, albeit in an extremely complicated fashion.<br /><br />Iris (Kate Winslet), who works for a London newspaper has just learned that Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell), a bounder and a cad that she is foolishly in love with, is engaged to be married--but not to her. Her job as a writer is to cover the engagement before the other papers scoop them. I don't think so. She goes online and offers her home to swap for someone somewhere else so she can leave this tangled mess and fall out of love with Jasper.<br /><br />Meanwhile Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) has just booted her philandering boy friend out and is also looking to make herself scarce. She has a very successful company that makes movie trailers, is a bit of a workaholic, and rarely vacations. She takes up Iris on her offer, and sets out for jolly old England. One of Amanda's issues is that no matter how messy the break up, she won't cry. Another is that from working so much on movie trailers, she tends to see her own life in those terms and imagines movie trailers that comment on the events in her life.<br /><br />This provides a thread of continuity that runs throughout this film, with two other characters from the world of Hollywood that will soon become a part of Iris' life. First there is Amanda's elderly neighbor Arthur Abbot (Eli Wallach), an old school screenwriter. Next she meets Miles (Jack Black), a film soundtrack composer with a healthy respect for great film composers of the past. When they meet Iris, they 'meet cute,' though Iris doesn't know it at the time. Arthur will later explain exactly what a 'meet cute' is, and also that she is a leading lady but she's acting like the best friend. More on that later, but here is Arthur's definition of the 'meet cute.'<br /><br />---------------<br />Arthur Abbott: Say a man and a woman both need something to sleep in and both go to the same men's pajama department. The man says to the salesman, \\"I just need bottoms,\\" and the woman says, \\"I just need a top.\\" They look at each other and that's the 'meet cute.'<br />===========<br /><br />This is how Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper met in 1938's Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Since Arthur is 90, uses a walker, and Iris finds him wandering about unable to remember where he lives, their 'meet cute' is somewhat circumscribed. But perhaps he just needs her to jog his memory, and soon Arthur is remembering all kinds of interesting stories from his days as a screenwriter in Hollywood's Golden Age. He also offers Iris lots of insight and wisdom, and their relationship provides the emotional highpoint of the film.<br /><br />------------------<br />Iris: I like corny. I'm looking for corny in my life.<br />==============<br /><br />Jude Law and Cameron Diaz would appear to be the leading man and leading lady, respectively. Jude Law plays Iris' brother Graham, a man with a complicated life involving multiple women:<br /><br />------------------<br />Sophie: Daddy, she has more marshmallows than I do.<br />Graham: No she doesn't, you each have five.<br />[to Amanda]<br />Graham: You have five too.<br />Amanda: Thanks<br />==========<br /><br />Law and Diaz do fine as the ostensible first couple in this Rom Com, but Kate Winslet, as Arthur tells her, is the real leading lady. Her growing flirtation with Miles also provides a very amusing scene in a video store where Jack Black gives Kate quite a course in movie soundtrack music appreciation. In fact, every scene with Jack Black and Winslet plays out like one long 'meet cute.' There is also a scene between her and Rufus Sewell, an intense actor who played Alexander Hamilton in the award winning miniseries John Adams, about the second President of the United States. Rumor has it that in real life Winslet and Sewell were an item, and one can't help but wonder if some of the scenes between Iris and Jasper were fueled by unresolved anger.

Jack Black, though part of the 'comic relief couple' stole the show with his amusing antics, and Kate Winslet was the true leading lady.     ------------------  Miles: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kiss you twice and then linger on the second one.   ================    [[ASIN:B0002RGNRU Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]] (2004) Kate Winslet was Clementine Kruczynski  [[ASIN:B00018U9G6 School of Rock (Widescreen Edition)]] (2003) Jack Black was Dewey Finn  [[ASIN:B000060K5W Artificial Intelligence: AI]] (2001) Jude Law was Gigolo Joe   [[ASIN:B00005JKMZ Vanilla Sky]] (2001) Cameron Diaz was Julie Gianni   [[ASIN:B00003CXGA High Fidelity]] (2000) Jack Black was Barry  [[ASIN:B00003CXPV Quills]] (2000) Kate Winslet was Madeleine 'Maddy' LeClerc   [[ASIN:6305807086 Being John Malkovich]] (1999) Cameron Diaz was Lotte Schwartz   [[ASIN:0792165020 The Talented Mr. Ripley]] (1999) Jude Law was Dickie Greenleaf   [[ASIN:6305078319 Dangerous Beauty]] (1998) Rufus Sewell was Marco Venier   [[ASIN:6304698798 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] (1966) Eli Wallach was Tuco     ------------------  Miles: Well, hello big dollop!   ==========
B0013FNC38|5.0|I already had the CD and sent this as a gift. The person I sent it to -loved it. His music is uplifting and a combination of folk and Jazz.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I am IN LOVE with Sheldon. OMG, he is so hilarious.  I came into this show in the middle of season 2 and it was because of Sheldon that I bought Season 1 and Season 2 -to catch up with what I missed. Now I just want to own it, because everything on tv is so stupid now, it is worth buying the good stuff so that one has proof that someone had a good idea at least once or twice during this age of bad tv and ridiculous reality shows.     Season 3 brings us back with the gang in Pasadena California.  3 Phd's, one MA and Penny.  There is so much going on in this show, the things they say are so funny.  But the friendship is really great, they have their clique and they are cool in their own way.  Honestly, the show would not survive without Walowitz and Sheldon.  I just love how those two characters are just complete polar opposites, Walowitz being a total girl crazy horndog, and Sheldon being totally sexually ambivilent and sexually ambiguous. His OCD is hilarious.  I also love the mothers, Laurie Metcaf as Sheldon's mom and (I cant recall her name) as Leonard's mom.  Great actresses, playing these roles fantastically.    I really like seeing cast members from the show Roseanne popping up, Sarah Gilbert and Laurie Metcaf. Of Course Leonard played \\"David (aka) Kevin\\" in Roseanne as well.      Great show, worth the 1/2 hour viewing time.
B001TW69J4|5.0|Now let's start this off by saying that I first heard this whole album yesterday.  In that time I have listened to it a minimum of 12 times through, front to back.  An album usually takes me quite some time to really get into, especially something as complex and varied as this.  For some reason this sound works so well I am instantly madly in love with it.  The seamless blend of styles, tempo shifts and timing is something that cannot be overlooked, there is a reason this album has all five star reviews.    I am pretty sick of bands like Dream Theater masquerading around as one of the genre's top bands, their sound is dated and pretentious to the max.  THIS is the sound of the future, THIS is the sound all modern prog-metal bands are looking for.  Go buy this album.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This is my favorite season so far. They continue to stay true to the theme of the show and it still has the same feel as it did in Season 1 but they have been able to allow for good growth and development of the characters. Dexter is now a family man, married with 3 kids. He struggles with holding onto the illusion of being \\"normal\\" while still engaging in his outside activities. He does discover something interesting though...he actually has an attachment to Rita and the kids and has actual guilt when he kills an innocent man that he thought was a serial killer.<br /><br />John Lithgow does a great job playing the bad guy (he always was good at playing lunatics). I enjoyed this season a lot and I hope they continue to keep it going strong in Season 5.
1439181780|2.0|Before I begin, let me say that I love Rhonda Byrne, and I absolutely loved The Secret. When I heard Rhonda Byrne was coming out with a 2nd book, I immediately had to pre-order it, a good 6 weeks in advance.  I was pumped.  Well, after reading it, not so pumped anymore.  It's not a terrible book, but I was hoping for something with a few more nuts & bolts than this.  It's a simplistic, spirit boosting book, rather than building upon The Secret.<br /><br />I decided I'll do a pro & con review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very enthusiastic<br />-Lots of exclamation points! (Which, you will see, I called a Pro & Con)<br />-Definitely very, very positive<br />-Inspirational and uplifting<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Lots of exclamation points!  Seriously, 1 out of every 3 sentences in this book ends in an exclamation point.  It was fun the first chapter, but it got old FAST.<br />-If you think The Secret was filled with \\"fluff\\", this book is worse.....<br />-The entire theme is love.  She just goes on and on and on and on and on (get the point?) about how Love is life, Love is everything, Love is the power, all positivity comes from Love.  It's a bit much for a 200+ page book, if you ask me.  This book could have been condensed down to maybe 50 pages.<br /><br />The book is definitely uplifting and inspirational, so I suppose if you're down on your luck and need a boost in spirts, it might be a worthwhile read.  If you're looking for step by step answers on how to succeed beyond your wildest dreams, look elsewhere.  That's not the goal of this book.  This book is meant to get your head screwed on straight, and get you \\"feeling\\" the correct way, to help set the law of attraction wheels in motion.
0439023513|1.0|I would like to start off by stating The Hunger Games was an awesome book. With that being said, I would like to state that Catching Fire was one of the BEST books I have ever read. So what does that leave me thinking? That with the arrival of Mockingjay, and the pattern I have picked up on means that I will get to read one of the best books ever written...this was definitely not the case.     I am disappointed because Mockingjay does not provide a substantial ending to the climax built by its successors. Why, you ask. Because of the following reasons (there are no spoilers):    1.) Katniss is not Katniss in the third book. She is not the tough tribute, who underneath all her rage really has a big heart. She is not the \\"fighting for the right reasons\\" girl we came to know and love.    2.) Mockingjay is an entirely different book than the previous two. Mockingjay is a book about war. Pure, unemotional accounts of war. If you're into that, it will be a great read.    3.) The ending was awful. Sure, no one was expecting the ending to be completely happy. But after all the author puts you through, the ending makes you feel as if the rebellion wasn't worth the trouble. Bring back the capitol, the separated districts- even the hunger games for crying out loud! Because I felt that everyone was much happier then.    To be honest I read the previous two books in less than a week each. This one took me much longer. That says enough on its own, for me.    So I repeat Ms. Collins, we promise to forgive you, but please write us a new ending to your trilogy!!!

B003L77TZI|4.0|Teenage Dream was an album that I have been eagerly waiting for since I first heard California Gurls.Most songs are average pop songs but a few aare def gems. Teenage Dream is a song that makes you feel like ur in the 80s absolutely love it. Firework is one of my favs as well. BUT Circle the Drain is one of the best songs not only on this album but even combined with One of the Boys. This songs lyrics are very honest and yes I agree that the f word was kinda forced sounding but love this tune! Only downfall on this album is the repeatitiveness of Peacock, its not a bad song BUT it gets on my nerves by the tyme the 2nd corus comes rolling around! After all is said n done this album def made its mark and hopefully will stick around for another 2 or 3 more singles!!!
0439023513|1.0|First off, let me say that my review will contain SPOILERS.  Next, let me say that I really enjoyed the first two books of this serious.  And then, let me say that this book is one of the worst books I have read in a long time.  I feel as if the author of this book and no idea how to finish her trilogy so she decided to write a philosophical young adult book about the tragedy of war instead of focusing on what really matters...the story and the characters within the story!!!  Maybe if she would have written the book well it may have worked, but this book was written so bad that I ended up having to skim through several pages because of how bored I was.    Let me make a list of things that were written terribly.  Again let me warn that there are spoilers:    1.  Katniss, who was once a strong feminine character that I respected, turned into a heartless and boring person who had no direction in this book.  She only had one brief action scene (way to go on shooting the bomber there Katniss, a real doozy!), and the way she supports Peeta throughout the book is reminiscent of how I would treat Hitler if I were to live in his day.  Also, how many times in this book was Katniss knocked out and then awoke in a hospital bed or in a similar setting?  At least four times!  Wow!  weak sauce!  I have so much to say on how much I hated Katniss in this book that I will just move on.    2.  Peeta's story also sucked in this book.  I understand torture sucks, but what made Peeta cool was HIS character.  Peeta may as well have died and have come back as some minor character who hates Katniss for some reason.  His rescue from his torturers was not even described in the book.  It was like the author was like \\"hmmm, how will I get Peeta back?  I know, Ill just have some people say they will rescue him and then they will within one chapter!\\".  That was so anticlimactic and lame.    3.  The love triange.  It was lame.  It was a side story.  May has well have not been there.  It was contained within the last ten pages.  Gale is out of the picture and Katniss and Peeta live a depressing life in misery.  Yay.    4.  The death of other characters in the book was completely predictable and stupid.  \\"Here are some random characters everyone for me to kill off...oh and I guess I could kill off Finnick in a really stupid way.\\"  Honestly, how stupid does Suzanne think we all are?    5.  How random of an enemy was Coin?  Katniss kills her before she kills Snow?  For two straight books the main bad honcho was Snow and he was completely replaced by Coin who turns out to be even more heartless by killing tons of little children and wanting to start the games back up.  Oh, and why did Katniss agree to that?  Some people say it was her only way to get close to Coin but that is just lame.  The book should be more clear about Katniss's motives instead of leaving the interpretation to the reader.    I have many other reasons to hate this book but my fingers are getting tired now.  Straight up, this book sucks.  Not sure why many have giving this book good reviews.. I guess they are seeing something I don't.  I would have preferred to have read another person's interpretation of what happened then read this filth.  I think I will just write a short summary of what I believe should have happened at the end of book two and then I will hold that as cannon as to what really happened instead of ever picking this book up again.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This set is fun to build and play with because all important scenes of Star Wars are in it!  And there are lots of minifigures to play with.  The Darth Vader TIE fighter is also very cool! The twin canons and elevators inside are very interesting to play as well.  Cheaper at lego website.
B00171AEKW|1.0|The book quality is .... i just can't say it is just the worse , the quality of the paper is just like a very cheap peper.<br />i dont have any further comment
0743487486|4.0|So many times while listening to parents I think of the wit and wisdom of Alfie Kohn.  It hits the spot.  Since I find myself recommending this book more and more often, let me share some of what it has given me.     An important point I took home from Unconditional Parenting, apart from the sheer joy of the title, is:  in the event of misbehavior, respond to your child, not to bystanders. When I have shared this advice with others, their wide-eyed sighs of gratitude show that people crave permission to do this and many other things Kohn advises to support autonomy.  Another key is: \\"avoid rushing.\\"   These techniques really do work.  As parents, we don't need to demean ourselves or our children by resorting to bribes, law-enforcement via time-outs, counting, and other ways to maintain the upper hand.  We really can explain and be answerable and flexible, thus modeling responsible behaviour.    Kohn has my thanks for his clear message on praise. When my daughter was just 20 months old I held back (with great difficulty, I might add) from \\"praising\\" a drawing she had made, remaining silent long enough to hear her observe, \\"mountains.\\" From that day I was sold.    To be honest, when I read _Unconditional Parenting_ five years ago, I called it a \\"dumbed down version of the Continuum Concept\\" -- not to dismiss \\"for dummies\\" books.  Having lived among indigenous communities in India, I could relate to some of the observations Liedloff made about family relationships among the Yecuana, and bristled at what I read as his attempts to translate these into lessons fitting a suburban middle-class consumer lifestyle.    Still, in a world where we are surrounded by people ready to accuse parents of being permissive, not-disciplining when we are actually cultivating inner discipline, it is reassuring to have an articulate expert like Kohn to remind us that there is evidence to support our approach.    Of course I get evidence of this every day. People might call me biased :-). But if I did not see my child growing more capable of making responsible choices, expressing compassion, and learning from mistakes, from where would I get the patience to keep up? It takes a lot of time to listen, answer, explain, give her a role in decision making, explain some more, try to see things from her perspective. It also takes considerable faith to recognize that there is something to learn from a tantrum - both for the child and parent.  Much of what we learn goes towards preventing the conditions that lead to the tantrum, since often they are in our control.  But no matter what we do, there are times when life does not make sense. A tantrum is one honest response to this -- till we can build inner reserves of confidence in ourselves against the abyss - the absurdity of life, the unquenchable why, what if ... We would do well to acknowledge and respect this process rather than silence or apologize for it.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Now, I'm typically not one to write a review on a product, much less a cd. often times I would look to other people's reviews, and once I receive a product that either agrees or disagrees with everyone else's outlook, I would just move on to other things. There hasn't been a product since now that has compelled me to write a review on a product that warrants much praise.    The Element of Freedom has an exceptional blend of R&B while still being classy. Many R&B music and other urban types of music styles appear to focus on mainly intimacy and \\"making love in the club\\"(yes, I'm talking to you Usher), which can put off people like me who like the beat, rhythm, and soul of R&B but are put off by the blatantly obscene nature of the lyrics.     With inspirational songs such as \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" and \\"Wait Til You See My Smile,\\" which explores finally getting over a relationship and being truly happy, and \\"Un-thinkable\\" which shows the courage and risk it takes to pursue and accept love, Alicia Keys shows that she's not an artist looking to cash in on what's trendy with pop culture, but rather seeks to explore the deeper intricacies of love and inspire others through her music.
B00004U45G|4.0|I was surprised at how great this show was. Definitely worth the money for both Zeppelin and Crowes fans.
0486437507|4.0|Any collection of Robert W Chambers's \\"King in Yellow\\" stories is a rare and welcome gift, and the best of those stories--\\"The Yellow Sign,\\" \\"The Repairer of Reputations,\\" and \\"In the Court of the Dragon\\"--are included in this volume. Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle. The missing stories, in this reviewer's opinion, are as follows: \\"The Prophet's Paradise,\\" \\"The Street of the Four Winds,\\" \\"The Street of the First Shell,\\" \\"The Street of Our Lady of the Fields,\\" and \\"Rue Barree.\\" Had the current volume included these tales, I would have given it the highest possible marks. Still, it is an excellent collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the work of the inestimable and terribly underrated Robert W. Chambers.
0439023483|5.0|Wow, this book turned out to be much better than I had hoped for.  I actually couldn't put it down and found myself taking it with me wherever I went in hopes of getting in a few extra minutes of reading.      The book is the first in a powerful trilogy.  The basic synopsis is that American as we know it is long gone and a new country stands in its place.  The country is divided into districts that each have their own separate jobs to do.  The all-powerful capitol makes life in the districts miserable.  But the capitol's power is questioned when a girl named Katniss challenges their authority in their own death games: The Hunger Games.  A possible revolt is on the distant horizon, but I won't say anymore so I don't ruin the book.     Overall, the characters are well developed and believable.  Also, the book's outcome is unique and unpredictable.  The book is action packed and suspenseful and hard to put down.  A great opener for an amazing trilogy.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise: The Complete First Season    (Released: 2005 by Paramount Home Entertainment)    Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia     In the beginning, Zefram Cochrine invented Warp Drive technology.  The rest was (TV, movie, and merchandising) history!    Somehow, I'd never seen STAR TREK ENTERPRISE before.  That is until an Amazon.com DVD sale proved irresistible, and I finally took the plunge.      I didn't know what to expect.  What I did know is that, while I loved both STAR TREK THE ORIGINAL SERIES (\\"TOS\\") and STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION (\\"TNG\\"- Great shows for different reasons!), each succeeding TREK series left me less and less satisfied.      I liked DEEP SPACE NINE (\\"DS9\\") less than TNG, and VOYAGER (\\"VOY\\") less than DS9.  As VOYAGER was winding down, ENTERPRISE (\\"ENT\\") was starting up.  Life's ups and downs notwithstanding, I was also not too eager to sample yet another TREK show that would presumably continue the downward trend.      Elaborating on why I felt this way toward DS9 and VOY, I can only say that each moved further away from the \\"core\\" of what I thought STAR TREK should be.      Both series were not about a ship (Extra points if the ship is named \\"Enterprise\\"!) in active service to the Federation.  Yes, Voyager was a ship too, but it was (um...) \\"lost in space\\", full of weird characters, and wasn't nearly as much fun as was the Jupiter II.      There were also too many strange aliens on these shows.  In contrast, TOS and TNG were far more relatable to us humans.  Vulcans, Klingons, and the occasional Betazoid are okay, but I really started drawing the line at regularly featured Ferengi (DS9 - I HATE Ferengi!) and the very annoying Neelix (VOY).      ENTERPRISE goes back to the beginning and, much as J.J. Abrams has done in his recent feature film, starts to tell the story from the ground (Earth's \\"ground\\") on up.     Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer, is the perfect middle-ground between \\"womanizer/ cowboy\\" James T. Kirk and \\"stiff-upper-lipped\\" Jean Luc Picard.      The crew he leads is predominantly human (Engineer Trip Tucker, Armory Officer Malcolm Reed, Navigator Travis Mayweather, and Translator Hoshi Sato), with just the right number of aliens... Vulcan Science Officer Sub-Commander T'Pol and genial Doctor Phlox (a Denobulan who is part of the \\"Inter-Species-Medical-Exchange\\").      As this series took place a century before the original STAR TREK, efforts were made to look... not merely retro, but \\"pre-retro\\", if you will.  This Enterprise is small, almost cramped, compared with later models.  Try as they might, the set design crew couldn't always make this 2001 show look 100 years more primitive than its 1966 predecessor.     The clothing had to step back as well.  Starfleet Admirals wore basic (but somewhat futuristically designed) military dress uniforms - and Archer and his crew wore garb that was a cross between NASA gear and the crew jumpsuits from VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.      Oh, and Archer has a DOG!  A beagle named \\"Porthos\\".  A first for a TREK series!        As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.         The CONS:    Packaging: Why is it that ALL STAR TREK SERIES have packaging that is both annoying and difficult to open and negotiate?!  The discs of STAR TREK ENTERPRISE are housed in a large \\"clamshell\\" pack that opens like an oversized stick of deodorant!      Attached to the package with TWO DABS OF GLUE is a cardboard piece that wraps AROUND THE TOP FRONT, BACK, AND BOTTOM FRONT of the package!  You cannot open the package without removing the cardboard.  BUT, on this cardboard, is the ONLY PLACE that it is identified as being the FIRST SEASON!  So, if you remove it, nothing else on the package can distinguish it from subsequent seasons.  WHY?      Menu Navigation: STAR TREK SERIES often have the most difficult, and outright noisy Menus to navigate.  Though, I must admit that the menus of ENTERPRISE are much easier tonavigate than that of the Original Series. Still, it is a CON.    No Skipping the End Credits:  To my surprise, I found that the EPISODE END CREDITS - the SAME end credits that Paramount routinely shrunk, squashed, and did not allow to be read in its original UPN TV broadcasts - COULD NOT BE CHAPTER-SKIPPED on it's DVDs.  Of course, I can choose to fast forward through them, if need be.  BUT... Just thought I'd share the irony, folks!       The PROS:    Wide Screen:  STAR TREK ENTERPRISE is the first TREK series to be filmed in wide-screen.  When played on my HD TV and upconverted via Blu-ray player, it's a delight to behold!      The Episodes - with a special emphasis on the pilot:    \\"Broken Bow\\":  No Star Dates here!  This takes place in the almost-relatable year 2151!  It has been 90-100 years since Cochrine's introduction of Warp Drive and travel to the distant stars is now a more a reality than a possibility.      The planet Vulcan has taken notice of these early experiments, and has sent emissaries to Earth... to \\"guide us\\" along the correct path.  This is a SUPERB inversion of all those TOS and TNG episodes where the Federation declines or refuses to share its superior technologies with developing planetary cultures, due to the \\"Prime Directive\\".      Resentment toward our Vulcan \\"friends\\" has grown, as they are suspect of holding back on technological developments and suppressing the development of Earth's Warp Program efforts.     Jonathan Archer, the son of Henry Archer - an associate of Cochrine's - is selected to be captain of the just completed \\"Enterprise NX-01\\", a forerunner of the more familiar later USS Enterprise NCC-1701.  The Enterprise NX-01 can reach the as-of-yet unheard of speed of Warp Factor 5!  Later ships could travel at Warp 9 and above.      Without spoiling too much for those who STILL haven't seen it, we have such grand moments as:    The great speech about \\"boldly going, etc.\\" that all starship captains seem to spout was actually from an historic speech by Zefram Cochrine.  The speech is played on the occasion of the launch of the Enterprise NX-01.     The first human to go through a transporter. Under duress, I might add.  It was originally, not thought of for human use.  Shuttle-Pods are routinely used for transport.      The introduction of the \\"phase-pistol\\" (with two settings \\"Stun\\" and \\"Kill\\" - nothing in between).      No Deflector Shields yet.  Instead, they \\"polarize the hull plating\\".      No phaser-weaponry that can be fired by the ship.  There are \\"photon torpedoes\\", but they are exactly that - torpedoes that are physically loaded as on a submarine!  \\"Phase Cannons\\" (the forerunner of ship phaser-weaponry) are developed during Season One.     Communicators are of the good old \\"flip variety\\".     The initial mission involves a Klingon that was pursued to Earth by hostiles unknown, and the sensitive diplomatic mission to return him to the Klingon homeworld.  Klingons were an unknown species at the time - the one was even referred to as a \\"Kling-got\\" by the admiral in charge.      We also meet the series' new major villains: The Suliban.  This race is conducting a campaign of aggression against the Klingons and other species, taking its marching orders from a mysterious presence from \\"The Future\\".  This campaign, referred to as the \\"Temporal Cold War\\" slowly unfolds over the course of the season - and beyond.      Some pilot, eh?  Now, a few other highlights...     \\"The Andorian Incident\\": Archer and crew stumble onto the ongoing hostilities between the Vulcans and the blue-skinned, antenna-ed Andorians, with unexpected revelations.  Perhaps my favorite episode of this season.      \\"Cold Front\\" Archer is surprised to find his steward hails from 900 years in the future, and is a player in the \\"Temporal Cold War\\".     \\"Dear Doctor\\":  A grim choice on the part of Archer and Doctor Phlox results in the first contemplations of \\"The Prime Directive\\" of non-interference with alien cultures.\\"Sleeping Dogs\\" Archer and company assist the crew of a doomed Klingon ship.  They don't want the assistance.      \\"Shuttlepod One\\":  Trip and Malcolm's ordeal marooned aboard a lost shuttlepod.     \\"Acquisition\\": A boarding party of Ferengi incapacitates the crew of NX-01, and begins to loot the ship. ENTERPRISE does the impossible. A Ferengi story that I actually like!    \\"Detained\\": A militaristic society imprisons Archer and Travis in a detention camp filled with Suliban victims.      \\"Vox Sola\\": A web-like creature invades the Enterprise, takes over a cargo hold, and wraps its captured victims as would a spider!  The images of Archer and his fellow captives webbed-up are effectively disgusting.  A visual masterpiece!      \\"Desert Crossing\\": More striking scenic visuals, as a seemingly friendly desert warlord takes Archer and Trip hostage to obtain knowledge of his enemies.  Clancy Brown (\\"Superman the Animated Series\\", \\"Lost\\") is a standout as the warlord.     \\"Shockwave\\": Ah, what would a modern STAR TREK series be without a season-ending cliffhanger episode!  This one reveals tantalizingly more about the \\"Temporal Cold War\\" and the devastating consequences for the Earth when Archer is removed from the time stream.      Extra Features:    Numerous features on the genesis and background of the series are included.  Scott Bakula appears in a featurette to introduce the series. Bakula is also profiled as Captain Archer.  There are also cast impressions of the season and outtakes.      There is an audio commentary track for the pilot, \\"Broken Bow\\", with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and two additional pop-up \\"text commentaries\\" by production staffers Michael and Denise Okuda.      My favorite feature is: \\"Star Trek Time Travel: Temporal Cold Wars and Beyond\\".  The \\"Temporal Cold War\\" of ENTERPRISE is examined, along with all other notable instances of time travel that occurred in the various TREK series and films.     Overall:     I'm sorry I missed STAR TREK ENTERPRISE in its original 2001-2005 run. From this first season - and what I've seen of the second season thus far - it is severely underrated, likely from its having come along at a time when the mass audience (myself included) was suffering a prolonged case of \\"Trek Fatigue\\".      If you are so inclined, give it a chance.  You won't be sorry!
B002ZG9788|3.0|Received DVD promptly.  Watched the movie, great special fx.  It did freeze for a couple of seconds part way through.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|If there is one industry that puts out better products every year, it would have to be the global movie industry.  In the past decade, Hollywood has put out the best comic book movie ever (Dark Knight), the best zombie comedy ever (Zombieland), the best pirate movies ever (POTC 1-3), and now the best Star Trek movie ever.  Coming after a series of so-so Trek films from both the original and Next Generation genres, this is the first Star Trek movie not based on a TV serial.  Instead, all the actors and actresses are new, the soundtrack is new (except for the ending credits), the cinematography, shooting style, ship interior, ship exterior and everything else is new.  Hence a clean slate for the director and for the fans.  The result is probably one of the 5 best movies of 2009, and a movie that should have received a Best Picture nod from the Academy Awards.  The dialogue is engaging, the action scenes are a great mix of drama, tension and chaos, the fight scenes are bloody but not gory, and the movie's pacing is perfect.  Not a wasted scene in this movie, and nothing is left out.  Overall, a great movie.
0596805888|5.0|Meri Melani  Book Review    Cooking for Geeks  By Jeff Potter    The first thing that grabbed my attention was the title and picture on the cover. I just knew I had to read and see what was inside. I am an average cook - nothing too fancy but like to try new things. This book provides basic knowledge for the beginner with stories, tips and tricks and then it can provide information way above the average person. A little of something for everyone.    I was attending a BBQ and was asked to bring a dessert so I chose to make Chocolate Mousse. There are 3 recipes in this book to choose from. 2 of the recipes are on page 264 and one is on 372. I chose the Chocolate Mousse (Whipped Cream Version) on page 264. It was extremely simple and went together with 4 items and 2 bowls and took a total of about 30 minutes. The recipe calls for it to be refrigerated for several hours prior to serving so I made it the day before the BBQ. Once the Mousse was made, I put it into individual pre made pasty cups found at the market. I filled 45 of the cups and there was still mousse left over. I added a dab of whipped cream and a raspberry on top. SUCCESS! The smooth chocolate and whipped cream combined with the tartness of the raspberry was pleasing to eat.     If you need a quick and easy dessert to impress your friends - this is it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Nice to see a movie that seemingly tells it like it was.  What a shame that they now talk about making more movies like this but they will be sure to remove any Christian aspect of it.
0399536108|5.0|The Art of Non- Conformity is life support for your dreams. With it you can work to turn your dreams into your life. Some dreams need five months to become reality, and some need fifty years. This book can help you keep focused and empowered to stay the course.     When the review copy came in the mail,I was delighted to find that Chris  maintained his unique and encouraging voice in the book, as he does so well for the Art of Non- Conformity blog.  I felt encouraged,supported, and understood in my quest for a fulfilling life on my own terms, no matter how unusual my path may seem to others.     The book's best feature is that it encourages productive thought and the embracing of  ideas such as \\"You don't have to live your life in the way other people expect you to.\\"    If we all take that to heart, what joyful freedom could ensue! Think of the possibilities!!
B000002U6E|5.0|...great overall album, I am on my way to ordering all the Enigma CD's. Never disappointed with the music, mood changes, lyrics, etc. I highly suggest this especially for lovers/couples, even though it is still great to listen to alone...
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Only Clint Eastwood could pull this one off with great believability.He studies actors carefully before placing them in his films and it shows.Based on the book by John Carlin \\"PLAYING THE ENEMY\\" it deals with Nelson Mandella using rugby matches to bring people together.Its powerfull message is told throughout the film.Matt Damon is the captain of the scrappy team and Morgan Freeman is Mandella.It runs a little over 2 hrs like most of Clint Eastwood films but its worth it.I never really got into rugby but i wouldn't mind watching it now.I don't want to give away any more of the films focus so i will end with this...Clint shoots and he scores with this one!
6304698526|5.0|I was about to give 5 stars to this movie and to say it's the best thriller I've ever seen, but... after reading a few reviews by other people here at Amazon I changed my mind somewhat. First off, I still like the movie very much. But I have to admit that the plot is standard and predictable, there's nothing special about the story of a corrupt politician, hired killers, mafia connections and a good cop who wins in the end against all odds.<br /><br />The script is average at best, the cast is good but nothing spectacular, except McQueen, who doesn't really perform much, one has to admit. Yes, he looks great for this role, but the role does not require much more than good looks.<br /><br />So what's so great about this film? I think Peter Yates directed everything in this movie, even average things, with such a lot of taste, to the absolute perfection. Especially camerawork, late Technicolor age  obsession with color, perfect eye for the detail, street scene, so much mid-60's spirit in everything on screen - this makes even secondary frames, which might not make sense in a different movie, absolutely necessary in \\"Bullitt\\".<br /><br />Scenes in the bar, in the airport (I'm not mentioning the car chase quite intentionally) are so natural and un-natural at the same time with this Technicolor overdose that images from this movie would be with me forever. Strangely, it brought to my mind \\"The Blast of Silence\\", the 1961 B&W noir by Allen Baron. Surely  McQueen is much more modern than Baron (who directed the film and played Frank Bono, the main character), but there's something about the two movies which brings them together for me, maybe zeitgeist captured with such a great skill and attention to detail.<br /><br />So - five stars to Bullitt after all. And yes, I saw The Getaway. To my taste Bullitt is beyond comparison.The Getaway is just entertainment. Two Lane Blacktop must be mentioned too when talking about Bullitt, surely.
0316067938|5.0|Ok I see there have been over 5200 reviews on this book, sooo I will not even attempt to review.  In the first place I buy books for the pure enjoyment of reading them, not reviewing them. I have read this book twice and have enjoyed both times, the only problem I have with Stephanie Meyers is that she is not (to my knowledge) working on a new project.  I have also read The Host and throughly enjoyed that one too!!!  I sincerely hope they will be making the scripts necessary to put this book on film, whether it be 1 or 2 movies.  I feel this is only fair to the 100's of thousands of readers that have been waiting patiently.  I am not a teenager or a middle aged person, I'm a grannie that believes in reading a book for pure enjoyment and that is exactly what these books have done for me.
B003O86MY8|5.0|I absolutely love \\"Rock Symphonies\\"!!<br />He's included everything from Beethoven to Beatles and each one is uniquely distinctive.  I listen to this collection constantly, but never while I'm driving the car; the rhythm is so compelling that I would probably hit 100mph in record time!
0810983915|5.0|this was a really awesome book!i always read the series all over again every Saturday! its about greg not being able to do anything on summer vacation.then rowley invites him to the beach and he rides a reallyyyy scary ride called the cranium shaker and he hates it! please listen to me....BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
0307454541|5.0|I'm not going to recap the story for you. In fact, don't read any of the reviews because many of them may contain spoilers. Just read the book. Or listen to the audio version as I did. The narrator is very good. This is a perfect mystery thriller. I don't say that lightly. Read it (or listen to it) now.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Ip Man is hands down one of my favorite Martial arts film. As a former Wing Chung practitioner, it was amazing to see pure Wing Chung in action. The story, while embellished, is loosely based on Yip Man's life. This movie has a great story and amazing choreographed fight sequences. You will not be disappointed!
B003YOZNBK|1.0|I've read Jonah Hex for decades.  This movie is Jonah Hex in name only.  I agree 100% with the reviewer said the closest you can come to Jonah Hex would be to watch the \\"Outlaw Josey Wells\\" with Clint Eastwood.  Clint would have been perfect to play Jonah if it was made around the same time as Josey.  I recently saw \\"Batman: Under the Red Hood\\" which had a Jonah Hex animated short on the DVD and it was so much better than the movie.
0393075966|3.0|Were I a teacher and were this book submitted by student, I would mark it as incomplete.  I agree with 50% of what he writes, but several comments are unsupported and off base.  Much of what I agree with, though, is already well plowed ground.    He discusses many of the causes of our current financial crisis, such as, the mal-incentives up and down the mortgage and securitization chain.  He discusses the Fed's malfeasance and the mistakes made by the Treasury Department.  He chastises the Reagan and Bush administrations for deregulation that proved deadly.  He chastises the Obama administration for inadequate economic stimulus.  Interestingly, though, he does not write ill of the Clinton administration in the deregulation fiasco.  He mentions the Glass-Steagall repeal but fails to mention that it was heavily promoted by Clinton's economic team.  The repeal was pushed as a response to foreign competition, and the fear was that New York City would no longer be the world's financial capital.  Of course, Stiglitz was, for two years, a member of Clinton's economic team.  Nor does he mention that the CDS deregulation that allowed the AIG fiasco was promoted and signed by Clinton, that Long Term Capital Management was \\"rescued\\" during Clinton's administration, nor that HUD pushed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into the subprime market and lowered their capital requirement to 2.5%.  These latter pieces of deregulation were to increase home ownership of those with limited incomes.  Interesting omissions all.    He states that Fannie and Freddie did not carry toxic loans on their books but, rather, had only toxic securities.  Reports show that Fannie and Freddie did heavily buy toxic loans in 2005 and 2006.      He also fails to mention that the general public is big on lotteries and provides a lot of income to gambling casinos.  He fails to mention that the general public found TV programs on flipping houses popular, that mcmansions became popular, that vacation homes became popular, etc.  The general public was more than willing to participate in and ride the crest of the subprime bubble.    He fails to find Congress complicit in the deregulation.  Joe Biden, for example, voted for the CDS deregulation.  Chris Dodd voted to end Glass-Steagall.  Barney Frank never found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac posed any risk.  Congress even voted down the Bush II proposal to reign in the risk of Fannie and Freddie.    He recommends that academics could be good regulators when the Fed has had nearly 400 PhDs, and none of them spotted a bubble.  He, somehow, distances regulators from the political process.  Yet, the top regulators are appointed by the president and also report to Congress.  Regulators cannot escape politics.  Right now, the Basel III proposal is to increase capital requirements to no more than 5%.  Some countries do not want to damage their economies by requiring banks to have higher capital ratios.    He recommends quick governmental stimulus, mostly for investment projects, not for consumption.  Yet, one investment he mentions is high speed rail.  That is not a speedy project.  Building one could take 20 years.    One of his goals is to improve financial regulation by creating an international regulatory body.  Yet, we already have the various Basel proposals, and Basel II proved to be a disaster.    Professor Stiglitz, you need to do better
140003180X|5.0|Book number 4 in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is another winner. McCall Smith delights with a simple prose style, insights into human psychology and endearing characters. Like books 1 - 3, The Kalahari Typing School for Men is an easy read. Even when troubles arise, the mood remains positive as humor and inner moral strength win the day.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I purchased BSG complete series on Blu-ray on a whim due to it being over half off.  Let me say having seen the quality of the packaging and BSG in full 1080p, I would have gladly paid full price for this great set.  I read some reviews of a different series collection and people had said that the packaging was poor.  This is not the same set.  The packaging is very polished with all the episodes and special features listed on the back of each season.  Battlestar looks and sounds amazing on Blu-ray.  If you liked the show, you owe it to yourself to get this greas box set, especialy if you didn't get to see it in HD.

1421532255|3.0|L is my second favorite DN and anime character (BB is the first). I read Another Note prior to reading this one and Another Note is by far the superior novel. This book has its pros and cons when compared with the movie that its based off of.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Much more depth into L's character than the movie: The purpose of the movie was to flesh L's character out and reveal his more human side. In my opinion the movie didn't live up to this because the relationship between Maki and L seemed more like \\"carrier and cargo\\" than \\"brother and sister\\". The novel showed a greater and more affectionate bond between L and Maki.<br />2. Far more interesting than the movie: The movie held you interest but I felt that all the characters were a bit dull and un-exciting (especially Near, who just seemed to be stuck into the film for the hell of it). The novel widened the storyline and inserted some much needed humor.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Writing style: At times the novel read like a fan fiction and it made the author seem kinda amateurish.<br />2. Trying too hard to appease to readers: There are some points in the novel that seem to be trying to please every DN Paring fanbase (i.e. a couple of L X Maki moments for those in that fanbase, L's constant fanboying of Misa satisfies the L X Misa fanbase, L's constant mourning of Light's death inspires the L x Light fans, and the scene where L is dressed in drag and wearing too much lipstick is geared towards fans of Uke (Submissive) L)<br /><br />Part Pro, Part Con:<br />L's behavior in the novel is both a blessing and a curse. While his antics provide for a more entertaining and funnier L, they simply are not canon, not consistent with the personality relayed to us by the original mangaka in the series and the comics. I understand that the novel was meant to show L's more human side, to pull him out of the box of 'robotic reclusive detective', but the author tweaked L's character so much to the point it wasn't even L at all. At times it became completely unbelievable that it was him I was reading about, because what he was doing just did not fit. I admit that I did enjoy L's quirky behavior, it made me love L even more, but the fact still remains that it just didn't seem like L.<br /><br />That all being said, I would still recommend this book to major L fans like myself. I wouldn't recommend this however to people who have not seen Death Note or have not read the comics.ll.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|I was debating buying the blu-ray for this movie, since it's quite possibly my favorite horror film of all time. But with the low budget, home video format, I thought the regular dvd would work just fine. I was right. This movie wasn't made for high-def, and it looked just like it did in the theater... Surround sound is still a must though!
B0036EH3XE|1.0|This is how began as a great science-fiction oriented show. Action paced, amazing acting, big budget. But, already in Season Three, it was clear (to me, at least) that the writers did not know where they were going.<br /><br />Also, the producers probably turned the process of casting into a big money game. That's the simple explanation for the huge quantity of characters, even new ones appearing in Season Six! (you can almost visualize the scene: an agent asking the producers: \\"How much do I pay to get my client in the show?\\")<br /><br />The producers sensed they got a steady following (rightly so, judging the so many great reviews) and thought they could get away with murder. So, why bothering explaining the \\"hundreds\\" of unansewred questions? We just tell them that \\"what matters is the journey\\".<br /><br />To me, the ending was a complete swindle on a faithful audience, one that stuck to the show even after the atrocious Season Three.
0743298039|4.0|I am actually torn between giving this book 2 and 4 stars.<br /><br />The story itself is definitely worthy of 4 stars - it is deliciously gothic, very well-paced and the language is wonderful. In fact, I very nearly missed my stop every morning for the past week.<br /><br />However, the one thing that really drove me absolutely up the wall is the inconsistency displayed when indicating what periods of time the two storylines take place in. Everything about the use of language along with the mention of horse-drawn carriages on the streets and the carrying out of everyday communication by letter indicates that Margaret's story takes place around the 1920s or 1930's. However, some not-very-well-off people then suddenly have cars of their own, there are motorized taxis mentioned as an everyday thing, there is a female game keeper, one character runs a catering business, and construction machinery is mentioned, all indicating a modern setting. However, cell phones and the internet do not exist..... Apparently this was done deliberately by the author as a way of creating a timeless story but to me it was simply a source of frustration.<br /><br />I would still recommend the book though on the basis of the truly wonderful storytelling and use of language. It sucks you in from the first page and creates an atmosphere that makes you forget everything around you. I look forward to her next book where she will hopefully have gotten this need to make things overly complicated out of her system :)
B0036TGSR6|3.0|Director Roman Polanski has crafted a stylish yet astonishingly predictable thriller based on Robert Harris' topical 2007 novel. Despite the familiar twists and turns, a strong cast and Polanski's formidable skill maintain interest. \\"The Ghost Writer\\" does not rank with the filmmaker's best work, yet it is miles ahead of earlier misfires such as \\"Frantic\\" and \\"Bitter Moon.\\" Worth seeing for Ewan McGregor's compelling performance in the title role.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was the first Jillian Michaels workout I ever did.  It's not for the weak!!  She will get you into shape, or kill you, whichever comes first :)  Great results if you can build up your endurance and make it through the program.
0316017922|1.0|If you ever need an excuse of why you are not as successful as you think you deserve to be, here is the book for you. Basically, according to this book, success comes down to being in the right spot in the right time- it is that easy. I found his arguments  shallow without real substance, most of his examples conveniently leave out what does not fit his line of thought (such as taking the risk, making the move, working hard to beat the competitor - apparently too trivial for him to consider this part of success as well). You can read along and nod and smile, but once you say, \\"wait a minute, what about ...\\" you are on your own. Waste of time to read it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I caught maybe ONE episode fo Firefly when it was on and remembered liking it, but due to the network pre-empting the show I never bothered to try and follow it after that. Fox did that to a lot of shows then, even The Simpsons and Futurama. Anyway, I saw the movie when it came out and loved it. A week ago I saw Amazon had the entire Firefly series on Bluray for cheap, even cheaper than the DVD set was, so I bought it. Wow... I mean... wow... this is one of the best TV series I've ever had the pleasure to watch. It's so unique, the dialog is amazing and the sense of humor is awesome. It REALLY bums me out this didn't last longer than it did, but I'm glad at least 14 episodes managed to get made. Judging by the sheer number of 5 star reviews here, I bet those responsible for oulling the plug wish they never did that. Thank you to everyone involved in this series.
B000026OW3|5.0|My daughter began practicing her first Chopin piece last week and it prompted me to buy this collection. I've always thought Chopin's compositions were some of the finest piano pieces ever written, not because I'm a pianist, but because I went to a concert years ago that celebrated some of his works and was moved.<br /><br />It's mostly piano solos. Only a few disks does Artur accompany an orchestra. All performed by Artur Rubinstein in the 1960's, which means he was in his 70's at the time of most of these recordings.<br /><br />It's extensive. It's a wide collection and includes nocturnes, polonaises, mazurkas among other styles of compositions.<br /><br />It's well recorded and reproduced. The recording engineers did a great job, especially given how old the recordings are.<br /><br />I play this collection while at work at my art studio. I don't sit and listen to it critically. It's perfect for my needs.
0307269752|3.0|easy now... 'best book of the year'? 'literary masterpiece'?<br /><br />not so fast.  i enjoyed the read and it's got some pretty well developed parts of the story, but it is what it is.  and it's no masterpiece.  it seems these days that works featuring extreme violence, especially those of a sexual nature get such grandiose reviews.  still, lisabeth is an intriguing character and i look forward to reading the next in the series.

159102594X|1.0|I picked this book up after being recommended it about 100x through Amazon. I finally caved in, plunked down some cash, and havent forgotten about my wasted money since.<br /><br />First off, scratch off any notion of similarities that this might have with George Martins Song of Ice and Fire series. Absolutely nothing in this book can even compare to the characters and dialogue of that series. Its quite unfair to think that other fantasy authors should live up to GRRM, but people would be more accurate comparing Abercrombie to the clothes line instead of GRRM.<br /><br />The writing in this book is terrible and it is neither thought provoking, funny, or interesting. The barbarian is dull. The all powerful mage acts anything but and Gloktas constant talking to himself is tedious. Gloktas back story and torture is interesting and unique but that about sums up the positives. Also, Jezel is way too arrogant and childish to be liked.<br /><br />The story also goes nowhere fast. Jezels tournament eats up a lot of time for no need in the end and the epic journey that gets underway left me uncaring.<br /><br />All in all, the only thing i could say good about this book is that i read it at work and was thus making money while reading it.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I bought this based on seeing it live on PBS station, so of course I love it.  Whether you were around when these artists originally were on the scene or are just discovering them now, you have to love Carole King and James Taylor.
055358894X|4.0|I picked this up due to George Martins recommendation on his website and from the cover blurb of this book, which Martin also wrote. It also didnt hurt that Martin wrote one of my favorite series of books in my life. Now, i wish i could high five or chest bump Martin on a recommendation spot on.<br /><br />Locke Lamora is a highly entertaining and interesting new character in fantasy. His adventures, and misadventures, with Jean and his other friends are a joy to read. Lockes humor and sarcastic tones are highly amusing, funny, and gets him some choice reactions with his enemies. His bout with the barrel and his first interaction with the bondsmage, after a very intimidating back story on their powers, were real stand outs. Lockes personality and charm are second to none and really makes for some great scenes. I also love the name Locke, for a thief, and i cant help but thinking about Locke from Final Fantasy, which is always a good thing.<br /><br />The author, Scott Lynch, can also write. Along with George Martin and Patrick Rothfuss, he has some of the best adult writing talent and realistic dialogue out there. Plus the dark humor and action scenes are marvelously realized.<br /><br />But after all the praise, why not 5 instead of 4 stars? Well, for one, the books many coups plot points can get a tad hectic and confusing and while i love Lynchs adult dialogue, there are a lot of curse words and foul language in this book. I know, i know, Locke and his buddies are street kids who grew up in a hard environment, but still, there are A LOT of curse words.<br /><br />Locke and his antics come highly recommended and are the second best current fantasy novels out there, after George Martin of course. Pick this up, you wont be sorry.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick-Ass is a Great ultraviolent movie! If you liked Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) age 17 in Kill Bill, you will love Hit Girl/Mindy Macready (Choloe Grace Maretz) age 13.

159562015X|5.0|This was the perfect solution to a team building exercise with my employees.  In addition to individuals learning more about their own strengths, they learned a great deal about their fellow employees on the same team.  We even took it one step further by having individuals guess 1-2 strengths of their coworkers to see if they knew their fellow teammates (this was done confidentially in the beginning, but as we shared strengths based on the computer output, team members revealed if they were correct in their guesses or not.)

0596805888|5.0|Sometimes I forgot I was reading a cook book. Cooking for Geeks reminds me of other books I've read and they're mostly craft books. Lots of info about the craft, short but inspirational interviews with people who have done amazing things, and projects that are as much about the process as they are the finished object. The book is already being compared to Alton Brown and it's definitely a must read for AB's fans but it's also for people who want to play with food, experiment, and learn by doing.     I love Jeff Potter's attitude about cooking. Especially about failure. You will make things that will turn out poorly so stop worrying and start learning. I've messed up plenty of dishes but it's rare that I can't salvage it in some way and this is one of the few cook books I've seen that encourage that kind of thinking. Most will just suggest a few alternative ingredients instead of leading toward thinking up entirely new applications.     The recipes are more examples of things explored earlier. This isn't a staple cookbook in terms of recipes but it would be very, very good for a beginning cook to have this (as well as anyone else interested in cooking). Concepts, philosophies, and, yes, science are all explored and then demonstrated with recipes. Many recipes have alternate serving suggestions as well.    The section on molecular gastronomy is very cool. I thought I'd never get to do much of that kind of thing since the ingredients and equipment are expensive and it looks rather difficult for a regular home cook. I was wrong! There are plenty of things the home cook can do without breaking the bank. Granted, I now have more agar flakes than I really need but I can give them to friends who want to make panna cotta pie. It'll be like that Amish friend bread recipe only with strange ingredients and probably more taste. And more calories.

B0000CESR7|3.0|This set is a very mixed bag.  If I can overall characterize Chailly's approach to Bruckner, it is one of \\"restraint\\".  He generally does not \\"grip\\" the symphonies and is content to generally (although not always) underplay them.  Sometimes that approach works well (#4, #6, #7), but other times it fails miserably (#1, #9).  The only symphonies in this set I have not heard are #3 and #8, but I'm not aware of any reviews suggesting they are outstanding performances that demand a listen.<br /><br />The highlights of the set are clearly #4-7.  Interestingly enough, those are the only symphonies Bruckner wrote in the major key.  I'm not sure exactly whether this is a coincidence or not.  #4 and #7 are great performances, and #5 and #6 are very good ones.  #2 uses the Haas edition, but the symphony needs a more urgent approach to be effective and in this performance it mostly lies flat after a very strong rendition of the first movement.  #9 is a total failure and worth avoiding.  #1 is a recording of the (inferior) Vienna version and does not make a strong case for it.<br /><br />The sonics of these recordings are perhaps their greatest strength--demonstration sound in many if not most of these recordings.  #4 in particular is outstanding in every way--performance, interpretation, and sound, and would get my vote for the highlight of the set.<br /><br />Bottom line:  The set has its moments, but overall, this should not be the first complete Bruckner set you purchase (Karajan's magnificent box set is clearly the one).  Better choices would be (in order) Karajan, Jochum (DG/Berlin Philharmonic/Bavarian RSO set), and Skrowaczewski.
B000ZELISO|5.0|The first problem may be either a problem with the blu ray format or a problem with my laptop or a combination of both.  I don't know.  The sound on a blu ray disc on my laptop seems to be so low on every one I tried that I usually have to turn the subtitles on to understand all the words.  I have all the sound turned all the way up.  Every other sound is great on my machine except the blu ray movie sound.  Second, and it may not be a real problem, this movie ended rather anticlimactically.  It felt like \\"OK, it's over, \\"insert the final minute of what is seen\\" and then \\"boom\\" with no closure.  I assume, being one of the few people that never read the books, that that will not be a problem because whatever is happening as it ends will make sense after the final two movies.  I really enjoyed the look and feel of the movie itself.  Everything aside from these two problems was lovely about the movie.  I really get a kick out of seeing Bellatrix looking like a Victorian bag lady on meth.
0525950079|5.0|Thank you, Amazon, for the quick delivery & savings purchasing this book!!! Anyone who has read \\"The Pilars of the Earth\\" and thought nothing could be more captivating... read this one too! You will not be disappointed and again you will hate to see it end!!!
B000E1NWJQ|5.0|Begin with the great Fritz Reiner and his Chicago Symphony Orchestra, add the vivid music of Respighi and Debussy, and throw in the RCA engineers (geniuses) of the legendary \\"Living Stereo\\" era.  What follows is a spectacular marriage of performance and fidelity that leaves one breathless.  It is difficult to adequately summarize the jaw-dropping exellence of these recordings, which were first unleashed to the public in 1959 and 1960!  The original vinyl editions have always been praised as sonic showpieces, ideal for flexing the muscles of a high-end stereo system.  This latest incarnation, in the SACD format, manages to grasp what was \\"perfect\\" and make it better.<br /><br />The program includes Claude Debussy's pictorial \\"La Mer,\\" a quintessential masterpiece of the French impressionists catalog.  We also have Ottorino Respighi's \\"Fountains of Rome\\" and \\"Pines of Rome\\" --- two of the three large tone poems (the third being \\"Feste Romane\\") --- comprising his \\"Roman Trilogy.\\"  Each of these works has its own defined mood and personality, with \\"Fountains\\" being the most pensive and subdued.  Maestro Reiner translates the composer's vision with equal sensitivity and flourish.<br /><br />The main attraction here, however, is the thrilling \\"Pines of Rome.\\"  Respighi's masterfully orchestrated work is performed with an intensity that flirts with panic and hysteria, yet everything is totally under control under Reiner's baton.  The finale --- one of the grandest in all of classical music --- will lift you from your seat, regardless of how many times it is heard.  A stunning achievement!!!<br /><br />Planning to be stranded on a desert isle anytime soon?  Take this disc with you.

B003JTHESA|5.0|So, here we are 10 years after the milestone BNW. Come DOD and AMOLAD. What can you expect after 2 average albums? Nothing at all. But this is Maiden we are talking about and they deliver not only a great album but in my opinion one of the best all time Maiden albums. I'm just crazy about this one. I have to be honest, El Dorado didn't quite got my attention but after the first spin I just can't stop enjoying this album. Such tunes as Mother of Mercy or Coming Home are very catchy and more complex songs like The Talisman and Man Who Would be King are indeed great, but Ill have to say that When the Wild Wind Blows is one of my all time favorite Maiden songs. I'm really looking forward for The Final Frontier Tour and I hope they play many songs from this album because it'll be a great show. I hope they stop by Mexico City as they usually do ´cause we are the loudest and most faithful Maiden fan in the whole world. Up the Irons!
B00136Q2EI|5.0|I bought this CD the first day it came out in stores, not realizing that this would be the last Pink Floyd studio album.  As much as I would love to see Gilmour and Waters reunite and release another PF album, this is not a bad way to end.  \\"High Hopes\\" is a great song, comparable to the \\"classic\\" Pink Floyd of the 70's, and if that is the last song on the last album, they've left a great legacy behind them.<br /><br />This is the second album without Roger Waters, and is far superior than the previous effort \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" (although that has some great songs too).  Every song on this one (with the exception of maybe Rick Wright's \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\") is great.  From the somber, bluesy \\"Shine On\\" style instrumental of \\"Cluster One\\", to the Roger inspired acoustic ballad \\"Lost for Words\\" to the Grammy winning instrumental masterpiece \\"Marooned\\", this is classic Floyd.

0143118420|4.0|Let us all be real with ourselves. Somewhere on these pages we were entertained.  There is usually tworeasons for buying a book one is simply to be entertained from the pen of someone else's veiwpoint. Or two if you not buying a book for entertainment, it probably means you want to get the gleen some little knowledge from it, ie purchasing your college textbook, now those books were really entertaining yea- right!!  If is not your own experience then why waste time criticizing some else's experience, basically you end up criticizing what you never experienced.  Rather than spend time criticizing; how about spending more time sharing and healing.  When we share our experiences that we have lived through we heal ourselves and as a bonus sometimes we heal others.  Our gift to others is only truly gifted through what we share. Let's face it no experience is worth experiencing if we cannot share with others.  While sometimes others have experiences that are not our cup of tea but then again it is not our experience- is it?.  For entertainment's sake this book is what it is an experience shared on some pages with a cover and a title. Personally, I think we all need to do more living, sharing of ourselves, and less taking life experiences and others for granted.
B000RIWAVW|4.0|I love how the movie was shot and I love the fall season and where it was shot at. It's a classic that you all probably know about. I'm still not sure if I prefer this over Halloween 2, but they're both good. After the first 3 (even though the third has nothing to do with myers), they go downhill fast. These are the good ones.
B001GCUER0|5.0|This is a truly well done series. If you ever wondered about or wanted to \\"relive\\" the early 1960's, this is your series - it may be slightly exaggerated here and there, but I think it captures things pretty well. This was a very interesting time for America.<br /><br />Lots of things happen in this season. Draper and his wife are going through a split, and Draper heads to California for a while. The California interlude is pretty wild - he meets some jet setters for one thing. We also learn something about his past that was not really shown before. I thought the scene with Draper going into the water with the old country/gospel song about Jesus playing in the background was pretty awesome - even if you don't believe in baptism, it is still powerfully symbolic of change and renewal to come in Draper's life, I think.<br /><br />Mrs. Draper has some adventures too. Really wild there.<br /><br />Peggy is moving up. She even tells about her baby at one point.<br /><br />The ad agency is sold near the end of the season, and this will make for some interesting drama next season I am sure. Duck thought he had Draper where he wanted him, but it appears that this is not the case.<br /><br />The sets and mores of the 1960's continue to be well captured. If you liked season 1, you will like this one as well.<br /><br />You have to watch it!!

It's easy to use, has good flow, and what it has that other books don't is explanations of the dialogues in the text - word for word.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|The fake trailer comes to life thanks to Robert Rodriguez. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a bad ass who rarely speaks during the movie. The story is about him being set up to take the fall against a senator who is against illgeal immagrants. Why explain the story? The movie is full of non-stop action but does follow a story. Some people may hate it though but I really didnt care. The movie looks censored, so it could get an r-rating, but im sure this dvd will be released uncensored. A very good, action packed film with the usual laughs. A must for action lovers. I love how the 80's action films seem to be creeping back, although critics call them failures because they dont make money. Movies like Machete, Preadators, and The Expendables made a great summer. Go out of your way to see this.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Well, the movie was beautiful. Right, we all enjoyed the escape. But it was as good as Iron Man 1? Not at all. There were some problems. Firstly, the chemistry with Ms. Potts seems to have been lost. In addition, the supporting actor, Mickey Rourke, has not been developed and felt very empty. Finally, the final battle of 1000 against the same robots Iron Man and his assistant, has been .... absolutely silent. I wish I could use a better word, but that seems to fit. How did you manage to build character Rourke a hundred robots perfect, without anyone noticing and only a few days time? Low ...
B001O3TCH4|5.0|I have been a BIG Donna Summer fan it seems forever. This c.d. has her voice at its best. Every song  from Love to Love You Baby until the final song I will Live for Love are really worth the price and by chance if you have a Bose radio and c.d. player its like she is singing just to you. Oh by the way I was able to get a fantastic and hard to find deal. I was glancing here on Amazon on music and this one item caught my eye. It was a purple box  and on it was the title Ordinary Girl  (the Journey ) Now inside the box was a book with the same name and It was very easy to read and also told aqbeit was written by Marc Eliot and Donna Summer. It was very easy to read and it told about her whole life and disco career. Now as I took the book out to read it I notived in the center of the botom of the box was a cut out and inside the cut out was yet a Donna Summer c.d. titled The Journey The Very Best of Donna Summer. I have searched all over but I have not been abe to come up with another box like this that had both the book and compact disc inside it. Has anyone else seen or bought this combo of book and c.d. . I think I paid under $10.00 for it and the seller had it rated as in very good condition . I say it came in LIKE NEW CONDITION .
0596805888|5.0|This isn't your traditional cookbook.  This book doesn't have the meat or thoroughness that Alton Brown's books, of which this book will inevitably be compared to, contain.  It doesn't even contain that many recipes.  It's goal strives for two purposes.  On one hand it teaches those who may have cooked before a geek's approach to cooking.  The author provide explanations on the hows and whys of many of the techniques people may have used.  It may also introduce some to the geek culture.  It could have as easily been called Geekiness for cooks.  The book also serves to introduce people in the geek culture to cooking and why it can be of interest to them.  It combines an approach to cooking that may appeal to this mindset.  It also contains numerous interviews that serve to inspire the reader.<br /><br />I would have given this book 4.5 Stars if possible.  I would recommend this book to anyone of who either of the two goals I mentioned might appeal to.

0399536108|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo22YFEK2HJGVDU]]I was a little skeptical at what the book \\"Art of Non-Conformity\\" could teach me, especially since I already read the blog and lived a fairly different lifestyle than the norm. But what I got out of the book is a perspective that just makes total sense. The whole book feels as though your friend Chris is sitting with you over coffee (or a smoothie!) and telling you about his life experiences, and how to make decisions about your own life.<br /><br />The comparison between higher education and blogging was phenomenal. As a blogger I can definitely relate, and as a University graduate I can relate even more. It was like Chris was inside my head, and writing about the things that no one else talks about when it comes to life and career.<br /><br />This is the perfect book for you if you know there's more to life than this, and you don't want another self-help book. This book leads by example, and is non-conforming in itself. It won't prescribe anything, it lets you make up your own mind after hearing the facts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, you'll want to hear about Chris Guillebeau's epic goal to visit every country in the world before he turns 35.
1932100660|5.0|[[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]]<br /><br />My Dad was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008.  After reading this book I am convinced that he would still be alive if we had been armed with this knowledge when he was first diagnosed. His doctors told him to eat a lot of protein.  He was not told about the benefits of eating a plant-based (vegan) low protein diet.<br /><br />He was barbarically given chemo-therapy and radiation after doctors assured him it would increase his survival chances. He suffered in a lot of pain. His doctor recommended and performed an operation to strengthen his hip so that he could walk after the chemo & radiation destroyed his body. (talk about irresponsible medicine) He died in 2009.<br /><br />Dad was always a \\"steak & potato\\" kind of guy and an ex-smoker for over 15 years, but at least having the truth in our hands we could have saved him.  I resent the irresponsibility of much of the medical community in this country. I believe as many do that the health care system in this country is severely broken.  It's time for a major overhall.  Read this book- it will change your life for the better.

0312370849|4.0|WWII. So many stories, so little time. But while most of them focus on the Nazis and their treatment of the Jewish people, \\"Sarah's Key\\" is about the Velodrome d'Hiver, the round-up of the Jews not by the Nazis, but by the French police. Actual French gendarmes rounding up their own countrymen to send them to Auschwitz. It's horrifying, heart-wrenching, terrible.<br /><br />This novel is split at first between Sarah's point of view in 1942 and Julia Jarmond's point of view in 2002, a journalist writing about the round-up in Paris sixty years later. Reading Sarah's story, I was biting my nails, nervous and horrified at her experience when the police came, and in the camps. She was 10 years old. 10. When it was Julia's time to speak, I practically skimmed her story to get back to Sarah's. They eventually merge in the middle and it becomes Julia's voice for the rest of the book, and I have to admit, I was a tad disappointed to no longer hear from Sarah.<br /><br />The way the two characters are connected is surprising and terrible. Everything that happened to the Jews in WWII was surprising and terrible, but this twist in the story, what Sarah found when she returned to Paris and the connection to Julia and her family is emotionally disturbing. The author holds back the secret for as long as possible before it's necessary for her to reveal it. She definitely knows how to keep the reader reading!<br /><br />I had goosebumps when I finished reading the book. It's a good ending. I must say I wasn't a huge fan of Julia because she could get a bit over-emotional at times, but the ending wraps it all up nicely and makes up for that. The chapters are short and quick and help with the pace of the book. I do wish that we could have heard from Sarah a bit longer...<br /><br />It's hard reading a book about so many people suffering. But it's a way of letting them know that you remember and will never forget. WWII was a devastating time for the entire world, and it's hard to believe that people could do such awful things to fellow humans. Even though it was before my time, I read those stories so that I will remember.ul things to fellow humans. Even though it was before my time, I read those stories so that I will remember.
0596805888|5.0|I have received an ebook version of this for review.  The navigation through the eBook was not the best experience I had with the Kindle. But that doesn't really relate to the book.    So, without further ado:  This is not your ordinary cookbook.  It's Cooking for Geeks.  What this means is this.  It means that instead of giving the arbitrary instruction on how to cook, say, a spaghetti and call it a day, it will tell you the underlying principles of how cooking works.  Scientific method is involved:  how about making all variables into a constant, and change this one spice?  Or you can change the amount of spice and see what kind of effect it has on the stuff you're cooking.  When your cookbook starts talking about denaturation of protein (change of protein structure, in layman's term) in different ingredients, that's geeky.    And that's ok.  It makes you look at the kitchen from a different viewpoint.  Every cooking becomes an experiment of sorts, as we think of the ingredients of less of a foreign object and more of one thing that can be used to make the food \\"tick.\\"  Of course, the book also talks about what kind of kitchen utensils you should get and how to care for them.  But while telling someone what to do works for some people, it doesn't work for, say, the geeks.  The \\"common sense\\" we call for while programming or troubleshooting an electronic equipment goes out the window.  This brings it back.    Overall, I feel that it is not your ordinary cookbook.  It somehow makes me wonder if this cookbook will relate to your ordinary housewives, but hey, it's not the book's target demographic, right?    Lastly, I have a feeling that the author likes ducks.
B000007NYS|5.0|I'm a longtime Lucinda fan and this relatively early CD remains my favorite. Every song is special. I particularly love \\"Side of the Road\\", \\"Crescent City\\", and her blues cover of \\"Nothing in Rambling\\".  If you are new to Lucinda, this CD is a great place to start.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Emily Blunt shows why Meryl Streep said that she was the most talented young actress that she's ever worked with in this intimate look into one of England's most famous monarchs.  Blunt gives us a well rounded and well researched performance, something missing from our recent movie history. In scenes that display a 17 year old Victoria backhandedly snubbing the man who would later become the love of her life, she somehow manages to win our understanding and sympathy.  Most people only see Queen Victoria as she was in her later life, as a recluse widow, solemn and gaunt, but this production brings life and vivid color to her little talked of beginnings. As Rupert Friend (Prince Albert) said in the special features, \\"we forget that she was once a 16 year old girl who loved to dance.\\" The production also throws into light how much Victoria and Albert needed eachother to make the era one of the greatest in Britain's history. She needed his coolheaded logic and gentle reassurance to temper her stubbornness, and he needed her energy and drive to get his plans off the drawing board (hinted at quite literally in one scene).  All in all, a beautifully done film that isn't the traditional love story. Most romantic dramas nowadays end when the young couple finally gets together after a long suffering, but in The Young Victoria, the wedding is only the midway point. It guides us through the daze of the honeymoon to the first unintentional insult, the first disagreement, down to the first blowout fight, but always returns to the fact of their mutual all-encompassing love for eachother.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was disappointed with this book. I really liked the first two books, but this one was a disappointment. I was wondering through the whole book if the author had a deadline and rushed through it. It seems like she was going off about things that was not important in this book. and left out alot of stuff that should have been written.
0374158460|2.0|Franzen is indeed a talented writer with great potential to write as well as Tom Wolfe, whom he seems to admire and emulate.  In the early chapters, the story of Patty and Walter Berglund unfolds with compelling command.  However, it then devolves into a boring, ranting, political clunker, filled with long pages of pessimism, cynicism, political lobbying and unlikably selfish, whiny, self-loathing charaters, most of whom are spoon-fed anti-Republican lines that not only get in the way of the story, but also almost certainly are the voice of the author, not the characters themselves.      For example, listen to how the author describes Joey's (a college student with Republican leanings)excitement over a pretty girl:  \\"Jenna excited him the way large sums of money did, the way the delicious abdication of social responsibility and embrace of excessive resourse consumption did.\\"  The Sledgehammer approach to getting Franzen's extreme left wing message out is pervasive.    How about this take on the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal:  \\"There was a stupid smugness to Blake [vulgar next door neighbor and gun-toting republican- subtle!] which .. she equated with the stupid smugness of the special prosecutor who'd made Bill Clinton lie about Monica Lewinsky and the stupid smugness of the congressmen who'd recently impeached him for it...\\"  Really?  Bill Clinton, leader of the free world, was \\"made\\" to lie? Good thing he wasn't \\"made\\" to set off a nuclear war, or we'd really have been in trouble.      The book also attacks George Bush's daughters unnecessarily: \\"The sister's name was Jenna, which in Joey's mind connected her to the Bush twins and all the partying and loose morals that the Bush name connoted.\\" Pretty harsh to compare the underage drinking of a college student [something extremely common on American college campuses] to \\"loose morals,\\" but Franzen gets in every dig against republicans [and their children] he can possibly fit into the slow-turning pages.  In fact, Franzen's characters are against having children, because it may damage the habitat of a West Virginia songbird, so this may explain why children are targets in the novel.  By no means the last example, but nevertheless displaying how Franzen's crazed politics gets shoe-horned into the story, one character, a handsome rock star, is described as looking like Moamarr Qaddafi, Libyan terrorist.  Lock your doors, ladies, there's a hunk on the loose!    You might think I'm a Republican- I'm not!  But, if you aren't a FAR-left-Democrat, prepare to have your values attacked at every level, whether you are Catholic, Jewish, Young, use an ipod, wear flip-flops or eat beef.  As stated above, Franzen's talents do shine in parts, when he isn't ranting, but this book is mostly super-boring, slow moving and uninsightful.  One can only hope he's gotten it out of his system with this book, and his next one won't be such a drag.

B0034G4OU4|2.0|It was a very self-absorbed story and film.  I only stayed until the end, because I wanted to see if this totally selfish, inward person every 'got it'!  I was one of the few who stayed.  People started walking out after about the first half hour and by the time she got to the 'love' portion of the film - the theatre was basically empty.  It was painful to stay until the end.  Was it worth it?  NO.      A person who cannot define themselves without the validation of others, and who moaned and groaned for two and one-half hours?  Unbelievable that someone felt the need to spend millions of dollars to put this into film.  I can only imagine how intermidable it was to try to get through the book.  Again, amazing that this complaining story made it in print!  The only saving grace in the film?  The wonderful scenery and food.  Not enough to redeem this movie; nor good enough for an actress like Julia Roberts.      I read that she is now 'done with Christianity'...well, I guess someone had a revelation!  Although, I might have kept that to myself until the film aired; I suspect that bold statement affected ticket sales, certainly in the US, before the film was released.  I love Julia Roberts, but this was not one of her better moments.  Hopefully, her next film will showcase the wonderful, warm actress that I and others love to see on the big screen!

I read it after them, since they both liked it so much.  I couldn't put the book down.  Of course my reading level is above twelth grade, but adult books rarely have adventure like this.  I mean seriously, most adult books talk about adultery, divorce and many other issues that we already see in real life.  This is adventure and fantasy.

0756405890|3.0|This book is so captivating that it instantly grabs you as you read the beginning chapters of Patrick Rothfuss very entertaining story.  You believe in all that is built around the characters and the horizon looks extremely promising.  And yet, after reading a significant portion of the book, you begin to realize that the story is not advancing in a manner first presented in the beginning chapters, and an enticing book which you thought to be one thing turns out to be nothing more that a puffed up version of Harry Potter.  The author goes at excessive length over the trials and tribulations of the star, but in all of this, you start to lose the whole of the story.  When a school bully (Ambrose) seems more sinister that the over-arching villain (the Chandrian),  you start to lose a bit of interest in the story and conconclusion.  Think more Harry Potter than epic fantasy as Wheel of Time or Raistlin Majere before picking this one up.  It's a great story so far, but there are portions that are drawn out for no reason...
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Its a great buy especially if you're a floyd fan. Echoes and Saucerful of Secrets are my favourites off of this amazing live performance.
B00008CLOA|5.0|The music here on this classic is all great.   Sax solos really put this album into its own. No other album at the time came close.  I remember listening to it with my high school friends on the weekends and it was great.  Made everyone a little too introverted, but what the hell.  When you are young, you are young and you have time to literally waste.    Definitely needs to be listened to from start to end.  Especially if you want to take a mini-vacation away from the daily grind for a few days.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love the stories, and will read the others, but I found them a little too simple for an adult. Maybe it's because I'm used to something more intricate, maybe I read these as a child and I just don't rememberit - and the answers are already in my head. While I wasn't as smart as Holmes, it was close. I guess I expected something more challenging. Besides what seems like obvious outcomes, even for me (i.e. I don't like to try to solve the ending, I like the ride), I did find the reader and the writing/stories entertaining. Essentially, I gave it a 5 for that, and a 3 for story depth.
B001TK3XOA|5.0|I found this book transformational.  I also found that reading and listening to the audio simultaneously helped me be present as I experienced Tolle's teachings. I found this book to be a layered building of understanding to help one awaken.  Complementarily, I felt that the book Power of Now was a wonderful follow on book after reading this one (eventhough it was published before A New Earth).  The Power of Now, which is organized as a discourse, brings together concepts in each Q&A response that are very deep.  These concepts are so well delved into in A New Earth that I was able receive the Power of Now's teachings more effectively.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This set was nicely done. The &#34;On-location&#34; vignettes gave great insight into the preparation and effort involved in delivering such a great documentary.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I loved this for what it was and was not. It was ok that you didn't know much about the parents, including their names. You rarely heard any spoken words from the adults, and for me it didn't matter because I couldn't understand three of the languages. This is a visual feast of babies, cultures, and sounds.  It's about how babies interact with their world.<br /><br />There are four star babies:  2 boys and 2 girls. They live in 2 cities (Tokyo and San Francisco) and 2 remote country settings (Mongolia and Africa). Each baby has their distinctive personality that is seen early on.<br /><br />The details of the babies' homes were fascinating. The surrounding landscapes were beautiful, from the cityscapes to the open fields and mountains. The babies' first events such as sitting, talking, crawling, walking, meeting the relatives are adorable and fun to watch. The baby's responses are shown by watching their faces, hearing the sounds they make, and watching them put their whole body into a reaction.  A few of the highlights for me were the trip to the supermarket, the fascination with bugs, and meeting with unknown adults. Their interactions are honest and innocent.<br /><br />There are so many ways to watch this film. You can just enjoy the beautiful babies and their world. You can be amazed and be reminded of the innocence babies start out with. You can see universal truths in people through the actions of babies. You can debate, is it nurture and/or nature that shapes us the most.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film and would love to see how life turns out for these four stars.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Singing the Great American Songbook requires a singer--no a screecher. The material belongs to Sinatra, Damone, and Bennett and anyone else with a voice. The public should be spared from this garbage.
0765326353|4.0|Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings can be summed up in one word, Epic, also the word \\"Long\\" can describe it but Epic just has a better ring to it.    I recall Brandon saying that he always had a hard time describing the book, Now I know why. There is a whole lot going on in this book. Most of the story follows a young man named Kaladin, as he goes from respected young soldier and leader to a slave in a horrible and pointless war. A second story arc follows a young Noble Woman named Shallan on her journey to become a Ward of the powerful princess Jasnah. Dalinar is a Warlord who has grown tired of war and killing. His story also serves as a counterpoint to Kaladin's story giving the reader another perspective of his story.    Kaladins story was my favorite by far. His life as a Bridgeman and his rise above it was inspiring and resonated with me deeply. Sanderson uses flash backs to earlier points in Kaladin's life which give the reader a much deeper understanding of the Man. I felt these Flashes were done well, I truly wanted see how the young boy on his way to being a surgeon, became a slave preforming the worst job ever conceived of.    Dalinar Kholin is a Brightlord and Highprince in the Kings army. He is a man of deep moral covivctions and sense of duty. He is also plagued by visions of the past, which warn of an impending doom for all men. While Kaladins story is of a young mans journey towards leadership, Dalinars is of a leader faceing the decision to step aside or to trust in his proven abilities even when all around him say he has lost it. His story complimented Kaladins nicely in my opinion, serving to enhance both arcs nicely. Also his story appears to have to only romantic story arc in this book, which is one of the few things lacking in this book.    Shallan is a young noble woman with a problem, her family is going broke. She has sought out the Princess Jasnah. Her intention is to become her ward and begin training under her tutelage. But her true motivation is to steal a very valuable and powerful device from her. In this world Men and Woman have certain roles which are divided into either Masculine or Feminine. Men are involved in all things warlike and women all become scholars or at least follow scholarly pursuits and studies. For instance men can not read or write, this means that woman must read aloud to them from books write letters for them. Shallans story offers much to learn of this world covers alot of exposition, which makes her story a little flat. Although her story has lots to enjoy it felt like filler to me many times. But I must say I love her note book and Jasnah is one of my favorite characters in this book.    The Way of Kings is broken into 5 parts with and interlude between each. These interludes are filled with many characters from over the world but none have an impact on this story except one. The character Szeth son son Vallanos Truthless of Shinovar, I really enjoyed his Interludes, action packed and full of awesome. I really look forward to seeing more of him in the future.    This is a Brandon Sanderson book so we know we will get an interesting magic system dropped on us. This magic system is another action packed system on par with that of the Mistborn books. It is all based in a world with rules and relies heavily on physics in functionality. I didnt feel this one was truly fleshed out as much as some of his other system but it was simple to grasp but obviously deep and intracate to. This is something Sanderson always excels at.     Also this book has a number of illustrations in it which help the reader to visualize this world. They are very well done and fit into this book well. In fact the entire presentation of this book is marvelous, from the illustrations and maps to the chapter icons, not mention a beautiful cover, make this a must own book in hard cover. (also if Tor books would like to tank me for making that statement, i take cash)                I truly enjoyed this book, the world is deep and rich, only Robert Jordan has a world more fully realized world then this one. This world is unique in may ways, it has a deep history all of which seems to be inaccurately remembered by the populace. Everything from the plants to the animals feels natural to this world and even the currency is tied deeply into the worlds setting.    If you love epics this book is for you. It has parts that felt a little shallow but on the whole it was a great ride and I eagerly await the next installment.    Life before death  Strength before Weakness  Journey before Destination
0374158460|2.0|My book club chose this book.  I am usually open to any type of book.  I have never read or will read this author again.  His characters were not \\"likable\\", and neither is his viewpoint or style.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|\\"The American\\" is one of the slowest paced action/thriller films I've seen in a long time. In the beginning scenes in Sweden we see the killer instincts of its protagonist, Jack (George Clooney), who is an efficient killing machine. Jack goes on the run to Italy where he receives his orders in succinct telephone messages from a devious double-dealing Pavel.<br />He goes to a mountain town in Abruzzi where we see that Jack is losing his edge, his mojo. He's beginning to crave human contact and love which can get him in trouble. He's an armorer who is making a precision sniper rifle for a female assassin. How he gets the necessary equipment in his apartment is a mystery in itself. There are long passages demonstrating his gun-making skills. He's a very clever gunsmith but an ineffective human being. He falls in love with a prostitute, and slowly through his friendship with the local priest he has an epiphany. He's haunted and hunted. It has some very erotic, steamy scenes.<br />Lately as in \\"Up in the Air\\", Clooney has been taking these parts of men with ice in their veins, soulless entities, loners who learn too late that they can no longer reach out to get human contact and redeem themselves. Jack is basically a sociopath seeking solace and love.<br />The movie has great photography and fine views of the Italian mountain region, but like Jack viewers may find something lacking.
0765326353|5.0|There isn't much more I can say in this review that hasn't already been said. The best I can offer is that I absolutley loved every page of this book. I found the pacing to be perfect, and I was into the book from page 1 onwards. Not only is the world building, characters and plot various levels of awesome, but the fact that Sanderson was willing to take the risk of confusing some of his readers by writing sections that served the purpose of expanding the visibility of his cosmere (the universe in which all his epic fantasy novels exist) simply added to this novel in a way that no other writer really could. It also helps that it was one of the best looking books I've ever read. Mistborn was already one of my top five fantasy series and The Way of Kings was not only his greatest book, but has the potential to easily become my favorite fantasy series ever. Of course, people look for different things in fantasy novels, so their is a chance that if you who really prefer the dark, gritty stuff thats been coming out over the last fifteen years (and don't get me wrong, I like that stuff too) then The Way of Kings may not be for you. My best advice would be for anyone who is at least mildly interested in the book to check it out, there's a pretty good chance you'll love it.
0439023513|5.0|After Catching Fire, I was very impatient to find out what happened to Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Prim, Finnick, and the entire cast of characters.  Once again Suzanne Collins took the plot someplace unexpected. Pretty much the entire book is tense and uncomfortable, but that is what made it so real for me.  The entire premise of pitting children against each other in a 'game' of death to keep the population subdued is terrifying. However, Ms. Collins balances the negativity with the positive love Katniss has for her family and friends. She created truly inspiring characters. This book is thought-provoking, interesting, and relevant. It is definitely going on my 'keeper' shelf--right next to the first two books in the trilogy!
B003A6C67G|5.0|this whitesnake deluxe edition cd set is one of the last hard rock cd's to be called \\"REAL HARD ROCK MUSIC\\" the bonus tracks and the dvd are too cool!!!!!!!!! if u want REAL HARD ROCK MUSIC from the late 80's... then buy this cd set!!
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Everyone can tell you put a \\"invisible\\" SHIELD on your phone. And it really sucks. The way how it looks and when u touch it u feel worse. Just check powersupportusa come out with their iPhone 4 Film and order one. I believe they are times better. I used their film for my iphone 3gs before and it works well. I really should just wait for them, not to waste 14$ on some ZAGG.
1577312082|5.0|These CDs (also available in book form) detail Eckhart Tolle's teachings on how to achieve personal enlightenment and experience being. They encompass mindfulness, but add a spiritual element which includes all faiths and religions. If you are into self-knowledge, this is definitely something to listen to or read. It's not an instruction manual on how to cope with life in the modern world; instead it opens our minds to what we have within us, and what we have perhaps not recognised before.
1844257797|4.0|As usual, the Haynes manual delivers the goods. I enjoy the author's writing style on this one...a little less dry than most repair manuals which makes it more engaging to read. Some of the steps jump around a bit between the various models in a given procedure and consequently can make it a little difficult to follow i.e. you can't skim through it! Best to read through the steps first and maybe highlight the sections that pertain to your bike (mark up a copy) before launching into the work. There is one glaring omission I've come across so far and that is the procedure for the all important bleeding of the brake control circuits. Not really sure why they didn't include it since it's not difficult to do-and as mentioned, is a very important maintenance procedure that you will be doing regularly throughout the bike's life. Not to worry though...this critical info may be found online on an excellent forum dedicated to these bikes.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Classic jazz stylist and a great artist.  Took a long trip and played her music almost all the way!
0385504225|4.0|I understand the criticism that this book has received, but I found it to be an incredibly engrossing experience.  The pacing kept me turning pages into chapters, which is quite the feet, seeing as I'm a medical student, and as such, am not particularly overburdened with excess time. Furthermore, I must say that the plot twist nearly had me drop the book right there in the floor and give a slow clap.  It was a very refreshing twist.  Reading all the rest of Dan Brown's novels left me with a keen eye as to what the plot twist would be, but I thankfully can say that this one threw me for a loop.  That being said, after the plot twist the pacing comes to a screeching halt.  The last 50 pages or so literally felt like a chore, I had an obligation to end the book, but it was painfully slow.  All in all, putting the negatives aside I still enjoyed myself and don't feel cheated by the experience; therefore, I would definitely recommend this romp through good old American history to any who are familiar with the work of Dan Brown.
B000W00FB2|5.0|This album is VERY DARK! When I listen to it, it makes me think of the movie SEVEN, or something along those lines. I can envision the taped off crime scenes or  something like that. It is different from the album, DUMMY, but I think that's a good thing. That just shows versatility. But I wouldn't listen to this album after midnight. You'll never get to sleep....it's that creepy. Still, I loved it!
6305014140|5.0|Great movie, a bit old school but most anime these days really doesn't compare to the quality of this movie. It encapsulates all of the great things that anime lovers crave. Great story line, action sequences, beautiful animation, etc. If you haven't seen it and are on the fence about purchasing you should rent it first (netflix) or just buy it. This is definitely one for the collection.<br /><br />Only bummer is they don't have it on Blu-ray just yet :-)
030745455X|5.0|I want to let you know how pleased I am with Lilly Street Books.  They are a small business out of their home and they got the book The Girl Who Played with Fire by Stieg Larsson to me amazingly fast. I heard from them the day after I placed the order and they had already mailed the book to me.  Considering there was a weekend and a holiday, they still got the book to me in less than a week!  A five star experience.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I just started reading lee child this year and have loved each and every book.  I am reading in order, so I only have a few to go....
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I really wasnt sure what to expect with this movie, but after watching it all I can say is wow. This is definitely one of the better movies Ive seen in a long time. All the lead characters did a good job with Hit Girl as a big stand out. I really hope they do a sequel.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was very excited for this last book to come out.  I did like it, but I have to say that the very first one was my favorite. Hunger Games had me hooked throughout the whole book. The author was so creative w/ the plot and how Panem would really be. The second book, Catching Fire, was also a very good sequel.  She picked up right where Hunger Games ended. My only critique of Mockingjay was that she sort of went overboard w/ the creative juices. Some of the things that took Katniss through this final stage of rebellion just seemed like a lot of fluff to get more pages in to the book. I would have liked for there to be a little more concentration of the characters relationships to eachother. But all in all, I did like it. It was worth the read.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|I absolutely Love,Love, LOVE this Twilight Eclipse Soundtrack. however make sure you purchase the Deluxe Edition, or you will miss out on two amazing tracks spend a little extra you won't regret it. And if you have not seen the movie yet well shame on U, however if you have not seen this amazing movie yet listen to the soundtrack before then after viewing the movie you'll see what i mean, YOU WILL BE TOTALLY ADDICTED TO THIS SOUNDTRACK, even if you don't like the film but, how can you not love the vampire werewolf epic battle scene my only complaint it wasn't long enough but since this is the soundtrack review not the movie review let me again say Just Get It U Won,t Regret It.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I didn't want to like X-Men Origins: Wolverine When it was announced the movie was in the works, along with X-Men Origins: Magneto, I cringed. I cringed because it reeked of gimmick. What Marvel Comics does (to be fair, DC Comics does the same thing) is create an \\"event\\"-a rather long and convoluted storyline-that is spread out over every title published by Marvel Comics. The reader is almost forced to buy every single comic in Marvel's lineup in order to understand what is going on in the story.<br /><br />At $ 3.99 a comic, the gimmick pays off quite well for Marvel. It was also announced, around the same time, that there would be a Captain America movie (Captain America: The First Avenger; which is now being filmed), followed by a Thor movie (again being filmed), and then another Iron Man movie (Iron Man 3 for those of you keeping score). After all three of these films are completed Marvel Studios is going to start production on an Avengers movie. The Avengers movie will star all the players from the other Marvel movies, including Edward Norton as the Hulk. I can only assume that the major players signed contracts stating that they would do an Avengers movie.<br /><br />Seeing Marvel Studios trying and pull the same gimmick in the movies left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I already had a biased view of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I knew that it wasn't going to be any good. There was no way that this was going to be any good. However, a funny thing happened on the way to the ending credits. I started enjoying Wolverine.<br /><br />It isn't an Academy Award winning movie by any stretch of the imagination. The movie has its fair share of problems, but with these kinds of movies you have to expect some problems. For instance, after only one mission we are suppose to believe that Logan, Victor Creed and the rest of the commando unit are a tight knit group. I can buy that the rest of the group as a tight knitted group because we are told how they went on more missions after Logan left. But, how the whole group was tight with Logan is a mystery because they were only on one mission together.<br /><br />What sets the movie in motion is the death of Logan's girlfriend, Kayla. Of course, she never died. It turned out that she was given a drug that slowed her heart down so that it appeared that she were dead. It's a pretty bad story device, but Shakespeare did the same thing, right? However, when he wrote Romeo and Juliet it hadn't been done a million times. But this isn't Shakespeare it's Wolverine. As far as storytelling is concerned, using the fake death ploy is not only played out, but it's a device used by weak writers. What makes her \\"death\\" even more ridiculous is the character of Wolverine. Wolverine is supposed to have heightened senses-smell, vision, taste, the whole nine yards-he would have known that Kayla wasn't dead. I watch enough TRU TV to know that dead bodies don't give off heat. Of course, it would take some time for the body to grow cold, but he would have felt her body growing colder.  It gets even worse when we see Victor Creed pouring blood on her to \\"further\\" the illusion. Maybe I am going out on limb here, but wouldn't fresh blood smell different than blood that has been stored in a refrigerator somewhere? And why wouldn't he have noticed that there wasn't a mark on her?<br /><br />It In Wolverine we finally learn how Logan lost his memories and the reason is just as cheesy as the faked death. It turns out that a bullet- an adamantium bullet- in the brain is the reason. But, we've seen Logan take a bullet to the brain before and nothing happened to him.<br /><br />I need to point out that when we saw him get shot in the head in X-Men 2 the bullet was in his head. It didn't ricochet off his adamantium skull; the bullet went into his brain. We even see it pop out when he heals. So, why did one bullet take his memories and the other one didn't? Now I'm not a brain surgeon or a metallurgist, so I am only guessingwhen I say that any type of metal shot into your brain is a bad thing. The writers and the director could have chosen any number of ways that his memories could have been erased. For instance, they could have said that the process of grafting adamantium onto his bones was so painful that his mind shut down as a means to cope with the pain. There could have been some sort of malfunction to the equipment that resulted in the memory loss. An even better reason would be that his memories were erased on purpose!<br /><br />Think about it. If you were the mad scientist creating the ultimate killing machine wouldn't you have wiped his memories? When he learns what you did to him and his girlfriends don't you think that he would be a little ticked off? Think of your own reasons. Anything would have been better than the reason that we were given.<br /><br />I hate to say it because I like Ryan Reynolds, but there was zero reason that he should have been in the movie. Well, I guess there is one reason-Reynolds had already been cast to play Deadpool (A movie spin-off of a movie spin-off. Yeah, there's not gimmick there) in the upcoming movie. He delivers his lines in his trademarked sarcastic tone, but you get the feeling that there is somewhere else that Reynolds wants to be.<br /><br />I know that it sounds like I just tore the whole movie apart, but I still found things in the movie that I enjoyed. The staples of superhero movies are well represented. Things blow up, guns are fired in ultra-cool ways, and bullets are sliced in mid-air. The special effects are great. The stand out scene is when Deadpool's head, eyes still blasting lasers, falls down one of 3 Mile Island's cooling towers and cuts it to pieces.  Watching it crumble to the ground was a visual treat.<br /><br />The fight scenes were well choreographed with no restrictions on cable work. In the opening credits we follow Logan and Victor as they move through history one war after another. Each war, beginning with the Revolutionary War, seamlessly flows into the next war finally stopping during the Vietnam War. Not only do the opening credits show the audience that the two characters have been around for centuries, it also manages to show what turned Victor into the monster that we see during the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Wolverine is just as good as, if not better than, other superhero movies. Which to some people is not saying a lot, but if you look at the three main roles Wolverine does have a lot more talent than some other superhero movies. Hugh Jackman is a talented actor. To say that he is not a talented actor is simply not true. If you don't want to watch him sing and dance (which he has received a Tony Award for) then watch The Prestige, The Fountain, or Deception for proof that he has talent.<br /><br />Jackman gets to a do little comedy to lighten the mood. Liev Schreiber, as Victor Creed, and Danny Huston, as William Stryker, compliment Jackman's performance perfectly. Before he came to the attention of mainstream audiences as Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy, Schreiber starred in independent and small budget features. However, it has been in movies like The Hurricane, The Manchurian Candidate and Defiance that Schreiber has made a name for himself. He's often cast in good guy roles. As Victor Creed, he gets to show us that he can do mean and nasty too.<br /><br />I have a list that I call \\"You May not Know the Name, but You Know the Face.\\" I'm always adding names to it, but rarely am I taking names off. Danny Huston is easily in the top ten. If it weren't for the make up, that made him almost unrecognizable, fans of the comic genre would recognize him as the head vampire, Marlow, in 30 Days of Night. Others may remember him from The Number 23, Children of Men, Edge of Darkness,and in the critically acclaimed HBO mini-series John Adams.<br /><br />A lesser actor would have portrayed William Stryker as a crazed maniac, a Dr. Frankenstein screaming \\"Its alive!\\", but not Huston. Huston plays Stryker with more reserve that manages to bring out the character's obsession more than any over the top acting could do.<br /><br />There is a bigger reason why I liked Wolverine. What's that reason? I turned my brain off. Maybe not completely off, but definitely down several notches. You almost have to when you watch a superhero movie. For the most part, superhero movies are garbage. If you try and tear them to pieces, as critics like Ebert and Roper do on a regular basis and that I have briefly done, you won't enjoy them for what they are- good, mindless entertainment.<br /><br />Do you have to be a comic book fan to enjoy Wolverine? No. In fact, you will enjoy the movie more if you aren't a comic book fan. You won't get bogged down with the things that will perturb your average comic book reader. Just be a fan of good action movies, turn the DVD player on, your brain off and enjoy the movie.ng during the Vietnam War.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|I did not like this movie at all.  It was so awful I had to retire it to my never ever watch again file.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|(SPOILERS AHEAD!) Don't worry if you didn't see this movie in the theaters or haven't had a chance to rent it, because you've seen this movie before. Adventureland follows an old formula: boy meets girl. Boy and girl fall in love. Something happens that make boy and girl break up. Of course, they still love each other. Then something happens that brings boy and girl back together.<br /><br />It's not that formulas are bad. Plenty of movies are based on the same concepts and ideas. For example: Something tragic happens to character X's family. Character X seeks revenge. Character X gets his revenge. Apply this formula one way and we get The Outlaw Josey Wales. Apply it in another way and we get Punisher: Warzone. The difference is the first movie had something to say and the second movie was an excuse to show explosions on the big screen.<br /><br />Adventureland falls into the second category of a movie that has nothing to say. Greg Mottola, who directed Superbad, brought nothing new to a crowded genre of movies saying the same thing. It's Say Anything without the boom box. It's Jerry Maguire without the \\"You had me at hello.\\" It's The Notebook without the notebook.<br /><br />I could almost forgive Mottola for creating a movie that has no interest in being anymore than what it is. Not every film can have a defining moment that captures an audience's heart or defines a generation. However, every movie should have characters the audience cares about. There should be some connection between characters in a movie and the audience. Audiences wanted Marty McFly to get back to the future just as much as they wanted Biff to get his @ss kicked. We loved Marty; we hated Biff. However, we had a connection with Biff, because we have all known a Biff that we wanted to punch in the nose.<br /><br />Mottola failed to create and develop characters that we care about one-way or the other. If James and Em get back together, that's fine. If they don't get back together, that's fine. If Mike is cheating on his wife, that's fine. If they all get hit by a bus, that's fine too. The impression is that Mottola doesn't care about his characters and if a director doesn't care about his characters then why should we? It's a shame, because the film has a very talented roster.<br /><br />In the lead role of James is Jesse Eisenberg. James is the self-deprecating, uncomfortable, nerdy guy who is figuring out life. Eisenberg is perfect in the role. He has perfected this same character in other movies like Rodger Dodger and The Hunting Party. It was the same character he played in Zombieland (hmmm.....Adventureland to Zombieland. Coincidence? ).<br /><br />Playing Eisenberg's love interest is Kristen Stewart...give me a moment to regain my composure.... Stewart plays Em, the girl that shows James the amusement park ropes. I will go on record right now saying, \\"I like Kristen Stewart.\\" She reminds me of the girl in school (high school, GED classes, college) who is hotter than a three-alarm fire, but has a low self-esteem. You know the girl who covers everything, from the bangs that go past her eyes to the baggy clothes that cover everything else. The girl who thinks that she has to look weird and reject others before they can reject her. The girl who could have anyone, if she were to give it half a chance.<br /><br />Of course, James falls deeply and madly in love with her before she even opens her mouth. I don't blame the guy; it's Kristen Stewart! However, there is not one single moment in the film that we can see a spark between the two of them. The movie goes from the two of them meeting and then jumps to them being in love. It just happens and we have to go along with it, because Mottola hasn't given us any other choice.<br /><br />In this type of movie there is always something that tears the happy couple apart. Playing the wedge that comes between James and Em is Mike, played by Ryan Reynolds. I like Reynolds as an actor. He has talent and in movies like Adventureland, he gets to show it. Too often we see Reynolds in movies where he is the smart @ss or the class clown. I admit it; he does a great job in movies like Van Wilder, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and Waiting. But, it's movies like Definitely, Maybe, The Nines, and The Amityville Horror that we really get to see Reynolds shine.<br /><br />Mike, the amusement park's handy man, had an affair with Em. James freaks out after he learns that the two of them had something going on in the past. Of course, he doesn't want to see her again. This isn't the sad moment that it should be because Mottola has shoved on us a love connection between James and Em that we never believed in the first place. We still don't care when James realizes he made a mistake dumping a hottie like Kristen Stewart and tries to win her back.<br /><br />The real gems in this movie are Bill Hader and Kristnen Wigg. You may remember Hader as Seth Rogen's cop partner in Superbad and Wigg from Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Both actors are hysterical as the owners of the amusement park where James and Em work. They steal every scene that they're in. Unfortunately, neither one of them are on screen long enough to save the movie.<br /><br />You won't regret watching Adventureland, but there are better flicks that deserve your time.lds in movies where he is the smart @ss or the class clown.

1440469563|4.0|I've read only Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen before, and I am a huge lover of that novel. As such I've been somewhat (stupidly) hesitant to read other Austen novels - for surely nothing could live up to that book!<br /><br />I finally have read Sense and Sensibility and I am sorry that I did not read it earlier. I must say that S&S was a very easy and accessible book to read. The plot wasn't overly complex and it did not feel bogged down and dense like some old classic novels can. I think this would be a great book for someone who wants to read classics but who is worried or scared to.<br /><br />The two main characters are easy to love and I was wondering what would happen the whole way through. Without saying anything specific, Austen kept me on my toes and I was very satisfied with the ending.<br /><br />Now I'm off to read more of Austen's books!

For one the complete collection is supposed to include a copy of the the first episode script and a book that gives episode information, well neither came.

B002ZG993Q|3.0|If there was ever a need for a three-and-a-half-star rating, it's for Anton Corbijn's \\"The American.\\" The movie manages to lift itself out of mediocrity, but just barely. After a suitably shocking beginning by a frozen Swedish lake, the movie goes into hibernation with George Clooney, playing a hit man and gunsmith whose shadowy boss (Johan Leysen) orders him to lay low in a sleepy Italian hill town to await further orders.<br /><br />Corbijn and screenwriter Rowan Joffe make the point that Clooney's life is dullness punctuated by violence; unfortunately, in the first half, they make it all too well. However, the film gains in interest as Clooney begins to wonder just who and what he can trust. Are supposedly friendly people gunning for him, or is his paranoia working overtime?<br /><br />\\"The American\\" is a throwback to the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, featuring antiheroes with mysterious pasts and bleak futures. It has several redeeming features; Paolo Bonacelli gives an interesting performance as an elderly, world-weary priest, and Martin Ruhe captures some glorious photography of the Italian countryside and of the naked flesh of Violante Placido, an actress with the same ripe beauty as the young Isabella Rossellini. As for Clooney, he doesn't give his best performance here, but it's the performance the material calls for. \\"The American\\" is no masterpiece, but it's a decent movie of its type.
014043786X|5.0|I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old.

No reason to ever take it off.     + Great looking.  + Solid stainless steel  + Looks authentic. I.e. it looks like a cool genuine Seiko divers classic - and doesn't try to imitate the fancy name brands out there.  + Excellent Seiko service (in my 20yrs experience - and prior 20yrs in my father's experience). My current watch recently started gaining an hour a day! I sent it to Seiko service centre in NYC - was out of warranty, so had to pay a few $$$ (fair enough).  They fixed it quick. Now its right as rain)  + Value.  If you loose it, or in the unlikely event it becomes un-serviceable: You can buy a new one without needing to sell the car. Which is why I wear this when surfing/ sailing/ diving or generally being active - rather than some more expensive watch.       = Good (not great)accuracy for an automatic (will gain a few seconds a day if you're active).   Perhaps not quite as accurate as a more expensive 23 or 27 jewel movement, but not a big deal.     - Rubber strap (I don't like them - sweaty)  - Seiko aftermarket brand stainless steel bracelet is good and solid BUT ultimately fastened with a relatively simple spring loaded pin. But if you do loose it, see last + above.

0671027344|5.0|If there were ever to be a book written about my life (my life's not book-worthy in any way, but go with me for a minute), I definitely think it would've been called The Perks of Being a Wallflower (you know if things like copyright and patents weren't in the way). Wallflower. That's how everyone describes me. They're constantly moaning and groaning about how I let life pass me by and don't \\"participate\\" in it (can you tell the people telling me this are so not readers?). This is sort of what Charlie's going through (plus a whole lot of other angsty things), so right from the beginning, I sympathized with the narrator.<br /><br />The thing about Charlie is that he's sensitive. He's one of those kids that doesn't speak much, but is always looking, so much that people constantly ask them \\"What the hell are you looking at?\\" If we aren't particularly that person (all you extroverts out there!), then you at least know who I'm talking about because they're the person sitting next to you on a bus or across from you at the coffee shop. Sure, Charlie cries a little too much (he cried more in the span of 218 pages than I've cried my whole entire life), but he's a sweetie pie. You just want to hug him tight and say \\"Everything will be all right\\", even if it is a tremendous lie.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is angst supreme. Everything you or your friends have ever been through in high school is described in this book: drugs, sex, dating, homosexuality, trying to find who you are, it's all there. So much of that is in here that, a few years ago, some idiot tried to ban it saying it wasn't appropriate for middle school and high school students (the chances that he actually read the book are slim to nil, but anyway...). I, of course, disagree just on principle (I'm so against the banning of books), but also having read the book, I honestly don't see how anyone would want to ban it. Here we have a brutally honest account of what it's like to be in high school. Sure, some students high school lives are probably not as dramatic as Charlie's, but there are others who have gone through some of the things mentioned in the book. And The Perks of Being a Wallflower doesn't shy away from the unpleasant.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I thought it was a thoughtful and engaging read. But also the fact that I really identified with Charlie was what really turned this book into one of my favorite reads. This is just the perfect book for all of us socially awkward introverts who maybe don't break out of our shells as much as other people wish us to.high school lives are probably not as dramatic as Charlie's, but there are others who have gone through some of the things mentioned in the book.

0312600844|5.0|In Franzen's first novel in nine years, he again focuses on family and the social structure of contemporary times, and does so with a laser-pointed pen. Patty and Walter are powerfully palpable, and to a lesser but still compelling degree their son, Joey, and their best friend, Richard Katz defy clich&eacute;. This novel hits its stride immediately, and continues to get better and better, and progresses to rare species. Not one dull page or false note. This is a siren of middle-class existential angst.<br /><br />If you specifically detest novels of existential angst, OK, skip this. A fair warning. However, Franzen, in my estimation, does not toil or stall in the potential pitfalls of this theme and context. He has an exquisitely metered balance of scorn, mockery, truculence, and self-scorching--the traits that often dominate a domestic drama when the tone is ironic. There is nothing heavy-handed or phony here.<br /><br />There are beautiful moments of self-awareness and growth. And this is where Franzen's brilliance is doubly conveyed. In a ribald bathroom scene, there is a unique and astonishing act of indelicacy where Joey's evolution is combined, and actually self-realized, with the darkest of matters. This alternately comic and horrifying scene instigates Joey's self-discovery and surprises the reader with its unusual cleansing of the soul.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain that he has no tone. As I posted in a comment earlier, the tone is sardonic--slightly more sardonic than The Corrections, and carries with it Franzen's dry subtlety. Actually, it is the tone that conveys the lacerating narrative observation. You can hear the voice simultaneously wafting from an aerial position and a position of mock polarity. His minimalist but anchor-weight tone allows a vast breathing space for the characters to flex and develop without authorial intrusion.<br /><br />The reader is also privy to the burgeoning effects of parenting on each generation; the parents are a mirror to the offspring. Franzen's insight into what makes people tick and how he works that into each element of the story and the interlocking compartments of his characters is done with probity and humanity. The reader, for example, vividly understands the conflicting nature of Patty, because the verity and consistency of her inconsistencies has a foundation. Her flaws are not random. Additionally, the mammoth reflections and refractions between Patty, Walter, and Richard serve to enhance and heighten the tension and thrill of the narrative and events.<br /><br />There is politics, but Franzen is an equal opportunity basher to all parties. He also reserves a special deliverance with fanatics. His specific love and propriety of endangered birds and nature and conservancy in general is advanced, but it is advanced with mindfulness. He leaves his organic footprint on a message, but he is a marksman at not using platitudes to do it. He doesn't scatter diffuse homilies with ingratiating ownership; he is nuanced and wise.<br /><br />The prose is squeaky clean without ever being sterile. His witty metaphors and euphemisms are an acid delight. Pour another page for me, please. The eponymous title alone is a wealth of metonyms. And there is a moral compass, despite what some reviewers, who have not read the (entire) book, say in their non-review reviews. The compass is initially foggy, for sure, and many miles of human error and weakness and Rubicons must be crossed. The heart is irrevocable, in the story's theme. It is a mighty muscle, a feisty organ, and has two-way valves. Franzen has written a formidable, epic, and unforgettable story of contemporary times. The hype has a genuine backbone.the offspring.

0307408833|2.0|My hopes would be that the BabyCakes location in New York would do the shop justice, because the book certainly didn't! Don't be fooled by the title nor by the lovely picture on the cover. Looks can be deceiving! after purchasing the book, I bought all the necessary items needed to prepare what should have been great desserts/treats. BIG mistake there! As another reviewer  wrote, the items needed are not found in your average grocery store, which means one has to either order them online, or be lucky enough (like myself) to live in an area where the items are available. Once getting beyond that, I was ready to get started. I made the chocolate cupcakes (found on page 87), and let me say, they were such a HUGE disappointment, I threw them out! The recipe calls for garbanzo-fava flour (which I used, 1 cup of coconut oil, and 1 1/3 cups of agave nectar. this was a recipe for disaster! It all ended up tasting like beans! YUCK!! I am vegan, but if I were to serve any of these desserts to my non-vegan friends and family, they definitely would have a bad impression on vegan treats! I bought this book not only because it was vegan, but because it was gluten free and sugar free, and because of the shop itself. The book is not the best and I gave it 2 stars simply out of sympathy! The cookbook itself though will not discourage me from visiting the shop in NYC. One has to wonder too if the  chef and owner of BabyCakes had any input into this cookbook.

B00275EGWY|3.0|When I pushed PLAY, I expected to be as spellbound as others who had seen this movie and reported the drama here on Amazon. With such high expectations, the only way to go is usually south, and that's what it did.<br /><br />The acting of Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie make them first-class Thespians. They play the part of non-commissioned officers who are in the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD. It is evident that SSG James finds the adrenaline rush of outsmarting bomb makers and defusing their work. He tempts fate like the matador who moves ever closer to the horns of the bull. He removes his helmet and other life-saving equipment meant to protect him in case of a bomb blast. It looks like he is about to lose his sanity when we are exposed to a scene revealing his humanity, which I will not expound upon. It would be giving away too much of the story.<br /><br />The most effective part of the movie is his return to family life and the mundane chores expected of a husband and family man. There is no excitement in removing the leaves that are blocking the drainage trough at the roof. As an EOD expert, he had to make split-second decisions that could have cost him his life or that of his comrades, yet he looks utterly confounded by the cereals in the aisle when his wife asks him to get one. This is one thing that is not talked about when it comes to veterans returning home. Many will have experienced awesome levels of responsibility for men and materiel that cannot be duplicated in civilian life, and it can be a sudden and tremendous letdown for the ego.  How SSG James deals with this dilemma becomes obvious by the end of the film.<br /><br />If a film spends so much time trying to get into the heads of soldiers under the constant strain of combat, the rest of the surroundings should be equally realistic. This was sloppily addressed with the wrong uniforms, insignia, improper military courtesy, and lack of vehicle markings.  Leaving their posts to chase insurgents with flashlights was appallingly stupid. But what I wondered most about was this \\"autonomous team.\\"  They seemed to be more rogue than Sarah Palin, and I began to wonder if they reported to anyone or selected their missions by themselves.

0399536108|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Chris since I stumbled upon his blog post, \\"28 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Traveling.\\" Over the last two years, I've followed his travels, his advice, bought a few of his digital products and have looked up to him as a mover-and-shaker in the \\"change the world for the better\\" community.    Which is why I was so nervous when I first opened this book.    I wondered to myself, Would Chris simply reformat and regurgitate his old posts and ideas? After delivering such stellar content on his blog and through his digital products, how could he possibly captivate me further in traditional book form?    Boy was I surprised. This book is chock-full of awesomeness. If you're like me and interested in pursuing a life on your own terms, it's a must-read. Having browsed a variety of books in this niche, I can tell you that it's not a traditional \\"self help\\" book. Through interesting case studies, personal anecdotes and calculated, powerful advice, Chris shows us that we can all take life by the reins and live remarkably, helping others in the process. It's an endearing book, one that I've already started to reread and take notes. My brain can't stop churning.

I cannot imagine how anybody can be so stupid, but apparently there are still a lot of nutjobs out there.    Thank goodness for brilliant minds like Richard Dawkins.  He writes clear, convincing argument proving that evolution is a fact.    Even without all the fossil evidence we have, DNA alone is enough to prove evolution is a fact.  I am sure, however, that there will continue to be kooks who write why evolution is not a fact.  So sad.
B001UGIRF8|5.0|Genesis is arguably one of the greatest and most influencial groups of all time. It's for that reason I have almost every piece of sound they've ever recorded. It was great when they released their remastered box sets a few years ago, and I was very happy with the new mixes on these great, classic records. However, I always wished in the back of my mind that they'd release their albums on vinyl. So, naturally, I was overjoyed when I came across this product.     I've always loved vinyl. It's like holding a piece of music history in your hands. It's a common misconception that CDs and MP3s, being the newest in technology, sound far better and cleaner than an other format around. However, this isn't so. On CDs, the entire audio file is compressed and the very highs and lows are chopped off. However, on vinyl, it's all there, stretched out the way it's meant to be. And trust me, this box set is living proof of this. The  first record I ripped out was \\"Foxtrot\\" and put the needle down. The wall of organ-synthesized sound came roaring out of the speakers on \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", and blew me away. I smiled at the thought that this was just one song off of one record. I still had a lot of material to plow through.     I could go into detail about each individual album, but all I will say is just click \\"Add to Cart\\" and don't even think about it. One of the greatest eras in a great band is being released in the format the way the records were originally released first time round. Even if it's just for your own personal nostalgia's sake, just buy this product. You won't regret it.

0765326353|4.0|\\"The Way of Kings\\" is the first novel of Brandon Sanderson's \\"Stormlight Archive\\", a planned ten-book series as well as his magnum opus. Combining many traditional epic fantasy tropes with Sanderson's unique setting (as well as his talent for fast-paced execution), this novel is both a good read, and a welcome addition to the fantasy genre.     The novel is set in the fictional world of Rosher, on a continent that is frequently ravaged by brutal storm fronts called \\"highstorms\\". It centers around three primary protagonists (as well as a handful of minor characters with few chapters): Kaladin (the main character), Shallan, and Dalinar. Kaladin is a surgical-student-turned-soldier-turned-slave, who spends most of the book fighting for survival as a \\"bridgeman\\" (a near suicidal mission involving the placement of unprotected bridges under a hail of enemy arrows). Shallan is a young \\"lighteyes\\" woman (the equivalent of a noblewoman), who is carrying out a desperate heist in the guise of a scholarly apprenticeship. Dalinar is an aging lord and the late King of Alethkar's brother, who is seeking vengeance for his assassination while being wracked with visions from the past.     This book is a gigantic page-turner. Even with more than 1000 pages (long even by fantasy standards), it's an absolute breeze to read, and very difficult to put down. As is typical for Sanderson, the prose is fairly straight-forward and easy, with little ambiguity and difficulty in interpretation. It does occasionally slow down due to the frequent flashbacks, but they integrate relatively well into the narrative.     Much of the book encompasses traditional fantasy tropes executed well. Kaladin is cast into a desperate situation in which he tries to avoid despair, but there's little question that he will manage to find a way out of it. Shallan's storyline is also fairly predictable, although Sanderson throws in a bit of a twist at the end that reveals a good deal about the setting (Shallan's arc, ingeneral, is frequently used for expository purposes). The least predictable section of the story is that of Dalimar's, although he unfortunately has the least dynamic character of the three. All of this is interwoven with considerable action, lots of battles described in detail, and a good deal of magic.     What makes the book truly different are two elements: the setting, and the magic system (an odd system including \\"lashing\\", a type of gravity manipulation). Sanderson seems to be carving himself a niche in world-building with the type of naturally ravaged world he creates with Rosher - the closest comparison to it is the ash-choked world of his previous fantasy series, the \\"Mistborn\\" Trilogy. He goes into a good amount of detail describing the unique creatures and plants that have arisen in the world, including hard-shelled crustaceans on land, as well as protected, retracting plants in a world where any topsoil is simply swept away. The only weakness is in the society that Sanderson portrays, which comes across as more of your typical european-style fantasy world than the type you might expect to evolve in such a world. All of this adds to the imagery of the novel, and none of it slows the pace down (as you might expect such detail to do).     While enjoyable, \\"The Way of Kings\\" is not without its weaknesses. One of them lies in the same element discussed earlier as a strength: its predictability. After stripping away the unique world and magic, this is a very typical fantasy novel in many ways. There is little doubt that Kaladin, Dalimar, and Shallan will overcome their hardships, and while they take the reader on an interesting ride, none of them are truly unique, difficult, or memorable characters. If you're looking for such characters, this may not be the novel for you.     There are two other concerns. One is the almost-total lack of overt sexuality, either implied or shown. Sanderson does throw in a mention of a prostitute or several, and the celibacy ofthe characters makes sense in-story, but it does affect the tone and characterization in a way that makes the book occasionally feel like a \\"young adult\\" novel. The other is the use of terminology: Sanderson occasionally uses terms and descriptions that don't really seem to fit the knowledge and perception of the viewpoint character, and it would sometimes pull me out of the story.     Nonetheless, this is a solid fantasy novel, and one of the best releases of 2010. I strongly recommend it to any fantasy fans, as well as readers interested in a fast-paced, occasionally dark beginning to a new series.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I have an HD DVD player and was displeased to find that this did not play on it.  Not only that, but ONLY 3 OUT OF 4 DISCS THAT CAME WITH THIS WERE HD DVD'S, the other was a regular DVD. This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made on the internet.  I am horribly upset that Amazon dishonestly sells their products. Being that I paid for Planet Earth on HD DVD, I expected to receive a working copy COMPLETELY in the HD DVD format but apparently a simple task such as an honest customer transaction is a little to difficult for Amazon. This was from a company that qualified for Amazon's free shipping so I can safely lay the blame with Amazon. If you want this product BUY IT FROM ANOTHER WEB SITE!!!! Don't buy this here unless you wish to be ripped off. I am a regular movie customer on Amazon and really do wish to express my extreme displeasure with this drop in service quality. Unfortunately this will mark the end of my Amazon usage.
0399536108|5.0|I've been a regular reader of Chris Guillebeau's blog The Art of Non-Conformity since the very beginning, and I pre-ordered this book when it first appeared on Amazon. Honestly, I thought that his book would just be a repeat of what he'd already written for his blog, but I was pleasantly surprised to find no reused material here. Instead, what I found was a well-written, concise explanation of his ideas on living a fulfilled life presented in a format that was clearer and more accessible than anything I've seen so far.<br /><br />One of the things I liked most about this book was how he was able to express his ideas so succinctly, without making this book feel like it had been abridged. I'm not a big fan of the \\"self-help\\" genre, primarily because it seems like most authors have very simple points to make, but feel like they need to fill 300 pages up. Most authors in this genre write several hundred page books that could be reduced to a pamphlet if the repetitiveness and wordiness were cut out.<br /><br />However, this book was so well-written (and well-edited) that I'd be hard pressed to find a single page that could be cut out. The author makes his point, ensures you understand what's important about it, and move on. While all of his ideas are integrated into his overall them, he doesn't feel the need to repeat himself. Not only does this make the book a better read, it also makes it much more useful as a tool to help change your life. Instead of forgetting what the author said because the important point was surrounded by 20 pages of fluff, I found myself understanding and comprehending the message in this book because it was so simply and clearly presented.<br /><br />I've actually started implementing a couple ideas put forth in this book, and these are changes that I can stick with. Chris has got me thinking about my life and what direction I want it to go in, which I am very grateful for. If you're looking to improve your life and find out which direction to go in, then I can't recommend this book enough. It is a great place to get ideas that'll actually stay with you, and after reading it you'll be sure to be eager to start making some changes to your life and your world right away.ommend this book enough.

0553805371|4.0|This was good, but it wasn't up to Hawking's usual excellence. There was a certain unappealing arrogance to this one for one thing, and the content is kind of lacking.    He threw me when he claimed philosophy was dead, because the next book on my TBR shelf is a philosophy book, due out next month. If philosophy were dead, it would stand to reason there would be no further inquiry in the field and no working philosophers.  To my knowledge, Peter Singer is still working in the field.  To my knowledge, there are no experiments being performed to resolve the conflict between deontology and utilitarianism.  Put it back in your pants, doc, philosophy ain't dead yet.    He claims free will doesn't exist, and that's an interesting case, poorly argued.  As first evidence he asks where it showed up on the evolutionary chain. By that reasoning, I can ask where did the desire to be deceived show up? Because that is testibly real. How many people enjoy watching a magic show or a movie with good special effects? Can we point to where the joy of creation for its own sake (painting, knitting, etc) showed up? But we can't say that doesn't exist either.     In his second case he claims the ability to induce certain behaviors through electric stimulation of the brain.  That's a matter of oversimplifying.  I claim there is no such thing as The Grand Design (the book).  If you point to the cover, I'll say it's paper with ink and a gloss, not a book.  If you point to the pages, I'll say it's more paper, some glue, and some ink.  The book doesn't exist.  If you say it's the words on the page, or just the words, I'll say there is no significant difference between this and [[ASIN:0345301110 Story of O]].  If you say it's the underlying meaning contained in the specific organization of words in this case, even though no single word, page, ink mark, or bit of glue can singly be termed The Grand Design, then you would be right, and you would have pointed to what free will probably is--the underlying meaning contained in the specific organization of impulses within the brain, even though no single synapse or function can single be termed free will. This would be similar to what A-Life talks about, which is the field Conway was actually working in when he devised his Game of Life, covered in the last chapter.    He spends more time explaining why M-Theory is so wonderful than he does explaining M-Theory.  He takes a few strange, not-quite subtle pot shots at Sean Carroll's [[ASIN:0525951334 From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time]], and I'm not entirely sure why.     The Grand Design was good. It's worth the read. It's just not as good as Hawking's prior works.

B003CN5B6K|4.0|12 Episodes on 3 Discs, released on July 13, 2010<br /><br />\\"White Collar\\" is a series about a very charming con man, Neal Caffrey played by Matt Bomer, who escapes from prison with only three months to go on a four year sentence in search of his girlfriend who appeared to be in trouble last time she visited him. FBI Agent Peter Burke played by Tim DeKay who originally put him behind bars quickly finds him again. When faced with have several more years behind bars due to the escape, Caffrey offers to help Burke in his current case since he knows how to think like a white collar criminal. Begrudgingly Burke agrees and so begins their buddy-cop relationship with Caffrey on a special anklet that allows him a 2 mile radius.<br /><br />Matt Bomer has an amazing wide-eyed look about him that combined with a certain charming attitude makes him appealing to everyone and very easy to take people in, especially when taking on a role undercover. He looks like a model, thinks like Wall Street, and is very cultured when it comes to appreciating the fine arts. Since he has been released into Burke's custody, he finds a VERY swank place to live, clothes befitting his style, and finishes it all off with a fedora to emphasize how cool he is.<br /><br />Even though his character is the con man, the series really focuses on emphasizing with him and his problems aka concern over the trouble his girlfriend is going through. He wants to escape the anklet to try and find her again even though she has asked him not to.<br /><br />Girls might want to date Neal Caffrey, but Peter Burke is the character they'd want to marry. Burke is a bit of a stiff FBI Agent, but after hours he clearly cares a great deal about his wife, Elizabeth played by Tiffani Thiessen. They talk about his cases together and Neal even feels like a part of their family sometimes when he inserts himself into situations. The relationship between Caffrey and Burke goes something like this: Caffrey thinks outside the box to come up with a winning scenario to get what they need, Burke goes along with it and takes the glory when it goes well and the heat when it doesn't.<br /><br />The series is very much a case by case, episode by episode type where you could start watching any time, but what would keep you coming back would be caring about Neal Caffrey's character and storyline which a little bit is worked at in his off hours time. He pieces together clues and has to deal with the possibility of a dirty cop being in the FBI and identifying them when he is a criminal and it would be difficult for anyone to take his word. The crime is nonviolent, mostly counterfeiting, high money stakes crime told through the scope of the main duo. It is a very fun series to watch and I would recommend checking it out.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There are three short featurettes about the making of this series: \\"Pro and Con\\" about developing the character of Neal Caffrey and his casting and the dynamic he has with the character Peter Burke in their take on the buddy-cop duo; \\"A Cool Cat in a Hat\\" about the costumes; and \\"Nothing But The Truth\\" about the writing and case inspirations for episodes.<br /><br />There is a fun gag reel where Tim DeKay can't put on his jacket correctly, a bunch of deleted scenes, and audio commentary on five of the twelve episodes featuring Jeff Eastin, Tim DeKay, Tiffani Thiessen, Matt Bomer, and Willie Garson.o to get what they need, Burke goes along with it and takes the glory when it goes well and the heat when it doesn't.

0399536108|5.0|So much has been written about living a better life, a real life. And so much of it sounds like everything else.    It's all the same, just noise.    But Chris Guillebeau is different. From a relative unknown just a few years ago, it seems this young man has taken the world by storm. His style, approach, insight and ideas are so fresh and effective that nearly every pro in the business has tipped his or her hat to his ability.    From business demigod Seth Godin to best-selling author Gretchen Rubin, everyone agrees that Chris is worth listening to...if you want to live an unconventional life, that is.    I have been waiting for his ideas to be outlined in one place, so I've been eagerly awaiting this book. And it didn't disappoint. If you want to change your life--finally escape the rat race/cycle/lifeless routine--The Art of Non-Conformity will show you the way, step by step.    From setting real goals and breaking free of authority to putting your own tiny empire in place, Chris will show you exactly what he thought and did to create the life every unconventional thinker dreams of.    This is one of the best books of its kind that I've ever read. (And don't get me started on the design!)
B003EYVXSM|4.0|\\"Micmacs\\" is a French film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and is about a man and his troupe of oddballs that decide to take on two weapons manufacturers. Picture an \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" story told in a Terry Gilliam type manner with a group of misfits that live in a junkyard carrying out the mission.<br /><br />This fanciful foray of teamwork of the underdogs to take down big tobacco, I mean big arms dealers was a fun, quirky adventure to say the least. Our main character, Bazil (Dany Boon), had taken a bullet to the head that was determined to be inoperable and has to walk around with it with the knowledge that any moment he might drop head. His father was killed in a land mine accident. Each product was from one of these companies and changed the course of his life to dropping down to street performing as a profession until he is adopted by other less fortunate cast outs.<br /><br />One member of their little society is Fracasse who claimed to hold a Guinness Book world record for being a human cannon ball. La Môme Caoutchouc is a female contortionist that likes to hang out in the refrigerator as a childhood habit and becomes Bazil's love interest. Another librarian type, Calculette has a gift for numbers and statistics and can size people up upon meeting them. Petit Pierre is a shy, quiet, gifted inventor. All are gifted with a talent and take the junk found around them at the yard and try to fix it or remake it into something else until they decide to rally around Bazil's cause.<br /><br />The two tyrants are pranked around the clock with increasing intensity and are set up to believe the other person is pulling the strings until brought to a major confrontation. The journey is bizarre, the people even more so, but the goal is worthwhile and the mission impossible scenarios suspenseful to watch.<br /><br />This story is told in a very interesting visual format that places with the exposure and contrast in the picture along with using lots of physical comedy and communication. If you like Terry Gilliam 's fanciful style, check this one out too because you won't be disappointed in the array of different characters, story-telling technique, and cinematography.illiam 's fanciful style, check this one out too because you won't be disappointed in the array of different characters, story-telling technique, and cinematography.
075640407X|3.0|I'd been eagerly waiting for some free time to tuck into this first novel in the series by Patrick Rothfuss. Having read rave reviews, I was looking forward to a spellbinding read. Sadly, the first novel did not live up to expectations.  One of the pitfalls I'd likely personally fall prey to as an author would be the trap of writing a character as an ego-ideal, and thus a book that revolved entirely around one immensely perfected view of myself. Kvothe, the protagonist in the Name of the Wind, seems to be Rothfuss's own. During the first 150 or so pages it took for the book to (finally) grab me, Kvothe seems a lone, near divine character without much convincing argument as to why this is the case. When Kvothe speaks - people immediately go quiet and listen. When he admonishes - all in the room contemplate their transgressions with deep shame. However, the charisma and experience that would lead to such a compelling personality influence is lacking in his character development, hence it seems immensely contrived.   On top of this, Kvothe is, for all practical purposes, the only character in the book. Denna, his love interest, gets some development, but remains a distant secondary and minor character, regardless. In essence, the book is all about Kvothe - with absolutely no attachment developed by the reader to anyone else at all. Given that this is a chronicle of Kvothe's life, perhaps I have some sympathy here. However, as Kvothe himself is immersed in highly contrived and oddly one-sided situations, he himself isn't particularly interesting. He's led by the nose to and from pitfalls, and what he seems to need to hand in any situation seems to practically drop at his feet when or shortly before needed. Even his frustrations in life seem contrived, and you can almost always predict many of the events, good and bad, long before they occur. Suspense and a sense of real danger are sadly lacking.  Many of the same criticisms that could be launched at Paolini's Eragon could be equally cast here.  Finally, despite all the hoop-la, the magic system isn't really all that novel and new. The interactions by Kvothe at University seem almost pulled from Earthsea by Le Guin, right down to seemingly insane professors possessing the ability of speaking (true) names, and a rich, aristocratic rival. \\"Naming\\" as a magical discipline was covered quite fully previously in many books - not the least of which was Earthsea by Le Guin, Thousandfold Thought by Bakker and several role-playing games. The concept of \\"sympathy\\" was more thoroughly fleshed out in Hardy's Master of the Five Magics in the mid-1980s, where the author had five disparate magical systems to work with. In short, there's nothing really new here for people to crow about.  There's no question that Rothfuss's prose is artistic, and his words make for a tapestry that's beautiful to behold. Unfortunately, this reads like a synopsis of a role-playing session for a favorite character where things come too easy, and it makes the end result a bit more than bland to the (mind's) eye. Plot and character development are either missing entirely in some cases, or seem all too familiar to other works by other authors.
0553805371|2.0|DISCLAIMER:    YES VIRGINIA IT IS POSSIBLE, AN ANTIRELIGIONIST, ATHEIST CAN FIND THIS BOOK TO BE OBJECTIVELY VERY POOR.    SO, PLEASE ACTUALLY READ THE REVIEW BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME OF BEING A RIGHT WING NUT JOB AS MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE DONE.        Initially, I really felt the point of the book was to provide a proof from physics about how the universe came into being. Obviously this is a big task and I didn't have the highest of hopes, as it turns out the misgivings were well founded.     Upon reading the book, I still think that was the point and judged on that purpose it really did fail to satisfy.     Before I get into all the negatives I will back up one reviewer who noted he was probably at his most successful in his discussion of Feynman and the double split experiments. This was one of the best, verbal summations of the subject I have seen. He managed to integrate this well with a further discussion of the difficulties of causation, past, and future. Unfortunately the rest of the book was not so good. So, now to the BAD.                    There have been some arguments as to the point of the book and thus how it should be judged. Here are my reasons for thinking this is the purpose.     WHY do I think this was the point of the book(others disagree).     1. A discussion of the shortcomings of spiritualism in the face of science would be beating a well and truly dead horse.   2. The critique of philosophy is somewhat hit and miss aka not overly stepwise or focused.  3. The ultimate challenge to philosophy would be able to explain empirically and logically WHY SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING.              This may not be possible but I was hoping he could somehow do it.     Finally 4.NOTE; THE CONCLUSION OF THE BOOK was about the origin of the universe out of nothing. EVERYTHING LED UP TO THAT \\"POINT\\"    5. Saying anything else in the current climate serves no purpose because all the rest has been said, better mind you, by others.       That, is really the importance of the book. An argument that the universe CAN AND WOULD CREATE itself out of nothing. He basically tried to argue that in the last 3 pages(that is right 3 measly pages) and failed MASSIVELY in my opinion.    But I am the first to admit that this is probably a lacking in my own intelligence. The man is a whole heck of a lot smarter(and yes better) than me and I won't hold that against him like some people do.           WHAT IS THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE BOOK    This book is one thing and one thing only, it is a press release saying that science is not going to accept the supposed uncertainty thrust upon it by religious groups and even philosophers. Science is willing to say, and defend, the statement that IT is the only and Best means towards truth. To see this book as anything more than that is getting your hopes up, it is a nexus in the zeitgeist, a response to the din of fools who won't accept soft spoken truth and be silent. It is as if he has written a letter to the global community, throwing his support behind Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris. I applaud this, but still expected more from this book.    What this book does, is try to say that the beginning of the universe can be explained GIVEN a set of laws we have come up with. What this book does not say, is how these laws came to be and therefore says little or less about the ultimate origins of the universe. It also offers no proof for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle or plank length, a principle on which all the arguments depend. Note: this not to say they do not exist elsewhere.    To declare that God is unnecessary and philosophy is dead is important coming from a man like Hawking. It already has people talking and it adds weight to the rationalists who are having to defend science and reason against the onslaught of religious ignorance all over the world.    One might expect a devastating argument for the case of physics, but this is not what you will find. If you want a seminal proof of physics as the final explanation of the universe, you wont get that either. If you really want to understand, it is useless.    What you will get, is an inordinate amount of stated facts and unexplained claims. The easy things are overly explained and the difficulties are not addressed at all. For example, they spent pages on the anthropic principle which should be self evident given a few simple statements and basically gave no treatment of M theory whatsoever despite the fact is apparently is the theory that subsumes his premise!    The problem with Hawking is and always has been his refusal to repeat and summarize well in the course of an argument. With a brilliant audience, or in the context of a book that takes the time to bring the reader through type of proof for a concept making it self evident, this is less necessary. But in book where explanation is cursory and sometimes blatantly absent(aka its too complicated) this does not work. it is simply to hard to remember an argument or statement that is simply given and not proven in the course of the discussion. He is followable only insofar as one is able to remember his statements of fact and use logic to check the validity of his further statements. The logic checks out, but so many basic questions go completely unexamined.    It doesn't taking a reading of the entire book or even of all his books to figure this out. Simply read the last three pages of this book which seem to contain, the argument for the entire purpose of the book. Positive energy and negative energy are not even brought up until the last 3 pages yet they play a critical role. Apparently a black hole which, while being formed, approaches more negative energy than positive energy, somehow switches to positive energy and voila, this is supposed to show that the universe is balanced in terms of positive and negative energy. To me it seems like there is far more positive energy, but I am sure I am wrong.    What a hideously confusing conclusion. It should have been an entire chapter with summary.    PROSE    As for the prose itself, It is utterly dry, overly concise and without personality. The occasional attempts at humor are becoming redundant and out of place in such company. We have come to expect it in a Hawking book despite the fact it adds nothing.    Another curious aspect was the inclusion of ancients myths to introduce chapters, was this an attempt to add humanity and interest to an otherwise dull tale or was it an exceedingly subtle way of exposing the absurdity of modern religious beliefs?  It gets its 2 stars for its cultural importance.    THOUGHTS    As one who considers himself a philosopher of sorts, I think he made his point about philosophy fairly final. One cannot intuit or opine the universe, with any degree of certainty. This is because, as the experiments and discoveries he discusses show, the universe seems to function in different ways on different levels. And a model may seem to work perfectly well on one level while being false on another.    A philosopher will want one explanation and one truth, this changing of paradigm on different scales makes that impossible unless one moves through the scales through experiment and technology.    I understand it as complexity oscillating through the various scales of the universe, if not logic itself, like a supersymmetric fractal wave function. Extreme complexity can produce extreme simplicity and vica versa.    This point is given tolerably well in the discussion about the game of life near the end of the book.    The theory of mathematics does not need to hold across all universes. One could start from a set of axioms that contains contradictions and perhaps even leave them there, or this set of axioms could contain an surfeit of qualifying statements such that in the state where the contradiction would occur, it is avoided by qualification.    If M theory relies on our idea of mathematics it will not explain the rest of the universes or even possible our own. The true axioms of the universe may be infinitely more complicated or convoluted but so long as they reduce to this model.    I don't think a philosopher would be satisfied with this even though a Model dependent realist would be.     The continual reduction in our understanding of physics and the seeming shift between the predictability and simplicity on different levels seems to suggest to me that there are an infinite number of axioms with an infinite number of qualifications of those axioms that cause paradigm shifts across what is possible, again, and infinite number of levels and universes.    For all we know God could have created an infinitely convoluted and therefore unknowable universe(to keep us interested), in which our model is actually more efficient. In this case we are superior to God.

0765326353|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy author in a million -- he crafts complex, intricate fantasy worlds, and gilds them with exquisitely evocative prose. But his greatest challenge thus far has to be \\"The Way of Kings,\\" an older manuscript that he apparently dusted off, rewrote, and is now expanding into a vast fantasy epic. This is only the first book, and it's over a thousand pages long.<br /><br />It's pretty difficult to sum up the plot, since the cast is huge and aren't even in the same place. But long ago, the Radiants (sort of divine knights) once were sent by the Heralds to destroy the demonic Voidbringers. Then they turned against humanity, and begin warring over their godslaying Shardblades.<br /><br />One part of the story follows Shallan, a desperate young noblewoman who is trying to save her family from ruin. So she seeks out the heretic princess Jasnah in hopes of becoming her attendant... but of course, she has her own secret motives to restore the family fortunes.  Another follows Kaladin, a man enslaved in another land and with a shash glyph branded on his forehead.<br /><br />And then there's Szeth, the \\"assassin in white\\" who killed Jasnah's father with a Shardblade, and Dalinar Kholin, the king's Highprince brother whose visions compel him to unite his people before the unthinkable happens. The oathpact has been shattered, and disaster is coming.<br /><br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" is the sort of book that Robert Jordan should have written. The story is filled countless alien animals (they ride GIANT CRABS), mythologies, languages, magical systems and cultures, all with their own distinct quirks and characteristics. But Sanderson doesn't allow his story to be bogged down by the details -- instead he embroiders his elaborate plot with them.<br /><br />The plot itself is almost confusingly complex, but slowly gels together as the story winds on and things start to make sense. And Sanderson paints the entire story in vivid, powerful prose (\\"His dreary feelings were like a black eel, coiled inside of him\\"). The one problem: it's so long and complex that casual readers will probably crumble after the first couple of chapters. This one needs some dedication.<br /><br />And Sanderson shows his rare skill with characterization. He carefully fleshes out the main characters -- an aging warrior, a slave/soldier and a determined teenage girl -- and makes them all seem real and plausible. Kal is especially strong as a character, since Sanderson carefully develops the clash between his medical upbringing and his current job.<br /><br />And there are countless striking supporting characters -- the young prince Adolin, the prickly and ruthless princess Jasnah, clever priests, and the acrobatic assassin Szeth, who is torn by his own crimes and sins.<br /><br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" is a true epic -- grandiose, expansive, beautifully written... and only just the beginning of what is sure to be a vast, impressive series.

1400031567|5.0|Sidetracked is the fifth novel in the series of police procedurals by Swedish bestselling author Henning Mankell. The hero of this novel is Kurt Wallender. Wallender is a middle-aged, divorced, overweight and jaded policeman;he is also a brilliant and intuitive investigator of horrific serial killings in southern Sweden.<br />  Sidetracked begins with a young Dominican Republic girl who immolates herself with petrol in a rape field on a remote farm! How is this suicide linked to the series of brutal murders committed by a sadistic killer who splits the heads of his victims open with a sharp ax? Why does the killer chose rich men such as a former Justice Minister, art dealer and other movers and shakers? To reveal more details is to expose the plot which would destroy the reading experience of this excellent police procedural novel.<br />  Mankell is good in his use of dialogue to move forward the plot; tying the pieces together in a clever way which keeps readers interested in the action and the life of Kurt Wallender. Mankell also is good in exploring Swedish social and crime problems in an entertaining and literature fashion. Subjects such as sex slavery, child abuse and the increase in violent crime are also explored in this rich novel.<br />  Another star in the literary crown of Mr. Mankell!
B003HARV3Y|4.0|1 Disc Widescreen DVD, being released June 29, 2010<br /><br />\\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\" besides being a mouthful was directed by Chris Columbus with a screenplay by Craig Titley based on the novel by Rick Riordan. Riordan's books much like the Harry Potter series, have really taken off particularly with the middle school age crowd. His stories follow Percy Jackson named after Perseus who discovers he is a demi-god, son of Poseidon and that there are other demi-gods living among them. Once thrown into this new world, he is wrongfully accused of stealing Zeus' lightning bolt and has to find a way to rectify the situation to save his mother being held hostage.<br /><br />The story itself is charming and empowering much in the same style as Harry Potter. Just like Harry, Percy discovers he has powers, that there is a place he can go to train and learn more about his past and his abilities with other children like him and also like Harry, someone out there resents him and is setting him up to take a fall. For heaven's sake, Harry even has a lightning bolt scar on his face! Despite all these similar factors, the story works and is appealing, particularly to children with dyslexia like Percy has. Of course, his turns out to be a special ability to read ancient Greek so good for him.<br /><br />Percy is played by Logan Lerman whom you might remember from \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" looks like an up and coming Zac Efron with almost Elijah Wood caliber blue eyes so holds his own pretty good appearance-wise and emotionally as a lead in this series. Catherine Keener lends extra star power by playing his mother, Sally.<br /><br />His sidekick or \\"protector\\" has he prefers to be called is Grover played by Brandon T. Jackson. Grover is a Satyre whose first priority is to look out for Percy (second priority to find hot chicks). Percy's love interest is Annabeth, daughter of Athena, played by Alexandra Daddario who is very intense with a sword and even more so with her piercing blue eyes.<br /><br />More stars clocking in here are Pierce Brosnan in a too-short stay as a Centaur professor, Uma Therman as a wonderfully hypnotic Medusa, Sean Bean as Zeus, and Rosario Dawson as the very seductive Persephone, wife and hostage of Hades.<br /><br />The story is fun and exciting, not as much as the more popular Harry Potter series, but a good one for kids to jump into since Harry Potter's movie run will be ending soon and this Olympians series is just getting started. Hopefully as the characters age, the intensity will as well following the pattern set before it. I highly recommend checking it out. It's young, cute, adventure-y, and brings in all that fun Greek God mythology. Heck, I liked the Medusa in this film better than the one they came up with for the \\"Clash of the Titans\\" remake which is saying a lot since they went a different route and made her all modern here. Gotta love exciting times and mutant-like abilities!<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />In the deleted scenes, Grover takes pictures on his cell phone of one of the naked Greek statues, gives some back story on a failure in his past being a protector, dances and fights more at the Lotus casino, and Hades laments how miserable his life in hell is making a good argument for letting him have the power to overthrow his brothers which is probably why it was cut.<br /><br />There is a Powers Quiz that poses a series of statements asking you to choose how you feel about it with happy/sad/mad/indifferent faces and apparently matches you to the most likely God who would be your parent.<br /><br />\\"The Book Comes to Life\\" is a featurette where the author Rick Riordan talks about having his kids and his students read this book before he sent it off to a publisher and how the grassroots phenonmenon of popularity started for the series. Chris Columbus was attracted to the project because his daughter was listening to the book on tape and she is dyslexic just like the main character so he loved how empowering this was for kids with dyslexia to dream of being a demi-god. Of course there is a trailer in the extras too but that goes without saying.<br /><br />I did not get to review the Blu-Ray edition, but it apparently has twice as many deleted scenes and four more featurettes about Greek Gods and being on the set with Brandon T. Jackson.a demi-god. Of course there is a trailer in the extras too but that goes without saying.

0609610570|1.0|I'm not really one to write reviews, but I just wanted to help others save there money.  I bought this book on CD and thought my CD player was broken since I had to listen to the same message over and over again which was equivalent to my Nike poster I hung above my computer when I was 20 years old.  That is \\"Just Do It!\\".  The poster at least had nice design and a snappy logo, this book has neither.  I gave the book to a person I secretly despised to waste there time.
0439023483|5.0|I read a lot, but I usually steer clear of the teen category.  I am glad in this case I didn't.    This book presents you with a world that is unlike most I have ever read about.   The author is fast paced with the writing and never to wordy.  In fact to read a passage out loud to someone will really make you appreciate the prose.  So many authors want to explain their world to you in so many words that the story takes a backseat.  In this case the story never stops and the world is presented to you as the story happens and I enjoyed that very much.     As an adult I wanted to reach out to Katniss and father her.  Teach her the things the author has made obvious to the reader but she is to young to have a full grip on.  I really started to feel for these kids, the people the entire world that is under Capitol control.  That is not to say that Katniss is your typical 16 year old because her life has made her very grown up in many ways.  More grown up than even I in many areas.      I finished this book the same day I started to read it because I couldn't stop.    Give it a chance, its not to expensive and I think you'll end up picking up the other books in the series.  I am currently reading book two \\"Catching Fire\\".
B0034G4OU4|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but felt the screenplay was much too long...Julia Roberts exhibits her talented magic, as Liz Gilbert, a journalist who is spiritually and emotionally bereft. Roberts does a great job with capturing a confused, control freak, who is uncertain, generous in spirit, affable and vulnerable. Emerging from an ill matched marriage, to dating a more spiritually enlightened boy toy....Liz recognizes there is more to life and something very wrong with the men she chooses. So...with the amicable encouragement of her friends, she sets out to do something different! Viola Davis is very likeable as her BFF, a juggler supreme (super busy) life chaotically wonderful, supportive and self confident friendship. Liz makes an unexpected proposal to take a sabbatical from her normal life and journals her adventures along the way.<br /><br />The script was good, the cinematography great, and the director captured the essence of the woman and her companions. But the film was contradictory and just about 30 minutes too long. To say Liz was in an unhappy marriage bothered me...Liz was in an unhappy life (her own) and engages on an outer journey to places of inner discovery. She sets sail for Bali to find her journey's map, then on to Italy where she easily makes friends and revels in the wonders of a culture who is like a relaxed pair of jeans...you know, with the expandable waist? Liz even delivers a lecture on how unhealthy America is to women and their body image (gasp...muffin top stomachs!) She pledges to defy social mores to her newfound Swedish friend...to just \\"let go and live\\" while in the land of love and culinary delight. The problem is the camera then follows them to a boutique where they painfully, dully, try on several pairs of too tight pants, enduring the torture of having someone help them pull the zipper shut, whilst lying down for maximum flatbelly...ultimately buying another denim corset. It just doesn't compute. I guess I was hoping for more scenes of the history of Rome and more of the amazing food and drink...too much time on spaghetti (uhm, yeah, we have that here in the USA). Found myself wishing i could see the Sistine Chapel and more of the local, delights in bread, cheese, and pasta. Okay, so a letdown with the Italian sequence....the saving grace was the beautiful language and total lack of neuroses in the Italian culture,...at least within the confines of Liz's encounters.<br /><br />India was my favorite part of the story, it was humorous, capturing both the ruinous filth of the city and its collective devotion to prayer and enlightenment. Liz transcends her privileged, neurotic, monkey chatter thoughts by forming an intimate, platonic bond with another American devotee (played wonderfully by Richard Jenkins), who shares his story and prompts her (sometimes with an emotional cattle prod) to keep walking the inner path. Again though...too much time on watching someone meditate...uhm, hello? Its kind of like watching someone take a nap... not really engaging...unless you are going to throw in special effects. Our Liz was just not experiencing any significant inner plateaus during meditation, so no swirly whirly colors or visions...I would humbly suggest leaving some of this segment on the cutting floor.<br /><br />Back to Bali for the final installment, where Liz reconnects with her Yoda like shaman,\\"Ketut,\\" who gives her tasks,throwing in niblets of common sense, with an adorable toothless grin and weird accent. To give the story credit, Liz (Julia Roberts) does her best work here....in particular, a scene on the beach where she portrays abject horror at the reality of being alone with the very vulnerable, and sensitive Javier Bardem I(\\"Felipe\\")...a guarded, yet affable divorced gentleman she is growing very close to. Felipe is so diametrically different that he can easily see she is seeking a \\"champion,\\" instead of the \\"boys\\" her history involves. Liz resists, of course, in her typical New Yorky stubborness of trying to find something on the exterior to \\"fix\\" her interior flaws. Many referenced the fortune cookie ending where she runs toward discomfort, risk, uncertainty and another chance at love. This time with someone who brings out the best in her...<br /><br />All in all, i would suggest this movie as a video rental...the movie theatre involved me eating too much popcorn and milkduds, during the parts that i would have left out. Cutting 30 minutes would have been way cool. Roberts, Jenkins, Bardem....all wonderful, and its admirable when anyone, from any class (even the well heeled upper, elite) takes the path less traveled...d something on the exterior to \\"fix\\" her interior flaws.

0399536108|5.0|I have to be honest, I find a lot of these kind of books to be redundant and self referential but I have to admit, this book is QUITE different. The book is broken down into three parts:<br />1. The Remarkable Life<br />2. Reclaim Work<br />3. The Power of Convergence<br /><br />Eacg section is designed to get you to challenge assumptions, to question traditional thinking and to ask what conformity means to you. Each section also walks you through making powerful decisions about what you want to do.<br /><br />What I like most is that this book lays bare the excuses and roadblocks we set for ourself either through direct confrontation or through the stories that others who decided to live a \\"non-conforming life\\" and the fears, they and those around them have.<br /><br />The Remarkable Life - Create Your Own Rules<br />First of all, the book starts out by not trying to be a book that tells you exactly how to be or how to live. It lays out a nice framework for determinging what is important to you and encourages you to break through the barriers that have held  you back in the past. Chris gently guides you and sometimes sharply prods you through creating your own set of rules that not just work for you but that are supported by your belief system.<br /><br />Reclaim Your Work<br />In The Second Section Chris breaks down thinking about work and education. He really pushes hard on overcoming life avoidance. I think this is one of the most important sections of the book as he helps people get clear about their next steps. He also helps those who are not sure what to do figure out the very next step and then gets them to take it. This section alone will be worth the price of the book to those people who are in a career and deciding whether or not to make the jump to entrepreneurship or whether to stay and design their own job. The two most important sections are Becoming a Rockstar and Redefining Your Workplace by Hiring A Boss. The are definitely non-conformative ideas for people who decide to stay employed.<br /><br />The Power of Convergence<br />The final section of the book has you get actively involved in consciously creating your legacy. Intentionally living the life you'll remember and that those around you will remember you for. Not necessarily for the places you went and the things you did there (it's those too) but what is the mark you'll make on the world and humanity? You'll think deeply about what your legacy means and how you want it to play out. I think the big point Chris makes is tyhat you don't leave a legacy you live your legacy . . . and a whole lot of people who aren't living their legacy now will find hope and a way to develop a plan for action here.<br /><br />Whether you are trying to decide what to do with the rest of your life or just need a kick in the pants or a good idea to get restarted on your path, this book is a great, fast read that will make you happy and get you moving!of Convergence  The final section of the book has you get actively involved in consciously creating your legacy.

0446567337|5.0|DEAR JOHN by Nicholas Sparks is a novel I would read again. It may be your typical love story, but has surprising twists the reader is confronted with on the first page of the novel. However by the end of the story, I had completely forgotten about what I had initially read because I did not want it to be true. I wanted a happy ending and that is not necessarily the message Sparks is trying to convey in this story.    I laughed. I cried. I felt nearly all the emotions John and Savannah felt. That is the sign of an incredible book. The way Sparks wrote the novel engulfed me in the story to the point where I had to set out time during the day to get things done, otherwise I would have just read this book all day.    I may be a sucker for sappy love stories, but who isn't? The book still had deep insight into the purpose of relationships and how one person can change the lives of everyone around them--like Savannah did. The ending of the story can be interpreted several ways: Savannah thought she loved Tim as much as he had always loved her so she stayed married to him out of naivety, or because marriage is a commitment and she did not want to give up. No matter the reason, John is still left high and dry, only to serve his country and live without the one and only woman he ever loved.    I was able to feel the magnitude of the pain John felt when he saw Savannah for the first time wearing a wedding ring. The description in the novel is extremely vivid and eloquent. The situations in which the two are placed are realistic and allowed me to picture the settings easily.    However, because the story is told from a young man's point of view, it is obvious there are a few things that are too good to be true. The way John describes Savannah is a bit unrealistic at times. He points out details and soft images that a soldier stereotypically would not notice, so it is hard to believe he would think that way.    Another possible plot hole was the fact the two fell in love in two weeks time. Yes, that may be possible, but for them to stay together long distance through college and fighting a war in Iraq made it hard to believe their summer romance would last. I felt this way especially because they were hardly able to talk on the phone and letters were all they had to communicate. That would be hard to continue after only knowing someone for less than a month.    These two plot holes are easily ignored because of the tone of the story. It is not a novel one would read to analyze, but rather a book to enjoy on the beach or when feeling lonely. It could easily be read in a day if time permitted.     If you love Nicholas Sparks, you will love Dear John. Sparks' writing in this novel reverts back to his classic style and is sure to be enjoyed.     Oh, and one last thing: I would recommend the book over the movie any day of the week!
B002JVWRAE|4.0|22 Episodes on 4 Blu-Ray Discs, released August 31, 2010<br /><br />The vampire craze continues with this series based on the book series by L. J. Smith. It follows high school student, Elena played by Nina Dobrev who falls in love with vampire Stephen Salvatore played by Paul Wesley and ends up caught in a love triangle with him and his older brother, Damon played by Ian Somerhalder (Boone from Lost) due to a past history they have with a woman named Katherine Pierce who is the mirror image of Elena.<br /><br />When this series came out, I watched the first three episodes, got bored, and stopped. This was mainly due to the melodramatic nature of teen romance, the annoying \\"Dear Diary\\" type voiceovers, and the angst being through the roof. The series becomes much more entertaining when it stops being about who is dating who, tormented family past, and drugs and switches to an awareness about the vampires, a town history, and Elena's best friend, Bonnie (Katerina Graham) discovering she is a witch and learning to use her powers. When these secrets begin to be shared between the main cast members, the story gets a lot more interesting as unlikely pairs teams up against outside forces of vampires coming to town and a mysterious tomb buried locally that is supposed to contain Katherine herself and several other malnourished vampire souls just waiting to be released.<br /><br />Nina Dobrev's Elena is a beautiful doe-eyed innocent and actually pulls off being interesting and deep enough for a vampire to come to town just to get to know her better. She has a very highly functioning morality compass and always wants to do the right thing by her friends and family. Even more so on the scale of do-gooders is her vampire boyfriend, Stephen. Take Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and mash him together with the vegetarian Edward Cullen from the \\"Twilight\\" series and you'll get Stephen. From their combined facial features to personalities, Stephen is a tortured vampire looking for love but not wishing to sacrifice his woman's happiness from head to toe. Occasionally Stephen or Elena will inform the other the painful truth that they shouldn't be together for the well-being of the other but are unable to stay apart for long.<br /><br />While other towns may boast of a \\"rich\\" town history, this town seems to make good on that. Townspeople have been secretly gathering information about vampires for years and the lady sheriff of the town seems to be the head of the offensive force when they suspect vampires have come back to town. Stephen's brother, Damon seems to still carry a torch for Katherine, the woman they both fought over years ago and wishes to free her, but also engages himself regularly in trying to thwart the police for their mutual safety and cover.<br /><br />This series is pretty entertaining when it doesn't dwell on high school problems of dating and focuses on the creatures of the night. I would mostly recommend it for teenagers through the 30's crowd and particularly enjoy Ian Somerhalder's presence after his turn on Lost being so short. Here he almost plays the Sawyer character as a vampire since he helps out for his brother and Elena, but is often the antagonist as well and always is playing for his own best interests.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />It looks spectacular on Blu-ray, especially during vampire/witch special effects. There are over 8 hours of special features including four featurettes, unaired scenes, and a gag reel. Some of the Featurettes include: \\"Into Mystic Falls: Bringing Vampire Lore and the High School Experience from Page to Screen\\", \\"When Vampires Don't Suck!: The Popularity of Vampires and the Fans Who Love Them\\", \\"The Vampire Diaries: A New Breed of Vampires - Casting the Series\\", and \\"The Vampire Diaries: Vampires 101 - The Rules of the Vampire.\\" There is commentary from the creators and director on the Pilot episode and a well-advised spoiler alert that you should watch the whole season before listening and stuff is given away! There is also \\"The Vampire Diaries: A Darker Truth Webisodes\\" and the most unique aspect about getting the Blu-Ray version would be the Downloadable Audiobook of the Bestselling Novel The Vampire Diaries: The Awakening by L.J. Smith. What a great way to break new people into the source material!he Vampire Diaries: A Darker Truth Webisodes\\" and the most unique aspect about getting the Blu-Ray version would be the Downloadable Audiobook of the Bestselling Novel The Vampire Diaries: The Awakening by L.J.

1416550550|5.0|I loved this book. A woman goes in search of her grandmother's history and finds her own. At the age of 4 Nell is left on a ship by a woman that lives in a cottage on her parents estate. She ends up in Australia and is adopted by one of the ships crew and his wife. There is a fairy tale element in this story and some dark places to explore as well. I love how Kate Morton wove this story together. I love how the mystery unfolds. Curl up on a rainy day and read this book. Enjoy!

B001HN6940|2.0|Ok, so here it is the review that I thought I would never have to write, but you made me do it Mr. Burton. I have had some share of bad times with you at the theaters, with Ed Wood, Planet of the Apes, and the uproarious bomb...Mars Attacks! But never did I think that with Disney holding your goth inspired hand throughout the process that you would miss the mark completely. I only found 2 interesting things regarding your latest romp through another crazy place (i.e. Willy Wonka's Factory) First off where the visuals. Amazing scenes filled the screen with true to life representations of Lewis Carrolls' literary classic. You felt as if you where actually in Wonderland for seconds. (But only for seconds.) Secondly was Johnny Depps' portrayal of the great mad hatter. He did hit the nail on the (crazy) head. Nothing did delight me more to see him let loose again as an actor. And I appreciated the attempt at bringing in some one a little new to the filming process, but honestly you could of used a much better Alice, in fact, Anne Hataway would of faired MUCH better as Alice than the White Queen...role reversals...I do wish I would of gotten to see this flop on the 3D screens, but unfortunately thats what you have to deal with when living in a small town in Oregon. I heard the film was far superior in eye-popping 3D, than in traditional 2D. Maybe next time Tim!!!
0439023513|1.0|this book was a serious disappointment, it didn't even feel like it belonged with the other books.  i had such high expectations after the other two, but this one left me depressed and wishing i hadn't read it.
B002ZG97RE|2.0|\\"The Green Zone\\" was directed by Paul Greengrass and written by Brian Helgeland based on the book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran. Greengrass also directed the last two films in the Bourne series so here he joins up with Matt Damon again to tell the story of Roy Miller, Chief Warrant Officer for the U.S. army gone rogue to uncover the truth behind faulty intelligence in an unstable region before it turns into a war. It follows specifically the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and casts non-actors but actually experienced ex-Marines and Rangers as army soldiers.<br /><br />Matt Damon as a soldier is very believable. Let's face it, he's just so darn all-American in appearance and sincerity, I'd take his orders anytime. He leads the cast well and gives the movie merit just by his participation which is top notch as always. But even those blue eyes can't will this movie to explosive heights.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear plays Clark Poundstone, a high up government guy supplying the information that sends Miller's men out on the charge to find these weapons and every raid turns up empty-handed. Lawrie Dayne played by Amy Ryan is a reporter trying to track down the source of the information who is code-named Magellan.<br /><br />The story at first seems timely, but it isn't anything new. We've lived this story for years and I think people want to move on. This film was pushed back several times for some reason and as a result, was released in a time where the climate of the masses no longer cares about Iraq having or not having weapons of mass destruction so it has a slightly out-dated feel. Seeing President Bush onscreen giving that victory speech to the soldiers that the war was over feels like old news since it never changed anything. The only real message to take home from this film is how the Iraqi people are not all bad and want this struggle to be over just as much as us Americans back home do, but they want to do it on their terms and not be managed by the USA anymore like children.<br /><br />There is a constant shaky cam going on during all battle sequences and while it is supposed to be more realistic and frightening, it is more likely to induce a headache or stomachache. The choice must have seemed valid at the time, but running around shaking the camera on purpose just makes it almost unwatchable in parts. What Greengrass did so well in the Bourne movies to create excitement in a one-man versus everyone sense seems really overboard in a war setting.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />Inside the Green Zone talks about the actual MET (Mobile Exploration Teams) that were charged with finding weapons of mass destruction and the intel packages being received were not matching what was on the ground. The cast raves about Greengrass's ability to create absolute chaos for excitement. The teams' attention to detail in trying to recreate circumstances in Baghdad as close as possible to the real thing is admirable. They come right out and admit that they wanted to make a big-budget popcorn movie for big audiences as well as raising questions and provoking audiences to ask, \\"Now what?\\" to their government representatives.<br /><br />Matt Damon: Ready for Action is a featurette about how dedicated Matt Damon was to being a good commanding officer for the actual army guys in the cast taking his orders. He honored accuracy and based his character off a real person whose story this was based on.<br /><br />There is feature-length commentary with Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass as well as optional commentary for all the deleted scenes. The actor and director have worked together closely on other projects before so there is a camaraderie in how they get along on and off set. Matt Damon jokes that this is one of the first projects with Greengrass where he actually had to look more closely at the script. Great care was taken in accuracy and the big budget action sequences and both feel that this was a timely released film. There are many deleted scenes that give a little more exposition, but are mostly dull overall.all.
0790705141|5.0|If you watch the film about the Amityville Horror , { the one that has James Brolin and Margot Kidder in it },   someone copied someone here.  The Amityville film says \\"1979\\", and yet not sure when \\"The Shining\\" was written, but it is too much like Amityville or vice versa.  Down to blood oozing from the walls, {well, in The Shining it crashed out of the elevator}, to a dead child telling a living child they wanted them to stay there with them \\"forever and ever\\". And the dad was slowly going psycho with an ax.  Who copied who ?
0393072231|4.0|I have read and reviewed a number of Michael Lewis' books, \\"Moneyball\\" being the best to date in my view.  While this may not be not be his best book, I cannot imagine that many investigative authors can approach Lewis' tenacity and attention to detail (only Dan Brown comes to mind), and the author's skills are in keen display in \\"The Big Short\\".    Perhaps it is because the subject matter was so complicated, but I had difficulty following all the confusing page-after-page details.  However, the big picture seemed clear - Wall Street managers devised a scheme to essentially sell billions of dollars of bundled mortgage bond products that consisted of a house of financially hopeless cards yet presented as triple A, no-risk investments.  Investors, even presumably sophisticated investors, did not sufficiently understand the nature of the contents of these bond portfolios, nor apparently had the intellectual curiosity to find out.  Instead the process and problem continued, and festered below the radar screen due to the greed and associated bonus payouts to the Wall Street smart guys.      Ultimately it was left to a small group of unaligned individuals who inherently understood that what Goldman Sachs et als were selling was not worth buying.  (NB, in this instance, there is a distinct and indirect connection to Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Blink\\", particularly his chapter on \\"the adaptive unconscious\\").  The stories of these contrarians is what \\"The Big Short\\" is mainly about - how they came to the conclusion that greed and debt were destroying the Nation's financial system, then began the process of selling short the bogus bundled bonds etc.  And, their analysis proved to be correct - unqualified homeowners began defaulting on their loans, corrupting the bonds and causing the entire financial system to collapse.  The stories of these few geniuses, and their not so glorious aftermaths, are brilliantly delivered by the author.    However, not so brilliantly developed, in fact,not delivered at all, was the cause and effect of the political manoeverings behind the Government's affirmative action practice of ensuring that loans be made to people obviously unable to repay them - backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (e.g., the taxpayers).  There is no political finger pointing here, which is a clear disappointment, and major flaw to \\"The Big Short.\\"   It's lack of explanation weakens the overall story.  For instance, how long did it take for this government mortgage-for-all bullying process to unwind?  What were the roles of Clinton, Bush, Frank and Dodd, or others?  Did they actively conspire with the Wall Street Executives to create this foreseeable nightmare.  And, what about Greenspan and the Fed, how did they contribute to, or even cause, the financial failure?  And, what about the SEC or other regulators?  Why were a few smart people able to see the impending doom while they turned their heads?    As I noted, this book has so many details that it is difficult to understand at the detail level.  However, the big picture is pretty clear. This is a highly recommended book with the exception noted.
B003X73QA8|5.0|Downloaded it the day of release for four bucks. Fantastic album and I would have happily paid much more.
0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key deals with a shocking part of French history and the Holicost.  The french police were responsible for rounding up Jews and sending them to the camps.  It is a part of history that I did not know anything about and this novel deals with it in a facinating manner.  I really could not put it down.
B003L16FAE|5.0|Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition<br />Blu-Ray, released on June 29, 2010<br /><br />\\"Predator\\" is an iconic movie that started a series that led to another series of \\"Alien vs Predator.\\" This first film was directed by John McTiernan and written by Jim and John Thomas and originally was released in 1987 and is getting the Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-Ray treatment in 2010. The story is of a team of commandos with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on a mission in Central America that are hunted by a highly advanced alpha alien.<br /><br />Some of the other rough, tough muscle men of the time in this commando unit are Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, and Richard Chaves. The Predator himself was played by 7 foot tall Kevin Peter Hall. Over the course of the film, the men are hunted down one by one while they try to deal with a woman along for the ride named Anna played by Elpidia Carrillo. Eventually Arnold goes man to man with the Predator in an epic scene full of explosions, water, and mud.<br /><br />This film really set the scene for a genre that mixed sci-fi, action, and horror in a new way. No doubt the Predator itself was freaky and scary, but there's the manly man element of fighting back with big battle sequences and the fact that the Predator is extraterrestrial to make it more interesting. It is a memorable film that still gets fans to buy memorabilia and t-shirts to this day and I bet they can't wait for the newest film, \\"Predators\\" to open.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is just crammed FULL of features. Here's a bit of a run down.<br /><br />First off, you can listen to commentary from director John McTiernan who provides quite a bit of insight into difficulties they had in production with too much jungle, not enough jungle, red suit dilemmas, and designing the predator. Also there is a text commentary which appears along the bottom of the screen like subtitles from Film Historican Eric Lichtenfield. It reads like the man would speak, not a pop-up video format. You can set it up to actually listen to the director and read the historian at the same time if you wanted to, but it's very confusing.<br /><br />There are multiple detailed making-of features and featurettes starting with the \\"Predator: Evolution of a Species - Hunters of Extreme Perfection\\" feature that goes through the first two movies and the creation of a script written with a part for Arnold taking Predator back to the jungle on another planet that got sidelined when it was decided to go into an Aliens versus Predators format instead. The understanding is that the new movie coming out, \\"Predators\\" is a manifestation of that script without the Governator. Another feature is \\"If it bleeds, we can kill it: The Making of Predator\\" which was clearly put together from interviews taken at the time of the filming and not current day reflection like the other. It tells of fun anecdotes competitive gym time and Jesse Ventura and Arnold measuring the circumference of their biseps. The \\"Inside the Predator\\" featurettes break down specific elements even more as well as certain \\"Special Effects\\" like \\"Red Suit Staring Down\\" and other scenes.<br /><br />There are several deleted scenes & outtakes, Short Takes with the Filmmakers, and an entire photo gallery and Predator Profile. Finally, there is also a sneak peek of the new film, \\"Predators\\" seeing some background footage and explanation of the premise.<br /><br />Basically, if you love \\"Predator\\", everything you ever needed to know about the movie or the making of it is in this Blu-Ray and it looks fantastic when you watch it.set it up to actually listen to the director and read the historian at the same time if you wanted to, but it's very confusing.

1439181780|5.0|When I was in seventh grade, I made my first \\"vision board.\\" Of course, that was many, many years ago. Back then, I called it (among other things)  my \\"dream poster.\\" I cut up magazines and newspapers and did drawings of things I wanted to do and places I wanted to see. I also wrote in notebooks with different colored pencils a \\"diary\\" of all the things I had achieved in life -- before any of it could have actually happened. I focused on my desires. I read biographies and novels and watched movies about people who did what I wanted to do. I worked on making my dreams come true. I got into the schools I dreamed about. I owned a business -- back when the \\"glass ceiling\\" in business was proudly made out of solid cement! I took a trip to Europe, and got a newspaper to foot the bill for all the expenses. I danced professionally. Yep, I was on the stage at Lincoln Center once! Later on, I got yet another job of my dreams.<br /><br />And, I did this while lots of people spun their wheels in the background telling me what a fool I was, that I should give up -- over and over and over again. I've faced ridiculous obstacles, and conquered them every time.<br /><br />So, I guess I discovered \\"The Secret\\" before Rhonda Byrne made it popular. But, even Rhonda Byrne admits that it is not her invention at all! Dream. Focus on those dreams. Keep going, even when reality and so-called realists tell you that you are wasting your time.<br /><br />I laugh when I read the one-star reviews for The Secret and The Power. Sooo many people have the answer, they think. It's just that their answer is always \\"no.\\" No, you can't have more money. No, you can't have that career. No, you can't get into that college. No, you can't dance, can't sing, can't paint, can't..... anything. And, for them, people who keep moving on are stupid, because we can't see it their way.<br /><br />Enjoy your negativity, folks. I can't imagine what I might achieve next. But, I assure you it won't be sitting on my rump insulting others who dare to dream, and dare to achieve.<br /><br />The Power, by Rhonda Byrne is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it to anyone capable of thinking outside of narrow limitations.dream, and dare to achieve.

B00319KS7C|3.0|If you are at all interested in the story behind the movie listen to the production of it by \\"This American Life\\" much more engrossing. I listened to that on the radio first and was excited to see that they had made it into a movie... not worth the price of admission.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Long time fan of Ray here too. I'm glad he doesn't stay with the same pattern even when it was successful in the past. He's been touring with this band for about five years and I love the sound they are producing together. Ray uses a nice mix of story telling, beautiful music, and passion in his vocals that many of us appreciate. God Willing is a clever letter home by a cowboy on the trail to his girlfriend. Beg, Steal, or Borrow is a lively tune telling a young man to go out and find his own way in the world. And my favorite is a nicely written and sung story of an older man describing life's hard journey and how he now sees what it's truly all about. This has more banjo and steel guitar that most of us non-country music folks are use to, but Ray makes it work for me and I feel there is not a bad song on the album. Really a great CD. It made the \\"it moves my soul\\" rating, for me anyhow. :)
B001TH8UUA|4.0|I've been using this item for couple of months and it works just fine, and its quality is pretty good. The wire is a little bit hard though that is not recommendable for tight loops and corners.  It is a great value for money comparing to other brands.
B00275EGX8|1.0|sorry folks, who believe this movie was worth winning the academy award! I have friends that have served and they didn't feel this movie served justice to those in the military. OK not real...how about pure entertainment...kaka, watch saving private Ryan. The hurt locker turned me into the hurt looker. I was bored and the acting was sub-par. They should have given the Academy award to her husband for Avatar it was definitely more entertaining then this crap.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Viewing \\"Starfighter\\", clearly and vividly presented in Blu-ray, is like returning to the days of technological yesteryear. With gaming imagery and visual special effects reminiscent of Pac-man and the first \\"Star Wars\\", the story features a fresh-faced and beguiling main character, Alex, played by the big-haired but charming Lance Guest and 2 extrastellar characters inhabited by veteran character actors Dan O'Herlihy as Alex's reptilian sidekick and Robert Preston as an intergalactic hustler(The Music Man in outerspace).  Set at the intersection of fantasy and reality, \\"Starfighter\\" could very well have veered into the pretentious, pondering existential questions such as \\"Who am I?\\" \\"What am I doing here?\\" \\"What are my responsibilities to myself and others?\\" Instead, it functions as a refreshingly uncynical boy's adventure film and a worthy modestly budgeted companion to the high profile \\"E.T.\\" \\"Back to the Future\\" and \\"Big\\", with which it shares many characteristics.
030726999X|5.0|Great series beginning to end.  I loved each book individually but this one was by far my favorite.  It picks up immediatly after the last book ends and it dives right into the action, where as the first 2 books seemed to take a while longer to get going.  This book follows multiple investigations of the same crime from all the different sides simutaneously.  Constantly going back and forth from all the points of view.  Which can sometimes be confusing but I felt it was done really well.  I hated Dr Teleboria just as much as Lisbeth and I absoultely loved the scene in court when he finally gets whats coming to him!  Great stuff.<br /><br />The ending was only ok in my book... but maybe thats because I would rather the story didn't end  :)  I just felt that most of the action finished up a few chapters before the ending... so those last few pages just seemd to drag on for me.<br /><br />There are rumors that Stieg's live in girlfreind is still writting the 4th and final book... not sure how much truth their is to that, but I really hope it is true.  Only thing is, unlike the other 2 books, I didn't feel like much was left unresolved for a 4th story to continue on.  The only thing that was never explained... and I would love to know more about was Lisbeth's twin sister.  If a 4th book ever does coem out I hope to finally meet the mysterious twin.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I have waited for this since the end of the show. This collection comes with extra materal that relates to different seasons. The first thing you will notice is that there is a lot of packaging to get through. The disks are packaged in a way that prevents sratching. This is certainlly better than a previous serious collection I ordered of Stargate Atlantis.    I do recommend this if you are a fan of Lost. Also if you want to catch up on episodes that you missed, this is great for that and with a all the extra bonus material.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|This film suffers from a cheesy script, absurd situations and a somewhat campy feel (more so than other \\"Treks\\"). Does this make the film bad? Sure the Klingons look like Glam-Rock rejects and Sybok was not a fully developed character (nor would he have been if Sean Connery played him) despite him being Spock's half-brother. This Trek film is a conglomeration of other Trek cliches' all rolled up into one. Blame Harve Bennett or blame William Shatner. Heck, blame Paramount for even allowing the film to be made. But for all of these flaws and any \\"blame\\" one may want to assign, it is vitally important, as a TOS Star Trek fan, to understand what this film is really about; The relationships of the seven main characters based off of a lifelong professional career and friendship (much like the actual actors themselves). More importantly it is about the original Star Trek triumvirate's relationship with each other. The mutual love, respect and whatever other adjective may apply, built over decades of adventuring, working, living and dying with each other (or, more precisely; the actors similar, if not so serious yet real, relationships through the years).    The film is not without its shining moments; The entire scene with Sybok attempting to put the whammy on(Okay, help) McCoy, Spock and Kirk and the questioning Sybok's idea of god, to name a couple.    As bad as the film is it shines in these areas, despite the aforementioned script, situations and camp. As a fan, I feel it defines the same characters and their relationships making previous and post films (regarding these characters specifically) feel more complete because of it. In the end, is this such a bad thing?
0743289692|5.0|A compelling book - reads like a novel although it is autobiographical.  It emphasized what a harsh existance women undergo in the fundamentalist Muslim world and due to lack of education do not understand that their lives could be made better and less oppressive.  She stands out as an example of what can happen when a woman deviates from the norm and is exposed to other cultures and free thinking individuals whereby a woman can be free and independent to follow her own course.  It also shows that to deviate from such an oppressive situation one also can put oneself in a precarious and dangerous position whereby seeking freedom does not always mean freedom from retribution.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Over the years I have heard of many groups but this one really had a significant impact on me. Truly remarkable voices. Exceptionally outstanding tracks/songs are Lisa Kelly's Send Me A Song, The Soft Goodbye and Chloe's Someday ! Highly Recommended.
0439023483|5.0|Recommended by one of my favorite authors, I was hoping it would as good as she says it was - IT WAS EVEN BETTER!! I am so glad I read this at a time when the following 2 books were available. I burned through Hunger Games in 1 day - it was that good. It's very rare, at least for me, to have a book move me, the story staying with me way after I've read the last page. There was a little bit of everything - mystery/suspense, a love story, politics, action and humor in just the right places. The setting is on the dark side, but fitting for the futuristic storyline. I love how the plot was constantly moving and changed just when I thought it wouldn't - kept me on my toes and glued to story. I dove right into book #2.    I would highly recommend this book!!
B0030L2BWG|5.0|Cashore has created a dark, fancinating world. People born with grace - magical gifts - are feared, prized, valued, and always enslaved. Watching the main characters dance and weave their way through dangerous, complicated plots was the most fun I've had reading a book in a long time. Don't miss this one!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I first heard Gravity on Last.fm, and I couldn't stop listening to it! This whole album is so stunning, I'm speechless!<br /><br />I listened through the whole album through, and was like, \\"this is not bad, but not my favourite\\". Boy did this album grow on me! I listened to it a couple more times, and then was like, \\"my gosh! it's terrific!\\". Listened to it another couple times, and it became my all-time favourite CD!<br /><br />Every single song on this album is a masterpiece. There isn't one bad song. I sing my heart out with these, I get chills, I laugh, I cry, it moves me Bob. It's just... Amazing!!!<br /><br />1) Love Song. This song is a new classic. I love the piano pounding out those awesome chords! Amazing lyrics. It really shows the difficulty of being in the music industry, and what the record labels demand. The music video is brilliant, too! You must read the story behind this song. It's hysterical!<br /><br />2) Vegas. Another great one. This probably gets a 4.5 from me, but it's still great. Catchy tune.<br /><br />3) Bottle It Up. This one is super catchy, and her voice sounds awesome in it! I love to play this one on the piano. Her run-on sentences throughout her songs give them a great dynamic.<br /><br />4) One Sweet Love. This one has a nice bright, happier sound to it, and a slightly different style. One of the lines sounds like one from Sarah McLachlan. A great song.<br /><br />5) Come Round Soon. One of my faves on the album! I love the first line: \\"I could use another cigarette. But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet.\\" This song is a gem. Her lyrical power is divine. This song makes me get mad at the guy, makes me feel her despair, and everything. It's chilling.<br /><br />6) Morningside. A great up-beat song that is a bit of fresh air after the emotional, depressing \\"Come Round Soon\\". It kinda makes you jump up and start dancing :D<br /><br />7) Between The Lines. What can I say? I love it! I get chills every time I listen to it. Another one of my favourites to play on the piano.<br /><br />8) Love On The Rocks. A nice contrast to the slower \\"Between The Lines\\". It make me want a drink ;)<br /><br />9) City. OMYGOSH!!!!! This one is my favourite, but then again all her songs are terrific, so I don't have favourites! This reminds me of \\"Piano Man\\" by Billy Joel, but this one's more emotional. \\"Piano Man\\" is just plain depressing, but this song really makes you feel the emptiness and loneliness of what she goes through. Another one of my favourites to play on the piano. It's just a masterpiece!<br /><br />10) Many The Miles. This is a nice up-beat, happy contrast to \\"City\\", but for some reason it's not one of my favourites. It's a great song, nonetheless.<br /><br />11) Fairytale. I LOL every time I hear this song! Brilliant piano, great vocals. She truly has an angelic voice! This song is so fun and up-beat. I love playing this one on the piano (although quite difficult to play just right).<br /><br />12) Gravity. The all-amazing, forever-lasting Gravity. I get chills just thinking about the song! The title fits the song just right, but I don't think she says \\"gravity\\" once in the song. The lyrics are inspired. It's as if she's singing a piece of her heart.<br /><br />This album will always be on my iPod. It's a true work of art. I have a digital version, but I'll buy a hard copy soon, which means a lot since I don't have hard copies. Now as soon as I have money I'm going to buy Kaleidoscope Heart!!!A nice contrast to the slower \\"Between The Lines\\". It make me want a drink ;)    9) City. OMYGOSH!!!!!

B003FXXNH6|5.0|This video is worth the money. If you love Undisputed and Undisputed 2, you will love Undisputed 3!  The only to find out, is to see it for yourself. Even if you don't purchase it here, or decided to go to the video store, this is a very good movie!
0439023491|5.0|After finishing Hunger Games, I couldn't wait to start Catching Fire - Collins does not disappoint!! I wasn't sure where the story was going after book #1, but where it went surely surprised me - I was SHOCKED! I only fell more in love with the characters (even the surly ones!), and it broke my heart to find out the twist to the Quarter Quell Games - UNBELIEVABLE!! It was interesting to meet the new characters, and the interaction between them was differenct from those in the first book.  Collins had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through, and the ending was once again a cliff hanger - glad I had book #3 on hand:-)
B001QWBM62|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers, this little recorder packs a jumbo sized punch. I have used it to record video soundtrack with my Canon HV30 by plugging the H4n line-out  into the HV30 mic-input using a 1/8\\" connector. The quality of the captured audio is at least 100 times better than the  HV30s built in microphones; fantastic. The stereo image/depth/quality with birdsong...gurgling streams, footsteps etc etc is astounding, a revelation coming from on camera mics.<br />  Importantly, Do NOT record soundtrack with the H4n AUTO mode turned on; its important to set the levels manually (65%-75% works great for most stuff), and then keep an eye on the levels. I use slight compression on the incoming signal to tame peaks. If you use AUTO mode, and start recording in near silence (often the case), the recorder sets the pre-amp gain to 100% and you get a hissy signal. Even dialing this back to 90% would give you much much better signal, but 100% just sucks. Go Manual.<br />Plus all the other XLR connectors, 4 track recorder stuff, tuner, metronome works just great too. Like everyone says.<br /><br />The main thing I want to say is Zoom Customer Support is GOOD! One of the reasons I bought the H4n was to use it as a Audio Interface/SoundCard with my Laptop for recording/music production while traveling. Imagine my surprise  when I all I got was crackling and dropouts on windows 7 64 bit (I was bummed). BUT after 3 or 4 emails with Zoom Customer support, we had solved the problem (turned off the wireless card) and audio quality over the USB connection is excellent. The H4n driver co-exists happily with MOTU firewire drivers, and works great with Ableton, Sonar, Cubase, Vegas Pro.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I cannot for the life of me remember where I first saw this movie, it might have been at school. But I do know that it struck me so powerfully, it's been one of my favorite movies since. It carries a beautiful message of love and faith and not a single person who watches it in it's entirety can ever not love it.

B003L77TZI|1.0|I'm surprised and very disappointed that Katy Perry appears to have lost her rock edge.  This is a phoned in, desperate for a hit album.  It's something you'd expect from Ke$ha or Miley Cyrus, not from an adult woman on the verge of getting married.  I expected more from Katy Perry.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|although this was the second \\"Jesse Stone\\" film released, in the story-line this is the 1st entry in the series, since it is the prequel to the first release, \\"Stone Cold\\".<br /><br />this installment shows the viewer how Stone became police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts.  Formerly, he was a homicide detective working for the L.A.P.D. He was kicked off that job due to his alcoholism, drinking on the job.  He is estranged from his wife.<br /><br />A new chapter in his life opens when he gets a chance to interview for the now open position of police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts, a small fishing village.<br /><br />To his surprise, he gets the job.  A few days later, he learns that the former police chief has recently died, of an apparent suicide.  The case seems to be \\"open and shut\\", but Stone has his doubts.
1423121708|5.0|Percy Jackson is in 6th grade and in his 6th boarding school, in 6 years. He has been suspended from every school he has ever attended. Strange things seem to happen to him, monsters following him where ever he goes. Still, it isn't easy since he has ADHD and dyslexia. So when his Pre Algebra teacher turns into a mythical teacher and tries to kill him, he thinks he's having another hallucinations. But when his crippled friend Grover turns into a satyr, his history teacher becomes a legendary demigod instructor, and he discovers his long lost dad is a god, he knows something strange and dangerous is about to happen.    This book was the best book I had read since Harry Potter. I wish there were 6 stars to rate it with instead of just five.
B001FB55I0|3.0|This is a better than average action film, but compared to earlier 3, it has little emotional pitch and the themes - of fate, heroism, and evolution - are not advanced at all - you get no idea that time lines are converging in spite of tampering with time travel devices and actions, the characters are rather set and do nothing unexpected, and Conor is, well, just kind of superhuman as the robots bounces him off walls, etc.  Still, it is fun and the images are quite good at times.  The acting is very strong with Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington.  Oddly, Conor's wife, who Danes so superlatively acted in T3, is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done.<br /><br />Interestingly, I bought this as blu-ray, and I can't say that the picture, with the exception of a few images, is more than marginally better.  There is no unmistakable, quantum improvement over dvds.<br /><br />REcommended. It is worth owning if you like to dissect the nuances of the series.  I'd give this 3.5 stars.
B003KT3NRA|5.0|i think it's a great album!! the last 2 songs are great cover songs! love it and can't wait to get it!!!!
0786122188|5.0|Previous to reading this book I had listened to the Fineman lectures on physics, but I didn't fully understand the dynamic personality of this character until I read this book. It is a compilation of stories about Richard Fineman's life, and I enjoyed them very much. These stories range from his time spent in Los Alimos working on the bomb, to playing in a samba band in Brazil, to winning the Nobel prize, to picking up on women in bars, to his artistic forays, to his decision to stay at Cal Tech despite what other school offered to pay him. The book was funny, engaging and read very well by a talented narrator. I look forward to reading more about this charismatic character in [[ASIN:0393320928 What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character]]
B000002UA0|5.0|I have owned a copy of the album (vinyl, on Tower Records) since the mid-1970s, when I asked for it to be brought to Wonderland, a record store in Newark, Delaware. Being a Floyd fan already I loved the sound, imagining it to be what the band sounded like early on.  And of course, you get to hear Syd in pretty good form.  I won't go through each song as others have.  I like all of them, although they do not really hang together well.  Most of the songs cannot be heard elsewhere.  The problem is that THIS IS NOT REALLY WHAT THE BAND SOUNDED LIKE BACK IN THE 1960s. The band members and others that saw the group live have commented on this fact; the Floyd were a live band and this is a studio album which did not capture the live sound. If you want to know what they were like live I would suggest the DVD of (roughly the title) 'Let's Make Love Tonight in London.' As a studio mix of early stuff I would also suggest 'Relics' which includes Arnold Layne. 'Ummagumma' also has one live album containing Astronomy Domine.
B0012FHPXW|5.0|I was never a fan of Nightwish until Dark Passion Play. I find Anette to be much more versatile and dynamic than Tarja. The older Nightwish music was nice to play in lieu of classical music (IE ...as background music). DPP is the first Nightwish album that I consider to be able to stand alone and set Nightwish apart from other artists of the genre, such as Within Temptation, Krypteria, Delain, etc...
0140120416|5.0|This book is excellent.  I have bought many other books and this one by far has been the best one I've purchased hands down.  This book has alot of examples, exercises and is really easy to work with, easy to understand.  I have learned alot from this book as well.  I totally recommend this book.
0765326353|2.0|So far, everything Sanderson has put out I have thought was fantastic. Even Warbreaker.<br /><br />That being said, this book was overhyped and it failed to capture me.<br /><br />At over 1000 pages, Sanderson needed to make me care about the characters, the world, the plot. I didn't actually start getting into the book until after the 500page mark. If this had been another author, I wouldn't have finished the book.<br /><br />Thankfully, I did finish it. That being said, it was only from the 800page mark and on that I actually got excited about the story. I know this is supposed to be a 10book series and hence the first book is going to be a huge \\"world setting up\\", but the reader still needs to be drawn in and captivated.<br /><br />Given how this was written, I will probably wait until 3 or 4 books are out before reading any more. Nothing in this first novel really made me want to read 10books worth of it.<br /><br />I am sad. Because like I said at the beginning, I have LOVED what Sanderson has written so far. Maybe a re-read in 5 or 6 years will change my perspective; I sure hope so
B0015DROBO|5.0|It took me a few chapters to really get into this book. Also, the Swedish city names take some getting used to. Overall, I would highly recommend this book. It lives up to the hype.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is some knife! I haven't had the opportunity to take this one out yet but look forward to it in the near future. It was delivered promptly with no delays. For anyone considering a purchase - this knife has some significant weight to it (1/4 inch of steel is not going to be light) I'm sure this knife will have no problems addressing any tasks put before it. Not crazy about the nylon portion of the sheath but this can be modified at a later date.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is a show that came on the heels of Fox usual brilliant decision - just after he canceled my beloved Dark Angel. At first I thought this show would be terrible, but I sat and watched - and it was love. Really. It is rare to find a show that can be taken seriously that also made me laugh out loud every episode. The writing was extraordinary, and the actors / actresses have been absolute gold. It was like watching a movie every time.

1416589473|5.0|I have been a big fan of the Guild Wars games since their release and am greatly anticipating the release of Guild Wars 2. This book bridges the gap between the two games. It is a definite must read for any Guild Wars fan that enjoys the epic story of the games. It is also a great read for anyone who enjoys a good fantasy/adventure novel.

B000F39MAG|5.0|Oh dear.  I was about to write a full review of this wonderful interpretation when I read the review of Niel Rishol.  That is very perceptive and complete; and I do not know what I can add to it.<br /><br />I have seen the (unfortunately delisted) production with Pendatchanska playing Queen Elizabeth and as good as she and the other three main characters are, that is a classical production with a wallpaper chorus to stand around and sing from time to time.<br /><br />In contrast this updated production is extremely well directed and choreographed.  The chorus all have got into the action and.have their specific tasks.  They and the principals are all deeply into their roles and as a result the film editing is made easy with many appropriate reaction shots.  Therefore, as a drama it is very taut, despite the bel canto arias, and the tension increases steadily as the work progresses.<br /><br />I should not be surprised by now, but I usually am when it comes to new interpretations of operas which work and shed new light on a production which one thinks one knows -- only to find how many people do not seem to be able to make the jump into the mind of the director and try to figure out why he has done what he has done.  So far as I am concerned this interpretation works extremely well.  Because the characters are modern and because we have at least read about abusive regimes, even when they are presented as \\"democratic\\", it shows how prescient Donizetti and his librettist were to have written an opera that not only makes sense in modern times, but can be enhanced by a modern production.<br /><br />For a fuller comment, see Mr. Rishol's review.
B0000024IE|5.0|Especially 911 Is A Joke. I grew up in Los Angeles, and remember very clearly how when people from South Central would call 911, it would literally take hours for the  paramedics to arrive---if they arrived at all! I also remember when someone was shot and how he called 911 and identified himself as a cop to insure paramedics would come, he got charged with something like impersonating a cop, but could you really blame him?<br />Fight The Power is also on the money and extremely powerful--it is VH1's #1 rap hit video of all time.<br />I don't think the lyrics are particularly explicit, IMO, sometimes such words are necessary to get particular points across. Though Tipper Gore, the sheltered former second lady of the United States and Parents Music Resource Center activist might disagree.<br /><br />This CD has way more political points than it does profane words. Public Enemy said what needed to be said and what many were thinking but couldn't or wouldn't verbalize for whatever reason...

0439023513|5.0|This book gets a definite 5 out of 5 gnomes.  Reading through this book there are so many quotable quotes and by the end I know I was pretty emotionally/brain drained.<br />I loved this book so much.  How much you may ask?  Well, the day it came out when I was at work I bought the eBook version from Barnes & Noble and started reading.  Later on the way home I bought a hard cover copy from Borders with a 50% off coupon.  All together I spent as much as the hardcover of the book would have been without a coupon so yes I feel it was indeed worth the money.<br /><br />The book starts with Katniss standing in the rubble that was once her home.  Katniss, as anyone who's read all the books would know, has been through a lot.  She was a different person in this book but she also had been through two fights to the death and is now in the middle of an actual war, I think that would make anybody a loner.  This means that throughout the book she seems more unstable than usual and probably has a severe case of what we today would call PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).  Personally I think I would be cranky too if I was in the situation Katniss was in as she says,<br />\\"Right now, they leave me alone because I'm classified as mentally disoriented--it says so right on my plastic medical bracelet--and everyone has to tolerate my ramblings.  But that can't last forever.  Neither can their patience with the Mockingjay issue.\\"<br /><br />Lots of spoilers after this,<br /><br />It was great having to see the relationship between Peeta and Katniss reform after his hijacking.  I think his being gone made her realize how much he had come to mean to her.  They have their bumpy moments of course with the whole him being programmed to kill her part.  This does lead to both sides knowing the complete truth now so their feelings can start anew and not have any lies for the cameras like there were before.  Another great part is the Real or not Real game that they have to play with Peeta and that it becomes a recurring part of their relationship.<br /><br />I was really sad that Cinna was dead, I kept expecting him to turn up somewhere but that was nothing compared to the death of first Finnick and then Prim.  I was not expecting her to die at all and right in front of Katniss.  It was heart wrenching especially since she was so much closer to Prim then she ever was with her mother and now she really has no family left besides a mother who won't even go back to 12 with her.  It was very surprising when Buttercup showed up and was the one that finally made her break down/cry over the loss of her sister.  Katniss and that cat are really very similar.<br /><br />I believe that Gale never really had a chance with Katniss, there was just too much distrust between them.  Then when it was his invention/bomb plan being used to kill her sister and all those other children there was really no way things could get better between them.  I think the destruction of 12 made Gale vent his hatred out at the world while Katniss really internalized the loss.<br /><br />I love how Snow is the one he connects everything together for her about 13 and their intentions and part in everything.  District 13 aka President Coin sent her sister to the front lines even though she was 13 not 14 like the age limit Also how 13 sent her sister there as a medic at the age of 13 when you had to be 14 to be a soldier.  How they started the initial war and reminding her that in this war the Capitol had no hovercraft left.  So to use historical events 13 pretty much committed a small scale Hiroshima type attack.<br /><br />It was great/fitting for Snow that he died by choking while laughing.  It was sad but fitting that both her and Peeta were set/caught on fire it kind of flashed you back to the first games and then it's just made more real because they are actually burning.<br /><br />The fact that they live in the victors village together and that many people came back to live there shows that 12 might just be the best place for Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch and the rest who can't really be themselves anywhere else.<br /><br />I see the epilogue as very fitting, just two haunted people trying to move on with their lives.Peeta and Haymitch and the rest who can't really be themselves anywhere else.     I see the epilogue as very fitting, just two haunted people trying to move on with their lives.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This new Skynet Edition of this Blu-ray T2 is much more better than the original Blu-ray T2, I'm glad it has much more special features, because I wondered how the T-1000 body got ripped apart and I was very interested in that. This movie has a pretty good sound and a totally a better screen of views. The movie has lots of special features like games, quizzes, and a lot more. The thing that I think is that it even works in a normal DVD Player and a High Definition Player! It is the best Blu-ray DVD I ever saw!   It's cool and gets everything right. This DVD provides things that other Blu-ray discs that don't provide. It shows every part how they act!  You should watch it, Really....................................

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I received my package in less than a week after ordering. I was very pleased & would recommend ordering from this company again.
B0040QYROK|5.0|If you want to see the movie that has spawned inspiration for films and shows like Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, Batman, Dark City, Star Trek, Equilibrium, and a score of others this is it. It's the silent movie made in the 1920's that ended up creating the whole dystopian/cyberpunk genre that became popular generations later. At the time the movie was only a moderate success and was even panned by many critics and science fiction writers. With hindsight being 20/20 there has been much recanting. Still I can understand some of the criticism. Either way today Metropolis is considered a foundation film that launched a genre of films (at least visually if not conceptually).     Metropolis the story is essentially about the struggle involving the social and economic class structure. You have the working class toiling away on the bottom of the city so that the upper class can live in luxury and ease. Somebody from the privileged class sees the inhumane treatment of the workers and tries to help. At the same time a mad scientist and his machinations create a revolt of the underclass that threatens to destroy the city.     So what makes this movie great? It's the visuals and special effects that stand out the most. You can almost say this is the first special effect blockbuster style movie. The cityscape was impressive model work for its time. The sets (especially the Heart Machine) were also pretty impressive (and big for being inside a studio). The scenes with the creation of the robot were amazing then, and the robot itself is still an iconic image in sci-fi. The story is also a winner as it's the classic dystopian conflict that has been told again and again in other shows and books.     So why did the critics pan the movie back then? Well to be frank why do critics pan the current special effects blockbuster Avatar? \\"Too much focus on special effects and not enough on story\\", \\"it's the same plot as (in Metropolis' case Frankenstein)\\", \\"it's too cliche\\". Well you get the idea. Metropolis relied on basic man vs. man and man vs. machine conflict elements without trying to be too complex on that vein. Also the running time for Metropolis is 90+ minutes (depending on what version), which can get pretty drawn out for a silent film. Many of the scenes play out longer than they may need to as far as keeping the attentions of the average viewer. One reviewer (sci-fi author) even panned the special effects showing propeller powered airplanes when he figured the future would hold different technologies. So yeah the movie is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. However the good this movie has does outweigh the bad in terms of how much movie history came from it.    Metropolis is a public domain film. Which means nobody owns the copyright. Which means everybody and their dog can obtain a copy and sell it. That's exactly what has been happening over the years. With the advent of DVD technology it was a veritable minefield of versions out there ranging from adequate to so-crappy-it-doesn't-deserve-to-be-put-on-dvd. It wasn't until 2003 when an authorized version was restored and made the gold standard for DVD. This version also sported the original score for the film, which many of the others lacked to the point where the music actually made the experience worse. So the Restored Authorized version on DVD was the best you can get and deservedly so... until now.     What we have on The Complete Metropolis is not only an authorized remaster done on Blu-Ray (1080p), but 25 minutes of additional footage have been uncovered after 80 years and put back into the film. This is the most complete version of Metropolis you will ever find! It's even more complete than what moviegoers in America saw in the theaters. Now the new footage is seriously old and nowhere nearly as well preserved as the rest so you will notice the differences between the cuts. A small price to pay really. On top of that you get the original score in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 performed by the Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra in Berlin (Frank Strobel conducting). In other words this will be the best looking, best sounding, most complete version of this movie that ever existed.     Extras are sparse, but worth it. You get a high definition 50 minute documentary, Voyage to Metropolis, that goes over the making and restoration of the film. You also get an interview with Paula Felix-Didier, who is curator of the museum that uncovered the lost footage. And to top off the extras list a recent movie trailer. The only downside on this is the extras that were on the Restored Authorized edition are not to be found. That one had two featurettes (one on the making of the movie and one on the restoration) in multiple languages, production stills, cast and crew biographies, commentaries and more. If you ask me this \\"complete\\" edition can use some more meat when compared.     If you want the most complete footage of Metropolis in existence, AND in high definition, then now is your chance. While this disk may be sparse on the extras it does make up for it in the treatment of one of science fiction's most prized treasures.

It is not at all what I expected from a Toy Story sequel, and although my daughter would have watched it to the end, she's 4 and will watch pretty much anything in animation form. After we took it out of the DVD player we threw it in the trash. It was that awful.

0439023513|2.0|While this review is short, I must make it clear that I LOVED the first two books. I loaned them out and sang their praises. Like most other Hunger Games fans, I pre-ordered Mockingjay in February 2010 and waited six months for the arrival. And there - the day I found it in my mailbox, was the height of the excitement for Mockingjay. Katniss Everdeen was no longer inspiring, not a fighter - the TWO characteristics that made her THE STORY. ****SPOILER ALERT**** Sure, the fight was taken from her when she couldn't get to Peeta, but when finally... when he was returned from his totally anti-climatic rescue, she behaved as a spoiled child - the one thing she was never. I won't go on with specifics, I will just point out what so many others have - I wasn't looking for an \\"everybody's happy\\" ending, but the wasn't one twist, not one amazing turn. The ending was the downer of the year - this book ruined the first two.
031237593X|5.0|First, a confession. I am a major historical fiction junkie. I grew up reading Jean Plaidy, Norah Lofts, Victoria Holt, Alison Weir and Mary Stewart. I'm also a fan of Phillipa Gregory.  This book covers a lot of the same ground that Gregory has covered in her books, especially \\"The Red Queen\\" and the \\"The White Queen.\\" But author Penman's style is not at all like Gregory's style.     Reading a novel by Phillipa Gregory is like eating a bag of M & M's. It is so delightful. It is so quick to consume. You know what to expect. You will always want more.     But reading this novel is like eating gourmet chocolates. It's rich. It explodes in your mouth. It's complex. It takes you a long time to savor the flavors present. You will want more, after you get done savoring the flavor. But not right away, because there's a lot to digest.     Richard III's entire life is covered here, from start to finish. No detail is spared. The point of view from multiple characters completely fleshes out the plot. It is riveting, most of the time. Richard III's battle prowess is well-addressed. His love match with his wife is touchingly described. The family dynamics that determined the politics and lives of the protagonists in the novel are believable and fascinating. Penman's version of Richard III is so believable that I had to force myself to finish the book. Why? Because I knew that he dies at Bosworth Field, and I couldn't bear to read the description of his death. I felt like I knew him. The novel is that gripping.     It's a monster of a book: 944 pages. If you're reading the Kindle version, there are some minor formatting issues. Still, I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to anglophiles and historical fiction lovers. It's a keeper.
B001U0D786|4.0|\\"The English Patient\\", 1996's Best Picture winner, is an adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's 1992 novel, which was the first Canadian novel to win the Booker Prize (as well as the first of three Governor General's Awards for Ondaatje).  It was adapted by producer Saul Zaentz, something of a specialist in adapting complicated works of literature to the screen (having won two previous Best Picture Oscars for \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" and \\"Amadeus\\").  An illustrious pedigree to keep in mind when approaching it today, though the film has also suffered some backlash based on an episode of \\"Seinfeld\\".  Overall, I'd put this on the list of films that I liked more than the books they're adapted from.  Spoilers follow.    Our story opens with the image of a biplane carrying two people being shot down in the desert.  Picked up by passing Bedouins, a severely burned man (Ralph Fiennes) is pulled from the wreckage, and eventually finds his way into the hands of the Canadian Army as they make their way through Italy in the waining months of 1945.  The \\"English Patient\\", as he is dubbed, is grotesquely burned and slowly dying (the very handsome Fiennes would not look this ugly again onscreen until he signed on to play Lord Voldemort in \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" a decade hence), and is left to spend his final days in an abandoned Italian monastery with a single nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche, who won Best Supporting Actress for the role), for company.  They are joined in short order by another Montrealer, Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe; incidentally, I suppose all the Canadians in Hollywood were busy playing Americans and they had to recruit French Binoche and American Dafoe for these parts), and two British minesweepers, Kip (Naveen Andrews, later of \\"Lost\\") and Hardy.  Caravaggio, a Canadian spy, has suspicions about the English Patient, while Hana and Kip strike up a relationship.  Slowly, the English Patient reveals his backstory, which involves multinational archaelogical expeditions in the 1930s North Africa, and a torrid affair with Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott-Thomas), the wife of his colleague Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth; it's a rare movie that sees Colin Firth lose the girl, and, weirdly enough, one of the other instances was \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", where he lost her to Ralph Fiennes' brother Joseph).    The screenplay by the late Anthony Minghella (also the director) corrects some of the problems I had with the novel by providing some dramatic impetus to the question of who the English Patient is by the changes to Caravaggio's backstory (in the novel, there's really no reason that anyone should care who he is, and nothing would have changed if they'd never found out who he was). I think the theme of transcending nationalities and such is also better conveyed. They've shifted the focus from Hana and Kip to Almasy and Katharine, which works fine.  I'm guessing Minghella felt there was more story there. Minghella also cuts out the unhappy ending to Hana and Kip's relationship, which I'm sure some people think is Hollywoodized, but I'm fine with, because I thought their breakup in the novel was unconvincing (like Ondaatje suddenly realized that the story was almost over and if things ended well it wouldn't be \\"art\\"). On the demerit scale, the charge that it's long and ponderous has a bit of merit; and I think the character of Geoffrey Clifton really needed more time than the story gives him, given how important his actions are toward the climax.     Still, I think it's a very solid film.
B00095NX9G|4.0|Other than my music complaint (save whispers song. I love that one)  this is a SENSATIONAL DVD. packed with lots of information and fun.    I only labeled it a 4 star because I can't stand one of the choreography music choices that sounds like a big-top circus. It's all personal taste of course, I had no fun learning it. I am glad however she chooses a fast tempo song and a slow tempo song so you can be snakey like she.     I still think this is a DVD worth purchasing for the educational value and love of RB.     I love that she adds mini classes which include how to time music aka music theory, and yoga for back bends. Everything else has been said by previous reviewees as to contents. Thank you, Rachel!
0061251305|3.0|I thought this book was about influencing groups, which it was to a certain extent.  But the book was more about the various levels of tribal behavior that are found in organization.  This part was helpful, as you have five major levels of a organization.  The language of the organization seems to indicate which level the group is at.  One level is very pessimistic while the fifth level has the attitude that life is great.  This is the progression for groups, from life is unfair or bad, to life is great.  The books provides skills to move an organization through the various tribal attitudes.  This was not my favorite book because it seemed too long for the amount of information given.  One you understand the levels of tribal attitudes, it seems to take forever to progress through them.  It was helpful to learn the language of the tribes, but mostly this was the best part of the book, and there was not much else to it.  I was a little disappoint in this work.  It was not what I expected which might have lead to the negative attitude, or maybe I am just not level five tribe.  This was written to a business culture, and it had some application to the church culture, but mostly I could tell you the application in one chapter, not 10.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|I've seen somewhat odd reviews for this cd. I guess it's because john doesn't have a whole lot of guitar work in here as far as his capabilities, which I admit is frustrating. But come on. You have to see him live to get the full effect. John's cd however is full of great songs. He is very talented and we see that all over this release. I don't really know what any one can complain about this album. You won't regret buying this, then go buy \\"AS/IS\\" if you don't have it. Peace.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I love the new direction that Katy Perry has taken in this new album - she's combined dance/pop together with her pop-rock anthems. It's a welcome change to hear Katy really having fun with her music. We really don't need to be making social statements all the time with music or need to sound intelligent. Music could also be about having fun! The first seven songs are those that will probably enshrined in the hall of pop confection ditties - pure delights and will be played over and over again on the radio, like Peacock (listen to this one!! the lyrics are exaggerated and funny!), TGIF, Teenage Dream, California girls, firework, the one that got away. Here she attempts to chart new direction in her music by having songs that are less rock infused and more oriented towards the dance floor. While the lyrics of some of the songs are non descript, the melodies have strong hooks that will ensure this album will do well way into next year. She has a strong production team which she uses advantageously to add to her repertoire of musical offerings. She clearly is quite savvy in her marketing and her effort to gain a broader audience than her first album. I never knew that she could craft a great pop album with mass appeal but she has with \\"Teenage Dream.\\"

B003PIUC02|1.0|I was very excited when I saw this coming to TV so I eagerly tuned in...What a mistake....This was clearly nothing more than an excuse to have as many naked penises on screen as possible. I quit after a few episodes because clearly all the excessive male nudity was targeted at women or gay men. You got men kissing, men rolling around on the ground \\"fighting\\" naked of course, full frontal male nudity but only partial female nudity. If you like looking at naked men this Blu-ray is for you but for straight men its just another reminder of all the people desperately working to push a gay adgenda.
B001I82RVS|4.0|Lately these over-the-top Japanese movies have really gotten popular in the US.. I'm thrilled about it as I've always found them incredibly entertaining!<br /><br />One of the \\"main ones\\" over the last year has been Tokyo Gore Police. The director is the same guy who has worked on Mutant Girls Squad, Robogeisha, Vampire Girl VS Frankenstein Girl, Samurai Princess, Hard Revenge Milly, Machine Girl and Meatball Machine (to name a few).<br /><br />That should give you an idea of what to expect. Over the top gore, action and entertainment. Most people I talked to told me to ignore this one as it wasn't up to the level of other \\"gore greats\\" and was a much slower-paced, more story-focused movie.. I'm glad I didn't listen as it was very entertaining throughout! Very over the top, similar to the classic Riki-OH movie.<br /><br />One nice thing is that the effects and gore seem to be done with real props, not just CG (which really shows in these low-budget films). It also seemed to have a surprisingly high budget and turned out nicely.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />I do have a gripe with the studio, Tokyo Shock, who has a tendency to hold back on content only to re-release it (or re-re-release it) later on. With Tokyo Gore Police you get no extras.. to get those (including a 45-minute spinoff film), you need to buy the newly released [[ASIN:B00393SG1K Tokyo Gore Police 1.5 (2pc) (Dub Sub)]] - They recently did this with Machine Girl.. Releasing the movie by itself, then \\"The Machine Girl Remix\\" (which has a spinoff film) and now \\"The Ultimate Machine Girl\\" as a 3-disc tin containing the Remix discs and a new disc of extras. I wouldn't be surprised if we see another Tokyo Gore Police release (3rd one) which includes the extras from the original japanese DVD release.<br /><br />Still, even just for the movie it's definitely worth checking out. I liked it enough to order the Tokyo Gore Police 1.5 DVD just to see the continuation through the spinoff film.
B003ZSIS6C|5.0|Chris Guillebeau has set the world on the razor's edge living the life that many dream about traveling to the far corners of the world.  Being a nonconformist, to some it may seem that Chris lives an unprincipled life.  But Chris really lives according to his own principles.  He asks his readers to keep an open mind and just give his ideas a try.    He asks his readers, not only to consider their own needs, but to also contemplate:  1. What needs can you meet?  2. Who looks to you as a leader?  3. What bothers you about the world?  4. How can you make things better?  5. What can you offer the world that no one else can?   As Chris says, if you want to live a remarkable life you can do good things for yourself while helping other people at the same time.    I highly recommend this book because these ideas can help to make this a better world for everyone.

1932907009|2.0|Snyder says it himself: \\"Write the same thing only different\\". This self-aggrandizing screenwriter, whose sole writing credits are the Disney flop \\"Blank Check\\" and that timeless classic: \\"Stop or my Mom will Shoot\\", espouses taking commercially successful works and rehashing them with some tweaks. Hey, if that's all you really want - to write the same old same old and hope some Soul-less studio exec is hooked by it, rather than writing something original and fresh - well then this is the book for you. If you think \\"Miss Congeniality\\" was a wonderful film and \\"Memento\\" was some \\"art house\\" flop, then you should go down the formulaic path Mr. Snyder espouses.<br /><br />The bottom line is there are better books on structure and format and style, like \\"The Screenwriter's Bible\\" and \\"Elements of Style for Screenwriters\\". As for what sort of storytelling you should do - you need to decide that for yourself. Do you want to write \\"Lethal Weapon 17\\" or \\"Shrek 9\\"? Do you want to be a commercial hack churning out repetitive reheated clones of clones of clones or write original and fresh stories?  I'd guess your chances of selling a screenplay are about the same, but the buying party might be different.<br /><br />This is definitely the last book on screenwriting I would recommend to a friend!<br /><br />Cute cover photo though.

Unlike PowerPoint, which tends to facilitate you telling your story (top-down), David Sibbet's techniques help you build a strategy / plan / goals with the input and insights of everyone who you engage, whether in a meeting / workshop / retreat (bottom-up).   My experience with David's work includes academia, the Pentagon, and non-profits: in each case, the results have been compelling and the buy-in very strong.  If you want be a leader who brings out the best in other people, this is the guide to have in your hands.
0399536108|5.0|The thing I like best about this book is that it is NOT a manual on how to break the rules, how to be an anarchist, how to defy authority and give it the middle finger. Instead, Chris is really making one simple point in a variety of different ways:<br /><br />Know where your present actions are taking you.<br /><br />Does it make sense to follow the conventional path? Maybe, if you want a fairly conventional life. Should you quit your job and do your own thing? Well, Chris certainly thinks that's preferable, but if you're clear about all of the details of what \\"life with your job\\" entails -- the lifestyle, the salary, the prospects for retirement, and so on -- and you're cool with all of that, then you should probably keep that job.<br /><br />The other day, I quoted Chris on Twitter: \\"Only about 80% of my experience in higher education was a waste of time; the other 20% was important and useful.\\"<br /><br />I laughed out loud when I read that (there are a bunch of LOL moments in the book, but they're understated in Chris's characteristic way), but he responded on Twitter and said that he was quite happy with that 20% and found it worth the whole college experience. It was the people who expected 80% value, he said, who were probably in for a rude awakening.<br /><br />You take an honest look at what you're likely to get from what you're doing right now. Will college guarantee you a job? Does doing well in high school increase your ability to make a living later (i.e. is your study time going to pay off in money or something else you value)? Are you likely to become rich working for someone else? I'd argue (and I think Chris would agree) that the answer to all three is no. If you know that going in, then you can go through high school, college, and your career with your eyes open and take other things from them of value. Or you can skip out on one, two, or all three. It's your choice, and you can make it once you see where you're headed. If you stay where you are, you are choosing to accept what is likely to come from it.<br /><br />This is a manual for seeing where you are, analyzing what you're likely to get, and helping you to make a change if you want something better -- and understanding that rules mean little when what's holding you back in the end is you.ely to come from it.

B001EO748M|5.0|While not always historically accurate, this series definately drives home the drive and determination of King Henry the VIII.  I believe Showtime does an excellent job engaging people in the story and period.  I believe watching this show will spur interest in English history for those that may not have had it otherwise.  At that point, they can discover the \\"true\\" history.    If you're looking for complete historical accuracy, this isn't for you.  If you're looking for stunning visual images, drama, and great acting, purchase the series for sure.
0451228375|5.0|I was a fan of Pillars and once I put it down, I picked up World Without End. It picks up in Kingsbridge 200 years later. I was just as enamored with the storyline and characters as I was in the first book. It was a page turner. If there was a third book, I'd have read it too!
0767903862|4.0|Bryson loves England - that is obvious in [[ASIN:0771017049 Notes from a Small Island]]. In Australia, however, he is an outsider on a visit (not a resident) and the difference is obvious in the style and character of this book.<br /><br />In 'Notes from a Small Island', Bryson skips easily from topic to topic, highlighting whichever particular memories strike his fancy. Here, however, we are presented with much more of a standard travelogue in which a good deal more historical and geographical detail provided. Most of it though, I am glad to say, is presented in the light, humorous way in which this author usually entertains me and I enjoyed it immensely. I am cognizant that some reviewers have criticized Bryson for being less than accurate and not 'in-depth' enough, but I didn't buy this book as a sociological, political, or 'what-have-you' treatise, I sometimes just liked to hear a story about somebody's experiences... that's what this book is. I should add that, while my wife and I have very different tastes in literature, I gave her this book before she took a trip to a conference in Sidney and she enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />My only quibble about this book is as follows: When Bryson is at his most fluid and honest, his humor is easy and very natural. When he *tries* to be funny, however, the prose becomes noticeably forced and the resultant humor declines proportionately. In this book, he confesses to a fear of dogs and goes into a lengthy description of an encounter with one in suburban Sidney. Unfortunately, his particular reaction to canines is not one shared by most people so this whole attempt at to provide a comic 'filler' ended up being little more than tedious... for me at least.<br /><br />Still a great book though :)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I am a PROCESSED-FOODS CONVERT, thanks to this amazing documentary, and subsequently others similar to it in nature.     Before, I mindlessly went about my daily life, buying processed foods and easy take-out for too many years, being a busy working mom with two kids in two activities at a time. Hey, they wouldn't put anything to compromise our health in those boxes. Yeah....right....     Since about April of this year, I've been researching & learning about natural foods, enzymes and how incredibly valuable they are for us all, and most shockingly, what's happening to our food supply right under our very noses as we go about our busy lives, assuming everything is just fine.     There is so much MSG & HFCS (High fructose corn syrup) in the majority of processed foods, which so many of us are eating AND feeding our children, not to mention the genetic modification of the very seeds we need to sustain life, which this film documents and explains very, very well.     Companies are patenting and modifying the very DNA of the plants we eat and feed our livestock & poultry. Let that sink in for a moment. One of those also makes a very potent & popular weed killer. Hmmmm....food supply owners AND poison factory? The same company? Hmmmmmm...     If you educate yourself by buying growth-hormone free, antibiotic free, non-genetically modified 100% ORGANIC vegetable, dairy and meat products, you VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLARS & the producers will get the message. The first documentary I watched on the subject was Food, Inc., and is a real eye-opener. This led to the viewing and further investigation of others. The more I uncovered, the more upset I became, but then I empowered myself again, as I am in charge of what I put into my body!     I also got the KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus 5-Quart Stand Mixer, in Black, at the same time, to make this new lifestyle choice less a chore & more doable. It's the best kitchen appliance I've ever owned, and makes cooking from scratch easy, peasy!Clean up is also a snap. This all came together for me because of this movie, and Michael Pollan's \\"Food Rules\\".      The Fannie Farmer cookbook, recommended to me 15 years ago by my sister-in-law as a must-have, truly is a must-have! You will not be sorry, and even the pickiest of eaters will not be able to get enough.     ***IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WANTING TO LOSE WEIGHT:     It has been my experience that eating REAL food without added fillers, preservatives & other chemical alteration FILLS YOU UP much faster than the processed stuff. MUCH! You'll have a lot of food left over when you cook and eat this way - the way we were meant to, so stock up on some freezer containers or a vacuum sealer. I got both.     Doctors & alternative health practitioners stress that we should eat natural sugars, not artificial sweeteners. Eat actual, natural foods from this Earth, without all the added nonsense, and you'll naturally eat less. Plus, your body knows what to do with real sugar & how to process & eliminate it.

Amazon made it right however and sent us the blue ray version and the dvd version seperately and then they gave us a code to download our digital copy from Amazon Unbox.  It all works great.
0307463745|5.0|as others have said, the concepts are clear, concise, and of critical importance to any business who doesn't completely own their market (everyone?). for much of the book, you could expand 'business' to apply to everyone with career aspirations -- you don't have to be an owner or Chief Something Officer.<br /><br />the real beauty of the book is that it's anecdotal. this is not the end of all business wisdom, it's just a lot of really excellent experiential observations. I don't agree with every statement, but that's not the point. it gets you thinking. you second guess what you thought were business requisites. as with their S vs N posts, the ideas bring you back to common sense and away from MBA school.<br /><br />you'll remember the lessons they've learned because they get right to the point. and if you forget something, just read the whole book again -- you'll be done by the end of the week if you're a slow reader.<br /><br />if I were rating the illustrations (as a whole) I think I'd offer 3 stars at best. the style is fun and casual (like the writing). a few are fantastic and you'll want them posted 6 feet tall in your office. many, however, are just the chapter title written out in sketchy lettering (which is then repeated in type on the opposing page). not very helpful. the constraint of one illustration for every chapter (often as little as 1 page of text) did not add value to the project. I would've preferred a slimmer volume to all the graphic noise.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|Amazon won't like this- but save yourself some money and just go to his website.  Most of the information I was really looking for was there-- which is what prompted me to buy the book.  This said, I liked it anyway... it makes sense looking at biomechanics that big padded shoes dont help- and may well hurt us.  I don't run with a \\"heel to toe\\" gait, but more of a flat foot strike- so I was looking for information on less constructed shoes & a way to run w/ less pain.  This is not the most well written book- which is sad as he is apparently a sports writer. He can be funny- but the back story is so long & drawn out that I really skimmed over a lot of it just to get to the technical stuff.
0399536108|5.0|The Art of Non-Conformity is not a self-help book, or a business book, or a travel book.      It is simply a book about life; but not the kind of life you've been living.  It's about the kind of life you want to live.      Chris writes about the things that keep us from living that life-- sheer fear, criticism from the masses, uncertainty about the outcome.  And bit by bit, he breaks down those barriers between us and our \\"ideal lifestyle\\" to making \\"having it all\\" seem a little less scary.     He tells his story along the way--he's an ex-volunteer (Africa), blogger, and self-employed non-conformist.      He doesn't tell you how to work less, but how to work better.  He doesn't tell you how to make a lot of money, but how to balance your money-making and your life.  He doesn't tell you that you'll overcome your fears forever, but that you'll deal with them one at a time.      The book begins with the story of Bernard Lopez, a man who gave up his cushy New York job to bike across America.  By the end, you feel as though Chris has given you the tools to also say \\"forget this!\\" and pursue your big, insane idea.      It reads easy and was clearly meant for those with acute ADD; lots of little stories, anecdotes, quotes, and lists to keep you interested.      I've been reading his blog for quite awhile now and can wholeheartedly say that most of the words this guy writes are helpful in ways that you can't imagine until you read.  If you ever said \\"I'm unhappy with my status quo life,\\" then this is probably for you.

B00164CM46|5.0|My review isn't long. I loved this movie! It was hilarious. If you're not accustomed to various accents then I would suggest you put the subtitles on because the dialog is laugh out loud funny. The sub plots are fun to watch unfold and everything ties in together pretty well. Overall, the hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If all my fingers were thumbs I'd give it 10 thumbs up!
0393927547|1.0|As a student in college, having the edition requested by the professor is important to success in that class. Needless to say, after waiting for forever to have the book delivered, I was severely disappointed to find that they sent me the wrong edition of the book when the receipt that came with it made it clear that I had asked for a different edition. I made over 12 orders for textbooks at the same time, and this was the only order that 1) came a week later than everything else and 2) sent me the completely wrong edition.
0553805371|1.0|Stephen Hawking will most certainly, and deservedly so, lose his reputation as the most important physicist since Einstein with the release of this book.     In short, he joins the ranks of carnival physicists, tele-evangelists, and Scientologists, with regards to the origins of the universe.     Somehow (I'm still not sure how), he comes to the conclusion that gravity is responsible for the formation of not just this universe, but many other universes. He doesn't really detail this line of thinking, only that it has something loosely to do with m-theory or string theory (two theories, by the way, with more holes in them than a good hunk of Swiss cheese).     He seems like an exceedingly arrogant man who is simply trying to shock the masses into buying this book and trying to prove his profound and diligent opinion that God does not exist.    He proves absolutely nothing, other than this book is a waste of time and money.
B001FB5634|4.0|Some reviewers are comparing this to The Book of Eli or I am Legend because the setting is similar.  The Road is far more devastating, miserable, and stark than those other films.  The Book of Eli and I am Legend have hero-centric myths attached to their plots, which make the films cartoony, mere dabbling in the post-apocalyptic genre.  There's nothing goofy about The Road.  It is a sustained embrace of a nightmare world where the soul is all but wrested from the clutches of humanity.  One of the pitfalls of the movie is that I cannot imagine wanting to watch it again.  It's a depressing and hopeless trudge for survival and basic necessities.    If you can handle the content of the film, you can take a step back and see the beauty in the direction, photography, and cinematography.  The world of the film looks utterly alien, a battered and starved America.  There's very little color in the film, and so when they do appear, colors are mysterious and seemingly out of place, almost haunting.  For these reasons, I recommend the film.  The plot may not be particularly original, but characters' journey is heart-wrenching and true.
B00006I53S|4.0|This lens is amazing for traveling. It has the perfect range of focal lengths for wide angle landscape shots, to portraits, to close ups, and even macro shots. I really appreciate the fact that I can bring one lens with me instead of my whole kit of prime lenses. Granted this is a variable aperture zoom and no where near as sharp as my prime lenses, but it wins me over with its versatility and the lack of weight in my camera bag. A big plus to this lens is that you will not be changing lenses often or at all which will cut down on dust getting on the sensor. My only issues with the lens is that you have to constantly keep an eye on the zoom as mine likes to slip away from 28mm. I do not know if this is a normal problem with this lens or if mine needs to be adjusted by Canon. The build of this lens is a bit cheap being as light as it is along with the plastic feel. I do wish that Canon made this lens a little wider as a 24mm would really be a complete package. But overall I am super pleased with this lens and would recommend it for travel, location scouting, or just walking around.
0743289684|5.0|This is the most moving and timely biography that I have read. Hirsi Ali is the most amazing woman of our time. The book documents the transformation of a child of a Nomad into a leading intellectual of Islamic criticism and Islamic woman's rights. Ayaan's story will challenge, astound, and pain the Western reader. It doesn't seem possible, yet it happens, she suffers and grows before our eyes. I feel so fortunate that Ayaan is now in the USA. Hope you enjoy this book as much as I.
0596805888|4.0|Cooking for Geeks, by Jeff Potter, published by O'Reilly Media    Cooking for Geeks by Jeff Potter is the cookbook for people who pestered their parents with \\"why\\" questions and were never content with the universal answer of the exasperated, \\"because I said so.\\"     Cooking for Geeks offers an in-depth look at the science of food, and provides detailed and well researched answers to many questions:  Why is it better to weigh, rather than measure, your ingredients? (Weighing is more accurate.) Why is commercial baking powder better than the common tightwad substitute of 2 parts cream of tartar to 1 part baking soda? (Because the commercial kind typically uses multiple types of acid, allowing the CO 2 to release over time, rather than all at once.) How do you create a super hot pizza oven in your own home? (According to Jeff Varasano, C++ programmer turned Atlanta pizzeria owner, clip the lock and bake pizza during the oven's cleaning cycle.)    Cooking for Geeks also include interesting interviews with well-known geeks who answer even more questions--Adam Savage, of Mythbusters, discusses how they test myths on TV, and how the same principle (change one variable at a time!) can be applied to cooking, while Adam Ried, of America's Test Kitchen and The Boston Globe, talks about developing new recipes by making charts comparing the ingredients and methods in 40 or more existing recipes for the dish he wants to cook.     Offering 30 pages on kitchen equipment and organization, Cooking for Geeks seems to assume that geeks are novice cooks. The recipes, however, are often lacking in sufficient detail to be successfully prepared, even by an experienced cook. For example, the \\"Rosemary Mashed Potatoes\\" recipe on page 201 offers a novel method of preparing potatoes for mash: by microwaving them. Potter explains why this works, but neglects a couple of key points: what are the properties of a microwaved potato when it is ready to mash? And, is it necessary to pierce or cut the potato before cooking? (We ordinarily would poke a potato before cooking it, but since it wasn't mentioned in a book that seems geared to unexperienced cooks, we didn't want to assume. We thought perhaps piercing the potato allow too much moisture to escape, leaving the potato starch unable to expand. But also wondered if the unpierced potato would explode.) In keeping with the theme of the book, and, honestly, hoping to witness an explosion, we designed our own experiment: three batches of potatoes, one pierced; one un-pierced, and a control batch boiled the old fashioned way. We found that the un-pierced potatoes didn't explode. We hypothesized that this was because the recipe called for red potatoes with thin skins, not russets with heavier skin. Further, the unpierced potatoes didn't cook as thoroughly as the pierced potatoes. After 6 minutes, both were soft enough that we could poke them with a fork (the common test for doneness of a potato) but the unpierced ones had hard spots throughout. They were difficult to mash and left crunchy bits throughout. The pierced potatoes cooked through, resulting in coarse and chunky mashed potatoes. The boiled potatoes control group lost less than one-half the water of the pierced group and one-fourth the water of the non-pierced group. We should have adjusted the amount of sour cream and milk, for they had an almost oatmeal-like consistency.    Cooking for Geeks made acids and bases far more entertaining than our Chemistry textbook ever did, helped us understand what people mean when they say they \\"need an E-numbers fix\\" and introduced us to Doug Powell's amusing food safety site: [...]. We copied the lists of flavors used in various ethnic foods and the chart of substitutions for foods that commonly cause allergies to keep in the kitchen for easy reference and inspiration. Cooking For Geeks offered us a method to explore many of the questions we've had about food and cooking. Yes, we wish the recipes were more detailed. No we don't plan to use liquid nitrogen the next time we make ice cream or to flash-pickle cucumbers with a vacuum sealer. Even so, we appreciated and enjoyed this book--it's a far more entertaining introduction to science than anything we read during our K-12 years.
0060888709|3.0|Although the contents of the book from a literary standpoint is superb, the reading by Sissy Spacek is average compared to other books on CDs I heard before. While she is reading from one character to another, her voice and accent does not change. It's like you are listening to the same person with a heavy southern drawl. It's rather confusing at times and difficult to listen to throughout the hold novel. I must say, Mrs. Spacek accent of \\"Scout\\" was excellent.
B001152TL6|5.0|For all those who said they could not understand the movie or appreciate the storyline, etc., and thus gave this film a low rating, here is a summary of the narrative so that you may wish to watch the movie again and enjoy it.    NARRATIVE    Pete Dayton a young attractive man works as a mechanic during the day and goes partying at night, and hangs out with Sheila a girl from the nighbourhood. His parents are nice and calm and do not intervene much in his life. One day at work he meets this girl, Alice Wakefield who was in the company of Dick Laurent a customer wanting to repair his car. She caught his eyes ogling her and she comes alone in the evening. Thus started a sexual relationship between her and the mechanic. Now Alice is a porn star in a film business owned by Dick Laurent, and is plotting to leave this business and run away. But before doing that, she wants to steal money from Andy, an associate of Dick. So she found Pete the innocent youngster (19 yrs) who would assist her in her plot. She leaves the backdoor open while she is having sex with Andy to let Pete sneak in and hit Andy. Pete hits Andy and Alice steals the money. But Andy wakes up only to fall on the edge of a coffee table and gets killed. They run away and get married and Alice dies her hair black. But they are pursued by Dick Laurent who fancies Alice and cannot let go. Alice and Pete now married have an average suburban house and change their names to Fred Madison and Renee Madison. A few years later, Dick finds out about them and threatens them, so Alice (now Renee) agrees to renew her relationship with Dick and sleeps with him at Lost Highway Motel. Eventually, she plots with Pete (now Fred) to kill Dick when Dick falls asleep after having sex with her. Pete (Fred) now in his mid-twenties, waits in the dark for his wife to leave the motel and sneaks in and kidnaps Dick and drives him to a desert cabin and kills him. He returns home and even before getting in he informs Alice that Dick is dead.   From then on, Alice (Renee) who always had a penchant for criminal thinking leads a normal life, and Pete (Fred) who was an innocent youngman cannot escape the nightmares of the murders he committed because he loves Alice (Renee). He has frequent nightmares and he suspects that his wife who was a porn star and who had sex with anyone to get what she wanted fast, is infidel to him with anyone anytime. Driven by his deteriorating psychological condition, he murders her one night. The police investigates and arrest him, and he is sentenced to death by electric execution. During the execution, his mind is revealing falshes of his memories about what happened.     THE PLOT  The plot is an artistic representation of the narrative. The film starts at a point where the tension between Pete and Alice is highest, and thirty minutes or so Pete kills Alice and is sentenced to death. He is now waiting execution in a prison cell and when is taken to be electrocuted, all the other events start flashing in his head, starting with his life as a 19 year old working as a mechanic and dating Sheila, and so on. All the other elements that are not directly part of the plot are there to improve the artistic presentation and to add style. For example, the strange man with the weird face is Pete's evil sub-conscious reminding him all the time about the murders he committed. There are moments when David Lynch gives away signales, for example when this strange man tells Pete/Fred that her real name was not Alice, or the photo when Alice and Renee show up only to have only Renee left after Andy is killed. Which means that Alice will now run away and use another name.     Now reviewers can watch the movie and enjoy it as I did. It is a piece of art.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I bought this on a lark... I knew a couple of their songs and figured that, for this price, it was worth checking them out. A few viewings later, and I'm hooked, and I'm a big Killers fan.  God, these guys can write songs, and they really do create a different atmosphere song-by-song during the show.  Very powerful live presence.<br /><br />And, let's face it, Brandon Flowers is most of the show, and the guitarist is probably a good songwriter but not a great musician, and that's just the state of the band.  I'd love to see them with a more confident and powerful guitarist, and it would bring them up to the next level to have that, but even without that this is an amazing show.  Interesting that both Maroon 5 and The Killers are getting it done without a great guitarist these days....<br /><br />Anyway, I've been watching and listening to this disc every day for a week or so, can't get the songs out of my head, it's so worth buying, cheaper than a concert ticket and a better view.  And, of course, you want the Blu-Ray disc with DTS-HD Master Audio, and you want an amplifier that's capable of delivering the flawless sound contained on that audio track.
B002ZG9800|5.0|I tend to underestimate Jim Carrey and then I see him in one of his better movies and realize what a serious mistake it was to do so.  Typically I've been thinking of him as \\"just a comic\\" and not an actor.  He is really a superb actor who is also a very funny comic.<br /><br />I normally adore Ewan McGregor and he is just fine here.  However, Carrey is just fantastic.  I did not realize this was based on a real life con man until the end of the film.  I thought it was fictional.  The plot is Carrey as con man supreme who falls in love with McGregor when they are in prison together.  The only problem is that Carrey can't stop himself from continuing his cons. The cons are terrically entertaining.<br /><br />This is a dramedy, a comedy mixed with drama.  It really works as both and I would not want one to dominate the other.  As it is, a perfect blend is achieved.<br /><br />These two do an absolutely superb job of playing gay men.  I've seen a lot of films about gay men but never one like this.  By having two major film actors play gay men in love, there are nuances and depths which are brought forth in this film which I don't think have ever been seen before.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Great album! Received my item in a very quick fashion. I was very impressed with everything.[[ASIN:B0032Y8XH8 Sigh No More]]
B003O86CJS|4.0|There are a ton of great songs on this album - I'm very pleased.  And I was lucky enough to get one of the cotton candy scented ones - yum!  The smell is pretty faint, so I don't reckon it will last very long, but it reminds me of my Strawberry Shortcake doll from when I was a kid.<br /><br />My one bone of contention is that I think it is pretty tacky that I had to pay more for the \\"Clean\\" version versus the \\"Explicit\\" version?  I almost didn't buy the album because of this, but in the end, I'm sure Katy Perry doesn't have anything to do with how her albums are priced.
0143118420|1.0|This was one of many books I picked up to read this summer,it was also the only one I put down after 50 pages. I can usually read anything and finish everything so I decided to pick it up again, boy is it a painful read.   Her lack of awareness to the world around her made me cringe, as she was the \\"ugly american\\" tourist you hear about.    How they allowed her into the ashram was beyond me. Probably through the publishing house connections I imagine. I feel sorry for the serious people who were there during her stay. I would love to read a book about their experience with her there! UGH!  I found it shameful that she admits to being there talking too much, gossiping and having a cocktail party vibe around her.      I kept thinking she had a big $$$ advance on the book, so after her hours of \\"meditation\\" would she run to her room and write about her day and the people around her?  Not a way to find God if you are taking breaks thinking about what you need to write about...maybe thats what she was meditating on...    I really wanted to like this book. My 19 year old daughter skipped the book and saw the movie, she was also not impressed.     It reminds me of the bestselling book that Oprah also promoted where the writer (recovering drug addict) turned out to be a sham of some sort. Can't even remember the books title now.

HIghly recommended for everyone, young and old. I felt so young at heart and almost silly after reading it in a much-too-quick  hour.
B003IGMJ34|5.0|While the previous import version had several bonus tracks, this new version has had a massive sonic upgrade.  Most hard rock fans probably don't realize what a huge force the Scorpions already were by the early '70s.  With the twin guitar work of Uli John Roth and Rudy Schenker, they had a sound way ahead of its time.  Though, the production work on the records matched the times and there was certainly a lot of his.  Well, no longer.  Though these recordings are far from cheap, for real fans of the Scorpions and hard rock from the '70s, take the plunge!!!!!!

0596805888|5.0|Reading this book is like listening to an old friend who has taken an interest in cooking and is trying to convey his knowledge to you, his good old friend, because he has learned some best practices he would like to share. It's an interesting journey about temperatures, melting points, chemical reactions and what not, it's all in there. One of the main lessons is; \\"Have fun! Learning is about curiosity, not work,\\" which should not only appeal to us geeks, but to people, eager to learn, in general. Another great lesson \\"Don't be afraid to burn your dinner!\\"... In our daily routine, don't be afraid to make mistakes! That's the only way you'll learn what NOT to do. Life lessons.    Cooking is all about time and temperature, chemistry and flavor, smelling and tasting and you can experiment right in your own kitchen. Sometimes the result of the experiment is even edible, now isn't that cool! In what other cooking book can you read sentences like this: \\"buttermilk has a pH of 4.4-4.8, while regular milk has a pH of ~6.7, so it follows that baking soda will buffer and neutralize the more acidic buttermilk,\\" not in my moms!     The book is littered with jokes and references to our geeky-jobs, like RTFR (last R being the \\"recipe\\", you know the other letters in this acronym ;-) Or making 'subclasses' of a sauce, and trying various 'instances'... You know exactly where to place these kind of sentences. Brilliant stuff! Apart from that this book is very complete. It covers setting up your kitchen and tools, talks about the various flavors and to smell and taste food, has great interviews with people with various types of relation to cooking or food and is packed with great recipes and ideas. I bet not only geeks have found its contents invaluable and a must read for everyone who regularly has to turn on the stove or oven!    Great job to Jeff and his team! I wonder what other subjects he and the team could geekify! These could turn out to be much more interesting than the \\"ForDummies\\" books!    P.S. One thing I haven't found yet in the book... How to best clean my burned pan!

0439023483|5.0|The first chapter wasn't an immediate hook, but it wasn't long before I was deeply invested in the characters (my number one demand from a novel). Collins does a fine job of creating well-rounded, consistent characters in this dystopian novel. Did I say consistent? Absolutely. Too many novels fall apart on that point. This one doesn't. Life in the Seam is so well described that the pages actually feel gray and drab. When Prim is selected for the Hunger Games, I could sense Katniss's panic and helplessness.<br /><br />Collins relies a bit much on flashback in the beginning to create the back stories, but it soon sticks to the present moment and kept me reading each word. Her pace unfolds at a leisurely pace, sometimes feeling a tad slow but always picking back up. I thought the writing would've benefited from occasional section breaks to enhance the passage of time.<br /><br />The world of the Hunger Games is, to say the least, surreal; at times it comes off as one big game show, like The Running Man. But I never had problems with my suspension of disbelief. The tracker jackers, mockingjays, and the loathsome nature of the Capitol seemed fitting (and in a nightmarish way, plausible). The only time I felt there was a bit of a stretch was the wolf-creatures that were apparently mutations of the other tributes. That seemed unnecessary, and a bit corny. Maybe it plays into book 2, but rabid wolf-creatures would've been enough.<br /><br />I was satisfied with the end. It wasn't great, wasn't a let down. No big resolution, but at least there wasn't a cliff-hanger (which I despise).<br /><br />Best book I've read in 2010. Looking forward to book 2.
0399536108|5.0|You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to. That's at the heart of Chris Guillebeau's message in his debut book, The Art of Non-Conformity. Chris is leading the charge with his own brand of social entrepreneurship and lifestyle design, encouraging readers - what he calls his small army - to embrace \\"convergence\\" - living the abundant life you want while simultaneously making a lasting difference in the world.     That's what sets this book apart from others in the \\"self-help/career\\" genre. The Art of Non-Conformity isn't about \\"working less, playing more, getting rich and retiring early\\". Instead, the AONC challenge is to make the most of every minute of every day of your life, creating a legacy that will long outlast you. That's exactly what reading this book has inspired me to do. I am pursuing a life on my own terms and am determined to change my small corner of the world while doing it.    And Chris walks the walk. Not only has his online writing inspired thousands of people to make big changes toward unconventional living, his first book will be used to change the world - literally. If you buy this book,  20% of the author royalties will go directly to support Charity: Water (an additional 80% if you buy Chris' book on his \\"Unconventional Book Tour\\").     Chris is known for including a \\"Free Prize\\" with his online writing. He doesn't disappoint here, including a long list of \\"Online Resources\\" on his website for readers who want to go deeper with the book's ideas.    Bottom line -- this book is a must-read for ANYONE who wants to challenge the status quo and live an abundant life.
0439023513|5.0|It was a great conclusion to the trilogy and I had a hard time putting the book down.  It was adventurous, romantic, sad, sweet, and fanciful.  While I wasn't in love with all the characters, I definitely felt connected to them.  And although it had a great ending, it was a sad reminder that sometimes we can't fight the inevitable but taking courage in ourselves and standing up for what is right can make a difference in this world.
044024367X|2.0|Sorry- once I saw where the story was headed I had to flip through pages to the ending. I wanted a thriller & to be fascinated with the story but, I just don't believe that someone like Jack Reacher has such a whiny liberal point of view.   When are the idiots in Hollywood & everyone in the entertainment industry going to realize- we just want to be entertained- do not preach politics at us. Big turn off. I have read all the Reacher novels in order so far & loved them all- - until now. I hope the next one is better without all the \\"preachy drama.\\" It's one thing to be a veteran and anti-war but pleaaaze-this is not the Jack Reacher I have come to know & love. Tone it down a notch. Believe me, like another reviewer said- war-hating  liberals are not the target audience for Jack Reacher novels- and if they become so- I probably won't be reading them anymore.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|I really do love all the seasons (I purchased all 4 seasons from Amazon.com) and was saddened when they were canceled after 4 seasons.  The writers did an awesome job with the last show of the series.  Ugly Betty was a terrific show with terrific actors and writers.  Good Bye Betty -- I'm going to miss you, your family, friends and enemies. =(
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I bought this for my 8 & 10 year old boys who are Star Wars and Clone Wars fanatics.  It has been wonderful for them and they said it was the best gift they'd received in years (well, atleast since Christmas).  I personally don't care for the Clone Wars, but they love it, and considering some of the other stuff kids watch lately, I'm alright with it.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|It's clear that war is a brutal and horrible thing. I am just not sure that it's a good use of my entertainment time to watch soldier after soldier stare off into the distance and see how he's clearly dehumanized as a result of war, emotionally scarred and likely to do something reflective as such on screen.    Not to mention that the pacing is really strange (Melbourne ep, Lecky recuperating etc...), I actually found myself fast forwarding (PVR) on multiple occasions to get to something interesting.    I loved Band of Brothers but this is a shadow of that effort.
0307463745|3.0|If you want a quick read that confirms what you think a fairytale workday should be, then buy this book. It helps keep things in perspective instead of getting caught up in the details. But, if you're looking for an in-depth book with insights and true-life examples from other companies (instead of just 37signals) then don't purchase this book -- or just purchase a used one for less.<br /><br />I found this book fine for a time filler. But if I really wanted to learn more about being a successful entrepreneur (or, \\"starter\\" as this book calls us), then I would have preferred a more intelligent book. By \\"intelligent,\\" I mean something that peaks my interest beyond the pages.
0596806027|5.0|Normally, I would jump straight to the code section and pass off the rest as fluff. I'm a meat and potatoes man! Just gimme the code and I'm good to go. But as I started to peruse the intro I found myself engaged and curious for more. I knew a brief history of HTML and that was good enough, at least, I thought. I continue to read on and found the history of Internet markup (HTML) really interesting and helpful in understanding \\"why\\" we needed an overhaul. Sure you can skip all the background hoopla and go straight to all the code, but then why buy this book? You can get HTML5 reference on the Internet for free... very technical, and in the rough, but its all there as it unfolds.<br /><br />No, I really like how Mark Pilgrim blended the history (the why) with the now (the result). It makes learning the new stuff fun because now you have a deeper understanding of why certain things were implemented into HTML5 and others not right now. Instead of complaining about a feature you now say \\"Ahaa\\". This combination in my humble opinion makes this book about this emerging technology, timeless. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to get a jump start on this very well thought out, ready-to-use-now mark up language, HTML5. You'll get the \\"why\\", and the \\"how\\" right now so you don't have to play catch up later.
0553805371|5.0|This is a great sequel to the 2001 bestseller \\"The Universe In A Nutshell\\" by Stephen Hawking titled \\"Grand Design\\". Stephen Hawking expands/solidifies & summarises where he left of in his previous book \\"The Universe In A Nutshell\\" on the \\"Theory Of Everything\\" (ToE) also known as the M-Theory to explain the existence of life, the Universe & everything (what he calls 'The Ultimate Question of Being') : the Universe was created by gravity from nothing (spontaneous creation) [The total energy of the Universe is Zero], and thus \\"God didn't create the Universe\\", he argues.    Gravity in the form of curved space permeates the whole bulk of higher-dimensional space-time. The M-Theory suggests there are 11 space-time dimensions & not 10 : these are very small & their numbers may be more. The Brane world is a four-dimensional surface & brane itself with 11 dimensional space-time. The Uncertainity Principle would allow spontaneous world to appear from nothing like bubbles, with brane forming the surface of the bubble & the interior being the 11 dimensional space-time due to gravity.    The discovery of \\"new planets\\" since 1992 suggests the existence of \\"multiverses\\" (not just our own Universe) and that our planet may not be unique as against what Isaac Newton alluded to a very long time ago. But not everybody agrees with Stephen Hawking on \\"God didn't create the Universe\\" theory, even at his own University of Cambridge : Religious groups argue that Science may provide the narrative on how existence may occur, but religion addresses the meaning of that narrative!    \\"Grand Design\\" book is a very interesting book, will be controversial in some religious circles, but is a good summary of the current status of scientific knowledge in the quest for the origin of the Universe & its complexities, highly recommended reading. The book is well written in simple language for the general public, humerous way in some areas & is well illustrated : no wonder Stephen Hawking is an academiccelebrity!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I've seen the original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN several times and it never fails to leave me uneasy, an other worldly masterpiece of  film making excellence. Everything about this was just about perfect. Much like the book, full of character studies and a slow paced winter dream. Having watched the new remake LET ME IN, I still can say this also is a wonderful journey into a macabre story that takes hold and never lets up. Closely following the original but with a bolder choice of settings, music and actors, LET ME IN will take you under its spell, its beautifully filmed, a love story of some sorts but a terrifying tale. This film takes out much of the \\"other\\" plots in the book and original and focuses all the energy on the young troubled boy and the girl and her caretaker that moves next door. Can't leave out the wonderful police detective as well!  I felt the acting and unusual story  make this remake a step above your usual vampire lore but I still will never get the original out of my head. One quirk that should have been much better was the special effects of the vampire but that is its only flaw.  Both of these gems have their own special creep factor and cinematography chill and  should both be scene for what the directors have created.  All the acting put this one way over the top in quality, a classic on my movie shelf.

B0040YFR1Y|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie, but this is not a good \\"predator\\" movie.  In my opinion, it is even worse than the first A VS P movie.  Where to begin?  In terms of proper editing, there is one scene where one of the humans gets one of his legs trapped in a bear trap, and thus cannot walk or even stand-up.  However, in the next scene with him, he is standing-up AND walking without feeling any pain at all!  Then there is the brilliant plan of standing in one spot and waiting for the predators (who can see in heat vision, have laser cannons, and can cloak) to come and somehow kill them in the crossfire.  That is the dumbest plan I ever heard!  Also, early on in the movie, the main character finds out that predators cannot see humans if they are covered in mud.  However, none of the humans put any mud on themselves until the very end of the movie!  Also, Mr. Fishburne's character was a joke.  There is no way that a human could even wear a predator's outfit, much less cloak in it.  The humans were the stars of this film (if you can call them \\"stars\\") and sadly, the super predators all die in the dumbest ways.  I won't spoil the ways they die (they are killed in the most generic action-movie ways), but none of them lasted that long when the final fights started.  The samurai-esque scene was really dumb.  A super predator should be able to kill humans easily and should be much smarter than a classic predator (according to Mr. Fishburne's character in the movie).  However, a super predator falls for the exact same trap it set-up for the humans earlier.  How is that smarter?  In Predator, the predator was much smarter.  Also, the idea of heading into the predators' main base was not a very good plan at all.  The humans are supposed to be the toughest guys from Earth, yet even in the beginning of the movie, the Russian guy doesn't even know how to properly reload his chain gun!  How are we supposed to believe that he is one of the toughest guys from Earth if he cannot even reload his gun properly?  Then there is the last fight, which suffers from a really bad second-wind Hollywood ending that is completely illogical.  The final super predator doesn't even take its mask and laser cannon off.  In fact, you only see a super predator's face for about 5-10 seconds in the entire movie.  Oh, and a classic predator in this movie cannot even break 1 chain that has him tied up.  In the first Predator movie, the predator definitely would have been able to break this (he did lift up a huge piece of wood that landed directly on his head).  The romance in this movie also was forced.  I do not think that a \\"predator\\" movie should even have a romance in it, it should be just action.  The 1st predator movie didn't have a romance in it.  Mr. Brody, who stars at the main character in this film, does not look like a leader.  He comes up with dumb plans and he doesn't look that tough either, yet he manages to beat up a super predator much more savagely than Arnold hurt the classic predator in the 1st movie.  If you are going to have a tough guy as the lead character, he needs to look super-tough.  This guy looked like a whimp.  If they wanted to avoid having a character that looked like Arnold, they should've had someone that tries to outsmart the super predators in a believable way.  I was really angry when the movie ended because it was a total waste of money to watch it.  The final nail in the coffin was the Hollwyood second-wind part of the end fight.  I wouldn't even recommending renting this movie.  It stains the Predator movie series' name much, much worse than A VS P did.  If you absolutely must see this movie because it has predators in it, watch it at a friend's house.  This way, you can see this horrible movie without having to pay for renting it (assuming of course that your friend pays for the rental).  This movie is so bad that I will never watch it again.  They should make a Predator 3 movie that completely ignores thisone (like Predators ignores Predator 2).

B002XTBE6K|5.0|The previous two versions of Emma (Gwenyth Paltrow and Kate Bekinsale) left me completely frustrated with the character. Romola Garai has created an Emma that is likable, maybe even lovable. Her character flaws are depicted as symptoms of her unworldliness and loneliness due to her father's terror of the outside.     The other character stories are fully developed, so the focus is not on Emma alone.      My one objection would be the casting of Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston. She and Romola Garai played romantic rivals in \\"Daniel Deronda,\\" (another Masterpiece, literally) and here she depicts Emma's governess. They are but 7 years apart in real life - she should not be playing matronly figures just yet.     The screenplay is superb, the directing divine. Charming adaptation!
B002S0OBN2|4.0|I recently had the occasion to be in London.  My priority was to go see Love Never Dies.  After finding the theater, and purchasing my tickets ( at a better rate than the tickets booths!) the show began.. The play beautifully tells the tale of what happened to the Phantom and the other principals.  I was unsure for a long while that Andrew Lloyd Weber would be able to recreate the magic of Phantom, but slowly and surely he did.  While Love Never Dies is not the wonderful song, after song, after song that Phantom of the Opera is. the wonderful songs are there.  Until I Hear You Sing, is the money song in my opinion.  I can listen to it for hours, and Rami who sings the role is a quintiessential Phantom.  After I returned home, and listened to the CD, it was able to bring back all the feelings that seeing the show   did.  For this reason, I recommend anyone with interest, to add Love Never Dies to their collection.
0399536108|5.0|I was a fan of Chris before the book. I'm not sure what the next level of \\"fan-dom\\" is, but I guess you could call me that now.<br /><br />Unlike other ones I've seen, AONC isn't just a \\"blog-to-book\\" book. It's a whole other animal. Chris gets much more personal in this book, talking about his story more in depth than I've heard/read anywhere else. It's an engaging read (finished it in 2 sessions) profiling his life as well as that of other non-conformists.<br /><br />If you like Chris, living unconventionally, thinking outside of the box and \\"non-conforming\\" to the system, you'll love this book. If you're intrigued by any of that, you'll love the book. If you're okay with living comfortably and don't want your world rocked, stay far far away from this book, cause it will do just that.
0380018179|3.0|This is my kind of book: an epic family saga with a strong sense of place. I hate to give it only three stars, but I've had to conclude that while it has its strengths, it doesn't live up to what it could have been.<br /><br />The Thorn Birds starts off excellently, detailing the day-to-day life of a family struggling to get by in early twentieth century New Zealand. It's well-written, it feels very realistic, and there's a strong sense of place. There's believable conflict among the family members without any of them being unsympathetic. There's an interesting and unflinching look at the effects of strict gender roles on average women's lives: something we don't see in most historical fiction, which tends to feature the elite rather than regular folks. (I'll read about the regular folks any day, and McCullough does it well.) When the family picks up and moves to Australia, I was still enthralled. I loved the descriptions of life in the Outback and was drawn into the family's story.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way though, things went wrong. The characters' personalities and relationships began to lose credibility with me; several times I just couldn't swallow that people in these situations would relate to each other the way they do. Meggie's relationships with both her mother and her daughter are especially bizarre, full of contrived antagonism far beyond what one would expect. (In the daughter's case, evidently she dislikes Meggie from birth. Ooookay.) Some of the more colorful personalities, such as Frank and Luke, disappear partway through, while Meggie's tribe of brothers lose what personality they once had and slowly merge into one person, as if McCullough changed her mind about how many brothers the story required but couldn't be bothered to get rid of the extras. As for the romance between Meggie and Ralph, while at first it raised some interesting questions, it never captured my emotions and becomes increasingly repetitive.<br /><br />Which is not to say that this is an awful book, because it isn't. It's well-written and the thematics are strong. The strong descriptions and the sense of place persist throughout, and it's fascinating to see how the coming of new technology affects the Outback. The main characters are decently well-developed, and while the book is long, the plot remains interesting. I finished it in a few days. Still, if you have not yet read the classic historical epics, like Isabel Allende's House of the Spirits or Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, I'd recommend going with those first.that this is an awful book, because it isn't.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.  If you have not read Hunger Games (book 1) yet then do not read this review as it will contain spoilers.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is 16yrs old and has just survived the 74th annual Hunger Games in Panem.  She and Peeta, her partner from district 12, became the first ever couple to win and in doing so have upset the balance of a very unstable government.  Their final act in the Hunger Games has been viewed as rebellion by the other districts and has led to many whisperings of uprisings and all out rebelling against the suffocating government that is keeping them all in a constant state of ecomonic depression.<br /><br />Katniss is now faced with many decisions.  She and Peeta have to convince the world they are truly in love and in order to do so the president wants a wedding... soon.  But she is torn because of the feelings she might have for Gale.  She also has the Quarter Quell coming up, the 75th annual Hunger Games.  Now that she and Peeta are victors they will become mentors to the next 2 Tributes from District 12 and that may be even harder for her than when she was in the games fighting for her life.<br /><br />Following along in the same fashion as book one, Catching Fire is a fabulous dystopian novel that follows one of my favorite protagonists, Katniss.  There are few characters from novels that I enjoy as thoroughly as I do Katniss, one of my other favorites is Jace from the Mortal Instruments series.  Throughout these novels there is such an intensity and urgency in all of the decisions and actions that can be felt through the pages.  I couldn't wait to pick this back up again to continue reading!  This is a series that is high on my list of favorites and will definitely be on my reading list every year!<br /><br />As I said with The Hunger Games, this series is not for everyone.  It can be very dark and is about subjects that can be tough for more sensitive people to read.  People are put into an arena and told to kill or be killed in order to win a game that the rich find entertaining.  I highly recommend this series but have also had friends that have not been able to handle them and didn't like them much at all.  They found it a bit too dark for their tastes.

B003Q7B78S|5.0|This film puts me in a trance outside of time and everything familiar, and it feels incredible. I have watched this movie more than any other movie and it never gets old. I saw it 15+ times in the theater and watched it many more times on DVD. Saying that, it is still hard to describe this movie. Visually STUNNING, from start to finish each scene is a visual masterpiece, a work of art.  The soundtrack and music compliments the visuals perfectly, and the song of the closing scene is moving and inspirational. There are amazing observations on the human condition, romance, love, death and POETRY, and it still leaves a sense of mystery.  This movie has made me a lifelong die-hard fan of Tilda Swinton. Did I mention I Love this movie?
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Best show ever. Watched 1-7 on Netflix and Season 8 here. Amazon has good quality, fast loading. Just wished it left off at the last episode I watched, or had some indication for me.

B002ZG98CS|2.0|WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS.<br /><br />Yes, that's right. Aside from Inception and/or The Wolfman, I literally can't remember the last time I gave a movie on here 5 stars. OK maybe with The Wolfman I was being a tad generous, but OK let's move on.<br /><br />I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here: Did you REALLY like this movie, or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too, in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of b-movies. They know how to make a good b-movie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds, with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things \\"Visually gorgeous\\", Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance, they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.<br /><br />I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After \\"Hobo With A Shotgun\\", \\"Machete\\" showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.<br /><br />Turns out, some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it, and don't take themselves too seriously, and for that, come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its \\"Don't take yourself too seriously\\" rule? Well, it did... for the first 20 minutes.<br /><br />I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound, I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course, we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.<br /><br />First off, Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of \\"Robin Hood\\" of earlier this year (you know what scene I'm talking about). Second, this film has too much plot in it, and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a b-flick, this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. \\"She\\" is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has (what feels like) 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet, what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal, who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time, De Niro, or Fahey, who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there, other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all, it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.<br /><br />By the time the film was done, I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action b-flick, there's about 10 minutes of action, 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a b-movie, not some political crap. I like slow paced films, but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.<br /><br />Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.    Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|A major disappointment.  The ending seems rushed and cobbled together.  WARNING: Possible Spoiler Ahead.  The climactic scene becomes a mere afterthought when the results of that scene had significant ramifications for all of Panem and the protagonist, Katniss.  Yet the author explains everything away in just a few paragraphs. The description of Katniss' life after the climax is summarized and incongruent, as if the author had a deadline to meet, or had only so many pages with which to fit it all in.    But the ending wasn't the only problem I had with this book.  Katniss spends way too much time throughout the novel a)kicking and screaming while being hauled off to be sedated, b) under the influence of \\"morphling,\\" which the author conveniently uses as a device to ignore whole parts of the story, and c) contemplating her love triangle (by the end I was hoping both beaus would be killed off just to stop it.  Instead, the author, again, summarizes the fate of both Peeta, and especially Gale, with few words).    I had high hopes, but Mockingjay left me feeling like a good story had been stolen from me.
0470601787|4.0|This book is a good buy and can lead to the development of worthwhile meetings and the development of group dynamics which in turn can lead to change. The ideas of visual presentation of concept and data and using them to create insights of structure and the processes that can flow from that are gaining momentum (cf [[ASIN:1591843065 The Back of the Napkin (Expanded Edition): Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures]]and [[ASIN:0393072959 The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics: The Dos and Don'ts of Presenting Data, Facts, and Figures]]. I cannot help but applaud the author for putting this book together and attempting to educate conference presenters and team leaders to create dynamic audio visual presentations without complex technology. As an inveterate drawer and graphic presenter, I could understand what was presented and could gain new insights and ideas for the future. The book certainly is worthy of the reviews already received.<br /><br />But I do have a caveat which leads me to give less than a five star rating. It is this.  To what extent will people who do not naturally think in this mode be able to adopt these methods? I appreciate the author's knowledge and experience and his belief that everybody can draw and can develop skills. Even if that is so, however, in order to develop the plethora of skills and techniques in this book and to use them dynamically, will take enormous work and dedication. This book is excellent, but it is not an easy fix for the management and development of small group and large group development and creative settings. My advice would be to look at it carefully if you think you need to develop such skills from scratch, unless you are willing really to work hard at skill development. If you believe you already have some degree of skill, however, this book can be a revelation.
0399536108|5.0|I am a new member of Chris Guillebeau's army, having just recently stumbled onto his website and learned of his philosophy, his ideas and his book.  Through reading his book, I got to know Chris as a person, rounding out and deepening the essence of his message as I knew it through his blog and website.  He is the real deal.  This is a man who is driven to change the world in his own way, by living his life unconventionally, and on his own terms, and the best part is that what he has done and continues to do can be done by anyone.  He challenges, and asks the reader to challenge, typical  notions and beliefs about life and work and the balance and meaning of the two.  He shows how he has accomplished this, and made a living doing it, and encourages others to find that place where they can break from a mold and find their own path.      I actually had to put the book down a few times when what I read struck a \\"whoa!\\" moment.  So simple, the ideas.  So true and affirming to those of us who dream for a different life for ourselves, our families, and the world.  Read the story of the five monkeys in a cage on page 16 and have a \\"whoa!\\" moment of your own.    What is most impactful is that Chris moves us to see the world as a place to enjoy and experience, to live on our own terms, and urges that without service to others, all of this will fall flat.  He calls for us to \\"...(get) what you really want while also helping others in a unique way\\", and defines world domination as \\"...where you live a life of adventure and focus on leaving a legacy that makes a radical difference for other people.\\"  The book contains practical ideas to accomplish this, and left me thinking of ways in which I can change my life and create a better world.

B002ZG97E2|5.0|I saw this in the theatre, and loved every second of it. The story is very original, and does not steal from Disney films, as most animated features seem to do nowadays. I laughed, I cried, I had butterflies in my stomach for a week after seeing this! Most definitely for the villian fans!
B0000C9JFO|3.0|The storyline is nostalgic, a student apparently without means finds a way to move to Spain for study and lodges with co-transplanted students from the UK and France, the student Romain Duris is dull and unlikable,but the other player, especially Kelly Reilly and Cecile de France are a lot of fun to watch.  Overall the movie is quite enjoyable and unfortunately Romain Duris makes it look too French, it would have been better to have replaced him with a better actor like Daniel Auteuil.  This is why I only give it 3 stars instead of five.

0439023513|1.0|(Spoiler alert)I just finished reading Mockingjay and had to write a review because I am floored at how bad this book is considering I absolutely loved the first two books in the series. I understand that war is not fun and that this series is not Harry Potter, but I never expected this book to be so dark and well, just flat out not fun. The first two books were serious, but action packed and had a certain momentum that kept the pages turning much the same way the Harry Potter series did. But this book is so far different in tone from the other two novels in the series that it's really shocking. There is no momentum whatsoever and there were substantial portions of this book that I started to skim out of sheer boredom, which never happened when I read the first two novels. This book is so strange that the only thing I can really compare it to is the movie Apocalypse Now because it is such a pyschological nightmare and of course the theme in both is that war is hell (\\"the horror, the horror\\"). The only difference is that I loved Apocalypse now, but Mockingjay is one of the worst novels (and sequels) that I have ever read. The things Katniss has to endure in this book (district 13 basically as bad as the capital, Peta becoming crazy, her sister being killed in the end, Katniss being burned basically from head to toe) is just flat out brutal. I guess I am naive because I expected this book to be kind of Star Warsish with the districts (the rebels) taking on and beating the evil capital in a thrilling conclusion. I figured Gale or Peta would die heroically and Katniss would live happily ever after with the survivor. But instead Katniss ends up broken both mentally and physically. I assume the author was not satisfied with writing something that was just a fun piece of popular fiction (like the Harry Potter series) and instead wanted something that would be remembered with the great works of literature (1984, Brave New World, Ender's Game, etc), but if that was the attempt then she has failed miserably. All I can really say in conclusion is that like a lot of people who loved the first two books in the series and I had very high hopes for Mockingjay, but in the end it is one of the most bizzarre, truly ugly novels I have ever read. It is so bad in fact that it will forever cloud my opinion of the series as a whole.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|Rome was a great series to watch. The story, settings, feel of it was just amazing. My only knock on it would be the 2nd season. After watching the first season, I was so excited to see the second. While watching the second, I felt as though the season was rushed (I guess because they knew it was the last season and had to get all of that into 1). Other than that, the series is amazing.
0439023513|3.0|I was fully prepared to rave about 'Mockingjay,' the last book of the Hunger Games series. I was ready to love it as much as I did the first two, and to channel that love into words of high praise. So imagine my surprise when I finished the book and was left with an unexpected feeling: disappointment.<br /><br />I got a sense while reading the book that Suzanne Collins was making an attempt to create a big finish ending, which is another strange thing, because I felt like 'Mockingjay' was a smaller story than the first two books. It's less focused and more generalized. Much of the action happens \\"off-stage,\\" and the main characters (Katniss Everdeen in particular) are far less interesting than they were in earlier installments. Where the first two books packed a big punch, this one is weak...perhaps staggering under its own weight.<br /><br />Not that it's entirely a bad book. There are scenes in the early pages that hearken back to Collins' strongest points as a storyteller. The first quarter or so of the book reads much like 'Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' and almost captures that same excitement and razor's-edge suspense. Though it falters after that, there are later events and character developments that almost gave me hope again and kept me reading. I did finish the book, and the ending is...satisfactory.  Not excellent, not everything it could have been, but it is a fair ending.<br /><br />A story as good as the Hunger Games deserved far better than \\"fair.\\" The strong start and hard-hitting nature of the early story didn't make it all the way through. In this third book, punches are pulled, opportunities are missed, endings are too easy, and the flame that burned so strongly at the beginning sputters and fails in the end.<br /><br />The Hunger Games are over. All that's left is two excellent books and one fair one, and disappointment in what could have been.

0439023513|2.0|(NO SPOILERS) I loved Hunger Games and I liked Catching Fire...but Mockingjay is a surreal mix of horrific violence, drug-induced psychosis/disconnection, and political scenarios that are too convoluted to be thought-provoking or relevant.<br /><br />To start, I can't imagine this is classified as a Young Adult novel - the mass death scenarios are bloody, cruel, and unrelenting.  As a mother, I found some of the depictions of violence against children to be almost literally vomit-inducing (and one of my favorite shows is Dexter, so I'm not one to shy away from violence).  It is, without a doubt, too emotionally and graphically intense for young readers.  I almost wish I hadn't read some of the scenes myself - they will stay with me for a long time.<br /><br />Second, the highly elaborate, gory and gratuitous deaths presented in the book can only be compared to one of the \\"Saw\\" franchise movies.  Hmm, we haven't yet had the skin melt off of someone entirely, so let's do that.  Next let's trigger a barbed wire death cage, or any of several varieties of airborne poison/acid/drugs.  This all happens not in some game arena, mind you, but on residential city streets as an apparent method of national defense.  Really?  Alarmingly elaborate booby-traps as a defense strategy? I recognize this is science fiction, but even science fiction has limits on absurdity.  These scenarios are absurd.<br /><br />Relatedly, regarding the plot, it is clear that the author glossed over many points integral to the story-line, perhaps because her stronger suit is flowery monologues and dramatically elaborate deaths.  A lot of what could be truly interesting about this novel (political intrigue, rescue, revolt, and national recovery) happens off-screen, while Katniss is recovering from one mental breakdown after another.  Every time she surfaces from her mental fogs, the world has again shifted without description or real explanation.  Frankly, it's lazy writing.<br /><br />In sum, I'm genuinely displeased that I read this novel.  I'm left with nothing but ugly images of violence and a hollow pit in my stomach, and I don't even have the satisfaction of a good plot resolution to make me feel better about it.s novel.

B00337KM2S|5.0|\\"UP IN THE AIR\\" is the film equitant of a large helping of \\"sweet and sour pork\\" - the points and counter-points of the story are symmetrically offset in so many interesting and surprising ways.    The self imposed, seeming simplistic and semi-nomadic life style of the central character Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) may well be the personification of the detachment of the later 20th century, when offered in directed juxtaposition to all of the other characters.   The cold deliberateness of a skilled surgeon allows Bingham to execute his assignments without any concern for the pain his actions cause.   A curious irony plays out when Bingham is effectively \\"hoisted with his own petard\\" as he is made obsolete by his employer's deployment of technology at the same time that he is attempting to \\"settle down\\".    I can't watch this film and not recall when I was fired from my job after many years of service.   While I re-live the hurt, anger and betrayal as it is expressed on screen (coincidentally by actual unemployed people - not actors - who were recruited for the film production); I endorse another point of the film, that: termination can be a \\"rebirth\\" on both a personal and profession levels by providing a change in perspective and a freedom of expression which is often restricted by the standardization of the work environment.    The poignancy of the story may lose its edge, as the economy of 2009 improves - but the central theme of the story is a morality tail of modern life, and will continue to offer inspiration.

030745455X|2.0|The initial offering in this series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was barely good enough to goad me into buying this sequel, but this will not happen for the third book.<br /> Other negative reviews touch on many of the things that I had problems with, but I'll name the things that bothered me off of the top of my head.<br /> The plot was slow developing; it took 250 pages just to get to the point described by the premise on the back cover of the paperback edition. WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL; definitive descriptions of shopping trips to IKEA and convenience stores with a plethora of product placement. Lisbeth Salander, an interesting character from the first book, is now a superwoman, who I never felt was in any danger whatsoever. Blomqvist the male lead is almost as invulnerable, but dull and uninteresting.<br /> All other male characters are either 'good guys' or 'bad guys' depending on their opinion of Salander. The female characters are completely interchangeable(with the exception of over-the-top lesbian Miriam Wu) and I often became confused; often I was thinking that character Erica Berger was Malin Errikson and vice versa.<br /> The bad guys are extremely one dimensional and have no chance against the likes of Salander; when they had her in their clutches with a chance of putting her out of the way permanently, I couldn't help but think of Dr Evil's son in Austin Powers, imploring his dad to just shoot him; if the evil dudes in this book had just shot Salander then, I would boost this rating 1 star.

1416589473|4.0|The book was very well written. It contains mostly back story to account for the ~2 centuries between the original guildwars and guildwars 2. The authors, who also wrote most of the lore for the games did a very good job of intigrating a lot of history prior to GW1, GW1 and beyond into the story line. Only complaint is that there was not as much magic as there is in the game. I was hoping to read many of the spells, shouts, chants, etc. that are used in the game. But overall, it was very good. I can't wait for the next.

B002ZG9846|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was going to be. I thought it was going to be some corny wanna be super hero type teen movie but it was actually a very good action flick because of the great action performance of Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy) and especially Chloe Grace Moeretz (Hit Girl). WOW! Hit girl really made the movie with her amazing fighting and assassination skills so this movie really reminded me alot of Kill bill. So if you liked Kill Bill, you definitely going to like Kick-Ass mostly because of the Hit Girl character. The only thing that dissapoints me about the blu-Ray is that it doesn't have any cool extras or deleted scenes that I could really enjoy but like I mentioned before the movie is still worth the purchase.
0596805888|4.0|I don't really have anything more to say about Cooking For Geeks than what you can already find here: if you want to know more about why recipes and various ingredients work - or not - then this book is for you. The recipes are kind of meh, but that is OK, because everything you learn is still very useful to similar recipes you might like to try. So rather than blow off the experience of using this book on a digital reader, indulge me (I use the book on an iPad):<br /><br />* I really missed the physical experience of having a book to scan through. Cook books are all about flipping through the pages, looking at the pictures, and randomly coming across a recipe you want to try. Having this book on an iPad turned that experience into a serial navigational nightmare. Links to recipes take you to chapter headings about temperatures and leavening, so you have to scroll through multiple pages to find the actual recipe. The recipe for a 'simple cheesburger' links to a page about food borne illnesses!<br /><br />* It is nearly impossible to know where you are in the book - you can go to the table of contents from any page, but you lose context when you do that.<br /><br />* Search is great, unless you are looking for something like tuna - it is amazing how many times the word 'unfortunately' shows up!<br /><br />* I've always wondered what that weird white stuff is that seeps out of salmon, and now I know. But the picture doesn't show up very well, and is pixelated when you magnify it. All the graphics need work for the digital world.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in kitchen chemistry, and perhaps the Kindle experience is better; but get the hard copy.
B0034G4OU4|5.0|The circumstances of the story are interesting and beautifully portrayed, but more important was the message that was communicated, a timeless one. There is something within every human being. Name it what you want (God, Peace, Enlightenment etc.)When it is felt, words fall short. What will lead a person to want to discover this feeling is an intense longing. How this happens for each person is unique and a surprise. Travelling across the world is only one of a wide variety of circumstances. The actors in the story did a good job because I believe that they were able to go little deeper to access their own experiences and feelings about what really matters, and then \\"infuse\\" the script to make it come alive.

0439023513|2.0|Wow. Like many others out here, I wanted to like this book. I had some reservations after Catching Fire, but middle books often lag a little in comparison to their earlier and later counterparts. This book was completely soulless. I am sorry. I know there is a reviewer going around telling everyone who gave the book a 2 that we shouldn't have expected a Disney ending and I am telling you I didn't expect one either. It cannot be denied that there is a stark difference  in the tone and character development between the Hunger Games and Mockingjay. If I didn't know better, I would say someone else wrote Mockingjay.     I am glad that there those who found something uplifting in this book. I didn't. When I think of the difference between the death of Rue and the death of Prim, its like there is no connection between them. Rue was a symbolic version of Prim and what would have happened to her if she had been the one to participate in the Games. You feel her death and Kat's reaction to her death. She is devastated and yet she uses that emotion to continue forward. By the time Prim dies in this book, you no longer care. In fact, the writing is so poor, I wasn't even sure that she was dead. It is like this with all the characters. You no longer care.    What is worse, is that major characters have undergone significant changes. Peeta has become a rabid hater of Katniss. Of course, by the end of the book he goes from wanting to kill her, to living next door to her peacefully, and then on to marriage. What? How did that occur? Was he healed in the Capitol? If so, how? We aren't even told how he survived the final battle in the Capitol. He just appears in 12 six months later as a totally subdued character.     Gale is another person who starts to act out of character. Now, he isn't just a rebel soldier... he is a terrorist willing to kill children to win the war. I mean, setting off a bomb just to get people grouped together so that another bomb can go off and raise the deathtoll... this is textbook Al Qaeda... If Collins is in anyway implying that troops from civilized countries such as the US use this tactic, she is seriously deluded.     Katniss becomes just a shell of her former self. It was like Collins found a pamphlet about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in soldiers and wrote this new Katniss based on the information she found within it. Yes, war is a terrible thing, but so is long term oppression. Is Collins trying to say that political oppression is okay as long as you have just enough food to live and a place to hang your hat? Yes, it would be better if we could all just sit down and negotiate our freedom, but it doesn't work that way.  Personally, I really enjoy mine and am grateful to those who protect it. I found this whole portrayal of military life really insulting. What happened the Kat in the Hunger Games was morally reprehensible because it was forced on her against her will. The decision to fight as a rebel is a choice that she makes on her own.     I could go on and on but I won't. I gave this a 2 because it is readable and I know all fans of the series will want to finish it. Just know that you are not alone if you find it disappointing. I understand from reading the comments that there is a movie version coming and if that is true, I will pass. I think I know what all of this will be turned into once Hollywood gets its hands on this. Sad ending to a great a story.
0399536108|5.0|A simple radical idea. Live life on your own terms and help other people. So simple that the discomfort that idea causes can provoke all kinds of objections. Chris Guillebeau first raised these questions in his Manifesto for World Domination that he published via the Art Of Non-Conformity blog. In the real world that just isn't practical, or possible, or so people said. Determined to travel to every country in the world by the time he's 35 and help along the way, Chris proceeded to demonstrate exactly how possible it is by example. Yes he did. He writes about it, video publishes about it, speaks about it and lives it. Ask Cooper Anderson, or NBC,  or his Tedx audiences, or anyone of his small army. And now he has created a simple radical little book that shows you how he does it.<br /><br />For under ten dollars, you can follow the incredibly determined and gifted Chris Guillebeau as he knocks down every objection to living the life you want with experience backed argument and example. Gatekeepers beware, energy vanquishing vampires lookout. Have a to do list? How about a not to do list? Move away from the \\"Department of No\\" and enter the land of what if, and why not. It's your life after all.<br /><br />Of all the things we generally think we need to live a successful life, having a vision and a task are actually what we really need and the answer to his two original questions: \\"What do you really want to get out of life?\\" and \\"How can you help others in a way that no one else can? \\" These items are at the top of Chris's list for true life design. \\"There is always more than one way to do anything.\\" Whatever your dream may be, why wait, why defer living it? So he walks you through in clear, transparent language. And, Chris poses another radical idea, why wait to consider your legacy? Why not spend time on something that important now?<br /><br />Both a dreamer and a realist, Chris offers his tried and true ways to get where we decide to go. Deciding where that is, well that's up to you.<br /><br />Scary? Yes. It always is when we contemplate the unconventional.<br /><br />But isn't that the fun of it too?<br /><br />And here, here's the handbook. And the why. And some pretty fantastic resources to help you tweak a little, or a lot, from a guy who does it everyday  around the world and from his home base in Portland with his wife.

Why was it translated into English when you could just as easily grab a Clive Cussler and find the same set of characters: a protagonist who, besides his day job, is mostly moderate in every way and the objectified, horribly-portrayed cast of disposable female characters?<br /><br />Plainly said: it's airport garbage fiction.
0143038419|4.0|This is a very thought provoking book, it makes you think about how all this relates to you own life; thoughts and views. Though I don't necessarily agree with her method of finding herself it does sound like a grand adventure. For one who may never have the fortune to have her experience she articulates very nicely the areas one might question most. She is fearless in her travel adventures, I admire that for sure. I have tried on occasion to stop talking (long story) it's difficult. Though there have many weekends in which I get no phone calls and do not leave my home and the only words I utter are in prayer, I am always amazed at how full and complete I feel at the end of one of them. One of my take-aways from this book would be \\"...one must always be prepared for riotous and endless waves of transformation.\\" (pg. 75) and \\"This is perfect, this is perfect, if you take the perfect from the perfect, the perfect remains.\\" (pg.120) and \\"Everybody has a different sense of urgency in this life.\\" (pg. 319).    I hope your journey as you share hers is as enjoyable as mine has been.
0452289963|5.0|I have read a ton of books and no book had as practical effect on my life as this one; it literally changed my life.    You may want to skip the first chapter and read it last; it is a bit hard to get but starting with chapter 2, the book becomes a great read.    You will see so much of yourself and the people you know in this book when you read about people's egos and \\"pain bodies\\" left over from previous experiences.    If you practice being in the present and not letting the past and the future control you and you work on quieting that darned voice in your head...your life will change immediately.    Get this book.  Read it. Tolle will change you for the better!

0765326353|5.0|At 1k pages I was a little apprehensive to dive into a book like this.  I am very glad I made the plunge after completing this latest work from Mr. Sanderson.  My impression while reading the book was that it felt like A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin but with a magic system.  Im not saying anything was taken from it but it had the same kind of feel to it which is a good things.  Brandon Sanderson creates a very diverse world that is deep in religion, ethnic differences, history, magic, and even their own traditions.  The more I read the more I appreciate authors that spend time on their characters and the world to create depth.  This is one of the shining features that The way of kings does.  This is supposed to be the first of 10 books that will follow after.  I would recommend this book for anyone who likes creative worlds with deep characters.  The writing is excellent and the characters feel real.  One can put themselves into the position of some of the characters and say \\"Yeh I would have done the same thing\\".  There were even parts where I could not read fast enough I was so excited to see what the next page had for me.  I am excited to see where this series goes in the next decade.
0399536108|5.0|The message of The Art of Non-Conformity is deceptively simple. \\"You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to. You can do good things for yourself and make the world a better place at the same time. Here's how to do it.\\"    Why is this not as simple as it sounds? Simply put, so many of us first have to shout down all the voices that have told us we need to get a job, put in our time, blend in, etc., that it's nearly impossible to listen to the cravings for something more within us.     If you are looking for a resource that will give you the courage to listen to your intuition, exercises to help you decide what you really want out of life, tactics for dealing with the inevitable negativity you'll encounter when you make unconventional life choices, and pragmatic advice on how to pursue your passions...this is it. A dense book without a lazy sentence, you won't be able to wait to start working towards your own unconventional goals.
0399536108|5.0|I should start with a disclosure. I have a PhD in Sociology and I teach at a community college. These two facts color my reading of Chris Guillebeau's The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World in a way that other readers might not share. (They also have to do with why I was selected as one the people to receive this book free of charge from the author.)<br /><br />I spend my days reading about and studying the gatekeepers and vampires that Guillebeau discusses and I am aware of even more devious and negative forces than he identifies. As a sociologist, however, one of the things that pleases me most about the book is the acknowledgment that other people exist. Far too many books in this genre forget the context in which one has to live an unconventional life. Guillebeau does not. He not only understands the need for dealing with those who would pressure a person to conform, but the need for a social structure to succeed (a \\"Small Army\\" he calls it) and the understanding of how one's actions affect the lives of others (\\"world domination\\"). We do not live our lives in a vacuum and Guillebeau's approach meets this context head on.<br /><br />The thing that saddens me most about the book is that Guillebeau is not really that unconventional. Much of his advice and approach can be found in basic common sense and old fashioned understandings of how human beings should value their life, their time and other people. Most of what I read in this book I've heard before in other places. (Of course, I've lead a fairly unconventional life up to now and I share an influence in Barbara Sher, most notably her classic book, Wishcraft).<br /><br />This saddens me because in our society this has become radical. It is radical now for a young person to ask themselves questions about their values, their talents, their desires, their legacy. It is radical to live apart from a centralized social and economic structure that is designed to encourage conformity and consumption. It is radical to question and create. It is radical to explore and discover.<br /><br />Guillebeau is correct. It is radical and it will be met with resistance.<br /><br />At community college I meet adult students of all ages who often are in school as an effort to change their lives. Unlike university settings, many of these students have already experienced some of their life and have already experienced disappointments. They have children. They have jobs. They struggle.<br /><br />And as a sociology professor I have more bad news. I have to tell them that it is not the truth that education and a degree are magic entry into the middle class. I have to tell them that they are competing with other workers who have head starts on them because of social class structures and that the data connecting \\"a good education\\" with \\"a good paying job\\" is spurious because young people from middle and upper-middle class families with economic and social connections already in place get educations and degrees too, and then rely upon their parent's business connections to find the good paying job. In other words, the conventional life that Guillebeau so eloquently describes is often an illusion, available only to the few and the game is rigged in favor of that few.<br /><br />But I remind them that there is good news in sociology as well. The good news is that the world in which we live is of our own making collectively. Most of what we perceive to be set in stone is merely the sum total of decisions made by individuals who are accepting scripts about life that can be questioned. In the questioning there is power. There is power to resist, power to drop out, power to change, power to be something different. The answers do lie in the unconventional and the nonconformity.<br /><br />This book will not make you rich in the conventional sense. It is not a \\"10-easy steps\\" to life satisfaction. It is an honest account of a life well lived with some excellent pointers on how to get started living such a life. But in the end we must all live our lives as we choose within the context of everyone else living their lives as they choose.<br /><br />So I am grateful for this book as a teacher and as a fellow traveler. It is a primer that I think anyone who is considering the question \\"What do I do?\\" should read. It is a book that I will be recommending a lot, as I have Guillebeau's website since finding it last year. It is a book that has helped me in making some decisions about my own path. It is a book that is needed in this time and this place.<br /><br />--Pattie Thomas, Ph.D.llent pointers on how to get started living such a life.

B0036EH3XE|3.0|Spoilers below.    The idea of destroying the Island by bombs to prevent subsequent things from happening can never work.  The purpose of the Island from the outset is to ensure tight custody of hell from breaking loose whereas the purpose of the guardian and candidates is to protect it.  They are never meant to escape from the Island and definitely not to wipe it out from the surface of the earth by bombs.  We can tell the Island is still intact and there is no signs of holocaust when they woke up on the Island in 2007 right after the bombing.    Things got complicated when Jacob laid down the rule :  all his candidates will not be told of the reasons behind their painful experiences.  They have to figure it out by themselves along the way.    Charles Widmore and his wife have been obsessed by the mysterious power of the Island eversince their youth.  They certainly don't want the Island to be destroyed by Mr Blacksmoke.  Jacob most probably made a deal with them along with a plan to destroy Mr Blacksmoke by Jack, Desmond and their fellowship.  Somehow, Jacob is the only person fully aware of the mechanism of the heart of the Island, among other things, Jack and Desmond's abilities to resist strong electromagnetic current without injuries.    Jacob's twin brother was forbidden to leave the Island by his stepmother because the secret of the Island had been revealed to him and it could not be spread into the outside world.  But in the end, Mr Blacksmoke must never leave the Island because now he is evil.      Even when the Island began to fall apart, its mysterious power turn Mr Blacksmoke into a mortal being.    I am not surprised that Jack most likely survives in the end.    After having the sacred drink, now Jack is like Jacob.  We can see he survived the strong electromagnetic current.  He even managed to get out from the cave all by himself and walked a long way to the bamboo field to lay down to rest.  When Vincent the dog appeared, I bet Rose and Bernard won'tbe far away just in time to save Jack.    Since there is no more Mr Blacksmoke and the threat to the Island is now gone,  I strongly believe Kate and James will regroup and return to the Island with Penny.  Afterall, the code of fellowship is \\"No one is left behind\\".    Newborns on the Island are special.  But are they a blessing or a threat to the Island ?  Ben's daughter Alex had been killed and Sun's daughter was not born on the Island, leaving Aaron to be the only child born on the Island. Will Aaron become another Jacob or another Blacksmoke ?    Apparently the unanswered mysteries of the Island will not be fully explained.  We have to find out all the answers ourselves, perhaps from a new series of Lost.    Anyway, Lost definitely deserves a better ending and a new series of adventures surrounding the original Island world irrespective of what happened in the make-believe world which is too good to be true.    Jacob has all the luck.  His twin brother can never leave the Island to see the rest of the world while Jacob can travel anywhere around the world to carry out his recruitment plan.    Jacob makes all the rules and chooses his candidates according to his rules.  Their lives are flawed.  Indeed, everybody's life is flawed, one way or another.  Who isn't?    Whatever it takes, the plane must crash.  The plane crash was definitely no accident.  It appears that Jacob planned it on purpose.  No doubt, there were always casualties.  Were those people died in the plane crash just victims of circumstance or were they just dispensable?  Did they or their families really deserve all this?  What if Jack asks Jacob the same questions?  Will Jacob tell Jack that those people won't die for nothing?

The price completely blows other HDMIs out of the water and the quality of the product is just as good. Couple that with free two-day shipping from Amazon Prime Student and I was so happy with this great discovery. Anyone who needs an HDMI cable should just get this. And with frustration-free packaging, it was easy to open up and use right out of the box.<br /><br />For those of you who are looking at HDMIs for the first time, they serve the purpose of traditional HD wires, but with the added convenience that all the wires that were previously required to transmit a high-def audio/video signal have been combined into a single wire.

B002VWNICW|5.0|Keira Knightley is a revelation here.  Watch her closely as she responds to Mr. Darcy's question about encouraging affection... amazing!  Her youth and vivacity give us as passionate an Elizabeth as Jennifer Ehle's grace and intelligence did in 1995.  Meanwhile, Matthew MacFadyen is just so much more manly and plays a more layered Darcy than Colin Firth - proud, brooding, conflicted, honorable, but also awkwardly unglued in front of Elizabeth.  And he does it ever so subtly - just a twitch of his lips, a blink of his eyes.  With his rugged good looks, strong built, and that voice... there is no need for a wet shirt scene to make women and less manly men swoon!  (By the way, I shall never understand why some complain about the extra ending scene, when MacFadyen's bare calves are far more attractive than Firth's wet shirt.  I was too young in 1995, but did anyone complain about the lake scene then?  I rest my case.)      I love the 1995 version, but only because of Ehle's performance.  As much as I think Firth is one of the best actors out there, his Darcy never did stir anything for me.  He seemed too cold, too detached, and (sorry) \\"not handsome enough to tempt me\\".  I just never pictured Darcy to look like him when I read the book. I didn't see any chemistry between the two  until much later in the story, when Elizabeth visits Pemberley.  Whereas, Knightley and MacFadyen's is electrifyingly oh-so-palpable from the first moment they lay eyes on each other!       Throw in the wonderful supporting cast, beautiful locations, divine editing, and that battle scene in the rain... I'm in heaven!  Five starred, albeit one gripe:  As every P&P fan shall agree, this blu-ray does NOT meet expectations in the EXTRA FEATURES department.  We don't get the original goodies from the original DVD release: no P&P Diaries (although the Politics of Dating is interesting).  But worst, worst, worst of all is that the highly anticipated deleted scenes are not included!!!!!  Mr. Wright, weshan't mind watching extra shots of bonnets and carriages!  I'm hoping -- nay, praying -- that they will issue a special edition at some point.  Why, I promise to pay whatever their price... if only they add the deleted scenes that we know exist!    Lacking extra features it may be, the movie is still worth the blu-ray viewing.  The picture quality is very very good.  Gone is the fuzzy focus of the DVD - you could actually see lint off Knightley's shoulder and the pup at Caroline Bingley's feet (missed that one on the DVD).  If you have the DVD, donate it to some worthy cause, and pick up the blu-ray.  Pop some corn and enjoy!
0545123283|5.0|I laughed, I balled, and I felt every emotion possible as I read Linger. I was so captivated by it that I literally could not put the book down until I was done reading it. Once I was finished, I wanted to read it again. Linger is literally one of my favorite reads and one I will read again and again. I adore Maggie's writing and the in depth world and characters she has created. She's left me feeling torn between who I like more, Sam or Cole.<br /><br />Linger is one of those rare books where the author allows you to not only become part of the main character's lives, but one where you get to become a part of the supporting characters lives as well. I really enjoyed Linger being from 4 different points of view, as that broadened the story a lot more me. I was able see all different sides of the story, and what each person and wolf is dealing with and how they change and grow by the end of the book. I liked seeing each of the characters through someone else's eyes and getting to know the character's own personal stories.<br /><br />Not only are Grace and Sam's point of views ones that will leave you sighing at times and other times grabbing for a box of tissues, but Cole and Isabelle's point of views are both humorous and heart breaking. Isabelle had me laughing out loud when Cole provided me with understanding why those who turn may like being wolves, when Sam didn't. Cole brought more realism to the story. I wonder how many people wouldn't love a new chance at a different life, when the one life you were living, wasn't worth living any more. I liked seeing the different point of views on being a wolf with both Sam and Cole, as they both viewed it so differently. That's what made it more real for me.<br /><br />Cole's character seemed to be such a pivotal one. I liked that he was the one who was there for Sam, when Sam couldn't stand him. Sam and Grace's relationship is amazing. I love their sweet moments together. I felt their joys and sorrows and if I say anything else, than I'll be spoiling the book, which is a little tempting as there's so many things to talk about. I will say that Sam and Grace both showed an inner strength at various times in the story that will pull at your heart. The ending may leave you yelling, crying and turning the pages hoping to find out what happens next, only to realize we have to wait for Forever's release.<br /><br />Linger kept it's believability, which I really enjoyed. I think sometimes authors lose the chemistry and the draw they had for me in their first books, when they write their second books and then find it again in their third books. For me, Linger didn't lose that at all. It took what Shiver had and took it to the next level. Linger is a gripping, emotional roller coaster ride I didn't want to be done with when it came to an end. Now I'm left wondering what will happen to Grace, Cole and Sam in the next book.

0439023513|5.0|Catching Fire left me in shock, and Mockingjay just wowed me. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Mockingjay takes us right into war, and it's not pretty, but when is war ever pretty!?! Suzanne Collins does a brilliant job at bringing to life a darker world with the ugliness of war, the politics, the lies, the suffering and yes, even the small glimmer of hope that comes from a movement backed by a few people, called rebels.<br /><br />Mockingjay isn't a light-hearted read. It's the darkest of the trilogy that has my mind still reeling from the events, the revelations and what's really been happening during the span of the entire series and it's \\"games\\". Put your seat belt on and be prepared for surprises, revelations, anguish, triumph, raw emotion, heartbreak, \\"YES!\\" moments, bittersweet moments, and an end that left me feeling that Katniss's story was complete.<br /><br />Mockingjay wraps up the Hunger Games trilogy with love and loss, triumph and destruction, and every emotion in between there. Where many characters would curl up in the fetal possession and give up, Katniss's inner strength carries her on in the face of so much turmoil. Mockingjay will be talked about and discussed for a long time. It's thought provoking and emotional. While Mockingjay gave me answers, I was also left thinking about what I read days after I finished the book.<br /><br />If you enjoyed The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, wait until you read Mockingjay! If you haven't already, be sure to go pick up your copy today!!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Making a sequel is a tricky business, especially when it is a hugely successful series. When it is a second sequel, stakes get higher. Look what happened after the great one-two punch of \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Godfather II,\\" or \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\"?

As many people say, \\"Pixar can do no wrong.\\" I am not actually sure about that (as the last year's \\"Up\\" was something of a disappointment), but as far as the \\"Toy Story\\" franchise is concerned, it is true. People at Pixar will not be likely to fail in living up with our expectations.    Andy has grown up. As he is leaving home for college, and his sister is moving into his room, there is no reason for his toys to remain there. After some misunderstandings and confusions, Woody, Buzz, Jessie and other lovable toys find themselves in Sunnyside Daycare center, where Lotso, the bear with a strawberry scent politely welcome them. Maybe too politely.    \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a rip-roaring \\"Great Escape\\"-type adventure film with lots of funny moments, providing many rousing action sequences interspersed with comic relief, but there is also a darker aspect to the deceptively simple story, which will make you think, for instance: What happened to Wheezy the Penguin and Andy's other toys? What happened to yours? Where are they now? We are touched by the characters and their struggle to survive because we know exactly that in reality most of them cannot escape the inevitable (an attic or a garbage truck, as the film suggests).     That's why the ending is very important. Some viewers may be surprised at the finale which I am sure will make you cry, but this is also a clever way to conclude the story that started 15 years ago. See it for yourself.
0307454541|5.0|This was a great book.  The first few pages seemed to drag a bit to me, but then it really took off.  I couldn't put it down.  And then to my delight, my book clube selected it for this month's book.  Now I'm already ahead of the game!  I've read the second in the series and am anxiously awaiting the third to arrive in the mail!
0142501123|5.0|We live in South Florida, where we are deprived of the later seasons of the year, such as Fall and Winter. I personally love Fall, but we do not enjoy it here.  To get my daughter into the spirit, I researched Halloween/Fall theme books to read her and \\"Room on the Broom\\" came up on that list.  I ordered it from the local library because I spend way too much money on books for her and unless I know she loves it, I'm not going to buy her a million books. I think we will be buying Room on the Broom very soon.  I personally love the book and thinks it's a great story about friendship.  My daughter is only 2 years old so I didn't want a Halloween/spooky book that would scare her. The dragon bit did unnerve her at first, but I assured that witches and dragons are real and that the witch's friends saved her from the dragon.  That being said, my daughter really does not like monsters, dragons, or any spooky things too much, so perhaps a boy or a braver girl might not even require reassurance about the drago.  Even still, my daughter loves it and frequently requests each night in order to avoid bedtime.  Room on the Broom, she says.  She also wants to be a witch this Halloween.  I love the repetitive rhyming and how cooperative the animals and the witch are.  It's a nice twist on the spooky witch theme.  Unfortunately, the library copy has a page missing whre the frog apparently comes no board, but I love the ending where they are all a place on the broom including a pool for the frog.  It's a great book and I'm so happy I found it with the help of Amazon's reviews.  As a parent, I like reading this book...I like the story (it's interesting and new), I like the pictures, and the theme of Halloween/Fall.
0553805371|5.0|God the Universe I was in the womb. The womb was in my mother. My mother was on the earth. The earth is in the solar system. The solar system is in the Milky Way. The Milky Way is in the universe. Well, now where is the universe? What happens to logic? Some say it fails, some say it ends, some say physics is complete. Stephen Hawkings perhaps persumes that universe created itself from nothing. Nothing? I am sure when Dr Hawkings said god he means the entity in which the god's men have faith based on belief. So says he that the universe is not created by the so called god. If God is not an entity then Hawkings can be right for assuming the universe or the creation itself as god and so he has faith based on physics that universe created itself. First please debate whether god is an entity or a non entity.     One comment on this controversy asks Dr Hawkings what was before the Big Bang. Well, it was the colllapsing universe into the largest singularity, having the total energy, both the energy that manifests and the energy that does not manifest fused together. This singularity further collapses to trigger the Big Bang. The birth of the universe gives out two energies one that manifests into matter and the other which does not manifest remains as energy and expands along with the matter to hold them. Since this expansion and collapse occurs once in 100 years(NOT TERRESTRIAL YEAR)he must have said the universe creates itself from nothing.      Religions live in the past. Scientists live in the future. God's men   think god made man in his own immage for ever. Science tells us about evolution and man is not the final form of evolution. He can take mutation and get higher level of intelligence and find the answers and the Truth one day. It's unfair to expect science to unfold all the secrets in our lifetime. After all we humans even after thousands of years are not sure about god.     More than Dr Hawkings' declaration, I am amused by the reactions from godmen. Why not ask a couple of questions.Where was god the entity before his creation? Did he create the universe around him or outside. Why did he choose that particular time to create? What was he doing before the creation? Why is god addresed as He and not She. When god said let there be light and there was light...how did sound come into being?God created the universe in an order (the order of evolution). Why cant he create in the reverse?     A comment said seeing is not believing. Is hearing believing? For ages now we believe that Mosses came down from the hill top and said that he spoke with god. Fortunately for some and unfortunately for others Erich von Daniken was not there, if he was he would'nt have believed it.  MargoKSam India
B003U0I9U0|5.0|A-ha has been tops on my favorites list of bands since 1985 when \\"Take on me\\" topped the charts here in the U.S. I was even fortunate enough to see them live in Toronto in 1986 right after \\"Scoundrel Days\\" was released. I've followed them through good albums and not so good albums but overall they have always delivered the magic that made them stand the test of time. I was very sorry to hear of them breaking up this year and going their separate ways. It has been an amazing run to say the least. It is really a shame that the U.S. couldn't appreciate them for more than that one first hit. Most people I talk to about A-ha only remember \\"Take on me\\" and the video for it. Talk about an underrated band! They matured and changed so much over the past 2 1/2 decades. Glad I didn't just buy the single for \\"Take on me\\" and forget about the rest of the album! \\"Hunting High and Low\\" was my very first CD some 500 ago!<br /><br />This final \\"hits\\" collection is really a must have for A-ha fans or anyone looking to experience their releases in one collection. I loved the story of how they came to be and the trip through time, from then to now, that was included in the liner notes. It was nice to see a couple of different versions of the songs included on here as I have virtually all of them on CD somewhere or other already. Even though I have all of their previous albums I still wanted to get a copy of this one for myself just to have as a final farewell.<br /><br />Thanks for 25 great years of music!
B000006TRV|5.0|There is much that has been said concerning this album and I realize that this review is one of thousands.  However, I believe this album to be the greatest work of rock that I have ever experienced.  Experienced is the word for \\"The Wall,\\" not \\"heard\\", because it wasn't made to be a collection of songs with a smattering of hits to make some money.    Roger Waters wrote the wall with the intention of taking the audience through a journey.  As I stated in the title, it is a rather disturbing journey due to the disturbed state of Waters at the time.  Although he was not dealing with radical mental problems like the former band member Syd Barrett had, he was displeased with the band's station in the world of rock.  This, coupled with common difficulties afflicting most rock bands, created very abstract emotions.    The story behind \\"The Wall\\" is one of insecurity.  Centered on the fictional \\"Pink,\\" the album tells the story of his life.  Each song focuses on some period of his life, coupled with the recurring theme of \\"tearing down the wall.\\"  There have been many critics that argue whether Pink does or does not represent Roger Waters.  If not, many of the feelings portrayed during the album do reflect Waters' own feelings shown by the fact that the album is so incredibly personal.    The reason then, that I would highly recommend \\"The Wall,\\" is that the whole album has the effect of great literature.  An excellent book is written with the intent of transporting you to the artist's world and letting you see through his eyes.  As C.S. Lewis said, it is to, \\"feel my being enlarged.\\"  \\"The Wall\\" is a rare work of music because it lets you see the world through the eyes of the artist.  Now whether you feel your being enlarged from it, that's for you to decide.
0439023491|5.0|I was not prepared for this second book of the series to be so GOOD.<br />I mean it, its GOOD.<br />I thought there would be a lag in the story, filler to get you ready for book three.  This is just \\"not\\" the case.<br />This is probably the best \\"middle of the trilogy\\" book I have ever read.<br /><br />The ending is superb and it sets the stage perfectly for book three.<br /><br />The author never ever lets me follow a train of thought on how the book will go.  She alludes to things and I am ready for a whole different chain of events than what really comes about.<br /><br />This review doesn't even matter really.  Go read [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] and you will end up reading this anyways and you will find that this is just as good or better than the first book and be ready for book three like I am.
B002ZG99CM|2.0|You want The Karate Kid? Get the original. You want a 2010 pop culture attempt on the original? Try to make it through this one without rolling your eyes constantly - I dare you.    The problem with this movie is that it didn't need to exist. Every character, every aspect, every shot, every line of dialogue in this film is inferior to the original. It truly feels like this exists only to make money and get Will Smith's son in a movie. Jaden isn't bad, at least not compared to the other actors who are absolutely dreadful - the children, at least. The bullies are as cardboard as it gets, and Jaden's love interest is also bland. They all speak English, but it's so bad that they're hard to understand, and acting in a foreign language isn't like acting in your native language - and these kids are terrible when attempting to act in English.     Bad acting aside, there are plenty of over things to despise as well. The movie is virtually a shot for shot remake of the original, except they added a Chinese twist to everything. Make no mistake, though, if it existed in the original it exists in the remake - just in a really bad way. The karate is also absolutely ridiculous. It's comical the things these kids can do. 12 year olds doing kicks that send each other flying 20 feet, and how many 12 year olds get their butt kicked and don't cry? Yeah, right. Also, the idea that a bunch of 12 year olds would attack a full grown man who obviously knows more Kung-Fu than them is laughable. It made sense in the original. They were all in high school. But Chinese children attacking a man? Please...it's incredibly unbelievable.    The movie is lousy, and I wanted to like it. I hoped it would be a unique take on the story - it's not. It's the exact same thing, it's just a million times worse.
B00012L786|4.0|Night-for-night shooting and low-key lighting infuse Sam Fuller's 1953 production with a stark, noir ambiance.  Adding to the paranoia of this tough romance is the authentic atmosphere of 1950's \\"red menace\\" fears that were rampant (some controversial scholars now say the fear was grounded in a reality).<br /><br />Richard Widmark is a master pick pocket.  On a crowded New York subway, he dips his fingers into Jean Peter's purse and unknowingly lifts some communist microfilm that he later tries to leverage for 25 Gs. Dirty commie rats and determined cops swirl around a desperate couple's entanglement.<br /><br /> Sam Fuller was a seasoned reporter with street smarts.  His no nonsense films are tightly written and artfully composed.  The compelling characters are usually in emotional turmoil with the threat of unexpected violence -- and death -- always lurking.  Widmark's wonderfully cynical face and voice and beautiful Peter's hard-boiled but vulnerable character are just right.  Thelma Ritter steals her scenes as doomed street snitch (she was nominated for an Oscar©).  A cool Criterion extra is Richard Schickel's video interview with colorful director Fuller.
0143118420|4.0|I had heard mixed reviews on this book and finally decided to read it for myself to see what I thought of the book, and having done that, I've reached a few conclusions.  Yes, the author can be incredibly self-absorbed. As can all memoir authors. That's why they call them memoirs.  Yes, the author was able to run away, to escape from her life, to try (successfully) to find herself. What woman hasn't wanted to do that, I ask you? Just because she has been able to do that doesn't make her evil or self absorbed. It makes her blessed.  Yes, I truly believe that unless you've suffered something catastrophic such as a bad accident, the death of a close loved one, or a divorce, you will find the author to be narcissistic. Having gone thru a disasterous marriage and subsequently divorce, coupled with the death of my brother and two rounds of unemployment, I am highly qualified to relate, and relate well, to this author's plight.    This book is an enjoyable read, and one of the few books I've ever strung out into days worth of reading just because I've wanted to savor the reading.
1416550534|2.0|I am a complete sucker for the type of story where an old lady looks back on her long life, musing on the past, on hidden secrets and tucked-away regrets. Combine that familiar but fascinating frame of a story with a late Edwardian/WWI setting and you've completely hooked me into your book - no questions asked.<br /><br />But that's exactly the problem with Riverton - the pages will fly beneath your fingertips and you'll find yourself consuming chapters at a rapid pace but ultimately you'll get to the end of the book and you'll have more questions than answers.<br /><br />Without completely giving away the plot, I felt that the big \\"surprises\\" were completely obvious almost from the get-go while some of the key relationships in the book - between Grace and Hannah and between Hannah and Emmeline especially were underdeveloped. Grace makes a decision about 75% of the way through the book that occurs far too quickly and yet it's meant to be a moment of ultimate sacrifice that sets up the tragedy of later events - instead, it feels rote and predictable.<br /><br />I suspect that a great deal of the book's problems have to do with pacing - you know the results of the key moment in the book almost from the beginning and hear it about so many more times throughout the 468 pages that by the time it actually takes place in the narrative, it's almost a letdown. The reader has been repeatedly told that the events of that night were \\"horrifying\\" and changed several lives permanently. I read it and had only one reaction - \\"Finally!\\"<br /><br />Riverton does succeed at pulling you into a seductive narrative, walking you through a great English manor house at leisure; allowing you to roll in summer-heated gardens and ward off a chill by an enormous fireplace. You'll see parties from both sides of the social spectrum - from the upper-class dining room to the servant's kitchen downstairs. The sense of social customs, the servants and the family's ways of speaking to each other and the descriptions of ball gowns, parties and motorcars all feel spot-on. You can even subtly sense the changes in society from pre-WWI to the beginning of the Roaring Twenties.<br />Unfortunately, it feels as if Morton devoted more time to creating a literary world she loves rather than creating a plot that it something more than a pastiche of familiar Gothic novels. If you want to read a book with an old lady as an unreliable narrator, a forbidden love affair, a tortured sister relationship and a fading rich family's fortunes, try Margaret Atwood's vastly superior The Blind Assassin - a book that brilliantly stitches together several different literary traditions into something new. Or, give Kate Morton another try with the more interesting The Forgotten Gardenarties and motorcars all feel spot-on.

0439023513|1.0|Sorry. I just WANT to like Mockingjay so bad. I can't keep putting off my decision on whether to like it or not.<br /><br />Ok. The author MADE us hate Gale... because she wanted Katniss and Peeta to end up together. I didn't choose to hate him, and truly, I don't. It makes me dislike the author as much as I dislike Katniss without Gale.<br /><br />I understand Katniss and Peeta together; they went through the games so they can understand each other, he redeems her, all that sort of stuff. I LIKE Peeta. But being forced to hate Gale doesn't let me love him, or be glad that he ended up with the girl.<br /><br />At first, I didn't know what to think about Katniss. I am not a \\"dwell on it\\" kind of person, which we know from her situation with her mom after her dad's death, she is exactly that. I should have known, but to let her \\"soulmate\\" become hated because of something out of his control... that just seems a bit much.<br /><br />I read a review (amazon, maybe?) about her behavior, hiding in closets, escaping through blackouts, ect... and the reviewer, a trained psychologist, says that the author really did her homework when it came to post-traumatic stress syndrome. That Katniss basically was a poster child for what people go through. That explained a lot about her behavior and her constant blacking out, but didn't necessarily endear me to her character. I want a strong, always on their game heroine. Not one who can't get a grip. I want someone who comes out stronger, a better person, not simply a survivor. A sucky survivor at that.<br /><br />And, since post-traumatic stuff is mostly associated with war, it made me think that someone (the author? publisher? editor?) had an agenda and there is nothing more that I hate than a book that goes all agenda on me when all want is to be entertained. If I want to read about how war is terrible and we should stop all of the conflict, I'll pick up a newspaper.<br /><br />The being passed out for most of the action was a very plausible idea, but it just seemed like lazy writing to me.<br /><br />The book is obviously science fiction. The author should have left it at that and not tried to go so deep with Mockingjay. Develop the character, yes. Give us something to think about, yes please. Indoctrinate, force us to hate a character and rush the end.... unforgivable. Sorry.<br /><br />I tried. Just can't like it.riting to me.    The book is obviously science fiction.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|At the end of Catching Fire, I guess I expected the series to focus on the love triangle in the remaining book. Certainly, the love triangle gets resolved in this last installment, but it's not the main theme.  Instead, this book is about the war, and it gets pretty bleak at times. There's a lot of violence, and it's not just battle-type violence - there's a lot of psychological violence and torture. It's ugly, but I guess war is.<br /><br />All three of the main characters change in ways that aren't necessarily the way I wanted things to go. However, I know that no one can go through war without changing, and the changes the characters go through seem consistent with what would really happen to a person in war. I thought Katniss changed less than the others; she starts out raging, and she ends with the same anger-fueled impulsiveness she's shown throughout the series.<br /><br />Did I like the book? I'm not sure. I finished last night after racing through it (on my new Kindle - so cool!). And I suppose I have some sympathy for Katniss, but I just don't like her as much as I would like to.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Finally, I had the chance to read The Lost Symbol!<br /><br />What draws me to Dan Brown?  Besides being controversial to the point that I have to slip a book cover over his books in this predominantly Catholic community, I love the fact that his books make me question, think, then question some more.<br /><br />Anyways, the history aspects of any of Brown's novels are an added plus, as well as the  mystery that is always involved in his collection of novels.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol was another magnificent creation, all 500 pages filled with stunning adventure and suspense. Just as The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons had done in the past,  Robert Langdon is called in to solve the latest puzzle.  I can't help it, maybe it's Robert, with his extensive historical knowledge or that pensive grin that Tom Hanks delivers, that has won me over.  I spent hours reading this novel, unable to put it down, entranced by the story.<br /><br />As in all of Mr. Brown's novels, the villain is a true psychopath that believes he is doing the world a wealth of good.  Mal'akh has wealth, influence and women, but he forsakes his fortune for ultimate power.<br /><br />Masonic mysteries, CIA angles, symbolism,  each item was perfectly wound into this novel.  Just as the movie National Treasure inspired me to question the linkings of the Masons to the history of the United States, Brown's novel makes me want to tour the Capital with a whole new insight.<br /><br />Fantastic, thrilling and worth 4 stars
0060765380|4.0|The Judas Strain by James Rollins is another Sigma verses the Guild story as the agents for good and evil try and out fox each other with the world itself as a game board.  What's interesting is that though this can be said of any of Rollins' sigma stories, none of the stories are alike.  Each tale is original, with the reappearing characters always showing new and different sides of their personalities.  New places are explored and new characters added creating mixed feelings of the familiar and the unknown.  History and science meet up in unusual ways and modern day weapons keep everybody running for their lives.  This is a book that gives you new and interesting things to think about while you are escaping all the things you don't want to think about.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Honestly, Julie & Julia is one of those movies where  you better have something to eat stashed next to you.  I swear I salivated through the entire film, enjoying every scene that played through with elegant pictures of delicious meals that makes one want to shoot out and pick up the cookbooks that Julia Child wrote in her prolific career. (Yes, I will admit that I couldn't resist shooting over to Amazon.  Currently, I have one in the mail.)<br /><br />Julie & Julia is an entrancing and lovely story divided between the lives of two equally charming women, our modern-day Julie and the ever charming aficionado of the kitchen, Julia.  Meryl Streep is at her stunning best, pulling off the perfect performance of Julia Child.  Her portrayal was so precise, I had to find a photo and video on Google to compare the two women.<br /><br />A person doesn't have to be a fan of Julia Child to enjoy this movie.  Honestly, I wasn't, at first.  My thoughts changed entirely as I continued to watch this movie.  Julie & Julia was an entrancing walk into the life of a woman that we all had seen at one time or another on television, but knew little of her life or the passion that she had with her husband or her chosen career.  Julie (Amy Adams), who becomes so involved in her 365 day blog of cooking each meal in Julia's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, gradually finds joy in the momentous task she has taken on. As a viewer, I found that Julie grew from a self-conscious wreck into a confident and self-assured young woman, all due to the wise guidance of our towering chef.<br /><br />To say I loved this movie would be an understatement, but I would recommend having a full meal before you sit down to watch it.
B000JML7EC|5.0|When I first read this book, I was 11 and I loved it. As a Social Studies teacher, I try to read some fiction on occasions.(so much history to read you know) I throughly enjoyed this free kindle edition.It reintroduced me to old friends such as Jim Hawkins , Ben Gunn and of course Long John Silver. The first chapters took me back to comfortable surroundings at the Admiral Bendbow Inn as the pirate Billy Bones first came into the world of young Jim Hawkin's. You will quickly swept up into the land of Black Spots, pirate songs and the blind pirate Old Pew who still scares me.There may be superior abridged versions for younger readers, but I felt this kindle edition is fine and it makes the classic story easy to access.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|This is the movie my friends and I have waited three long years to see. It's very bloody, gory, sexy, kinky and funny and that's what makes it a good movie to see with your buds. I noticed there were a few scenes from the faux trailer that weren't used in the movie, but it won't ruin the fun. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a former Mexican Federale turned renegade. Three years after a druglord named Torrez killed his family, Machete is in Texas trying to find work. Machete is soon hired by a businessman named Booth to kill the corrupt Senator McLaughlin. After Machete is set-up, double crossed, and left for dead, he puts together a team of illegal immigrants to kill the bad guys. If you wanna eff with the wrong Mexican, I highly recommend MACHETE!!!
7885142450|4.0|The Film: Instead of taking the \\"let's adapt the show to a two hour film\\" approach of the first flick, the second film strays wildly from the show, improving and expanding upon an already legendary series.  There are moments in it when your jaw will drop, the animation, direction, and writing is so good.  Clearly they had more budget for this film and it's fantastic.  Each angel battle really feels like the end of the world, with an intensity and drama the best ones from the series contained.  This film is amazing!<br /><br />The DVD: The picture is fine as is the sound; the subtitles aren't always perfect and are a bit small, but that's a minor complaint.  Until this is released in the US, it's surely worth the money.  (It gets 4 stars instead of five due to the subtitling.)
0553805371|2.0|Stephen Hawking's reputation as a scientist is primarily based on his work on black holes in the 1970s. It was an early attempt to unite General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, an extremely difficult undertaking that engendered a measure of success, making it an important achievement in scientific history. His second claim to scientific fame was the unprecedented triumph of his book A Brief History of Time which sold more than 9 million copies. His well known battle with Lou Gehrig's Disease has confined him to a wheelchair making his raspy, unearthly computer voice instantly recognizable. It has turned him into the most famous scientist in the world but the media suggestion that he inhabits the scientific pantheon with Galileo, Newton and Einstein may be an exaggeration of his achievements. In the opinion of many scientists, legendary physicists such as Maxwell, Planck, Bohr, Dirac and Feynman have made greater contributions and Hawking's reputation as the great seer may be part of the problem with this book.<br /><br />Hawking and co-writer Leonard Mlodinow have written a short, popularized gloss of modern physics that assumes the reader knows almost nothing of science. We are told as if it were the very first time we had heard it that 2 dimensions means one needs 2 numbers to find a location and an ellipse is a stretched-out circle. The tone of the book can only be described as simultaneously lofty and dumbed-down in order to insure maximum sales. Anyone with even a little scientific sophistication may feel annoyed by this. In any event, the book is not targeted towards those comfortable with mathematics since not only are the simplest sums banished from the book but the very word mathematics seems to have been avoided by design. Where additional knowledge might have materially improved the book some tepid humor has been substituted instead. There are many cartoons included as well, as if emphasizing the book's popularized nature.<br /><br />Hawking controversially asserts that God was unnecessary during the birth and evolution of the multitude of universes that his chosen M-Theory posits as the cosmic landscape. Although he makes a point of offering this latest offspring of String Theory as his current choice for a Grand Unified Theory of everything, Hawking scarcely provides any explanation of M-Theory other than to assert that it is a theoretical patchwork quilt and conceptually very difficult. Surely if one is writing a book there is an obligation to provide more information than that. It strikes me as odd that in order to banish the concept of a single Creator from the universe Hawking must first embrace a cosmic landscape of 10^500 (10 raised to the power of 500, a number so large that it might as well be infinity) universes in order to explain why our own fortunate universe is so meticulously fine-tuned for life. Prof. Hawking's reason for doing this, of course, is that an infinite number of universes would statistically guarantee at least one life-bearing one, theoretically eliminating the need to explain why ours is so well-adapted for biology. But wouldn't a Supreme Being by very definition bridge all possible universes regardless of their number, thus leaving us right where we started? So why add the unnecessary additional layer of complexity? Surely this cannot be in the spirit of one of science's first principles: Occam's Razor, which suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.<br /><br />This book suffers from a real weakness: it often makes vague suggestions without offering substantive science. We are left with hazy conjectures when hard scientific realism is mandatory. Science is based on proof with mathematics as its rigorous handmaiden. Hawking offers us a handful of illustrations and some short anecdotal evidence in its stead. I found that deeply unsatisfactory and inevitably caught myself wishing that Hawking's reputation as a great seer had not clouded his judgement while writing this book.

B003LXSY60|5.0|I really like listening to this album. It's as good as Attack and Release, if not better, and very listenable. I think that it has wide appeal- I could see my dad listening to it and them also playing at a music festival like Austin City Limits. I would say it's chill but it also rocks. I like it a lot. In terms of other groups, I would say the closest music would be The Heavy.   I have and will continue to recommend this album to my friends!
B003JV6UYM|4.0|I purchased this doll for my 3 year old daughter and ever since she got it she hasn't put it down for more than five minutes.    The doll looks GOOD.  She has yarn hair, but it is tightly braided so you don't have to worry about a child pulling out the hair right out of the box and such and her outfit looks very good.    Only downfalls of this toy?  Her hat does NOT stay on her head unless you are holding it there (I think I'm going to punch a couple of holes through it and put a string on it so it'll hang from the dolls neck.  That way it might not get lost right away) and her arms do not bend.      Overall though, my daughter loves the toy and I would recommend it to others.
0553805371|4.0|The one obvious shortcoming of all this discussion is the lack of rigor and lack of humility. Yes, yes, you read right. And no, no, I am not a religious kook. I merely mean that what's missing is the admission that all such speculations and ideas are done in LANGUAGE, and therefore may have very little to do with the parts of the universe not graspable in language. No, no divinities or totems. Just parts of the universe which may not be graspable by a five pound of meat a.k.a. Human Brain.     You see, Mathematics is a language, and so is English, both the product of a five pound meat computer. So the implicit assumption behind this (and other such) splendid book is that the universe and human symbol systems are homologous.     \\"Homologous\\" here means that the universe and its qualities, attributes, behavior, etc., can be mapped one-to-one to the system of ink squiggles and air noises produced by humans, a.k.a language, which is the scaffolding of science. No symbol system, no science. No homology assumption, no science either.    But the universe-language presumed homology is an assumption, of course, which unfortunately cannot be either verified or refuted, since the question is self-referential, according to Goedel. Even more annoying (or amusing, depending on your point of view) is that we can say that since we language is the only tool we have to \\"comprehend\\" the universe with (i.e.: make one-to-one homologous structures of it), we can only grasp the parts of it that are homologous with the structure of our five pound m.b.c.    In sum, for the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. So for a man with a hammer-shaped (language-shaped) brain, only the universe's nails (parts graspable by language) are visible and comprehensible.     But here I must conclude, and I'll do it thus: This is a splendid book by smart people with very well developed, well trained m.b.c's who speculate entertainingly and usefully about the nails-parts of the universe graspable by the readers' (and the writers') hammer-shaped brains.    Goedel would be tickled.    AM
0374158460|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book, thinking from the reviews that it was going to be even better than the Corrections. That this book falls so short of the hype actually depressed me. Not a single reviewer speaks for me? That reviewers universally loved this book tells us that reviewers predominantly share the same sensibility. But readers are going to represent a diversity of sensibilities, and great art should transcend those differences. If it doesn't, it shouldn't be named The Book of The Century (unnecessary capitalization in salute to Freedom).     Many readers are going to find the book banal and tedious and whiny. They are going to find beautiful writing scarce (especially in comparison to the Corrections). They are going to find original insight lacking, even if they're entertainingly confessional. They are going to find characters that are close to allegorical, but combined with a theme that is too weak and too on the nose. They are going to find that most of the characters are overwrought, except for the few virtuous ones that are simply cartoonish. They are going to find a major character primarily represented in monologue -- as autobiography, as letter -- even in \\"dialogue\\" (quote unquote in salute to Freedom) Patty delivers monologues. If you don't like this in Shaw, you won't like it here.    It's also odd that none of the reviewers (that I know of) have compared this book to \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and \\"A Man in Full.\\" Franzen clearly owes a great debt to Tom Wolfe, more so in this book than in the Corrections. Could it be because Wolfe is not fashionably respected by the literati so it would get in the way of hyping this book to make the comparison? Tom Wolfe bad, Franzen good? I would rank both \\"Bonfire\\" and the first half of \\"A Man in Full\\" ahead of \\"Freedom\\" -- I think many readers will.    We aren't even given any sustained, beautiful metaphor work in this book. The main metaphor of the book? The Door of the Self! This is what is goingto save literature?     *Dorothy... had had to pass through death's bitter door unaccompanied...  *But the door to Joey was closed and locked now...  *Walter had slipped into his life before he'd shut the door on the world of ordinary people...  *Once the door had opened even just a millimeter... he knew what to do  *For his soul, a door opened wide enough for him to glimpse his pride...but he slammed the door shut  *As if there were still no end of inner doors for them to open...  *A draft was coming through a mental door that he'd assumed was shut and locked but in fact was standing wide open; a door that he could feel through  *Joey still presents a steel door to Patty, a door cooler and harder than ever, a door that she knows will remain closed...  *His inner door is locked against her, and she can't imagine how it will ever open again  *Joey in turn might open the door for her a little bit    Finishing with Richard's song: *There's an unmarked door to nowhere on the dark side of the bar...
0385342039|5.0|I just love this book. It made me laugh (a lot), cry, and everything in between. It is different (fresh) than many of the other books that I have read. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. It touches on family, love, and friendship.  I really recommend it if you are looking for something different and funny. Enjoy it!

0399536108|5.0|That's what can happen to a fortress of fear when reading this book.  As Seth Godin is saying: \\"...a truly scary book.\\"  At first, it may seem that the title is referring to not conforming to external factors.  After reading this book, I think you, like me, will find yourself running out of excuses and reasons for the delay of your success.      This book is really a must for the modern-day success-seeker's bookshelf.  One of the unique ways that this book has had an immediate impact on my life is upon reading it, I promptly removed several books from my shelf and donated them to the library, showing them to be obviously outdated.  That's pretty cool, right?!  It comes in and kind of takes over!  It is stimulating interesting action and confidence.    I think you will find that The Art of Non-Conformity will help you sort out any clutter internally and externally, and give you some great tools, internally and externally, to breathe more life into your waking success.       Within the confines of this book, the sky is the limit.     Check it out- for your success!
0307454541|3.0|This is not even in the league with other first rate Scandinavian mysteries I have read. I'm thinking of the Henning Mankell's Wallender series and, even more, of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo's Martin Beck novels. If you want a more contemporary Scandinavian scene; Asa Larsson's Rebecka Martinsson and Norwegian Joe Nesbo's Harry Hole are creatively and professionally crafted characters.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's first book is little more than a collage of adolescent clich&eacute;s, post-modern pseudo-intellectual rubbish, written into a kind of film script that masquerades as a novel. Maybe he is on to something here. Lisbeth Salander is a character with a truly unique mix of intellectual and emotional assets and liabilities. But instead of balancing her persona with the social landscape he is painting, he simply uses her personal traits to advance the plot to his advantage.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is a good deal less appealing. It's almost as if he enjoys a kind of vocal truth serum such that he only has to ask a question to get an answer that enables Larsson to move the plot along. How is it that no one ever replies \\"no comment\\"? Or is it that Swedes are just such open and honest folks that you just ask and they tell?<br /><br />So it all amounts to a Swedish setting for an American-style comic strip. The bad guys are incredibly bad. Apparently, they are somehow infected with the fascist gene they led Hitler to power, but how and why is never explored. Nazi madness is simply painted in, it would seem, to give the work a touch of gravitas.<br /><br />The (few) bad women are victims of bad men. That's about it. To really buy into the book you need to believe that the administration of justice in a nation whose economic and social systems are the envy of the western world is roughly on a par with that of Moscow, Mexico City, or Chicago.<br /><br />Still, Larsson has the good grace to serve up an ending we can all live with. So read and enjoy.
0307269752|2.0|I really thought I would like this book, since everyone I talked to loved it and couldn't wait to run out and buy the next ones to read.  Not me, I found very little interesting in the book and don't understand what all the fuss is about.  We read the book for our next book club meeting; it should an interesting book to discuss since people either like it or found it lacking.
0439023513|1.0|Horrible disappointment. I LOVED the first two books. Read them both twice. Recommended the series to everyone I spoke with. I was afraid to start Mockingjay b/c I was afraid I wouldn't want it end. I wish I had never read it. It was dark and depressing and nothing else. Terrible conclusion to what started out as a great series.

B004132HZS|5.0|I'll admit, I was skeptical at first.  After all, half of the allure of Sherlock Holmes is the grittiness and fog contrasting against the elegance and splendor of the Victorian era.  How would this translate in a modern era?  Surprisingly well, it turns out.  Although only 3 episodes have been released (and yes, it has been renewed for further seasons/series), Sherlock has already found a place in my heart (and a permanent slot on my iPod).  The acting is absolutely fabulous, and it is a smart blend of action, suspense, drama, and comedy, filled with references to the novels.      A Study in Pink (Steven Moffat): Written by the mastermind behind the latest season/series of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith (my favorite year of DW to date), and other gems like Jekyll (another modern retelling, this time of Robert Louis Stevenson's Victorian horror story), A Study in Pink re-introduces you to the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.  Based more off the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories than the movies that made the term \\"dearstalker\\" a household name, Holmes solves mysteries the police cannot using his powers of observation, keen ability to connect the dots, and a smartphone.  Watson, an Afghan war vet once more (things never really do change, do they?), is introduced to Holmes while looking for a roommate, and finds in him a friend and partner who can satisfy his need for adventure and danger in the humdrum of post-war life.  On the advice of his psychiatrist, Watson begins a blog about Holmes' cases, and thus fulfills the role of biographer to the famous consulting detective.  In this story, the police are looking into a series of deaths that are believed to be suicides by ingestion of pills, but Sherlock knows are murders.  The mystery takes second-stage to the characters in this one, though.  While the story suffers a smidgen for it, you will still have a ton of fun watching the characters develop and the stage get set.  A pitch-perfect introduction to what is surely going to be a beloved show for a long time.    The Blink Banker (Stephen Thompson): A series of mysterious spray-painted symbols links murders and disappearances to ancient Chinese artifacts.  Easily the weakest of the three stories so far, but still a good time, with some particularly fine acting by Martin Freeman.  The ending is especially chilling, and worth the price of admission alone.    The Great Game (Mark Gatiss): An explosion rocks London, and soon the culprit challenges Sherlock in a race against time to solve seemingly unrelated cases before the next bomb goes off.  Dr. Watson shines in this episode, showing that he is not the bumbling idiot as often portrayed in the movies (but NOT in the books, mind you; while he is not Sherlock's equal in terms of training, he is nearly as smart, and certainly more world-wise).  There are also some lovely moments between Sherlock and Mycroft, great character exposition with regards to how Sherlock's mind works, and the nemesis that has been winding himself into the plots and lurking in the background.   And the ending... oh, my.  My friends and I are still talking about it!    This program is more like three stand-alone movies, each episode being about 1.5 hours with a satisfying conclusion to wrap it up at the end (with one minor episode 3 caveat, about which I will not go further to avoid the slightest chance of spoiling the moment).  But like any movie and its sequels, it is still best to watch them in order.  (A side note: The price might seem like a bit much for only three episodes, until you realize how much you would be paying for one stand-alone movie.  And this show is better than most movies I could name.)
B002ZG98J6|4.0|Movie - 3.5    I've never read the books, I haven't read or seen any Harry Potter, and I still haven't seen Lord of the Rings at this point, so I'm not \\"over-sensitized\\" by the fantasy genre like some people may be. But I did recently see The Last Airbender, which is a total desecration to its source material. And I have to say, with that heap of garbage in mind, The Lightning Thief blows it out of the water in comparison. Lightning Thief is a PG movie, which doesn't bother me at all, as I personally think the rating has come to allow a lot more these days in terms of content. Any fan of the original or remake of Clash of the Titans should be able to pick up on a lot of the similarities in terms of screenplay and parts of the plot. And, it just so happens I've coincidentally had quite a bit of exposure to both versions of Clash, as well as Jason and the Argonauts within the last few days of this review, making this transition relatively smooth. When I first saw the trailer, the concept struck me as a modernized version of old Greek tales, though much more geared towards the young teen demographic. After eventually having my fair share of the Harryhausen classics and Leterrier's action-ized revision, I have to say Lightning Thief actually makes for a good dose of family entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, has a fairly light atmosphere between all the protagonists, and manages to tell a decently-paced adventure story. The script runs a bit on the generic side and the child actors don't get much room to show any real potential, but I like the casting of the adults. Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan, Steve Coogan, and Kevin McKidd add a good deal of maturity, and even a little poetic savvy with what little screen time they actually get. The film probably won't garner too much praise for originality, but if the mood ever strikes you for an effects-laden fantasy film, Lightning Thief wouldn't make for a bad choice.    Video - 4.5    Lightning Thief presents itselfon BD with excellent quality. The cinematography has a peculiar \\"darkness\\" to it that makes for some very bold colors. Greens and blues stick out the most and look very lush early on in the film with a chromatic progression towards more reds, grays, and blacks around the end. Black levels are deep and don't suffer any instances of crush, despite the photography, and contrast is very good at accentuating the actors' faces, as well as the fine prop and set designs. The special effects look especially pleasing with some pretty seamless integration of CG and visual staging. Two parts that I really like are the trip into Hades for its eerie and fearsome depiction, which I think was rather scary for a PG film, and the scene where Percy starts to realize the greatness of his power by summoning up a couple of pretty big tidal waves. And while the image is relatively sharp, the dark photography does manage to lose a little bit of detail in some of the low-lit scenes. Otherwise, the picture is nearly flawless.    Audio - 5.0    While the video may be just a tad off, the audio quality for Lightning Thief is flawless. Dialogue is crisp through the center, while high and low ends give off great fidelity. Being a fairly robust action film with a good deal of sound effects, directionality and separation are spot on. Mythical creatures, clashing weapons, and magical energies pop all across the sound stage with proper panning from left to right, right left, front to back, etc. when the action calls for it. Little things like shuffling feet on terrain, snake hair, flames, and water ripples help in showcasing the subtleties of the track. The score by Christophe Beck immerses with a very balanced plethora of orchestral pieces and adds that extra sense of depth to the adventure and action. But the real beast of the audio is bass. LFEs range from low and constant to absolutely booming. A good indicator of what to expect for a majority of the film should be from the get-go where we see Zeus introduced as his thunder rumbles in the night New York skies. From there on out, it's reference audio.    Extras - 2.0    Not a whole lot, here. No commentary track, 14 minutes of deleted scenes, a couple of interactive games that are nothing more than window dressing, and only about 20 minutes of making-of or behind-the-scenes featurettes. We get very brief interviews with various important persons like the director, the creator of the novels, the composer, and the three main child actors, but that's it.    Overall - 4.0    Lightning Thief is innocent and harmless fun that's definitely geared for PG audiences and family atmospheres alike. It's not the most original of fantasy tales, but what do you expect from a guy that was just trying to make up a bedtime story for his kid? I'm sure there's a lot of depth missing from the books that would certainly add to the plot, characters, and everything else, but I personally find this to be a better film than another piece of crap that came out the same year. With excellent video, reference audio, though a meager set of extras, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief comes recommended.
B003HLM2QO|1.0|As a longtime Ozzy fan I am disappointed. It is a better release than Black Rain, but that's not saying anything.  If this was from a new band, it would not go anywhere.  The music lacks emotion and dynamics.  Gus sounds to be a good guitarist, but for whatever reason, there seems to be nothing memorable or inspiring.  The more notes, the better, right?   The CD is nearly distorted on my system.  Apparently, this is a good candidate for worst over-compressed, maxed-out, mixing and production - which becomes fatiguing to listen to ( unfortunately, seems to the norm in the music industry these days.  See Wikipedia: Loudness War).
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Movie - 4.5    Gangster movies were not something I watched a lot of, at least as a kid. All the grit, violence, drama, complexities, etc. were way over my head. But in growing up, I came to acquire a taste for these things and eventually learned to like them a lot. I still haven't seen any of the Godfather movies, but I've recently been catching up on Scorsese. And in being one of the few that's actually seen and can appreciate Infernal Affairs (the original inspiration for The Departed), I have to say I was pretty excited after initially hearing Scorsese was attached to direct this Western adaption. When I first saw The Departed on DVD some years ago, I'd never seen a whole Scorsese film in any kind of entirety, but I knew his films by name and heard he was a great director. After finally watching his most renowned work in Goodfellas, I could see why he earned such praise. With that said, upon this subsequent viewing of the The Departed I definitely like it a lot more than I did initially. It's the story of two moles: a gangster in the police and a cop in the mob. The two work their opposing bosses into trusting them, but the bosses are on to the fact that there is, indeed, an enemy mole within their own outfits. Violence, deception, drama, and thrills ensue as each mole gets closer to finding the other. In terms of comparison, I'd have to say Infernal Affairs makes for a more entertaining and fast-paced story with its kinetic score and attention to subtlety in both narrative and characters for the viewer to fill in on their own (along with 50 minutes less in running time). On the other hand, Scorsese does a wonderful job in making his version more of a character drama with the elements of the aforementioned on the side and set on the mean streets of South Boston that works very well, though tends to feel a bit cumbersome and underwhelming at times (like the love triangle, the lack of empathy for Nicholson's character compared to his Chinese counterpart, or the overuse of record label songs as opposed to an actual score). However, the film more than makes up for these shortcomings through a wonderful script and some excellent performances with an A-list cast, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, and a very foul-mouthed (though funny to listen to) Mark Wahlberg. Both are excellent movies in their own right that should cater to either side of the spectrum depending your preference for flash and execution vs. grit and progression, though I'd personally lean a little more towards the original just because it doesn't feel as tedious in certain aspects.    Video - 4.5    For being one of the flagship BDs from Warner Brothers' early days into HD home video, the video quality actually looks pretty good. Compared to other flagship titles released from around the same time, in which some of them do or don't still hold up to today's standards, The Departed presents itself very well. The first thing that caught my eye during Nicholson's little prologue speech were the black levels and shadow delineation. As you see his silhouette walking through with a white background behind him, it instantly set the tone for me and made for some lovely foreshadowing to the film's narrative about the deceit, secrets, and hiding to occur throughout. Colors aren't very bold, and are even a bit drab, but still manage to put some real-world depth into the picture making the audience know full well that the grit and dirtiness are there. Blues, grays, and blacks tend to stick out the most in the form of police uniforms, gangster attire, and various low-lit settings, while red tends to show themselves a bit more towards the end when people start getting off'd. Contrast is also excellent and helps to accentuate some very fine textures and facial features from the creases in shirts and lining in suits to the stubble of unshaven mob goons and the wrinkles under their eyes. Overall image detail has a great deal of clarity and sharpness with near-reference quality outside of some artifacts and debris that pop up on occasion and the every-so-often instance of overly red skin tones. But all things considered, audiences should be pleased with the picture quality and that it didn't end up as badly botched as say.. Batman Begins or V for Vendetta was.    Audio - 4.5    Using that memory-eater of a codec in Uncompressed PCM , The Departed outputs at a constant bitrate of 4.6Mbps and sounds just as excellent as one could hope. The movie starts off silent and fades into Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter at a very adequate volume that gives the film some ambiance, but never overpowers Nicholson's opening speech. Dialogue throughout remains clear and discernible from the center channel, and I was very.. amused at how well I could understand those Bostonian accents (still had to turn the subtitles on, just to be safe). Directionality is a bit sparse, but does take advantage of the clarity of lossless audio by giving off some very fine subtleties in sound effects like the opening and closing of doors, the churning of cars plodding down the street, the ringing of telephones across the room, and the approaching footsteps of people off screen. Music varies between a lot of cuts of Gimme Shelter and Dropkick Murphys' I'm Shipping Up to Boston and a little bit of score from Howard Shore here and there. For the most part, it's a fairly music-less sound scape with the dialogue doing most of the work, though gunshots and fist fights make themselves known when need be. Separation is handled perfectly between all of these elements with a lot of the music staying in the front and guns and punches panning between the fronts and rears, most notably during a raid scene towards the end. The only downside to this audio presentation is the lack of any potent LFEs, which obviously don't have very many moments to shine aside from some bass in the music, but it's still a fine movie without them.    Extras - 3.5    With just over 45 minutesof special features, there are two of them presented: one talking about infamous Southie gangster Whitey Bulger (whom Nicholson's character is based on), and another featurette talking about Scorsese's history in film as well as his previous experiences in the gangster genre. The Whitey Bulger segment adds an intriguing sense of realism. There are various interviews with news correspondents, former law enforcement officials, and even former mob men that talk about the scope and influence of Bulger, the power he possessed for almost 30 years, and a little bit of the of stigma a person like him carried around. I'm still a bit new to the gangster genre myself and found this to be a pretty cool piece of information. It wasn't overly factual, but still managed to tell me enough that I could relate it to the movie and give it a more objective view. The Scorsese \\"portfolio\\" segment was a very great watch. Like I said, I'm just now getting into him as a director and it fascinates me to learn about his history growing up, the kinds of films he made, and a lot of the similarities and influences those works share with one another. I see him as being quite charismatic, and I'm a bit disappointed they didn't include a commentary of some sort for the movie itself. Then finally, there are also deleted scenes in SD with introductions for each one. All in all, there aren't a lot of specials in terms of quantity, but I personally enjoyed them for the outright quality.    Overall - 4.5    The Departed is a fine adaptation of Infernal Affairs that really works for western audiences. It's not as flashy or well-executed in terms of screenplay, but it makes up for those losses in gritty atmosphere and more fleshed-out characters. And who better to portray this than a man who's certainly becoming one of my favorite directors in Martin Scorsese. I was shocked that he never won an Oscar prior to this film, but I'm glad to see he got his just due at some point. If you like cop/gangster thrillers, this would probably be near the top of my recommendations (though I would also say you try Infernal Affairs if you don't mind subtitles). With excellent video and audio specs and a good amount of informative extras, The Departed comes highly recommended.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This is a great movie with an even greater picture. It's like watching for the first time again.
B0036TGSRG|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I know the name Roman Polanski, but I'm embarrassed to say this is only the first film of his I've ever seen. My curiosity for this movie was nudged after hearing his name and the names of some very fine actors being involved, namely: Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, and Tom Wilkinson. In watching The Ghost Writer, I had gone in expecting some sort of political thriller along the lines of State of Play (the last political thriller I saw and really, really liked); something with a lot of twists, turns, and deception from every which way until a shocking resolution was reached. Instead, I was completely surprised with a good deal of British charm, wit, and whimsicality involved, and then a little dazzle in the discovery of one Mr. Polanski's talent. The Ghost Writer is, indeed, a thriller that managed to captivate and keep me guessing what would happen next, but in a very odd manner. Usually, when watching political thrillers, or thrillers in general, I've always had this \\"expectancy of complexity\\" factor in which I just about always expected the unexpected to happen, and often. But in experiencing this film, I was surprised at how it achieved the same effect, though in much less flashy theatrics and writing. From the very beginning, we know someone is dead, this ghost is assigned to finish the memoirs of a controversial former Prime Minister, and that things just logically snowball deeper and deeper into conspiracy. However, what surprised me the most was at how well-ground and down-to-earth the screenplay felt. It was very simple in nature, and not at all what I was expecting, and yet I couldn't help but become more and more intrigued by the mysteries that lied therein until everything came to revelation, and the movie was over just as the symbolism of the ghost implies. If Polanski was always this good, then I apologize up-front that I never bothered to discover him in the first place. The drama, sleuthing, and pacing were very enjoyable.    Video - 5.0    You wouldn't think a political thriller would make for much reference-level material, but don't let the generalization fool you. The Ghost Writer looks stunning on BD with a perfect transfer whose simplicity in writing is as deceptively commendable as its photography. Colors offer a wide selection of vibrancy throughout the various locations, sets, and costumes. And as plain as they are, flawless picture reproduction is still flawless. Black levels are deep and equally without fault, providing for some excellent foreshadowing as the film progresses. And speaking of shadows, line/shadow delineation is some of the best I've seen in recent memory (in relation to recent films). There were parts of the movie when McGregor would be sitting and reading in the dark, and the level of depth between his silhouette, the shadows behind him, and the natural lighting from the screen were ridiculously accurate and separated from one another. Contrast and lighting benefit from this very much as well, as apparent in the very fine skin and cloth detail from the gray hairs on Brosnan's head, to the fibers of a bath robe, to the stretch (or plastic surgery) marks on Kim Cattrall's body (have to say, though, she looks pretty good for 54). Sharpness is razor sharp and presents the overall photography with a kind of subtlety worthy of Blu-ray and the hype that comes along with its label of \\"pristine picture.\\" This is definitely a winner, and should get at least an Oscar nomination for cinematography.    Audio - 4.5    Again, political thrillers don't usually instill that, \\"wow, that's going to sound awesome,\\" kind of feeling, but this movie just kept surprising me. Dialogue sounds perfect through the center and all (don't know how anyone can screw that up), and the script/acting come off very well to help the carry the plot. My biggest surprise, though, is in the score. Alexandre Desplat's compositions completely caught me off guard. They're not bad or anything, but the instrumentation and overall ambiance just really kept me into the film for some reason. It'd be something tense and suspenseful at one moment with a bunch of strings, and then all of a sudden transition into an almost goofy set of drums, woodwinds, and brass that, strangely, still had the right sense of setting a tone. I really don't know how to explain the feeling I got from his work, but it seemed off, yet oddly satisfying. As for sound effects, a lot of it is left to a particular kind of ambiance as well. The effects are relatively just there in the background, like cars driving on gravel, rainfall, ocean waves, the wind, or various creaks and taps on the furniture, but it makes for a great mix, regardless of their frivolities. I think my subwoofer went to standby once or twice from the inactivity of LFEs, so that should be pretty self-explanatory. For a film like this, though, you don't really need them.    Extras - 3.5    Not a whole lot of special features here other than an interview with the author of the original novel, Robert Harris (who is also the screenwriter for the film), interviews with the four main actors in what they thought about working with Polanski, and then an interview with Polanski himself, all of which are presented in HD. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that, while the extras themselves don't amount to much in terms of quantity (just under 30 minutes), I still very much enjoyed the quality of them, mainly because this is the only thing I've ever come to see or hear about in relation to Roman Polanski and the notoriety that comes with his name as a director. From what I've heard about him, I get this image that he's a highly-renowned and very well-respected director that's something of an icon in the industry. And after hearing these comments about him, I'd even go to say the general consensus is to call him a sort of living legend. From his demeanor and the quality of work shown in this film, I can certainly see why he's earned a lot of this praise, and I'm very curious to play catchup on his career now. With that being said, I thought the extras also helped to add a decent amount of depth to the characters, plot, and filming process, though obviously they could've been longer or more fully-explained. I also would've loved to have heard an audio commentary by Polanski and Harris for the film, but too bad, I guess. Despite these shortcomings, I was pleased to be enlightened about Polanski's image in general.    Overall - 4.5    The Ghost Writer certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's a thriller, yes, but it's nowhere near as fancy or flashy as a gangster, cop, or espionage entry into the genre. It's a much more simplistic, logical, almost humdrum kind of thriller filled with witty characters and tout dialogue, but could still be entertaining if you're in to this type of film. I'd never seen a Polanski film till now, but I'm proud to say I'm damn curious to see some more. With reference video, near-reference audio, and a pretty short, though very informative, set of extras (for me, anyway), I highly recommend this BD for fans of the movie. Others may want to give it a rent to see if it fits their preferences, first.
B000031WI8|5.0|Wham! no doubt was one of the most successful pop acts of the 80s even though they released only 3 studio albums and their fame lasted only for 4 years (1982-1986). The reason for their success was probably George Michael's singer-songwriter qualities which proved to be too good for the band and led to his solor career (George Michael's first solo album, \\"Faith\\" was the best-selling album of 1987). This collection contains all of the band's greates hits including their rare early hits Wham Rap, Young Guns and Bad Boys. I own \\"The Edge of Heaven\\", another version of Wham's greatest hits which do not have these songs. The Edge of Heaven collection also excludes \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Everything She Wants\\" both of which are included in this collection. If you are a fan of the 80s music or even curious about the 80s sound, you will do well buying this collection because it really defines the 80s pop sound. Wham's singles were always upbeat, catchy tunes with memorable melodies and lyrics, such as \\"Last Christmas I gave you my heart but the very next day, you gave it away...\\" a song that you will still hear on the radio come Christmas. Or Careless Whisper \\"Time can never mend, a careless whisper of a good friend\\" - the ultimate 80s anthem for slow ballad. The only song that is not on this album but on \\"The Edge of Heaven\\" is \\"Blue\\" but this doesn't reduce the value of this collection. If you are interested in Wham/George Michael's music, I'd also suggest DVD collection [[ASIN:B000JFY16A George Michael: Twenty Five]].
B0024FAG5I|5.0|Movie - 4.5    Something I've always liked about a majority of Sam Raimi's films is their ability to entertain. The Evil Dead movies, Darkman, the Spider-man trilogy, and Drag Me to Hell are all filled with just the right balance of quirks, style, and enough story/character depth to keep me engrossed within those universes. The Quick and the Dead is something of a divergence from all of Raimi's other fantasy-based action titles. There's no magic book, ghouls, radioactive spiders, crazed supervillains, or goat demons coming for your soul in this. It's a straight-up revenge-themed spaghetti western brimming with characters, drama, and good ole fashioned shootouts. There are three things in particular I think make this a very entertaining film. First, is Sharon Stone. I was only a kid when Sharon Stone was \\"hot stuff\\" in Hollywood, and I didn't really know what that meant at the time (having not figured out the \\"birds and the bees\\" yet). But wow, after seeing this and what little bits I can remember of her throughout her other mid-'90s titles, I can certainly see the kind of sex appeal she had. Having her as the protagonist does double for me in that 1) it gives me some great eye candy, and 2) perpetuates my all-time favorite theme in vengeance (and through a sexy vessel, at that). The second thing I really like is the rest of the cast. With established and eventual talent like Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Gary Sinise, Pat Hingle, Lance Henriksen, and Keith David, it's an unequivocal star-studded lineup, each of who play their respective personalities to the best of their abilities and to the limits they have written on paper. And lastly, by far my favorite aspect of the movie is the photography. Dante Spinotti's angular framing and quick zooming really give the film a kind of cinematic flare and pizazz, something you just don't see anymore in a lot of westerns. While the narrative is pretty cookie-cutter and the characters fairly one-dimensional, it's an entertaining piece of fiction, nonetheless.    Video - 4.0    Prior to this BD viewing, my experiences with Q&D is pretty limited to either cable TV or VHS, so it's safe to say I have little source material to use for comparison. But for what it is today, Sony presents Q&D with a very good picture presentation. Colors range between not-quite-dull and purposely-washed-out, but make for some great aesthetic choices. There's an especially subtle hint of orange during scenes with either lots of sand in the background or sunlight shining on peoples' faces for that dramatic effect. Image detail overall is pretty sharp with healthy levels of contrast and blacks that never seem to crush or distract. Set design, costuming, and prop work are probably the elements that will stick out the most, adding a very authentic feel to the film. The are some artifacts and debris here and there, but it's nothing overly messy in relation to other titles I've seen on BD from around that time.    Audio - 4.5    Growing up, my interpretation of westerns had always been of a sheriff versus a bandit in some kind of gunslinger's duel outside of a tavern or just at the edge of town at either dawn or dusk. With this movie, I get just that, and plenty of it. As more of escapist entertainment than any kind of meaningful story, Q&D's main drive is through its action sequences and tension building up to those moments. With that said, the sound design benefits a lot from this TrueHD track. Background noise throughout the saloons and town activities flood the front and rear speakers, while dead silence casts a suspenseful grip in the moments before a quick draw. Dialogue is perfect and never gets muffled through all the action, with separation being especially nice. The score by Alan Silvestri helps to maintain a nice pace to the film and really gives it that old-school \\"western\\" feel with a good amount of brass and guitar. Gunshots are easily the showcase of the track, providing with as quick andprecise a sound as the drawers themselves. Horse hooves on the dirt, saloon doors, spurs jingling, even the clicking of hammers all possess a very clear reproduction of sound. The only thing lacking, really, is a strong presence of LFEs. Around the end of the movie there's one scene that really triggers the sub, but it doesn't do enough to give the overall track a real balance. Still, though, everything else is pretty near-reference.    Overall - 4.5    I still haven't seen a whole lot of westerns to this date. Stuff like Unforgiven and 3:10 to Yuma make for some great story-telling, while stuff like Appoloosa and The Quick and the Dead make more for quick entertainment. But regardless, I have to say westerns do have their charm. Q&D is a short, little film that manages to entertain me to great bounds thanks in huge part to Sam Raimi's direction, the production design team, and a really great cast of actors. The video is very good, and the sound is excellent. The Quick and the Dead comes highly recommended.
B002RKS3Z0|3.0|Were it not for the board game [[ASIN:1589942108 Arkham Horror]], I would never have heard of [[ASIN:1589943368 The King in Yellow]]. Tantalized by its concept - a play that drives anyone who reads it insane - and encouraged by the knowledge that H. P. Lovecraft had read it, I dove eagerly into the book. I am pleased to report that it did not drive me mad.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002RKS3Z0 The King in Yellow]] is a collection of ten loosely connected short stories - the first few reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe with a distinct focus on the King in Yellow, his yellow sign, and his play; the remainder more romantic, less macabre, and sharing only a common character or setting with the stories preceding. At times the work has an engaging and modern feel; at others one is reminded of bad English novels and bored children listening to ghost stories by a campfire. Still, I found the overall experience enjoyable.<br /><br />Because of its disjointed nature, it is hard to recommend this book to anyone - it simply has no target audience! Completist fans of the Cthulhu Mythos should definitely give it a read but horror enthusiasts may be disappointed.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Movie - 4.5    Yet another film I never got around to watching in theaters, but still a piece of work that I ended up liking a lot, Kick-Ass really caught me by surprise with the mishmash of elements it possessed in both writing and production. Initially, the trailer for this movie had me thinking it would be more along the lines of a satire, which it kind of is, but it's also a representation of the superhero genre as well as a parody in and of itself (think Edgar Wright and his work with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz). While not any one aspect of the film overpowers the other, I think there are enough of them to cater to a multitude of audiences. Kick-Ass is the story of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an average teenager with average problems who likes to read comics, becomes a self-made, wannabe superhero, and within this life, comes to realize its hazards, while also trying to impress a girl at school (Lyndsy Fonseca). He meets two true superheroes in Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and adventure ensues as they try to bring down big-time mobster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). For me personally, I found the main theme to be a coming-of-age story. Dave has a good heart and wants to do good things (and get laid), but ultimately isn't much of a superhero, later realizing he wasn't really cut out for the gig. His character is sympathetic and very relatable, in my opinion, and does a great job propelling the audience into all kinds of other aspects. In addition to Dave's self-discovery, the film also has various instances of dark and raunchy comedy, character drama, vengeance and redemption, and brutal, stylized violence, of which the last is probably the most controversial in the form of 11 year-old Moretz's depiction for her character. However, if anything else, this particular aspect of the film will probably wow most people over because it really is a great performance with enough of a message (if you want to interpret one), while also beingescapist entertainment at its best. I just wish the movie were a little longer to flesh out the characters a bit more, but we'll see if they expand upon that in the sequel.    Video - 4.0    I swear I thought something was wrong with the transfer upon my initial viewing. Colors seem vibrant enough, but become way overblown at times, while black levels were inconsistent, crushed, and on occasion shades of blue. Contrast was affected as well by those fluctuating blacks and resulted in lost detail and smeared textures. But after watching the extras, I found out it was all intentional. You see, in the comics the ink artist was told that he wasn't to use the color black.. ever. Looking at some of the pictures from the comic, it certainly makes for a much more peculiar type of art style, but what looks good on paper doesn't always necessarily translate well to the film medium. While the grain thing may have worked for Zack Snyder and 300, colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness still had an amazing amount of depth, detail, and delineation through his cinematography. But here, a lot of the uniqueness seems to work more against the picture than for it. The best examples I can use for comparison are the scenes where Big Daddy raids the lumber factory and the one where Hit Girl is trying to save him and Kick-Ass. In the raid scene, you get a really good look at his costume from a variety of angles. You think it'd be a black, Batman-type suit with a black shotgun in his hands, right? Well, neither of them are black, they're \\"Off-Black.\\" Who's ever heard of the color \\"Off-Black?\\" Black is supposed to be black. But then in the rescue scene when the lights are shot out, the pitch black darkness is as black as the abyss of death (or whatever scary, black allusion you can think of). There were actual blacks within the cinematography here, and they were absolutely perfect. It's just a shame the rest of the film wasn't as clean. Kudos to DP, Ben Davis, and the color department for trying preserve the intended look and integrity of the comic, though.    Audio - 5.0    Sure the video is a bit questionable, but the audio has no issues, whatsoever. The DTS-HD 7.1 track is relatively underused in the presence of dialogue, which sounds perfect and un-muddled, by the way. But when action and ambiance occur, it's quite the technical nugget. Directionality consists of a mixed bag and presents itself mainly through the use of music and whatever sound effects are present on-screen. Things like cars, city noise, and crowd chatter do what's expected of them in terms of proper placement and panning, while the more aggressive sounds like hits, cuts, thuds, and gunshots have a tendency to disperse through any one of the other six surround channels when the moment calls for them. Musical accompaniment and songs from a wide variety of artists and the four composers who worked on this film do a splendid job adding pace and mood, particularly the John Williams Superman homage in Kick-Ass' theme and the Zimmer/Howard Joker theme used build tension at one point. Separation of said effects and music are spot-on, never letting the dialogue get lost. A few great reference scenes would be the aforementioned Big Daddy raid and Hit Girl rescue, or even the final scene where Hit Girl invades D'Amico's headquarters, as there's quite a bit of action and gunshot activity throughout each. LFEs aren't too frequent, but really make themselves known in the form of heavier rounds being fired and through the occasional explosion, burning flame, or bass rhythm. Don't be fooled by the majority of a front-heavy presentation at the beginning. Things will unfold as they should.    Extras - 5.0    Kick-Ass is loaded with special features. I literally spent 6 hours watching every single feature on the disc: the movie, the movie with P-i-P commentary (skipped the audio one since it's excerpted from the Bonus View Mode), and then the 2-hour making-of featurette (actually a little over 2 hours, if you combine it with the \\"history of the comic\\" feature). So this Bonus View thing is apparently Lionsgate's answer to Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode. A window for the commentary takes up the screen with director Matthew Vaughn sitting there in a studio watching the movie (which plays on your screen in the bottom corner), while bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage is mixed in with his comments. It's damn informative in a lot of aspects from the pre-production, filming, and post-production phases down to the challenges faced in making the whole thing. Vaughn presents himself well and seems to be really proud of what he accomplished, given a lot of problems that occurred and the fact that they only had a $28 million dollar budget. It's a mix between business-oriented and kick-back commentary on the project and manages to be a very engaging experience. On the other hand, the making-of feature doesn't recycle a thing from the Bonus View Mode and is all fresh material. It essentially covers more of the overall production of the film from beginning to end in great detail and has various interviews, excerpts, and events to really show the viewer how much freakin' work they put into it. Then finally, there's a 20-minute feature talking about the comic, what Mark Millar wanted to do with it, how John Romita Jr. went about drawing it, and all that other stuff. It's truly an exhausting set of extras, but if you ever wanted to know anything about Kick-Ass in either movie or comic form, the Blu-ray is where you need to look.    Overall - 4.5    This movie was a big surprise for me. Most comic book adaptations to the big screen tend to have fairly linear narratives, an understood formula for storytelling, and plausible protagonists. Kick-Ass is kind of a warped version of these elements, though oddly enough still manages to tell the same kind of story. Its style and overall structure may divide audiences a bit and feel more like a cult favorite compared to themore mainstream franchises, but I personally enjoyed the movie for its quirkiness (a little bit of Vaughn's residual days working on Lock, Stock and Snatch, perhaps?). With a somewhat underwhelming video transfer, perfect audio, and a boatload of extras, Kick-Ass comes highly recommended, especially for fans.
B002IVLH60|5.0|wouhhhhh excellent album , estupendo, after a few listenings , one of my favourite pearl jam's album
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Movie - 4.5    Out of all the Scorsese films I've seen in the past decade or so (let's say, from Gangs of New York and up), I have to say Shutter Island is certainly the most surprising. Like a lot of people do, I'm sure the mere mention of the director's name is, more often than not, associated with gangster movies or gritty character dramas. But here, he delves into something new - a psychological thriller. Shutter Island follows U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) to the aforementioned facility for the criminally insane, in which he's been asked to help find an escaped patient. During his investigation, he stumbles upon revelations and discoveries that lead to even more mysteries as he starts to question the true intentions of Dr. Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley), the rest of the staff, and even his own partner (Mark Ruffalo). But with dreams and broken pieces of his past beginning to haunt him, paranoia, distrust, and denial are bound to distract his attention and twist his beliefs. Without spoiling the plot, Shutter Island is an excellent film set in the 1950s with an old-school detective feel to it that manages, not only to intrigue, but also present a good deal of empathy for the characters (something Scorsese excels at). In addition, it also manages to put something into perspective that I've never quite appreciated, and that's the acting ability of one Leonardo DiCaprio. I didn't particularly care for any of his roles in the '90s outside of The Quick and the Dead, but ever since seeing him in this, I've been playing catchup from Gangs of New York till now, and I have to say he's certainly developed into a fine actor with a lot of screen presence and charisma. Equally supportive of his work in the film, though, are some stellar supporting performances by Sir Kingsley, Ruffalo, and what little parts there are for Max von Sydow and Jackie Earle Haley. Shutter Island is a great psychological mystery/thriller that managed to keep me suspended from beginningto end and also has a good deal of replay value as well. You'll know what I mean when you see it.    Video - 5.0    By far the best quality of this video presentation is the colors. I was amazed at how vibrant the different shades of primaries were from scene to scene and in-between reality and Teddy's memories/dreams. From the cold and murky flashbacks of his days during the war and the snow-covered fields that covered the dozens of corpses in his path to the bright yellows and oranges of his wife's dress and their apartment, Robert Richardson's eye-popping photography makes for an equally tripped-out vision of the many layers residing in the film's visual progression. Black levels and contrast are perfect, giving the movie that dark and gritty Scorsese feel, but also complimenting the atmospherics. The fine lines in clothing, the blades of grass and lush tree leaves in the courtyard, and all the little cracks and crevices within the island's surrounding rocks and cliffs look astonishing. This is by far the prettiest gritty picture I've seen from Scorsese yet and is something I'm very pleased with. One of my favorite shots is the scene where Teddy and Chuck (Ruffalo) are standing on the cliff with the deputy warden looking down at the water. I'm not sure whether or not the clouds and background behind them were green screened, but something about that shot just feels dark, spooky, and ominous and very befitting for the kind of movie this is. The picture is pristine and free of any artifacts or debris and shows no signs of any kind of manipulation whatsoever. Here's hoping to the same kind of quality for Scorsese's future projects.    Audio - 5.0    Complimenting the reference video is an equally reference audio track. While it's certainly lacking overall LFEs, I have to say I absolutely love what it does for general atmospherics and ambiance, regardless. Robbie Robertson's music supervision and use of pre-recorded compositions from various sources does a splendidjob from the very beginning with the foghorn piece to string, brass, and other classical pieces played throughout. Dialogue is especially crisp with its varying amounts of indoor-voice, whisper, and scream volumes and never becomes muddled or lost in the music. Directionality of sound effects disperse themselves from the fronts and rears adding that extra sense of calm and craziness when need be in the form of screaming patients, storm noises outside the facility, metal doors slamming shut, waves washing ashore, birds chirping during the daytime, wind howling at night, the crackling of a fireplace in Dr. Cawley's study, and the dripping of water droplets within the silent tension of Ward C. Separation of said effects, music, and dialogue never bog one another down and really help to showcase the wonders of, yet, another commendable lossless track. While this probably won't hold up to the sound designs of modern day blockbusters, it was perfect enough for me and works very well with the subject matter of the plot.    Extras - 3.0    Shutter Island only comes with a mere 38 minutes of behind-the-scenes interviews from the cast, crew, author of the novel, and a mental health consultant. In the first vignette they explain bits and pieces of how the film came to fruition from book to movie, what Scorsese wanted to do with it, and a little bit of the actual filming process like set design and music. The second feature focuses more on the medical perspective and history of mental health from back in those days and talks about the transition that was occurring at the time, how the practice evolved between then and now, and the accuracy of how it's depicted within the film itself. While an audio commentary or a more in-depth look at how the movie was made would've been nice, the extras still provide a good deal of information about the story's themes and really helped me, personally, understand the kind of perseverance and dedication it takes to be a mental health professional. But given how fascinated I've recently become with Scorsese and his approach to film-making, I really wish Paramount had gone all out with a whole second disc of extras and one or two commentaries, at least. As much as I hate to double-dip, I actually wouldn't mind doing it for this, pending on what they might add.    Overall - 4.5    I took the film to be something more along the lines of a conspiracy thriller when I first saw the trailer, which it is in some fashion. But the big twist at the end really threw me in a loop and caught me by surprise. Some people may find this too \\"different\\" from the norm of Scorsese, but I found it quite refreshing and very entertaining at the same time. Shutter Island is certainly a mystery, but also a finely-crafted thriller that will more than likely have you duped the first time around. Thankfully, it has a lot of replay value and should make more sense a second or third time through. With reference A/V quality, though a much-to-be-desired set of extras, Shutter Island comes highly recommended.
B0025VLELQ|3.0|It was surprising to see the difference between the technologies of the 80's versus current day.  What was considered to be great graphics back then would be laughed off the screen today.  This is even more apparent in the Blu-ray version where the graphics look very much pasted onto the screen with no real interaction between what was in the background and the graphics itself.  Things that \\"exploded\\" like the alien base, merely disappeared when the scene returns to it later in the movie.<br />  Saying that, it was nice to revisit and get a taste of the 80's again, however I wouldn't recommend getting this in Blu-ray as the graphics contrast is too great.  The DVD would be sufficient to enjoy the movie for what it was, a good family movie with a little humor (especially the fashions and hairstyles of the 80's) as well as an old fashioned story plot where a teenager, coming of age realizes that he doesn't have to be stuck in his current situation, he can always break free and save the world(s).
B0025KW29U|5.0|Movie 5.0    I was first introduced to the existence of Dr. Horrible a couple of years ago during the summer of '08 when the writer's strike was still in effect. I was instant messaging with a friend of mine in California when she mentioned something called \\"Dr. Horrible,\\" and she wouldn't leave me alone because I had no idea what she was talking about. So she found me some streaming links of the show, I watched them, and found them thoroughly amusing. A year later, I finally discovered Joss Whedon's masterpiece in Firefly and its man-child Serenity, developing a new respect that is probably more prevalent in the rampant fandom out there than anything else. And another year after that, in only my second viewing of Dr. Horrible I think I'm starting to see why Joss has so many fans. Dr. Horrible is an oddity, to say the least. Its short running time, low-budget roots, Internet crowd, and yet addicting quirkiness have come to entertain millions of people. But with star power like Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day, is it any surprise? While only running a mere 42 minutes (the equivalent of a single TV series episode), I find it amazing how so much comedy, drama, and tragedy were crammed in. And to top it all of, it's a musical, but not just any musical, a supervillain musical! Such subtle emotions like love, hope, and a greater calling to do good (or horrible) things is just one of the many characteristics I think any person goes through, be they regular Joe's or aspiring super people. NPH, in all of his natural charisma, plays the role of Dr. Horrible flawlessly. I never watched Doogie Howser growing up, but the \\"cool guy\\" image he's had ever since Harold & Kumar has been a joy to watch. Nathan Fillion is essentially an egomaniac superhero that, if you're any familiar with his work in the Firefly universe, makes for some great comedy relief. And finally, Felicia Day plays the cute damsel and love interest of the two with great, uh.. cuteness. Props to her for a beautiful singing voice, too. If you've yet to see this, Dr. Horrible is an over-the-top, silly, and wacky musical satire concoction that's short in length, but certainly a winner.    Video - 4.0    Being a made-for-Internet production and filmed in a total of two weeks, you'd think something low-budget like Dr. Horrible wouldn't translate well to BD. But in fact, it actually looks pretty good. The color scheme doesn't amount itself to much outside of Dr. Horrible's lab coat, Captain Hammer's black t-shirt, and various amounts of street clothes, but image detail is still quite good. Skin textures are relatively tight, and contrast levels give the overall picture a kind of cartoony look. On the flip side, there's also a lot of noise in the darker or more dimly-lit scenes, and a few instances of artifacts/debris pop up every now and then. There's also the issue of contrast getting blown out of proportion during the \\"special effects\\" sequences, like when a giant Dr. Horrible is wreaking havoc on the city. But given that the budget was probably half the cost of some sports cars, I think it looks great.    Audio - 4.5    Dr. Horrible is presented with a very excellent DTS-HD 5.1 track that better captures the true essence of the show. Dialogue is clean-cut from the center channel with what few, if any, sound effects coming mainly from the front sound stage. But the real star of the show (the music) is phenomenally delivered and dispersed throughout every speaker. Accompaniment itself actually has a decent amount of separation from the vocals resulting in a fine representation of the show's soundtrack. High and low ends of the music/vocals never waver and almost make you think it should just be an audio BD. Integration of the pre-recorded songs to the video are flawless as well, and the BD as a whole really does justice to the musical numbers. The only downside, really, is the lack of LFEs. There is one point in the show where something blows up making for a quick little rumble, but that's it. Certainly, the music sounds as good as it ever will, though.    Extras - 5.0    Comes with 2 commentaries, making-of, Evil League of Evil application videos, outtakes, and a brief interview with the ELE itself. Probably the funniest and most innovative special I've experienced yet, though, is the musical commentary. Whedon and gang actually went through the trouble of composing and constructing songs and dialogue in a semi-Broadway fashion to fill in pretty much every single second of the feature's run time. Dialogue is high-pitched and fast just like you'd hear on stage, and a lot of the songs are quite entertaining, yet perfectly comprehensible as potential standalone commentaries themselves. It's just as strange, quirky, and fun as the show itself. Also of high entertainment value are the ELE applications. Much of the applicants are very creative considering these are low-budget and fan-made, and I think it's awesome that Whedon was cool enough to actually put them on the disc. The making-of is only about 20 minutes, but provides quite a bit of insight to the composition of the idea, the music, and the casting. Rounding it all out is a painfully short ELE interview, which is funny in its own right, but I would've loved more Fake Thomas Jefferson and Dead (David) Bowie screen time. All in all, the extras are a joy to watch and compliment the feature very well.    Overall - 4.5    In the last couple of years, Joss Whedon has really managed to capture my attention with his brilliant attention to quirkiness. First was Firefly and Serenity, and now now Dr. Horrible. The comedy is subtle, snarky, and genuinely funny all at the same time. With outstanding performances by the main three cast and a very catchy soundtrack, Dr. Horrible became an Internet sensation, and rightfully so. Presented by New Video with adequate video, excellent audio, and all the goofy extras that were on the DVD, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog comes highly recommended an is a must-have for Whedonites.
B000RZGIQ8|2.0|I'm going to get right to the point. First off this is a great movie especially if the F-14 is your favorite aircraft. However the picture looks the same as it did when I used to watch this on a 19\\" inch TV in the late 80's on a rented VHS tape. Paramount should be ashamed, this is not even close to 720 let alone 1080. I have old DVD's that offer a better picture in the bluray player then this. Yes it does have a cool menu but the picture is NOT high-Def and the sound is only acceptable when you put the setting on 6.1 DTS Master (only reason I gave 2-stars). If you do not have a good external speaker system do not waste your money because the picture and the sound won't be worth it.
B003ELMR9E|5.0|Movie - 4.5    When I first saw the trailer for this some years ago, I thought it would turn into something along the lines of a cold and calculated murder mystery, a genre I'm sure Nolan would excel at if he took another shot at making one (a la Memento). Instead, I was presented with a complex character drama in addition to a back and forth trade-off of psychological mind games between the most unlikely duo I would ever have thought possible. Al Pacino is a given with his extensive track record and undeniable screen presence. His tact, detail to the little things, and natural vigor has always made him a great actor to watch on screen. But my biggest surprise was in Robin Williams. I've not seen his work in One Hour Photo, but his character in this film is definitely the darkest and most poignantly disturbing role I've seen him do to date. At times he's like a ticking time-bomb of undistilled rage and mounting frustration just waiting to explode. And yet, for a very good majority of his screen time he displays an almost creepy sense of control that manages to keep him aloof just when you think it's over. His character's natural ability of observation and the twisted kind of logic he possesses make for a great game of cat and mouse that keeps you suspended till the very end. The parallels between their personalities, the circumstances that brought them together, and the raw tension that propels them both to the point of breaking are all part of another finely-woven web that has a little bit of everything I like in a detective story. And while in somewhat of a limited role, Hilary Swank provides for a great sense of conscience and perspective in opposition to the insomniac behaviors of both Pacino and Williams' characters. I was surprised at how brisk the movie progressed having only seen it for the first time as of this review. It's a dark and very well-written piece of psychological thriller with just the right balance of drama and emotion.    Video - 4.5    As mentioned above, this BD is actually my first-ever viewing of the film. And while I don't have any theatrical or DVD experiences in mind for comparison, I still have to say the film looks wonderful. Wally Pfister's photography gets an excellent transfer, with bold, bold colors being the highlight of the video. From the very beginning of the movie when Pacino's character is flying over the mountains of Alaska (or wherever they filmed in British Columbia), we get a crystal clear image full of depth and detail. The aforementioned colors look especially lush throughout the countryside showcasing an array of greens, browns, and grays for that very laid-back Alaskan outdoorsy look. Black levels are deep and inky, while contrast is proportioned perfectly to give certain scenes ample dramatic and photographic effect. Skin tones remain very natural exposing a good deal of facial features from the wrinkles of a worn-down Pacino to the eerie smile on Williams' face when we get that side shot of him on the ferry. Overall image detail maintains a faithful and accurate level of sharpness for a lot of the indoor settings and is marred by little bit of edge enhancement, but isn't too distracting. My only gripe for an otherwise perfect picture is the period of frame-shaking during the funeral scene, but everything else is relatively flawless.    Audio - 4.5    Much like the video, I found the audio to be excellent as well. While a good majority of the film is dialogue, what few instances there are of surround usage via background noise, ambient town activity, running water, shuffling footsteps, or creaking wood, do their fair share of creating a deceptively buoyant DTS-HD track. Separation of said noises does a great job panning across the screen just as you'd see/hear them from the perspective of the camera. Directionality doesn't get a whole lot of work, but does so admirably when given the opportunity. A lot of it is done mainly through the sounds of nature and in combination with atense, and sometimes haunting, score by David Julyan. But perhaps my favorite element, though to no surprise considering its rudimentary requirement, is the dialogue. Pacino, in conjunction to his unique acting, also has that very distinct raspy voice, which I have to say couldn't sound more perfect, especially for this type of movie. Meanwhile, Williams with a much more low-key performance, voice-wise, sounds equally impressive be it on screen or over the phone (again, it's creepy to hear him be.. so creepy). And for as good as the track sounds, the one detractor would have to be the LFEs. They're not bad, by any means, but for the limitations of what the movie is, their just isn't a whole lot of instances where strong bass is required outside of music and the occasional dramatic boom effect for the insomnia kicking in.    Extras - 4.0    There actually isn't a big abundance of production features aside from the set design and cinematography pieces, but they're informative enough about a lot of the technical side of things: locations chosen, things they had to build for said locations, types of filming techniques used to counteract elements of nature, and so on. There's also a quaint face-to-face conversation between Nolan and Pacino where Pacino basically gives pointers and little lessons he learned throughout his years of acting to Nolan, who seems very interested in the veteran's words. However, the real meat lies in the very informative commentaries: one by Nolan for the film itself and then one mishmash of selected scenes/commentaries by Hilary Swank and other members of the production crew. By far amongst the more interestingly arranged commentaries I've seen to date, Nolan gives insight for the entire project by going in the order of shooting, rather than the order of editing. What the production features lack in depth, Nolan more than makes up for it by explaining various aspects such as shooting, writing, casting, editing, and a wealth of other very informative tidbits relevant to the film. The scene-specific commentaries add some extra depth and perspective, mostly from a writing and shooting point, but are worth giving a listen to as well. Personally, though, I would've loved to have see a longer, more candid interview with Williams and hear the kinds of things he did to prepare for the role, as well as what he thought of his character, etc.    Overall - 4.5    I have to admit, as widely known as he is for his more mainstream titles (like The Prestige, Batman, and Inception), I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Insomnia. It's an excellent combination of the calculated thriller aspects most people know him for, but also for, in my opinion, an equally excellent amount of character and psychological elements. For what handful of movies I've seen him in (still need to catch up on his classics), I never get tired of Al Pacino. And for always being the funny guy, I'm shocked at how good of a performance Robin Williams provided as well. With near-reference A/V quality and a great set of extras heralded by a very hearty Nolan commentary, Insomnia comes highly recommended.
075666733X|4.0|Upon my first browse-through of &#34;The Complete Human Body,&#34; my initial impression was that it was an updated version of DK 2007 release [[ASIN:0756628652 The Human Body Book (Book & DVD)]] (referred to as THBB from now on), but twice as large. Having spent some time to actually explore the book more thoroughly, that view hasn't changed much.<br /><br />First off, this book is MASSIVE. If you've owned any of DK's other &#34;definitive visual guides&#34; you know what to expect. The book is broken into five main parts: Integrated Body, Anatomy, How The Body Works, Life Cycle, and Diseases And Disorders. Like the other Definitive Visual Guides, The Complete Human Body is divided into two and four-page thematic spreads. The book utilizes a combination of computer models, medical imagery, and traditional drawings in depicting the inner workings of the human body.<br /><br />The biggest improvement from THBB lies in the Anatomy section, which occupies half of the book. The first section focuses on overall views of different body systems, with detailed spreads on the structure of bones, ligaments, veins, skin, etc. The Anatomy Atlas divides the body into seven main regions, each of the systems within that region depicted in a two-page spread. In the case of the skeletal and muscular systems, posterior and anterior views are provided. The depiction of muscles is especially well done, with views of deep and superficial muscles of the anterior and posterior in each region. Views of the major organs, close-ups of various structures, and MRI scans are also included in this part.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many of the illustrations in the rest of the book are simply rehashed from THBB, and much of the thematic content from that book is reproduced here rearranged and rewritten. The Diseases and Disorders section is the biggest offender in that regard - at least 80% of the illustrations come straight from THBB. That's not to say this book isn't an impressively detailed reference work, and in some ways is actually superior to The Human Body Book. The anatomical illustrations are all larger, more detailed, and feature better textures, the page layouts are cleaner and easier to understand, and considering the book's size, there's quite a bit of content not found in THBB, especially in &#34;How The Body Works.&#34;<br /><br />As a visual guide to the human body and it's functions, this an excellent book, but as a revised edition of The Human Body Book, it seems a little rushed. I bought my copy of the latter in September 2007, and can't help but feel this would have been a better book if DK held off another year. If you don't already own THBB, The Complete Human Body is worth the price Amazon is currently asking. If you DO own a copy, you might want to hold off a while.actually superior to The Human Body Book.

B003HARV4S|4.0|Movie - 4.5<br /><br />The Illusionist is something of an oddity. Though it may have gotten lost in the shadow of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige and coincidentally center around the same theme of magic, the two really don't share much else in common. Nolan's film is a calculated and theatrically-charged mystery/thriller, while Burger's is more a romantic drama with a big twist at the end. Overall, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, regardless of the trivial comparative controversy between the two. Several reasons I like this film are because of its cast, simplicity, and of course that big twist ending. Edward Norton plays the role of a regular guy in love with royalty (Jessica Biel) who, despite her being \\"socially engaged\\" to a very villainous prince (played brilliantly by Rufus Sewell), loves him back just as much. Within these events, Paul Giamatti plays the role of an up and coming candidate for police commissioner under the Prince's new regime, but is ultimately a man caught between the future of his reputation and doing what he feels is right. The simplicity of the narrative lies in its characters, their emotions, and a very fine script to bring it all about. It's apparent the two lovers really feel for each other, that the villain truly is a villain, and that somewhere in-between the one man watching all of this unfold is genuinely conflicted with what he should do. With that being said, the film is quite character-driven and builds upon some very basic emotions to tell its story. As we're introduced to them from the beginning of their relationships as children and up to the present, it makes for a refreshing tale of love, loyalty, and longevity. By film's end, I was nearly disappointed with how things were turning out. But the last 90 seconds literally transforms the movie into, what I thought was, a dazzling and ingenious turn of events that made all 100 minutes prior worth the title's namesake.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is something of a unique situation. It's not flashy or bright by any means, but instead uses (or so I hear) a sepia tone lens, which explains the heavy amounts of darkened browns, tans, and deep, deep blacks. Personally, I like how it fits with that particular time period and setting. It doesn't make much for Blu-ray showcasing, but aesthetically speaking, I think it adds a sense of surrealism to the screenplay and overall plot. Colors are there, though not very vibrant at all, and the monochromatic palette is sure to divide videophiles who might be mistaking this for a bad transfer. But rest assured, it's not. As mentioned, black levels are very deep and benefit greatly from the type of photography used. Contrast suffers as a result, obviously, but image detail is still quite good. Sharpness of objects get a little lost in longer shots, but a lot of the film's closeup shots show some serviceable textures and skin hues, particularly in Giamatti's beard and Biel's flushed cheeks. There also don't appear to any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR. For what the movie is and considering the kind of content it involves, it's certainly good enough, though nothing to write home about compared to other dramas I've seen.<br /><br />Audio - 4.0<br /><br />Much like it's visual presentation, the audio is equally reserved, but accurate enough to warrant some merit. The DTS-HD track for this film very subdued and relies heavily on just two elements: the dialogue and score. Dialogue is very well-enunciated. Taking place in Vienna, I was a little disappointed in some of the linguistic authenticity, being that I didn't believe any one character was actually Austrian, but that's okay. The acting itself and the excellent script sound great through the center channel. I felt as if I was almost watching some kind of stage play, what with the picture framing and audio giving it that \\"silent, but understood\\" feeling. The score by Philip Glass is fairly low key, but does a wonderful job enhancing the more emotional and plot-driven scenes. What little sound effects there are disperse and direct themselves accordingly, though are very limited to either horse hooves on the ground, the grinding wheels of a carriage, or crowd noise in and outdoors with some decent separation provided amongst the rears, as well as some panning across the front speakers. There's one scene where the Prince is practicing with a shotgun that really wakes you up, but that's about as loud as it gets. LFEs are next to non-existent, as I'm pretty sure I heard my subwoofer go to standby on multiple occasions. Again, it's not going to wow your guests, but it's serviceable enough.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />I was really surprised at how well this movie turned out. It managed to psychologically suck me into its plot from the very start, and then provide me with a great amount of emotional satisfaction in all but 90 seconds at the end. After hearing so much controversy between this and The Prestige, I have to say any and all comparisons are, indeed, unwarranted and needless outside of the one theme they have in common: magic. Other than using magic as a driving force for the plot, they're so thematically different, I urge anyone who hasn't seen both to just not listen to the hype and take each film for face value, as they're both entertaining in their respective rights. With very good A/V quality, though unfortunately no extras worth mentioning, The Illusionist comes recommended on the strength of the storytelling alone.nd plot-driven scenes.

0307473465|5.0|In 1958, Michael Berg, a fifteen year old German boy had a passionate affair with Hanna Schmitz, a thirty-six year old German woman. The affair that lasted for certain duration had a certain routine. During their meetings, Michael read books to Hanna, showering with her, making love to her, and lying next to her for a while afterwards. A physical relationship between a young boy and a woman twice his age does occur sometimes. Nowadays, it is tolerable if the relationship had been mutually consented.<br />One day, Michael came to visit but he found out that Hanna had moved out; she disappeared. Later on Hanna was arrested and brought to trial for her activities as a guard in Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps, where gassing and burning Jews and some others were everyday occurrences. Michael was present at the court room every single day of the trial and the day when Hanna was sentenced to life. After several appeals for leniency, her life sentence was reduced to eighteen years. Before her scheduled release, Hanna had hanged herself at daybreak.<br /><br />Michael had been disturbed that Hanna had not revealed to him her involvement in atrocities committed during the Holocaust. The author Bernhard Schlink does not reveal which episodes are factual and which are not. By his own admission, he had forgotten many episodes at the time of writing this novel. Ergo, THE READER could not have been classified as a memoir. In either case, I am wondering how sincere Michael was in stating:\\"I was guilty for having loved her, a criminal... I was in a rage at her and what she had done to me (p. 216).\\" Was he really disturbed by the fact that Hanna, like many thousands of Nazi criminals, managed to avoid for so long a court of justice? Hanna was comparatively a minor criminal. Thirty thousand Nazi war criminals got away with murder. Josef Mengele, Adolf Eichmann, Franz Stangl, Martin Bormann, and so many other murderers succeeded to have many years of a pleasant life after the war. They settled in a hospitable Argentina, Peru and other South American countries. Egypt, Syria, Italy, Spain and even the Vatican were accommodating fugitive Nazi war criminals and their collaborators. To me, the following quote from page 169 is most compelling:\\"How could those who had committed Nazi crimes or watched them happen or looked away while they were happening or tolerated the criminals among them after 1945 or even accepted them - how could they have anything to say to their children?\\" I have been asking repeatedly the same question since my liberation from Nazi concentration camp.<br /><br />I am puzzled, how could Hanna function being illiterate! She grew up in a German community in Romania, and then came to Berlin at the age of sixteen. She took a job at the Siemens factory. How could she fill out an Employment Application Form?  Then she ended up in the army at twenty one. Being illiterate, how could she become familiar with the military ordinances and manuals? Also, it is baffling to me that Hanna would rather let herself be unjustly sentenced rather than simply admit that she could neither read nor write. Schlink didn't dive into much detail as he should have. Still, THE READER makes the reader think and reflect. It provokes questions about WWII and its aftermath; about guilt, morality, illiteracy, love and forgiveness. It is very well written and the characters are very well portrayed.<br />I was disheartened to notice that during the trial Hanna expressed no remorse for being a Nazi collaborator in concentration camps. Hanna learned to read and write in prison. It was refreshing to read that that Michael found in Hanna's prison cell books about the Holocaust from Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Tadeusz Borowski, Jean Amery, Hannah Arendt and others'.

B002ZG9788|5.0|Movie - 4.0    While Clash '81 may be Ray Harryhausen's final legacy to a brilliant career and the center of reminiscence for many a child growing up or being born in that decade, I'm going to be honest and say I thought Clash '81 was a good, but not great movie. The reason being because I recently saw Jason and the Argonauts, a film that clearly surpasses Clash '81 in almost every conceivable category be it storytelling, special effects, overall production, and even BD presentation. 18 years after the fact and Clash '81 barely feels like an upgrade over Jason in terms of.. well, anything. The stop animation is barely on par, while the pacing and narrative are even a tad weaker, and yet it's still treasured just for the sake of nostalgia. When I heard a new version of Clash was being directed by Louis Letterier, I was pretty excited. Being familiar with his previous works I knew he came from an action background as a protégé under Luc Besson and that he'd easily find ways to improve the shortcomings of the original to make a more fulfilling fantasy epic. Aside from character and location names, that's about all both movies have in common. And in creating his version from scratch, I feel Letterier has managed to make a very good and entertaining action flick that's not so much a remake, but rather an adaptation for today's audiences. It's a darker, grittier, and more violent film with all sorts of new characters, themes, and special effects that make for better and faster-paced storytelling. Instead of the playful nature of the original where the gods were just bickering over superiority and toying around with their chessboard, or the way Perseus just slowly made his way from point to point with little to no difficulty, I actually felt a deeper sense of drive and purpose from this new version. For starters, the gods actually show emotion: desperation for the love/fear of the people and the power it gives them, jealousy, spite, and vengeance through deception (between Zeus and Hades), and even a little bit of humility (in what Zeus learns about man from Perseus). Meanwhile, the new Perseus actually has some character depth as well: his demi-god blood puts him at odds with the people he's trying to help, while his pride in being raised as a man makes him stubborn in accepting his god-given gifts and heritage, yet he still chooses to fight the oppressive rule of the gods and show them the virtues of being a man. These themes obviously don't get as much exposure as they should, what with a mere 95 minutes of screen time. But having set this foundation of ideals, hopefully the sequels will expand upon them. Much like Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, watch it for the action, but expect hints of story and character.    Video - 4.5    While the photography of Clash '10 does, indeed, have a kind of a processed look, it's actually not that bad. I would personally attribute it to something along the lines of visual effects and/or tweaks made during post-production that, at times, gives certain scenes either a kind of shiny or hazy look (like Mount Olympus and the gods' Saint Seiya armor or the ferry trip across the River Styx). But despite the near-grainless appearance, picture quality looks excellent. Colors from the costuming, set design, beautifully-shot backgrounds, and various creatures still possess a degree of vibrancy from the palace props and soldiers' gear, to the lush greens of the forest and fiery reds of Medusa's lair, to the murky brown scales and tentacles of the Kraken. Black levels are nice and inky, though not too deep, but with great shadow delineation, as seen in the black Pegasus or Stygian Mountain when the witches are introduced. Contrast provides for accurate brightness when need be, though the film itself tries to be a little too dark at times and, thus, loses some detail in people and objects leading to bits and pieces of softness. On the bright side, there don't appear to be any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR, and the picture is completely free of artifacts and debris. CG integration is especially smooth, with highlights being the various appearances of Hades and, of course, the aforementioned Kraken. It should also be noted that 90% of the backgrounds are not even green screen, which amazes me that places like that even exist, so be sure to take those images in as you see them.    Audio - 5.0    Besides the cinematography and special effects, one of my favorite improvements with this new Clash is its sound. Granted the original, like many a Harryhausen feature, was a bit on the low-budget side of production, but it's nice to see and hear the differences in advancement. Dialogue is clear and undistorted through the center and does a great job staying audible amongst the action, while the growls of Zeus and the haunting whispers of Hades give the script a much-appreciated Thespian quality. Directionality has an excellent sense of depth with sounds and action filling their respective speakers when needed, most notably in the battle against Medusa as she rattles and slithers about her temple. Separation is also spot-on with effects and music dispersing equally through the fronts and rears to accompany the situation. While it's a shame Craig Armstrong was dropped as composer (love his work for The Incredible Hulk), Ramin Djawadi's stuff isn't so bad. I actually like his score for Iron Man, and it was nice to hear him try something with more orchestral instrumentation. If you like brass, expect to hear a lot of it. And finally, LFEs aren't as frequent as I expected, but they really pack a punch when they occur. The thundering of Zeus's bolts in the sky, the Scorpinochs battle, and the rising of the Kraken will give your subwoofer a thoroughly progressive workout as each scene unfolds and builds upon the narrative. The overall track may or may not be reference to some, probably depending on your standards for LFEs, but given that there really aren't a whole lot of instancesfor LFEs to shine in the first place, this might be enough for others.    Extras - 4.0    This is my second time ever for a Maximum Movie Mode (the first being Sherlock Holmes). And while it's a tad disappointing Letterier couldn't do the entire thing in person, I actually still liked the commentary, regardless. Instead of the 2-screen, 1-director approach, we get a 2-3-screen presentation where the movie plays bigger and the commentary/interviews play in a smaller screen and takes turns switching priority. In-between these segments, icons for Focus Features will pop up and allow the user to watch a branched-off making-of sequence that lasts about 2-4 minutes per Feature for about 35 minutes total. These Focus Features do not constitute the entire MMM, by the way, and can be viewed separately from the MMM itself if you want. In addition to the Focus Features, the MMM actually takes up a good majority of the film providing lots of cool factoids and opinions from the cast and crew about the filming, design, production, writing, stunt work, and just about everything else. Objectively, all the information probably would've made a fine behind-the-scenes featurette on its own. But to watch it in real-time during the movie is what I think really raises my appreciation the most. The MMM literally explains and expands on every little bit of the movie piece by piece, and I applaud everyone involved for their hard work and perseverance. To top it all off, there's also an 8-minute feature on Sam Worthington that talks about the fact that he did most of his own stunts (a little generic, but I applaud his toughness), deleted scenes that would've completely changed the context of the story, and an alternate ending that wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It's not a lot of extras in terms of quantity, but the quality of it for the MMM alone is worth a look.    Overall - 4.5    Nostalgia will probably be the deal-breaker for most people wanting to see this movie. If you prefer the originalversion for its light-heartedness and more campy demeanor, chances are you won't like this new version because of its inclination toward a darker, grittier atmosphere. If you're like me and one of the few fans of Letterier that can appreciate his forte for action while also realizing this is just the beginning of a trilogy, then maybe you'll like this version enough and forgive a lot of its newer elements in writing and character portrayal. With excellent video, reference audio, and a commentary feature that continues to amaze me, Clash of the Titans (2010) comes highly recommended.
B003JTHESA|4.0|I think this might be Maiden's best album since 7th Son. That's probably saying a lot, but I haven't been completely satisfied with the quality of their music since then. I even stopped listening for a bit after Bruce quit the band. I've been a Maiden fan since the beginning when I was just a kid and heard this awesome music about things that weren't 'pop-ish'. 80s music was not my scene. All their albums had good bits but none shone for me. This album took me back and for that it deserves praise. They're on their game. They're sounding just as fresh as ever. They're giving me classic Maiden sound blended with something approaching newness. My only real beef with the album is that the first song, the title track, doesn't fit thematically with the others on the album. It also has a different sound, one I don't like, so I tend to skip it. The other songs are great. For me, the key to a great Maiden song is when I start singing along with it and getting into the song myself like I do whenever I hear Hallowed Be Thy Name or Run to the Hills. There are no HBTNs or RTTHs on this album, but I do catch myself singing along with Bruce quite often which makes it a good album.   Up the Irons!

B003R0LBVW|5.0|I'm going to keep this short.  I don't normally write reviews, but after I finished \\"Freedom\\" I noticed that the book had only a 3 and a half star rating.  Confused why anybody would give this book less than a perfect rating, I began to read the reviews.  And here's what I think...    This book is amazing.  It's not just a \\"good read\\", or \\"enjoyable\\", it's amazing.  This book has achieved the rare accomplishment of being both a page turner and GOOD. I see that some people feel the need to complain about the very small portions of the book that are political, but let me tell you that these parts are not preachy, they're interesting, and integral to the plot and character development.  Some people people can't handdle it when an author's politics come through in the writing, but I think it's refreshing.  It's always sad to me when I'm reading a book and I can tell the author's trying so hard not to step on anyone's toes.    There's no other way to phrase this: if you don't love this book, then modern novels are not for you.
B00427X6FI|5.0|In Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950) a superb cast, story and cinematography combine to make a film noir classic. This was one of the first selected for preservation by the National Film Registry, and is #16 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 best American movies.<br /><br />It's the story of a young man who falls under the control of an aging former silent-era starlet. When she realizes that Joe Gillis (Holden) is a screenwriter, Norma Desmond (Swanson) asks him to polish the script for her imagined \\"comeback\\" movie. Along the way, he becomes financially dependent on the older lady, who quickly falls in love with him.

B00001U0E1|2.0|This film, about one of the greatest playwrights/poets who ever lived, and my personal favourite, William Shakespeare, could have been a family-friendly film in the style of \\"Howards End,\\" \\"The Remains Of The Day,\\" \\"Ever After,\\" Walt Disney Picture's masterpiece \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" (my all-time favourite movie) and others, but the screenwriters decided, rather stupidly and in the name of \\"Sex sells,\\" to insert sex and nudity in this movie (one of which occurs during an other-wise beautiful montage sequence in the middle of the movie). I'm no prude, but unless a story requires nudity (ie. \\"Schindler's List\\"), there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have someone naked in a movie just to draw a huge crowd into theaters (I guess the nude scene in \\"Titanic\\" was one reason many guys went to see that atrocious unhistorical movie), especially in a period piece. Also, there were a lot of historical errors in the film (I'm unsure exactly how many and the nature of the errors, but I'm certain that William Shakespeare WAS NOT a womanizer). Here's a little-known fact about Shakespeare, and I say little-known because it's not even on the Internet or in today's history-books: William Shakespeare was a CHRISTIAN. The famous line from \\"The Tragicall Historie Of Hamlet, Prince Of Denmarke,\\" Act V, Scene II, \\"There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow\\" is a paraphrase of Jesus saying something about sparrows in The Gospel According To Saint Matthew. I give this film two stars because the actors were top-notch in this movie, especially Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes (though I think Ralph Fiennes would also have made a good Shakespeare, albeit he's not as handsome as Joseph) & Ben Affleck (like Robin Williams, he CAN do drama) and because of the excellent costume/set designs for the film. I've yet to view any of the special features on the DVD. This movie IS NOT for kids. Rated R for sexuality/nudity.<br /><br />Perhps the people who commented did not read my review thoroughly. I said that I don't mind nudity in a movie as long as it is essential to the plot (ie. \\"Schindler's List\\"), and I'm not averse to violence in movies as long as it is-you guessed it-neccessary to propel the story forward. Watch any movie made in the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, and you'll see the graphic violence, language and nudity were not neccessary to the storylines (aside from the fact that the Hays Code prohibited such content).y.

0345457692|3.0|Altered Carbon suffers from ramblitist...it bounces around far more than it has to to tell a tight effective tale.  The entire concept of stacks and resleeving is very interesting, but how it affects his creative universe is a bit flawed.  A world where death really has little consequence, is a world in utter chaos.  I didn't really get that from the novel.  Also, crime really doesn't seem to have any real downside.  Your stack gets stored for XXX years depending on the crime.  I don't think it was mentioned but I'm assuming the criminals are just stored and not living in some virtual environment where they can sense the passage of time (which isn't 1:1 linear in Morgan's virtual reality anyway).  I doubt this would keep most criminals from offending.  And finally the novel covers the topic of persona backups and copying.  This is a concept that seems misrepresented by many science fiction authors.  A copy (or backup) is just that.  Once the original is gone (dead) they can't come back to life as a copy.  That persona copy is an independent persona going forward.    Anyway, I enjoyed it for the most part but it certainly isn't \\"all that.\\"
B003W5C0VM|5.0|As of today this dvd is still not released, but I know it like the back of my hand already thanks to the stellar bootleg copy I have owned for years. I can only assume this new one will be even better quality. What would be nice is if they would offer up some \\"bonus tracks\\" as well. I doubt this will happen however, as Mick Jagger is one who's never cared too much about the past. The Stones filmed 4 concerts for this movie .... two in Ft. Worth and two in Houston in the summer of 1972. (Note that Jagger sports 4 different outfits during the course of the Ladies & Gentlemen film) Songs performed in those 4 shows but not seen in the original film were \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Sweet Black Angel,\\" and Chuck Berry's \\"Don't Lie To Me.\\" It would be great to give the fans what they really want, if you're listening Mick! Otherwise, this film does indeed catch the Stones in their absolute prime. Mick Taylor rules ... Ronnie would if he could. 99% of the shots are extreme close-ups of the band (mostly Jagger) and it would have been nice to have a few more long shots of the stage and the venue itself, but hey ... You Can't Always Get What You Want.

0307463745|5.0|Lots of short chapters each with one key idea.  Count me as someone who was not familiar with 37signals.  I'm a fan now.    Many of the ideas won't apply to your business.  So what was the last business book you read where that wasn't the case?  Some of the chapters may leave you cold.  That's okay too.    That leaves lots of gems. As an intentionally one-person professional firm, here are a few of the gems for me:    Everything is marketing. Every word on your web site, every answered call, even your e-mails are marketing. That is so obvious, yet I had never thought of it that way.  After reading the book, I had the idea to rewrite the signature blocks on my email to increase visibility of one line in the block that is directly marketing. (Aha, that would be application of the last chapter - inspiration is perishable - do something while you are highly motivated to get it done.)    Out teach your competition. As a small outfit, you can teach, educate, and help your clients and potential clients easier than the big guys.  I recently started blogging as a marketing approach and to help my client base. The out-teach-competition chapter gave me ideas for several series of posts beyond the updates and news I had already planned.     Sell your by-products.  The recent blog postings by 37signals is marketing (see above), which is also building an audience (another chapter), and was then turned into this book, which is an illustratin of selling your by-products.  Great idea!  I need to think about how to do that in my firm.     Those gems for me may do nothing for you.  Lots of other ideas that didn't do much for me may be the Aha! inspiration you need.    Be forewarned the authors sometimes use strong language. They do so to good effect, but if that is a concern for you then don't say you were surprised.

B002ZG980U|3.0|\\"Inception\\" has elements of both \\"Memento,\\" which launched the whiz kid Christopher Nolan's film career, and \\"The Prestige,\\" which is Nolan's most complex and subtle, interesting and entertaining, cerebral and provocative achievement to date.      Like \\"Memento,\\" \\"Inception\\" is concerned with how the mind works, how it chooses to gain or lose control over itself.  \\"Memento\\" was about memories, those crucial building blocks of our identity, and \\"Inception\\" is about dreams, which the movie argues is fundamental to how we think and behave.  (Extraction is about looking for locked-away memories, and inception is about implanting a small idea that then grows until like a virus it subsumes everything.)      Like \\"The Prestige,\\" \\"Inception\\" is a complicated maze.  In fact, it is like the dreamworld in which it inhabits, a multi-layered maze, with no start, no exit, and no direction.  Its precious complexity, a Nolan trademark, is ultimately the film's undoing, as while the film clearly entrances it does not hold and capture, and ultimately its idea fails to implant itself:  Nolan's inception has failed.  Both \\"The Machinist\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\" are far more fascinating (and, I believe from a neuroscientist's point of view, accurate) meditations on dreams, dreaming, and dreamers.          Why the film fails is that Nolan does not establish anything concrete in the film, meaning that the entire film feels like a concocted dream.  There is a section which is meant to be \\"reality\\" but the acting is so bad, the editing so fast, the plot so incredible (everything so conveniently falls into place) that it fails to anchor us, and so we just float away.  There are many contradictions (or in Nolan parlance \\"paradoxes) in the film, and that's how Nolan likes it.  I think Nolan was going after the effect of having questioned everything about the film the audience now begins to question everything about their reality.    But, uh, what's the point of that?      There is no doubt thatNolan is one of the most talented and definitely the most cerebral of our directors today.  But there's nothing substantive or particularly intellectual about his films:  they're all just intricate and intriguing puzzles, meant to entertain and challenge the mind -- but there's just no greater meaning under the surface.  So \\"The Inception\\" team dig deeper and deeper into our minds, and all they see is either a vast blanket of snow or a great expansive empty ocean.      The best thing about Nolan as a director is that he knows how to use good actors.  Both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were terrific in \\"The Prestige,\\" and Leonardo DiCaprio shines more under Nolan than under Scorcese.  DiCaprio can be juvenile and irritating under Scorcese (which is probably how Scorcese wants it) but DiCaprio is captivating and sympathetic in this movie.      \\"Inception\\" is a fundamentally flawed concept and plot, but given the mediocrity that is Hollywood nowdadays it's better than most things out there.
0553805371|5.0|Disclaimer: I am reviewing an advance copy that I received for free through the Vine program.<br /><br />What a wonderful book! It is short (less than 200 pages) and very readable, and makes some excellent points (though perhaps there are a few weird out-on-a-limb subjective things, like saying that philosophy is dead... I guess one would have to ask what the authors meant by philosophy, and what they meant by dead).<br /><br />Good stuff, about \\"model-dependent\\" observations and theories... maybe if you sum your Feynmann diagrams in a \\"top-down\\" fashion instead of \\"bottom up\\", you get results which can be interpreted as showing that the \\"future influences the past\\" .... all depends on your model and observations ...<br /><br />Definitely swings for the fences, goes for the big questions, about the big picture. Good discussion of the anthropic principle (both 'weak' and 'strong' especially in light of M theory). Basically we're here and we observe things, so of course this particular universe, this particular set of natural physical laws/constants, this galaxy, solar system, planet etc. are supportive of our kind of life and evolved intelligence (but there are probably lots of others too, which are NOT so amenable to life like us, so we're just like 1 possible outcome, out of 10 to the 500th power possibilities).<br /><br />The book pulls together a summary of recent advances in cosmological theory for the armchair reader (notably M-theory), explaining that with gravity added to quantum mechanics, that just may be a sufficient setting for everything -- Thus we might finally have an explanation for how the entire universe has popped into being, as something from nothing, with no added ingredients required, no prime mover, no intention, etc. (this is the part that has religious nuts all worked up, because it's just eliminated one final hiding place for their \\"god of the gaps\\")<br /><br />To paraphrase from memory without cheating and looking in the book again, basically if I remember correctly, locally quantum-mechanical space time is very stable, with virtual particles not lasting very long, cancelling each other out; but globally, over the entire multiverse, with gravity at relativistic scales in the mix, it becomes unstable, enough that universes, like our own, can indeed just come into existence.tum-mechanical space time is very stable, with virtual particles not lasting very long, cancelling each other out; but globally, over the entire multiverse, with gravity at relativistic scales in the mix, it becomes unstable, enough that universes, like our own, can indeed just come into existence.
0452295548|3.0|I found this book quite annoying. It is relatively short (177 pages), with largish type, but it is still quite repetitive, so there only seemed to be enough actual material here for a magazine article. The description of her actual experience of the stroke was interesting, though it is a little hard to believe that she actually thought all those things as her brain was shutting down. Her description of herself before the stroke is also off-putting--the Singin' Scientist? Performing little jingles about donating your brain to the Harvard Brain Bank when you die? Wow, embarrassingly dorky. And the author's photo in the back of the book, showing her wrapped in her mother's arms? Also embarrassingly dorky.<br /><br />The narrative part of the book is very difficult to fully believe. After having a major brain hemorrhage, she is sent home to recover without having the blood clot removed and the AVM repaired. She has the capacity of an infant, but 4 months later, she somehow manages to give a 20-minute speech at a college, even though she had lost the ability to read? Seriously? And she arranges her hair in a comb-over to hide the 9\\" scar? Oh I'm sure no one noticed a thing!<br /><br />But hey, she's a Ph.D., she works at Harvard, so she must be a brilliant and insightful person, right? If so, she apparently thinks the rest of us are morons, because the book talks down to us, explaining how to pronounce hemorrhage and telling us over and over not to yell at people who have had a stroke.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a mixture of advice to caregivers and stroke survivors and a paean to the wonders of life without  left-brain rationality. Well no, the left brain is valuable too, but the right brain is sooo much better. All peace and joy and compassion and oneness with the universe. And who would have thought it? It turns out that what the right brain really likes is everything New Agers have been selling us--including vanilla scented candles and harmonic CDs. You don't need to have a stroke to try this out. Simple meditation will enable you to access a more right-brained reality.<br /><br />The appendix at the back of the book gives some idea how dorky this book is: Ten Assessment Questions (under the heading Recommendations for Recovery):<br /><br />1. Have you had my eyes and ears checked to make sure you know that I can see and hear?<br />2. Can I discriminate color?<br />...<br />7. Can I access my food? Can my hands open the containers? Do I have the strength and dexterity to feed myself?<br /><br />Oh come on! How could anyone think that those caring for a stroke survivor forgot to find out whether the person is able to access food or not? It's hard to tell whether she is patronizing us, or whether she is really just not making any sense.<br /><br />If you have no knowledge about brain hemispheres and no understanding of what happens in a stroke, and if you have a high tolerance for la-di-da isn't life wonderful stuff, you may like this book.

B003NHRIVQ|5.0|The Last Song is a fabulous movie.  I don't think any Nicholas Sparks movie will ever disappoint, but this one is definitely a keeper.  Ronnie and her younger brother go to stay with their father for the summer.  With their parents newly divorced, Ronnie is anything but thrilled with the idea of spending time with him.  When she meets a young man, her mind starts to change.  When she finds out her dad is dying... it really changes.  She goes from a somewhat snotty teenage girl to a loving daughter who chooses to stay with her father until the end so he doesn't have to die alone.    I have to admit my daughter dragged me to the movie because Miley Cyrus was in it, but she did an excellent job filling the role and giving life to a beautifully written story.  I recommend the movie for all ages, just don't forget to grab yourself a box of tissues when you sit down to watch!    By Kerri J.

B002RWKSII|2.0|This CD is disappointing to me. I love Brian Wilson's past work, but frankly most of the songs on this CD are very traditional old-fashioned sounding arrangements, not much \\"reimagining\\" at all on many of them. And as others have noted, Brian is no longer a great singer, so it would be better if he wrote, arranged, and produced but brought in others to do the singing. And perhaps most disappointing of all, \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" which is an amazing piece usually running over 15 minutes long, but is reduced here to a couple snippets totaling less than 2 minutes. Very disappointing.

B001TK3XPE|5.0|Having worked with the hearing impaired, I found this story of a aging man with high frequency hearing loss a howl.  It so aptly described the pains and pleasures of hearing loss and the tendency to live in one's own world, creating sentences from what must have been said, rather than actually understanding what was said.  This was a small story without major drama, the sort of drama we create contrived from faulty perceptions, imaginings and lapses.  The characters were deftly drawn, the relationships real, the prose was fresh and amusing.

0393325172|5.0|Patrick O'Brian approaches the time period with an unusual degree of mastery of the time period. The Hornblower series along with some of the other more generally known period set naval series smack too much of contrived fiction and at times seem to work too hard to convince their audiences that they are literate in 19th century English life, with an obvious emphasis on the workings of a frigate or ship of the line. Not for a single moment is O'Brian's grasp of the period called into question. His classic portrayels of men from the both the upper and lower decks is as convincing as it is authentic. Preserved Killick, Captain Aubrey's erstwhile and abusive steward is a perfect example of O'Brians effortless capture of a forgotten sort of character. Without having to resort to creative spelling to carry the sense of his dialogue and voice, O'Brian is able to utilize word choice to carry Killick's screeching, whining tone clearly to us, the reader today.     Additionally the conduct of battles and actions, spread across multiple theatres of the Napolenonic Wars all combine to lend a healthy dose of believability to the writing of O'Brian. With an unshakeable grasp of naval terms and concepts, the importance of tactiacal maneuvering before an engagement, and the steadfast reliance on rapid, accurate gunfire, O'Brian succeeds where others have failed. The self doubt and at times self loathing of Hornblower finds no place in the character of Jack Aubrey, the unshakeable captain who is on a lee shore when he is... on shore. At sea he demonstrates time and again his grasp of captaincy and leadership. These characteristics are only aided by his erstwhile companion, confidant, and associate, Stephen Maturin. Surgeon and oftentime secret agent. Their friendship serves to add the needed human touch to a series that could so quickly be sidelined by a succession of overly dramatized naval engagements and intrigue.     Throughout this series, if you develop a love for them as strong as that which i have, You too will find yourself yearning for more. It is such a shame that O'Brian passed away before capping the series, but i feel blessed to have as many books, all of equal quality, that he saw fit to write and leave to us all.

0399536108|5.0|Chris really knows how to throw down so prepare your soul for a lot of boat rockin. By the time I got to chapter 6, the fearful conventional fibers of my being launched a tantrum while Chris explained his higher education experience. I felt like he got away with something huge and I felt cheated...I hated standardized testing and had no higher math skills, why didn't I come up with something like that?! And how does any person take 40 credits at 4 different colleges and not go to the infirmary! I thought this guy was on my level- maybe I was wrong. Of course I knew thinking in \\"levels\\" wasn't going to get me anywhere...    I forced myself to keep reading and tried not to make further comparisons, and yet I felt overwhelmed by all the possible actions to take. Getting into chapter 11 on Legacy and rereading the two most important questions in one's search for meaning helped things come full circle. I needed to answer those two questions before I could move on with the hours worth of further resources listed. My brain was exhausted but I had hope. As Chris puts it, I needed to spend some serious \\"butt-in-seat\\" time.    Over all, It is a masterful book- chocked full of wisdom in multiple fields of interest but it is not for the faint of head. On page 211, Chris mentions not becoming a doctor because he would need to get further training before preforming surgery. I would say that Chris has become a different kind of surgeon... just don't expect him to give you any pain killers when he's done turning your world upside down. Your life is your responsibility. Make it what you dare...

030726999X|4.0|This last book in the Millenium series got off to a decent start, a very slow middle, with a terrific courtroom finish.  Reading through the mid-section can be something of a trial, however, if one is determined, the reader will be rewarded with a satisfying conclusion.  I must state, that I found the first book in series to be the best, that being established, the reader will be enticed to continue to the finish.<br />Like many readers, I found the sections relating to Blomkvist to be somewhat dull, & those dealing with Salander much more interesting.  As many readers & reviewers have noted, you will either love this series, or hate it. True... I can appreciate how both sides of this debate are valid.<br />On a lighter note, it indeed humorous how much coffee is consumed by the characters. In each book, this consumption of the beverage is more pronounced.  I found this rather amusing, & it's impossible to get through a page of the 3rd book without at least one mention of... coffee... Readers! Hoist your  coffee cups to a fine finish, it is indeed a pity that we must bid Lizbeth Salander farewell.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|The newest edition to the Die Hard franchise just doesn't measure up to the first two stellar movies, nor even the less than brilliant Die Hard 3. I tried watching the movie on three separate occasions and just could never get into it. The Mac TV Ad guy Justin Long as a computer hacker was less than original casting and made it feel like one long computer advertisement. Bruce Willis does his best with a forgettable script. For pure entertainment, I recommend the first two Die Hard films over this one.

What's really refreshing is that this book provides a great deal of candid introspection along with those stories.  He even goes so far as to point out his *own* mistakes that precipitated his own exit from a band he helped create - Metallica.<br /><br />Those of you who are hoping for ammunition to defend Metallica in this book will be sorely disappointed.  If anything, people will probably have a renewed level of contempt for Lars Ulrich after reading this it (and in my opinion, rightfully so).<br /><br />Dave provides amazing detail of his upbringing, his life as a child, his discovering music.. and discovering various forms of self-medication to cope with his upbringing and childhood.  These all paint a picture that - while at times bleak -  also explains the drive behind his creative process and the source of inspiration for his lyrics.<br /><br />Now at this point you could say that the book sounds like another \\"don't let this happen to you\\" story.  Well, maybe in some ways - and I'm sure Dave would be glad if it kept at least ONE person from going down the path he did.  I think the difference is that, at the core of all of the insanity around him, there was still a basic sense of decency that was instilled in him.  So as he grew personally and spiritually, and learned to be more introspective, you see the person who continues to deliver in the music business time and time again.<br /><br />Dave talks also very candidly about his conversion to Christianity - very much a 'full circle' story given his beginning as Lutheran-baptized Jehovah's Witness (ugh.. talk about craziness).  He acknowledges that this, along with his wife, Pam, and his family, gave him the strength to find in himself the will to fight and get over addiction once and for all.  Without her I seriously do not think he would have survived as long as he has.  Talk about a woman with amazing strength.<br /><br />A great read that I couldn't put down once I started.<br /><br />And Dave, don't worry about the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.  Seriously.. you WANT to be in a place that they let Lars Ulrich into??!et over addiction once and for all.  Without her I seriously do not think he would have survived as long as he has.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just finished reading this yesterday.  It was slow in the beginning, and I found myself tempted to skip paragraphs.  I'm glad I was patient, though, because I was rewarded at the end.  The second half was non-stop excitement, and at the end, I realized that the first half was a set-up for what happens later.  After reading the less than 5 star reviews, I was afraid that now I was stuck with this whole series in my Kindle.  After reading Mockingjay, I am very happy I have the whole set.

B0011ZNAIC|4.0|The DreamWorks Animation formula, as witnessed in potent franchises like Shrek and Kung-Fu Panda works on the tried and true notion of dazzling children with cute visuals and slapstick action while entertaining the grown-ups with more intelligent humor and pop culture references.  Further tilting the scales in favor of the Bee Movie is that talking, personified animals rarely fail in this arena; add comedic legend Jerry Seinfeld to the fold and all signs point to yes!<br /><br />\\"Bee Movie,\\" directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner definitely leans to the adult side of the humor formula.  Make no mistake, the visuals are bright and crisp, there's no off-color content or situations, but the goofiness interjected in these films to keep the youngsters enthralled has been axed to make way for dryer humor that we older folk will surely enjoy.<br /><br />In fact considering that Jerry Seinfeld played a big part in this film's development, lends his voice and personality to the lead character, and has seen fit to include many of the costars from his hit television series, the type of humor within could best be compared to the logical/ observational type of comedy to expect here.<br /><br />The story follows one Barry B Benson (Seinfeld) and his best friend Adam Flayman (Mathew Broderick) graduate elementary, high school and college all within a matter of hours and find themselves on the cusp of adulthood, where, like all bees, it is time to choose which part of the honey-making process they'll be a part of for the rest of their short lives.<br /><br />Barry, it seems, doesn't jive with the hive way of thinking.  And rather than sign up for a singular job to last a lifetime, a trip outside the hive with the pollen jockeys opens Barry's peepers to a much larger world; namely the world of humans. A chance encounter with a bubbly florist named Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), Barry breaks the cardinal bee rule and speaks aloud to her! Yes that's right folks, all bees can openly communicate with us at any time but usually choose not to.<br />Long story short, Barry accompanies this human woman to the grocery store, discovers humans have stolen honey for bees and are selling it for a profit and decides then and there to put an end to the exploitation of bees by suing the human race.<br /><br />Traditional? Not exactly... But effective in a comedic sort of ridiculousness.  The film succeeds with a nice quick pace and characters that are easy to become concerned about.  Some of the lighter moments include cameos from a whole host of performers from Sting and Ray Liotta over to Larry King.  Chris Rock dazzles as the mosquito Mooseblood and even stars like Kathy Bates, Oprah Winfrey, and John Goodman manage to elevate what began as a clever little concept.<br /><br />In all I definitely enjoyed the Bee Movie and suspect I would have even if I wasn't a bit of a Seinfeld aficionado (why he couldn't write in parts for Jason Alexander and Michael Richards is truly beyond me).  The visuals do little to elevate the genre but they are clean and crisp in that \\"DreamWorks\\" kind of way and though the plot may drudge on a bit too much for the youngsters to endure, the older crowd will definitely not complain should the tikes request this one be put into the DVD player.but usually choose not to.

0439023513|1.0|Movie studios refuse to allow critics to see lousy movies before opening night, figuring that their inevitably negative reviews can only hurt ticket sales. Scholastic refused to send out copies of Mockingjay for review, a decision that correctly predicted the fact that this book is really lousy.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins had a good formula in The Hunger Games, and she repeated it almost exactly in the sequel, Catching Fire. However by the end of that book the districts were in open rebellion and many of the principals had been killed, which would seem to make it difficult for her to repeat the plot a third time in Mockingjay, the final book in the series.<br /><br />Have no fear, fans of The Hunger Games, Collins turned on the xerox machine a second time. The major difference between this book and its prequels is the color of the bookjacket (Spoiler Alert: Blue!). The first half of the book is devoted to Katniss Everdeen biting her lip, tossing and turning over whether to date Peeta or Gale, and trying on fabulous outfits. Her favorite designer was killed in the last book but, joyfully! it turns out he had secretly made a book of final designs for her before he was offed. The people of District 13, though impoverished to the point of never disposing of a piece of paper until both sides are thoroughly filled with text, have no trouble putting together the exotic materials needed for Katniss's couture.<br /><br />The plot of this volume deals largely with warfare, a war in which the districts band together to defeat the Capitol. However, Collins shares essentially none of this with us, instead we follow around Katniss and her film crew until on page 191, almost halfway through the book, somebody says \\"Good news is, the fighting's almost over in all of [the districts] but Two.\\" Virtually the entire war is reduced to a single sentence fragment.<br /><br />We have been told over and over again in the previous books, and again in the first half of this book, that the Capitol relies on the districts for food and other supplies. In this book we discover that they even get their own soldiers from District Two. Once the rebels have won all the districts (p.217), it would seem an easy enough to just starve the Capitol to surrender. That, however, would deprive Collins of her chance to throw Katniss back in an arena.<br /><br />Instead, the rebels decide on a frontal assault. Katniss goes though training, just as in the earlier books, she wears her special costume, as in the earlier books, designed by the same guy, and she is coached by Haymich, just as in the earlier books. In a war of magical lasers, hovercraft, and genetically modified lizard-dogs, she carries a bow & arrow, just as in the earlier books. Her team enters the Capitol, which has been boobytrapped to be just like the arenas of the Hunger Games and Catching Fire. There is even a dialog between her and Peeta repeated verbatim from the first book (p.321). It's all implausible and silly, and surprisingly boring. So many pages of teenaged angst; I am sure Jeanne d'Arc never whined like this.<br /><br />This book may be of interest to thirteen year old girls who find the 'Gale vs. Peeta' question fascinating, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody else.food and other supplies.

B000O179HW|1.0|The DVD was playing well until it had gotten to a certain scene and then it errored (first it starts skipping, then no sound, and then the error msg: Cannot play the disc.  Error code: 408bc504, then goes back to the beginning of the DVD).  I went back to try to play the scene again and it errored again and a third time, same place.  I sent this problem to foggypaws, but this was their response:  \\"My Toshiba player locks up sometimes as well. All DVD players 'wear out' overtime due to the moving lens moving back and forth for hundreds of hours. But it is possible that a firmware upgrade might help.

B0037QGS0A|3.0|The reason I rented this movie was because I admire Liam Neeson's and Julianne Moore's acting skills, and loved Amanda Seyfried's performance in Big Love and Mamma Mia! The plot of the story is predictable enough - a middle-aged couple played by Moore and Neeson are experiencing some strains in their marriage and their teenage son is totally self-absorbed. Then Moore mets Chloe (Seyfried) in the ladies' room whilst at dinner with her husband. The viewer senses an immediate connection and when Moore suspects her husband of cheating on her, she asks Chloe to seduce him to see his reaction. Well, Chloe plays along with this charade, and gives a blow-by-blow of her sexual encounters with Neeson's character, much to Moore's initial mortification and eventual turn-on (yes, apparently she gets off on hearing about their sexual exploits).<br /><br />The story then takes a dark turn (well, darker) when Chloe begins to get obsessed with Moore's character, an obsession which is reciprocated to a certain extent. There's some sexual encounters between both women which initially struck me as weird but then slowly began to make sense. Chloe is a complex character, in fact I think her character was the most complex of the three. There is definitely a hint of an abandonment complex, a sense of emptiness within Chloe which she feels can only be assuaged with Moore. The clue here is the hair pin which Chloe keeps and later presents to Moore as a gift. In the deleted scenes, there's more background information provided which enables the viewer to understand the motivations of the characters which I wish had been portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful as can be expected from two experienced actors and a talented up-and-coming actor. I just wish the storyline had been more credibly dealt with. Little things annoyed me too - the portrayal of Moore and Neeson's son as an accomplished pianist and also a hockey player? Not many pianists I know would risk their precious hands playing a potentially risky sport. That aside, there was also some awkwardness in the performance of the teen son. This could have been a complex, erotic thriller but it fell short to me.tentially risky sport. That aside, there was also some awkwardness in the performance of the teen son.

B0019NB9A2|5.0|There is a discussion of the Blu-ray's quality following the required gush.<br /><br />If one had to list, oh, the 10 most-influential motion pictures, \\"Forbidden Planet\\" would be right up there with \\"Birth of a Nation\\", \\"Citizen Kane\\", and \\"Psycho\\". Its influence on popular science-fiction entertainment cannot be overestimated.<br /><br />The seeds of \\"Star Trek\\" are planted here, particularly the use of the ship's captain, executive officer, and surgeon as the principal players. So too is the conceit that the purpose of outer-space travel is to explore inner space -- the human condition. The desire to dress female space travelers in skimpy costumes isn't ignored, either.<br /><br />What makes \\"Forbidden Planet\\" such a standout is not that it was the first color science-fiction film (it wasn't), nor that it was the first \\"good\\" science-fiction film (\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" and \\"Things to Come\\" come to mind), but rather the lavishness of the production and the unbridled imagination behind it. \\"Forbidden Planet\\" catches the viewer right from the start, with a nifty flying saucer and the greatest robot in movie history, in just the first 15 minutes. The visual effects (particularly of the ship passing behind Altair IV to produce an eclipse, and the surface of Altair IV) were state-of-the-art then, and more-convincing-than-not 54 years later.<br /><br />Also novel is the fact that the huge (for its time) $4M+ budget is in service of what is an intellectual story about whether man is basically good or evil, and whether we have the right to \\"play God\\". (\\"Forbidden Planet\\" owes a great deal to written science-fiction, and little to comic strips or previous films.) It's all dressed up with an ironic/sarcastic robot, and undressed-down with Anne Francis in mini-skirts that leave little to the imagination -- but \\"FP\\" is not the special-effects extravaganza we expect modern science-fiction films to be.<br /><br />This might explain why it's taken so long for \\"Forbidden Planet\\" to appear on Blu-ray, especially as there was an earlier HD-DVD edition. It appears Warners doesn't think there's much of a market for it. The local Fry's received only /one/ copy, which had not been sold when I walked in around 12:30PM on 9/7. One of the sous-managers told me that many Fry's hadn't received /any/ copies.<br /><br />\\"Modern\\" (hah!) audiences might also have problems with \\"Forbidden Planet\\"'s less-than-stellar acting (Walter Pidgeon is the only A-list actor). The best performance comes, not surprisingly, from Marvin Miller. His Robby deftly alternates among ironic/sarcastic {\\"It promotes rust.\\"), hurt (\\"Again?\\"), naive (\\"Stuff, sir?\\"), threatening (\\"Will you get in?\\"), and helpful (\\"May I be of service?\\").<br /><br />The script has more than its share of groaners. Though Cyril Hume (an American, not an Englishman), was a decent writer, he clearly failed to read the lines out loud as he wrote them, resulting in some unpleasantly clumsy dialog. (Walter Pidgeon wasn't a particularly good actor, but you can see him trying to improve some of the poorer lines.)<br /><br />Fred McLeod Wilcox's direction has the depth of tissue paper and the subtlety of a steam roller, though its general briskness helps a film that's more talk than action. Leslie Nielsen's delivery of the final line, in which he not only butchers the line, but practically swallows it, is wholly Wilcox's fault. Such poor delivery is (or was) common in American films, but this example is one of the very worst (\\"I see no enemy\\" in \\"Ben-Hur\\" being the other).<br /><br />\\"Forbidden Planet\\" has its problems, but any modern viewer who actually /enjoys/ the garbage turned out by modern film makers has no right to criticize. \\"Forbidden Planet\\" might not be \\"Amadeus\\" -- but it's /definitely/ not \\"There's Something About Mary\\".<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray edition... \\"Forbidden Planet\\" was shot on Eastmancolor, which, at that time, could not compete with Technicolor for sharpness or grain. (Technicolor had been abandoned at that point, anyhow.) Grain is sometimes visible, and the image is not as super-sharp as one might like. The transfer is from a composite negative, presumably the one used for the 50th-anniversary edition. As with that version, scenes with animation or static mattes show a significant drop in sharpness and color accuracy, and an increase in contrast. This is unavoidable, the price one pays for the rest of the film looking so good. I'd give it a B to B+ for HD image quality.<br /><br />There used to be a \\"real\\" stereo soundtrack for \\"Forbidden Planet\\", but the sound on this version appears to be panned mono. \\"Extras\\" include everything (I think) that came with the deluxe 50th-anniversary version (other than the metal box, lobby cards, and Robby figurine). These include the \\"sequel\\", \\"The Invisible Boy\\", an episode of the \\"The Thin Man\\" (which has a political twist surprising for its era), and several good \\"making of\\" featurettes.

0439023513|5.0|Fans of The Hunger Games will love the third and final installment, I know I did.  Continuation of earlier themes made it flow and read easily.  Like the first two books, Katniss is tortured by memories as well as current circumstances and torn between two loves.  The end provides resolution to this, but doesn't turn it into a \\"happily ever after\\", which was appropriate.  While I normally enjoy a fairytale ending, it wouldn't have felt right.  Let's say it ends with Katniss happier than she has been most of her life, which in itself feels like a miracle.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I've got the FPS Freek thumbstick extensions fitted onto the Pro Elite (just like my 360 controller), and if you blindfolded me I really wouldn't be able to tell the difference (except for the textured grip and different PS3 d-pad on the Pro Elite). It may be a little lighter feeling than the 360 controller (but it doesn't have 2 AA batteries stuffed inside of it either, so this is probably the reason). Overall, it seems like a good deal for $35. The response of the thumbsticks feels just right--may be a little loose-feeling for some players; the sticks don't seem to provide as much resistance to pressure as the 360 controller thumbsticks [which I find a bit too tight], but it really doesn't seem to make too much of a difference (they simply don't require as much heave to move). Holding the Pro Elite side-by-side with the 360 controller, the size is big, comparable in thickness and width (I was expecting it to be smaller, but I'm glad it's not). The triggers are perhaps not as elongated as the 360, but they absolutely FEEL more like triggers than the original Dualshock, no question. The shoulder buttons are fine. It certainly fills the gap for those of us who own (and love) both consoles and know how seriously better the 360 controller is over the Dualshock. No flaming, just truth-saying.    Plugged in the dongle, didn't touch a thing, and the PS3 recognized the controller right away. My made-for-little-people-hands Dualshock is now sitting on the shelf. Goodbye. The Pro Elite turns the PS3 off no problem (but not on--you have to turn the console on manually first); it has sixaxis control; lighted buttons (who cares, but...). I'm sure eventually someone (maybe even Power A) will improve on third-party controllers for the PS3, but at this moment in time, this seems to be a perfectly fine solution--and a loooong time coming for those of us who care about such matters (and those of us who somehow sidestepped the Dreamgear Shadow 6 controller debacle). Now if only someone would make one with programmable buttons, but I guess I'm asking for too much.    #####################    EDIT #1: OK, so after a bit more intense play, the sticks do have a pretty big deadzone overall, I hate to say. I've got no other technical problems with the controller like others have. I don't spend time doing precision sniping online, just single campaign shooters against usually dumb AI, so I still prefer the feel of a 360 controller for the PS3, even if the deadzone means there's a learning curve / handicap to deal with. The textured grip is not smooth like the 360 of course, but it's not like picking up a box of needles, like some noisemakers seem to say here. Sounds to me like some of these players' hands are a bit on the...soft(?) side. But overall, yeah the deadzone business is going to take some getting used to, but I'll manage. It's worth it to avoid the cramped hand sensation of the too-tiny Dualshock.    ####################    EDIT #2: Finally had some FPS time with the controller (maybe about 10 hours) and wanted to add a quick update regarding the deadzone issue and regarding what some people call the \\"porcupine\\" textured grip. 1) For run-n-gun type scenarios (I've been revisiting games like Resistance 1 and 2, as well as Haze [playing coop campaign with a friend over LAN, which I never did first time around, and it is actually pretty fun]), the controller does seem to function fine. (Actually my coop partner and I both bought the controller, and they both work simultaneously in the same room--no frequency mixup/crossover problems or anything like that. However, his thumbsticks have had some sticking problems when pushed to the far left or right, but I've had no such problems--so the quality of the build seems to be a little hit and miss.) To clarify, I am NOT talking about super-precision sniping or anything like that though--strictly in fast-strafing scenarios (as well as down-the-iron-sights shooting), you end up compensating for the deadzone pretty quickly. Honestly, after 10 hours I am not noticing the deadzone in game at all; it feels pretty much like a 360 controller. (Reminder: I am using the FPS Freek thumbstick extenders on the Pro Elite controller, which I think helps with the deadzone issue a bit.) But again, this is not hair-trigger precision sniping stuff--but strictly run-n-gun. 2) Those who are complaining about their hands being permanently bruised by the textured grip on this controller are whining babies, or they have some rare brittle-skin disease or they are holding their controller like a freaking vice. In other words, the textured grip is neither here nor there--it does not ruin the controller, but it doesn't really add anything to it either. It just is what it is. It's not smooth like the 360 controller, and this is probably why these \\"overly sensitive\\" players are whining. I'll probably continue using the controller, but I've also recently invested in a wired 360 controller and the XCM Cross Battle Adapter 2.0, which allows use of an actual wired (not wireless) 360 controller on the PS3 with the added function of being able to reassign any button and the triggers/bumpers (and it also supports sixaxis motion control through the funky use of another switch on the adapter and assigning one of your thumbsticks to do the sixaxis stuff--not a permamnent solution, but at least it's there). It's a pricey investment (the XCM adapter costs about $75 itself, ugh) and requires a wired controller. I know nothing about deadzone/lag issue with this setup either (I understand there may be some lag problems), so I'll check in again for a little comparison after some playtime. But I hated the button layout on games like Killzone 2 (though I did finish that game as-is), and I wanted to see how being able to reassign buttons would improve my game. OK, now I'm rambling.    ##################    EDIT #3: I promised I would come back and discuss the XCM Cross Battle Adapter 2.0 and a WIRED 360 controller on the PS3. I just reviewed the XCM product here on Amazon (look it up), but here's the gist (it's all good news): After some limited use, if you can stand using a wired 360 controller, this setup FAR EXCEEDS any of the third-party wireless PS3 controllers I've attempted to use. There is no deadzone, and there is no lag. (If there is any lag, it is so microscopic I am unable to detect it. Some overly sensitive-types might believe they can detect a lag, but I think these folks might be imaging things). The button remapping is super simple. And the XCM DOES actually support six-axis motion control through the use of a switch (since, of course, the 360 controller has no motion control). It might not be a great solution, but at least it's there. Here's how the six-axis works: Hitting a switch on the adapter, you can assign the six-axis function to either the left or right thumbstick. BUT of course, whichever stick you use will lose its normal function (until you hit the adapter's sixaxis switch to off again). So, this is only a temporary solution--in other words, if you play a game that at times requires sixaxis (like in Killzone 2 when you have to turn a valve by tilting the whole controller left to right), you need to have the adapter near you, hit the switch, use the thumbstick by moving it left to right, then hit the adapter switch again to use your thumbstick normally. Not that big a deal, unless you are playing a game requiring a lot of sixaxis stuff. In a case like this, I could see this becoming an irritation if you had to do it a lot. The adapter also has a rapid fire function which I have not tried and probably will not use.     Honestly it was a chunk of change---all told, $75 for the adapter and another $25 or so for a wired controller---and this amount might be why it seems many people shy away from this setup. I can't blame them. But I have to say, having this VERY responsive 360 controller (that I can totally customize, yay, and again as far as I cantell, there is no discernable lag and absolutely no deadzone at all--after all, it's simply a wired 360 controller, so there would be no actual deadzone anyway) plugged into my PS3 makes me a happy gamer. Totally recommended if you've got the cashola.     (Oh, and since I'm so anal retentive about my gaming, I actually opened an old PS2 controller I had, removed/shaved down the triangle/circle/square/x buttons (same size as the Dualshock 3 buttons), cracked open the wired 360 controller and removed the A/B/X/Y buttons, and put the PS3 action buttons into the 360 controller, so the shapes match with on-screen context-sensitive button presses. Doing this is possible and takes an Xacto knife, some epoxy, and a little time. Totally doable. So, the wired 360 controller I am using with the XCM adapter actually has the PS3 action buttons in it. Heaven.) Think I'm going to sell my Pro Elite now. There's really no need to keep it...yay!
B00164KYV4|5.0|It's hard to make a movie as good as the book, especially \\"He's Just Not That into You\\" by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. However; director Ken Kwapis did a great job creating a more personalized and emotional stories!<br /><br />We impetuous humans view relationships as an exception to all the common sense rules especially when we fall in love. The funny part is that we do it every time thinking that this time is somehow completely different. We continue to over analyze and complicate the obvious: If somebody is into us, they will simply show it! Clearly it is less science than we all might imagine and very given to our acquired delusions.<br /><br />Something must be said about clever movies that use jokes and laughter to present complex and confusing subjects like love, relationships, and humans' infinite stupidity! This is a great and smart movie that is worth every minute!
0451219597|1.0|I have to say this is probably one of the worst books I have read in recent years. I described it when asked by a friend as an Enid Blyton book for grown ups, it just needed a few \\"jolly good wheezes\\" in it to round off the general effect. The plot was totally implausible from beginning to end, and by half way through I did not care what happened to any of the characters, nor quite frankly what would happen at the end of the book.    The torture and interrogation of captured and or arrested resistance or allied forces was beyond credulity, that an important member of the resistance would divulge all she knew simply to save the embarrassment of wetting herself because she was not allowed to the toilet, was laughable, as were some of the other inventive tortures that can only be described as deviant.    That \\"The Jackdaws\\" themselves were recruited in less than 24 Hours for such an important mission from a bunch of transvestites and misfits was also comical. Do yourselves a favour and leave this book on the shelves of your local bookstore, or if you really must read it see if you can get my copy from where I left it on a Hong Kong Ferry.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I won't repeat what's already been written about this awesome series. Suffice to say that it's the best TV for years and has got quite a following on this side of The Pond. One question though, why do the majority of villains in US TV have to have such naff and effeminate English accents??
0553805371|4.0|As other reviewers said, this book is a quick read of modern physics presented by geniuses. Their approach to explaining the historical progression of theories that lead to M Theory is quite entertaining. They thankfully leave out the math and stick to logic, leaving the beauty of the theories to shine through. Taken as a nice summary quantum physics primer the book is worth the read.    Unfortunately the authors make a fundamental mistake in declaring that free will is nothing more than the inability of scientists to do the calculations for the interactions of the thousand trillion trillion particles that make up a person. Apparently the authors' particles made them write this book without any choice in the matter. They want to reduce consciousness to mere biology. Too bad they rely on model-dependent realism - apparently subatomic interactions force us to create models as well. Their theory devolves into particle determinism, not realism. The Game of Life proves it! Yeah, right.    Philosophy as a profession is dead, but philosophy as a branch of knowledge is not. M Theory may explain the underlying physics of the universe but it has no ability to explain consciousness. The authors correctly arrive at atheism as truth, yet miss completely on free will and consciousness.
0743298039|5.0|Excellent book!  It took me a while to get through this book as life got in the way of my reading :)  However, this story was unique and beautiful.<br /><br />This is the story of a character's mysterious biography.  There are two narrators; the biographer and the biographee :)  The biographee is a writer herself and has never let anyone know the truth of her life's story.<br /><br />I'm sure others have already given a synopsis of the story, so I'll spare you the repetition.  This is a story that keeps the reader guessing at what will happen next.  Characters weave in and out of the story in such a way that you never know what is going to happen next.  Setterfield has a beautiful way of writing that I can't quite describe what I loved about it.  She gives details, but not so many that you get lost in the details and forget the story.  The characters are wonderfully written and you can get lost in them and their stories.<br /><br />I was drawn to this book because of the cover art (I know, I know, but I am a lover of books and can't help myself), the idea of a mysterious biography, the promise of ghosts (which the story isn't nearly as *ghostly* as one would think from the back cover) and reviews by others.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good fictional story, especially historical fiction.

B001ANUXUI|5.0|This is a review of the CD sound quality only. We already know how great of an album Who's Next is!    So I have at least three versions of this CD, including the rare MCA Ultimate MasterDisc gold edition. To my amazing surprise, this original 1984 issue is the best sounding of the lot! The new \\"remastered\\" deluxe edition is bloated and overly manipulated-- too loud which means it has been compressed and most likely peak limited during the mastering process.  The gold disc edition is okay but a bit disjointed. \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" also doesn't sound right on the gold disc. There seems to be digital noise or distortion in the middle register which affects the guitars and vocals during louder passages in this song. It's almost like the sound engineer feel asleep towards the end of the project. A true shame since the rest of the release isn't too bad.    Now, this 1984 edition is sonically fantastic! It has a lot of dynamics and breath. There's  an inherent warmth in the sound that you can only find on vinyl. No distracting distortion or \\"tingy\\" digital treble. The bass is well rounded and instruments are sharp and defined. Why does this version sound so much better than later iterations? Here's a tidbit I only found out after several years of owning this CD: this version was remastered by none other than legendary mastering guru Steve Hoffman. His DNA is all over this. If you are a big fan of the sound he was able to get from the gold discs he remastered for DCC and Audio Fidelity, you must grab this copy! Amazon.com may not list the serial number but just to make sure you have the right copy, the Steve Hoffman remastered edition's serial number is MCAD-37217.
B00006AW2G|5.0|If this album were a living entity, it could only be a deranged unnatural abomination - a Frankenstein - such are it's deep contradictions. How so? Well, just consider the irreconcilable contrast between the two forms by which all the songs here can be divided. On the one hand we have the simple, rootsy, lo-fi charm of the countrified tunes \\"Love In Vain\\", \\"Country Honk\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\", and \\"You Got The Silver.\\" These are modest nods to the musical forms that first moved the pubescent Brits. And then, on the other hand - a very scarred and bloody hand - we have the full throttle, balls-to-the-walls, death taunting, bravado of \\"Gimme Shelter\\", \\"Live With Me\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\", and \\"Monkey Man\\" - searing, slick, highly produced, modern marvels of mayhem.<br /><br />Sure, other bands, even other Stones albums, have their complementary moods, but on this disc the Bad Boys really pushed the the two sides as far apart as anyone ever had. Then, to boot, they did themselves one better. Of course, I'm referring to the sublime gritty splendor that is the majestic closer to this unholy union of the sacred and the profane, the soaring classic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" On this number they manage to not only gorgeously unite the two opposing aspects of this album but also dare to sum up the history of rock music, as it was at that moment, in a gloriously grand orchestration of all of their most profound influences. The resulting creation, a miraculously thrilling gospel epic, is at once as emphatically, absurdly overblown and melodramatic as any self possessed egomaniac could dare, while simultaneously being as humble and sincere as a farm hand's lament.<br /><br />The value of this atrocious unity, this mad marriage, is how spectacularly it reflects the American Experience. With their 3,000 miles of perspective, the Stones were uniquely positioned to construct a remarkable mirror to reflect the impossible, the irreconcilable, the tragic divisions that marked the US culture. It's a diagnosis of our collective mental fracture set to guitar and piano and tears. No one has since come anywhere near the perfection of this performance, this monstrously divided, monumentally sick masterpiece.s a diagnosis of our collective mental fracture set to guitar and piano and tears.

159448385X|4.0|Nightmarish look into the lives of two Afghan women and the results of a tyrannical, male dominated society.  Hosseini is an excellent story teller and this is a book you can't put down, but the feeling is not one of enjoyment but of horror as you look at the violence done by one human to another.  I had the same reaction to this book that I had to Harold Marcuse's Legacies of Dachau.  This novel will not improve relations between Muslims and the west as western freedoms will not allow women to be treated as they are in this tale of absolute control.

0765326353|5.0|I must first admit that I am a fan of Brandon Sanderson's previous works and began reading his newest novel with some high expectations.  These expectations were well met.  The Way of Kings sets the scene for a coming battle of good versus evil that, while commonplace in the fantasy genre, is made unique through rich world building and in depth character development.  The world of the novel is expertly constructed and the details (cultural, religious, and environmental) attest to Sanderson's years spent developing the world.  Of particular note is the environmental landscape and geography of the world.  Massive storms rip through the landscape originating from a point deep in an unknown ocean in the East.  Yet they have natural characteristics in that the storms diminish over distance and are even blocked by a mountain range far in the west of the world's main continent.  The animals and plants to the far east (near the storm's origins) then have evolved to adapt to the pressures created by them (Sanderson does not use the term but it is clearly the case).  Instead of large mammals being commonplace, arthropods have become dominant and are present in their niches (like that of a dog, or oxen) because their shells provide protection during the storms.  The plants have similarly adapted over time to be able to withstand the storms.  In the far west these pressures do not exist, and grasses do not hide in the ground and plants that would flourish without the storms (an example from the book is strawberries) are still present there.   All of this world building alone almost makes the novel worth buying.  Yet Sanderson compliments it with realistic and complex characters that are put through extraordinary circumstances which change them as the story develops.  The philosophy presented through the characters is also quite detailed and the present of a smart and competent atheist (Gasp) was something that was very unique.  I must end this review with a positive nod to themysteries that are still present at the end of this first chapter of The Stormlight Archive.  These are numerous and deep enough that I will be reading the book again just to pry out any clues I might have missed while waiting for the next book in the series.

0374158460|5.0|Warning: some readers may find some scenes pornographic. In other words, Jonathan Franzen doesn't necessarily take his readers to the edge, he actually tosses us over. And that is wonderful! This has to be one of the most amazingly conceived and written novels of the early 21st century, one that out Updikes Updike, that challenges Faulkner's place in the literary world as the master of the sentence that seems never to end. See page 191 which will require you to move to 192. But take in a big dosage of oxygen. It is one hell of a delicious sentence, one of thousands in this thick satire.<br /> Some of you may have already met the Berglunds--and let me state this: the Berglunds are the new Rabbit--in a Franzen \\"New Yorker\\" story that appears at the beginning of this novel. Walter and Patty. Lovely people living in lovely Minnesota. And with two lovely children: Jessica and Joey. Patty, of course, is the perfect mom who stays home and bakes the best-ever cookies while Walter earns enough money to keep their lovely lives running smoothly along with the Volvo. All this, of course, back a few decades. And next door is Carol--one of those unwed mothers--and Connie who spends most of her out-of-school time being mothered by Patty. Carol's house needs a lot of attention as does Carol. And soon she will be getting it from her newest boyfriend, Blake, who... Well, enough of that except for this. Patty was a college jock from a White Plains, New York, politically liberal family. And Patty has never fit in. So that is one reason moving to good old Minnesota has such appeal, more appeal actually than her not-so-much-attracted-to Walter who, by the way, has a buddy, Richard. Richard the cynic plays a very large role in this novel and is a totally wonderful contrast to Walter. Richard, by the way, rises to international stardom with his many bands and the songs he writes. Walter and Richard share similar views about the state of the planet: progressive ones. At least until... But, enough...

B002ZG993Q|2.0|I expected a lot more from this movie and I was disappointed.  The camera work and acting were superb, and the scenery beautiful, but the pace was very slow.  The main problem was that the story was not plausible or compelling - very little actually happened, and what eventually transpired in the end made no sense.  Not even the development and interactions of those stylish and mysterious characters could make up for the pedestrian and meaningless plot.  (BTW, I dare you to try shipping an M-14 in a film tube to a place like that in Italy or set up a gunsmithing shop with loading dies, mercury, etc. by making one trip to an auto repair garage.)  Jack was a very lonely and troubled man, and George Clooney seemed to be very comfortable in that role.  The  makers of this film must have thought that the audience is supposed to develop an emotional connection with someone like Jack, a top-notch professional \\"doing his job\\", because of the following:  1. The assasination business is way cool;  2. Jack encountered new circumstances that resulted in his eventual transformation;  3. Jack was played by none other than George Clooney.

The characters are likable, the magic is complex and different, the action is great, and I love the visual descriptions.  It is very well written.  And I am not a huge fantasy fan, I mostly read the big bestsellers.  I always try and guess what's going to happen in the books I read, and this one is full of surprises.  I absolutely loved it!

1563890119|5.0|\\"The Sandman\\" was perhaps the single most-acclaimed series of the 90s. Originally conceived as a vehicle for reviving an old superhero, it became a deciding factor in the creation of DC's \\"Vertigo\\" imprint, ran for seven years and 75 issues, made the New York Times Bestseller list, had numerous spin-offs, including \\"Lucifer,\\" which ran for 75 issues, and became a grand epic story and a tribute to human creativity. It even inspired the revival of said old superhero, in the form of \\"Sandman Mystery Theatre.\\"    \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is not this book. It is a very, very good book, but it is not what solidified The Sandman as one of the greatest comics ever written. The early comics in Neil Gaiman's magnum opus do not have the same extended narrative focus as the later issues, and it is more of a horror comic than it is a poetic tribute to the human imagination. Nevertheless, \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is highly imaginative, scary, and at times poignant.    \\"Sleep of the Just,\\" issue 1, is a bit confusing, giving us a somewhat bizarre story that, in a roundabout way, introduces us to Dream of the Endless and the main conflict of the story - he is imprisoned by a group of occult magicians who seek to capture death, and they steal his tools. It also serves to set up events in future books.    Issue 2, \\"Imperfect Hosts,\\" has Dream returning to his realm, which has fallen into a state of disrepair. The last page, I feel, is one of the books highlights.    \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" brings us a crossover with John Constantine, of \\"Swamp Thing\\" and \\"Hellblazer\\" fame (two other famous Vertigo series). Having never read a John Constantine story, I feel his character was somewhat underutilized here.    \\"A Hope in Hell\\" is far more interesting than the previous issue, and introduces us to Lucifer, setting up the aforementioned spin-off comic. It contains one of the books other highlights, being a battle of wits between Dream and the demon who has his helmet. This book also introduces us to another plot element that is further explored in \\"The Doll's House\\" and \\"Season of Mists.\\"    \\"Passengers\\" is a more bizarre case. It sets up the primary antagonist of the next few issues, Dr. Destiny, an old and somewhat silly supervillain of the DCU. He is no longer silly. This issue is odd because of how much it stakes in the DC Universe. It features appearances from not only Dr. Destiny, but also Jonathan Crane (the \\"Scarecrow\\" of Batman fame), Scott Free (\\"Mister Miracle\\"), and the Martian Manhunter. Fans of DC will no doubt appreciate the references.    It's the last three issues where I feel this book really hits its stride - \\"24 Hours,\\" which is a work of pure horror, is one of the most disturbing things in this book's entire run, and one of the few works that Neil Gaiman said genuinely horrified him.     The next, \\"Sound and Fury,\\" gives us the climactic final showdown between Dr. Destiny and Dream. It wraps up the story arc and gives a satisfying conclusion. In earlier editions of the volume, this ended the book, but there has since been a change for the better.    The final issue included in this collection is quite a change of pace - \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" introduces us to Death of the Endless, who is perhaps the most popular character in the entire series (she has three spin-offs books, one of which is oddly in the style of a Manga). Probably ties with Discworld for having the most popular version of the grim reaper to appear in fiction, likely due to the fact that Sandman's Death is not particularly grim. This story initially appeared in volume 2, \\"The Doll's House,\\" but it serves better here, as \\"The Doll's House\\" is already a better book than \\"Preludes and Nocturnes,\\" it has more relevance to the first book, and its omission from \\"The Doll's House\\" keeps the book from opening with two comics that have nothing to do with its main arc. Despite the subject, this is no doubt the lightest story in the book, which starts to set up the series as more of a dark fantasy than a horror, as earlier issues indicate. It's certainly a good note to end the collection on.    While \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is not what The Sandman would eventually become, it has it's moments of inspiration, even in the earlier issues that don't quite mesh with each other, sometimes working better as individual issues than as a collected storyline (understandable, as these were the first issues).    I might not recommend this if you are only going to put a small number of comics in your library. If you want what solidified this series as a masterpiece, I'd recommend checking one of the later volumes. However, if you want to read the entire series, the very beginning is a very good place to start, and faulting the first volume for not living up to the others is a very small criticism.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I have been reluctant to comment on Inception; there seemed little I  could add to the already extensive commentary. My initial sense was  that Inception, while it was a welcome relief to standard summer fare,  possessed enough flaws and precedents to render its claims to greatness  suspect. I gave it 8 stars over my first viewing and let it go at that.     Now, having watched Inception twice since then and having read the  screenplay (see the excellent, Inception: The Screenplay), I have  changed my mind. Inception is worthy of the praise given it. Without  reservation I now give it a 10. This is the first occasion in which I  have changed my verdict on a film following my initial viewing. Why?  Because Inception is easily the best film of the decade in terms of  sheer intelligence, the best film I would argue since The Truman Show.  Moreover, its plot of obsessive love, fear of falling, and frightening  dreams, makes it worthy of comparison to Vertigo. As good as Vertigo?  The fact that Inception can be mentioned without blanching in the same  sentence with Hitchcock's masterpiece tells you something.     I came to love the movie but I was desperate to say something new. I  wanted to comment on the richness of the world of Inception, and give   the viewer a bit more of an understanding of what underlies it.     In the near future, a drug has been discovered that enables people to  share a common dream. Viewed by many as a fascinating opportunity for  creativity, one danger is that a dreamer's mind can be invaded by an  intruder and unless the victim has been trained to resist these  \\"extractor(s),\\" he can be tricked into revealing his innermost secrets  (visualized as being within a symbolic dream \\"safe\\"). The battle  between a trained mark and one or more skilled extractors can be  harrowing.     This technology can be described as a form of controlled lucid  dreaming. Until this discovery, all experience had been that lucid  dreams cannot be controlled; anythingcould happen. Since most people  have had them, you know what I mean. But using this drug and its  delivery system (termed PASIV in the screenplay book), lucid dreams can  be controlled. These shared lucid dreams, however, are still subject to  external conditions and the dreamer's own internal state.     Note: the idea of entering into people minds while they are dreaming is  not new. See the movie \\"Dreamscape (1984),\\" which has dream specialists  invading the mark, as protectors or attackers. But there are some  remarkable new angles in Inception's approach.     First, the dreams can be recursive. There can be dreams within dreams  within dreams, though at each additional level the dream state becomes  increasingly unstable, requiring the addition of powerful sedatives to  maintain control.     Second, the recursive levels cannot be extended indefinitely. They  terminate in a state called \\"Limbo,\\" i.e. \\"unconstructed dreamspace.\\"  Limbo may be infinite in expanse. Little is known of it, though  according to the movie's math, time moves roughly 8000 times faster in  Limbo relative to reality.     Third, the minds of the participants, particularly if there is an  emotional involvement between them, can find their dream \\"waves\\" have  become blended or entangled.    There are profound metaphysical dangers in this, ontological and  psychological. Foremost is the loss of one's sense of what is real,  over time being increasingly unable to distinguish between the dream  state and reality. Then there is the loss of one's sense of self. Where  the dreamers are emotionally involved, e.g. in love, their minds can  begin to merge to such an extent that it is a difficult for them to  determine where \\"I\\" begins and the other takes over, who is dreaming  what in other words. There are mechanisms, \\"totems\\" for keeping track  of where one is in these dream spaces, but the problem is unsolved.    Into this world strides Dom Cobb, one of the best \\"extractors,\\" a  disturbed, troubled man, with overwhelming feelings of guilt towards is  dead wife, Mal. Cobb is desperately seeking an escape, and return home  to the only happiness he has ever known.     Inception is strikingly original not only in that it introduces a new  technology but a new terminology as well. A shoe-in for multiple  nominations, it is brilliantly edited with a superb score,  special-effects, and a wonderfully, attractive and likable cast.  Nolan's meticulous screenplay pursues its sober and somber plot (you  may smile/chuckle a few times but that is it) with grace and  high-intelligence.    I wish I could sum up the meaning of the movie, but I can't. One  possibility is that Inception is an allegory of the movie experience, a  dream of movies if you will. There is a strong overlap in what Cobb and  his team are pursuing with the movie experience itself as a shared  dream in which we share our emotional secrets. Nolan plays on this, but  the idea of a movie as reflexive of and subversive to one's life has  been often done and it is unclear if Inception adds much.     Another is that Inception should be taken as a movie of dreams, i.e. on  its own terms; that it works best if one simply accepts what is being  shown on the screen and goes with it. Admittedly, for most, multiple  viewings will be required to enable them to get to the heart of the  movie's emotions but they will be amply rewarded if they do. The  central vision in Inception of life's tragedy is compelling. Whether in  the dream state or in reality, we cannot escape ourselves and it is  impossible to tell if the happiness we have is real or an illusion.
B0000004F9|5.0|Like many of Soft Machine's utterly-rabid fans, I've spent the last forty years kowtowing to the Holy Grail of the 3rd album, while also greatly enjoying these two as brilliant development albums. (Also like many rabid fans, I quite rightly ignore anything made after Wyatt left.)<br /><br />But recently, while listening to an enormous playlist that shuffled randomly, a couple of these tracks came up, and they were utterly jarring and incomplete, out of context.<br /><br />So I deleted them, dusted off the CDs, and re-ripped each side as a single track. Truth is: each \\"track\\" was artificially and randomly named. To quote: \\"Acting on a recommendation from Zappa, the band split the main tracks into smaller pieces that were given arbitrary names taken from sound effect tapes in the studio.\\" (The naming convention they came up with is just utterly Soft Machine, ain't it?)<br /><br />When restricted to listening to each side as a single composition, they move to equal stature with the Mighty Third album. Sure: \\"But as I'm not, and of course I don't, and as I'm free, white and twenty-one\\" doesn't quite match the simple lyricism of: \\"Oh but I miss the rain, ticky-tacky-ticky\\", but all the same genius, the joy, the conflict (this was never a happy band) is there in full. And as I'm writing this, I'm currently listening to \\"Moon in June\\", but of course just to make sure I got \\"ticky-tacky-ticky\\" correct :-)
B003L20IE2|5.0|This movie is a gem and instant cult classic.   Within the first 15 Minutes of the film I found myself laughing to all the small jokes in the film.  I have been back 3 times to see this movie, and pick up new things every time I see it.   From the font they randomly display on the screen to the little details from the comics.    I highly recommend this as one of the best movies that's honestly original.
B001TW68P4|4.0|I discovered The Turtles (who eventually evolved into the group Flo and Eddie) last year, and have since come to see them as an incredibly underrated band.  It seems few people who didn't live through the 60s (I myself did not) have even heard of them.  The Turtles had only a few hits that remain well-known today.  I suspect that most people have heard \\"Happy Together\\" and perhaps even \\"Elenore,\\" but there are plenty of songs on here that were once very popular (for example, \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" hit #8 in 1965, but isn't particularly well-known anymore).  But while I would not rate them on the level of, say, The Rolling Stones, as far as artistic merit, I do like them just as much, and I find it a pity that they have been so forgotten.          If you haven't heard of them, you should really give them a shot.  The rhythms are infectious, the vocals are impressive--Kaylan has a fantastic rock n' roll growl--and the melodies are frequently quite beautiful.  To be honest, the lyrics are rarely notable, though \\"Me About You\\" is a beautiful exception.  I could listen to that one all day.          If you are familiar with The Turtles, chances are you will be pleased with this collection, which includes their more well-known songs, like \\"Happy Together,\\" and some lesser-known ones, like \\"Outside Chance.\\"  You might also appreciate the bonus track, which is a Camaro commercial.  It's quite catchy, actually. :)        As with any greatest hits album, this collection is lacking a few  The one omission of this collection is \\"Eve of Destruction,\\" originally a Barry McGuire song.  Yes, it's a political protest song about the turmoil of the 1960s and doesn't really fit in with the rest of the collection, which is incidentally love-themed, but it is very powerful, and I highly recommend that you check it out.        A few of the songs on this collection are just spectacular covers, rather than original performances, and some of them were written by outside songwriters.  \\"It Ain't Me, Babe\\" was originally Bob Dylan and was also covered by Johnny Cash, but listen to a few versions and see who does it best; I know who my choice is.  If you're a purist, this might bother you.  However, the group can't really be judged for performing other people's stuff--keep in mind that this was a natural and accepted practice for even the most legitimate bands until The Beatles came along and revolutionized the rock industry.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|What's to say about this gem of a film except to hail it as the biggest guilty pleasure of the 90's.  Elizabeth Berkley deserves all the stops playing the temperamental but oh-so fine drifter slash stripper who'd throw anyone down the stairs for a chance to highlight a popular Las Vegas revue. Not only does her wish come true, but mega problems soon follow, like jealousy, rape, revenge à la Ninja--all among her highly-respected peers, or so it seems.   The used and abused theme the film carries throughout its nearly 135 minute run never misses a beat. Paul Verhoeven (knowingly?) creates a \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" world where anyone who's anyone looks fabulous while suffering greatly in the name of Goddess (the title of the Las Vegas revue, don't you know).  But the film's biggest asset, besides the many deliciously laughed out moments(unintentional, of course), is its star, Miss Berkley,  bless her heart. Not only does she give heart and soul into her role but, contrary to everyone on-screen, she seems to be the only one who's not in on the \\"joke\\".  And that's exactly why her performance, as the film itself, is a must-see.  Moreover, the extra features on this Fully Exposed DVD edition (the one minus the complementary accessories) even includes the famed commentary by witty man and \\"Showgirls\\" devotee David Schmader.  You'll giggle so much over the massive movie cheesiness that you'll want to repeat the experience again and again.  Now, if only the director and star were attached to the rumored sequel floating around, life would sure look like a big bowl of Versace dresses.  Or should we say Ver-sayce? Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Like many of you who purchased the first two ultimate editions at a pretty penny, i was expecting extended editions of movies 3 and 4.   What a disappointment!  Were the big wigs at WB thinking that their fans would triple dip editions when they bring out all films in one super ultimate collection?  I already owned all of the HP on Blu, but sold them when i started buying the Ultimate editions.  I will NOT be purchasing 3 and 4.  Very poor on WB's part to say its ultimate, and include 8 hours of bonus materials, but not the few extra scenes that regularly show on TV.  Very poor indeed.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I am amazed by people who can literally make something incredible out of what most of us would consider trash. The ingenuity and willpower that Wiiliam demonstrates should be an inspiration to us all. He lifted himself, his family and his entire village into a better place with little formal education or access to materials.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This movie ended up being my favorite one of all time so far. It is a combination of Greek mythology and modern American Life. This is a fantasy movie. It has spectacular special effects and displays 3 young Americans who go on a quest to aquire 3 pearls while overcoming monsters and other human threats. It's worth watching if you love fantasy movies, special effects, or movies that star teens and young adults.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow. I am trueley impressed with this ending. For some reason Before I read the story I thought there would be another surprise Hunger Games for Katniss and she would run out of luck, die. Peeta would grieve commit suicide the end. I thought I had this book all figured out boy was Iwrong..... Great read loved it but was differnt than the hunger games and catching fire. Highly reccomend it.

0811876373|5.0|I just received my books yesterday - notice I said books, one for me and two for gifts.  I knew I needed more than one because I have been a Bakerella blog fan forever.  I immediately sat down and flipped through one of them ... and I love it.  I can't wait to try and make both the owls and the bride and groom - adorable.  My favorite (well one of my favorites) part of the book is the photos. They are so cute.  Every cookbook should have photos of each finished item.  I also really appreciate that Angie gives suggestions on where to find the items she uses in making the cakepops, especially the candies and candy molds.  Even the non-baker can made something special.<br /><br />I'm thinking I may need more books ... I have two wedding showers coming up plus Christmas.  Can you imagine giving a friend a copy of the book and maybe a dozen cakepops?  What a great gift.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|First of all I AM A HUGE KEANE FAN!!!! That said, I never thought I'd find myself writing a scathing review of anything this talented band ever released.....suppose there's a first time for everything though. After 3 BRILLIANT CDs - Hopes and Fears, Under The Iron Sea and Perfect Symmetry - I had no hesitation in purchasing their latest Night Train. I was of course expecting another \\"brilliant\\" CD, which unfortunately was not the case this time. I guess the best way to sum up my disappointment is to ask the question:\\"Why do so many of today's talented artists feel the necessity to put a rap track (or in this case two rap tracks) on their CDs?\\" Tom has been blessed with a beautiful voice and his vocals are at the very heart of Keane's sound. As beautiful as his vocals are though, two of the tracks on this CD are completely RUINED by some rapper. I understand that RAP does have it's own fan base, but I doubt that there are many Keane fans who are also RAP fans (?). Please guys - leave the RAP off the next CD - and get back to Tom's beautiful voice dominating every track. Perhaps I'll listen to their next release BEFORE purchasing next time around. STILL LOVE KEANE though!!!!
0783225482|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites!!  I could write 10 pages of reviews expressing how I feel about this flick. But I am tired of being on FB,youtube, emails,ect.. lol. Case in point:  It is the most creative and well written and well-acted \\"script\\" ever implemented in Hollywood.  When do u ever see 4 or 5 of the best actors colabrating on a great narrative? This movie has it all! The continuous \\"comic relief\\" is what makes this movie spin! You can't get enough of this movie. I guarantee you will be sitting and pressing that rewind button until you've had enough! lol They don't make movies much like this anymore.     Word is the director wanted to include it in tales fromt he crypt and then decided at the last minute to go solo on this one! great choice!!
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first two books, because the were just pure and simply good reads. In the Mockingjay I just feel as if there were way to many missed opportunities, by the author, to bring the readers emotions into play. After spending two days reading the book, and three days reading the reviews, (some of the chapters in the book are shorter than many of the reviews. To funny) I simply want to say that with all the deaths that took place in this last book, there were just to many missed opportunities with bringing the reader in emotionally. This was not a bad book, but I probably would not have chosen to finish it, had I not read the first two.
B001R60ESE|5.0|The concert was first class and the inclusion of other popular artists made it really great!
0439023513|2.0|I just finished Mockingjay five minutes ago, and I'm so disappointed. I don't even feel like I've read a book from The Hunger Games series. When I was reading it I kept thinking, where is Katniss? It didn't even feel like I was reading from her point of view. I didn't feel any of the emotions that Katniss was going through. It was all so blah. I feel completely drained after reading this book. Not the usual pumped up feeling I got from The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I just don't feel a sense of closure with this book.  -Spoilers-    There were a few key points that totally ruined the book for me.  #1 Finnick's death is written so insignificantly that I didn't figure out right away that he had died. The writing tried to be very poetic and sophisticated when it usually came off as too wordy and confusing. And why spend so much time writing him as this major character, one that Katniss actually trusts, and then throw him away with three other non-important characters.  #2 Prim's death just seemed like such an after thought. If anyone in Katniss's family should have died, it should have been their mother, for wasn't the whole series based on the fact that Katniss entered the Hunger Games in order to save her sister's life? Just to have her burned in a street as a medic? WHAT? Basically, everything Katniss accomplished was for nothing because Prim died anyway. I could not believe that. That is honestly just so poorly thought out. And I kept waiting for Katniss to have the thought, \\"All of this was for nothing.\\" But it never came.   #3 How can you wrap up the Gale/Peeta love triangle in just a few sentences. We've waited two books to know who she chose's only to find out in a paragraph? I was waiting for the Peeta/Katniss make up scene the whole book and got nothing. It blew my mind.   #4 We were totally left hanging on ALOT of things. What exactly happened to Cinna? How did Gale turn out? Does she see her mother? I mean it's just like, come on wrap up the story please!    I honestly will view this as completely separate series from the first two. There was no life in this book. I didn't feel that itch to just keep going. But luckily there's enough life in the first two to keep me satisfied with the series.

B0036EH3X4|2.0|I will preface this review by stating that I did love this show.  It ranks as one of my favorites of all time. I won't allow the ending to take away from that.  Lost was that unique show that one would wait for each week with baited breath.  With that in mind, I just can't find reason to excuse the finale.  The show was about characters, yes, but it also was about the mysteries of the island.  One cannot ignore that.  To simply end the series with an \\"Oh the island is magic\\" just does not suffice.  All of the mysteries amounted to nothing more than Jacob's rules for said island.  There might as well have been unicorns and elves living on the island as nothing that occurred was ever going to be explained by the writers anyway.  I have spent much time pondering over the ending and only now was I able to articulate what I felt.  The actors wrtr essentially what elevated the show above the material.  But the story itself amounted to nothing much.  I enjoyed the journey, but the destination proved to be a major disappointment.
0374158460|5.0|Jonathan Franzen's new novel, like his last novel The Corrections, has already garnered a great deal of hype. As was the case with that book, this novel is certainly worthy of the hype. Franzen will no doubt be remembered as of the great novelists of this age of American literature. I will begin by stating that I felt The Corrections to be better overall; however, this is certainly a great novel and is well worth the reader's time. I was particularly intrigued by the opening which essentially revels much of what is to take place in the book in regard to the Berglund's; this opening brings to mind the opening of William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!, as it does the same. Faulkner was interested in exploring egregiously dysfunction families in many of his works; Jonathan Franzen has proven himself to be interested in this concept as well. He expertly paints a portrait of the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of this family, and charts their attempt to become better people while attempting to effect a meaningful existence.       This novel also deals heavily with the American politics of the 2000's, with a particular emphasis on environmental concerns. Franzen meditates upon these issues without becoming turgid or pontificating. The novel is primarily interested in the ways in which these political times affect the characters and influence their lives. By doing this, Franzen provides a telling portrait of what it was like to exist in America during this previous decade. The character development is the strongest feature of this novel; it has been some time since a have felt so connected to a novel's characters. Franzen displays as much acumen in regard to the ways in which the human psyche functions as he does with turbulent contemporary politics. The main thing that one can grasp from these characters is that they are deeply estranged from others. This is due to a variety of issues: pursuit of abstract ideals, narcissistic inwardness, blind ambition, and so on. Itbecomes clear that they wish connect with others in their lives by forgiving them their idiosyncrasies and become better people. A great deal of the novel deals with these characters' attempts to accomplish this goal. These characters are not perfect and are certainly not heroes, they are instead human. Franzen has constructed a novel that is pedagogical, eloquent, accessible, and compelling in equal measure, thus making it certain that this is a novel that will be remembered.

Through the eyes of 10 yr old Sarah her inner survival & resilience, along with Julia's Jarmond intensive search of what became of little Sarah fuel this mighty moving story.  This Book has made me a better person and this has changed my life. I now see the world differently and I am grateful to God to be alive, No matter the circumstance.

B003T0G9XU|4.0|Tiffany Aching is the witch of Chalk, which means that she has to do all the messy rural stuff that witches do. But witches aren't always as appreciated as they should be, and Terry Pratchett's \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" flings the sensible young girl -- and the Nac Mac Feegles -- against a threat that really, really doesn't like witches.<br /><br />Tiffany is doing the usual witchy rounds in Chalk -- nursing the sick, burying the dead, watching cheese races, and rescuing the occasional girl from an abusive father. Then the local Duke expires after a long illness, and it's up to Tiffany to tell his son Roland and his \\"watercolour-painting wife-to-be\\" about what happened.<br /><br />The problem is, she's being stalked by a creepy eyeless man with a vile psychic stench, who is inspiring people to hate and distrust witches. Suddenly stones are being thrown, accusations are being made, and Tiffany even finds herself in the Ankh-Morpork jail. And if Tiffany doesn't find a way to stop the Cunning Man, things will get very toasty for the witches...<br /><br />Due to having Alzheimer's disease, Terry Pratchett had to dictate \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" instead of the usual computer typing. As a result, the book's beginning is very rambly and scattered, as if Pratchett hadn't fully thought out how the plot was going to go -- but after the Duke's death, things start to tighten up and move faster.<br /><br />And Pratchett hasn't lost any of his delicious wit, whether it's poking fun at cliches (the cackle box!) or sharp dialogue (\\"Have you boys got no shame?\\" \\"I couldnae say, but if we have, it probably belonged tae somebody else\\"), or his knack for writing truly chilling moments, such as Tiffany seeing the Cunning Man's holes-where-his-eyes-should-be.<br /><br />But unlike authors who talk down to \\"young readers,\\" Pratchett doesn't shy away from realistically dark moments, like Tiffany caring for a girl who was badly beaten by her father until she miscarried.

B003OJBWGK|5.0|Best Coast is an interesting mix. On one hand, you have these effervescent teenage girl type lyrics, straight from pop songs of the 60s (Bethany Cosentino notes she likes early Beatles better than post-65 Beatles, and I'd say the influence on this is indeed from the first half of that decade).  On the other hand, you have guitar tones and playing that sounds more like Sonic Youth or My Bloody Valentine in places.    While this is called Surf Rock by the lazy press, it isn't in that vein at all - it's more like the Breeders or Liz Phair. INdie rock sung by a girl. Best Coast are good song writers and there are certainly some catchy tunes on here.  I caught a song on AM radio 770 in Minneapolis and was interested enough to seek out the name of the artist. I was surprised to see that they have a bit of a buzz and even a backlash, as I had no idea based on just hearing a song on AM radio.  Sounds pretty good, I'd go see a  Best Coast show.
1400052173|4.0|This amazing book of non-fiction by Rebecca Skloot  reads like a great novel.  And it seems like a science fiction tale. A poor uneducated 31 year old mother of five dies of an extremely aggressive cervical cancer in the charity ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951. Most of her family does not even know that she is being treated for cancer. During one operation, a section of tissue is given to another doctor in the hospital to culture. When the cells began to grow and multiply, an industry is born.    To add to the drama, the family of Henrietta Lacks has no idea that a tissue sample has been taken from her.  Henrietta's cells are used to develop the polio vaccine; to investigate cancer; to develop in vitro fertilization and many other medical advances. Not only was her family not informed of the multi-million dollar industry that developed around the growth and sale of Henrietta's cells, they themselves were uneducated, poor, and lacked access to adequate medical care.    Her children grew up without their mother. The youngest two have no memory of her. One of her daughters died alone at the age of fifteen in a state institution. When her family learned of the culturing and sale of Henrietta's cells, they lacked the knowledge to even understand what a cell was.    Skloot has done years of research to write this book, and yet it reads like a drama. She doesn't sensationalize anything and, most importantly, treats the family with the respect they deserve. Skloot discusses the legalities of tissue ownership rights and mentions a number of other cases where individuals have tried to claim the rights to their own tissue.    There is a tremendous of information in this book, and yet the real person that was Henrietta shines through. This book is a must read.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book was epic. Epic in size, epic in scope, epic in it's presentation.<br /><br />It took me over a week to read, where I normally rip through 2-3 books in a week. My hats off to Brandon Sanderson for writing such an involved story.<br /><br />I was a bit confused at the beginning, much like when I read Warbreaker. His magic system is very integral to this storyline and he launches right into it near the beginning of the book, then bounces out to introduce all the main characters. The world he has invented is massive. Storms coming out of the East, great walls of water and wind. Entire civilizations, including plant and animal life hide out inside their shells, gripping the ground or hiding behind rocks in order to survive these storms.<br /><br />It's a bleak existence, but one that is steeped in mystery, depth, survival, and triumph.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book in this series. I already bought the Hardback as well as the Kindle version. This is definitely one to read again.

B00070DK5K|5.0|Definitely, Bowie's at the height of his career or at least rising. This is what Bowie does best and that is live music. This is one of my favourite live albums and one of many that Bowie has put together. The live performance can either be a exact copy of the studio or it can be a performance on its own. With Bowie as best as a person can be expected to be at hus best each night, I would hazard to say Bowie is a professional muscuan and performer. After seeing this performance in Toronto at the best venue, what was then known as the O'keefe Center. The live ablum has become one of my favourites even beating out the studio albums. The piano interpretation on Changes totally gives a new twist to the song and that's where Bowie is probably one of the best live performers and seems to give his best no natter the time and place. To give you an idea see hom with David Gilmour as a guest singer, you would think he was their lead vocalist. Where other bands may be satisfied to mouth a prerecorded piece Bowie gives you a performance. Amazing Double Disk. Too bad there is not any live footage from this concert.
B003EYVXYG|1.0|I am a die hard Romero fan.  So, when George has something new I buy it without even thinking.  Unfortunately, \\"Survival of The Dead\\" is so bad I won't even give it a second viewing.  It's like his creative seed has dried up and blown away.  Mr. Romero, I apologize for saying that.  There were elements in this movie of the continuing human and zombie social evolution but it was watered away in a poor script with a weirdly composed dynamic that just didn't work.  I'm going to stop writing now as all it would be is more trashing of this movie.  I will buy Mr. Romero's next movie as I am a die hard Romero fan.
B000026OW3|4.0|Rubinstein made studio recordings of Chopin's piano works during three distinct periods: early recordings during 1928-1939, a more mature series of mono recordings from 1946 to 1958, and then a series of stereo retakes from 1959 to 1967. I largely agree with G Engler's review for the thoughtful comments on Rubinstein's playing at various phases in his career.    The more extensive and relatively complete sets of the named genres are dated as follows:  --Scherzos: 1932, 1949, and 1959;  --Polonaises: 1934-35, 1950-51, and 1964;  --Nocturnes: 1936-37, 1949-50, and 1965;  --Mazurkas: 1938-39, 1952-53, and 1965-66;  --Waltzes: 1953, and 1963; and  --Impromptus: 1953-54, and 1964.  (I'm aware of only the 1959 complete set of the Ballades.)    To some extent I can understand people's desire for the very best recording technology, but to me this is always of *much* less consequence than the playing itself. I'm willing to put up with some pretty mediocre audio quality for listening to musicianship that strikes me as sympathetically reflecting the composer's background, intent and mood, but I have no time for the best SACD renditions of many popular and acclaimed performers I can think of. Music is never just notes to be played, no matter how technically skillful the performer.    None of Rubinstein's different Chopin recordings can be considered \\"youthful\\" - he was already 40 years old when he began these earliest recordings. Nevertheless there are clearly many stylistic differences between his playing in the 1930s and that of the two later series. Unfortunately - and it is indeed unfortunate - by the time Rubinstein began re-recording much of his Chopin in stereo, to replace the mostly discontinued monos that can now be difficult to find, his playing had become, as Engler says, careful, polished, and bland.    But I don't think this description is true of his second mono series. I find the earliest recordings from the 1930s to be both interesting and generally exciting, but if there's such a thing as \\"definitive\\" Rubinstein playing Chopin, it's the work he did from the mid-1940s to the mid-'50s. By then his style had settled down, and he knew how he wanted to approach the various pieces, but he still retained his verve and élan that tend to go missing in the later stereos, even though stylistically the two later sets are generally quite similar. For all that the stereos may be more pleasing to audiophiles, the mid-period mono series has much more satisfying playing.    In a way we have Rubinstein to look to for our present sense of what Chopin should sound like. In their own times, Paderewski and then Cortot were each held out to be the most Chopinesque of interpreters - but neither sounds much like the other, or much like Rubinstein, and both can seem foreign to our modern ears. Most Chopin that we now hear is directly descended from Rubinstein's pioneering interpretation and playing.    -------------------  Addendum:  Several reviewers have noted (or complained) that unlike some newer recordings of Chopin by other pianists, various musical genres and individual pieces are missing from this box, or from other sources of Rubinstein's playing. The explanation for this is simple. Rubinstein played and recorded before RCA and other labels started demanding that performers record complete-absolutely-everything of a composer, and thus he played only those pieces that he personally liked and felt comfortable with.    He did record, specifically as sets, the 4 Ballades, the 4 Scherzos, the 51 Mazurkas, 19 of the 21 Nocturnes, 14 of the 19 Waltzes, and 7 of the various Polonaises. He made one recording, in 1946, of 24 of the 26 Preludes; and he never recorded either of the two sets of Etudes at all. Most of these pieces were written by Chopin at different times, and have been given different opus numbers; it's not conceivable that Chopin ever imagined anyone playing, or listening to, more than two hours of mazurkas at one sitting, one rightafter another.    Much of Rubinstein's Schumann and virtually all of his Brahms piano pieces are sublime - more than any other pianist I know of, Rubinstein manages to inhabit the living spirit of Brahms - but here he was far choosier in which pieces he wanted to play and felt entirely comfortable with. He recorded this and that from here and there - so that altogether there are very few of them, and none at all of the Brahms as a set.    Just enjoy what he chose to give us - and wish that the \\"outdated\\" second mono series of Chopin were not so difficult to find and collect. This is not Rubinstein's fault, but rather a lack of due appreciation by RCA.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|This book was great, I am definitely enjoying it. HOWEVER, the Kindle edition has so many typos and errors that I have to wonder if they placed them on purpose to locate stolen copies later down the line. Seriously, I couldn't read a page without finding a typo. If you can get past the typos, this book is a great read, but be aware there are these problems.
B00005JLD4|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, especially the cinematography and score. Lots of truth to the tale, but some ambiguity after reading other reviews. The proper course might involve research into the credibility of the actual story behind this film, however, setting aside validity...aren't movies and books about tales, fables, and colorful accents on actual or imagined events? My ratings are based on how much pleasure was derived from the medium...and sometimes its a pleasure to just be provoked into animated internal discussions....<br /><br />Sticking to the basics...<br /><br />Was it entertaining? Yes.<br />Moving and inspirational? Absolutely.<br />Worthy of Recommendation? Oh, yeah :)<br /><br />Stories woven around actual events are often embellished and even changed over time...hopefully to accent the positive outcomes and perspectives involved in human dramas...but often, the misrepresentations of some, ergo, the undue villainization of the British (or white race) is undeserved. I agree with one reviewer who urges people to check out the facts, so easily available on the internet....especially if the film succeeds in arousing powerful emotion, beyond the mere enjoyment of being entertained...<br /><br />See the movie...know that the basics of the story are TRUE...an aboriginal girl, her sister, and cousin made an amazing journey...surviving the most extreme conditions to return to their homeland. Tis worth the time...well made and intriguing...
B00092QRMO|4.0|If you go into this CD expecting \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Dynasty\\" or any of the MTV friendly CD's of the 80's, this is NOT the CD for you! If you liked \\"Revenge\\" or any of the original 3 albums... it is worth a listen.    \\"Revenge\\" was KISS's return to their roots and rediscovering an identity that seemed to have wandered away after \\"Alive\\" and \\"Rock n Roll Over\\"... hard rock that breaks your ribs with a barrage of heavy sound. I, for one, welcomed the return with open arms, as the line from \\"Lick it up\\" through \\"Hot in the Shade\\" was their not so valiant attempt at hair metal.    \\"Carnival of Souls\\", to go against the opinions of the 15 who gave this a \\"1\\", is NOT a grunge album. The sound is not even remotely close to grunge. Why would you even think that???     It is a worthy follow up to a great metal album. The downside is the band chose to shelf this in favor of the reunion. Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick stepped aside to let fans, old and new, experience the original four members working their magic once more. This CD sat in Limbo waiting to be released... eventually.    The other downside is they chose to release \\"Psycho Circus\\"... a really BAD album. I rank it BELOW \\"Elder\\"! For the record, \\"Psycho Circus\\" is NOT in my collection, \\"Elder\\" is.     \\"Hate\\" is the sister tune to Unholy, with the same gritty, kick you in the crotch sound.     Paul vocally knocks it out of the park with \\"Rain\\" and \\"It never goes away\\".     \\"Master and the Slave\\" is my personal favorite on the cd, and one I wouldn't mind hearing live.     \\"Childhood's End\\" is a slower song, but is great nonetheless. Listening to it and following the lyrics is simply haunting.    Gene flexes his vocals in \\"In my head\\".     Really, there is no weak song on the CD. Fans looking for classic KISS sound should enjoy this effort.    As the sticker on the CD plastic states \\"The last CD featuring the (then) current line up\\". As we know, Singer returned to the band to replace Peter Criss once and for all, and Tommy Thayer... who helped on \\"Childhood's End\\"... replaced Ace Frehley. Bruce Kulick, at the time of Frehley leaving the band again, was heavily involved with several projects of his own. One can only wonder what HE would have looked like in Space Ace make up. Singer really comes into his own on this CD and Kulick demonstrates why he is one of the few guitar geniuses out there today.    If you liked \\"Revenge\\" and are looking for something worthy from the non-makeup era, look no further than this CD. Should definitely be in your collection.
0439023513|5.0|I finished Mockingjay about a week ago, and was left  feeling completely drained, confused, angry. I knew that if I wrote a review right away then it would be ferocious. But a part of me knew that this book did not deserve a ferocious review. So I gave myself time to let it soak in, to really think about the book. Coming to the conclusion that with all of the hate I experienced, there was equal parts love and understanding. The final book in the trilogy is a whirlwind of everything that made the previous two books brilliant, but this one holds a much more terrifying tone. Suzanne Collins has created a series about fear, rebellion, war and love. I believe many readers forgot the first three ingredients to the story, and just wished for Love to conquer all. With this third book, but that isn't the case. War and the lives of the Districts have always been the forefront of every book and Mockingjay reinforces this. It's a war zone. The happy endings that every reader is wishing for are hard to come by, making this book so much darker than the last two. Instead of going into the war zone of an arena, we are bombarded into a real war zone with bombs, gunfire, and death. The politics of it all leaves us unable to trust anything we learn.We see a very different Katniss in this book. Another reviewer put it beautifully, the Katniss we see is suffering from PTSD. She is timid, hides in closets, and doesn't know what is the best solution for everyone. She is no longer confident. She has been broken by this war. Which I do believe that many readers were wanting her to be the strong Heroine she has been for the best two books. This book concentrates on the battle, on the strategy of District 13. Yes I hated all of the propaganda,but I understand why it was important to District 13. They need the other districts on their side. They need to compete with the Capitol on their level. Do I wish there was more fighting on the front-lines with Katniss? Yes. but she was a pawn. She was too broken to be anything else and i think the District 13 President knew this. Many readers hated the death of so many characters, but this is war. To me it shows that there is no happy endings in war. Fighting a war is not easy and there will be casualties and consequences, lives lost and lives destroyed. I understand that the love triangle between Katniss/Peeta/Gale took a back seat, and I was heartbroken and angry which is why at first I think this review would have taken a much darker tone. But none the less, after much speculation, I truly believe the final chapter of this much loved series was perfect. It might not be the ending I had originally hoped for with Katniss triumphantly announcing her true love for Peeta while in the midst of battle, and them skipping off into the sunset, but the ending that Collins gave me fits. Its just fits. It fits with the mood of the bookd. It fits with the whole notion that the young girl who took her sisters place at the Games, who won the games, ignited a nation full of hope, is gone. That Katniss is no longer alive. But the ending fits this new Katniss, who is empty after losing so much. Who needs to find a new way to live. Depressing? Yes. But it fits. All in all, Mockingjay is a heart-wrenching that will leave readers thinking about it long after turning that final page. I bet many people hate the way it ended, but at the same time love it.
030745455X|3.0|I bought this as an airport novel, and I think it turned out to be a moderately entertaining one.  The first third of the novel was quite dull, but eventually it became interesting enough to finish - not a classic by any means, just the sort of book that is a nice diversion if you have nothing better to read.<br /><br />Basically, this is a kind of superhero novel; Salander uses her brainpower, her computer skills, and her skill with weapons to defeat any enemy, including one who is basically a supervillian- a giant who feels no pain.  When Salander is not part of the action, the novel drags; most of the supporting characters are not particularly memorable.
B003D83DPA|3.0|The show portraits the best years of the band Dire Straits, but the quality of the Blu-Ray images are not good, probably due to the quality of the original shooting.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I simply love George Michael.  Every song on this cd is wonderful.  George is such a tallented musician, I just wish more people would realize this!!  This two cd set is a wonderful complulation of his work.  You won't be dissappointed!!
B000002AP1|5.0|I mean everyone has their own opinion about the various mixes, i like this one. It's Raw...what else did you expect. All the songs are just powerful songs. I personally like \\"Gimme Danger\\", the opening makes you think it will go romantically and sooth-fully...not here my friend. \\"Shake Appeal\\" is probably the only song that i hear in most college parties when i pass by. I'm like \\"What? Are they playing Shake Appeal?\\". Obviously \\"Search and Destroy\\" is the classic track everyone loves to hear over and over again. Iggy and the rest of the band were definitely going somewhere. Who knows what would have happened if they were together in 77. Get this album if you want early punk music like this. A definite 10/10 in my book.
0553805371|3.0|The Hindus have a system of philosophy called the \\"Samkhya\\" philosophy. This pre-dates modern emergence of the \\"non-dual- advaita vedanta\\" philosophy. In that philosophy a logical groundwork is laid out and the necessity of a creator is not required to explain the universe. So when Stephen Hawking says \\"It is not necessary to invoke God . . . [to] set the universe going\\" he is echoing the same investigation which was done long time back. Samkhya has no official position on God unlike the nastika (atheistic) philosophies like Buddhism or Jainism. In the end after investigation..\\"what remains..is what remains\\" And that is pure awareness.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|Prior to season 6, I would have rated Lost as a 5 star show without question. Despite a few weak singular episodes from seasons 1-5, all in all I loved this show and was a HUGE fan. Perhaps obsessively so, I read all the episode recaps (Doc Jensen being my favorite), looked for spoilers and often debated/chatted with friends, family and co-workers over this amazing show. I defended its honor when people would question the direction or label it confusing. I had, up until \\"The End\\", a lot of confidence in Cuse & Lindelof as writers.     Despite my increasing worry throughout season 6, I kept the faith right up until the finale. I will say that \\"Across the Sea\\", did almost put the nail in the coffin, but I still wanted to believe there would come an \\"ah ha\\" moment when it would all tie together. I was even willing to allow a few things unanswered questions or things left open to interpretation, but I never expected them to end the show in such a cliché' manner. I also never thought they would end the series without telling us what the island was. \\"A Cork\\" is not an answer, it's a cop out!    I also felt the sideways world ended up being completely useless and I was baffled that our Losties would choose a multi-denomination church, instead of beach, as their final meeting place. Jacob and MIB ultimately, despite a lot of indication that they were, ended up to be of little importance to the overall story. Honestly, as it turned out these fine actors played out to be more filler then storyline. There we were at the end of the road and the whole story of these two is that their non-mother was crazy and one brother flushed the other down the golden island toilet, thus turning him into the smoke monster. Huh?     After a lot of careful consideration, I've drawn my own final conclusion in an attempt to provide some personal satisfaction. I believe the writer's either had another ending in mind and for some reason couldn't pull it off. Or they lied and never really knew how to end the show. But here is the kicker, if you didn't know how to end the series or how to answer questions that you posed in the first place, why not go for another season? I'm sure ABC would have loved to milk Lost for all it's worth. You didn't do your show or your legions of loyal fans any justice by wrapping it up so absurdly. We didn't need Dogan, Lennon or the sideways world at all. We didn't need Sun to stop speaking English for no apparent reason or Shannon to come back for ha ha's. What fans wanted was answers, conclusion and a little something to think about when it was all over.    And hey, if you wanted to go all religious, why not have the island be purgatory all along? Sure everyone guessed it in Season 1, but at least it would have made all the island nonsensical stuff somewhat believable. The audience could have chalked up the millions of unanswered questions as part of some ultimate soul test. Instead you ended the show with footage of the plane crash and then came back and said it was just for fun, no relevance, the island was after all, \\"real\\"! Jimmy Fallon said best during the 2010 Emmy's, \\"I didn't understand it, but I tried.\\"
B003O85W3A|5.0|I bought this when it first came out and have listened to it lots since then.  Not many days go by when I don't get my Arcade Fire fix.  Great music and thoughtful lyrics.  Love all the tracks except for Month of May. Very talented musicians who do an even greater job live.  Go to one of their concerts if you get the chance, you'll not regret it!
B002ZBT84G|4.0|I've been delaying writing a review for this one for a while. As a life long Gil Scott-Heron fan I wanted to make sure I really let this one sink in before I reviewed it. This is a tough album to review at any rate; I'm sure a lot of Gil's fans would have loved a return to the work they remember from the 1970's after waiting sixteen years since his last release, but Gil is Gil. He has never pulled any punches, and he's not about to start now. It's no secret that Gil has a drug problem, has fallen victim to the worst of what he sang about in his classic song about addiction \\"The Bottle\\", and has been to prison since his last album was released. He doesn't gloss anything over with \\"I'm New Here\\". The many spoken word clips (and I say clips because in some instances they are not poems or full spoken word pieces, but could more aptly be described as studio banter) that make up half of this disc are confessions, self deprecating jokes in some instances, and thoughts from Gil. The two part \\"On Coming From a Broken Home\\" is more of a fully formed spoken word poem, and is the exception. Most listeners probably had the same reaction as I did when first hearing Gil's version of Robert Johnson's \\"Me And The Devil\\": that Gil's voice has seen better days. However, I saw Gil perform in New York city in November 2009, and his vocals were noticeably smoother than on some of the songs on \\"I'm New Here\\". I can only conclude that this strained vocal style was a production choice, and an odd one considering that Gil has never had to scream or strain his voice in order to convey emotion in the past. His vocals on the more relaxed title track and the standard \\"I'll Take Care Of You\\" are easier on the ear, and are that much more effective. Also effective is Gil's mix of restrained singing and spoken word on the track \\"I'm New Here\\".<br /><br />To conclude, I had mixed emotions after listening to this album for the first time, and would have rated it two or three stars at best. Yes, I felt sad that Gil has fallen on hard times, and I was disappointed that this disc didn't leave me wanting to play it again. But I can appreciate the honesty and courage that it took for Gil to release such an album, when most music today is as transparent as saran wrap. As I stated before, I saw Gil perform in NYC in November of 2009, right before this album's release. He showed up over an hour late for the show, and did stand up comedy for the first 45 minutes, which was hysterical. Through it all the man had not forgotten how to laugh, and how to make others laugh. When he finally did sit down at the Fender Rhodes and play a few songs it was about the time that the show should have been over. However, I didn't take my eyes off the stage once. The naysayers may say, \\"Yeah, but you should have seen him with the Midnight Band back in the day...\\", but I can tell you, I had tears rolling down my face when Gil sang \\"Pieces Of A Man\\" that night. Through all the trials of his life, Gil still had not lost the power to communicate his gift and to reach people. This disc may not be the comeback album that any of us were hoping for, but it is an honest portrait of a broken man.

B001GQSY5K|2.0|Boy, LucasArts sure did drop the ball with this one.<br /><br />The premise -- creatively, I mean -- couldn't be beat:  exploring the Star Wars universe by means of digital cartoons!  What promise!  This frees the creators from having to depend on the aging (and mortal) faces and voices of actors like Mark Hamill and Alec Guiness.  They had at their disposal the means of churning out an endless series of movies freed of many of the fetters that so famously plagued George Lucas in 1976-7.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when it came time to select the theme for this inaugural outing somebody saw fit to choose the well worn \\"Hey, girls can too!\\"<br /><br />Argghghghhgh.  Several problems with this:<br /><br />1.  It's already been done!  Think about Leia as the spunky princess in Episode IV!<br />2.  Admittedly, there might be a certain percentage of Star Wars buffs that are interested in such a theme, but they're certainly a negligible minority:  most Star Wars nuts are guys and, owing to the violence and science-fictiony aspects of the genre, always will be!  It doesn't matter how many Gloria Gaynors you cram into these films, you're simply not going to make little girls interested in them, and more than you're going to make little boys interested in playing with Barbies merely because you give her a Jeep to drive!<br /><br />Thus in the end, LucasArts with this outing let down their fans (again), and fumbled the opening kick in what could have been a remunerative genre for them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hate ALL the Star Trek TV Series (I did love the new reboot movie, and enjoy most of the original movies mostly as a window to some cheesy, outdated, but well-intentioned special effects).  I hate Babylon 5.  I hate Battlestar Galactica.  I hate all the Stargate TV series.  I hate Caprica.  I don't understand the love affair with Star Wars WHATSOEVER, but I've seen the films and wouldn't necessarily say I hate them.  I've watched episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel here and there, but never really got into the shows.  I'm not even a big fan of Westerns lol!!!    And with all that said...this is hands down my favorite TV series of all times, and it only lasted one season!!!  The writing is gut-bustingly hilarious.  All the various characters fluidly interact with each other and you truly believe this group of people could be manning a spaceship way out in the 'Verse.  The acting is phenomenal from top to bottom.  Truthfully and honestly, to all the people out there considering making this purchase, i say this:  The ONLY bad thing about this entire TV series is the fact that there is only 1 season.    Now that you've got this, go out and buy the movie Serenity, the two graphic novels Better Days and Those Left Behind, the one-shot comic book Float-Out, and the fan-made film Browncoats: Redemption.  Not only will this expand the world created in this all too short TV series for you, but perhaps if the powers that be see purchasing trends for these various properties, we might just end up with some form of continuation to these characters.
B000P0J06U|5.0|I won't discuss the plot or give any spoilers.  I just want to say a few things about this movie.<br /><br />When I saw Tim Burton's first offering in the series, Batman (1989), I thought the inevitable sequel might struggle to achieve what the first movie achieved because it was a tough act to follow.  The 1989 movie was dark, gothic, and had a fantastic score by Danny Elfman that made the movie even better, yet at the same time this movie had a lot of humor (thanks in part to The Joker being in it).  As good as the 1989 movie was, I think Batman Returns (1992) at least matched it.  Sometimes I think it surpasses it.<br /><br />When I first heard about the casting of Danny Devito as The Penguin, I said, \\"What\\"?  Then it all made sense to me.  He'd be perfect for the role with his physique and his voice.  Still, I was thinking that the 1989 movie couldn't be matched.  When I saw Batman Returns in the movie theater back in 1992, I had mixed feelings about it.  I felt it was pretty good, but not as good as the first movie.  My opinion has changed over time.  Now I think this movie is at least as good as the first movie.<br /><br />Why do I like this movie?<br /><br />For one thing, the atmosphere, while dark and bleak, is also snowy and Christmasy.  This was a unique way to portray a really dark atmosphere.  The snow and holiday season add a nice touch to the overall atmosphere.  The snow in particular makes the movie darker.  This is a movie where Tim Burton had complete creative control.  It definitely has that Tim Burton feel and look to it.<br /><br />The acting is great.  Danny Devito is a great Penguin.  He overacts sometimes, but since this first series of Batman movies were semi-campy or straight campy, any overacting should be acceptable, much like how the 1960s TV series was campy and had actors who overacted.  Devito's voice sounded very much like Burgess Meredith from the TV series.  While Burgess Meredith is my favorite Penguin ever, Danny Devito did a great job in this movie and is a very close second.  Another similarity to the TV series is the fact that Penguin runs for mayor, just like he did in the 1966 TV series episode called Hizzonner The Penguin.  Michael Keaton gives another great performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Michael Gough is great as Alfred once again.  Christopher Walken is good as business tycoon Max Shreck.  Not only does Michelle Pfeiffer look and act great as Catwoman, but she looks and acts great as Selina Kyle as well.  My favorite Catwoman ever is Lee Meriwether from Batman: The Movie (1966), followed by Julie Newmar from the TV series, who comes in a very close second.<br /><br />Danny Elfman provides another great score for this movie.  His music really fits the Tim Burton movies.<br /><br />The original Batman series of movies - Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), and Batman & Robin (1997) are a very inconsistent set of movies.  You've got two Tim Burton movies that were very dark, then you've got two Joel Schumacher movies that were bright and colorful.  You've got Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman, then you've got Val Kilmer and then George Clooney.  I think had Tim Burton been allowed to stay on and make the third movie, this original series might still be going today, or it at least would have gone way past 1997.  Parents freaked out over the darkness of Batman Returns, saying that it wasn't suitable for children.  As a result, Tim Burton was not allowed to direct future projects, so they brought in director Joel Schumacher, and, well, you know what happened.  I prefer the darker Batman movies overall, though I don't mind some camp once in a while.<br /><br />Overall, Batman Returns is a great movie that every fan of the original series should have in their collection, and I highly recommend it.ose second.  Another similarity to the TV series is the fact that Penguin runs for mayor, just like he did in the 1966 TV series episode called Hizzonner The Penguin.  Michael Keaton gives another great performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Michael Gough is great as Alfred once again.  Christopher Walken is good as business tycoon Max Shreck.

The original Batman series of movies - Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), and Batman & Robin (1997) are a very inconsistent set of movies.  You've got two Tim Burton movies that were very dark, then you've got two Joel Schumacher movies that were bright and colorful.  You've got Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman, then you've got Val Kilmer and then George Clooney.  I think had Tim Burton been allowed to stay on and make the third movie, this original series might still be going today, or it at least would have gone way past 1997.  Parents freaked out over the darkness of Batman Returns, saying that it wasn't suitable for children.  As a result, Tim Burton was not allowed to direct future projects, so they brought in director Joel Schumacher, and, well, you know what happened.  I prefer the darker Batman movies overall, though I don't mind some camp once in a while.    Overall, Batman Returns is a great movie that every fan of the original series should have in their collection, and I highly recommend it.
0375842209|5.0|Very rarely do I read a book that touches me so much.  Don't get me wrong, I've read lots of great books that get 5 stars easily, but this book deserves more than that.    I did not expect very much from this book.  I had to find out why so many recommended it.  How interesting is it to read about a girl that steals books?  Sounded boring.  Well, Zusak proved me wrong.  Death, as the narrator, did an amazing job.  You completely bonded with each of the characters, not just the main one.  You start loving every one of them as if they were your own friends, parents, sons, and daughters.  I wish someone had warned me to read the ending in private.  It was embarrassing bawling on an airplane!  Don't be put off by this book categorized in the young adult section.    Easily one of the top 5 books I've read in my life.
B0000026CM|4.0|After the wonderful [[ASIN:B00005LUVQ Fahrenheit]] Toto had a lot to follow up. They did with a great job with the Seventh one.  Released in 1988, It is Toto's second album with Joseph Williams.  At this point Toto was down to a five man band, losing Steve Porcaro.  However he is still credited as a guest musician here.          The album starts off with the Hit Pamela.  Perhaps Joseph Williams Signature song with the group.  It has a great mellow intro which turns into a jazzy tour de force.  Great vocals from Mr Williams here, you can tell he's having a ball on this track. There's a great keyboard and guitar solo here, and as usual great harmonies here.  a superbly crafted song.  You Got Me follows.  A Paich/Williams tune which is just pure fun.  It reminds of George Michael/Wham song.        Anna follows.  This song is my favorite on the album.  As usual It's another Steve Lukather Ballad.  Pure Beauty if you ask me.  By this point Luke had ballads down to a science.  This one may be my Favorite ballad from him.  Great job.  Paich/Lukather come at us next with the upbeat sing along, Stop Loving You.  This one just puts me in the best mood.  Must be played loud.....and do I even need to say it, another great passionate vocal from Mr Williams.  Mushanga pulls me in with it's great African rhythm. It defiantly is interesting.        Other  highlights include the fun duet Stay Away.  In which Joseph Vocally battles it out with Linda Ronstadt.  Home of the Brave is a great join together and love your country song.  A nice closer to be sure.        I don't think this album is As strong as Fahrenheit, But it's still a Toto Classic, would have been five stars if not for Only the Children.  Good Message but not a great song.  Unfortunately, Drugs and alcohol would force Joseph Williams out and put an end to, what in my view was Toto's best Incarnation.  Toto would go on as a four man group.  With Luke on vocals.    Highly recommended album.    Mick
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is excellent.  As everyone before me has pointed out, it continues where Firefly the TV series left off, SO BUY THAT AND WATCH IT FIRST!!!    Like nearly every reviewer previous to me, even with a film like this to tie up most of the loose ends the series was left with, I STILL WANT MORE!    PS.  There is a fan-made film called Browncoats: Redemption available for order on DVD.  Just google it.  Apparently it's supposed to be excellent as far as fan-fiction goes, and takes place shortly after this film.  My copy is in the mail as we speak, so i'm pretty geeked out about being able to immerse myself in the 'Verse again.

0786956291|5.0|I've been looking to get into Dungeons & Dragons for a few weeks now with a few friends and it looks like quite a feat. I've searched extensively (being in a semi-rural area at the time before moving) to no avail to find D&D games that are running that we can join. Most people's advice I've read on getting started with D&D is purchasing the Player's Handbook/DM Guide/Monster Manual and start playing on our own (not the Keep on Shadowfell and stand alone since I read about the poor quality and it's free online), but this left our group at a place of hesitance since not only do we all need at least $30+ retail in manuals we also need dice, need to get familiar, and then hop into playing. The Red Box has been a great starting spot for us. Being the \\"keeper of the box\\" I've played through the solo adventure to get acquainted with character creation and play and the additional solo game that Wizards leaves a code for in the box and had a lot of fun with it as well as learning while doing. The DM book is really helpful and having to pay not much and receive a great introductory solo game, player's guide, DM guide, die, character sheets, tokens, and map for $20 is rad. Thanks Wizards.

When the psychiatrist asks why she is seeing him, she replies \\"I don't know, my boss is paying me to do this.\\"<br /><br />\\"No Reservations\\" is a remake of the romantic comedy \\"Mostly Martha\\", but sadly, this remake is  bland, no spark, predictable ending and overall disappointing.
0439023513|4.0|This book does have some parts where it is a little slow but stick with it! Still like The Hunger Games and Catching Fire the best but this is still a really good book and maybe..just maybe..she'll write one more :)
0143118420|1.0|The whole idea of the book is how unhappy the author was in her dream job with a successful husband and large country home, so she abandoned it all to spend a year traveling to exotic places and not working. Basically a testimony to elitist upper class problems and in trying to be self depracating and relatable, she just created a larger void between herself and the readers she was trying to appeal to. Plus, the ending was stupid. Her message was basically that she opposed marriage, but couldn't be happy without a man.    If you're going to write a book about not being able to handle your upper-class problems, so you combat them with an upperclass solution that a 17-year-old with a trust fund would come up with, you sure the heck shouldn't try to get a bunch of housewives living on 35K a year to read it....
B002KS1IJC|3.0|On the basis that entertainment is supposed to be entertaining, I give this movie three out of five. It has a simple yet quite interesting story line, reminiscent of Beowulf. It held my attention for the two hours it runs, despite non-glorious CGI and one dimensional acting from Caviezel. Yet through those faults and one less-than-satisfactory flashback regarding Outlander's past, this movie is amusing, creative, original, and worth watching. The less you know about the movie, the better the movie will be.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book makes me proud to be an American and from the United States.  It is hard to understand exactly what our soldiers go through behind enemy lines, and this book does a good job at painting the picture.  However, I don't think anyone will ever really know what serving our country is like until you do it.  Marcus Luttrell is not a writer, he is a Navy Seal, but I am glad he chose to share this story with the country.  I was also impressed at how much detail he was able to remember during the battle.  I guess that says something about the mindset of a Seal.  I also enjoy that Mr. Luttrell is able to voice and write his political opinion in this book.  He would not be able to publish this story if he were from any number of other countries around the world.  That is why the US is such a great place.  That's why he and so many others are willing to sacrifice their lives for this country.  Thank you Mr. Luttrell, and God Bless the USA!
B001S86J5S|4.0|Well, as a Major League fan I have been waiting for this on Bluray a long time.  I usually do not get bluray for non epic or action movies since they don't really demonstrate anything impressive in picture or sound, but hey Major League is such a fun movie.    Overall, the picture is good and the sound is definitely clear.  The crowds and the sound of the pitches and cracks of the bats are good.      I really liked the extras especially the alternate scenes and endings.  It's really interesting to see the different directions they could have gone in even on such a seemingly straightforward story.  Just a gem of a movie with talent before they became too huge.  Interestingly I don't think they even interviewed snipes for the extras.      It was a good value and it's nice to get past my VHS copy from TV HBO, finally.

B003KR50IW|4.0|Finally, some more Kylie! This record seems more cohesive than her last effort and with great production from Stuart Price, it makes sense. It took a few listens to get into the style of writing and get the songs in my head, but once that happened, it was nothing but pleasurable listening from then on. It's refreshing to see the artist involved in some of the writing, as well as great writing from notables like Jake Shears, Calvin Harris, Sebastian Ingrosso, Tim Rice-Oxley from Keane, and Stuart Price himself. The artwork is great, too. I love the vinyl format because the artwork is so big and gorgeous. Plus, it's a single disc, so you don't have to flip and change records a million times. Great new stuff to feed your Kylie appetite. Recommended.
B002JVWRAY|4.0|With the fifth season of \\"Supernatural\\" Lucifer broke through to our world and the angels hope of a final battle between Heaven and Hell came one step closer. Sam and Dean Winchester had their plates full as they battled the Four Horsemen of the Apocalpyse in an effort to try and prevent the end of the world. As always the show was entertaining with a number of strong episodes and while season five didn't quite deliver in the way that season four did, it was still a very good season with a number of clever episodes. Highlights include \\"Changing Channels\\" where Dean and Sam get plopped into \\"TV Land\\" as Dean calls it and \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" where all the OTHER gods not mentioned in the Christian Bible meet up because they are ticked off that it's the end of the world and want to do something about it...that something includes kidnapping Dean and Sam.<br /><br />\\"Supernatural\\" has always stood apart from other series like it because of its ironic touch in both the writing and directing, as well as the strong performances from series regulars Jard Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver and the marvelous Misha Collins (who became a regular with the fourth season as the angel Castiel).<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"Supernatural: The Complete Fifth Season\\" looks quite nice with deep, rich blacks and a nice representation of the washed out colors that are a hallmark of the series. I would imagine that the DVD looks quite nice as well since Warner has always done a nice job of presenting the series in that format as well.<br /><br />The option to skip the opening \\"Then\\" recap didn't make it to the menu this time why they forgot to include this as part of the authoring of the disc, I'm not sure of--perhaps they just forgot. A minor flaw but considering that most of the other Blu-rays or DVDs had this option (I'm not sure about the season five DVD), it is a bit annoying but not a deal breaker.<br /><br />Although the studio isn't quite as generous with the extras this time around (there's only one commentary track on the fourth episode \\"The End\\" and only a series of deleted scenes for the episode \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\") we do get sort of an interactive series of short featurettes all under the title of \\" Supernatural Apocalypse Survival Guide: Bobby's Exclusive Video Collection\\" and the \\"Ghostfacers: The Web Series\\" as extras here.<br /><br />The fifth season of the show suffered from padding especially when compared to the previous one (for example \\"99 Problems\\" where a militia group battling demons discovers that they have evil among them has an interesting premise that receives pedestrian execution all around) with a couple of episodes not quite living up to their potential and a sense that the story arc from season four was dragging on a bit too long. Still, the writers/producers Eric Kripke (also the creator of the show), Ben Edlund and Sera Gamble still delivered a series of terrific episodes that were highlights for season five.<br /><br />There were also some fans who were a bit disappointed that the season finale wasn't bigger and bolder but given that the series was working on a TV budget and not a feature film budget along with the fact that the show has always focused on the characters more than the visual effects, I found it satisfying for the most part.<br /><br />Overall the fifth season of \\"Supernatural\\" (which was originally to be the last season which explains why some characters that we've learned to love over the course of the series were killed)continued to explore a series of strong, suspenseful, amusing and insightful stories. While there were a few filler episodes during the season or some that were a bit ordinary in execution, overall the fifth season was extremely good and quite strong.<br /><br />The changes for the fifth season including the elimination of some characters does allow for a clean slate  for the sixth season allowing for an entirely new season long story arc that will reverse the dynamics of the first season--i.e., Dean doesn't want to be a hunter as he has settled into a family life for the first time and Sam wants Dean to continue--which will prove interesting)continues to deliver chills, thrills and spills with plenty of humor. The best episodes of season five are as good (and a couple are among the best the series produced)as the best from previous seasons although one gets the sense that this season would have benefited from a smaller number of episodes.<br /><br /> Fans will be pleased with the set and I can highly recommend this season as it brings the five year story arc to a satisfying close tying all of the elements established in the first episodes of season one together very nicely.<br /><br />Highly recommended.irst season--i.e., Dean doesn't want to be a hunter as he has settled into a family life for the first time and Sam wants Dean to continue--which will prove interesting)continues to deliver chills, thrills and spills with plenty of humor.

1416594787|5.0|i enjoyed this book very much. as someone who only took required sciences in college, i was a little surprised to have been abreast of most of the evidence in the book.  but what mr. dawkins does for us is provide compelling evidence in a wide variety of fields.  when you read about all these facts at once you get the real sense of how air tight the argument for evolution is.    of course evolution is real, this book will only embolden you to confidently argue with any creationist armed with enough facts to bewilder even the most ardent of \\"history-deniers\\".  i've actually done so on a richard dawkins speech on youtube.  i asked a creationist (a question asked in the book by dawkins) why is there no evidence of a world flood, no evidence of a sudden kill off of everything on earth, and no evidence of a migration from mt. ararat?  up to that point i was being challenged aggressively.  after my questions this person quickly made an excuse of not having enough space to answer and abruptly ended his argument.    the one thing that i wasn't ready for was richard dawkins' eternal optimism, his more than generous compliments to colleagues, and a very witty sense of humor.  his humor which he warns as his \\"discretions\\" which he says are not always well received.  i thought they all hit, spaced perfectly, and made me laugh out loud.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is the third and final book in the series of The Hunger games.  I loved the first two ([[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] and [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]) and couldn't wait to get my hands on the last book in the trilogy.  I had a hard time getting into this book and blamed it on the five month span between the reading the second book and this one but that should have been my first clue.....<br /><br />First, let me say that this series needs to be read in order, even with the recaps provided, it really needs to be read in the order written to get the full impact.  I highly recommend the first two books but was not happy with this one.  The story left off with Katniss and others being lifted out of the Hunger Games by Rebels while Peeta and others were captured by Capital Forces.  This was a serious cliffhanger.  I couldn't stand to wait for the final chapter in this series.  What would happen to Peeta?  Would the rebels be able to storm the Capital and win?  It would be a departure from the Hunger Games but a survival game on a broader scale.<br /><br />After all the anticipation, I ended up disappointed.  This book was relentless in its annihilation and bleak view of what it takes to wage a war against the Capital.  I could understand District 13's position but the beauty of Katniss Everdeen was her faith in humanity against all odds.  It was her relationship with Rue, Madge and others along with the sacrifices that turned Katniss into Mockingjay in the first place.  Katniss does not do Rue's memory justice in this ending to the trilogy and the title seems ironic, not heroic.<br /><br />I still think this series is highly original and it stands above the usual teen fare but I was disappointed in the sharp turn into utter bleakness.  Too many threads were ignored and the new thread - any power is evil, even when used to accomplish good - did not sit well with this reader.  Katniss came back supposedly pregnant with Peeta's child and yet one sentence summed up the current relationship between her and Gale as this story begins - They went back to being friends.  HUH?  What happened to Gale during this book made even less sense.  The attention to characterization found in the first two books was sorely missing here. As much as I reviled President Snow, he was fleshed out and became a real character.  Coin was not so lucky as she remained just a name on printed page for me.<br /><br />The first two books had a love triangle, the fight for survival in the Hunger Games and the fight to remain human in a cold world.  This story begins with a shell shocked Katniss and spent too much time on morphling (pain killers) references for my liking.  This last book seemed to give up all hope and argued the old adage that you had to become as cruel and inhumane as your enemy in order to defeat them.  It didn't matter who won the war once the reader found the secret rooms deep in District 12, we now knew that each side was capable of monstrosities.  The last few pages of the book sums up and ties the story lines together in a bow too pretty given all that has happened before it.yet one sentence summed up the current relationship between her and Gale as this story begins - They went back to being friends.

B0000DZEE3|3.0|Five stars for the energy of the show. Three things detract majorly from it, tho.    1. No bonus content, no interviews, backstage segment, not even a bio.     2. The ridiculous camera editing when Anthony is jumping.    3. Not one track that is pre-Blood Sugar. They had FOUR albums before that (of you don't count 'The Abbey Road EP'), but not one track from the previous albums was included in their set list.    I like the Chili Peppers, but their fans (new and old) deserve much more than a no-frills DVD which has the show just start playing, and them getting off the stage as soon as possible at the end, not to mention playing songs that were written after a lot of people say they 'sold out'. This one didn't stay in the collection long.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|This show should've jumped the shark by now...but it hasn't.  Not for me anyways.  They've reached a point in its (very)ambitious story line where there is no turning back.  In lesser creative hands and with lesser interesting characters/performers this show would've overstayed its welcome by now.  Instead, i'm still enjoying the journey and ride with the Winchester brothers.  Can't wait for season 6.<br /><br />Anyway, you can read better reviews of season 5, just here to say i bought the target version with the '100th episodee featurette' bonus disc.  It's basically a 28 minute mini-doc with the cast & crew celebrating the milestone.  Pretty good, but i enjoyed last years comic-con bonus disc more.  Still, it's a nice bonus to have with the other somewhat limited extras(Bobby's apocalypse survival guide, ghostfacer's web series, commentary on episode 4 \\"The End\\", an unaired scene, and gag reel).  I was hoping for at least 1 commentary track with the guys and Misha Collins, just to get their take on all this out of character.  And yes, the box is the same as last year's (unpopular to many)booklet form as opposed to the more popular panoramic fold-out of seasons 1-3.<br /><br />So, all prices comparable, go with the target version.  Best buy has a keychain offer with their box-set if that's your preference.  And to celebrate the new release everyone is having a sale on previous seasons so there's no excuse not to introduce yourself to this great series.  Ok, enough of my demon-whoring(just buy it).
B003OFHMKO|5.0|I love all of Esperanza's CDs and what I loved about some of the songs on the previous works were some were so simple and whisical and just wonderful.   What I love about Chamber Music Society is that is anything but simple. Every airspace has music and sound (if that makes sense). Its beautiful and rich and interesting and it envelopes you. The Chamber Music idea was so original! HOW do you add jazz elements to something as boring as chamber music and make it something I cant stop listening to!?!?  Its soooo UNIQUE and INNOVATIVE!  And I see her growth in this CD. Its amazing to me.  Because I was introduced to her 3 years ago, I now listen to Jazz music new and old. And work like this is what makes Jazz the best music genre to me. I hope the world takes notice! BRAVO!
B003ITZBW2|4.0|I am not a fan of the Batman animated movies that pretend the comic books don't exist so I really loved this one.  It started off with a variation of what any comic book fan would recognize as the end of \\"A Death in the Family\\" and then gets into the Joker's origin as the Red Hood.  It feels exactly like the comic did and was my favorite Batman animated adventure since \\"Return of the Joker\\" or \\"Mask of the Phantasm.\\"  Unfortunately, it loses a star because the voices in previous movies, the animated series and especially the \\"Arkham Asylum\\" video game were so much better than they were here.  If Mark Hamill had been the Joker and Kevin Conroy Batman, I would have given this five stars instead of four.

0684833395|3.0|A true story:  Some time ago, I was in the Marine Corps, scheduled for a deployment in Iraq.  After six months of maddeningly boring pre-deployment \\"training\\", I had become somewhat scornful and skeptical of, not to mention endlessly disappointed, frustrated and disillusioned with, the military.  All of this had me extremely depressed.  During the few days of leave (just a few days; military policy is to give two weeks of leave, but we only got five days, and this is just one of the ways they screwed my unit over) between the end of the \\"training\\" and the movement to Iraq, I went to visit my brother.  During the visit we happened to pass a bookstore, and he offered to buy me a copy of Catch-22.  He thought I might identify with it.  I replied that I was sure I would.  I'd heard of the book, of course, but never read it, and figured that if it was as ingeniously satirical as everyone said, reading it at that point in my life might just drive me over the edge.  I was afraid it would hit too close to home, and so I refused his generosity.  I went to Iraq, which turned out to be even more maddening than the \\"training\\", stayed there for five months without incident, returned home and retired from the service just as soon as I could.  And then I read Catch-22.  As I was safely retired at that point, it didn't hit particularly close to home.  It's well-written, and very effective in making its point.  Unfortunately for me (and for any reader who has first-hand experience with the military) it's the most obvious point possible, and so most of the book's humor and absolutely all of its shock value are completely lost.    In many instances the book is simply too true to be funny.  There's hardly anything in it that didn't sound exactly like real life to me.  Time after time, my reaction to the various absurd incidents of bureaucratic inertia, institutional asininity, and higher-up incompetence was a simple shrug.   I'd seen it all myself, so why should Heller's fictive recounting of it seem like a revelation?
B003KT3NRA|5.0|The Motley Crue frontman stepped up like his band-mates before him to create a solo album. Created mostly of covers, you can see where Neil gets his influences while putting a new twist to well-known songs. The select original songs by the Crue singer brings the rock star sound that we grew to love. This hybrid album is sure to appeal to any hard rock fan and provides a gateway between the new and the old.
0439023483|5.0|After going through \\"Gregor the Overlander\\" with my 7-year-old, I was curious to see what else Suzanne Collins had penned. Upon searching, I found that there was an online fury about the upcoming release of the end of her \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy.     I noticed displays for Hunger Games events at my local bookstore. I read some of the reviews and although it wasn't appropriate for my 7-year-old, I thought I might give it a try. I was more than slightly dubious because it was YA fiction and, to be honest, I have tried several titles that have been blissfully popular and wasn't that impressed.     This story was so well-crafted I started it on a Sunday morning and couldn't put it down until evening when I finished the book. This book is amazing.     I don't know how to describe it to others except to say there is almost every kind of conflict known to man in this book. The ideal of humanity, loss, suffering, oppression...it's all there...Will it be considered a great fiction masterpiece upside Orwell and Huxley? Hmmm...can't speculate on that, but I think it's definitely several hundred notches above some of the tepid mush that is passing for great fiction.

B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|Based on a popular graphic novel.  There's an interesting focus on a worldwide culture that uses mannequin versions of themselves to function in the outside world while they stay home linked up to a virtual reality machine.  Their surrogates, as they are known, always look better than their real selves.  Real surprise there.  The story was rushed in Act 3 when there should have been more meat.  Even though there were some big names in it it didn't measure up to greatness yet it was somewhat likable.  Sci Fi types will appreciate it more.  MY GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: August.
0691126887|5.0|I recently traveled to Brazil for a conference and some birding-oriented travel, and waffled between purchasing this book (accompanied by Ridgely and Tudor's Songbirds of South America) or the single-volume Birds of Brazil by Ber van Perlo.  At the advice of a few birder friends who had recently spent time in Brazil, I chose this book - and I am so glad that I did!  Most other people I birded with had van Perlo's book, so I was able to compare the plates side-by-side.  These two books were superior, often by orders of magnitude, in every single case - better, more accurate drawings; more accurate color rendition; more updated and precise range information; and more in-depth natural-history descriptions.      My one complaint - beyond the size (which is unavoidable, given the expansive material covered) - is that some of the poses were, well, cheesy.  Such as hawks and eagles depicted in aggressive screeching poses, as you might see in a Bald Eagle image on a cheap set of matching patriotic plates sold from the back of Reader's Digest.  But don't let this dissuade you - this is the book to buy, no doubt about it!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|The Akg k702's are awesome. After just 40 hours of burn in (Pink/White noise), these cans are humming. I'm pushing them with a little dot mkIV se, and a HRT musical streamer II. Truly state of the art. Bass is tight, but not boomy. Great buy at this price. And amazon's shipping was perfect. I consider myself a budget minded audiophile. Not cheap, but budget minded. These cans are truly for the one who likes to listen to, rather than just hear their music.
B00004XONN|4.0|I love this record, whereas before to me Radiohead were just another noise on Rage along with The Pixies and other late night cult favourites. This is an amazing piece of work on a number of levels none of which I can quite identify. It sounds clear and interesting and takes on influences as quick as it discards them,Eno?,etc,etc,Headphone listening as well as housework listening.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The third and final book in the series was a complete let down for me. I read the Hunger Games despite my initial aversion to the story line, because so many friends had raved about it. Surprisingly, I really liked it. Book two held my interest, even though I felt that the Quarter Quell was a desperate idea for putting Katniss and Peeta back into the arena.     It took me forever to finish The Mockingjay, because it simply didn't hold my interest. It had none of the tender human moments of the first book. It felt like going to a sci-fi action thriller at the theater that just drags on and on. It was confusing at times and pointless. The only thing that kept me reading was my desire to be done with it. I wish I had stopped after the first book.
B00006AW2G|5.0|From the great cake cover to the smokin grooves this record in its' new guise is 'the bomb'. Abkco may be the devil according to Mike and Keith but hell they know what to do with the MUSIC! Buy it and play it loud. Incredible in 1969,Incredible today.
0312360258|5.0|P. C. and Kristin Cast have created a well-thought-out new take on the teenage vampire genre with \\"Marked\\", the first book in the House of Night series. In the world created by this mother-daughter writing team, vampires (for once) live openly among human society; humans become vampires not by the whims of existing vamps but by a vampire goddess, who plucks disenfranchised teen Zoey Montgomery up from her miserable existence with her spineless mother and obnoxiously fundamentalist stepdad and drops her into the world of Tulsa's House of Night, a.k.a. \\"vampire finishing school\\". Bearing a vampire mark that sets her apart even among fledgling vamps--and an advanced taste for blood to go with it--Zoey is tasked with unearthing a threat to all of human and vampire society at the house, with the aid of her goddess Nyx and her newfound friends. When she discovers Aphrodite, leader of the school's most powerful student groups and resident queen of mean, misusing her vampire abilities, she must master her own powers to stop her, even though she hasn't yet mastered the art of parallel parking. With themes ranging from teen sexuality to religion to good old-fashoned adolescence, and surprisingly little blood, the Casts have created a fine alternative to Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series. If you want your teenage vamps with a little less soap and a little more punch, this is the place to look.
1400034205|5.0|Simply put this book is awesome and so very thought provoking...but there is nothing simple about the story, the characters and the amount of personal insight and wisdom one can take away from this brilliant work. So very J. Somerset Maugham and worth every penny as you will read it over and over.
B003L0VJF6|5.0|I would like to assume that if you are reading this (MHO) review on this highly unusual DVD of Julia Fischer, you already know who Julia Fischer is and no further introduction is necessary..<br /><br />For the benefit of those (just in case) who do not know Julia Fischer, she is known as one of the very best virtuoso violinist of our time.  She is so talented that during the recording of Vivaldi Four Seasons Concerto in 2002, Sir Neville Mariner handed over his baton to Julia Fischer, and said to her that,\\"You don't need me here\\", then let Ms. Fischer to become the youngest person ever to lead \\"The-St.-Martin-In-The-Fields\\".<br /><br />So, let's get into this incredible DVD. It was recorded live on January 1st, 2008 in Frankfurt, DE as the New Year's concert.<br /><br />Ms. Julia Fischer has not played Saint-Saëns famous Violin Concerto no. 3 for about ten years. Although Ms Fischer had not played it for such a long time, and this is according to herself (this comment is in this DVD), it is because she believed that she had really \\"over-played\\" it. However, when she performs this Concerto again, she gave us her new perspective with mayurity on the violin concerto, this alone is worth the price of admission on this DVD. It is absolutely Julia : Sensitive, articulate and lyrical. Simply gorgeous.<br /><br />The twist is, on that night, after the intermission, she shocked and pleased the audience with her Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor. To be honest, it wasn't on par with world's \\"greatest\\" Grieg Piano Concerto performance, yet it was perfectly under control and she put out quite a few of the better known players to shame, However, that's not her point. She is a violinist that \\"thinks\\" in piano!<br /><br />Conversely, we can ask ourselves, how many of those great pianists can play a convincing violin concerto without even the time for a proper rehearsal or practice? Probably none! How did she do it?  Well, you will find this out on this DVD, which could put a smile on your face. Something that is very rare these days.<br /><br />Two concerti, one for the violin (Excellent), and one for the piano (Very very good), by the same artist, on the same night, live.<br /><br />The part that is worth the price of gold is the special \\"Bonus\\" interview.  You should not miss it.<br /><br />This is a 48 minutes worth of why and how our beloved Julia did it, and I will not spoil the plot by revealing it to you...  :-)<br /><br />She explained the whole idea and concept behind this unusual performance in detail, but please make sure you have the sub-title switch to the language you preferred because the interview was conducted in German. Then you will see it all, and how it all came together.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD as it gave us a very rare insight into a very talented young (28) lady. Her philosophy, her music, all the questions you wanted to ask, as they say, FAQs, the answers are all there in this DVD.<br /><br />Buy it and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.  If we tried to judge this DVD by her performance alone, then we are missing the point.  Have fun.smile on your face.

B002LLE3PY|1.0|Hearing a sample of the re-mix of Lady of the Dancing Water was enough to get me to steer clear of this.  The song has deep meaning for me, and I do not need it 'improved' upon....These artists (like the Stones new series) should stop trying to 'improve' on what history has already perfected. The goal should be to be faithful to original sound of the original recording and not try to rewrite history or attempt to get this to sound 'better and better.' A recording can only sound so good, the goal should be a perfection, that being based on evenness and balence, and faithfulness to the original sound and mix.... heck they do it with the original sound of 45 rpms.....what kills me is Fripp is always talking about how he 'owns his recordings'....heck, he should have let the Repertiore label do this job...I have been waiting decades for decent CDs of Islands and Wake...next month, guys....let's see them screw this up for the next few decades more....ugh...why can't Fripp just release decent audio copies of his catalogue and not force this DVD stuff that one may not want or need. He should talk to Jimmy Page. The Zep cataloge was remastered years and years ago now and nothing remains to be done with them. The sound is great and that is all that matters. Nothing has been played with. If Fripp wants to issue 'remixes' like Lady of the Dancing Water, he should do it as bonus tracks, and just give us a decent audio copy of the original album. And now Tull is doing this with Stand Up, Ian is another one who just can't get you a decent copy of his own stuff (still no good issue of Aqualung, and Living in the Past trickles out as a treat now and again), but yet he is messing around with 'remixes', too. Hey, Ian, Fripp, go talk to Jimmy Page, please, and stop all this messing around....AND NOW there is this new review (see above)where he cannot get the disk to play. I have no use for this DVD stuff, they should stop forcing people to buy them, and release a decent audio. This is what they called Quad on the 70s, boy, that one lasted.  I read about this problem before. The guy should ask for a refund....Oh, by the way, I noticed my Who Tommy Deluxe is a 5.1 surround disk. But it is a single layered disk and can be played on both. So, it was totally unnecessary for Fripp to release this in this way: EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:  5.1 audio only players are obsolete now. I guess no one wanted them. So, he released this on DVD in order to accommodate the DVD  player. If 5.1 layered audio was not obsolete, he could have satisfied everyone and released the bonus material on the Islands DVD in regular and surround and could have saved people some money on Wake, and given us both mixes on Lizardwhat they called Quad on the 70s, boy, that one lasted.

The eason finale was a shocker but it left a great cliffhanger so please help save this show the world needs more shows like this. IT IS TRULY AMAZING!!!!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie left me speechless. It's very understated-if you are expecting 2 hours of full on gore it's not for you, this movie is to smart for that (though there are some pretty gory moments that scared me-but they are laced into the movie rather then overpowering it). But because of this it's more terrifying and unsettling then anything I've seen.     A lonely bullied 12 year old boy named Oskar befriends a 12 year old vampire named Eli who moves into his apartment complex. Eli is with a strange man who is some sort of guardian to her, and goes out murdering people (for her to drink). There was something so horrifying about this process to me, the way he hangs up his victims while still alive and drains their blood into a container. I can't think of anything that's creeped me out more-except when her guardian is waiting outside the building for a young victim-this is just how I would picture a real predator/serial killer to look as he stalks victims-and it sent chills down my spine. Through circumstances I won't give away, Eli finds herself alone with only Oskar to turn to.     It's a tender and moving relationship between Oskar and Ellie, filled with small moments of sweetness. We see Oskar continue to battle with the bullies, and Eli's existence unravel, culminating in a final scene I'm still pondering. We also see little bits of vampire lore (Eli can't come into a house uninvited, result of doing this is unpleasant to say the least).    The child vampire Eli gave an amazing performance-what an actress. If subtitles don't bother and you are looking for something out of the ordinary, you should give this one a chance. I suspect this will be much more understated and eerie then the remake they are working on now, which I'm sure will be an all out gore fest, and miss the subtleties of this amazing movie.
0399536108|5.0|I am almost 50 and although I wish I had read this book when I was in my early 20s, the message of intentional and unconventional living is true for any age. So much of what Chris writes about supports and encourages the voices inside of us to break from the pack and create the life we want and deserve. Chris shows through his own and others example that it is possible if we stay focused on some pretty basic principles. I am re-energized in my own dreams by his practical, down-to-earth suggestions and hope to encourage both of my children to set their own rules and change the world !
0375826726|1.0|This whole story has turned into a disaster. I feel sorry for this guy. He thought he could both re-write and \\"Out-Tolkien\\" Tolkien, and it's never going to work. He also thought he could \\"do it\\" in 3 volumes, now 4; now maybe 5, or this will never end?    His re-write of LOTR is laughable. Eragon and Arya sounds suspiciously like Aragorn & Arwen. Same end result, I'll bet. Brom is Gandalf! Duhhh! Galbatorix is Sauron, gosh, I never coulda guessed; the Dwarves are Dwarves, the Elves are Elves, and believe it or not, the Men are still Men (I include Women, too)! Paolini's city of Melian on his map is another example: Melian, of course, was the Maia who was the wife of Thingol in \\"The Silmarillion\\". Then, you put in his totally laughable plagiarism of the most famous line in the \\"Treasure of Sierra Madre\\" movie. And on and on . . .    What you got is a guy with basically no originality whatsoever. What's next . . .  a re-write of The Silmarillion? I'm waiting with bated breath!    When the much-awaited 4th installment comes forth, I'll just review the synopses, if you don't mind. Just tell me the end game. No point wasting my time on nonsense.
0061777250|4.0|According to van Lommel, the near-death experience is an authentic<br />experience that cannot be attributed to imagination, psychosis,<br />or oxygen deprivation. Furthermore, he suggests that current views on<br />consciousness held by most physicians, philosophers and psychologists<br />are too narrow for understanding the phenomenon.<br />  Indeed, it would be convenient for ''medical orthodoxy'', if<br />the near-death experience were nothing more than a brief spell of<br />abnormal brain activity resulting from oxygen deficiency. But van Lommel<br />does a good job it making us doubt these<br />''orthodox'' views.<br />  I.e.<br />  A study of fighter jet pilots is often cited as a possible<br />explanatory model for NDE. Indeed, the fighter pilots also experience<br />a tunnel vision, a sensation of light and brief fragmented images from<br />the past. But according to van Lommel this cannot be compared to<br />the reports of life reviews, or out of body experiences seen in the<br />near-death experiences.<br />  Electrical stimulation (or dysfunction/impairment) of the temporal<br />and parietal lobes have been said to cause out-of-body experiences.<br />But according to Lommel these experiments only gave atypical and<br />incomplete out-of-body experiences, where near-death experiences<br />involves a verifiable perception - from a position outside and<br />above the body.<br />  We certainly need to hear both sides of the argument. And<br />at the very least the reader will be convinced that we<br />need more research in these areas to understand exactly what is<br />going on.<br />  The book has a long section about quantum physics.<br />Here van Lommel tries to convince us that consciousness cannot be understood<br />in classical terms, but must be understood in quantum mechanical terms.<br />  However, from our current vantage point this conclusion seems somewhat<br />premature. Surely, more research is needed into these phenomenons!<br />Whether they can explained within the current ''orthodox'' framework,<br />or needs a completely new framework only time can tell.<br /><br />-Simon.    -Simon
