B0007YMUZW|5.0|I have an enormous music collection, that spans a broad range of musical styles. Jazz, blues, rock, folk, funk, R&B, old school country and country blues etc. This is one of my favorite albums, period. It is incredibly honest and revealing. IMO Ryan's finest release. Ryan expresses heart ache and human emotion/ sorrow w incredible honesty and straight forwardness. The range of emotional expression on this album is amazing. There is a lot of dark content on this album, but I wouldn't describe it as dreary, just very real and earnest.  I get the feeling he really feels what he writes about. The musicianship is excellent and the songs are well written from start to finish thru the entire album.
0373834454|4.0|I enjoyed the story thoroughly, as I do most of Heyer's books!  The other reviews express the books very well, so this will be a short review.  I just wanted to add that in my opinion, there is not enough interaction between the hero and heroine!
B0002XNSY0|1.0|OK, all you lemmings out there, please listen up. For years, our so-called \\"film experts\\" have been beating us over the head about what a histerically funny this movie is. Have you ever heard the story of the king's new clothes? I was embarrassed at having spent good money to go see this junior high level attempt at parody. What an original idea for a movie! Hey kids, let's make fun of the military by depicting them as morons! The \\"genious\\" overacting and unoriginal characters portrayed by Peter Sellers were pathetic. Occasionally, I heard forced laughter from one or two people in the otherwise silent audience. During all the years since my first viewing of the film, the myth of this \\"masterpiece\\" has grown to unbelievable proportions. As Cher once said in \\"Moonstruck\\"...Snap out of it!
0307456625|4.0|I don't know how many times I have walked past the latest in this series and thought to myself 'Perhaps one day I should read his books'.  Well I finally got round to doing just that and I'm so glad I did.  At times this book was moving and a little sad, but overall it was the literary equivalent to a delicious slice of Apple Pie, warm, homely and comforting.  Best enjoyed with a cup of hot Red Bush tea.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book was surprisingly better than I thought. I read this book for my book club and it didn`t seem like my style but i read it anyway and was very pleasantly surprised. Scott wrote this book wonderfully. The Alchemyst is a tale filled with exciting adventures and intruiging characters, and there is always supense. You just cannot stop rooting for the good guys and hoping everything comes out ok. The Alchemyst got me hooked on the rest of the series and I cannot wait for Michael Scott`s newest book The Warlock!
B00004U8H4|5.0|I loved this movie so much. I thought that the acting was really good. I felt the guy--Christian Bale played a true psychopath. Since seeing this movie I have an appreciation for this actor's work. I had seen it before and decided to buy this movie off of Amazon.com. I have it now and love it. I definitely recommend it. It's quite a movie to see!
B0029O0BKO|4.0|Sylvester Stallone and Robert Loggia star in this 1987 drama.<br />An arm-wrestling trucker tries getting to know his son while<br />his grandfather tries keeping them apart. I've always liked<br />this film and think it's one of Stallone's most underrated.<br />This blu-ray has nice picture and sound, but only features<br />the trailer. I recommend this.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Let me in is a beautiful horror/love story hybrid, written and filmed in such a way that the quintessential \\"bad guy(or girl as it were)\\" is someone you come to relate to, empathize with, and finally root for. I feel like if I say much more, it will ruin all the elements of surprise within, and I'd hate to take that feeling away from the viewer. All I can really say is, definitely watch this one, you will not regret it.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|This book was fun, funny and got me hooked on Sophie Kinsella as an author.  I have now read 3 more of her books and LOVE them all.  Great writer, easy to read, fun to read and can't put it down.
0385738757|5.0|Excellent.  Incredible.  Fantastic.  I don't know what else to say. I loved the first one so much, I bought this one before I was done with it, and I was not let down. This book is a perfect continuation to The Maze Runner, and you'll find it has the same infectious \\"HELP I CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN\\" feel to it. Especially for the middle novel of a trilogy, which can be really dull in comparison, this one almost completely shoots down that stereotype. As soon as you finish it, you'll be researching the release date of part three!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|This entire book was awesome.  I absolutely love Sophie Kinsella's books.  Great author, great writer, her books are easy and fun to read.  Interesting, keeps you reading, can't put it down.  Can't wait to see what is going to happen next.  LOVE IT.
B004LSO7IS|5.0|I've got to admit Nicole Conn has definitely out done herself!  I own two of her other films and this one is THE best of her work!  Bravo Nicole!  This film was the most plausible story I've seen in a long time about two women who fall madly in love and go through all the emotional pains involved in a love that both realize the truth of who they are.  For Elena, she learns she's lived a lie and has finally experienced truth of what love is.  For Peyton, she comes to grips with her insecurities of holding onto love by finding true love that lasts.  Through her struggles she finds that there is such a thing and with someone who is honest towards her.  True, the love scenes are very passionate and well done. Both Necar and Traci have done remarkable acting and deserve huge applauds and standing ovations. Overall, a welcomed film in my collection and I know I'll be  viewing this one many times to come.  Great work!
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Absolutely recommend this book.  It is fun, funny and romantic.  Totally recommended.  Read it you will love it too.
0316236535|4.0|My younger (two year old) daughter picked this out at the library and both kids (older daughter is four) like it.  They like flipping the pages and watching the monster take shape, and then telling the monster, \\"I'm not afraid of you!\\" and making it disappear page by page.  My older daughter has had issues with being afraid of the dark and monsters, and I think this book helps her conquer those fears.<br /><br />The book is very cleverly designed with strategically placed cut-outs that reveal more and more of the monster until the middle of the book when, through removing strategically placed cut-outs, the monster disappears feature-by-feature until it's nothing but a yellow page.<br /><br />I will agree with the reviewer who said that the \\"very red mouth\\" is orange.  But that's a pretty small defect.  I highly doubt a child is going to develop any red-orange confusion just because of this book.<br /><br />Great for younger or reluctant readers, but also appeals to older kids.
B000W91RUG|5.0|From the moment I saw the first episode, I was HOOKED!!! I laughed through the whole thing!!.  Great show and the cast is awesome...considering what crap they are showing on TV now a days, it is refreshing to see a show like The Big Bang Theory that actually puts a smile on your face.
B003S6T5AE|5.0|Read in Rolling Stone about the Legacy re-issue, and was intrigued.    This is the first re-issue I've purchased, when already owning the original on CD.    A total of 23 \\"new\\" tracks... yes please!    I became of fan of the band with their release of Hollywood Town Hall.   It grabbed me and held on, even to today.       TTGG was not as \\"easy\\" of an album.  It was more spread out, musically, a little less twangy perhaps, than Hollywood, and FAR less twangy than Blue Earth.    It's not too great a stretch to say that TTGG sounded like a different band, save for the vocals.     But it grew on me.  The harmonies, the realization that I was singing along to the whole CD, while driving...    Pop-tinged Americana at it's finest.    The Legacy edition - 18 demos comprise the second CD.     And, let's be honest - They're demos.    Two guys, acoustic guitars, recorded originally onto a 90 minute cassette.     First half or so feature some nice, subtle fiddle.      But they're a great illustration of the idea that sometimes, simple is best.    They sound great!    The bonus tracks on the first CD -     The title track for Tomorrow The Green Grass, which didn't make it onto the album (guess they liked the title anyhow) - rocks.          A great re-issue of a fantastic album by an underrated and often over-looked band.     Highly recommended.
B003OCWF6I|4.0|I actually liked the movie. The action was great and the characters individuality on what they each brought to the table was good. The story line though is your typical plot 5 guys working for the CIA are being betray as the CIA is trying to kill them now they are out for revenge as well out to get their life back. So as I said story line ok action good. Also goofy at times but it still made me laugh.<br /><br />Maybe a SPOILER<br /><br />Why did my boy Idris Elba go to the dark side, *seriously* *really* lame
0439023521|5.0|The characters were well developed and the imagery was wonderful. Each book in the series got more exciting. My only complaint is that the series is over. Great job Suzanne Collins!
0765326353|4.0|Last few months, I have been so tired after reading Robin Hobb's Soldier's Son series. The 2nd of the series was making my mind go numb because the book was so boring and nothing ever happened. I was going to give up on reading Fantasy for a while.    But then I started on Way of Kings and what a REFRESHING change for once. Got my energy back and almost done with the book and disappointed I'm going to have to wait for the 2nd volume. *sigh*    The pace is great and the characters are very interesting. Of all the books I have read, my favorites are Geroge R Martin (except for his last one Feast of Crows which is crap), Magician series, and the first few of Wheel of Time, Dragonworld, Dragonlance, andn ow Brandon Sanderson.
B004D7GU3C|1.0|This album is a major disappointment.  The songs are bland and boring, and the only song I really like is The Best Thing About Me Is You (a corny song that is catchy and silly).  It seems that Ricky has run out of ideas.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I don't care if some claim it is a Digimon movie remake.  To me this is on another level then Digimon.  I am 28 years old and have only remember slightly seeing some episodes in my younger days.  This anime was breathe taking.  There was not a single dull moment through out the entire movie.  It had everything comedy, action, romance, and family standing by each others side.  I also happen to be a huge fan of Brina Palencia so it was a bonus to have her playing the voice of Natsuki.  I will not give away to much of the plot of the movie so i will just say if you enjoy a fun anime with lots of action and amazing story telling this anime is definitely for you.  It ranks up there with my other favorite animes of all time, classics like akira and other less known animes such as Ninja Scroll and any anime with Brina as a voice actress, Beck, School Rumble, ect...
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I am in the military and the multi-tool is the most important non issue item that you carry on you from day to day because you always need to fix things as they become broken and things come up.  You can't always carry around a tool kit with you, and this is just an amazing, functional one that has everything that you need and easy to get to and use.  The grip is awsome.  I have had lots of different multi tools in the past.  leatherman's are horrible, actually had the pliers break off in mission once.  Most Gerber's tend to rust and it makes the sliding function difficult.  SOG has been my go to but big and bulky and really expensive, so when it got lost (pretty sure stolen) I replaced with this after being really happy with a bear knife I had purchased and I think this is probably teh best of his line.  A must have.
1400106915|5.0|Hearing Jane Austen with a great British accent is the way to go. You can listen in the car or at home while you are cleaning or relaxing.  It is great!
B000F8O35U|1.0|I ordered this DVD about a month ago on 1/15/10 and its now 2/16/10 and we are still waiting for it I might consider cancelling the order and purchasing somewhere else.....

B000BBOUCW|5.0|This is a truly wouderful film! I would defifnatly recommend it to any final fatasy fan. the graphics are amazing and the characters look so realistic, the UMD film will work on the Australian psp 3000 and it is in english too.It's a great film and funny too! I give it 5 stars!
B000OPOAJS|4.0|This is a very good action-packed movie.  It has great chase scenes, and beautiful scenery.  Brings back memories of our trip to France.
1400032717|4.0|This story provides an informative and interesting look into the world as viewed by a young man who is autistic.  Although I could not put the book down because I wanted to find the answer to the \\"incident,\\" I was put off by the profanity.
B001FB5634|5.0|Great Movie. I read the book and had to see the movie. Viggo Mortensen and Chalize Theron were fantastic actors, including the little boy who was amazing....\\"Papa\\". Really makes you think. The cinematography was so realisitic with the gray of the sky and the fires and eaerthquakes. Great Movie!!!
B001UDPAB0|5.0|These movies are meant to be fun. Nothing in common with the original, except the name of the main character, and the fact that its about a merry band of thieves. These movies always bring a smile to my face, and always make me cheer for the criminal.
B00003CXA6|5.0|was happy to find this as my old vcr tape was destroyed-received in great shape and would buy from them again-thanks
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I think that this film is a fun and modern take of the traditional Romeo and Juliet. It appeals to young people and shows the book in a way that they can understand.
0142428280|3.0|The characters are well developed but the incredible circumstances and coincidences that surround them meeting each other all the time, no matter how unusual the circumstance, kind of ruins the book. I listened to this as a German language audio book downloaded from audible.de.  However, if you would like to trip back through time with a well researched, but shallow soap opera with lots of sex, this might be the book for you. I didn't hate it and after 34+ hours of listening to this book on long drives across Texas and on my hour long daily commute, I want to know more about all the characters. Stupid soap operas.....they su ck you in, no matter how much they might s*ck themselves. It's not bad, but don't expect too much.
B004M8KLYQ|5.0|Slavoj Zizek describes in a recent work (\\"Living in the End Times\\") that due to the \\"Unbehagen in der Kultur, (the discontent/unease in culture) we are experiencing under liberal capitalism[...] the key question now is: who will articulate this discontent?\\"  PJ Harvey, no more than Arcade Fire or Kanye West, can control the direction of this expression.      Kanye, a repulsive \\"Monster,\\" lays bare the absurdities of late capitalism.  His subconscious speaks as many contradictions about capitalist society are unveiled.  He represents the ultimate representation of the loathsome legacy of capitalism that has reached its most banal cultural forms of self-indulgence, self-hate, violence, alienation and discontent.  Following capitalism's trajectory from primitive (unaided by technology) slavery/genocide/racism to the present day forms of ultra-effective and commonplace genocide/ecocide/resource wars/racism it's powerful to have signifiers such as Kanye to demonstrate our absurd time.     Arcade Fire's self-conscious hypocrisy and helplessness in their most recent album, The Suburbs, torments us as we all experience our own dishonesty and conflicted consciences as first-worlders guilty of benefiting from a system that favors our lives and lifestyles over the vast majority of the world.  This powerful album is a continuation of the themes brought popularly to our thinking by Green Day (Jesus of Suburbia).  The band provides its listeners with website links on it's interactive album (only available for purchase on their website) that supposedly help us understand ideas being entertained and debated by the band while crafting this album.  The extreme political incoherence and randomness of these supposed influences highlights the band's own confusion in understanding the contradictions of the world in which we live.  And the confused/conflicted lyrics in tracks like \\"City With No Children\\" highlight their head-scratching incoherence.  In sum, their critique is very confusedabout how to deal with place (the central theme of the album), alienation, modern man and children, police, abstract labor, etc.    And now, PJ Harvey continues the haunting and painful contradictions Radiohead laid at our feet with Kid A and Amnesiac.  Perhaps the two most anti-capitalist albums ever made.  The title track, \\"Let England Shake,\\" kicks us off with the discordant and flat sounds of an autoharp reminding many listeners (according to many reviews and comments) of the feel of Kid A and Amnesiac.  Listening to \\"On Battleship Hill,\\" I feel as though I'm watching fools and apologists rearrange deck furniture on the Titanic.  Despite its soft melody and sweet guitar rhythms, I see the frantic scurrying of people panicked against the slowly sinking ship...the tension of these two opposing paces has a nice transcendent feel for a listener who can rise above and observe our absurd behavior.    This album, like any piece of art, poetry, film or music today, can and should be read in the context of the world in which we are living (i.e politically).  Even those albums not understood as explicitly political (such as Let England Shake), cannot but be a political statement...and that is because we are indeed living in the end times.  For Taylor Swift, Lady GaGa and Co. to distract us with self-indulgent banality and cliche is a necessarily political act, and should therefore be contextualized as such.       \\"It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.\\"
B004IFYMYI|5.0|I cant wait till this movie gets released on bluray. This movie is by far the 5th greatest movie of all time. Robert de niro does a great acting job.
0439023483|5.0|I have been hearing about The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins for quite some time.  When I was reading the Twilight series most of my friends said that if I liked those books I would LOVE The Hunger Games.  My oldest son actually started reading them a long time before I did and said the same thing.  He was so excited for me to start reading them.  Then just before Christmas I found a Kindle App for my phone.  Yes, it took my phone being able to download the book to get me to read it.  What can I say, I'm an Android junkie!<br /><br />I downloaded the book on Thursday afternoon.  That was my first mistake, because I had to work the next day.  I ended up staying up all night reading the book and finishing it by 4:00 am on Friday.  Then I had to get up at 6:00 am to try and work.  Luckily I work from home and my wonderful partner & boyfriend let me take a nap during the day.  I made him a promise that I wouldn't download or start reading the next book in the series until the following weekend so I wouldn't be so tired during work hours.<br /><br />Yes, the book is THAT good!  I absolutely loved it!  It's been a long time since I have read a book that not only kept me awake not wanting to put it down, but made me want to run out and get the second and third books to continue the story.  Needless to say, I was finished with the entire series in less than a week!<br /><br />The characters are amazing.  The storyline, while not completely unique, is compelling and draws you into the characters lives like you are living it with them.  There are also so many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat (or bed, depending on where you are reading) that you can't guess what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to just about anyone over the age of 12 or 13.  My boys love the books.  All of my friends and their teens love the books.  It is a great story for anyone of almost any age.  Beware, there is a lot of violence.... gross, graphic violence!  But it's definitely needed for the story, so it's not gratuitous violence.  If they made it into a movie (which they are planning on doing) it would probably have to be rated R if they kept with the violence, but still defintely needed!  But if you start reading this book, you WILL want to read the other two, so you might as well buy the whole set at once.  LOL!ed for the story, so it's not gratuitous violence.  If they made it into a movie (which they are planning on doing) it would probably have to be rated R if they kept with the violence, but still defintely needed!

B002ZG99TK|2.0|The beginning was good, it looked promising. But then it took a step back and then it became predictable to what was going to happened. And also at the end of the movie we have 2 guys who cant stop the train, and then like all superman movies this other engineer comes out of nowhere with his pick up truck and saves the day. The special effects were awesome, the beginning looked promising, but it was just that ending that ruined it.
B003PIUC02|3.0|As far as series goes it is definitely an absorbing bloody series. I liked it instantly. As far the product goes as one of the user already complained, 3rd disc would not play on any of the devices i have. 2 blu ray players, PC bluray drive and PS3. I just opened and played it. It was not working. Extremely dissatisfied. I am not even sure what to do about it. I wish the first disc didn't play. I would have been able to send the disc back in time.

B003AJKPL2|5.0|I got this one because it has a hole for the cherries to 'reside' in.  Other cherry pitters just have a space so you have to place the cherry just right to get the center.  Not a big deal, but  still a bit of a hassle.  The scoop feature really works for one hand operation too.  just scoop up the cherry with the pitter- Cherry falls into the hole- and snap down- Repeat.  couldn't be easier.  And since there's no little case at the bottom to collect the pits it's easier to tell if the pit actually comes out either by putting your hand there and feeling the pits fall on your palm or by putting a cup underneath for the pits to collect so you can easily see each one come down.  Although I find that the pit comes out on the first attempt 99% of the time anyway.  The space saving red tail really works for saving space in a drawer too.
0670022411|5.0|A witch, Diana, who has lived her life trying to ignore magic and \\"pass as human\\" meets a lost, ancient book while doing research that magically recognizes her.  This book is supposed to contain the answers to important questions that witches, vampires, and demons have - explaining the origins of these creatures - but Diana knows none of that when the book first comes into her possession.  She simply recognizes it as a book that has a spell on it and makes a decision that she doesn't want to deal with all the associated magical implications and so returns it to the stack.  Unfortunately, other witches, vampires and demons all hear that the book has been found and begin to follow her around to study Diana and somehow make sure they have access to the book.  Of these creatures, Diana meets a vampire who becomes convinced that Diana needs his protection.  They fall in love - violating a long held rule about cross-creature fraternization designed to prevent human discovery of the creatures that live among us.  The story is about families disagreeing but supporting their offspring anyway and of Diana coming of age as a witch.  I liked the characters despite their flaws - or maybe because of them and even some of the more unlikable ones grow on you by the end of the book.  The characters relate to each other in ways that imply both a history and the sense that family is something you can be stuck with - which was interesting.  I really enjoyed how the author, Deborah E Harkness, was able to challenge conventional vampire/witch/demon mythology by incorporating 21st century technology and scholarship and by making the story about adults, not angst-ridden teens.  She has a detailed world with a long history that includes creatures that resembles our own enough to make this fictional one captivating.  The story does end in a way which absolutely insists on additional volumes to close out on the plot.  I don't know if Deborah Harkness is planning a follow-on second or third novel to continue this story line - but I will certainly read them if they do.  I do want to see how this all works out and what we discover about the origins of the creatures.

B0041KKYD8|4.0|Sexy Jennifer Hill (Sarah Butler) is your typical city writer spending the weekend in the countryside in the woods, it seems peaceful until 5 rednecks like mentally challenged Matthew (Chad Lindberg), Stanley (Daniel Franzese), Andy (Rodney Eastman) and Stoch (Andrew Howard) brutally rape her and leave her for dead. However she is alive but she is very angry and now must find, torture and kill the pigs that did this to her.<br /><br />Surprisingly good remake of the infamous 1978 horror exploitation revenge classic \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\", director Steven Monroe teams up with the original director Meir Zarchi on a risky kind of remake that does a fresh new spin on the original. I like how they didn't dumb it down and made it unrated and uncut for theaters as they made a brutal and ghastly film similar to the original but with more creative gory ways to kill the cretins especially with an acid bath. One of the better genre remakes to come in recent years besides Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, Last House on The Left, Halloween, Let Me In, The Ring, Toolbox Murders, 2001 Maniacs, Wizard of Gore and Piranha 3D.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains the one and only unrated cut which it was meant to be seen as there is flawless picture and awesome sound to go with it and nice extras like featurette, deleted scenes, trailers and radio spot.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|In the far future in the year 2154, a handicapped soldier named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) has been cryo-sleeping for 7 years on his way with other soldiers from Earth to the exotic planet of Pandora after his brother died on Earth. The RDA corporation exploits a precious substance called Unobtanium which has unique abilities to fold space as he meets with new friends like Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Trudy (Michelle Rodriguez) and Norm (Joel David Moore) as they go through a special kind of program called an \\"Avatar Program\\" where they have Avatar bodies that mixes alien and human DNA as they are psychically linked from their minds into their bodies to infiltrate a Native alien tribe called The Na'Vi. While Rich owner Selfridge Parker (Giovanni Ribisi) and his goon known as Colonel Quatrich (Stephan Lang) have month long plans to find the location of where there is more Unobtanium, Jake gets left behind as he falls in love with a beautiful native girl named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and tries to learn about the cultures of the Na'Vi for studying for soon he becomes one of the people to become their messiah to fight against the enemy.<br /><br />A brilliant and one-of-a-kind Science Fiction action adventure fantasy western from the genius of writer-producer-director James Cameron who had this idea since 1985. He wrote an 80 page screenplay and treatment in 1993 as he would make it for a 1999 release after Titanic but according to Cameron he put it in a drawer as he had to wait until the technology gets more advanced to fulfil his vision as he made documentaries while he waited and produced/created the short lived excellent show \\"Dark Angel\\". Then after he was blown away by the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong remake from 2005 he was convinced that it's the right time as in 2006 he pulled the screenplay out of the drawer and dusted it off as he wrote an original unique language called \\"Na'Vi\\" language where it's a mix of Polyesian/South-American Indian language as casting began then filming started in December of 2006 until it wrapped in early 2009. WETA who made the amazing effects for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Pirates of the Caribbean and King Kong made their biggest effects triumph yet on perfecting the art of motion-capture using briliant photorealistic techniques on the Na'Vi people who resemble human-cat people with blue skin. It's nice to see how they did it right on the facial capture including the eyes not being dead but truly alive for Cameron knew he wanted the face to capture the emotions and expressions of the characters, WETA truly nailed it like they did with Gollum and King Kong.<br /><br />The acting is quite good with Zoe being the best performer in the entire film especially Lang as the nifty Gung Ho Quatrich, while the story maybe familar sounding as many of you heard of this being compared to \\"Dances with Wolves\\" while it maybe similar when this film actually owes itself to the 1950 James Stewart Western classic \\"Broken Arrow\\" which was THE film that set the big standard for white men being part of another race movie which lead to similar movies over the years such as The Last Samurai, Man Named Horse to even both the book/film of Dances with Wolves as it was their inspiration. I gotta say it's nice to know Cameron is a huge fan of Broken Arrow since he was a kid and he stated he was inspired by Broken Arrow, Frank Herbert's Dune novels, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Heavy Metal Magazine/1981 animated movie, John Carter of Mars, Star Wars Trilogy and even Issac Ashimov's Foundations Trilogy novels since he is a fan of those things. It's an entertaining and visually stunning film that also pays homage to the works of Hayao Miyazaki since Cameron is a fan of Ghibli productions with references to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Princess Mononoke, Castle in The Sky, Pom Poko and My Neighbor Totoro. This movie became the event movie of 2009 as it became a huge success at the box-office as it has turned into the highest grossing movie of all time even with critical acclaim and academy awards, i gotta say i saw this movie 12 times in theaters in 3D and was an experience that needed to be seen. The world of Pandora is very visual and creative as are the creatures with the Na'Vi language, James Cameron did his research while working on the film even when he wrote the treatment in 1993. I gotta applause to one of my favorite directors of all time doing another fantastic film of his catalog of doing this project after all these years and made a new milestone in special effects and one of of those must see movies everyone must see in their life.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray/DVD Combo is bareboned with xero extras at all but has brilliant flawless picture and sound quality as you folks should go for the three disc Collector's edition which had three brilliant versions and tons of extras.s turned into the highest grossing movie of all time even with critical acclaim and academy awards, i gotta say i saw this movie 12 times in theaters in 3D and was an experience that needed to be seen.

0446563048|5.0|I got this book for free after running a half marathon in Vegas sponsored by Zappos. I'd heard of Zappos but NEVER bought anything off of them. I decided to take the book with me to the doctors office after holding on to it for three and a half months, just to pass the time. I started to read it and couldn't put it down! I'm not a book lover, but I do love reading inspiring stories and this book is up there with books that I quote like the bible. It's in no way religious, but instead it's hillarious, witty, ridiculously interesting, inspiring, and all around awesome. I had no idea what this book would be about, but after reading it, I think it's definitely a required read for students getting an MBA and pretty much anyone that's stuck in a job they hate or love.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Great book. Very enjoyable to read. Interesting how all the different plots roll into one. Lisa Gardener did a great job on this piece
0670022411|5.0|I picked up this book ONLY because the author was slated to appear at my local indie bookstore. I am a teen librarian, and so I have had my fill of vampires, witches, and supernatural fiction in general; reading something else in the genre wasn't appealing to me. I finished the book last night, and must say that it surprised and delighted me. Harkness' descriptions -- especially of Oxford and the Bodlean -- are transportive, and while some of her writing is a bit stilted (I wondered if parts like \\"I slipped on a pair of frayed black leggings\\" were added by an editor), the overall effect of the book is mesmerizing.  This book is well worth reading.    I have given it 5 stars not because it is among the best books I've ever read (despite how much I liked it), but because it is certainly one of the most accomplished works of supernatural fiction I have ever encountered.
1427210497|3.0|In the few months it has taken me to make my way through the audiobook of Jonathan Franzen's FREEDOM, I have noted that there are more one star reviews of this book than there are five star reviews.  And I have pondered, how this could possibly be, after all, FREEDOM is a beautifully written, critically lauded piece of fine literary fiction whose author has appeared on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as a Great American Novelist (probably much to his chagrin, if accounts of his character are to be believed.)<br /><br />Why is it, I wondered, that as I made my way through disc after disc of David LeDoux's excellent reading of FREEDOM, each character distinctively rendered and breathed into full life, that I really didn't give a toss about any of them? Franzen's characters aren't particularly repellent, they are deeply human and moving in their broken places. I could sympathize, but at the same time, I felt a peculiar emptiness listening to their lives develop and watching the looming chasm crack ever wider beneath their feet of clay. Listening to the book, I would reprove myself again and again: this is excellent writing, why does it not speak to you? Why is it seemingly not speaking to so many of your fellow Amazon readers? Where is the disconnect?<br /><br />Halfway through Freedom, I realized, I didn't care for this novel because it is OBE, Overtaken By Events. Set in the Bush era and filed with the existential and environmental angst of a middle-to-upper-middle class family, the father and mother slowly drifting apart, the kids resentful and rebellious, the nation anxious over war and terrorism, FREEDOM no longer really applies to a nation and a people who are suffering through the titanic shock of near economic collapse and the worst unemployment situation since the Great Depression.<br /><br />FREEDOM is a novel that has missed its moment in time and a huge number of people can see or sense that and have reacted accordingly. Even if the mainstream literary critics cannot and have not. The problems of the Berglunds don't amount to a hill of beans in the light of recent events and it is hard to work up any interest, or even pity, in their plight.  If this book had been published in 2006 or 2007, more of the general public may have been receptive, but now, ehhh...<br /><br />This does not mean that FREEDOM will not stand the test of time.  It may be that our great-great grandchildren will study it in college level American lit classes.  They will have the advantage of a distant perspective. But for Americans living in the here and now, FREEDOM is a novel that missed its moment. The zeitgeist has passed it by.not.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|My son loves nerf guns.  He had been looking for this particular one.  He said \\"it's awesome.\\"  I would recommend this toy.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I received the 'phones earlier today, and I've got to say that initially I was surprised at how light they were - especially in comparison to what I've been using (some old Realistic Nova Pros that I picked up at the thrift store.) However, it did not seem that build quality was compromised by this lightness. I was also satisfied by the bulkiness of the cable - it's a few millimeters thick and seems to be sturdy.    This is the first time I've experienced this type of headband style, with a fixed-length frame and a band that slides down to take up slack between your head and the frame. It turns out to be quite comfy. Ear room is more than adequate, and after about three hours of use I am still not experiencing any discomfort related to my head getting hot or to the quality of the ear pads.    The sound is wonderful. If I tweak my equalizer settings, it seems like I can feel air being displaced when the speakers are being driven at lower frequencies. A sensation I do not experience with my Sony MDR-X100s or MDR-V150s. I suspect that the larger drivers play a role here.    The noise isolation isn't anywhere near what it is on my Realistics, but this seems reasonable as these are of a semi-open build. And really, when I've got music playing, I can't hear anything else anyway.    I'd suggest these if you're looking for something comfortable to wear that also sounds and looks good. I can't say whether they're the best bang for the buck as far as the aforementioned points are concerned, but I think they're definitely worth the cost.
0060005696|4.0|This is an engaging, in-depth book about how we make decisions when faced with many choices. Schwartz's main point is the counter-intuitive idea that offering more choices doesn't always produce better outcomes. It's counter-intuitive because logic says additional choices can't make things any worse because we still have all the original options to choose from. However, the book goes on with example after example that shows logic to be wrong - for example, because we agonise over the right decision, look for even more choices, aren't as happy with our eventual choice, experience more regret and remorse after choosing, and sometimes don't even make a choice at all because it's all too hard!    The book is aimed at individuals and consumers, but it's equally applicable to business owners and entrepreneurs. For instance, in my area of expertise - helping business professionals succeed on-line - some of the ideas in the book are highly relevant. It affects the way we offer products for sale, the accessories available with products, the number of shipping options available, and even whether offering a money-back guarantee is a good idea (Short answer: It might not be!).    As with any credible work, Schwartz draws on sound research, rather than just making unproven claims (The book has 20 pages of endnotes alone). So we're left in no doubt that his conclusions are the results of science, not just opinion. However, he also writes in an engaging way. So if you enjoy reading this level of detail (as I do), you don't have to be a social scientist to understand his argument. Equally, if you'd just like some practical help, jump to the concluding chapter for his 11 guidelines on how to make better choices.
B00061S0QE|1.0|I received the order right after Christmas and the DVD was blank. The instructions kept telling me I was out of viewing area!!! How the heck does that happen?? I want either a new working DVD or my money back ASAP!!!!    Do not order merchandise from the Mars company that is recommended on Amazon.com!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It is up there with George R.R. Martin's [[ASIN:B000QCS8TW A Game of Thrones]].  Seriously.    The Name of the Wind was one of many titles recently suggested to me by Amazon.com. I downloaded a sample, along with a host of others.  It was fortunate that this was the last one I downloaded because it became the first I read and I could not put it down.  The story is gripping and well written.  Rothfuss puts you into right into his world and the minds of his characters including first and foremost Kvothe (pronounced \\"quothe\\"), one of the richest you might hope to experience.  You rejoice when Kvothe succeeds and are crushed when bad things happen to good people (and they do).  The story is well paced and pulls you along from beginning to end.  My only regret is that I found this book two weeks before the next one comes out, so I am going to have to wait two weeks to continue Kvothe's journey.    Here is the short of it:  Kvothe is--or was--the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known.  But he has put himself into retirement and is anonymously working at an inn in the middle of nowhere.  Chronicler (an admittedly silly name) happens (not so accidentially) upon Kvothe and convinces Kvothe to tell him his story.  The majority of the tale comes out in a first-person narrative with Kvothe leading the reader through his early life, up until about the age of 17 (in this book).  Kvothe, a Ruh (basically a pseudo-Gypsy specializing in performance art), is an adept.  He excels at everything he does, including alchemy as taught to him by the (obligatory) old man his troupe happens across.  Without spoiling the plot--and Kvothe regularly lets the reader know what is coming years down the road--Kvothe leads an idyllic life as a boy, experiences tragedy, extreme hardship and then begins his quest for knowledge.    One last comment:  The sample for the Kindle doesn't reach much into the first-person narrative, so you need to trustme on it--it is the heart of the story and what a story it is.

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I bought this product and was a little skeptical at first but once I received it and set it up IT WORKED GREAT!! I highly recommend it.  Note YOU must make sure that you have the newer version of MacPro like the description tells you or it will not work like you want it to.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I keep seeing reviews for this album by so-called fans of the band, bashing them for not being dark enough, or changing there sound too much, but I think, at least in this case that should be embraced.  My Chem, has created an incredibly solid record, which, while not as groundbreaking as Black Parade was, Is an incredibly rewarding listen.  The Standard MCR Soaring vocals,and punk/arena rock tinge still shines through, on tracks \\"Bulletproof Heart\\" and \\"The Only Hope for You is Me\\".  They even Experimented with some dance punk on \\"Planetary (GO!)\\" and while not ground breaking, will still have you bobbing your head and singing along.  Where Danger Day's really shines is on songs such as \\"Sing\\" which will no doubt saturate the radio, soon enough, and the incredibly catchy \\"Save Yourself, I'll hold  them back\\", one of the five songs on this record to survive when the band wasn't happy with the record they were making. The other high points are the kinetic, break neck, in your face neo-punk that are \\"Party Poison\\" \\"Na Na Na\\" and without a doubt \\"Vampire Money\\".  Bottom line, If you don't like this album, its simply because it isn't \\"Three Cheers Part 2\\" or \\"The Continuing March of The Black Parade.\\"  Give the band a break, and hell give them kudos, for making something worthwhile, when so many other bands are already copying the albums the MCR put out before this.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I'm still trying to figure out what I think about this novel.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed it when it was on point, but the author careens off into nebulous territory so often that I started to resent her for it.  And to be perfectly frank, her inexperience as a storyteller really damages her story and her characters, and the story here truly is interesting.  Matthew is every imaginative, curious person's ideal dream: to have lived through so much change and history... pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of history that the author can't even bring back around to the plot.  Historian heel thyself!  Then long \\"Twilight\\"-esque (and I mean that as an insult) passages of nauseating tween puppy love.  Skip, skip, skip, skip.  Oh, gosh, less than 50 pages left and I guess I better get on that plot again...<br /><br />Look, when she's on plot, it's fun, energetic, emotional and different, and that's why I recommend it, but don't be afraid to skip the rubbish either.
0307474712|5.0|This book had me on an emotional rollercoaster the entire time I was reading it.  I went from feelings of angst from when you first meet that someone you like, to frustration for all the times Emma and Dex didn't tell each other how they truly felt, to hope that they would end up to together to profound sadness that their story and the book itself had come to an end.  I have never rooted for two people more than I did for the characters in this book.  Dexter's vanity and eventual maturity, Emma's constant doubt about her looks and abilities as a writer had me going crazy.  And the letter, aaaaaaaaaaaaah that lost letter just broke my heart.  I want to have a Dex in my life for better or worse :)  Great job Mr. Nicholls, it was my first book by you but it won't be the last.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|Its nice to see that someone else besides me pays attention to history.  I'm just an amateur historian but most of what the author states is true.  After reading this book I better understand the unreasonable nature of Islamic politics on the global political stage.  Some people will read this book and be offended that the author doesn't glorify the magnificient superiority of Islam, others will keep an open mind and realize that dangerous ideologies always inspire dangerous people to do evil things.
B002DZX94Y|5.0|There are other recordings of Prokofiev's work for piano that are worthy of hearing, especially those of Sviatoslav Richter [[ASIN:B000007TRL Prokofiev: Complete Piano Sonatas]]. This one by Argerich is deserving of special mention, for the soloist is such a giant in her field. To hear Argerich's attack is to feel the power and energy she projects through this great instrument. I still listen to my recordings of Richter and that of Byron Janis, and I would not wish to say which I prefer [[ASIN:B0000057M5 Byron Janis: Prokofiev; Rachmaninov...(Recorded By Mercury On Location In Moscow)]]
B000YM4I4S|5.0|How many listeners who are not musicians themselves knew of the Mahler Editions of Schumann's symphonies? While I know the symphonies well enough to recognize them each from just a bar or two; well enough to play them in my head, I never took the time to study their history or their place in the repertoire. I've always loved these symphonies, although I always thought there were weaknesses in the orchestration - the sort of feeling that is much more evident listening to Chopin concertos. I have several other recordings of one or another, including some by Bernstein with the Vienna Philharmoic [[ASIN:B000001GY9 Schumann: The 4 Symphonies]], others with Szell and Cleveland [[ASIN:B0000029PC Schumann: Symphonies 1-4; Manfred Overture]], and one special favorite, the Rhenish with von Karajan and Berlin [Dg Galleria Catalog #: 419870 - [...]]. I was at first puzzled and then very pleased by the Mahler Editions, for the result seems more assertive, stronger. The edits stood out where the version playing in my head clearly diverged, yet in no particular instance was I  negatively affected by the changes. I'm not qualified to say whether the Mahler Editions are \\"better\\" than Schumann's original versions. In short, I like both and would agree that if you love these works, having this set along with other performances is worthwhile. If for no other reason than the quality of the sound reaching my aging ears, I think very highly of these interpretations, performances, and recordings. What great sound Chailly gets from the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig!
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|A film I appreciated and enjoyed more on a second viewing. But, while it's clear how influential it was on other film-makers, for me it feels more dated and awkward than Antonioni's earlier films. I know, I'm probably in the minority on this one.<br /><br />Antonioni switches back and forth between 'plot' and abandoning it to shoot a now tame and silly three-way sex sequence, or a rock group stiffly performing. (Yes, that arbitrariness is part of the point, but its a simple point we get pretty quickly). There is that great sequence in the middle, when Hemmings starts to 'discover' the hidden images in the photos he took, but other than that sequence, this didn't have the visual brilliance of other Antonioni films that offset the sometimes simplistic characters and ideas.<br /><br />That's a running feeling I have about Antononi - he's often simply judging the 'shallowness' of society and his characters instead of getting inside it, And he repeats himself on that theme obsessively. It's also sort of hypocritical. Clearly, Antonioni is judging his character's obsession with sex and material things, yet just as clearly Antonioni panders to those instincts with the endless sex and modeling, and 'cool. mod London' scenes. I'm sure he'd say that's the whole point; we're all that shallow underneath, but...<br /><br />To be fair, many (most?) still think it's a masterpiece. And if more as an important piece of film history than entertainment, I agree it's quite worth seeing.

B003Y5H51K|4.0|Based on a real life, near death caving experience, Sanctum is a thriller that squeezes claustrophobic audiences into tight, dark spaces, and forces all viewers to imagine and evaluate their personal fortitude if put in a precarious situation.<br /><br />Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh), a professional cave diver compared to Jacques Cousteau and Neil Armstrong, is on a caving/cave-diving expedition with his highly trained team and his mercurial son Josh (Rhys Wakefield).  Exploring the Esaala Caves in Papua New Guinea, the team has to traverse thousands of meters of virgin caves in order to ultimately find a connection to the sea.  The eccentric financier, Carl (Ioan Gruffudd), with experience sky diving, caving, and cave diving, stalag-might have a problem with an imminent typhoon that threatens the expedition.  The team is in over their heads when Mother Nature expedites the timeline; and they must navigate an underwater labyrinth in order to survive.<br /><br />Similar to a real surfer watching Point Break, a rock climber watching Cliffhanger, or a skydiver watching...Point Break, there are plenty of technicalities to nitpick.  The point, however, is entertainment, not a documentary.  While utterly predictable during most moments, the movie nonetheless whitens knuckles and squeezes air from lungs.  Beautifully rendered and lit, the cinematography had to naturally extend a little creative license in order to capture some of the brilliant underwater scenes.  Particularly thrilling were the wide-angle cave diving shots and the crystal clear caverns.  If pristine, unexplored worlds, alien to the average human eye were intended, then kudos are warranted.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the script (regardless of predictability), the dialogue was weak at times.  The worst moment was during a particularly harrowing moment, when water was flooding a portion of the cave system, young Josh declares to his father, \\"The cave is flooding.\\"  Department of Redundancy Department calling.  The lines not withstanding, the emotional stress on the key players is appropriate but tired.  Of course the father and son butt heads.  Yep, the son transforms during the film and accepts responsibility.  Does someone make an honorable sacrifice to aid the team?  Guaranteed.  I suppose some spokes are necessary for the wheel.<br /><br />Ultimately I enjoyed Sanctum.  As a scuba diver the underwater scenes excited me, but I'm quite sure avid cave divers won't be using in for PR purposes.<br /><br />Jasontanding, the emotional stress on the key players is appropriate but tired.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|Offering a near-perfect blend of mystery, politics and human drama, the riveting and sublime \\"The Ghost Writer\\" is one of the most thought-provoking, intriguing and elegantly directed films of 2010.<br /><br />The story begins when an unnamed author (he is a \\"ghost\\" writer, after all), expertly played by Ewan McGregor, receives a quarter-million dollar offer to ghost-write a biography of ex-British Prime Minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), who's currently residing on an island off Martha's Vineyard and whose previous collaborator's body mysteriously washed ashore a few months back, an apparent victim of alcohol-poisoning.  Not long after McGregor's arrival on the island, Lang is charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity - primarily rendition and torture - which puts the young, largely apolitical, writer in an awkward position to say the least.  McGregor's official duties as ghost writer for the autobiography take a back seat as he suddenly finds himself plunged into a thrilling round of cloak-and-dagger espionage.  And what he finds is far more than he bargained for when he initially took on the assignment - namely, an intricately-spun web of military-industrial-complex intrigue that leads to the highest echelons of world leadership.<br /><br />Further complicating McGregor's life is Ruth (Olivia Williams), Lang's beautiful, world-weary and cynical wife who's torn between a desire to protect her husband from political harm and her own personal disgust for the man.<br /><br />The events in the movie - which was adapted by Robert Harris and director Roman Polanski from Harris' novel \\"The Ghost\\" - feel as though they`ve been ripped straight out of today`s headlines.  It's certainly not hard to see a thinly-veiled Tony Blair in the character of Lang, a British leader who serves mainly to do the bidding of the United States government and the CIA.  McGregor's author is the classic Everyman character - a mere cipher but with a basic sense of decency - who finds himself suddenly thrust into the midst of a life-or-death drama, wanting to do the right thing but all too aware of the power that this Goliath he's up against has to do him harm.<br /><br />This stylish and topical movie has been paced for maximum effectiveness, seamlessly interweaving scenes of breath bating suspense with lyrical moments of quiet reflection.  As director, Polanski makes the dreary and windswept seaside setting an integral part of the drama, and Alexandre Desplat's score, heavy on the strings, echoes Bernard Herrmann at his finest.<br /><br />The performances are brilliant throughout, with Timothy Hutton, Jim Belushi and Eli Wallach making memorable cameo appearances at crucial moments in the drama.<br /><br />With a stunning climax that will leave you reeling, \\"The Ghost Writer\\" may well be the finest and most beautifully made thriller in ages.himself suddenly thrust into the midst of a life-or-death drama, wanting to do the right thing but all too aware of the power that this Goliath he's up against has to do him harm.

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Just want to make that clear. This is an uncut version of the film. It is the version with the lenticular cover.  Picture is very good for all these years later, sound is a bit iffy. I had to really crank the volume up in the film, and then the volume on the menu will deafen you.  Retrospective documentary is very good with lots of trivia.

B004BSWC8A|2.0|I am not an expert on Blu Ray transfer, but have watched enough of them by now to judge one from another. I am very disappointed in this new release. The movie itself is one of my favorites. I was excited to hear it was coming out on Blu Ray. The quality, in my opinion is mediocre at best. Usually I am in awe of any Blu Ray release because the picture is usually so perfect and unbelievable. No cigar on this one. It looks like someone took the regular DVD, slapped it into a Blu Ray recorder and sent it to me! Not impressed at all.

B003L77GRY|5.0|Spoilers<br /><br />I was so devastated with the way season 4 ended, but little did I know that it would lead to Dexter being better than ever!<br />Reading the few negative reviews here, I feel like they couldn't have possibly been watching the same show I was!<br />To me this was the most emotional, and deep of all the seasons. And I loved every second of it.  I would have never thought I would describe a season of Dexter as beautiful, but that is the way I feel. The over all purpose of the season was absolutely beautiful. It took the show to a new level, and showed a real purpose from beginning to end like never before.  The way the Lumen/Dexter relationship was written, was perfect.  It was a great direction to move in.  And their relationship moved forward, perfectly.  After Rita died, I wondered who they would bring in for Dexter, and this was better than I could have imagined.<br />I really don't understand how any fan who's watched Dexter from the beginning could not see the significance of this season, with the relationship of Dexter and Lumen. It really showed how far Dexter's character has come. But it wasn't just this part of the season that made it great.<br />The other characters were better than ever this season as well.  The way they developed Deb, and coming to the scene where she let's Dexter, and Lumen go was perfect.  It was awesome writing to put that in there, and leaves you wondering where they will take that now.  Dexter now knowing that Deb may have an open mind, I can't wait to see where that will led. This is something they touched on a few times near the end of the season.<br />Also great was now having Harrison be so apart of Dexter's life now. It's another thing that shows how far Dexter has come, and you get to see another side of him, now being a full time father. And showing how much he cares about Astor, and Cody. It was great to see these relationships.<br /><br />The Lumen and Dexter relationship is what this season is really about.<br />For Dexter to be able to see the results, and the good that comes of what he's doing, a life he saved in Lumen and helping her get through her struggles. Not just Dexter seeing this, but for the viewer to see this as well was so great for the show. It showed Dexter healing from his regrets of Rita's death, and of course Lumen healing from her trauma.  Like Dexter says they met at the right time.<br />His relationship with Lumen, and being a father to Harrison, brought so much more meaning to Dexter's character.  He showed so much emotion, and vulnerability, to let is guard down, and show who he was to Lumen.  It showed a level of him we hadn't seen before.<br />I was sad to see Lumen go. It was the perfect situation for Dexter. Someone that knew who he was, and who accepted who he was.<br />I have so much faith in these writers, and I'm excited to see what they do next.<br /><br />If you're someone who didn't love this season, re watch it!  Try again and look deeper, listen to these positive reviews, and try again, because honestly, you are missing out!<br /><br />I can't say enough, I could write ten pages about how amazing this season was!<br />Dexter is always amazing, but if I had to watch one season over, and over again this would be, without question the season!o see the results, and the good that comes of what he's doing, a life he saved in Lumen and helping her get through her struggles.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|I read this as a novel about 10 years ago and it has haunted me since. It is so gruesome and horrific in its telling that I decided to download the Kindle version and reread it during a long day of airport travel. It kept me entrhalled to the end, even though I knew the outcome.<br /><br />To imagine a story like this and better yet to think of the kids that volunteer for this walk is beyond comprehension. But the reasons behind their inclusion in this macabre event are questioned throughout the telling of the tale which is an obvious theme in the storytelling.<br /><br />It is hard to read at times, it is hard to picture, and even harder to imagine being a mother and allowing your teenage son to enlist and begin this journey knowing that the odds of ever seeing him again were 99 to 1.<br /><br />But the thing that is great about The Long Walk is the story of friendships and support between Walkers that ultimately have to come to end as each Walker \\"drops out\\" of the race.<br /><br />I sometimes wish there was some more back-story on the political environment of this world but there are hints at times.<br /><br />It always reminded me of Shirley Jackson's [[ASIN:0871292645 The Lottery]], a short story about a town that holds an annual stoning of whichever resident \\"wins\\" the lottery. No one questioned why it was being done, it just was because that's the way it always was. A lesson to be learned by all that questioning things can sometimes be for the advancement of a society.
0451205766|5.0|The Godfather is the saga of the Corleone family, and chronicles the rise of this fictionalized mafia clan. Somewhat melodramatic at times, the writing is nonetheless more than serviceable, and the novel provides scope of time and geography to plant the story colorfully in the early to middle decades of this century. There are few literary tricks or pyrotechnics, and the book progresses easily along the narrative of the accession of the Corleone family. Rivals are destroyed, strategies developed, personalities matured, as they construst their empire along along the codes of honor inherited from their Sicilian past. Not big on ideas,  the narrative does have the strength of presenting, graspable, never quite facile, parallels between the legitimate and illigitimate worlds coexisting then in the United States. Sort of a pop Thomas Mann.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|It's been a mighty long time since I've been knocked out by an album the way Emmy Lou's AIITB. Wow there's nothing even faintly resembling a clunker here. The last time I completely flipped out over one of her collections  probably goes back to the days of \\"Last Date\\", \\"Luxury Liner\\" and \\"Elite Hotel\\". Yes this one is absolutely up to the mark with those aforementioned master works by Emmylou Harris. \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Moon Song\\" and \\"All That You'll Have Is Your Soul\\" all beautifully told ballads and so is \\"Broken Man's Lament\\", (\\"sing it like Patsy Cline\\"...Yea Emmy...You sure can). And what unique intrepetations of Billy Joe Shaver's \\"Old Five & Dimers (Like Me) and Merle Haggard's timesless old chestnut \\"Kern River\\", both wonderful duets with Mike Auldridge. They just nail both, believe me.     Yes the Blue Kentucky Girl has been going strong for many years, and many more we hope, but this collection is all anyone could ask of a perennial song bird such as she. It's \\"All She Intended It To Be\\" and more than anyone could ask of her. Thank you Emmy Lou. I'll be lovin' this collection for a long long time and so will you. Give it a spin, \\"You'll be \\"Sailin' Round The Room\\" for sure and headin' for \\"The Great Divide\\". Trust me.

B003VXNZIC|5.0|These 12 tracks from the 2008/2009 world tour were selected for their special qualities as explained by producer Ed Sanders in the sleeve notes. They represent a blend of the familiar - refreshed and rejuvenated by innovative arrangements - and the obscure. The \\"greatest hits\\" are Bird On The Wire, Suzanne, Famous Blue Raincoat, Hallelujah, The Partisan and Chelsea Hotel.<br /><br />The highlights, however, are three lesser known songs, i.e. Heart With No Companion, Lover Lover Lover and Closing Time. Lover Lover Lover's lilting rhythms transform the song far away from the harsh 1973 studio version on [[ASIN:B000024CRD New Skin for the Old Ceremony]] whilst the slightly amended lyrics and jazzy treatment give Bird On The Wire a whole different feel.<br /><br />From Gothenburg in Sweden, there's an austere, acoustic rendition of Avalanche from [[ASIN:B000NOKA1W Songs Of Love And Hate]]. The buoyantly performed Heart With No Companion in Oberhausen, Germany, raises gooseflesh with the lines \\"through the days of shame that coming, through the nights of wild distress\\". The only outdoor performance is of Hallelujah at a festival in California and the album concludes with a vibrant version of Closing Time in London, Ontario.<br /><br />No tracks from Dear Heather, I'm Your Man, Recent Songs, or [[ASIN:B0012GMVY4 Death of a Ladies' Man]] are included; live versions of songs from the last two are available on [[ASIN:B000059T3N 1979 Field Commander Cohen]] which was recorded in the UK in 1979 and released in 2000. Cohen's first live album, [[ASIN:B000007VW5 Live Songs]] (1974) is also highly recommended for its rare tracks like Queen Victoria and Please Don't Pass Me By.
0784011710|5.0|\\"Sophie's Chpoce\\" is the result of intense collaboration, of course. William Styron was an American treasure-in a league with Mark Twain- Kevin Klein's perforance, Alan Pakula's direction, Peter McNichols introduction would all stand out as history making were it not for the most amazing performance given on stage or screen by any actor in history.The above mentioned work is shadowed by the finest performance in history.<br /><br />And that honor goes to Meryl Streep who was pregnant with her first child when she made this film. The now famous \\"Choice\\" scene was done in one take. Streeps flawless German (delivered with a slight Polish accent) slowed nothing. Streep herself said that it was not a scene that one had to read more than once and it was very expensive to do; just as it is not a scene that is easily watched more than once,no matter how it compells you. Imagine acting it with a baby growing inside of you.<br /><br />That is the scene that is shown so often in classrooms, talk shows and is, without doubt, the scene that replaces Orpon Wells lips whisper \\"Rosebud.\\" Still, Streeps performance (that won her an Oscar just two years after wining an Oscar for \\"Kramer vs Kramer\\")is honest, liquid, cryptic and brilliant from the moment we first see her, sobbing on the steps at the Pink Palace, to the last moment we see her-the image forever capttured on the cover of the DVD Box and the paerback novel;Kevin Kline's lips gently on her cheek.<br /><br />Streep fought for this role, as it was a certainty to the producers that only an Eastern European unknown could make this happen. Not many of Styron's novels have made it to film because of the complexity of his characters and all of the internal struggle and conflict. How can an actor reproduce the emotions of one who is completely drowning in memory?<br /><br />No one knows, because Streep- the ultimate soccer Mom- is very modest about it. She tends to let her work speak for itself; she doesn't have one or three different techniques that she clings to, despite her Masdters Degree from the Yale School of Drama (Where she poerformed in the premier production of Sondheim's \\"The Frogs\\".) She speaks only of honesty.<br /><br />This DVD costs a little more than it would to rent it. As a result, every home in America should own a copy. Every acting student should study the performances; every directing and editing student whould look at the ways in which camera angles manipulate the strange to make it beautiful and how the horror is captured with taste rather than with violence. Like Demme did with \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" our own imagination makes this film far more powerful than Carpenter does by showing us every detail in \\"Halloween\\"' Or speilberg with \\"Childler's List.\\"<br /><br />Streep's command of languages (She speaks three or four fluently in this film, the sloppiest being English)and dialect is rare. Many many actors have played roles in which they had to utilize a dialect, but the acting always suffers. Not in the case of Meryl Streep.<br /><br />In fact, when she won the Oscar and gave her brief thank you, her cheeks flushed pink with humility, her belly bulging in her 36th week of pregnancy, I was shocked to hear a Connecticut non-accent come out of her mouth.<br /><br />So you see, the film is one thing, but you must see this because Meryl streep has given us the most remarkable performance ever before.

B000026ALX|4.0|Death Of A Ladies Man is an album of great depth and striking songs although some may sound harsh to sensitive souls attuned to the singer-songwriter style of the 1970s. As for the complaints about Phil Spector's production, the sound is not that far removed from certain tracks on Cohen's 1974 album [[ASIN:B0012GMZKE New Skin for the Old Ceremony]], for example Is This What You Wanted? and Lover Lover Lover Come Back To Me that have the same raw vocals & heavy rock instrumentation as opposed to the acoustic simplicity & gentle vocals usually associated with his music.<br /><br />So there definitely was a precedent for Leonard the Rocker. His own aversion to the album - he completely ignored it in compiling [[ASIN:B00006RYF8 The Essential Leonard Cohen]] - probably has more to do with unpleasant memories relating to the recording process, which apparently was quite harrowing, than with the actual music. There is simply nothing wrong with the melodies or the lyrics; the arrangements and the vocals are a matter of taste.<br /><br />On tracks like the plodding drum-dominated Iodine, Memories with its complex arrangement and impressive saxophones & the thunderously pounding Don't Go Home his voice strains a bit against Spector's production (quite appropriately echoing the bitter sentiment of the songs), but the tuneful & twirling True Love Leaves No Traces is gentle and tender (one of his best songs) with stirring female vocals by Renee Blackley who contributes same on Iodine and Memories.<br /><br />The lyrics are sheer poetry, as in \\"True loves leaves no traces/If you and I are one/It's lost in our embraces/Like stars against the sun\\" and in the acerbic Paper-Thin Hotel: \\"It's written on the walls of this hotel/You go to heaven once you've been to hell/A heavy burden lifted from my soul/I heard that love was out of my control.\\" The harshest element in Iodine is the lyrics, not the drums or the overall sound which is rendered highly atmospheric by the other-worldly backing vocals.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002C2E Bob Dylan]] and [[ASIN:0061139750 Alan Ginsberg]] are credited with vocals on Don't Go Home ... a truly impressive tour de force with a rolling rhythm and vibrant percussive patterns. It is indeed an out and out rock song with powerful guitars, driving rhythms, lovely piano rolls and apparent anger which really turns out to be humor in the end. With more bombast, [[ASIN:B000056VJ7 Meat Loaf]] could record a rock-operatic cover and surpass his success with Bat out of Hell.<br /><br />Besides True Love Leaves No Traces, the other immediately appealing songs are the elegantly arranged I Left A Woman Waiting where Leonard's voice hovers between speaking and singing the sensual lyrics & the tuneful and buoyant Fingerprints. This fiddle feast with its lilting, propulsive beat must be one of the most catchy country songs of all time. The closest Cohen came to country again was the track The Captain on the 1984 album [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]].<br /><br />The weighty title track Death of a Ladies' Man is [[ASIN:B00005OAJR gravitas]] at its gravest; the arrangement is majestic with outstanding doom-laden choral vocals that advance and recede, occasionally allowing a single female vocal to briefly frame his voice. And it includes segments where a single instrument or hypnotic instrumental pattern comes to the fore.<br /><br />With its overall drone-like ambience it is a masterpiece so dark that one may consider it an early exploration - albeit accidental - of the direction the legendary band Swans pursued on their album [[ASIN:B000060OHW The Great Annihilator]] in the 1990s. It would have been perfect for Velvet Underground chanteuse Nico as it calls to mind Das Lied der Deutschen on her 1974 album [[ASIN:B000001E2U The End]].<br /><br />The sleeve notes credit \\"Spector & Cohen\\" as composers of each and every track with no further information as to lyrics or music. Spector was responsible for all vocal arrangements and for rhythm arrangements on six tracks. The two exceptions are I Left A Woman Waiting & Iodine where Nino Tempo takes the credit. Phil definitely set out to recreate his famous wall of sound with seventeen backing vocalists and an array of instruments that includes guitars, drums, keyboards, synth, bass, percussion, fiddle, sax, flute, trombone, trumpet, organ and vibes.<br /><br />Proof of the quality of these compositions can be found on the excellent tribute album [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]] where True Love Leaves No Traces is given a breezy 1970s pop treatment by Dead Famous People & Don't Go Home With Your Hard ... is covered well enough by David McComb & Adam Peters. I loved Death of a Ladies' Man when it was released in 1978 and I appreciate it even more now. Like everybody else, Cohen is allowed to shout sometimes. If he doesn't like the production, nothing stops him from re-recording these great songs.eft A Woman Waiting & Iodine where Nino Tempo takes the credit.

B004G6009U|5.0|When I saw the first advertisement for this film, I was a bit turned off because it looked like one of those twisted alternate fairy tale movies; where something goes wrong that's totally unexpected and hilarity (or just plain wrongness) ensues.  The title change was a bit of a turnoff for me at first too.  But as I did some research on the film and started seeing the previews, I started to think that maybe I was wrong.  I also came to forgive the title change because I realized that judging a film by its title is just like judging a book by its cover.  And because I found out that they did that because they wanted a title that represented both main characters, not just the female lead.  I was also pleased to find that the company was now trying to market more towards boys; which as a man, I appreciate.  After all, the princesses have been getting all the attention for years.  Let the heroes have some!    Right, so anyhue...    Not only did the movie have some real catchy songs, memorable characters, and parts that were absolutely hilarious; but despite a few changes, the movie's basic plot remained mostly true to the original story.  I don't want to spoil any of it though.  If there was one thing I didn't like, it was seeing the short old guy traipsing around in his underwear.  Although there was a scene later on where he made me laugh.      Another great thing about this movie is that in most CGI films there are 2 things you don't see being animated since it apparently takes a lot of work: hair and bare feet.  But Disney stepped up to the challenge and did an excellent job animating both of those things.  You never even see characters doing so much as combing their hair in most CGI movies, whereas Rapunzel's hair... well, need I say more?  CGI movie characters also have shoes on all the time and in the extremely rare cases when they don't, you don't see much of their feet (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).  Rapunzel on the other hand, is always barefoot inthe movie and her feet are almost always visible.  Just a little side note: Quentin Tarintino apparently said that Tangled was one of his favorite films of all time.  Hmm... I wonder why that is.  Anyway, all that just goes to show what a better job Disney does when it comes to animation.    In conclusion, Tangled has turned out to become an outstanding movie; which I can't wait to own on DVD.  Oh, but that brings me to one more tiny little thing I didn't like about the movie: it was released in theaters in November, so it couldn't be released on DVD in time for Christmas.
1601252463|5.0|The Advanced Players Guide gives you new ideas for the original classes, making each a new and exciting adventure to create. Not only that, there are six new classes that do not rub elbows with existing classes, but instead, compliment them. The introduction of \\"traits\\" for player-characters is a welcome sight (i have already done something similar in my games) and promotes creativity down to the core of every character. There is a plethora of things to delve into to from new equipment lists, magic items, and so on. I have been really impressed with Paizo, this book marks pace with the rest of their awesome products.
B003ASLJMW|4.0|For a taste of the Cold War at its height (and near its conclusion), Firefox is a great blast from the past.  They tried hard in the film to highlight all sorts of elements of the Soviet apparatus, including dissident scientists, Jews who were downtrodden and oppressed by the system, bureaucrats mindlessly following orders, the vastness of the country, and the intransigence of the pre-Gorbachev leadership.  The Soviet leader portrayed here is a kind of Breshnev-meets-Andropov figure, who is hoping for a technological leap above the Western powers.  This film also taps into the then-prevalent Western fears that the Soviets would make some kind of technological breakthrough that would tip the balance of power inexorably in their favour; of course, time would reveal that they were much more worried about our technological and economic advances with which they could never really compete.  But that's too complex for a film like this, which is already a spy-thriller, chase, and military adventure film rolled into one.  It succeeds for the most part on these levels - Clint Eastwood plays the still-having-flashbacks pilot drafted into the mission of stealing the new MIG-31, a plane so technologically advanced it can operate on mental commands, but limited enough that it would only recognise them in Russian (Eastwood played a pilot fluent in Russian).<br /><br />In a somewhat strange role, Nigel Hawthorne (one of my all-time favourite actors) played the key Russian scientist, reluctantly but effectively developing the technology, but just as effectively determined to help it be stolen.  Many of the other actors are British, including those playing Russians and those playing Americans.  All are reasonably effective, though there are few stellar performances here.<br /><br />The special effects are very good - John Dykstra of Star Wars fame produced many of the elements in this.  Scenes of flying in the cockpit and the dogfights between the planes are very effective; they were more dramatic, in all honesty, before Top Gun came along, but they remain rather good even in comparison.<br /><br />In all, this is an interesting film, a bit overlooked now because time has moved on past the subject matter.  It is one of the earlier films produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who has gone on to much bigger and grander projects, but one can see his touch here., in all honesty, before Top Gun came along, but they remain rather good even in comparison.

Too much resistance.<br />The balls tend to get stuck in the spiral track about halfway down where one piece of track connects to another.

Intend on selling it because we get no use from it.
0553212419|5.0|The first Sherlock Holmes book I ever read was given to me as a gift for my thirteenth birthday. It was a collection of the short stories, with a wonderful leather trim and gold leafing, and I thought it was fantastic. I read the first story, and was instantly hooked. Within a few days, I was disappointed with my wonderful new book because it was incomplete. I had devoured all of the selected stories, and was ready for more.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, I purchased what purported to be the 'only complete Sherlock Holmes available', compiled by Christopher Morley (and it may have been at the time of its publication). This became my favourite book. However, I have continued to collect editions of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and this is one of those collections. It does contain all the short stories and all the novels, if you get both volumes (this is volume 1). It does not have illustrations or other commentary, and the print (in a double-column format) is rather small, but it is nonetheless a useful text for those who don't want to have a heavier book in their hands.<br /><br />The original stories, which appeared in The Strand magazine, were illustrated, by the great illustrator Sidney Paget.<br /><br />From the beginning introduction of Holmes and Watson to Holmes' gentle retirement to beekeepping on the southern coast of England, this book contains all the essential stories (none of the apocryphal, anecdotal, or tribute-written pieces are contained here). Holmes was often thought to be a real person, and Sherlockians the world over still search for 'evidence' to prove that he was. During his 'lifetime', the post office for the Baker Street area regularly received mail addressed to Holmes or Watson at 221B Baker Street. While such an address does not (and did not during the late Victorian era) exist, there is a business on the site that would be 221B, and they have dedicated a desk to Holmes, and strive to answer mail received in the great detective's name.<br /><br />Perhaps the two elements that made Holmes and Watson the world-renowned figures that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.<br /><br />Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world. It is still recommended even when it is not required.<br /><br />Holmes permeates other literature and venues as well.

Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world. It is still recommended even when it is not required.

B004FOJZXU|4.0|If you are a fan of the movie, this is a must buy. It contains everything as pictured. The price is also quite reasonable, as some of the other sellers of this item are charging way more. Also, the fact that my order showed up about two weeks before I was told it would was a pleasant surprise.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.  I recommend a re-read of this charming book!!
B003ZEY0F4|5.0|I have just recieved the scream trilogy on blu ray, and I must say, they look like new movies!  If people are tired of waiting for the U.S. release of the blu ray, this set is great.  I have read other reviews and the only complaint people have is of the packaging, but there is a solution.  The get scream 2 and 3 out of the packaging, there are two prongs at the bottom of scream 2, just push them down and break them, and the movie comes right out.  There are two prongs at the bottom of scream 3 also, and you can do the same with that movie.  There are no special features, but I have enough special features from the regular dvd editions of the movies, so that doesn't bother me.  So, I recommend that if you are a scream fan, then you must buy this set.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|When \\"Almost Famous\\" first came out on DVD, I couldn't get enough of it, particularly when played with the DTS soundtrack. Then, when the extended \\"Untitled, Bootleg Cut\\" came out, with both the theatrical version and extended version of the movie, I bought it. However, the DTS soundtrack that accompanied the theatrical version of \\"Almost Famous\\" was not included on the extended version.    Now, I have the best of both worlds: An absolutely gorgeous Blu-ray version of the extended \\"Almost Famous\\" movie with a terrific English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Apparently, Paramount has given an exclusive initial distribution deal for the Blu-ray version of the \\"Bootleg Cut\\" to a large retail chain store. I have posted a cover picture that shows where to buy this disk for, as of this writing, half the list price.    I have been reading reviews of the previous extended version of \\"Almost Famous\\" with great interest. It seems that some people who hated the original theatrical version of the movie thought that the extended director's edition might appeal to them. It didn't. This reminds me of the old joke that goes, \\"The food at this restaurant is terrible -- and such small portions!\\"

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is so much more than I anticipated - it feels like Dr. Alice Howland is a real person, not a character in a novel.  I have recommended it to several friends who are dealing with Alzheimer's patients, including one with Early Onset Alzheimer's.  It said to me \\"Just because I have this condition, I am still the person I always was, just trapped by my brain.\\"  Alice wants to maintain as much normalcy in her life as she is able, WHILE she is able.  She knows there will come a time when she will not know her children or her husband or her colleagues, and is collecting memories and sharing love while she still can.  Highly recommended.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. The only reason why I found out about Janelle is because I was looking at pictures from the Grammy's and didn't know who she was. Saw the video for Tightrope and was amazed. Janelle is a combo of 60s MoTown, Bowie, Floyd, Hendrix guitar solos, 80s new wave, and all with a modern twist. Absolutely brilliant and would recommend this album to anyone.

4770031246|5.0|This book covers everything a westerner needs to know to start making bentos.  Makiko offers advice on what to keep on hand as well as where to get it along with possible substitutions.  Each set of recipes includes variations along with a timeline describing how best arrange your food-making (what can be made the night before, what items to prepare while something else is simmering, etc.) and, of course, plenty of attractive and informative pictures.  Half of the book is devoted to more traditional Japanese lunches and the other half to Western ones with bento flair (cookie-cutter sandwiches, for instance).  The recipes within are all simple to prepare, much less daunting than other bento books.  Even more than the recipes, it's the advice given and the techniques taught in this book that are the best part(s).  Overall a great help for anyone looking to make some healthy, attractive lunches.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|I have always loved, loved, loved Hitch movies. So i jumped almost out of my computer chair when i saw that my fav North by Northwest was now in blu ray format. I have the dvd, but you just can not compare the two as far as the picture quality goes. Awesome picture quality, great movie. Hope to see more of my favorite Hitchcock movies make it to blu ray!
0670022411|3.0|I loved this story.  I loved the characters in this story.  All through the book I was thinking of which friends I would recommend it to so that we could discuss it.  Then, about 40 pages from the end, with great disappointment, I realized there was no way she was going to wrap up this complex story in 40 pages.  It was like the ribbon-wrapped baby in the story, there were so many strands to the story but she only tied up one.  The rest are all still waving in the wind and I guessed it would take at least 2 more books to wrap up the story and then maybe another book or so for back story on the other family members. I felt ripped off.  She could have ended this story leaving some unanswered questions for the next book but she did not end the story or even this particular adventure in the story.  I will tell my friends not to get this book until the rest of the books are published so they can read them all at once.  I felt that the author had violated my trust.  This book should stand on its own without requiring another book to complete it.  The second and third books should provide more information on the characters or new adventures but not be necessary to understanding the first book.  A great story without an ending only gets a 3 from me.
031603438X|3.0|After a lifelong fascination with this man since 12 (I'm now 50)...the most archetypal rock star/artist/bad ass that either made the limelight...I was waiting for insights into his personality and mystique that just never came, or at best came in dribs and drabs, far and few between.    While some of it is understandable in all their cases, his petty slagging of Jagger, Jones, Wyman, Taylor, and even John Lennon gets embarassingly frequent and tiresome...almost as much as the endless meandering about drugs and his very self promoted capacity to ingest them in copious quantities. And his constant bantering about how tough he is yells out insecurity about...something...or at least a very twisted, arrested development attempt at recapturing something he genuinely used to be (see 'Gimme Shelter', or the first page of Roy Carr's \\"An Illustrated Record\\".     You were very cool Keith...the real article...and you've earned those stripes, but give the pining for resurrecting your glory days image a rest. It's undignified.    Bottom line? He may \\"remember everything\\", but the natural devil may care street punk cool that once unconsciously defined him was gone the moment he became aware of and started admiring it himself!    I still love him though! His life is unquestionably of mythical proportions...bigger than the man himself...to an extent he can't even get his drug damaged mind around. And musically, which is all he ever claimed to love or be good at, he's the best and...as much as 'You Got the Silver' will remain my favourite Keith track...I think he gets better and better (listen closely to 'Losing My Touch' from 40 Licks), like all the elderly blues artists he worshiped as a teenager and spent his whole life emulating. The so called critics just don't get that...to busy sterilizing their musical sensibilities with all the computer generated crap and sixties rip offs masquerading today as 'great music'.    You got there there Keith, just like Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters did by the time you were starting out! Don't listen to the naysayers...'How Can (you) Stop'?
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie about a real American hero.  We enjoyed the movie as uplifting entertainment that had powerful messages about people, animals and doing the right thing.  I especially loved her line \\"Nature is cruel, we don't have to be\\"  She has done more to make animals lives more humane, than virtually anyone...  Buy the movie, especially for those who have a distorted view of man's responsibility to animals.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I wasn't expecting this item to arrive as quickly as it did. Very impressed. All discs work perfect. Made a great gift!
B000001GQP|3.0|This performance is wonderful, but it is hard to believe how bad the recording quality is -- ranges from virtually inaudible to mind-blastingly loud.  I am constantly turning up the volume, only to have to jump up in fright to turn down the volume, followed once again by prolonged minutes of the \\"inaudible.\\"  I finally decided I cannot ever relax and enjoy this profound peformance -- I will sadly retire it and purchase some other recording.
B001H9JBW6|3.0|I'm a huge fan of British drama, science fiction and Benedict Cumberbatch so I though I would really enjoy this. However, the plot was dragged on and I never really came to care for any of the characters. This could have been a really cool mini-series but was just cast poorly.
0385341679|5.0|I had two prerequisites for this book before I started reading it. 1)Questions that have been building up for the last 4 books get answered; and 2)Barrons and Mac ultimately end up together.    Both happen. Some might consider that a spoiler, so sorry. But to me, going into this book knowing those two things made it a much better read. I could relax and enjoy the entire story because I knew those two things were going to happen. Also, in reading a lot of the other reviews on here I've noticed that a lot of people are irritated because we \\"don't really find out what Barrons is.\\" Uuumm. . . Did you people read the same book as I did? Because I feel pretty comfortable with the amount we now know about him. The only thing not disclosed to us is his original origin and an actual name for what he is. But who cares? A label is a label is a label. . . And I'm sure we can all agree that Barrons is not a man you can stick a label on.    Also, people have complained about how much introspection Mac has in this book. Again. . . Have you people not been reading the same series as I have?? Yes, there is a lot of introspection in this book. Just like in the 4 books that came before it. If there is slightly MORE of it in this one than there was in the others? Well duh. It's about twice as long as the other books!    I loved this book. People and things that you thought were the \\"big bad\\" turn out to be not so tough and people and things that your thoughts never wavered on turn out to be pretty big and pretty bad. Mac's thoughts and theories are constantly adapting when things change and she finds out more and more. It really keeps you on your toes and makes your form your own opinions before it spills the actual beans on the whole situation.    There is a breif appearance by one of my favorite KMM characters EVER! An appearance I've been waiting for pretty much this entire series. And NO, it's not the Keltars! And her writing style is beautiful and easy to read, as always. All in all, a good read.
0307276902|4.0|Have read this book a few times - most notably before the imfamous Oprah interview.     Ignoring whether it is or isnt fiction, which to be honest, isnt that important after all - it is a good read. Its a good story, its well written and its engaging.     I would genuinely recommend this book - the deadpan language adds colour, the subject matter is engrossing and Frey has a knack of dragging you in and wishing him well, cheering him on against adversity.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|The best of the Beatles lives in the best of DCFC.  I would add, however, DCFC takes some of its chord progressions, melodies and harmonies to a level the Lads did not reach as a group -- in particular songs, here and there, yes.  Blackbird, for example.
B002UD56I6|4.0|I have never thought of myself as a Michael Jackson fan and watched this movie with built in reservations about even liking it. The truth of the matter is I consider myself a dedicated fan of classical music and doubted that there would be anything in this movie that would get me interested.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />\\"This is It\\" is a truly remarkable account of a dedicated professional performer who knew his art to perfection; although I was unfamiliar with his music, his professional competence in what he was doing shows through very clearly. I found myself becoming enthusiastic about his vision for the production and certainly admired his control of the various forces that would be required to bring it to fruition.<br /><br />Another big plus was the level of professionalism demonstrated by those people he had gathered around him to fulfill this vision. It is indeed tragic that the only result of all of the huge effort put in by all of them was a single movie. It is true that some of the artists featured have used this as a springboard for their own careers, Jackson's lead guitarist; Orianthi Panagaris immediately comes to mind for example. It is hoped that others may also benefit from the gigantic effort that was put into the preparations for the stage presentations.<br /><br />I can recommend this film not only for Michael Jackson fans, but for anyone who has a sincere regard for professionalism, especially in the field of performance. This movie is a showcase of professionalism and is worthy of appreciation on that level alone.
B003UESJEM|4.0|This is a good (not great, unfortunately) movie with some really great work being done by the A-list cast it employs.  Some have faulted the ending, but the end shows the get-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps mentality that America is in short supply of right now, yet we all know America can do oh-so-well.    Kudos to the entire cast, it's just too bad the script fails you towards the end.
B001VNB54A|4.0|This was a gift from the same person who had given us \\"Band of Brothers\\" which we have watched many, many times. Having had the experience with that series we approached this one with a certain set of expectations.<br /><br />First off \\"The Pacific\\" in Blu-ray is superior in both the video and audio to \\"Band of Brothers,\\" which we have on DVD; I have not seen the Blu-ray version which may balance things out in that department. One of the things we came to appreciate in the Brothers series was the opportunity to get better acquainted with the characters before the action starts. \\"The Pacific\\" pretty much hits the ground running and one has to scrap around a little more to try and develop a feeling for this set of characters; before the series is over feelings of sympathy and concern will likely have developed for some of them.<br /><br />Having said that the Pacific series moves along at a fast pace and carries one on through the key battles that helped us win the war. One aspect of this movie that set it apart from Brothers was its focus on the horrors and brutality of war and its impact on the Marines who had to fight the Pacific war and the civilian population caught up in the struggle.<br /><br />The mind-numbing stresses provoked by battle produced different results on the different Marines who were faced with the challenges of warfare; the civilians who were also victims of the war suffered unspeakable horrors as warfare waged around them. The common denominator of our shared humanity evoked mixed emotions of sympathy, horror, fear, and dread as the varied casualties of war emerged.<br /><br />The atomic bomb is casually mentioned near the end of Disc 9 with a reference to one bomb that destroyed a city.<br /><br />Also, unlike Brothers, the last disc focuses on the challenges and difficulties faced by veterans as they returned to civilian life after the war; some to sympathetic receptions and some to stony indifference and all levels in between. I suspect it is nearly impossible for those of us who never had to face that sort of challenge to imagine the difficulties in readjusting one's thinking to civilian life.<br /><br />Having lived through the Second World War as a child I vividly remember the fear and loathing that was generated in the minds of Americans at the mention of the Germans and the Japs! The media supported the war effort and no punches were pulled when it came to describing the atrocities being committed by both the Germans and the Japs; fortunately the very worst parts either had not been revealed or were generally unknown.<br /><br />From what I have read and seen it appears there was initially a certain glamour attributed to fighting as a soldier in WW I. Since WW II the glamour of warfare is absent, and in its place is the brutality and horror of combat. This series carries on that tradition with effective conviction. The series has a TV MA rating which means for Mature Audiences only, the same as an R rating for movies; this gives you a clue as to the levels of deadly combat depicted.<br /><br />It is a memorable series, however.never had to face that sort of challenge to imagine the difficulties in readjusting one's thinking to civilian life.

0060936223|5.0|I actually did really enjoy this book, and that's saying quite a lot from a voracious reader who generally avoids non-fiction and most especially biographies and autobiographies!  To be even more honest?  I LOVE THIS BOOK!  (I followed up my reading with internet search of music, photos and interviews...quite enjoyable and informative, but I definitely would suggest that other readers feeling so inclined save \\"more about it\\" until after reading the book; my opinion is that knowing more beforehand might have ruined the \\"magic\\" and personal response for me.)

0439023513|4.0|This was the third and final installment of the popular Hunger Games series.  While much darker than its two predecessors, I think the way the author wrapped up the series worked.  She knew when it was time for the series to be over.  At times I thought it could have been done a little differently but after I finished it, I was pleased enough at the ending.  I was happy with who ended up remaining in her life as I was pulling for him all along.  However, I did mourn the loss of a key character introduced in the second book and I truly wish this didn't have to happen.  I can't comment on who it was here since I don't want to give any spoilers.  But then again, this is what a good author does - they make you feel real emotions for people who do not exist.<br /><br />I really recommend this series.  The imagination was superb.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I don't get it with these nitpicky reviews. A guy is called colonel instead of sir? Who cares? This is a film about what NOT to do in Iraq. It's depicting a main character who's a decent man, but also flawed and reckless. It's a very interesting character study. As for realism, most of the plotholes more come from characters doing illogical things than doing things that aren't possible. Guess what? Characters making dumb decisions create CONFLICT. Movies need conflict.    All of the performances are excellent, especially Jeremy Renner, but Anthony Mackie was also snubbed at the oscars for a nomination. This movie also benefits from not having any stupid political messages that some war films try to ram down your throat. It's a piece of storytelling, not a political statement, and people it's not a documentary either. You gotta sometimes sacrifice facts for the sake of making an entertaining movie. Still it's good. No clear cut message. Not pro-war. Not anti-war. Just a story about a guy who likes a bit of adrenaline. The film also succeeds in having lots of very suspenseful scenes. My heart was pounding a lot.    At the very least, this film succeeds in giving civilians awareness to the fact that EOD is a difficult, dangerous, and stressful job. I do know people in the military who have enjoyed this. Sometimes, you gotta think about the movie as art and simply how it functions as a piece of filmmaking. Braveheart wasn't accurate either, but lots of people love that one.    Not all films deserve the best picture oscar. This one did. In my personal opinion, the best war film since Saving Pvt. Ryan.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I initially bought these headphones to play at night so I wouldn't wake up my family with loud gun shots and bombs from CoD. So I researched headsets that were under 100 for ps3s. This one seemed to stand out the most because they were a decent price and were made by TURTLE BEACH.     Unfortunately I am disappointed with the product.    Pros:  1) Nice bass output and bass is adjustable  2) decent sound quality  3) good price    Cons:  1) Feels very cheap (made of light plastic and materials seem inadequate for a turtle beach)  2) Fits too tight on my head (had to stretch them out carefully to make sure they didn't break)  3) hurt my ears (cups are too small and the fit doesn't feel right    Overall I'd say they are not worth the 60 something dollars that they are listed for.     *not a good product for the money  *would not recommend this to a friend or anyone
B001EN71DG|5.0|In the 6th grade, we read a novelization of The Empire Strikes Back(1980) at school. Afterwards, we were treated to the movie on VHS. I watched the Star Wars trilogy many times on VHS and my siblings and I saw the 1997 re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition. This DVD set is worth the money and it deserves space in your DVD collection. Everything from Starcrash(1978) to Battle Beyond the Stars(1979) to the original Battlestar Galactica(1978) have tried to emulate it.<br /><br />Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope(1977): Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Han Solo try to rescue kidnapped Princess Leia. They must also destroy the Death Star(a diabolical weapon that can destroy planets).<br /><br />Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back(1980): The Rebels are on the run from Imperial troops. Luke Skywalker meets Jedi Master Yoda for the first time.<br /><br />Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi(1983). Han Solo is frozen in carbonite and sold to Jabba the Hut. Luke and Leia must travel to Tatooine to rescue him. The Rebels still struggle to free the galaxy from the Galactic Empire.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The sweeper came in bubble wrap and looked like it had been drop kicked over Niagara Falls, but when I extricated it out of its mangled packaging and put it together, everything worked as advertised.  I made sure the battery was charged of 8 (but not more than 12) hours and started sweeping.  Have had it for a week and it is still on it's first charge.  It is not for heavy cleaning, but excellent for light pick up--and I love the easy to use emptying tray feature which allows you to dump debris directly into the trash can without removing the dustbin.  Exactly what I was hoping for when I made the purchase.
B001EN71DQ|3.0|I remember how hyped people were to see Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 1999. Students in my class constantly talked about the fact it was coming out! Star Wars fans lined up in front of movie theaters months in advance to see it. I must really be slow-witted. It took me a month to realize that some people considered it a failure. An episode of The Simpsons from a few years ago satirized the event and you can hear people on You Tube ranting about it. Jar Jar Binks is a Star Wars character who has been rejected by fans. Star Wars Episode I received bad reviews, but it still made a profit at the box office. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones(2002) and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith(2005) were released in subsequent years. They are visually stunning and the action scenes are good, but they're a mess...plot and character wise!   If you hate the Star Wars prequels, consider them product. They fill six or seven hours of space!     Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace(1999): Jedi Knights Qui Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson) and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) aid young Queen Amidala after the greedy Trade Federation has conquered her planet. Along the way, they meet Jar Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker.     Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones(2002): Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker conduct an investigation after assassins try to kill Senator Amidala. The two stumble upon a conspiracy. Anakin Skywalker starts to drift toward the Dark Side of the Force. Christopher Lee is quite good as Count Dooku.     Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith(2005): The Jedi Knights hunt for separatist leader General Grievous. Anakin Skywalker ends up joining the Dark Side of the Force and becoming Darth Vader. The film features Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader fighting on a lava-covered planet.     The adventure \\"continues\\" in Star Wars The Clone Wars(2008-)!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love this workout, I have been doing it for one week and can already see results. It is going to take a long time for me to work my way up to level 3 and that is a good thing. The introduction is tiresome, the way I got around this is to stop the video before it reaches the end - while Jillian is talking after the cooldown.  My player will start the dvd where it last stopped.  The next time I want to play the dvd, it starts at the end and I hit the menu button and that brings me back to the top of the workout without having to watch the intro.
B002N57KG2|5.0|I love this film. I first saw it as a kid and I'm familiar with most of the cast, so that'll at least partly explain my attraction to it.<br /><br />Highlights here for me...<br />- Intro with Lamborghini police chase in desert.<br />- Real camels in desert intro scene with the sheik.<br />- Any scene with Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, or Jamie Farr, with their corresponding theme music.<br />- Jackie Chan's 1st intro to mainstream America, not including his earlier Big Brawl.<br />- A great cast of stars & neat cars, including a red Ferrari, a silver Aston Martin, and a white Rolls Royce.<br /><br />Kids today may actually recognize Jackie Chan & Terry Bradshaw before they recognize anybody else. Roger Moore playing Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a guy who thinks he's Roger Moore, is fantastic to me. He along with his gadget-filled Aston Martin & near James Bond music is almost single-handedly the reason I prefer this 1st film to the sequel. In this 1st movie we also see a lot of the great Lamborghini, whereas in the sequel, the Lamborghini is ditched near the beginning due to a breakdown.<br /><br />I actually appreciate the humor in this. Jamie Farr as the sheik here is impressively politically incorrect, as is much of the film, but in a mainly tame way. I re-watch this a lot, with my favorite sections being the beginning to Bert Convy riding a motorcycle out of an airplane over Arizona, and then from when Jackie first enters the desert to the end of the film. These beginning & end sequences simply have the most replay value for me.<br /><br />In the audio commentary, the directer & producer incorrectly state that this is Jackie Chan's 1st American film. The producer later clarifies this, saying it's Jackie's 1st exposure to a broad, American audience. This is mainly true. Jackie's 1st American film was actually the Big Brawl, which was released a year earlier, in 1980. Because Cannonball Run was a huge hit, and the Big Brawl was a huge flop, it's logical that Jackie's 1st widespread introduction to America would be considered Cannonball Run. It actually was my introduction to Jackie Chan, although I didn't become fanatical about him & his movies until I rediscovered him in the mid-90's.<br /><br />- Product tie-ins... many brand-names are mentioned or seen here. A partial list: 7-11; Budweiser; Camel; Coca-Cola; Dr. Pepper; GMC Trucks; Goodyear; Hawaiian Tropic & the Hawaiian Tropic Girls; and NASCAR; not to mention the various main auto makers.

0316019984|5.0|I bought this book for two of my nephews (aged 3 and 4) and they loved them!!! My brothers (their dads) loved them too. The pop ups are very detailed. It goes into quite a bit of detail about the characters back story & the villains in the characters' lives. I highly recommend it. I bought myself one too...
B004AHNIGM|5.0|The chances of an ABB album of new material coming any time soon, if ever, seems unlikely, given the sparse output in the last decade. So, in the meantime, here's this solo album from Gregg. While not terribly similar to an ABB project, it is a worthy musical experience for any fan of the genre and a fine accomplishment in it's own right. Gregg's voice is in fantastic shape, especially considering his overall health and (let's face it)advancing age. Always a fine vocalist that uses his range and phrasing with amazing taste, along with solid pitch, he has always been a favorite of mine. So,hearing his voice, strong and passionate and right up front, is worth the listen alone. Add a nice selection of less explored blues standards played by first rate musicians makes this the real deal. The one original composition sounds great here and also brings a bit of the signature ABB style to the proccedings. Everone seems engaged, and while the atmosphere is professional and respectful, there is a sense of feeling and integrity, and downright fun, throughout. Some have criticised the T-Bone Burnette production of several late career efforts lately, none are all that similar and each seems to fit the artist, rather than the other way around. So, get it, enjoy it and appreciate the fact that we have music of this timeless quality still being made today.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|you know what . it was great! i love renesmee (nessie).i love her gift and love edward. im a die hard twifan.
0981951244|4.0|Before reading the Compound Effect I was looking to make some changes to help attain more success.  What I found in this book is fantastic step by step instructions to do just that.  The book also has you look deep within yourself, and asks you questions that help you come up with your true goals.  It is that very thing which helps us all, if we really understand our 'why', the thing that drives us everyday, then we have no choice but to become successful.<br />  Great book, great incite, and great follow through.  I know you will get much out of it!
6304331851|5.0|A great musical score, be sure to listen closely to the lyrics, they carry the story as well as the actors and add a little humor. The Overature, Intermission and Exit music was a nice touch, but greatly edited down from the previous offerings. The movie is a little lengthy and toward the end a little dragged out, but if you can stay awake you will enjoy it.
1401309666|4.0|I found this book an enjoyable read due to its applicability to my own personal experiences and observations.  The basic idea of the book is that the trend for businesses is to offer more services and options to the individual.  While too many options can at times become overbearing for the customer, it is important to strike a balance between more is better and what is manageable.  The Long Tail explained in great detail the innovations of internet services and the trends of currently popular business practices.          The author, Chris Anderson, references numerous examples in his text.  These include the rise of iTunes, the popularity of Netflix, Google, and Amazon. Anderson discusses why certain products become hits and why others fall into the `tail' of popularity.  He also discusses how these internet based companies emerged to become to the emerging leaders of business.   I enjoyed Anderson's use of these examples as they are pertinent to the current times.  While the book was written several years prior, the issues and trends that he identifies are still applicable to the present.  The book identified observations that I made about the current trends of various business practices and explained them in great detail.     While I enjoyed the concepts of the book, after finishing it, I believe that I could have retained the same information in much fewer pages.  Similar to The Tipping Point, the book is a great resource as a collection of case studies and examples, but not so much as far on the instructional end.  The book is best used as a reference for the reader to figure out the applicability on their own.      I recommend this book for anyone with an interest in sales, marketing, and economics.  The book is an easy read with a wealth of great ideas.  It was written in an informal way that is easy for a casual pick-up read.  While the reader may grasp the concepts of the book early on and parts may seem repetitive, there is enough content to keep the reader engaged until the end.  Though the book is filled with case studies and business profiles, it is written on a personal level that lends itself able to draw in the reader.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|I had to review this movie, the show was my FAVORITE- a show about real women; albeit with inflated salaries and free time, who deal with relationship problems in a way I have never seen before or since. The show was not about sex or men bashing, plus I loved the shoes and fashion, and when they would go places in the show (like City Bakery) that I go to and love.    My husband informed me via email one day that they were filming SATC right here on Park Ave. My coworker and I rushed over, but we missed it, and instead found the crew for \\"Cashmere Mafia\\".    OK so the whole theme of the movie was forgiveness. While a nice idea for a show, it did not carry well through the movie, based on the girls personalities. What did they consult the Dalai Lama on this one? Miranda had to forgive Steve, Carrie had to forgive Big, Carrie had to forgive Miranda, Smith had to forgive Samantha and Charlotte had to forgive Big.    I CANNOT believe Steve cheated. Wow. If he can cheat, whose boyfriend or husband can't? Well, mine of course! He was always the good guy, the guy i rooted for through the entire series. The kind of guy you would be thrilled if your daughter brought home. Plus the reason for him cheating- how many couples who work full time and have children don't have dry spells at some point? I really did not like the therapist saying that she can't live her life not trusting him. Sure, she has to forgive him, but I think the \\"what if he does it again\\" feeling would not just go away. I am glad they ended up together, because I know he learned his lesson and also that Miranda knows that even though he may be flawed, she would be hard pressed to find another \\"Steve\\" in the city.    Carrie and Big. Wow. Most people hated the wedding scene but I thought it was so accurate. When she realized he wasn't coming and let the phone drop to the floor..my heart sank. He did it to her again. Bastard. And when she went outside and beat him with her bouquet...s*** who wouldn't have done that in her shoes? Even Charlotte was upset, which is rare to see. However, I think in real life he would have either called someone else's cell phone and asked Carrie to meet him outside, or sent Raul in to go get her. Bad writing.    When Carrie went to Mexico with the girls, she was so depressed, and not just for a day. She wouldn't get out of bed, wouldn't eat, didn't care that she was at one of the most beautiful places in the world with her very best friends. I have never seen a more accurate portrayal of depression. I would have thrown a glass at the waiter when he called me Mrs. Prescott.    It was not a good move for Samantha to leave Smith. Sure she missed her friends in NY and missed some of her independence, but where on earth would she find a 30 yr. old guy who stood with her while she had chemo? I thought it SO distasteful when everyone said she got fat. Besides a teeny tiny bit of flab on her tummy, where was the fat? They could have at least made this believable by putting her in a fat suit. I would kill to look like her. At MY age. That is not real NY women. Real NY women eat when they are depressed but they also gain weight- especially if they are 50!    Jennifer Hudson did a good (not great) job as Carrie's assistant. Loved the fact that Carrie finally had someone else to interact with, and someone of color, which was lacking in the show.    Steve and Big both messed up. But IMHO, if I were Miranda or Carrie I would have expected more. They should have got cards, emails and phone calls every day. Steve should have bought something nice for Miranda, and gave her access to his private email account to prove she could trust him. Ummm Big could have maybe tried the doorbell once or twice? And what is up with the cheesy shoe proposal? Even if Carrie did not want a diamond, with all his money he didn't buy her a ring! I would SO be regretting dumping Aiden at this point....    I laughed when Big made fun of Carrie for still going to the library. I practically live in mine. Perfect choice for a wedding locale. Would have been too pricey for me though. Overall I loved the movie, I missed the show SO much.    Women in NY live in the best city in the world. But there are still husbands who cheat, friends that get into fights, vacations, fun, work, children. Its not easy, its not as glamorous as it seems, but we wouldn't trade it for anything.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Pillars of Earth and especially Dangerous Fortune made my expectations high. World Without End lowered a bit. But I never expected the huge disappointment slapping into my face when reading this rubbish. Characters are only two dimensional narrators of a badly written history book full of commonplaces and popular misconceptions. There was no story, there were no lifelike characters, instead we got unrelated plots going from nowhere to nowhere, unbelievable shifts, and so bad symbolism you cry if you do not fall asleep when reading them.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This is the second monitor stand of this model I have purchased. It is extremely robust and easy to install (I use the through the desk \\"grommet\\" method, not side clamping) I find that using two seperate stands, rather than a single piece dual stand, allows more positioning flexability.<br />I would recommend this stand to any one looking for strength, durability and flexibility.
B004DMIIVO|4.0|I love Madhouse.  The Studio has produced some of the best anime to come out of Japan in the last decade, including the recent \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\\".  Much of that team re-assembled to put together the ambitious \\"Summer Wars\\".  The result?    I was entertained and disappointed.  I felt moments of \\"wow, that's storytelling\\" and stretches of \\"that doesn't make sense\\".  I was impressed by creative plot twists and turns that ultimately wound up in all-too-familiar territory.    One thing I found was that two dozen one-dimensional characters didn't engage me in the least, but I would have sat and listened to the wisdom and life stories of the family matriarch for hours on end.  Unfortunately, even the main players -- whom I found really interesting, or bold, or mysterious at first -- evolved into stick figure shadows of themselves by the end of the film.    Hosoda's attempt to create a sort of anime version of \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" is daring, and I admire the effort.  I couldn't escape the film without wanting to \\"tweak\\" it here and there, to temper its extremes and make its deus-ex-machina moments a little more plausible.  It was as if the writers wanted it to be a slice-of-life fantasy with romantic elements and martial arts combat mixed in with deep historical roots set in a William Gibson-esque landscape -- and the whole thing collapsed under its own weight.    So, I was less impressed by this than other Madhouse productions.  I wanted to really like this film, but instead came away with melancholy feelings of what might-have-been.
B0047WJ11G|1.0|Frankly, I don't get it.  Inception was one of the most acclaimed movies of 2010. I was anticipating great things.  Didn't see, hear or feel them.  The plot was very hard to follow, but, once I'd watched a while, I didn't much care anymore, and the whole thing became incomprehensible.  Right from the start, the film had no context; the people on the screen seemed connected to no one and nothing. They were just there for no appreciable reason. They hardly seemed connected to each other.  The dialogue was jejune - what there was of it - mostly there were declamations. The acting was either bad or missing - I was especially sorry to see the talents of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Marion Cotillard utterly wasted.  Leonardo DeCaprio is in a league of his own. It's not that he can't act - though his skills are rudimentary - he just doesn't. He seems to have one facial expression for most of the movie, although sometimes he squints. Since his is the only character dealt with at length and since he is opaque, the film lacks any emotional touchstone.  There is a lot of action, although it doesn't add up to much, perhaps because it is so random; causality is missing. Credibility is stretched until it twangs in your face - if what they all are doing is so delicate, why are they actually in a van careening around a city instead of in some quiet apartment? (Silly - quiet apartments don't plunge off of bridges.)  The vaunted special effects - I had seen virtually all of them in the trailers for the film, and, since there seemed to be no point to any of them and since they passed by rather quickly, I found them unimpressive.  The ending is supposed to be enigmatic - it is, but it is also predictable.  Moral of this story: Watch things like this on DVD - it's easier to turn them off than to struggle through a row of rapt people to escape.
B001JNNDAQ|1.0|WARNING: THIS BLUE RAY DISC IS THE WORST AND I MEAN THE VERY WORST FILM TRANSFER I HAVE SEEN ON VIDEO. SOME SCENES ARE ALL GRAIN. I don't care what they tried to do with this release, they just blew it badly. The PQ in a lot of the darker scenes is inferior to a bootlegged VHS tape. Just my opinion of course. The outdoor sunny scenes are fine. If you must see this one, RENT IT. NOT RECOMMENDED!
B0015AARJI|4.0|I have both PS3 and XBOX360. I play only on PS3 now because I prefer the PS3 controller. The two main reasons are:    [1] The locations of the PS3 analog thumbsticks are more optimal for me. My thumbs always hurt when I use XBOX360 controllers.    [2] Pressing R1 to shoot is better than pressing XBOX360 trigger because the \\"trigger pull\\" is shorter and I can shoot repeatedly without getting a sore index finger.    However, I do hate PS3 controllers on games like Dead Space, in which you need to hold down L2 and use the left analog to run, which is awkward and a pain (on my left thumb, literally). This has more to do with the games than the controllers, though.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Love this movie!  It's weird, wacky, ridiculous, and yes, preposterous, but a joy to watch.  I am definitely glad to have a copy for my collection (I didn't have any of the aforementioned problems with the DVD other than the sound was so good I had to turn down the TV set to keep from getting blasted out of my room).<br />Favorite scene, the romp in the snow with the henchmen dressed as snowmen.<br />Only complaint, wish it had been in black and white instead.  For some strange reason I thought the color dated it as unmistakably a product of the mod era.  Other than that, have I mentioned that I love this movie!?
0670021652|2.0|I enjoyed the book up until the author begin quoting the Christian views on MARRIAGE according to Paul's writings.  I totally feel that you should not rewrite and put your on spin on the bible.  The authors version on what Paul felt about marriage is way in left field.  Marriage is honorable according to the bible.  One should read the bible for themselves and not make decisions based on this book.
B0000542D2|5.0|I was 13 when this movie came out.  Wasn't into the Beatles until Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  (Kept wondering how they managed to slip by me without my noticing!)  After that I worked my way backwards: Revolver, Rubber Soul, Help!, then A Hard Day's Night. This movie is a joyous ode to a time before everything went dark.  I love everything about this movie: the music, the Beatles (of course), the fake documentary style, their madcap adventures, the spectacular camera work and brilliant editing, and of course, Paul's clean grandfather (the sly Wilfred Brambell).  Witty, charming, and just plain silly (in a good way).  A true celebration of a time I wish could have lasted forever.<br />And for the record, I don't think there's anything wrong with Ringo's nose.
B001V7P2W2|5.0|Some liberties are taken in this recreation of the famous tragedy of Toni Kurtz, but the overall film is highly watchable and spellbinding.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|First of all if you expect Ashton Kutcher to stumble through this like a sex-crazed teenager like he did on \\"That 70's Show\\" or a sex-crazed stoner in  \\"Dude Where's My Car?\\" then you will be seriously impressed with his drama acting wings. Ashton plays Evan who from an early age knows that something is wrong with him and his dad(who he never gets to see because he is locked up in a psycho ward). Evan suffers blackouts and when he wakes up from them, he notices that his world is a little different than what it was before the blackout. As an adult, he finds out that he has a \\"gift\\" that can change certain events by travelling back in time to undo or change what made the situation bad or different. But with this \\"gift\\" he must face the consequences of his actions and he learns that maybe it is best to leave things alone. The special features on this DVD show two brief documentaries about chaos theory and the belief of time travel. I saw the movie first and then watched the documentaries and was glad how they complimented the story. This DVD also offers a director's cut and theatrical version.
143911000X|5.0|This book is a must have for men everywhere! So full of wisdom and knowledge i would highly recommend this book, and strongly believe that everyone that calls himself a man should have a copy of this book.
B000Q67876|5.0|This is the kind of film that changes peoples lives. And for this movie not to have won an Academy Award shows how worthless the Oscars are. Definitely one of the all time greats... Not much of a review, I just had to throw in my two cents.
0812550757|5.0|A bit deeper then Ender's game, but I still find it great.  It opens up a ton of possibilities with the story line that apparently get lame as the series goes on, but this one is great imo.
030746363X|4.0|I've read Tim's other books and found them to be full of great tips. He has a way of explaining things very simply that make his methods easy and practical to apply. He makes some pretty amazing claims so I was naturally skeptical, but I think it delivers. It's not a silver bullet that will magically end all your health problems and turn you into a supermodel (maybe the complete title is a little sensational...) but it does offer tons of great advice that, if you make an effort to implement, can bring about a real transformation in your life and health. In just a few weeks of changing my habits I've noticed a difference. I still haven't been able to make myself try an ice bath yet... but maybe one of these days.
B000IKQMFO|2.0|I was disappointed by this movie, primarily because: (1) it is at least thirty minutes too long, (2) there are too many characters to try to track, (3), The murder comes too late in the film (up to that point it is too talky), and (4) the murder mystery is not resolved when the movie finally ends.    The BBC series Downton Abbey (shown on PBS and available on DVD) is much better.
0060899220|4.0|Stories, mostly from before the cable chef phenom, that tell the ugly wonderful life of a real chef. It ain't pretty, but it blows away the fantasy. Funny, raucous and page turning. Fun, fun.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I had a problem when purchasing this Toy Story 3 Blu-Ray, for whatever reason, the first two copies that I received didn't play. This review now becomes a review of Amazon.com. This company should be called AHHHH-MAZING.COM (10 stars). When I complained that the Blu-Ray didn't play it was replaced twice without a glitch or problem, it was replaced in2 days, twice. I did have a slight problem with the second one as I had requested a replacement, but Amazon.com accidentally gave me a credit instead. When I contacted them to complain because the price had gone up, they charged me the original discounted price and replaced it instantly without argument. This showed me that they really do pay attention, that they really do care that the customer is satisfied, and in the end, I am amazed and impressed with Amazon.com. Excellent company to buy from. I am now a huge fan.
1601251556|4.0|Okee Dokee,       I love the 2 sided feature of this Flip-mat. It wipes off easily and does the job. However, a friend of mine has a roll up one that lays perfectly flat. This is more like a laminated heavy cardboard and is rather stiff. I'm sure over time it will smooth itself out, but this kept the product from being a 5 star.    None the less I would reccomend it. Great price and get to me faster than a drow initiative.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw this DVD for the first time in December of 2009. I have not only not eaten meat since, but continued on my path to finding out more about what goes on with America's food distribution.  This DVD, while some parts are a bit alarming, is right on with how it was presented.  The truth hurts sometimes and I love that this DVD opened a lot of doors for me. I've always been an animal lover, I work with shelters, and of course have my own pets - but honestly, now that I KNOW what goes on, and have faced the truth, I will never eat meat again.  Documentaries like this need to be on TV so others can see the truth of what is happening.
1607886278|4.0|Told through Jack's eyes, the book opens with him turning five. All his life, he's lived in and eleven by eleven room, not realizing there's another world outside. His \\"Ma\\" has kept the harsh reality of their situation from him until now. The reality that they've been held captive by a man named Old Nick.<br /><br />Jack learns the truth and how he'll aid in their escape. The voice of Jack is told by the talented voice of Michal Friedman. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same with all the characters. Ellen Acher's voice as Ma seemed a bit too educated considering she'd been abducted at nineteen. Also, the voice of Old Nick sounded too young for the character's actual age. Even with these minor hiccups, the story remained a powerful one--not sad, but engrossing. I found it hard to stop listening as Jack's world changed from one he knew to one of strange wonderment.
0739368435|5.0|I listened to this book while driving to my country home on weekends and actually delayed arrival times so I could continue listening. The characters came to life for me. I even managed to develop quite the crush on Dawsey. Just loved it. Only sad that it had to end.
0385341679|5.0|This book was soooo mentally and emotionally exhausting! I marathoned this series as best as I could, reading the first 3 books over the weekend and then spending 3 days on book 5 which was considerably the longest of the series. It definitely evolved from being more UF to becoming more PNR, but this is the way it should be done in my opinion for a PNR. Normally, I have a hard time connecting with PNR books due to the believability of the characters falling in love in such a short span of pages, compared to this where it did build and build, so I was actually looking forward to it.<br /><br />I do think this book had way too many backs and forths for me to wrap my head around, confusing me at times, rather than building suspense. I think pages could have been saved there.<br /><br />My other gripe is that the author, while very descriptive and imaginative, occasionally copy/pastes several lines of text from earlier books for purposes of recollection. That feels like a slightly lazier approach than paraphrasing. I may have noticed it because I've read the books back to back, so it's all much fresher in my mind.<br /><br />Either way, I really enjoyed these books. It's shot up there to one of my favorite Urban Fantasy/Paranormal Romance series ever. It may be my favorite since my ship actually sailed. The jury is still out for my other favorite which isn't done yet. Either way, it's highly recommended, but you HAVE to start from Book 1 to truly connect to the characters.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|THIS is an excellent movie made  after the swedish version which is also very good it is the first of Hammer films horror releases in 30 years this is one of the creepiest vampire movies ever and i do not reccomend it for children under age 17 regardless of the young age of the characters LET ME IN is too creepy for young children
B004498KPU|5.0|The remastering of these already iconic videos is nothing short of genius.  Michael himself would've been proud of the way his \\"Vision\\" has been given a new perspective.<br /><br />The remix of \\"Blood on the dance floor\\" is awesome.  The sound quality on \\"keep it in the closet\\",genius!  Do yourself a favor and buy this complete collection of pop history.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Actually not only my kid is a fan of toy story series but I too loved to watch the entire series over and over again.    gt8 series.thanks for making such a lovely movies.:)
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|My family really loved HBO's [[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of Brothers]].  That series knocked my socks off.  I was hoping for the same experience with The Pacific.  If I hadn't ever seen Band of Brothers, I probably would have been completely wowed, but I just didn't get the same experience from this series.  I think part of it had to do with the difference in the campaign itself: the Band of Brothers series covered a very linear campaign from basic training, to staging, to invasion, then through the European continent to the conclusion in the east.  But the Pacific theater didn't lend itself to the same linear storyline.  Hopping from island to island posed a challenge, and I'm not certain that this story dealt with it very well.<br /><br />That's OK though.  It was still an amazing series and stands up well on its own.<br /><br />I do have a HUGE gripe though, and that's with the picture quality.  So many of the scenes were just so dark that you couldn't tell what was happening.  We thought that the problem might have been with our TV, so we paused our viewing for a couple of weeks while I tracked down any possible technical problems.  I bought the [[ASIN:B000V6LST0 Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics]] calibration disc to see if that would help.  But it was hellishly frustrating and didn't give any results.  Then I replaced the [[ASIN:B003QABV4K main lamp]] in our DLP TV, which helped some, but I don't think that was really the problem.  I finally tried the [[ASIN:B0045ASBLG Disney WOW: World of Wonder]] calibration system and am now 100% convinced that I have my TV picture completely dialed in.<br /><br />So we resumed our viewing and now we can finally see most of what's happening in those darkest scenes, but they're still really doggone dark and hard to make out.  I've played those scenes on other TVs and at friends' houses and had the same issue.  So it's not my setup.  The scenes are just too dark.  Period.  And I swear I'm not a picky guy, but I don't need the pain of my wife harping \\"huuuhney...we can't see the movie...the TV must be broken\\".  It's NOT BROKEN!  It's the movie!!!<br /><br />Anyway, the stories are really great.  Not as great as Band of Brothers, but that's a tough standard to meet and probably not fair.  You owe it to yourself and your family to know this part of our history.y...we can't see the movie...the TV must be broken\\".  It's NOT BROKEN!  It's the movie!!!

B000O179EK|1.0|Doesn't work on my player; could you send one that does? I have a Blu Ray player with up to date firmware.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|If you liked any of the Final Fantasy VII games, or even if you never seen or played it much, you will still enjoy this movie. I can say this from experience. I just briefly heard and saw some of the characters from a game called Kingdom Hearts and they peeked my intrest to say the least. I was recommended this movie to watch, and so I watched it online. I was deffinitly taken back. I had close to no knowledge of the game and I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I watched straight through and loved everything about it. Afterwards, I just had to play the original game because I loved it so much. When I did and, I understood much, much more about the movie and even caught myself going \\"oooh\\" half the time. After I beat the game, I rewatched the movie and enjoyed it twice as much if even possible. That is because this movie reintroduces these amazing characters from the 1990's style graphics (1997 to be exact) to Square Enix's legendary CGI animation. Also, because the game has no vocals you also get to hear the characters voices for the first time. Thankfully, they fit perfectly. The voice acting was outstanding, every character has a unique voice that fit their personality perfectly. I tend to be a bit picky with the voice acting I hear, but I can say now for sure that I was 100% satisfied this time. So, if you played the game first you will deffinitly be amazed by this movie (and extremely thrilled and satisifed if your a big fan like me). All aspects of it were flawless. The movie starts out with what might be considered a little bit slow for some people, with the occasional fight or dispute, but more talking than anything. That is so you can begin to grasp the story of what happened in the game, and start seeing the new story that takes place in the movie, and how the two are still connected. This also introduces you to the main characters. You very quickly see their problems starting to show and how they each handle them differently. One may fight their problemshead on, and another may \\"run away\\". As you might be picking up, the characters and story are very realistic and relatable, dispite being considered a fantasy. You will find yourself feeling for the characters, even if it's a character you were almost sure you didn't like, you may be shown a new side of things and how things look through their perspective. Before you know it, the movie picks up...a lot. Soon enough their are fights left and right, each one has it's purpose to the story thankfully and weren't just there for our entertainment, though that's a bonus. The fights are very fast pased, meaning that if you blink for too long or look away for a second you may miss about 10 attacks a character just did. They do give you some short breaks in between fights to let us take it in and catch up with what's going on. You will then be thrust into a new fight scene, and the amazing graphics really prove their worth in these. No matter how fast a character moves, they won't blur or distort. Even the backround during any scene is perfect, from every little detail. To a flower in the back, to a crack on a wall, it will all be visibly clear. The graphics redefine real, then again, its not too real where you might think \\"I might as well just watch it live-action.\\" A lot of animated films also tend to have decent graphics, but in a way distorted that gives you that \\"cartoony\\" feeling. I did not experience that at all here. From the glassiness of their eyes, to the viens in their hands, to the texture of the leather and cloth, the glare of the sun, and from each strand of hair, it's all their. One thing I loved about the Blue Ray version is that the graphics are even more enhanced. I even compared the two versions, and actually saw the amazing difference. If you were thinking of getting the original version instad, don't. If you have a Blue Ray player, get this instead, I promise it's worth it. The video and audio are improved to a great degree. They also added over 1000 edits to the film, as well as 26 minutes of extra scenes and movie time. This means that any questions the original movie you left you with (which it does), this one answers. For example, in the original all you know is that theres a disease that seems to be killing people somehow. In the new version, it is revealed how it kills people, what it does to their mind and body, and how they are treated by the rest of society. There are also a few new characters in this movie that were not in the game at all, this means they have new character stories to tell on top of reminicing about the old ones. In the original version, you understand them to a degree but not enough to fully comprehend or sympathize with them. In the new version, that all changes. You will learn about their pasts and see how they got into the story that their telling us now, and why they are there. Even the main character, Cloud, you will get great glimpses of his past. If you played Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, you will recognize those clips and they might even give you goosebumps remembering them. If not, you will get a great insight to Cloud's past, and what really happened to him to make him the way he is today. Rememeber, this movie takes place 2 years after the original Final Fantasy VII ended. It begins showing us a quick glipmse of the actual ending, which takes place 500 years into the future. They will then let you know that your now going 498 years into the past, to see what happens 2 years after the game ended. If you really think about, the way it ended didn't satisfy me completely. It left questions about what the characters could be doing. This movie shows us what all the characters are now doing.    In addition to all of this, this movie also has great special features. Their are several special features that recap on the games. One recapes on the original game, giving about an hour worth of great scenes, and also showing you how much their graphics dramatically changed. Even so, it shows you how that old game still contained so much life, and how it was actually amazing and considered to still be on the top ranking of video games. They also show recaps of the three other Final Fantasy VII games (Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus, and FiThenal Fantasy VII: Before Crisis). They show you this in two ways, one lets you see the games in order they came out. Another lets you see what order they were in relating to the story, not just by the games, but by their specific scenes. In addition to all of this, theres a special feature that lets you see first hand what one of the new character's past was like, they do this in an anime form. It was very well done and was about an hour long. Last but not least, they give a very nice trailer of their newest game, Final Fantasy XIII.    As for languages, you can easily change it to the original japanese version. If not, you could keep it at it's english version, or a french version which they also offer. The subtitles also come in many languages of course.     All in all, this movie was amazing. No pictures you find online or anywhere can compare to seeing it on the big screen. Even if your not a Final Fantasy VII fan, or only know a little about it, I still believe you will find many things to love about this movie. As long as you pay attention, it is not that hard to catch on to the story and what exactly is going on. Even if you didn't play the original game? Yes. You could always watch the recap from the special features first, which is a good idea. On my first time though, I didn't. I knew nothing, yet I was extacic afterward. Now, if you are a Final Fantasy VII fan, you will undoubtly love it. They show all the characters you knew and loved in the game, and I mean all. The supporting characters do come back for epic fight scenes, and you can watch them all in action together while the story continues to unfold around them. You will also get to see things from the game that you always dreamed of seeing in CGI. For example, Cloud's sword, Sephiroth's wing, Cloud's motercyle (which they redid, making it much more futuristic and it carries his swords too), Barret's gun, Vincent's cloak, Yuffie's weapon, Red XIII's tail, even all these little details will be there to see, including almost anything else you may want to see. They also capture the characters personalities very well, even just their facial expressions are what I could see them wearing in the game at parts. Also, if there are certain characters you miss or wish you could see but doubt they'll be there, you may be in for surprises.    As for quality, I was 100% happy with this product. It never, ever lagged on me and I watched it several times. I became very used to things running slow with me, but I was surprised this didn't. In fact, it was on the fast side. The disc and box was in perfect condition as well. It was completely worth the money. This is coming from someone who rarely buys things online because of the fear of wasting money on a bad product. You will not be sorry, this movie is great for anyone. There are some cursing and blood however, if you don't mind that then your all set. I give this product 5 stars, and that is the first time I have ever done that.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|The wait is over.  Soldier of Love is the first album by Sade after a ten-year hiatus.  Don't you dare call this a comeback since her music never left us.  From the first hit \\"Diamond Life\\" in 1984 until now, the band's music has stayed on our radios and turntables.  Soldier of Love is fine and mellow poetry, Sade at her lyrial best.  In the past a Sade album could be compared to a fine Merlot, a wine to accompany polite dinner conversation. Her style, like her pulled-back hair, was always understated elegance.  But this time Sade rocks our world and takes her time taking us through heartache and redemption with a bit more fire and a little Jamaican rum punch (\\"Babyfather\\").  This disc is earthy and dense, pulling us onto the dance floor with the title cut \\"Soldier of Love\\".  We are privileged to go behind the scenes and spy the secrets of her diary and we can't wait to turn the next page.  \\"The Moon and the Sky\\" is a passionate lullaby recounting love that might have been.  If love is a battlefield then Sade is leading the charge.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Buy this album and then go back and buy all of their other cds.  Hazards of Love is delicious.  Actually, they all are.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I just love this cd, I blast it in the car while driving anywhere. It has a good variety of songs.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|I liked the movie, but it didn't really make sense.  Who was the original target for the female assassin?  If it was Clooney whey go through the entire process of making the gun etc?  She could have killed him a dozen times anytime.<br /><br />I like to think the priest for some reason was the original target, but then it changed after Jack said 'he as out'.  Why else would she be at the procession?  How could she possibly know he would be there?
1401923127|5.0|Well explained, easy to understand, based on scientific research.  If you own and operate a body, this book is a valuable manual that will clearly explain how your body does what it does.  Most importantly, it helps clarify how to make adjustments when it isn't operating as you want it to! ;-)<br /><br />This book is so revolutionary that I have sent it to my family and I'm re-reading it!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a great movie. I loved it the music was wonderful and dancing was just right. I could not keep still in my seat when I was watching it. I can't wait for the movie to come out. The only thing i was disappointed about was the cover. I really wish they would have stuck with the original.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent fun for anyone even vaguely entertained by zombies.  Since you have stumbled on this book by some intentional act this means you are someone who will enjoy this book.  Go with you instincts and just buy it.  You might as well pick up the Zombie Survival guide too while you are at it for the same reason.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I received this DVD in a timely manner.  It arrived in excellent condition.  Very happy with this purchase.
073935650X|4.0|This book is about a boy, Clay, who receives some tapes. When he starts listening to them, he realizes they are from Hannah, a girl he liked a lot. She also happens to have recently committed suicide.<br />There are 7 tapes, 13 sides total, each listing a person and a reason why that person played a role in her decision to kill herself. Some of these reasons seem pretty trivial. A couple are pretty harsh. All in all, it seems like mostly small things that build up in someone not strong enough to handle the hurt and someone who gives up pretty easy. She is looking for people to blame and justify her decision. That part kind of bothered me, but the story was very compelling. I couldn't wait to hear how Clay played into the story. While his tape kind of surprised me, and I could see some people not caring for it, I actually really liked it.<br />I listened to this story on audio book, and it definitely kept my attention the whole time. Also, there are two people reading it, one for Clay and one for Hannah. This really helped. I worry that the skipping back and forth between characters in the book could be confusing, but hearing a girl and a boy talking helped. There were many parts where you heard Hannah talking, and Clay would break in with just a word or a small sentence. I really hope this was written well into the story to not make it confusing.
0399230033|5.0|I can't comment on the paperback (which has words, I guess), but the board book is great. There are no words, so you have to describe what's going on yourself, which I actually prefer, since I frequently do this anyway with books that have words (whether because the words just don't catch my daughter's attention or because I just think it's more creative to discuss the pictures and describe the story). What's cool about this book is that if you look in the background of every picture, you can watch the red balloon slowly get smaller and smaller as it goes further away, and the same thing for the moon! When I realized this, I thought it was so cool (since it's not something you might notice right away), and when I showed my daughter, she LOVED showing me how she could find the balloon and the moon on every page!! (and I made a big deal when she did!) I don't know how the paperback version (with words) goes, but I love this one and so does my daughter! (And if you find you like the little hidden/less obvious things, you can do the same thing with \\"Goodnight, Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown - there's a tiny little mouse that you can try to follow from picture to picture, and it's NOT part of the intentional part of the story, since it's not described in the words anywhere - just, I think, a cool addition, and my daughter loves finding it, too!)
B001E45XT4|3.0|This headset can be pretty tight on your head. Especially if you have a large one like I do. The sound quality is mediocre at best. The microphone works well and the overall headset is built pretty solid. For the price it is a fair deal. But if you are looking for excellent headset buy something else.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I first read about this book in my Sunday paper book review, just prior to the book's release date. How nice to be able to purchase it within minutes on Amazon and have it delivered to my Kindle once it was available!   It was refreshing to read a book about magicial creatures that held enough twists that kept you guessing. Although some of the story lines were predicitable, there were enough curves thrown in that you kept turning the pages. The author did a nice job allowing you to form your own opinions about each new situation before she tied everything together for you. It was nice to see how history was woven into the story lines. The ending was not satisfactory, in my opinion. It was almost like the author forgot to send the next chapters. I can only keep my fingers crossed that the follow up book will be just as great and appear quickly!
B004856SQ8|4.0|Good movie. Worth watching a few times. Only scene that was a lil messed up was with the tank but other then that over all very nice.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|Now I know you have heard this statment before BUT: \\"This really is the best Motohead has sounded since Fast Eddie Clark quit\\" Really...No Joke!        Fight for The ROCK and Die for the METAL!!!!!    JRK
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All 3 of these books are amazing!!!  Original and gripping right from the start.  I couldn't put down and I highly highly recommend!!!!!!
B001E45XT4|5.0|Extremely comfy especially if you have a small head. Mic seems kinda rickety but sound quality is very good. For the $$ this is a great pair of heaphones with a mic that is unnoticeable when rotated up into the arc piece.
0670022411|5.0|I saw this book reviewed in People magazine. It looked like something I would love to read. I purchased the E-Book for the Kindle App on my Evo 4G phone. I could not stop reading this! I read it at work and was up until two this morning reading it. Time just seemed to slip away while caught up in the lives of Diana and Matthew and the others in their lives. This is a great read and I can't wait for the next book. 5 Stars from me! :)
1580176941|5.0|Cookie Craft: From Baking to Luster Dust, Designs and Techniques for Creative Cookie Occasions is considered the must have book for anyone who wants to learn how to make beautiful cookies or just wants some extra information to hone their current skills. The authors were searching for a book that would \\"instruct and inspire\\" them about cooking making and they couldn't find the right one to suit their needs. So, they researched and experimented until they were ready to write the book that they'd been hoping for. They did an outstanding job and it's a privilege to learn from their years of trial and error.<br /><br />Cookie Craft is full of instructive tips every step of the way, with suggestions like: If you are a beginner you may want to start by decorating your unbaked cookies. Then you can gradually add more techniques until you are ready for something as ambitious as cookie construction, like a festive Christmas sleigh that is constructed to hold even more cookies! Excellent (and charming) illustrations accompany almost every clearly explained technique to help you visualize how to accomplish it.<br /><br />There is a large section of gorgeously decorated treats for every celebration, with instructions on how to create each one. I was particularly interested in how to keep cookies from spreading in the oven. They advocate a roll, chill and cut method that is described in detail and has many benefits.<br /><br />Scattered throughout the book are helpful ideas like how to color your own sugar and coconut and how to best keep track of your cookie cutter collection. Each tip includes explanations of the best practices, so you really understand not just \\"what\\" to do, but \\"why\\" it works well to do it that way. They also give excellent advice regarding cookie events, such as how to plan swaps, parties and bake sales. There are also templates and resources to buy supplies from included in the back of the book. Cookie Craft is a wonderful resource for any cookie baker to return to over and over again.again.
B0000041TD|5.0|I was introduced to Boheme years ago by the dean of St Louis University Medical School. It has been a favorite of mine ever since. I have often given it as a gift for new and old friends over the years. Pavarotti is second to none and Harwood is a treat.
B000003TA9|5.0|Dirty was like Goo's crazier older sister, yeah? Or was she the psycho cousin?<br /><br />The early nineties mark the years that Sonic Youth obtained commercial success. With that they released a handful of albums that went a little bit easier on the avante-noise-fest explosions that they had spent most of the eighties exploring, and decided to let it down with some 'alternative' music. The results were excellent, and Goo and Dirty still remain my favorite Sonic Youth albums on the list, even though I think they have released some incredibly brilliant material before and since.<br /><br />Goo and Dirty are fun. Jet Set and Washing Machine were too, but they didn't quite nail it on the head sideways like Goo and Dirty did. Out of the two there is no 'best'. Goo was more of an album of epics, and Dirty shines in more of a cut and paste style, with a larger number of shorter tracks that bleed together. There are obvious stand outs, that will always bring me back to the glorious early nineties, such as Sugar Kane and Chapel Hill and Drunken Butterfly, but the whole thing is a jam. None of that filler that you get on so many other 'alternative' titles. Sonic Youth was and always will be cool, but in the grunge days- they brought the cool down on cool. Wheres my T-shirt?!
0385523912|5.0|Excellent book which tells the story of several North Koreans who defected to the south, after (somehow - barely) surviving the horrific famine in the 90s. The writing is very accessible, the individual narratives fascinating.  The picture of North Korea is a cross between a bad dream and a science fiction book (1984 comes to mind) except it is real.  Highly recommended.
B004JVXTL8|2.0|The first one was waaay better. The whole connecting them together was kinda cool but the scares and especially the ending were laaaaaame!

B001E75QGG|2.0|It was a risky move returning to the Indiana Jones series.  With Star Wars, George Lucas set the story an entire generation earlier.  With the Indiana Jones series, even the series is named after the star, and such a film would be virtually unthinkable without Harrison Ford.  I like Harrison Ford, but he's getting on in years, and there's nothing more pathetic than 60-year-old men trying to act like they are 30 years old.  So instead of changing the character (or the actor), George changed the story - the year is not 193x, it is 195x. The bad guys are not Nazis but Soviets.  The B-movie template the adventure is grafted onto is not the 1930s serials but science-fiction masking as cold-war paranoia.  And in this George Lucas was absolutely correct - this is the way Indiana Jones could be pulled off 20 years later.  Unfortunately, this great idea is not carried off successfully and the film just isn't as good as I would expect from an Indy film.    Prof. Henry Jones Jr. is still teaching archaeology at a liberal arts university, and still moonlighting as a \\"collector of rare antiquities\\".  He is kidnapped by Soviet agents and forced into the very warehouse that houses the Ark of the Covenant.  The Soviets, however, are after the Crystal Skull - an artifact of great power (potentially, at least) and that generates an impossibly strong (by modern science's understanding) magnetic field.  Thus Indy is off with a few others in tow to find the origin of the crystal skull.    There are many great parts about this film.  Some of the action sequences rival the best (many are non-CGI!) sequences from the previous films.  Marian Ravenwood returns, and she is just as spunky as ever (and, remarkably, looks to have aged far less than Indy).  There are flashes of humour - I especially liked the student asking Professor Jones a question in the middle of a chase scene through the University library.  Sure, it sounds cheesy and contrived when written in a text review, but all of Indiana Jones is designed that way, the fun is the new ways in which the same contrivances are presented.  And the addition of Shia Lebouef as a younger, brash sidekick is not as annoying as you'd think - in fact, I grew to quite like young Mutt.    But, but, but.....  Ultimately, the film descends into a giant CGI-fest that wears out its welcome in the second half.  The snakes, bugs, and rats in Indys 1,2,and 3 are real critters, and therefore creepy - you know Willie is sticking her hand into an alcove of creepy crawlies, or that Marian has fallen into a pit of vipers.  In Indy 4 we get CGI ants that ooze homogeneous pink goo when squished and who apparently have a hive intellegence.  Worse yet, the climax of the film mostly consists of the main characters staring at a blue screen.  I was reminded of Richard Dreyfuss's famous comment to Spielberg about Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind - \\"Have you decided what we're staring at yet, Stephen?\\"  But worst of all, Indiana Jones is neutered by the end because of the introduction of Oxley, the expert on the Crystal Skulls.  All Indy can manage is to ask Oxley, again and again (and again!) \\"what do we do now?\\" \\"How did you get through here the last time?\\" \\"Where do we go next?\\" \\"How do we defeat this guardian/lock/trap?\\"  This is not the Indiana Jones who can read heirogliphics, knows the legends of the Thugee cult, and who can \\"fly? yes. Land? No!\\" but proceeds to fly the plane anyways.    So I am all the more disappointed that such a promising premise degenerated by the end into mush.  I'm not sure wherein the problem lies - certainly it's not with Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen or Shia Lebouef.  It's not even with Harrison Ford (at least, not his acting).  They do the best they can.  No, ultimately, I guess the blame must be laid at one (or both) of Lucas and Speilberg for not being able to pull it off.  It's a shame, too, because I really wanted to like this film.  Finally, I can't get over the title.  Why \\"Kingdom\\" of the Crystal Skull?  Why not just \\"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull\\"?  Or \\"Indy and the search for El Dorado\\"? or \\"the City of Gold\\"?  Worst name ever.... except for \\"Attack of the Clones\\".    This Blu-ray edition has some nice extras in it, mostly making-of stuff.  But, as with Lucas's other films, the making-of stuff has clearly been edited and presented in a form that makes it interesting and informative, rather than the haphazard extras most DVDs and Blu-rays include.
B004DK5CW4|2.0|Great if you are on a transatlantic flight & can't sleep on planes.  Typical Disney mushy film.  Only good scenes were the race scenes with the low camera angles.  No real story.  Save your time for Seabiscut.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Excellent cooler. $30 bucks for it is a steal. I gave up on the stock cooler and tried this. My cpu is easily ten degrees cooler. Especially, under a strong workload. Excellent buy.
B000MGUZM0|1.0|When I review an album, I review all the aspects of the album.   Now to start off, the album title goes against my religion as I am a follower of Islam.  The word \\"Bible\\" deeply offends me and my family.  I have to hide this album in my bedroom so my wife and kids do no find it.  I am shamed by this.    Now for the music.  The music is bland, hipster music.  I enjoyed Funeral and even the (now) award winning 'The Suburbs', but this one really feels tired no matter how you look at it.  The last song \\"My Body is a Cage\\" is one of their most powerful tunes, but other than that you shouldn't expect much from this (especially the first half).
0345528581|5.0|Excellent workout for home or on the road. I love the idea of using whatever you have available wherever you are, whenever you have time. Well Done!
1557048630|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and it was more then i expected.    This book is well designed, showing everything from the origins of the story to character design to editing and making the movie.  This book shows, what it seems, all the art that went into making this movies. Every character's process to the final design, every location and in the end even the making of the movie, like story board, designing scene by scene, and editing the movie    its a wonderful book for people who love the movie and love books that shows how the movie was done
B00008973A|3.0|I was not all that impressed with this video. I saw the original on broadway and was disappointed that they cut some great songs, changed the presentation on others and added  one or two new songs....all this so they could redirect the focus to more dance numbers, i guess to balance the production and give it better mass appeal.  All in all, while entertaining, i preferred the original broadway show.
0810982862|3.0|this book is definitely not what i had hoped for.     i very much love art books from movies but this one disappointed me, 90% of the book is bad quality screen shots from the movie with some lines around it to make it look like someone drew to make it look like an actual drawing...    its badly designed everything is unclear and you move from topic to topic without knowing which part you are looking at.     there were a few good sections where you see the original images of the developing characters, but there is only a few of them and they not covering most of the characters.

B004DMIIOG|5.0|There have been many excellent reviews written about Summer Wars already, but as a member of a family that does not frequently watch Japanese animation I have an obligation to let people know that this is not a niche film. Summer Wars, like all great animation, succeeds on many levels. It has stunning visuals, an excellent and intriguing story, (that's not hard to follow despite it being largely set in cyberspace) and excellent characters. The story is about a family, but, unlike so many animated films, the family doesn't take a backseat to the story--it IS the story. It's amazing to watch a realistically depicted (although delightfully quirky) family reunion transform into a show of touching family resolve that will ultimately inspire viewers both young and old. I highly recommend Summer Wars to be viewed as a family or, of course, by any lovers of animation.<br /><br />One last thing I have to add. The Jinnouchi family's matriarch, Sakae, is the true star of this film. She is a character that you will not soon forget. Satoko Okudera, the screenwriter of Summer Wars, manages to bring to Japanese cinema an elderly woman that demands respect for her both her wisdom and her bravery.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|i love it ..one of the best album of madonna!  if you want to be happy u must own it into your collection ;-)
B000H5TVKI|5.0|I didn't expect a whole lot for the blu-ray version of this film.  It's 30 years old and most scenes are high contrast light/dark.    Well, they did an amazing job..PERIOD.  Dolby 5.1 and DTS HD..They didn't skimp on this one AT ALL    Plus the commentaries of Stallone(ok) and the author of the book(Great) this is a blu ray you'll be proud to have in you collection    If you like this movie and want a good blu-ray of it..it will never get any better than this..I'm shocked they did this well..    Lionsgate works their magic again

1439153663|5.0|Orphaned and left alone upon arriving in America from Ireland, Lavinia is sold to a southern plantation owner and sent to work in the kitchen house, alongside the plantation's slaves.   Hungry for the love of family, Lavinia adopts the slaves on the plantation that she is closest with as her own family....viewing them as mother, father, and siblings.  But eventually Lavinia comes to the reluctant understanding that despite the love that she feels for her family, it cannot change the life differences that skin color has thrust upon them all.  Years pass, and Lavinia grows up....but must eventually face up to the cruelty that faces her family, and confront it, with them.  An extraordinary pageturner of a part of the slave era rarely told.      DYB

0060833459|5.0|Had to read this for grad school.  Glad I did.  Very informative and practical.  Great for anyone who wants to improve their effectiveness level in any aspect of their lives.
B003GK21U8|2.0|This book sucked. That is the best way to put it. The only reason I did not gave 2 stars is because there is another book that sucks even more (Fireflies in december) but I digress. The characters are quite plain and clich&eacute;. They also seem to suffer from multiple personality disorder because they change considerably and almost magically from who they were in the beginning and who they were in the end.<br /><br />When I was a teenager I loved reading Sidney Sheldon's book. Everybody was gorgeous and brave and fabulous and had great sex and the stories could be made in to a soap opera thanks to the absurd twists and turns of destiny. Those kind of books were enjoyable for me then but not anymore. My point is that if I read the eye of the needle when I was 16 I would have probably like it quite a bit.
B003AXAS60|4.0|Its a cute stuff no doubt but too small in size. I was expecting a bigger toy by specifications. Nevertheless nice collection :)
B000AJIAOO|5.0|This CD is terrific, every song.  They may be a hard rock band but  this CD has melody not just noise.  The singer is the best.  Beautiful  voice.  Great lyrics.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This was my first Lisa Gardner book.  I enjoyed the suspense she created through her twists and turns of the plot.  It kept me guessing and wanting to read more.  Definitely recommend reading!
B000FC13Y0|1.0|I decided to read this book because I saw the movie.  Based off how much I liked the movie and the characters, I figured the book would be 100x better.  The book read very much like a summary over parts that should have had more description, like between the hero and heroine.  The characters were sadly under-developed: the star suddenly is in love with Tristan and he is in love with her.  I know they spent most of the happiest part of their lives together on the floating ship, but that`s about as descriptive as the author gets on their relationship and interaction together.  They hardly even had conversations during that time.  When Tristan returns from Wall, and he finds he's love the star all along, all I kept thinking was that she was his rebound.  If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with?  Don't get me wrong, because I wanted them to have their happily ever after.  I just wish there was some/more build up to it besides that Tristan forgot the color of Victoria's eyes.<br /><br />I mean, the book is supposed to be better than the movie, right?  I feel a little cheated.  At least I can watch the movie to fill in the gaps.

B000Q6GXW2|4.0|Its 300. the movie rocks. I bought this because I thought my Xbox could play HD DVDs. Not sure if the old ones will but the newest slim Xbox model WILL NOT play this as an HD DVD. Not too bad since I could flip it over and play it as a regular DVD. I'm sure I could have avoided this had I done a little research on the new Xbox. Overall, 300 rocks.

B003B02PF4|5.0|I was very surprised to read all the negative reviews for this book. Maybe it scored so low because the readers are impatient. The book starts of slow but keeps building up and will have you at the point where you won't be able to put it down. I highly recommend it. It is not boring. It is very well written and takes you on a journey through Italy with the main character.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Long before playing the overly cynical, pill-popping doctor in House, Hugh Laurie and longtime comic partner Stephen Fry co-starred in this BBC series adapted from P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves\\" stories (if you can find copies of the stories, give them a read). The acting chemistry between Laurie and Fry is very evident in this series but it's not surprising since they have had a comic partnership starting years before the J&W series (check out the series \\"A Bit of Fry & Laurie\\" on DVD as well as their appearances on other shows such as \\"Blackadder\\" and \\"Alfresco\\"). Laurie's character of \\"Bertie Wooster\\" is the polar opposite of his current character, Dr. Gregory House, on \\"House.\\" Whereas Gregory House is a overly-cynical, and jaded medical genius, \\"Bertie Wooster\\" is a semi-naive, upper class twit who is rescued from various misadventures by his always immaculate valet, Jeeves (played by Stephen Fry).    For fans of British comedy, this series is a must-have. I consider it one of Britain's best.

B000001DTM|4.0|#1) \\"Zoo Nation\\"- This is a preparing energetic song. Not that fast though, but still a great opener. Acceptable lyrics. 5/5<br /><br />#2) \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\"- Subtly, this song is urging for forgiveness. Great guitar. Reasonable crescendo. Powerful. 5/5<br /><br />#3) \\"One\\"- With it constantly being played on radio, it loses its potential. Togetherness is its subject. A bit too slow. 3.5/5<br /><br />#4) \\"Until the End of The World\\"- Shame, shame, shame. Guilt and vengeance. 2.5/5<br /><br />#5) \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\"- This song is relatable, but, it's apparently a post-break-up song. But you shouldn't listen to a song like this more than 3 times even though it sounds captivating. 3/5<br /><br />#6) \\"So Cruel\\"- Same with #5. A crescendo at the end with falsetto vocals, but I gotta come down on it because it's a post-break-up song. 3/5<br /><br />#7) \\"The Fly\\"- A revelation song, not biblically per se. There's a questionable line in it that goes \\"Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief/all kill their inspiration and sing about the grief.\\" 3/5<br /><br />#8) \\"Mysterious Ways\\"- The exquisite rhythm could take someone away, but concretely, this song is basically a helpful implied and ambiguous story. Catchy chorus. 4.5/5<br /><br />#9) \\"Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World\\"- Just what it says. Didn't stand out, but sounds pretty tasty. 3.5/5<br /><br />#10) \\"Ultaviolent (Light My Way)\\"- Sounds pretty decent. Waiting for someone to heal your low self-esteem. Something for people in a rut, so it isn't worth listening to too much. 3/5<br /><br />#11) \\"Love is Blindness\\"- Deep song, but I couldn't wait for it to be over because of the shoddy rhythm quality. 2.5/5<br /><br />Overall grade= %70, while 4/5= %80, so rounded off, I was \\"correct\\" about this album's rating (subjective to different opinions).
0670022411|4.0|I found the mix of fantasy, academia, science and history made this story one of the most entertaining reads in a long while.  Although there are echoes of the Twilight series throughout the book I found that both  the characters and multiple elements of the soryline were so deftly developed by the author that I enjoyed it more!  The characters are more mature and the storyline line more complex.  A light and engaging read with all the necessary elements of romance, mystery,fantasy and drama - highly recommended!
B00095NX9G|5.0|The video lessons are clear and concise.  The dance chirography is gorgeous, and watching Rachael is always a treat.       The yoga sessions are well thought out with an eye on maximizing physical conditioning while respecting the time needs of the average person.    I plan to use the yoga sections with my man as they are ideal for strengthening the abdominal muscles, and creating a flexible stable spine.      The mini lectures at the end of disk two are especially helpful for taking your dance to another level.
B00464CU7M|5.0|I first noticed Miss Jenkins while surfing through You Tube and wanted to see more. You Tube showed several excerpts from this concert at the huge O2 arena in London, which took place in March, 2010. I was struck by the colorful sets, the clever mimes and dancing extras that were featured, but most of all struck by Catherine Jenkins stunning outfits, her delightful British charm, and most of all, her incredible mezzo-soprano voice. If you like vocal artists in the vein of Sarah Brightman, Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli, this concert is for you. I was just blown away!
0792163710|5.0|One of the best iconic westerns ever made.  Alan Ladd stars as Shane, a wandering gunslinger who attempts to change his way of life by working as a farm hand owned by a family of homesteaders played by Jean Arthur and Van Heflin.  Little does Shane realize that the homesteaders are threatened by the cattle ranchers in a hostile range war.  Run ins with the hired guns in town almost make Shane take up his gun again to deal with the antagonists but his hidden love for Jean Arthur's character keeps him held in check.  Finally realizing that his makeshift family and the other homesteaders are in mortal danger, Shane decides that there is no running away from his past and what he really is...a deadly gunslinger.  He heads into town to face down the cattleman and the gun man he hired played excellently by a very young Jack Palance.  Directed by George Stevens, this is one of the best movies ever.  Features include commentary by George Stevens Jr and the original movie trailer.  Enjoy!
B002ZG976U|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie.  I had just learned a year or two that Christina Aguilera has \\"the voice\\", and is the real deal.  With so many getting the Diva nod these days, she must be one of the very few Divas' Divas.  But I didn't realize how right on this take was until we saw Burlesque!  Whoa!!!  When the curtain was coming down, and then Cher says to stop the dropping curtain, my timbers were already shivering!  And even I'm not sure what that means!  The power of that voice!!!  It's a cute movie, and yes, a bit contrived.  What isn't these days!  But as one reviewer noted, there's good chemistry between Cher and Christina, and it's a decent vehicle to showcase the production numbers.  And those production numbers!  Have a look at the trailer; the number \\"I am a good girl\\" is everywhere.  Great to see Cher still going strong and a good number from her that won a Globe!  Chicago got raves with three song and dance amateurs (?) out front, and here's a Diva who, like Cher, will be around for decades, in her big screen debut.  Cher appreciates it, and I've always appreciated C/her.  It's a good show, and she, Christina, is \\"a good girl\\"!  Truly!  (What did happen to those pearls?)

B003UESJH4|5.0|When you take a simple premise of;<br /><br />-a person has a stuttering problem;<br /><br />- they need a counselor to help them overcome this because public<br />  speaking will be an important aspect of this person's job and<br /><br />-  the movie culminates with simply a \\"big speech\\"<br /><br />That hardly sounds like a cinematic situation yet \\"The King's Speech\\" makes this premise absolutely enthralling. By the time the movie ends, with the giving of that \\"King's Speech\\", you, the viewer, will feel very satisfied.<br /><br />This movie is exceptional because of the acting and chemistry between Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth, the incredible direction and exsquisite attention to period details.<br /><br />The movie probably will be better on DVD since this movie deserves repeated viewings.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|As the title states, this movie changed a generation. I saw it on the big screen when i was in 7th grade and trust me so did everyone else that year. By the end of the year we all knew one fact: we wanted a Supra, an RX-7, an Eclipse or anything we could at least pass off as being worthy. Blame this film for all the Cavaliers, Sunfires and other cars with horrible paint jobs and spoilers that are too big to serve any practical purpose.     The acting is comical at times, but maybe thats just my friends and I. After seeing the movie too many times its still good. This movie is responsible for my ownership of a Mazda RX-8. My brother bought an RX-7 shortly after we saw the film.     All in all, the movie is awesome. The special effects are awesome and the races are entertaining. When Dom (Vin Diesel) lauches from the line, the camera takes the viewer through the internal workings of a Mazda Wankel Rotary Engine; a testament to the special effects team.     This movie is fast and full of action, just dont count how many times they shift...

B002LVVCQM|5.0|The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins<br /><br />The Greatest Show on Earth is another solid book in a series of books by Richard Dawkins. This book has to do with the evidence in support of evolution. The book is composed of the following thirteen chapters: 1.Only a theory? 2. Dogs, cows and cabbages, 3.The primrose path to macro-evolution, 4.Silence and slow time, 5.Before our very eyes, 6.Missing link? What do you mean `missing'? 7. Missing persons? Missing no longer, 8. You did it yourself in nine months, 9.The ark of the continents, 10.The tree of cousinship, 11.History written all over us, 12. Arms race and `evolutionary theodicy', and 13.There is grandeur in this view of life.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1.  When Mr. Dawkins speaks, people listen. He has a solid track record that mirrors science.<br />2.  Absolutely love the author's conviction, backed by scientific evidence. There is passion behind his words.<br />3.  No one better at combining evolutionary biology knowledge and communication than Dawkins.<br />4.  Great illustrations.<br />5.  Co-evolution explained.<br />6.

RNA world theory.<br />15. Excellent appendix on history-deniers.<br />16. A bibliography worthy of the author.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. I get the sense this book was a bit rushed because it doesn't have the same eloquence as previous books.<br />2. Not as concise as it should have been.<br /><br />In summary, this is a very solid book. It's not the best book on evolution for the masses that distinction goes to Mr. Coyne, \\"Why Evolution Is True\\" but excellent nonetheless.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I was incredibly disappointed by this book and will not buy any sequels. It was obviously set up to have us wanting to know what happens next and guess what? I don't really care. The premise was so ridiculous about a special book stuck in the library and all the creatures hovering about wanting it. The main character, Diana was a silly girl not a professional woman as the author described her. Matthew started out as a tolerable (barely) vampire then 2/3 into the book started spouting off \\"mon coeur\\" etc. Honestly, I guess he suddenly rediscovered his French-ness later. Yes, I will accept the author was very knowledgable with all the quotes, history and famous people (*eye roll*)  but that didn't distract from the fact that the love story between the two just didn't seem authentic. I didn't feel any passion between them. Just like two bad actors using dialog in Hollywood movie (\\"mon amour\\"). Honestly, the sexist part between the two was so overdone and cliche. I also found the writing disjointed where sometimes it would be in the first person (Diana) then all about Matthew and the greater chunk of the book just mixed up. So many unappealing and uninteresting characters. Suffice it to say, I did read the entire book (skimmed last parts) but I do not want to be subjected to that again. I would have been quite happy spending $14.99 for a great book.

0143038419|3.0|I know some people are rabid in their love for this memoir. I did enjoy this book, but I wouldn't say I was over the moon with it. Gilbert's voice was very genuine and I always love that about a memoir. If a memoir doesn't feel like the person is truly being themselves, then it loses something for me.I do admire Gilbert's moxie, though. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to do what she did.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first third and last third more than the middle portion. Gilbert's time in India moved very slowly and I didn't enjoy it as much as I did her retelling of her time spent in Italy and Bali.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this memoir, but perhaps with less zeal than other readers.
B00065MDSG|4.0|I was a fan of King Crimson from the release of the first album. I saw this band premier this album. I didn't like it at the time because it was so radically different than the first four albums. It has aged well. The mix of electronic instuments and effects with all the percussion is very interesting. Frip's soloing on 'Easy Money' is fantastic. I wonder if Fripp was subconsciously undermining the singer because John Wetton has a good voice but the performances and the recorded sound of the voice is just terrible but there's only three songs with singing. Regardless of the flaws the music is so creative and powerful.
B001LB1I5S|5.0|I think I can safely say that this is the best-known and best-loved opera of all (well - perhaps we must make a Trilogy of this, Butterfly and Turandot [not 100% Puccini], should be included. So placing another offering in the market-place is a risk. Some will find it too-oft performed. And for other's the Verona is not a satisfactory production venue.<br /><br />When reviewing an opera, I look to see how well the characters and story come off. Quality of orchestra, chorus and conductor must have a unified presentation, along with settings,and, of course, the direction. Without these qualities, the world's top soloits can find themselves in a disaster<br /><br />I am happy to say that all aspects unite in a production that holds no significant flaws to detract from the performance The skilled team of singers/actors, second-layer soloists, chorus, orchestra,  and, of course, conductor,designs and construction, excellent lighting, sound, camera work and editing, video direction -- all seem to unite in this quality, traditional version. Seeing it on the screen the cameras cn bring intimacy or grandeur. You will find one or two productions where Tosca sings slightly better. But ask yourself :is this a production to exhibit a famous singer or two, or is it a production that would satisfy Puccini's intention? To me, in the item under revew, yhe singing is uniformly good, but the unity of the performance is what make this Tosca shine.<br />The first thing that impressed me was the settings, ample space being available for the singers/actors to give an outstanding disc. There is something special about going to a live performance, but for me, with a large projection screen and a quality sound system; I can take my pick of what seems the best performance from around the world, and I would include this in that group -, and watch it in  \\"you-are-there\\") presentation in the comfort of home.<br /><br />In this review you are not going to get any analysis of voice-production, etc., just s subjective response as to whether everything \\"worked\\".  And, as you will gather from the above, this performance really \\"works\\". There is no sense of being lost in the vast arena at all. And at this point, I can think of little more to say. If you want a good strong presentation of the opera, I would suggest you investigate this. If you want a production with a world-famous soprano overshadowing the opera itself, then look elsewhere.. I prefer to see/hear what the composer intended.<br /><br />Final comment:Europe is brimming with opera companies and soloists, who don't want to travel too much.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Where is the Austen in this Austen \\"adaptation\\"? Little from the original, beyond the names of the characters, remains in this sorry attempt; characters are altered, society is turned on its head, and custom is thrown to the wind - in short, everything that made Pride and Prejudice the masterpiece that it is is discarded in favor of dramatic flare and overblown romantic nonsense. Which is all too bad - Knightley is a capable actress, and, with a script that was worthy of the name, would likely have made a very interesting Elizabeth Bennett. Alas, but this version is to Austen's novel (and previous film interpretations) what a preschooler's scribble is to the Mona Lisa.<br />One of the beauties of Jane Austen's works was her depiction of social reality - the austere social boundaries, the condescension with which those who crossed them were met, the petty grievances and wiles of social climbers, etc., etc. The decision makers behind this film, however, apparently found that all far too tedious, and, in their wisdom, opted instead to introduce a host of classic elements of refined society, such as pigs in the house and a family full of eavesdroppers congregated about every door. While her family was mingling with the swine and fixing their ears to the nearest entryway, this Lizzy, unlike the intelligent but flawed Elizabeth of the book, preferred to simper and smirk more than anything else. Poor Mr. Darcy, however, fares no better, and wanders about aimlessly in this film, seeming at times as if he suffers more from bowel discomfort than symptoms of the heart. The rest of the characters fall into this pattern, seeming little more than absurd caricatures or parodies of the original.<br />The scenarios are no less appalling than the characters. Gone are the societal strictures that governed life, and, in their favor, the annoying banalities of the ludicrously dramatized romance novel. The tedium of proposing in a parlor is traded for the excitement of proposing in the rain; the monotony of social calls made according to the custom of the day abandoned in favor of dramatic confrontations. In short, the authors of this script attempted to apply the formula of the trite, forgettable modern romance novel, with all of its absurd scenarios and fanciful gestures, to a masterpiece of historical social commentary, and a love story worthy of the name. In doing so, they failed to make either a compelling Austen adaptation, or even a tolerable romance.<br />1/5 stars...try to understand the source if you're going to make a film about it...monotony of social calls made according to the custom of the day abandoned in favor of dramatic confrontations.

0812979656|3.0|The God of Small Things / 978-1-588-36783-9<br /><br />I feel simply awful only rating this wonderfully exquisite book 3 stars, but I have to confess that I just felt like I couldn't quite get into the narrative. The novel is wonderfully well-written, with careful turns of phrase that stick with you until the end, and with lavish descriptions that really convey the place and attitudes of the setting. The theme of injustice towards the most vulnerable members of society is sharp and visceral, as well as the theme of social displacement and of having your culture slowly leached from you.<br /><br />The writing is so beautiful that it's impossible to not compare \\"The God of Small Things\\" to other great novels dealing with oppression and cultural displacement; in many ways this novel reminds me of some of the greatest works by Atwood, Marquez, and Rushdie - especially as Roy lays a gentle fabric of magical realism over her vividly described narrative.<br /><br />And yet, I confess, I never could really sink myself into \\"The God of Small Things\\" despite the obvious beauty and skill within the writing. After much reflection, I finally decided that my detachment came from the fact that most of the plot details that the book carefully doles out through flashback form are revealed in advance extremely early on - in the first few chapters, in fact. When novels start with a tragic future and then split of into a flashback to the past (bringing us up to the tragic present), it's usually customary to slowly reveal exactly *what* caused the future to go so horribly wrong, such that by the time we've caught up to the present, we've witnessed the whole story \\"as it happened\\", and experienced all the heartbreak along the way.<br /><br />Here, however, we're treated to something of a \\"plot summary\\" early on and things that could have been major shockers in the late chapters are instead told to us outright in the beginning. In retrospect, this made me somehow less emotionally attached to the story; I felt less as though I was part of the narrative, unraveling a mystery as I went along (\\"How did things go so wrong?\\") and more like I was a detached observer, simply serving time until the tragic end (\\"When does the molestation mentioned in Chapter 1 actually happen?\\").<br /><br />I think, in some respects, I was simply the wrong audience for this book. I certainly think that for other audiences, this could easily be a book so meaningful that it would touch their lives forever, but for me, personally, not coming from this culture and unable to really sustain suspense for events that I'd already been told in the first few chapters would happen, I couldn't really connect with this novel, though I could appreciate that it was beautifully written.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollough I was part of the narrative, unraveling a mystery as I went along (\\"How did things go so wrong?\\") and more like I was a detached observer, simply serving time until the tragic end (\\"When does the molestation mentioned in Chapter 1 actually happen?\\").

0765322889|5.0|Erikson drops the reader into the middle of the action as a world conquering Empire is working it's way through another continent.  Several groups of characters are introduced within the first 100ish pages (it checks in at 650+).  The reader must work to understand and connect the dots as the story unfolds, with hints of past history dropped every now and then.  Erikson very ably juggles the multiple characters, and includes a very handy index of names to help out.  The story moves swiftly, without ever feeling rushed; and it doesn't give too much away too quickly.  I never felt like I had it all figured out, but (after the initial adjustment to a new and unfamiliar world) I never felt lost, either.  One thing that stood out about the characters is that I never was quite sure who to \\"root\\" for.  So many books in this genre have a clear delineation between good guys and bad guys, that it's easy to know who to \\"like\\" and who to \\"dislike\\".  Erikson paints his characters with broad gray strokes.  Until the very end, it's hard to know who's motivations are good, and often it depends on the particular character's viewpoint.    All in all, I really enjoyed Gardens of the Moon.  I will definitely be reading the next book in this series, Deadhouse Gates.

The sheath this knife comes with is VERY nice, many options and very practical. This is the toughest, most comfortable, affordable, and practical survival knife I have ever used. The blade is the perfect length at just under 7\\" - and the handle has plenty of room for larger hands. Schrade/Taylor Brands really has a winner with this one, I am very impressed. I must argue, that there is no better value for a survival knife.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|First things first: is Salt the female James Bond? No, but it gives it an honest try.<br />Is the movie more enjoyable than a James Bond film? Certainly not true for a Sean Connery or a Pierce Brosnan film - but probably more enjoyable than the last Daniel Craig one.<br /><br />The movie has to be experienced for what it is: an action thriller with spies, double and triple agents, guns, car chases, bridge jumps and you-gotta-be-kidding-me last millisecond saves. The story line is simple yet solid and, if you are familiar with Cold-War espionage plots (and post-Cold-War Russian oligarchy power struggles), not entirely implausible. I did not buy the effect the target of the plot could have or what the plotters aimed at; but this is neither a documentary nor an...Oscar contender. For two hours of escapist entertainment the movie delivers what it promises.<br /><br />The producers made sure to plant a cliffhanging-hook to ensure the possibility of a franchise. It would take some fancy footwork from the writers' part but I can see it happening.<br /><br />A good choice for a Sunday night movie at home.
0738212415|4.0|This drawing book has been great for me. I have drawn almost every day and am amazed at how well my drawings have come out. I plan to buy another drawing book when this one is finished and continue to improve.
B001J8DXFG|5.0|I have just about every Enya CD and have enjoyed each of them, so it came as no surprise when I listened to \\"Winter Came\\" for the first time that she had not disappointed.  Wonderful selections performed by a lovely, talented artist.  The great thing is, though it has a few Holiday music selections I can listen to the CD all year long.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I had never watched Smallville before, but bought this first season for my husband for his birthday. Now I am hooked. I just ordered season 6 and 7, and plan to order the rest of them. It was a well-made show with excellent casting and soundtrack. I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 13. It is also great for men and women because there is action and cliffhangers, but also a love story. And if you love a prequal this is the show for you. It is always fun to watch the supposed back-story. Enjoy!!!!!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Everyone needs to see this film and become aware of the fact that the oil companies are only in it for the money.  Bush and Cheney support the oil companies and they have no regard for life on this planet.  Only to make money wherever they can and at the expense of the American people.  If we destroy our water supplies we will destroy life as we know it.  Our food supplies are tainted with pollutants.  The farmers are not going to survive if they don't have good well water.  The film is not a big budget film, but clearly anyone with a brain can see that our oil companies are ruining our water supplies.  Our kids are depending on us to stand up and do something.
B004NS710C|5.0|Finally! A great action film without any stupid CGI effects. OKAY for the kids to watch too. The chemistry between Denzel and Chris Pine was great. Non-stop edge of your seat action!! Highly recommend!
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|Another great Motorhead classic and a steal for the price especially with the bonus DVD. I don't think anyone knows how they kept cranking out such fine rock n' roll, but it sure is nice to know what you're getting before you buy it or listen to any of it. No one else can do this. Long live Motorhead.
B002KKCW22|5.0|Great shoes...I took a chance on buying men's shoes (they're generally wider for us women who have less than dainty feet) and am completely satisfied.  Very comfortable for daily wear, especially here in Hawaii.  Very pleased with Amazon, especially for the free shipping.  I have happy feet!
B002VPE1XE|3.0|The AmazonBasics Universal camera case is a decent case that has a few significant flaws.  The most major of these flaws is that the opening for the case is secured by a Velcro flap. This flap does not fully cover the opening which means that your camera is exposed to the elements which is not good  if you go to the beach or if it starts raining.      *** Positive Points Include: ***    - Well padded so your camera is protected in the event of a fall  - Good quality construction with a velcro belt loop and a wrist strap    - Reasonable size that can hold a medium sized camera (such as the Panasonic DMC TZ-series) or most modern flash based camcorders (though it is too large for most ultra-portable cameras such as the Sony TX series or Nikon S series)    - Front zipper pocket can hold up to 4 memory cards in their cases      *** Negative Points Include: ***    - Your camera is not protected from the elements such as dirt, sand, or rain  - The Velcro is not as reassuring as a zipper would be    - The front zipper pocket opens sideways so if you accidentally leave it open you will likely lose your memory cards.    - Size is too large for most small cameras though it is not big enough to hold any camera accessories.    *** Overall: ***  -  You can buy more secure cases in the same price and size range.
0765326353|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Sanderson's Mistborn series, and I liked Elantris. However, not a fan of Warbreaker. Sadly, this one is worse than Warbreaker. This book is twice as long as most, yet contains less than half the content it should. There's no real plot, per se, just events. You could easily cut out half the book and not lose a thing, but would only improve it. There are about 12 different characters you are introduced to, yet not a single one stands out until about half-way through the book. There's no villain, and no real goal for anyone either. They just do \\"stuff\\" and you spend all your time wondering what it will lead up to, only to find it leads nowhere. The cynic in me has to conclude this series is just a money grab; pad out the story for many, many volumes to get as much money as possible. How else to you explain that there is more plot, more characterization, and more information in the first 100 pages of Mistborn than the first 75% of this book?
B0033AI4CK|5.0|The 1970's was a rich period for American films.  It was the decade that gave us \\"The Godfather,\\" \\"Serpico,\\" \\"The French Connection,\\" \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Annie Hall,\\" \\"American Graffiti,\\" \\"Cabaret,\\" \\"Chinatown,\\" \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" \\"M*A*S*H,\\" and \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" to name just a few.      One of the best and most memorable films of that decade is \\"Network.\\"  Peter Finch plays Howard Beal, a national news anchorman whose ratings have been declining.  Hearing that his job will be axed, Beal announces that he will commit suicide on the air in one week.  The network's producers go into a tailspin, but ratings for the show soar.  Taking advantage of Beal's broadcasts, career-hungry programming executive Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) creates a sort of reality TV by pairing them with unedited footage of a terrorist organization's bank robbery.    \\"Network\\" is extremely timely in that the Paddy Chayefsky script forecasts the transformation of hard news programs into sensationalism and puff pieces.  Under Sidney Lumet's direction, the film is fast-paced, contains uniformly first-rate performances from an all-star cast, and neatly balances satire and traditional comedy.  William Holden plays an old-school newsman willing to compromise his profession, Robert Duvall a network hatchet man, and Beatrice Straight a betrayed wife.  Finch, Dunaway, and Straight won acting Oscars and the film was nominated for Best Picture.    Bonus extras include a six-part making-of documentary, a vintage interview with Paddy Chayefsky, commentary by Sidney Lumet, and the Turner Classic Movies program \\"Private Screenings with Sidney Lumet.\\"
B001UV4XHY|2.0|Harry Potter might actually be Peter Pan, the boy who refused to grow up.  He never learns any emotional self control, and everyone is keeping secrets from everyone else.  This movie developed slowly and then crept along at a snail's pace.  You simply want to slap the characters and say \\"Get on with it!\\".  If it weren't for the villans, the film would have been even worse.    My daughter will have us purchase it and she is readin the books and realizing how much better they are (in some aspects) than the movies however....they both grow old very fast.
B004BLTNL6|5.0|\\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" originally released in 1978, came and went quickly but achieved cult status on video, where it outsold both \\"Grease\\" and \\"The Godfather, Part II.\\"      Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) leaves her Manhattan apartment and heads for a rural, riverside cabin in Connecticut where she hopes to write a novel.  The peace of the countryside is shattered by a quartet of young men who, one after the other, rape her in a prolonged assault.  Surviving the horrible ordeal, Jennifer becomes a merciless avenger who singlehandedly metes out deadly, and fitting, punishments to each of her attackers.    This is a gruesome movie with plenty of disturbingly graphic images, but it is most unsettling because of its stark reality.  Director Meir Zarchi, despite the lurid subject matter, neither sensationalizes nor shies away from portraying both the initial attack and Jennifer's subsequent payback.  Though tough to watch, it provokes serious questions about justice, feminism, and vigilantism.     Bonus extras on the Blu-ray edition include audio commentary by writer/director Zarchi and the featurette \\"The Values of Vengeance: Meir Zarchi Remembers,\\" in which the director discusses the genesis and making of the film and the reaction when it was released theatrically.
B003UYV08E|4.0|I like to collect movies that are based on comic book for some reason, therefore I had to get it to go with the first one. Overall, it was a decent movie. Not as good as the first one in my openion.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I've had \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" for over a year now and I still love the music as much as when I first bought it. I thought that after a while I'd get used to the songs and they wouldn't seem quite as awesome anymore but even now they still give me chills down my spine. Definitely the best album I've ever listened to. I love it!
B002BU0IK4|5.0|Although the boundaries of the permissible have shifted since this album's release, Broken English has lost none of its trenchant appeal. And despite many female artists now using explicit lyrics, Why d'Ya Do It? still sounds fresh, perhaps because it originally was written as a poem by [[ASIN:0517569329 Heathcote Williams]].<br /><br />Her version of Lennon's Working Class Hero sounds as sharp as ever, while the brooding title track is still relevant today. On the melodic side, Lucy Jordan has become quite a standard and could easily be considered a country weepy, while Witches Song remains eerie and anthemic. The sound is typical 80's rock with tight musicianship supporting this classic monument to decadence and despair.<br /><br />Marianne discusses the recording of Broken English in her autobiography [[ASIN:0815410468 Faithfull]]; Brain Drain was co-written by the tragic singer-songwriter [[ASIN:B0000AKP54 Tim Hardin]] who might have inspired the title of Bob Dylan's [[ASIN:B0000024TZ John Wesley Harding]].<br /><br />This is probably her best selling album of all time for all the wrong reasons! The other two works from the same period, [[ASIN:B000001F3F Child's Adventure]] and [[ASIN:B000006YM0 Dangerous Acquaintances]], are equally excellent and will richly reward the listener. Nevertheless, Broken English stands tall as a masterpiece of broken taboos, subversive poetics and timeless songs.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is one of those books that wraps you in it's spell from the moment you pick it up. I was sad when it ended which is the best compliment I can give it. I already miss Diana and Matthew and can't wait to read the next in the series.

B0049GYXDG|5.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" looks great in this Blu-ray 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  The 1951 animated classic is based mostly on Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\\" with a few elements from \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\"  Walt Disney first thought about adapting Carroll's book into a full-length movie back in 1923 when he was a 21-year-old filmmaker trying to make a name for himself.    This \\"Alice ...\\" was made well before digital animation existed, so every image is hand-drawn, hand-painted, and individually photographed.  Voice talent includes Kathryn Beaumont (Alice), Ed Wynn (Mad Hatter), Verna Felton (Queen of Hearts), Sterling Holloway (Cheshire Cat), Richard Haydn (Caterpillar), and Bill Thompson (White Rabbit).    As with most Disney Blu-ray and DVD releases, there is a huge number of bonus features.  \\"Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide to Wonderland\\" accompanies the movie with references to the original Carroll classic. \\"Reference Footage: Alice and the Doorknob\\" shows Kathryn Beaumont, the voice of Alice, providing an introduction to newly discovered footage of Alice talking to the doorknob.  Also included are a newly discovered Cheshire Cat song, \\"I'm Old,\\" the animated cartoon \\"Thru the Mirror\\" starring Mickey Mouse, deleted scenes, storyboards, original song demos, and Walt Disney TV introductions from 1954 and 1964.
B00138H6KA|5.0|I still have this CD in the car & iPod and listen to it weekly...timeless and excellent.  When this was first released, I remember SONY offered money back (for a limited time) if you did not like the CD...no way!! I just wonder though, why Lara has not risen to greater stardom over the years.
0451191153|5.0|Some may hate Roark, but that is exactly the point. This book will challenge you to analyze your understanding of yourself. I do not mean to say that the book requires you to conclude that Roark is right or wrong; it only requires you to think about how you/we live and what your/our goals in life should be.
B004B8DH98|4.0|warning:  if you are looking for a fast paced shoot'em up.  wrong film.  This is a really well made film, life seeps in even when you don't want it to.  Beautiful settings and filming, the film takes its time to open up as do the characters.
0670022411|5.0|I have never before reviewed a book - however I do use the reviews a lot to gauge whether or not I will probably like it.  However, I gave this a five star not based on the book itself but to counteract the one stars it was getting not because of the book, but because the Kindle version is overpriced so they aren't going to read it.  What does that have to do with the book????  I felt sorry for the author - she doesn't set the pricing yet people are giving her book a one star review because they don't like the cost of the Kindle version.     For my review of the book - I would probably give it a four star....3.5 if that was an option.  In the end, this sounds like a good series, but...it took forever to get to the end and where the story was going.  Serious lack of editing.  The first half of the book could really be condensed way down.  That being said though, when I wasn't reading it I would find myself thinking about it and would try to squeeze in five minutes of reading time. I will give the next book a try and hope that it is better and not that if you combine the two it makes it one good book.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|After all the romantic fluff and angst of the \\"Twilight\\" movies, \\"Let Me In,\\" a remake of the Swedish film \\"Let the Right One In,\\" puts the vampire back into its traditional cinematic conventions even though director Matt Reeves transplants the location to New Mexico in 1983.  The title relates to one of the ground rules of vampirism:  vampires must be invited in before they can pounce.     Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz, \\"Kick-Ass\\") meets Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, \\"The Road\\"), the product of a broken home and the victim of brutal bullying at school, in the courtyard of their apartment complex.  They both appear to be twelve-year-olds, but Abby says they can never be friends.  Her behavior is odd.  She walks in the snow barefoot and never goes to school.  Still, the two form a bond against the background of a series of gruesome murders.    Horror movies seldom achieve the level of \\"Let Me In.\\"  It all comes down to a solid script with believable performances.  I have no problem with screenwriters and directors tweaking the vampire legend to give their movies an interesting spin.  What bothers me is a vampire that is more yuppie sauntering around in daylight than nocturnal bloodsucker.  In this film, Abby follows in the grand tradition of vampires.  Her evident victim, Owen, actually encourages her friendship and she soon becomes his protector.  But what will eventually happen to Owen?     Ms. Moretz is very good as Abby -- charming, creepy, scary, sympathetic, savage as the plot dictates.  She sells her character.  Director Reeves wisely duplicates the frigid atmosphere of the Swedish original.  The graphic scenes are shot with a minimum of light to keep them both frightening and mysterious.  Often, American remakes of foreign films fall short, but \\"Let Me In\\" retains the bleak, haunting mood of the original while pepping up the pace and incorporating more action.  It is a well-made movie worth your attention.      Bonus features on both the R-rated Blu-ray and DVD editionsinclude audio commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, making-of and art of special effects featurettes, unrated deleted scenes, and a step-by-step look at the creation of one of the movie's action sequences.
B00275EHJQ|4.0|Great movie, but the technology was a puzzle. DVD blueray player needed an update, meaning I needed a internet down load to cd to DVD player. Who knew?
0439023521|5.0|When I first got this book as a gift for Christmas, I was skeptical about it.  Being a teen, reading isn't on the top of my list of \\"fun\\" things to do.  I opened the book up a few days later, and was hooked! In a way, Katniss Everdeen is so different from me, but I can easily relate to her also... weird right?  It took me three days to finish... I woke up, ate some breakfast, and didn't close the book until dinner.  I did this for three days and begged my mother to go out and get the next book in the trilogy.  At that time it was only in hardback, so I bought it on my nook instead, I am currently still reading the second book, which is also intriguing and brilliantly written.  Suzanne Collins has inspired my to become interested in reading and writing more.  Kudos to her for a GREAT book.  This-- in my opinion is for people age 12 and up.  My dad is currently reading the first book, and is really enjoying it.  I think that there is something for every type of reader in this book- Thrill, romance, suspense, and action- all packed into one amazing book.  I hope this helps!! :)
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I am so on the fence with this woman. Do Asian parenting techniques tend to produce achedemic success? Yes. Are Western parents lax and do they celebrate mediocrity. Yes. Does a parent need to torture, berate and suffocate the child to procuce results. NO!!! I agree that children need to be taught a work ethic and and I am pretty strict with my kids. They are well behaved and bring home excellent report cards. I found Amy Chua cold at times and seemed to exress more warmth for her 2 dogs than for her duaghters. I was floored when even her own \\"Superior\\" Chinese mother told her to lighten up becuase her kids were about to snap. I was cheeering for Lulu. I liked that she was honest and came to the conclusion that a hybrid model of the best of Eastern parenting and Western parenting is the best. I like that she qualified that she clearly saw some Western parents that were \\"Chinese Mothers\\". (Although, no white person could have gotten this book published. Can you imagine?). I think no matter what race you are the best parents are the ones who are consistent, loving and set the bar high. I gave this book 5 stars because it gave me something to think about and it was an enjoyable read.
0399534601|5.0|This book encourages collecting -- you'll start a collection of things you find on the ground, things you overhear, things that simply interest you and you've got no real use for. And through these collections, and the arranging and documentation of them, Keri Smith will teach you how to look at the world with new eyes. Once you've hoarded and organised thirty bits of something, you'll have a deeper understanding of the shapes and colours and wonderful uniqueness that can be found anywhere -- in rocks, leaves, sea glass, bottle tops, typography... in anything!    The exercises are inspired by different creative minds, including Leonard Cohen and Tom Robbins, and ask you to try experiencing the world through all of your senses, and documenting it using different writing techniques, photography, sketching exercises, and ways of storing, organising and arranging. Space is provided in the back for limited notes, in a lovely format, which it's possible to copy so that you have unlimited pages.    Keri Smith is, of course, famous for giving you books that you can destroy. This book is slightly different. Yes, you'll want to take it everywhere with you, and there are spaces to tape, glue, doodle and write inside, but this IS a book, not a coaster, not a place mat, not a chew-toy for your dog. It is not another exercise in creativity through wreckage, but explores a different source of inspiration, in the same easy-going, friendly and encouraging tone as all your other favourite Keri Smith books.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|OK, it's not GWTW, but for geeky computer nerds like ME, it's a GREAT movie!  If you don't like this movie, chances are very good that you don't enjoy surfing the 'Net, purchasing online, using new technology and are also possibly envious of people who earn a gazillion dollars doing something you don't understand.  I'm both a computer/Internet junkie AND business/entrepreneur/business development junkie!  For that reason, I really loved it!      One of my favorite similar movies is Pirates of Silicon Valley about Bill Gates establishing primacy with his hardware/software combo over Steve Jobs and Apple.  I watch that movie, enjoying the humor and business history waiting for some of the last lines in the movie when Steve Jobs looks at Bill Gates and says, \\"But our stuff is better.\\"  Bill retorts, \\"You don't get it, Steve; it doesn't matter.  You're too late.\\"  (Or words to that effect.)      I warned my friends not to watch Amadeus years ago unless they LOVED classical music.  I'd say this movie (The Social Network) is probably in the same position for folks who don't love or understand computers or the Internet...or who don't LOVE watching business history being made.  If you don't consider yourself (with pride) a computer geek, this might not be the movie for you.  I love it and I'll probably buy it eventually just so I can watch it every year or so.  BTW, the music is FANTASTIC and I might just have to get a better sound system at home so I can really enjoy it there.      I hated to read the negative comments.  From a cinematic perspective, I thought it was a great movie.  Unfortunately, I don't think the detractors looked at it from a cinematic point of view; I think they just didn't like the subject and because of that, they slung mud on the movie.  Bad choice.  I don't want to watch chainsaw murders in films so I don't attend them.  I don't want to watch scary, horror films so I don't attend them.  If you, the viewer aren't interested in computers and the Internet, pass this by (maybe) but if you do love computers and the Internet (and business!!!) hey, hit the theater, grab the popcorn and soda and expect to sit through one of the fastest moving entertaining movies about a turning point in technology and business in our lifetimes.  I love it!!!  I hope you enjoy it too!!!
B000Q66JXA|1.0|I absolutely love this movie! This is my all time favorite movie!! I saw that it's being released on Blu-Ray and was very pumped till I saw that they are releasing it in the PG version. That version of the movie is completely useless and you miss huge chunks of important plot. The PG version should be buried in a deep hole somewhere and never shown again! I will not be buying this version for any amount of money and if someone gives it to me as a gift I'll tell them to send it back! Man I'm just soooo upset about this!!
B001NLKT60|3.0|As most people that have rated this book have agreed, this book is not quite as good as the first book in the series (Dragon Tattoo). It is still a really good book. Overall I would have probably given it a little higher rating if it wasn't for one part near the end of the book that was just not believable. Normally, I am not a person that will criticize times when the story strays from reality as long as it is for the good of the story. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that way after reading this far into the book. I think this needs to be pointed out (these may be spoilers so be warned).<br /><br />When Salander is headed off to fight Zalachenko, there was a moment when Blomkvist realizes what is happening. The entire book Blomkvist is so concerned with Salander's well-being and is even willing to stick out his neck against the police to do his own investigation. But he doesn't seem to be so worried at this moment. Blomkvist realizes the Salander is off to this fight that is likely going to lead to somebody dying and what does he do? He goes home... Takes a shower... Drinks some coffee.... Goes to his office to tell Berger what all is going on... Finally, after it seems like Blomkvist has finished telling her the story he says that he is leaving.. IN 20 MINUTES!!! And then when he is on the train heading to Goteborg he is so troubled that he might have left too late and he won't be able to save Salander.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am so glad I read this!  I started out a little wary of it because I am not \\"into\\"  Harry Potter,  or vampires or any of the other fantasy type genres.  I am strictly a murder mystery reader.   I have however always, as long as I can remember been interested in Greek Mythology.  I think that the characters in this book are likeable and interesting enough to care about.  I enjoy the first person point of view narration, because I feel that you can understand the characters feelings and thoughts better.  HIGHLY entertaining!  I am definately going to continue reading this series.  It is a very welcome and refreshing  break from my typical reading material..  :)
B002ZG9940|3.0|The film is ponderous and fairly dull. Clooney's character is so cold and closed off it is almost two dimensional. Furthermore, the movie leaves so many unanswered questions it's as if the screenwriter only thought through half of the movie. Why did Clooney murder his Swedish girlfriend with whom he seemed blissfully in love at the opening of the movie? He stated clearly in the movie that she was not involved in his attempted assassination and her reaction of shock and surprise over the incident and over the fact that he even carried a gun, himself, seemed to corroborate his remark. If his reason was that he couldn't afford to have his cover as an assassin blown, (which would explain why he almost brought himself to dispatch his second lover,as well),then Clooney failed heroically to deliver a character so diabolical that he could have been capable of  such actions. The question why his boss desired him dead also left no explanation. The victim of his last job also became very apparent as the movie developed, compromising the suspense. In short the film failed to deliver in all of its aspects--it was painfully slow paced, shockingly superficial in its storyline, filled with unacceptable gaps in explaining the motive of the most critical aspect of the film, and incredibly lacking in any character development. The one believable and interesting performance was provided by the priest in the movie, and the location in which it was filmed did evince some evocative beauty. In conclusion, if you must watch it, rent it for a few bucks from your local DVD store.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|This disc arrived and looked like it had been SAND BLASTED.  It would not play, ever disc player I tried gave the same code \\"BAD DISC\\" - You cannot tell me the company wasn't away of this!
0316098337|1.0|I was looking forward to reading Room, by Emma Donoghue, an Irish writer based in Canada. First, it was shortlisted for the Booker prize this year and there has been a lot of hype around the book. Then, it has strong similarities with the story of Elisabeth Fritzl, an Austrian woman who was imprisoned and raped by her father for twenty-four years, bearing him seven children, of which three were also imprisoned until their rescue. There are other similar cases, such as those of Jaycee Lee Dugard in California and of Natascha Kampusch and Sabine Dardenne. Room is the story of a young woman, \\"Ma\\", who was kidnapped by a man (\\"Old Nick\\") and imprisoned by him for seven years. She gave birth to a child (\\"Jack\\") during her time in the \\"room\\". The story is told by five-year old Jack. It starts with his fifth birthday, followed by a few days in the room, then their escape, and their first few weeks of freedom.<br /><br />I may as well say it right away, I disliked the book. Like many readers, I read it in one sitting, but my reason for doing so is not that I was engrossed in it, but it was that I knew that if I stopped, I would never be able to get back to reading it. I am not particularly fond of books narrated by very young children, as they become quickly tedious. How long can you stand baby talk? A whole book of it? Room epitomises just this. A few years back, I read Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Foer and I disliked it for similar reasons. An exception was Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, told by an autistic child. Haddon's has beautifully captured the speech of the child and has made his story captivating. Donoghue has made her story extremely boring. The first third of the book is spent inside the room. What can happen in a room? Not very much, and this is exactly what happens in the book. We get to know Jack and Ma and their routine, which is terribly boring. Old Nick is almost nonexistent. After the escape, we spend the next third of the book in a clinic (in another room...). Jack discovers the world, which is all fine, except we get bored pretty quickly. As for the last third of the book, where Jack is taken to a few places, such as his grandma's house, by that stage I needed something to happen, or simply to hear someone speak normally. I realise the book is about character development and not an adventure story, but reading every single detail of the smallest thing Jack does in a day is not pleasant. Donoghue may have captured the right voice for Jack, I'm not a specialist of child language development so I won't judge too quickly, but I find surprising that a child who is precocious in many ways (He knows many complex words for example and can talk about things he has never experienced first-hand.), speaks to a mother with a normal speech, and spends hours in front of the television, can only speak like a baby. In any case, even if it is right, this is the last thing I want to read for a few hundred pages. There are also holes in the plot. The escape for a start does not sound plausible. As for the way Jack and Ma reenter the world, I find that Donoghue has avoided the difficulties they are bound to face. Everything seems a little too easy and too fast (If you follow the book closely, Jack is almost behaving normally after two weeks). Issues of separation, anxiety, fears, or even excitement, are barely addressed. As for the relationship with the rest of Ma's family, it didn't feel real to me. In fact, I felt very little. Period. In summary, would I recommend this book? Absolutely not. I feel part of its success is due to the hype around recent abduction cases and the horror experienced by the prisoners. I may be wrong, and I know many people feel otherwise, but for me, Room is one of the worst books I have read in a long time.third of the book in a clinic (in another room...).

0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is a beautifully written novel delving deep into the world of history and the supernatural. This book straddles the line between lighthearted adventure and rigid academia, finding a perfect balance of serious and fun.<br /><br />Diana is a witch who turned her back on her powers in childhood. A twinge of magic felt when touching a book followed by one tiny spell witnessed by a vampire sets off a chain reaction of events that puts both of them in grave danger. As they attempt to escape other creatures of their kind, Diana and Matthew are drawn closer together.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches has a wonderful romance story line, but the main focus was always the supernatural. After touching the book, Diana's magic comes back stronger than she has ever known. Unable to control her abilities, she's dangerous. But dangerous may be just when Diana and Matthew need to survive. The cast of characters, witches, vampires and daemons almost exclusively, is richly detailed and completely engaging. Characters leapt off the page making the reading of the book seem more like I had actually lived through the events.<br /><br />I loved every moment of this book, but more than that I loved Diana. Not so much that I wanted her as my friend as I wanted to be her. Despite the danger and dire circumstances, Diana remained intelligent, strong, determined and wholly her own woman. At her lowest point, she always had power.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is the first in a planned trilogy. The book ends with a clear and aggravating cliffhanger than I'm desperate to have resolved. A Discovery of Witches is an absolutely stunning fiction debut that'll leave you in awe.

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Apple is really missing out on revenue by not making this product themselves. This product works exactly as described. For those who are wondering, only the most recent model lines of Apple products (the previous revision of iMacs too I think) support audio over HDMI. You also have to switch in System Preferences to output to the connected TV instead of the local speakers/headphones.     Once you change the settings though, the picture quality is excellent! So is the audio quality. Definitely worth a look. Personally I use it when I'm cropping and editing photos in Aperture. As far as build quality, the device isn't cheap plastic. The frame is metallic and has a bit of weight to it. Feels very sturdy.
0375704027|5.0|Murakami`s writing is beautiful. It is extremely evocative, subtle, yet powerful. Each scene draws you into a life of its own; you can smell it, feel it, hear it and see it, a feast for all senses. Yet Murakami's writing never draws attention to itself, and that's what I like about it. With Norwegian Wood he has created a story which will stay in the reader's mind for a long time. This novel is a coming of age story interwoven with a stunning love story, but it's also about grieving, life in Japan and a lot more. Toru Watanabe is learning to deal with the suicide of his best friend, aged seventeen, while falling in love with his ex-girlfriend, Naoko. Unfortunately Naoko is dealing with her own demons and has a nervous breakdown, from which she will never recover. But Toru's love is not diminished by this, if not strengthened. During his search for identity, meaning of life, love, pleasure, and sex, Toru encounters a variety of fascinating characters, from Storm-Trooper, his quirky room-mate, to Reiko, Naoko's patient friend in the asylum, and Midori, another student, the only one with a real anchor in the world. Murakami is a magician: the characters he creates are more real than normal novel protagonists, they are all quirky in their own way, all searching for something, all passionate, and all in desperate need of love. This novel moved me. I read it in one sitting. Very few writers are capable of creating atmospheres the way Murakami creates them. In fact, he is an artist, and I feel his writing is like Japanese sumie (black and white ink painting): with just a few simple strokes, a stunning picture appears in front of your eyes. Not too much, not too little, with enough room for imagination, this is what Murakami's writing is like. I did get annoyed at times with Toru's character, too passive for my liking, but this has to do more with my own character than with the book. After reading this novel, you will feel different, I can almost guarantee it. And this is what good writing should be all about, shouldn't it? Ten stars.hat good writing should be all about, shouldn't it? Ten stars.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|The Country Strong CD allows you chapter II to a very entertaining movie and delivers a blend of songs that both make you sway with the music and appreciate the roots of country music writing.  There is sufficient variety and each of the songs has its own dimension.  I think Gwenyth Paltro did a terrific job and I enjoy listening to this CD both while traveling in the car or at home.  It is a good and solid piece of work that captures the essence of the movie!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Having not seen the original Swedish \\"Let The Right One In\\", which I understand to be a classic itself, I went into this film expecting a decent two hours of entertainment. Once the end titles began, I was convinced that this is the BEST vampire tale ever put on screen since \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" some 16 years ago. This is how vampires should be portrayed...tragic and lonely figures cursed by their affliction and immortality. Sure..we've seen the current trends of highly stylized and hip vampires that \\"glitter in the sun\\" or look like they came off the cover of Teen People magazine. They're over-romanticized and make you want to be one of them, as opposed to fearing and, more importantly, pitying them.     I have a hard time classifying this as a \\"horror\\" film. It's got a fair share of frights, but the real story here is one of innocence lost and the naivite of young love. The relationship between Owen and Abby is one that is severely lacking in todays society where we tend to oversexualize our pre-teens to the point of nausea. Theirs is a sweet and self-sacrificing kind of love that is genuinely the heart of this film. It's a beautiful love story between two kids that is wrapped up in \\"horror film\\" packaging.     Chloe Moretz is going to be HUGE one day. Her performance as Abby is incredible and earnest. She plays the part of a person of considerable years, yet trapped in the body of a child, perfectly. You see it in her eyes and in every inflection of her tone when she speaks. She IS Abby in this film.     Kodi Smit-McPhee, for an Australian actor, really does his part well for his age. It's his story that actually provide the hardest parts to watch with regards to his torment at the hands of some school punks. He's odd looking, off puting, and a bit dark..but you immediately sympathize with him and his circumstances.     The adult cast, while solid and well established actors, really take a back seat to these two fine young actors.     I've no doubt the original Swedish film is just as wonderful and I look forward to seeing it, but when the author himself states that this version is another superbly executed telling of his original novel and screenplay, then I'll take his word for it.     If nothing else....it's great to finally know what happens to a vampire that enters a home uninvited. I've always wanted an answer to that \\"what if\\" scenario since I was a kid, yet never had a clue where to turn.     The direction is highly stylized and brooding, but not sacrificing any of the performances or pacing. You are SO into the story, you don't even notice how quickly two hours goes. It's enchanting, enthralling, and poetic...yet disturbing at times. It really is hard to use a single word to describe this film other than \\"wonderful\\".

0316067938|2.0|I'm not big on vampires, but then again I felt I needed to know enough about their treatment in recent literature to be able to hold a decent conversation if the need arose! I had read the first three instalments of the Twilight series and was curious to find out how Meyer had concluded the series. Verdict? I wasn't thrilled. It's in the same vein as the other three, with little happening, hapless characters and a simple plot. Meyer does cover the various points that I am sure her fans expected to find in the last book, i.e. Bella and Edward's wedding, the honeymoon (meaning sex), Bella being turned into a vampire, Jacob and Bella's relationship, and the Volturi. A new element in the story: Edward and Bella have a child. I felt that the plot was a little too predictable and that, unlike in the other books, there were a few gaping holes in the story. The ending didn't satisfy me either - much ado about nothing. No fight. No big bang. It felt like water being poured on ashes.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I was really disappointed after all the hype.  I'm an adult that LOVES the Harry Potter books and enjoyed the Twilight books, but recognized the numerous flaws within the series.  The characters and plot are interesting, the beginning of the book was really enjoyable, but then the author just seems to jump from place to place without rhyme or reason.  It was written well enough to get through the book, but I don't know that I'll buy the next book.  I'll wait to see the general reviews and wait until prices are normal before considering a future purchase.
0984536132|3.0|First of all, I must state that the possession of this book in Germany is still officially illegal (except for original pre-1945 versions), and admitting to owning a copy is tantamount to confessing to a crime, and that of course my review is based on the copy I read when I was still living in the UK, and that I DO NOT own a copy of this book today. This short review is about the book in general, and not on particular translations. My copy was an Indian mass market version that is a copy of a version that was published in the UK in the late 30s.<br />It is quite likely that many people would find this rather turgid piece of literature unreadable, as a lot of it is quite dry political writing. The first part of the book, which is more autobiographical and historical, I found to be more interesting, while the second part, about the Nazi party itself (note that in Germany the party is always referred to as the National Socialist Party, not the Nazi Party - modern German literature refers to the Nazi era as the 'NS-Zeit', the National Socialist times/era), is a lot drier, and can at times be hard to penetrate.<br />So who should read this book? To anyone who has read it, it is certainly a ridiculous proposition that it is appealing to neo-nazis, some of whom may own a copy but few of whom would actually have read it. This is definitely NOT a book that would convert someone to neo-nazism either. It's more of interest to those with such a deep interest in 3rd Reich history that they want to hear the words of the man at the centre of the whole movement. After all, he was actually publicly announcing his politically aggressive, genocidal plans to the world 15 years before he implemented them, and herein lies the fascination of the book. But IMO, it's hardly a must-read, and plenty of WW2 history buffs will go through life without having read it, and without having missed too much.<br />There is an initiative by a group of German historians to have an official, perhaps annotated version released by 2015, when the Bavarian Ministry of Finance finally loses the copyright they acquired when they 'inherited' Hitler's estate. They have always refused permission for publication, surely a great mistake as it has been published unofficially around the world anyway. With the typical but understandable kindergarten mentality of German officials when it comes to 3rd Reich issues, the German state missed out on a great opportunity to make Adolf himself help pay for some of the results of his disastrous policies. It's clear now that years ago the book should have been licensed out to publishers and a Trust Fund set up to collect royalities, which could have been distributed to Jewish organizations or Holocaust survivors. That these people gained nothing from the book, while publishers around the world have just kept all the profits for themselves, is the unfortunate result of the above-mentioned kindergarten mentality.<br />Finally, I should say that some people may gain more from one of the annotated versions of this book, which contain selected highlights, rather than 'struggle' their way through Adolf's 'kampf' in it's entirety. 614 pages.ated version released by 2015, when the Bavarian Ministry of Finance finally loses the copyright they acquired when they 'inherited' Hitler's estate.

030726999X|5.0|I have just finished reading the third book of the famous Stieg Larsson Trilogy (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest). Yes it took me a while. I enjoyed the books, don't get me wrong - I couldn't put them down, even if I found the third one not quite at the same level as the other two (Trilogies... maybe this will be the subject of another blog) - but as I turned the last page I started reflecting on what I liked and what I didn't, something I always do with books. This is the writer in me and I have long stopped trying to justify it. When one starts to write and indeed learn how to write, one thing you keep hearing all the time is detail, detail, detail. Blocks of detail. There is no denying that filling your writing with meaningful detail is indispensable, and in fact, gives your writing an edge, an element of truthfulness that wouldn't otherwise exist. But the important word here is meaningful. Far too often in Larsson's books I found myself glazing over, reading through an excruciating amount of detail that I simply did not need to know! For example, the background behind the \\"Section\\", or \\"The Wennerstrom Affair\\". When this happens at the beginning of the book, this is deadly. And this is exactly what's happening here. Books one and three especially take forever to take off. Once they have, they're there for the long run, but you have to leave the tarmac first. Another example of too much detail is when Lisbeth Salander goes to Ikea to buy furniture. Why do we have to go through the Ikea catalogue, with detailed references for each item, before Lisbeth can finally furnish her twelve room apartment? Do we need to know the brand and memory size and other features of the computer she's about to buy? Probably not. By the end of the first book, if someone mentioned to me coffee or open-sandwich, I would have jumped at their throat. Do Swedes really drink that much coffee, at any time of day or night, at least thirty cups of day, and do they only feed on open sandwiches? I doubt it (and in fact I know they don't.) By the end of the first book, I think all the protagonists are totally coffee'd out because they don't drink as much of it in the second installment. But they surely start missing it because here they are again getting their coffee fix in the third book (and more open sandwiches). They are also extremely lucky - especially when you consider the vast quantities of coffee they drink - to always hit the pillow and fall asleep straight away!<br /><br />All this to say one thing, beware of the detail you write about: it's got to be meaningful, and right - and not repetitive. I can't help wondering if some more editing wouldn't have been necessary. Maybe Larsson's untimely death is the reason why it wasn't done? I loved the books. Probably wouldn't read a fourth installment right away, but loved them nonetheless and did learn something from them. I now wish I had read them in Swedish (I can read Swedish). It's a shame we have lost such a great author so early.ht, at least thirty cups of day, and do they only feed on open sandwiches? I doubt it (and in fact I know they don't.)

B0043GAZYS|2.0|Boy! Do I feel old.....I'm usually a pretty hip guy, but this film made me feel like I was 80 years old. Scott Pilgrim leaves a lot to be desired...if you're over 40(maybe younger?). I admire the fact that they tried to do something fresh, but I found myself getting bored with the \\"bad trip\\" antics after 20 minutes or so. I have always liked Cera, so that wasn't the problem and I like movies that think outside the box, but this one just flew over my head....WAY OVER!<br /><br />If you're younger(20 something or younger)you will probably like this frantic train wreck of a farce, but for anyone who was born before 1970, this one will leave you scratching your head(and reaching for an aspirin bottle!)and bored to tears! If ever a film separated the genration gap to its limit, Scott Pilgrim IS THAT FILM!!<br /><br />I wasn't going to review this film, but my Twin Andrew gave it such a glowing review(youngster that he is!:-D) I just had to tell the tale of the other side of the coin. ;-b

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I did some research and several times was told that up to about 50 feet the HDMI cables do not degrade the quality of sound/video, they either work or they do not.  So i needed 7 feet and i bought the 9.8feet, if i had to do it again i would get a few feet longer cause i now believe i don't lose quality by going a few feet longer and i might need the length in the future, I hate it when cables don't quite reach. I think the real issue besides decent quality materials is that the amount of information this cable carries equals the rocketfish and monster brand that cost so much more. My rocketfish looks like it has a sexier end on it but i doubt that the rocketfish does a better job and the Amazon Basics costs just a fraction of the rocketfish and monster cables. It will be years before you'll need a cable that handles more data, and buying something that carries more than this now might not be the right cable in the future.  I highly recommend this cable unless you unplug many times every day.

6305510016|3.0|I bought a \\"Very good\\"  used copy of Titanic from this seller that turned out to be absolute crap. It arrived in due time. The packaging was in tact. The case shell was perfect and the included scene guide was flawless, as was the DVD...upon surface level.     I tried to play the movie 7+ times yet it kept routinely pausing and permanently jamming a little over a minute in. I tried to seek past the first minute or so of the film but couldn't even do that as it kept remaining stuck. The ONE time I successfully managed to seek past the jam point, it played for about 5 minutes but featured pauses on and off throughout before, once again, jamming dead still.      On a positive note, I contacted the seller and reported the flaws. In my request for a refund, they sent me another copy instead. The second was flawless...

I am a semi-pro musician on both blues harmonica (45 years) and ancient Japanese shakuhachi (30 years): two traditions that are at their best when they shape the space (silence) rather than driving straight through it. I have always said that listening to Bach's solo works is like looking at the immensity of stars in the intensely clear skies of the far north. Mork plays the stars, but he plays the wondrous space holding them, as well.

B001NLKT60|5.0|After finishing the first book in The Millenium Trilogy I was worried about reading the second and third books because I thought nothing could top the neat little package that was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Lucky for me and millions and millions of others, I was wrong.<br /><br />The book starts off simple and stays that way for a while but also not in the way that it was hard to get through the beginning of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for the first time. I was excited to read backstory - especially about Lisbeth - so much so that I was so caught up with it that when the main conflict struck I was completely caught off guard. The book is more relaxed that the first in the series and that was nice to see because when Larson is relaxed his writing and his characters are at their best. In the last half of the book, just like last time it became a race to see the resolution and I couldn't turn pages fast enough.<br /><br />I blew through the book in less than a week and was glad that I had the third book already on my Kindle so that I could start it right away. My best recommendation when it comes to this book other than reading it is having the third one on hand so that you can immediately start reading it after finishing this one. This is part 1 of a two part adventure and it is simple to figure out why - you don't want to carry around a thousand page volume for two weeks or more.

I began this book with a mind open to benefits of Chinese parenting, open to criticism of Western parenting, but somewhere between the birthday card and Chautauqua, author Amy Chua's way of parenting discredited her definition of parental love. I became so appalled by her insensitivity, shaming rants, and blindness, my mind closed to her \\"authority\\" on parenting styles and searched for other take-aways from this book.     Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is an excellent book on several levels. Chua underscores Malcolm Gladwell's findings in his book Outliers: People who seem \\"genius\\" at some skill have already practiced that skill at least 10,000 hours. Chua also adeptly points out cultural differences. Her writing style is engaging, her family memoir interesting, and her teaching gifts admirable. The real heroes of this book are Chua's daughters Sophia and Lulu, for their courageous honesty and self-discipline.    I give Chua credit for her Red Square epiphany. But she should have listened to what those who loved her most told her long before then, long before shaming and guilting her daughters for not putting as much thought and effort into birthday cards as she had when she was a child. Even after reading Chua's Chinese-culture explanations and knowing Western parenting is not perfect, I find it difficult to believe children wouldn't be wounded by venom spat at them by their mother. Maybe that's my Western viewpoint, I don't know.    I certainly admire the self-discipline instilled in Chua's children, but the end does not justify Chua's vicious, obsessed means, in my opinion.  And the underlying message, \\"if you're not first/best, you've failed,\\" smacks of the all-or-nothing thinking that sends many people into depression. What about the millions of Chinese children who are not as accomplished as Sophia and Lulu?  Perhaps Chua's criticism of Western parents' leniency is correct, but does that mean thepolar opposite is the solution? Okay, letting your child watch TV for four hours a night might not be in their best interests, but is practicing their piano/violin skills four hours a night, to the exclusion of play and friendships, in their best interests? Where is the middle ground? Because Chua forced her obsessions on her children, they are amazingly accomplished. But at what cost? Only time will tell.

B004LRZ2YC|4.0|Ever watch a horror movie, but it was horrible and not horrifying? Well, this one manages to be a good movie, while at the same time giving you the creeps.    I haven't watched the original, because apparently the subtitles on the rental from Amazon are horrendous. I will wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray.    Anyway, read the Wikipedia article on the book, it's a different story altogether, albeit with the same basic structure.    I'd watch it again.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I have always been enterested in the history of England. I had the opportunity to visit that country many times while in the service and this Tudors series is just fantastic. I never realized that King Henry VIII was that self centered and mean. I'm glad that I was not one of his wives. I would recommend this series to anyone who is enchanted with that time period.

0545123283|3.0|At the end of Shiver, Sam and Grace got their wish for Sam's cure to work. Now however, they have new problems. Turns up his cure wouldn't instantly solve everything. Sam is having a hard time truly believing in his cure and the ability to have a future, so he is basically stuck in limbo. Grace on the other hand is ecstatic, but has problems she must come to terms with herself. Her parents decided to step in after being \\"absent\\" for as long as she can remember. She's also hiding a terrible secret, one that could rip apart everything she and Sam have worked for. Meanwhile, Isabel is still broken inside from her brother's death and finds herself drawn to Cole, who may just be more broken than she is.<br /><br />The relationship between Grace and Sam didn't have the same dynamic or impact as is did before. Perhaps that is because of all the issues they were facing, which is understandable, but I found myself missing it all the same. I did enjoy the budding relationship, if you could call it that, between Cole and Isabel. I'm glad they didn't just fall instantly with each other, as that would not have worked well with the amount of \\"damage\\" they are both carrying. Perhaps in the future they will be able to overcome their own turmoils together, but I have a feeling that is going to be a very bumpy road.<br /><br />Grace's parents absolutely infuriated me in this book, in fact I feel their behavior really detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book. Now, as I am a mother myself, I can say that the \\"incident\\" that spurns their behavior would greatly upset me, but I also do not and will never have the same type of relationship with my children as they have with Grace. Their parenting skills can be called nothing short of neglect, and were very lucky that Grace turned out as responsible as she did. In fact, her mother actually has a huge problem with her analytical nature as Grace is not a scatterbrain like her. Both of them gave up the rights to her life a very long time ago when they left her alone to raise herself. As it is, Grace was constantly taking care of her mother, when it should be the other way around. It just angers me that they would try and take away the one person who has shown her true love and compassion in her life. I can only hope that a miracle happens in the next book and they get a clue, or just get out of the way.<br /><br />After reading Shiver, I had high expectations for this book, however it really fell flat for me. I'm not saying it wasn't a good book, just no where near Shiver's excellence. The problem with her parents made me too angry to fully enjoy the book. There also wasn't a real clear cut plot other than Sam trying to come to terms with his new found life, and Grace hiding a terrible secret. Even though I prefer Sam and Grace's characters, both Cole and Isabel's inner conflicts added a new dimension to the story. However the rotating perspectives was a little harder to follow this time as the changes were much more frequent than the last book. While the ending of Shiver was abrupt, it still left me smiling. This one, however was even more abrupt, yet did not leave me with the same happiness at all. I'm really hoping the next book will be more like Shiver as I love these characters. Overall, it was just an okay read for me, but definitely worth reading if you enjoyed the first one.left her alone to raise herself.

0767830555|5.0|\\"Taxi Driver,\\" viewed in the wake of the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, unfolds like the keys you need to understand how something so horrible as an assassination happens. It is a profile in isolation, desperation, crisis of self-worth and the corrosive effects of an unhealthy society. You can see the trials of the misfit as he attempts to fit in with others and the deepening despair and feelings of insignificance that follow the failures. You can follow the logic trail to violence as expression of last resort. The arc of the storyline is so perfectly realized that the end feels almost tacked on, a throwaway comment on the attraction of manly, heroic violence that rings false, unless I'm misreading it. Either way, this is a storied and deservedly decorated piece of filmmaking, with brilliant turns by Robert DiNiro and Jodie Foster, and a great American director at or near the height of his powers.

For so long I've thought that my collection of verbal and behavioral tics were just part of who I am, but now after reading about every single one of them dissected in this book, I've discovered that I'm not weird, I'm just English!     Great read - I will be passing it around my American friends so that they are prepared in case they are ever in England and have to enter the pub conversation or discuss the weather...
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I'm new to the series, luckily DVR'ing the first 4 episodes of Gods of the Arena, and I have to say I absolutely love it. It has captured my attention--Tullius and Vettius make great protagonists to Batiatus--and I'm impressed at the realism for the time period--examples being when Quintas Batiatus (Hannah) and Solonius use the outdoor toilets and a community wipe (hand held device) as toilet paper, or in a scene where Batiatus is brushing his teeth with a wooden toothbrush bearing bristles. The verbiage and script is rich in color and a delight to behold. A word of caution, many scenes are graphic and r-rated (or worse), so definitely view with discretion if you have children in the house. I'm going to order the Blood and Sand series to get caught up on the story.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I am over 20 and I love Monsters Inc. My husband and I watch it without our daughter because we enjoy it so much. That's saying a lot; watching Disney without a kid.
0312600844|4.0|Now that I have read it, it absolutely lived up to my expectations.  I know that a lot of my appreciation has to do with the writing style; the particularly detailed, almost omniscient narrator is my favorite.  I found Franzen's voice refreshing and his vision of the US life, though somewhat bleak, was so realistic that the characters could have been my neighbors.<br /><br />Freedom is a family history of the fictional  Berglunds, from Patty and Walter's childhoods to their lukewarm courtship and their mutual betrayals over time.  Patty, a college athlete turned housewife, throws herself into renovating their house, but once the project is finished finds herself depressed.  Walter, a strong believer in population control and environmental protection, rides his bike to work every day but eventually changes jobs to a career that will alter his life forever.<br /><br />Did I like Walter and Patty, or their mutual musician friend Richard?  Absolutely not.  Did I agree with the decisions their children made?  Not once.  Did I enjoy reading about their lives?  I couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />Though I do not think this is the perfect novel, or the perfect US novel, I do think that this story perfectly captures a moment in our history with characters who, yes, are somewhat like caricatures of their real-life counterparts.  But never does Freedom venture into the unbelievable, rather only the extreme.  There is a little bit of all of us, our worst sides, in these characters.

0307386171|4.0|On Chesil Beach is such an intimate look at one couple, married during the early 60s.  I was continually impressed by McEwan's insights and how perfectly developed these two characters were.  Florence and Edward are thrilled to begin their married life together, to be no longer seen as young and incomplete members of society.  Florence, however, has a paralyzing anxiety about physical contact with her husband, something she has kept from him, dreading the moment that would consummate their marriage.<br /><br />I loved the combined narratives in this novel.  We are given glimpses into not only the wedding night, but also their courtship and their futures.  The narration shifts focus from Florence to Edward so we are given both sides to the story.  I really thought that this book was heartbreaking and honest, beautiful and quiet.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, it is that the last chapter of the novel that explores life after that wedding night is almost exclusively about Edward.  When the rest of the book had been so balanced, I was disappointed with the lack of information about Florence we received.  Overall, I'm impressed with McEwan's attention to detail, especially the sensitivity he employed when portraying Florence.  I'm so glad I finally picked this one up.  It might be one of my favorite reads of 2010 and one that I see myself rereading again soon.
B004529NLG|3.0|Okay, the story and characters didn't particularly draw me in (hence the three star rating), but the music, dancing and excellent 3D photography made up for those flaws.

0394800192|4.0|Although this is not the full version of the Ten Apples we have read through the library, my grandchildren bring this to me to read over and over again. It absorbs their interest immediately with each child counting apples as they increase on the heads of the silly animals! It's esay to pick up and easy to read. They know the words and never tire of becoming a part of it again!
0385737955|2.0|These two quotes perfectly sum up why I did not like this book:<br /><br />Why do I remember these animals? Thomas wondered. NOthing about them seemed new or interesting - he knew what they were called, what they normally ate, but not where he'd seen animals before, or with whom?  His memory loss was baffling in its complexity. (44)<br /><br />He returned his gaze to the Deadheads, a glowing disk still floating in his vision.  Blinking to clear it away, he suddenly caught the red lights again, flickering and skittering about deep in the darkness of the woods.  What are those things? he wondered, irritated that Alby hadn't answered him earlier.  The secrecy was very annoying.  (45)<br /><br />So redundant! Telling not showing! While the plot is exciting, it is often confusing and inconsistent. I haven't found the time to pick up The Scorch Trials. There are too many better books in the world.
1582701709|4.0|I'm still reading The Secret and understand all the positive thinking, I think its just going to be harder then it sounds.  I'm very intrigued though and really hope this works out for me.  Everything they say in the book makes perfect sense and I think everyone should read it and give it a try.
B004289ZW0|4.0|As many other reviewers had said before, the touch slide on/off feature is problematic. A traditional mechanical on/off switch would've worked much better and earned a five star rating.     Other than that, matching the GPS to the iPad via Bluetooth was really easy. It works perfectly with the ForeFlight HD app for iPad. The mini USB charger is a plus.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Mostly, it was fun to pick out local areas in this movie.  After getting more into the movie, I realized that it had to have been quite sensational for the time, given the subject matter. The only issue I really had with the movie is the lack of the local 'Yooper' accent for the characters.  Where it is supposed to take place, the locals have quite a noticeable accent.  Right, eh?
B001KOFH2G|5.0|As stated in title, this movie is what the prequels wish they could have been...a great fun movie.  The only sad part is I've come to the realization I'd have rather had more seasons of Firefly than the movie, but the movie is better than nothing. The blue-ray is an upgrade for me, since I already had the DVD...and wow, the visuals are amazing on this one, highly recommended for anyone who loves the movie.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This movie is the best movie made from a book I have ever seen.  It was originaly a several part series on BBC so it was longer than most movies.  However, what makes it great is that it follows the book very closely.
0385342039|4.0|Upon first reading this book I thought \\"What was Sophie Kinsella thinking?!?!\\".  But then I let myself get sucked into the book and stopped focusing on the fact that one of the book's main characters is a ghost.  The book is so funny and in the end you are rooting for Lara and Sadie.  Another job well done from Sophie Kinsella!

0740748475|5.0|I've been reading thru the Complete Calvin and Hobbes over breakfast each morning because - let's face it - I'm not ready to give up that aspect of my childhood. ;) Nothing like reading the comics over a bowl of cereal, though I can't say I'd volunteer to try more than a bowl - or maybe half a bowl - of chocolate frosted sugar bombs.<br /><br />I lvoe love love having the entire compilation - it's got every single strip without me having to go pull out any of the (many) comic books I own trying to remember where one C&H story line is ... or missing something, or duplicating strips because they're potentially covered in multiple publications, whether \\"Yukon Ho!\\" or \\"The Essential C&H\\".<br /><br />It's also been fun to read thru the strips chronologically. There are ones I missed over the years that help fill in a story line - because, yes, I read C&H enough that I could keep track of mini story lines ... *cough*notobsessed*cough*.<br /><br />Anyway - long story short - great read for any C&H fan. Brings back lots of memories from my own childhood.<br /><br />The compilation is well put together and I love the full-page art inserts. Even more fun after having read \\"Looking for Calvin and Hobbes\\", by Nevin Martell.

0375846735|3.0|The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials: Book 3), by Philip Pullman<br /><br /> I have finally finished this trilogy, and I feel safe saying that it is an exceptional story told by an unexceptional author. The story contains so much epic-ness, but Mr. Pullman merely muddles through: If Dust created consciousness, then why do conscious beings create dust? If the subtle knife can cut through into any world, than can it visit the void from whence the Specters come? Or is that not a world? If the subtle knife causes the Specters to enter whatever world, then why are they so afraid of it? If angels are so weak, then why did anyone ever fear them at all? If all of this was fated to happen (as most certainly seemed to be the case), then why was everyone so worried it wouldn't come about? So very many unanswered questions.<br /><br /> Also, I find it kind of ironic that a while back many people were decrying this series because in it they \\"kill God\\"; it's actually completely accidental and they are trying to save him; frankly it's extremely anti-climactic since that is the stated goal in the second book. It's almost as if Mr. Pullman didn't really know where he was going with his story, and just sort of wrote until he decided he was finished.<br /><br /> This one starts with Lyra as a captive of her Mother. Will wakes up to discover that she has been taken, and that there are two angels urging him to go to Asriel at once. He tells them that he won't go without Lyra, and so the angels set off to find her and help him locate her. Once they finally find her, one angel guards Will on his journey while another sets off to tell Asriel what's going on in the enemy camp.<br /><br /> Meanwhile Serafina goes to Iorek to tell him of Lee's death. Iorek sets out at once to view Lee's final resting place and find Lyra. He meets Will along the way, and together they save Lyra. Unfortunately, Will breaks the subtle knife in the process. Thankfully, Iorek fixes it.<br /><br /> Lyra decides that they need to go to the land of the dead in order to apologize for getting Roger killed, and to end death. So they use the newly fixed knife to get there (this part is really pretty cool; my summary isn't going to do it justice). There they meet harpies, who promise to guide them to a part where they can use the knife to escape. Will leaves the door open so that as people die they can make their way out (though they don't return to life but instead break up into Dust).<br /><br /> Lyra's Mother changes sides 40 million times. Also a race of small people with poisonous barbs are introduced as spies for Asriel. And then Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter sacrifice themselves to kill Metatron (not really a spoiler as the outcome was pretty obvious well before it happened...fate, after all). Then the angels seal up all the doors that were left open by previous wielders of the knife. That pretty much sums it all up.<br /><br /> It'd be interesting to see what a different author could do with this story; stupid copywrite laws interfering with my happiness again!<br /><br />Memorable Quote:<br /><br /> \\"Are we dead now?\\" Will said to teh boatman.<br /><br /> \\"Makes no difference,\\" he said. \\"There's some that came here never believing they were dead. They insisted all the way that they were alive, it was a mistake, someone would have to pay; made no difference.

B000XR4OC0|4.0|I ordered the olive green canvas Toms from \\"California Deals\\" via this page, and they were not the former olive green style pictured but the updated olive green Toms.  This means they do NOT have a brown & green camouflage lining and beige sole as shown, the actual shoes have animals on the lining (olive green & white) and ivory soles.  The animal lining and ivory soles are the same shoes currently available on the official TOMS website.  They are also identical to the lining style and sole color of the ASH shoes on this page.  I was a bit disappointed because I specifically ordered these via Amazon hoping they would be identical to those pictured and I prefer the look of darker, beige-brown soles instead of ivory.  While this detail is not a make or break deal for me, it may be for others so I wanted to put out a warning.<br /><br />These are my 3rd pair of Toms and I like them a lot, they are comfy and will complement my warm weather wardrobe.  However, I must say that in the future I will probably stick with premium Toms; my gold glitters and blue suedes, though slightly more expensive, just seem like such a better value for the money to me than canvas.  I notice some slight manufacturing flaws in the canvas shoe, for example one fits just slightly different than the other and I know it's not my foot because my other 2 pairs fit beautifully with no such flaws.  Still, the canvas are cute and comfortable shoes.  I found the canvas and suede run slightly larger than the glitter Toms do, although it's partly a matter of personal fit preference.

B004L3AQFG|4.0|Now that I've had a few weeks to process director Danny Boyle's latest film, 127 Hours (2010), I can discuss it without the incredible emotional turmoil that I felt when leaving the theater after seeing this film. I can't really think of too many other films that have \\"played\\" with me emotionally like this one does, except maybe the first time I saw Dead Poets Society (1989) in the theater as a teenager. I felt completely exhausted and broken emotionally for a few hours after 127 Hours, not sure if I liked the movie or not! Definitely not an easy film to watch in my mind. And yet now, with at least as many hours as the title of the film under my belt, I feel I can safely say that this is one of the best movies of 2010. Having only seen it once in the theater, I'm going to give it an initial rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. My instincts are telling me that I may feel like its an even better film upon a second viewing, which I definitely intend to give it when it comes out on Blu-ray in a month. This is a movie that has a lot of emotional depth and filmmaking craft to it that needs time to swallow, and I wouldn't be surprised if it moves up in my ratings over the years. But we'll see...for now I'll stick with my initial analysis.<br /><br />James Franco stars as Aron Ralston, the guy who this true story is inspired by. You might remember Ralston's story in the news back in 2003. Who wasn't shocked by the story of guy cutting off his own arm to save his life?! Definitely movie-making material in the right hands. There's no question in my mind that this is Franco's best work ever. Honestly, it had to be in order to make this movie even tolerable. I mean Franco is really all we have in the movie to keep our interest, and he does so very well. Franco's emotional roller-coaster ride of dealing with his arm being stuck under a rock is a feast to partake in. I was constantly wiping the tears away from my eyes as I went with him on this incredible journey, wondering if he was going to be able to do what he had to do...even though I knew he would. I will admit that this was a very hard movie to get through. While Franco is constantly looking at his watch in the movie, counting down the hours and days he's been stuck with his hand under a rock, I did the same in the theater. I found myself continually looking at my phone to see what time it was. I couldn't wait to get through this experience since it was so unbearable to watch and listen to as it builds to the expected climax. After the film, I thought more and more about how Danny Boyle probably intended that response from me, because the film definitely made me feel like I was stuck right there with Ralston, trying to get out. I mean we knew the outcome going in, so how do you engage your viewers? You make them feel on a very visceral level the same thoughts and emotions that Ralston felt while trapped under a rock. And I gotta give it to Boyle because I'm not sure too many other directors could've pulled it off at all, let alone as well as Boyle does here.<br /><br />It's almost a given that the cinematography should be outstanding on a film set in the canyonlands of Utah...what with the famous desert southwest sky and golden lighting. Directors of Photography Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle absolutely aced their presentation of this wild and rugged landscape, presenting it in both classic compositions that the great landscape photographers of the 20th century have perfected (like Ansel Adams, David Muench, and Jack Dykinga), as well as with a fresh, hyperkinetic look and feel that gave the millions-of-years-old vistas a certain energy. I liked the contrast between the home video camcorder footage and the epic filmic look of the movie. Same with the contrast between the macro detail photography and the wide angle vast landscapes. The entire film was shot in digital, but it looks as good as film. I've experienced and photographed a lot of this landscape over my 20 years of living inArizona and traveling throughout the southwest. And the photography in 127 Hours is about as good as it gets. No wonder I have so many still images from the trailers below!<br /><br />Apparently the filmmakers created the canyon where Ralston is stuck for all these hours on a soundstage, since obviously it would have been hard to film on location. From my eye, I couldn't tell the difference between the set and the real landscapes. Production Designer Suttirat Anne Larlab and her entire art department team did a spectacular job making us feel like we were in a slot canyon in Utah. The scenes where the camera pulls out from what I assume is the set to the real landscape are seamless. I was even looking for evidence of the canyon not being real since I knew it wasn't, but couldn't find it! Everything designed in this film served the story perfectly and gave it a very real feel.<br /><br />Music composer A.R. Rahman did a good job with the score and music selections for 127 Hours. I'm not quite as enamored with his work here as some, but I do think the music did a good job of helping tell the story and it's got a unique sound to it. There are actually quite a few very silent moments in the film with little or no music, and I think that actually worked well in the context of this story because it felt more real and helped emphasize the detailed sound effects of what Ralston is going through. As excruciating as they were to listen to at times. But again, it all served the story, and I have a feeling that on subsequent viewings when I know where the story is going and can prepare myself more emotionally, I may pay more attention to the integration of music in this movie. I've also got the soundtrack now and can listen to it on its own.<br /><br />The film editing on 127 Hours, led by Jon Harris, is fantastic. This is a story where it could really get boring or fall apart quickly. Luckily, Harris always pulled me back into the story when I felt it was getting long-in-the-tooth, which is surprising for a 94-minute flick. But 127 Hours at times felt like the length of the movie, and not just the title. But Harris' energetic editing kept me looking at the situation in new interesting ways. I'm not all that impressed with the triptych presentation of three various shots playing side by side. I liked it at first towards the beginning of the film, but by the end, it felt overused. Still, I'll give Harris and Boyle credit for thinking outside the box with the editing and visual presentation of the film. They knew they needed to keep things interesting and they did their best to do that.<br /><br />What Danny Boyle has done with 127 Hours is craft a very good story about how precious life is and how much we take it for granted each and every day. Ralston had no idea that when he went out for a day of biking and canyoneering in Southern Utah that he wouldn't be coming home with both arms intact. With his very being and psyche changed forever. What Ralston got from this painful life-changing experience is what we all crave to get at some point in our lives: meaning and purpose. Why are we here? What is our life for? What is important to us? Like so many of us, Ralston had to learn the hard way through trial and tribulation. Is there really any other way that we learn these lessons? We may not all lose a part of our physical body, but don't we all go through some sort of similar emotional experience at some point and see what's really real? Don't we discover at some point that this rat race modern lifestyle where we all run ragged keeping up with emails, texts, phone calls, and the buzz of the city, is not what's important? That there's something else out there for us to discover? Director Danny Boyle explores some very spiritual, emotional, philosophical, and psychological ideas in 127 Hours and he does it in a context where we, like Ralston, are trapped and forced to deal with those things. I can see why this film hasn't done as well at the box office as it should have. I was not exactly anxious to go see it either! It's a tough film to market and to get people to see. But if you make it through watching this movie, I promise there's something good on the other side. I don't know what it will be for you or when you'll get it. For me, it's hope. It's a reminder that I've been in situations, not that dissimilar from Ralston, off on my own hiking in the wilderness, with no real appreciation of the potential danger that comes with that. 127 Hours probably hit me so emotionally hard because I could relate to the story so strongly. And yet amongst and within all the risks of life are great rewards. Ralston risked his life, but got some incredible rewards in the end out of the tragic circumstances he precariously put himself in. I definitely now want to read his biography about the experience: Between A Rock and A Hard Place. So I can get a fuller picture of his personal experience.<br /><br />If you can still find 127 Hours in the theater near you, go see it. Otherwise wait for the Blu-ray in a few weeks. Either way, this is a movie to be seen at least once just to get the experience, positive or negative. For me it was both.e flick. But 127 Hours at times felt like the length of the movie, and not just the title. But Harris' energetic editing kept me looking at the situation in new interesting ways.

1439107955|5.0|I lost my mother in law recently from cancer and I wanted to find out more about this dreaded disease.   I didn't know what to expect since this is such a grim topic.  To my surprise, I came away feeling quite hopeful and positive about our long haul fight against cancer.      As a biographer, Dr Mukherjee knows his subject well. The breadth and depth of his coverage is astounding.  He leads us into the medical, historical, political and the cultural aspects of the cancer universe.  This universe has an array of  scientists, politicians, activists and patients all with the goal of beating cancer. It is their journey that makes this book so moving and interesting.    My mother in law was in palliative care and I didn't know what palliative care was all about.   I now have to thank Cecily Saunders for that. Like Germaine at the end of the book, my mother in law fought her own battle in her dignified way towards her end.  The patients' ordeal and suffering are so poignantly described in the book that I could relate to to those scenes and in this sense the book became very personal to me.    It is not just a medical book but a book of literature on many levels.    P.S.  I read this book on the Kindle originally.  Since then, I bought a hard cover because it's one of those books that's worth keeping.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|I LOVE Jeeves and Wooster, my husband even began reading it to my daughter while still in my womb. I was so excited to see these and purchased them for Valentine's Day. We are both disappointed by two facts; one, there are no subtitles nor can it be closed caption and secondly it doesn't have the \\"play all\\" feature. I wish every collection used that feature without fail. But what of us who need the subtitles? I was hoping there would be a BBC America version but I haven't found it yet if it's been made available. On the same day I purchased Black Adder from the BBC and it has all that I mentioned missing above and cute history shorts so you can understand the history about every season that the show is set in. Quite perfect. A&E needs to look towards BBC for examples of how to present a DVD geared for all customers! Amazon needs to list in description if a DVD is subtitled, too important not to! Jeeves & Wooster ARE PERFECT with a 5/5 as always, it's A&E that get's the negative marks!

0060005696|4.0|The main lesson I've learned from the book is that having lots of choices can make us feel like there is a perfect option available, but that we would be more satisfied if we set standards and then settled for what meets our standards instead of looking for the best that exists. This applies to buying thing, deciding what to spend an evening doing, or choosing a mate.    This book is worth reading because it has a very important thesis; the thesis is important both for us to apply to our individual lives and to think about on a social level. There is also some discussion of decision making and various ways that people make decisions irrationally. This is interesting, although I didn't feel that it fit together with the focused topic of the book. Perhaps Schwartz added this further to show that people do not make decisions rationally. We are bad at predicting how we will feel in the future. In particular, we think that we will want more choice than we really do. Schwartz gives an example of students who can either each week decide what they will have at that week's seminar, or can decide ahead of time what the snacks will be for all the future seminars. The students who chose ahead of time picked a variety of snacks thinking they would get bored of the same snack each week, while the students who chose the snacks one week at a time chose the same thing again and again. Another interesting kind of irrationality is that having to explain in words our choices affects the choices we make. We value what we can express even if that is a worse decision that what we can't easily put into words (pp. 137-139). Kahneman and Tversky come up many times in this book and it would be educative to look into their work.    I feel that Schwartz should have confronted more directly advocates of the belief \\"more choices=more freedom=better\\". Perhaps this could have involved responding to some representative passages from authors like Milton Friedman.    It's not clear that there is a best option to take for most problems. For example the problem of finding a mate; there are many qualities that we care about, so why ought there be a perfect mate in the world? And even if there are 10 000 matches that are equally close to perfect, how will you know that you have one of those and not one of the 100 000 second tier matches? This will take the pleasure out of the match you do have. Perhaps settling for good enough will make one even happier than being with a first tier match but wondering if one could do better.    Time spent deciding might not be useful if the options are very close to each other in their quality. Buridan's ass is the paradox of a donkey that is equally far from a bucket of water and a bale of hay, both of which it wants equally. There is no reason to choose either one, but if the donkey wants the best option it might spend forever analyzing until it finds a reason to choose one. Instead it could just go have some hay then go drink in less time than it would have taken to choose the so called best option.    Satisficing: accept outcomes that are good enough, or satisfy certain criteria for adequacy, rather than identifying an optimal solution. This is a good approach because deciding what an optimal solution is takes resources, so what would be an optimal solution if you didn't include decision costs may not in fact be the optimal solution.    Making a gigantic number of small decisions and worrying whether we made the best decision contributes to \\"learned helplessness\\" and depression (pp. 102, 204). When we are evaluating more than two options we experience multiple opportunity costs instead of just feeling like we're deprived of the next best option (p. 122). Wanting to make the best choices contributes to depression (p. 195), and one's attributional style affects whether one becomes depressed (p. 206).

B00006LPER|1.0|Shortly before seeing this film, I watched a DVD of Bertolucci's \\" The Dreamers\\", both for the first time. It was informative to compare the two products of film-makers who are regarded as serious practitioners of the Art, and whose work often incorporates explicitly sexual material that risks demeaning their serious intent and exposes them to the charge of gratuitous audience titillation. In the case of Bertolucci's movie, the sex was graphic and not in the best of taste, but one could argue that it had a place in the lives of its young protagonists who were representative of much of their generation: narcissistically focused upon their own self-gratification and freedom of expression at a time when freedom of expression as a whole was under restraint by the State. Not until their indulgence brought their cocooned existence crashing down did they see fit to join those at the barricades fighting for universal freedom.<br /><br />With \\"The Piano Teacher\\", it is an altogether different matter. We are exposed to two hours of sordid behaviour, self-destructive as well as destructive of others, by a totally deranged individual (Erika) with no redeeming feature beyond a certain musical talent, and no causal factor other than a domineering mother and a father who is mentioned only briefly, but who apparently went mad and killed himself. Even if we accept these as partially exonerating, it still leaves the whole experience as no more than a case-history of lunacy with no universal relevance and no political, moral, religious, ethical or philosophical purpose. The interview with Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika, included with this DVD reveals the lack of anything meaningful that all concerned in its production have to communicate to its audience. She describes the objective of the director and the motivation of the central character that she plays as an attempt to explore the search for \\" true love without the taint of seduction\\". What garbage! On this premise, genital mutilation, maternal incest, fornication on the floor of a public toilet, and submission to requested flagellation and physical brutality, all become justified as acts of \\"true love\\". It is clear that Huppert has no valid idea of why she is doing the awful things she is required by the director to perform; viewed in this light, her much-lauded performance becomes no more than a meaningless charade<br />involving a limited repertoire of scowling gestures and hysterical outbreaks<br />that soon become boring and irritating to watch.<br /><br />It does not help that the other characters are equally unattractive, at least in their behaviour. As the object of  Erika's perversions, Benoit Magimel initially presents as a sensitive and charismatic young man, but his descent into frenetic violence instead of simply walking away from an impossibly unsavoury relationship ruptures that bond of empathy with the viewer. The technical skills of Michael Haneke  are evident in the composition of many of the frames and sequences that give this film an artistic texture, coupled with the gorgeous music of Schubert, Bach and others that introduce brief interludes of sanitizing poetry. His serious talent, demonstrated in \\"Cache\\" and \\"The White Ribbon\\" persuaded me to discount the 16 1-star reviewers and heed the recommendations of the 54 who awarded the movie 5 stars, especially as many of the latter came from intelligent and critically eloquent film buffs. I was fully conditioned by his above-mentioned movies to become immersed in the lives of thoroughly unlikeable individuals, since these seem to represent the only segment of humanity in which he is interested. I expected the compensation of a challenging and thought-provoking experience in return. All I got was senseless depravity without meaning or justification.

0670022411|5.0|I'm currently reading this book....and it's pretty terrible, but no matter how bad it is I am going to give it a full 5 stars to make up in some small way for all the useless morons that have given this poor author 1 star based on the price of the book - idiots that did not have the decency to read the book before they reviewed it so poorly - ding dongs that complained about a price even though they didn't pay a dime for it.   Deborah Harkness has absolutely nothing to do with the pricing of her book and it is incredibly obnoxious to punish her for it.  Amazon readers come here to read reviews of the book by people that have actually read it....not to hear the useless complain about the price of something they didn't even buy!   When I came to see if this was something I might be interested in and saw all the bad reviews I almost didn't get it...then I saw what was going on here...and was pretty disgusted by the behavior of the 1 star posters....  I don't like vampire romance stories...I'm more of a vampire horror person - so if Twilight is your thing - you may really enjoy this....just don't go by the 1 star reviews - look at them before juding if you are interested in this book.  Audible has a good system in place where you cannot rate an item unless you have read/purchased it - Amazon really needs to implement something like that so the innocent authors don't get abused by the ignorant and inconsiderate.  Good luck to you Ms. Harkness - I hope this helps in some small way - I'm sure many readers will love your novel.
0142000671|4.0|I am not the fastest reader, but read this book in about 3 sittings the past two days.    While you might not understand every small detail (Early 20th century English), each paragraph tells you what is going on.  Steinbeck really paints a picture of every scene, yet not too many details to get boring.  The characters are very transferable to today, and makes the simplest characters complex.    If you are \\"scared\\" of classics, don't be of this one.  I enjoyed this novella greatly.
1416562605|2.0|The topics tackled in this book are worth the thought. Both the stars are for writing about the topics that are dear to my heart as an Indian.    But book is crap. This is what I call a Pseudo-Fiction. It exemplifies \\"Truthiness\\", overly simplifying the Indian society in terms of its social divides, family values, religious/social tolerances and corruption, without any sort of research or understanding of the Indian society.  Many reviewers have criticized the negative reviews because ultimately this is a fiction so nothing should be treated as a fact. The sad part is the fictional part should be the story line. e.g.    \\"It is an ancient and venerated custom of people in my country to start a story by praying to a Higher Power.  I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse...we Hindus have 36,000,000 gods... Making a grand total of 36,000,004 divine arses for me to choose from.\\"  and \\"Now, there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist.\\"     So where does the fiction end and facts begin (and vice versa.)    The parts about India and its culture are so distorted that somehow only western reviewers feel connected while the Indian readers don't.     I googled the author and was not at all surprised that the author is a completely western educated person who happens to be born in India.     To give due credit where it belongs, authors has superficially touched on key search terms such as IT, Bangalore, outsourcing, China, everything our western readers be concerned about India. and yes, amazing thoughts of the author that I have no doubts will be defended by other western or western minded reviewers as fiction:    \\"...all the Muslims you meet are illiterate or covered head to toe in black burkas or looking for buildings to blow up? It's a puzzle, isn't it?..\\"  (Fact: India is proud of its Muslims population that contributes tremendously in its film, cricket, science , governance and almost all the other important areas. )    The picture you get after reading this book is that people in India have no conscience, their family values are like a prison, there is no law, you can get away with anything and sometimes murder is justified as a tool for social emanancipation. All in all, you can write a novel like this based on your understanding of India from merely reading the \\"sensational news\\" in western media.    It is like forming your opinion of USA based only on reading Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.    Although I defend the author's right to write anything for his livelihood, I am not sure about the standards of the Man Booker prize committee after reading this book.    You can read this one inside of a day and those who want to still read it, I request you to borrow it from your library and donate the money you were to waste on this book to any organization that works for uplifting people from Darkness in India or anywhere for that matter!

Granted, I'm not a hater of \\"Indie\\" type of music (my favorite bands are SSP & Metric), but an advocate of pure talent and quality in music.

1594202842|5.0|Whatever one thinks of Amy Chua's tiger-mom parenting, \\"Battle Hymn\\" gets five stars for a great read.  I laughed; I cried (figuratively!); I read excerpts out loud to my family; I couldn't put it down.  Ms. Chua's book is entertaining, artfully written, and thought-provoking.  As an obsessive mom myself (who has chosen quite a different parenting road than Ms. Chua's), I can't recommend this book highly enough.
1594202842|3.0|I purchased this book just to see what all the hype was about.  I'd have to say that the book was an interesting read, fast paced and easy to read, but as far as enlightening me or stirring in me a need to have a long, drawn out firey heated discussion session, it did not do this for me.  There are parts of the book (ie. the part where Amy calls her younger daughter, Lulu, a barbarian and essentially stupid because she refused to eat the fish egg)where the author, in my opinion, seemed so closed minded and petty that it is difficult to fatham that she is a law professor.  As far as getting any tips on how to raise a highly successful offspring, dutiful and respectable individual, I wouldn't follow any of the methods Amy utilizes.  It is a fortunate coincidence that she has daughters instead of sons, because you never know now-a-days, with kids, if you push too hard, too controlling, you might become a tragedy of your parenting style.  I would never say the demeaning things she says to her daughter, and it is hard for me to imagine how her husband and daughters allow her to get away with all the things she does.  In my opinion, contrary to what Amy would like to be perceived as, she comes across in the book as a manipulative, controlling mother who really does all these things, claiming to be in the best interest of her daughters, where in reality, we all know, it is to get praises from all her collegues on how she is able to raise such accomplished, faboulous daughters, and we shouldn't forget, for the book sales.  I do have to give the author credit for her undaunting willpower and stubborness not to give up.      In summary, an entertaining book to read, but don't read it as if it is a memoir.  I'm sure the author fabricated some stuff up, so don't take it too seriouly.  I can't imagine if she did say and do the things she claimed to, that it wouldn't be on the edge of verbal abuse.  I cannot imagine anyone thriving in an abusive environment.

B004A8ZYZE|5.0|I am a presenter and give training sessions to many people throughout the year.  I am always looking to make my presentations more engaging and exciting.    Boy, as soon as I started reading this book I was Wow.  I finished it within two days and took some notes.  I wanted to educate our presenters at my Company about these presentation tips described by Garr.   I already did and people loved it.    Whoever is in training or in a presentation capacity should buy this book, read it and  take some notes and then apply it.  You will be amazed.    The book is not boring either, Garr did a wonderful job writing it.
0061433047|5.0|Discworld novels are generally light, fun reading.  Not that they aren't well written, but on a literary menu, they're a gourmet snack, not a meal.  This explains some of the criticism of this book.  While it has humor and mirth, it isn't light.  The humor is needed to balance the hard, painful parts of life that Sir Pratchett is portraying here.<br /><br />It isn't much of a spoiler to say that in the first part of the book, one of the major events is the beating of a pregnant teenager by her father, to the point where she miscarries.  Prejudice, angry mobs, religious bigotry are all covered here.  This is not light reading, and while I recommend the book even for adolescents, parents should read the book with their children (never a bad idea, but essential here) and be prepared for some uncomfortable conversations.<br /><br />Folks that have read the earlier Tiffany Aching books will find this to be a dramatic departure from the earlier books.  This Tiffany is more mature and less innocent.  She's been dealing with the ordinary problems of folks on the chalk for several years, and she's grown up a lot.  We even see another side of the Nac Mac Feegle as well.  We get a glimpse of what they would be if their home was seriously threatened.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, perhaps even more than the earlier books in the series, but I had read a few of the reviews here and was prepared for a serious novel.  I strongly recommend this book, but be ready for some serious reading.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|The journey that Sia takes you on with her album 'We Are Born' is fantastic! There are some real gems in here and it is definitely worth buying! A solid piece of work from this genius musician.
B000LC55F2|4.0|As I watched this movie, I noticed that the lighting always had two shades.  Night time, or dark scenes had a sliver of light coming through it; during daytime scenes, indoor scenes would have dark interiors and any exterior scenes were cloudy.  The reason I mention this is that the lighting also illustrates the duality of good and evil in this movie.      Christopher Nolan continues to impress, and does a great job alternating between the two main characters.  On the surface, I wasn't interested in the premise of this movie, but the rivalry between the two characters is tightly wound throughout the story.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great as the magicians, and Michael Caine once again delivers a finely understated role.    I understand how some people indicate that the magic has a deux ex machina feel to it.  However, I don't feel that it really detracts from the movie.  Well done, and certainly recommended.

B002ZG99TK|5.0|This is what blu-ray format was invented for, movies like this one! Brings back fond memories of when surround sound was first introduced to home theaters (talking laserdisc years here) and then AC-3 (Dolby Digital) was introduced on laserdisc and really brought the soundtrack 'to life'. This blu-ray reminds me why I love home theater. Not only is the hi-def video awesome, the soundtrack rocks the foundation! This is the way to experience this movie. Don't settle for the DVD, get this blu-ray instead...its well worth the upgrade. Not only the movie is exciting, this blu ray would make a bad movie good! That is how good this blu-ray is. Enjoy it and protect those subwoofers (and your walls)!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|This is a great headset.  My only complaint is that they start to hurt my ears (from the pressure) after a few hours of play.  When that happens, I take it as a sign that I've been playing too long :)    Would definitely recommend these to anyone!
0316044938|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. It literally gave me a headache trying to read through it. The author tried to cram about 6 thoughts into one broken up sentence. You have to reread the sentence a few times to even understand what she was trying to say, then you realize it has no significance. Guhh. It was almost like listening to a drunk person ramble on. Or talking to a child with severe ADD. It was so unorganized.   Don't waste your time.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I finally broke down and bought myself a set of gaming headphones because I was getting tired of having my chat headset on, and trying to still listen to the game. Get's crazy and causes headaches. Plus you miss a lot of key sounds that can help you.<br /><br />This is the best add on for my Xbox 360 I have purchased yet! Next to my T.V. of course. They are comfortable, even after hours of gaming/listening. They look nice, and the cord has plenty of cable to go around. The separate sound control features are really nice too. Being able to turn up the game or chat at any time is a very nice feature.<br /><br />I've only had them a day so far, but I love them. I played some Black Ops with friends and played some sweet games. With the expander turned on you can hear people coming from different directions, helps a lot.<br />Tried some Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, very sweet. The sound of the engine, the sirens, and when that chopper buzzes over you, you feel it.<br />The best experience so far was with Dead Space 2. I had already played through it once, but it seems scarier this time around with the headphones. The sounds are amazing in this game as is, and the headset makes it that much better.<br /><br />I also watched Resident Evil: Afterlife with them. At points I forget I had them on and caught myself grabbing for the remote thinking I was about to make my neighbors mad with my surround sound, till I realize I still have the headphones on. Can't wait to put the DSS on them for the 5.1 surround.<br /><br />My only complaint against these is the fact that when I have to charge my 360 controller while the chat cable is attached, it creates this really loud and annoying buzzing in the headset and in the chat/party.<br /><br />All in all this is one of the best gaming investments you can make. Just keep some pre-charged battery packs and/or batteries around if your chatting and gaming.
B004AKCMD4|4.0|Visually stunning film...especially if you're able to watch it on Blu Ray. You can tell they tried to cram a bigger story in a small time space, so there were parts of the story that suffered because of that but it was an enjoyable movie and and i can definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the books that its based off of or anyone who is just into great film making.
B002NPCSJG|5.0|Scalzi is a wonderful writer, the book is very engaging. Once you start reading, you will look up a few hours later and be finished. Then you will go out and get Ghost Brigades and enjoy that too.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|if you're a fan of DC Comics or the DC Universe movies. This movie was phenominal. I don't think i've ever seen an animated movie so raw and gritty that wasn't an over the top Anime movie. Great story and in spite of the characters being animated, great performances by the voice actors...especially the guy that played the Joker
B003AXS51A|5.0|I was crying on the second page of this book. Though I have cried reading many books, I have never cried quite so soon. But that's what The Art of Racing in the Rain does - it pulls at your heart and opens it up to feelings that are sometimes too painful to confront. The book is narrarated by a dog which, honestly to me, makes it all the more heartbreaking. The relationships and people in the book are believable regardless if they are only seen through the eyes of Enzo, the dog.<br /><br />This book has short chapters which I like because I could literally read one during a commercial break or, if I had to stop reading, I could do so quickly by just finishing the chapter. Life has become so hectic for many of us, and it makes it that much easier when the chapters are 5 pages and not 50, but I suppose that is a personal preference.<br /><br />You may feel hesitant because Enzo's owner is a car racer and you aren't into that, however, I promise, you do not have to be into car racing to enjoy this book. You only have to have a heart.<br /><br />You should read this book, your year will not be complete without it.
B0034G4OWM|1.0|Forget all of my other reviews.  This one simply takes the cake as the worst movie ever created.  Ed Wood is turning over in his grave, and Albert Brooks will soon after he dies.  This is the biggest pile of donkey dung ever put together.  Brendan Frasier better get a new agent or be permanently banished into B-C films for the rest of his life.  This makes Mummy III look like Oscar material.  There is a reason Brendan Fraser isn't to be seen in films lately...this film is why.  I would hope he has fired whatever agent booked him for this mess.

0312600844|1.0|I had read so many glowing reviews that I just had to read this book. And I read it all the way through, hoping that somewhere, somehow, I would begin to care about these wooden, cliched, unpleasant characters.     But it never happened, and now I've lost my  trust in literary reviewers. This was simply a terrible book...tedious, cliche, unbelievable. I write this only to urge anyone determined, as I was, to plod on through this dreadful book in order to discover what it was that so enthralled the critics, to abandon hope.     Drop it on page one and find something better to do.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I chose this book because it's so popular, and supposedly written for high school age. The characters are one-dimensional, the issues never fully developed or resolved, except that the 'wallflower' is allowed to come along to their parties, and eventually is accepted as a friend, though there are very few reasons for why he merits this. His vocabulary is singularly juvenile, far below his alleged age, and his sexual view of every relationship makes him seem limited mentally. I don't know any high school students who would find this kind of person interesting or worth being friends with. Innocence and stupidity being two things that teenagers do not want to claim or seem to be. And the anonymous letters lead you to believe it will be revealed as part of the story and it never is. Who the heck does he know well enough to write to on these most personal of topics? A very strange and tiring book.
0439023521|5.0|I'm what is generously considered an \\"older adult\\". Ok, ok, an old f&*!. I read mostly horror and some sci-fi, and saw that this trilogy was highly thought of on some horror fiction boards. It is excellent! Each volume is darker and more horrific than the previous one, and the finale leaves one at Edward Lee's doorstep--if you kiddies are old enough to read something that extreme.    There is not much sex; I think that's already been mentioned. But there is plenty of grusomeness and 'blood, guts & gore'.    The story is sort of like Running Man (the short story maybe more than the movie) and what seems to be pretty horrific at the start, The Hunger Games, becomes moreso in following volumes. The end is well done and fits the book--it was well constructed. The characters are believable, and the story is a bildungs-Roman, a story of growing up, by the main protagonist, Katniss.    The only downside: I finished this series in 3 days. I'm a slow reader. Readers who liked this, and want something a bit more adult should look into Richard Laymon and Ed Lee.
1449389627|5.0|This new book from O'Reilly Media appears to be yet another book that attempts to cover the topic of innovation but does a better job than most of defining the myths and truths of  innovation historically. The author proposes that eureka moments don't happen, and rather \\"there is a period of incubation in which the knowledge is digested, leading to experiments and rough attempts at solutions.\\" And \\"Nearly every major innovation of the 20th century took place without claims of epiphany.\\"    In discussing the history of innovation, he notes that examples like Gutenberg whose influence was not felt until after his death. The history of innovation was not straight line of successes but rather as many failures and setbacks and often governed by political and social circumstances. He notes when you really dissect the evolution of innovations that \\"invention and adoption is based on ordinary, selfish, and mostly short-term motivations.\\"    If there is a formula for innovation, it includes hard work and persistence, curiosity, the desire for wealth, and necessity. So proceeding in innovation requires: finding an idea, developing a solution, sponsorship and funding, scaling, reaching customers, beating competitors, timing, keeping the lights on. At the same time, he notes, there can be infinite paths to innovation as recent history has shown whether looking at Flickr, 3M or Craig's List. He also destroys the myth of the lone inventor.    The books also deals with barriers to innovation, the main one's being negative responses like \\"this will never work\\" and the fact that managers tend to stifle innovation. \\"Ideas need nurturing and are grown, not manufactured, which suggests that idea shortages are self-inflicted. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that ideas will always be easier to find if they're not shot down on sight.\\" Managers can be toxic to new ideas. \\"high experience and confidence make people the greatest resisters to new ideas as they have the most to lose.\\" Maybe this is why some innovators leave large organizations and start their own companies. The good news is that managers can nurture innovation by protecting and shepherding them. Framing ideas can help solve them - especially when thinking through how the innovation will solve a practical need.    The book concludes by trying to get beyond the hype of which there is more today than any time in history. Innovators of the past did not read books about innovation or attend TED conferences, although some may have been inspired by other innovators in history. Innovations requires the willingness to take risks, working with teams, get beyond the obsession with epiphany, and get beyond the work innovation.    In conclusion, he gives five suggestions:    Pick a project and start doing something  Forget innovation: focus on being good  If you work with others, you need leadership and trust  If you work with others and things are not going well, make the team smaller  Be happy about interesting \\"mistakes.\\"  The book also has suggestions for creative thinking hacks.    Overall, the book not only debunks many myths about innovation but also provides practical advice. For me the chapter on how managers can either inhibit or promote innovation. This is where innovation either grows or dies. For healthcare, the opportunities for innovation are everywhere in the care process if they are not blocked by managers or oppressive policies and oversight. The book does not address adequately the use of internet tools in promoting innovative ideas. These include Twitter, blogs,
0783225792|2.0|The first hour of &#34;Casino&#34; (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best — a mini-masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace. Unfortunately, once you get past the dazzling semi-documentary introduction, the remaining two hours become a tired self-parody of the director's earlier crime films. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone cannot redeem a disappointingly melodramatic script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. In the end, the ambitious yet overlong &#34;Casino&#34; fails to pay off.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING: **½

B003EYVXUU|5.0|The most memorable horror movies of all time are infused with real emotion - the gripping terror of a mother watching her child descend into monstrosity (The Exorcist); the growing fear of a beautiful young wife that she is surrounded by evil (Rosemary's Baby); the devasting loneliness, and ultimate revenge, of a sad high school wallflower (Carrie).  Let Me In is the first honestly terrific horror movie to come along since these classics.  The spooky beauty of this film - from its artfully shot locations, its lush musical score, to its mesmerizing performances - is only one of its many assets.  Most importantly, Let Me In tells an original story and draws you in to the world of two children, both of whom must deal with extraordinary pain and alienation.  The potent mix of spine-shivering terror and lump in your throat works magic in this, a most unlikely entry into the vampire catalog; you won't soon forget Abby once you've let her in.

B000068R1X|5.0|While this isn't the best of Ozzy's recordings, it is still a great album with some killer songs. This was his first recording after Randy Rhodes passed away. Jake E. Lee came in as the new guitar player and had some huge shoes to fill. And fill them he did! The title track is a classic, and Rock-Roll Rebel has a killer riff. So Tired is a cool sounding ballad and a nice switch from the rest of the songs. Jake's playing is amazing and I wish he would have recorded more stuff with Ozzy. I highly recommend this if you like Ozzy or 80's metal. You can't go wrong!

It's a nice recovery by Reynolds after the disappointing (for him) \\"The Prefect.\\"<br /><br />Purslane (the careful hoarder) and Campion (the impulsive adventurer) are clones and lovers. They tell the the story in alternating first-person narratives, punctuated by appearances from the original Abigail Gentian, who founded their line of clones--the line that somebody is now doing their best to destroy. Abigail is also obsessed with a virtual game called Pavilion, which has a medieval theme, and some of the events in the game leak into the main story, and vice versa.<br /><br />The story's engrossing, the science is imaginative, the end is enthralling.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I love Megamind.<br /><br />I shouldn't.  I'm not particularly fond of Will Ferrell, who often seems to be adlibbing to amuse only himself.  I'm over the whole \\"superheroes are celebrities\\" angle.  And at this point I think we all know most villains are just misunderstood.<br /><br />But Megamind nails it.  Ferrell, as Megamind, is a giant blue-headed geek that's easy to sympathize because he's not a muscle-bound villain.  He's the scheming nerd to rival Metro Man's (Brad Pitt, but it should have been Bruce Campbell) ridiculous physical stature.  Megamind, you see, is a victim of his upbringing, raised in a prison, unlike his rival Metro Man who was raised on a farm.  The two go to school together and Megamind learns quickly that being smart isn't the same as being popular.<br /><br />Tina Fey is pitch-perfect as Roxanne Ritchi, lending a cute lisp to a gal reporter that has played the damsel in distress a dozen times too many. She has the majority of the dialogue and shoulders it well.<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Minion (David Cross), a fish in a robotic gorilla suit. Cross, like Ferrell, can occasionally overdo it, but here his comedy is perfectly nuanced as a worrywart mother-figure that happens to be a fish in a gorilla suit. He and Ferrell are a great team, like an old married couple that just happens to share a supervillain lair.<br /><br />All these characters' fates collide when Megamind finally succeeds in killing Metro Man.  Momentarily elated, Megamind discovers that life isn't quite the same without his archnemesis. It leaves him feeling hollow, and Megamind soon comes to realize that the issue isn't Metro Man, but himself.  Two competing interests help fill the void in the form of his burgeoning romance with Ritchi (disguised as Bernard) and his mentoring of new superhero Tighten.<br /><br />There are two other characters that actually carry much of the plot: Bernard (Ben Stiller) and Tighten (Jonah Hill).  Bernard is the alter-ego of Megamind, who puts his hologram device to work by disguising himself as a hapless museum curator.  Tighten (originally Titan, but kids these days!)  is the inverse of Megamind - if Megamind is a nerd with outside ambitions, Tighten is a geek with no ambition whatsoever.<br /><br />What Megamind does so well is contrast the supervillain archetype.  Every nerd has faced off against a jock and felt inferior. Every geek secretly harbors a brilliant, raging Megamind-like ego and a needy, insecure Tighten. And for every clean-cut celebrity espousing healthy living and high morals, there's a heavy metal opposite who craves the same spotlight.  Megamind and Metro Man are also Gen X heroes, representing the uncertainty of thirty-somethings trying to figure out what they want to be now that they've grown up.  The contrast is heightened by Tighten, a Gen Y punk who would rather waste his superhero powers playing videogames (kids these days!).<br /><br />In the end, what Megamind does best can be summed up in the one word he uses to distinguish a true supervillain from a jerk: PRESENTATION!guising himself as a hapless museum curator.

B001ECQ75A|4.0|I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. I had hesitated because Jack Black played the title character. But the acting fit. It was not over blown. The artwork was stunning. The movie is well worth watching.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|UNSTOPPABLE is a genre film - minimal story/lots of action - and as such it succeeds very well.  Probably for audience breathing time the story line introduces some psychological exchanges between the two characters - in formation about their family lives that seem oddly out of place with all the terror on the screen - and that aspect of the film adds some human drama that makes the final product more credible: it is, actually based on a true story. The fact that veteran action flick creators - writer Mark Bombeck and director Tony Scott - are 'on board' this project assures the popularity quotient.<br /><br />Frank (Denzel Washington) is an aging soon to be retired train engineer and is joined by a young, emotionally distracted but well-trained new conductor Will (Chris Pine) who are out on what seems to be a routine run in Pennsylvania.  They banter caustically until hearing that there is a full speed runaway train (engineer Dewey - Ethan Suplee - left his position in the train with the throttle on) that happens to be carrying toxic chemicals. Should the train proceed with its runaway course many lives could be endangered when the train reaches a critical curve in the tracts in Stanton , PA.  Frank decides the only way to stop the train would be to go in reverse and lock onto the back of the train, putting on the brakes to slow the runaway train.  Frank and Will decide to brave the elements and attempt this near impossible task, much against the advice of the chief Galvin (Kevin Dunn) but with the daring go ahead signal form the men's immediate boss Connie (Rosario Dawson).  During this breakneck chase Will relates his fragile marriage to a wife (Jessy Schram) who refuses to return or accept his calls and Frank confides in Will that his wife died a few years ago form cancer, leaving his the sole parent for his two daughters (Elizabeth Mathis and Meagan Tandy): they both have family deadlines to meet that very day.  How the two not only become friends but allies in heroic effort to stop the incipient tragedy makes of the ending of the film.<br /><br />Washington and Pine make fine acting partners and the off the tracks work by Dawson and Dunn and the other small parts are well executed.  The special effects are excellent.  The fact that seemingly far-fetched story is true adds to the appreciation of the film.  This is a solid action flick with some standout performances.

030746363X|4.0|Before I bought this, I read some reviews complaining about all the positive reviews so shortly after the book came out, and how there was no way that it could work, blah, blah. I tried it anyway, and holy crap, it works! I lost almost 20 pounds (18.6), and I'm just in my 6th week of the diet, cheating a little and not doing any of the exercises. I love this thing, and I'm eating more steak than ever! My only complain is, there should be a light version for those who don't want to gain 100 pounds of muscle, or who don't care about the dozens of pages of the science stuff. Actually, a blog entry can take care of it, but it works so well that I'm more than glad to support Tim.
0439023521|5.0|STORY BRIEF FOR ALL 3 BOOKS:<br />This is a series of three books.  The story takes place in the North American continent in the future.  There have been wars.  The result is one winner (an area in the Rocky Mountains called the Capital) which rules over the other thirteen districts in oppressing dictator fashion.  Each district has one major industry in which everyone works.  District 11 is agricultural, producing food.  District 8 has factories manufacturing products.  District 12 mines coal.  The Capital keeps the people in the districts in poverty and near starvation.  The Hunger Games are held once a year.  Two teenagers from each district (one boy and one girl) are chosen in a lottery.  The contestants are thrown into a multi-mile arena and must kill each other, with one resulting victor.  Cameras throughout the area film the event for live TV.  The game creators throw in things such as forest fires and mutated creatures.  The Hunger Games are punishments to the districts for prior rebellions against the Capital.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION ON ALL 3 BOOKS:<br />On hindsight, I would have gotten the most enjoyment from the following.  Read books 1 and 2.  Then read my two paragraph summary of book 3's ending.  This summary is the first comment AFTER my REVIEW of book 3.  The last part of book 3 was too depressing.  I was in a miserable mood for a couple of days.  I don't like to feel that way.  I needed to know what happened to Katniss and others, but I wish I didn't have to read book 3 to find out.<br /><br />The series (must be read in order):<br />5 stars.  Book 1:  The Hunger Games<br />5 stars.  Book 2:  Catching Fire<br />2 stars.  Book 3:  Mockingjay<br /><br />STORY BRIEF FOR THE FIRST BOOK \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br />Her father died in a coal mine explosion when Katniss was 11.  In order to provide food for the family, Katniss learns to hunt with a bow and arrow.  She sneaks out of the District into the woods and shoots game.  She hunts with her best friend Gale, who is good at trapping.  When the lottery selects Katniss' younger sister Prim to go to the Hunger Games, Katniss immediately steps forward to take her place.  Peeta the baker's son is the boy chosen to go.  The story is about Katniss and Peeta traveling to the Capital and being contestants in the game.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />Book 1 is complete with a happy ending, but oppression and evil still exist.  So it's a partial happy ending in the way of the Harry Potter endings.  Each book has good defeating bad, but the destruction of the main evil force doesn't happen until the last book in the series.  You don't have to read books 2 and 3 of the Hunger Games, but if you like book 1, you'll want to read more.  It's told in first person which is not my favorite, but it works.  It increases suspense by staying in Katniss' mind.<br /><br />If someone tells me good people die in a book, my first reaction is I don't want to read it.  I don't want to be depressed.  But the emotions I felt during this book were more about excitement, fear, and fulfillment than depression and grief.  Again it's similar to the Harry Potter books in that deaths of good people creates more hatred toward evil rulers.  There is some grief, but it's not the major feeling.<br /><br />This is young adult (YA) science fiction.  I am much older than YA, and I loved it.  It reminded me of how I felt reading the Harry Potter and Twilight series.  There is something wonderful and great about it.  Don't expect the romance of Twilight.  It's more about various relationships which I love: family, friends, supporters, enemies, allies, love, evil, and \\"changes\\" in relationships.  There are heartwarming relationships.

B003U0AHBO|3.0|I had very high hopes for this movie.  The trailers were fantastic and I have always enjoyed the Robin Hood story be it in the Prince of Thieves, Disney, or Men in Tights versions.  Robin Hood is just an interesting character with a great persona and mission.      It seems that typically Robin has been portrayed as a pretty boy.  I think Russell Crowe did a great job blowing that aspect away.  I'm not trying to saying Crowe is as ugly as a mud fence, I'm just saying he appears to be more of a rough outdoors type.  He has more of a worn soldier look, which I think fits the character better, especially living in the woods and running from the law constantly (that just can't be good for your youthful look).    I also like that Scott took this film in the direction of a prequel.  It is so hard to come up with a back story to a character like Robin, especially someone that is suspected to have been a real person, but is not supported by any real concrete evidence.  Marion is referred to as Marion Loxley, and its very interesting to see her and Robin together as simple aquaintances rather than a romantic item.  It gives a little more depth to their relationship.  Cate Blanchett plays an awesome part as Marion by the way.  Another stand-out character was Mark Addy as Friar Tuck.  Tuck to me has always played an important part in Hood stories, just as much if not more so than Robin himself, and Addy just does such a good job with Tuck.  Such comic relief and memorable instances. Danny Houston, Oscar Isaac, Matthew Macfadyen, I'm just sorry but I don't think they spent very much time on your characters so I'm going to have to say, boring portrayals of King Richard, Prince John, and Nottingham Sheriff.  Kevin Durand was a great Little John and was actually well supported by Robin's other followers.  All together they made quite a funny group that I think really added to this movie.    Now for the parts I don't like (usually I do these first, but it just seems more fitting inthis situation to do them last)    1- King Richard was killed off way too fast.  I would have liked to see more of Richard, or a possibility of a return.  As in the Disney Robin Hood where Richard returned at the end to overthrow Prince John, I think Richard should have been kept available for a comeback.  Such a good character and it seems a shame to get rid of him.  Potential for a future antagonist or protagonist, but not now.  Granted, it did work into the story, so at least it wasn't completely senseless.    2- The movie is just so...lacking.  There is just that element that would put it over that is missing.  It exists.  You don't want to say it wasn't a good movie but you really can't think of anything good to say about it either.  It just plays with you too much, there is so much potential and so much to keep your attention that you can't turn away.  Its not boring, but its not entertaining.  The only thing I really know to compare it to is a day of unsuccessful deer hunting.  You got to do something, the potential for something great to happen was there, but in the end what did you really walk away with?    3- Robin was noted in the movie as being an exceptional archer.  Not an extremely gifted archer, but exceptional.  However, he hardly ever shoots a bow!  In the big battle scene at the beach (climax of the movie) hes running around swinging a freaking sledge hammer! What sense did that make?  If I was the Craig Harrison of bow shooting, why not post up on a ridge?  Ride horse back through firing arrows but come on, a hammer?  *SLIGHT SPOILER* The best part of the whole movie was at the end, where the Sheriff of Nottingham is posting WANTED posters for Robin, he asks \\"Where is a nail?\\" and an arrow comes flying out of the woods and pins the poster to a tree and everyone starts laughing.  Some guy stands up in the theater I was in and yells \\"Who the **** shot that?!\\"  I couldn't help but scream \\"Robin Hood dumb @$$!\\" and of course the whole theater startslaughing.  Come on, who shot the arrow?    All in all, its a good watch for a lazy Sunday.  Like I said, its not great but its not bad.  The good I see in this is, there are plenty of chances to expand.  The back story is out of the way and now we can make some real Robin Hood action go on.  Nice prequel but I just don't think this will stand alone as a movie.

Books 1 and 2 are about Katniss and Peeta being contestants in two Hunger Games.  Book 2 ends at the end of a Hunger Game, but it's not a happy ending because good guys are still in harm's way.  I needed to go right into Book 3 to continue the story.  Book 3 does not have the excitement and pulse of the previous two books.  It has more of an ordinary feel.  It's about the Rebels' plans and actions to unite the Districts and defeat the Capital.  Katniss and Gale join the Rebels.  The last part of book 3 was depressing.  Favorite characters die.  Others are hurting and grieving.  I was in a miserable mood for a couple of days.  I don't like to feel that way.  I needed to know what happened to various characters, but I regret having read book 3.  Somehow I was able to handle the deaths of good characters in books 1 and 2 but not in book 3.<br /><br />I've put a summary of book 3's ending in the comment after this review.  The purpose is for readers (like me) to enjoy books 1 and 2 and then read the summary instead of book 3.  Some readers don't mind depressing books.  So for you, I'd say yes, go for it, read book 3.  But for me, I needed a different ending - neatly tied up and happier.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Story length: 390 pages.  Swearing language: none.  Sexual content: none.

B002ZG999U|2.0|Was that an Arnold cameo or was he auditioning for Grumpy Old Men 3? I couldn't tell. I'm glad Seagal or Jean Claude didn't get in on this - they've both made enough bad movies (but I still like 'em) so no reason to add another one to the list of krap! Thanks guys.<br /><br />Stallone was actually pretty good in this I thought and he still looks salvageable - I guess the roids haven't quite ravaged him as much as they did the Governator.  Also glad to see Willis and O'Rourke had minor roles - they are both super annoying, so I just napped during their brief scenes. Stallone, Jet Li, the black dude (sorry I don't know his name) and Jason Statham (to a lesser extent) really carry the movie. 2.5 stars for some decent albeit freshman-level actions scenes, no stars for the wannabe Commando-like plot.<br /><br />Final Grade: C
B00005JKG7|3.0|John Carpentar created many memorable horror films in the late 70's and 80's. Ive noticed though his music in those films always seems to be the same but in a different key but I digress.    The Fog has a unique story, a great atmosphere, and just falls short of great. This film feels rushed as the film barely clocks in at an hour and half. The story barely takes off and its over. I still enjoyed it and it's better then more then 85% of horror movies released today.
B000055Y0X|5.0|As a child of the Cold War, this film serves as a reminder of those bad old days wondering when the big one would happen.  An all-star cast led by Peter Sellers, serve to defuse those musings with a parody that's beyond belief.

B000P0J0EW|4.0|This is an excellent, excellent movie.  I never tire of watching it.  There are, however some snags in the production and plot that bother me enough to take one star away:    - Could a person stay in one cell long enough to dig that big of a hole without having to disguise it in a better way than hanging a poster over it?  Don't they ever inspect? or paint?    - The actual escape seem implausible.  I can go along with it, but I would rather see him come up with a bit more original and clever method    - The closing scene.  If Andy made his way to Mexico with a good chunk of cash, I would expect to see him with a quiet but successful little business at a marina or elsewhere - not scraping old paint off of a derelict boat on a desolate beach.  Almost seems it would make Morgan Freeman want to go back to prison.  He would surely be taken aback!
0765322889|2.0|As a fantasy fiction reader who has devoured George R. R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and also deeply enjoyed the historical fiction of Ken Follet, I had high hopes for Gardens of the Moon and hoped to read the entire series back-to-back.  In actuality, I could barely read more than a few pages of this book in one sitting and am now going to abandon it unfinished.  Here are the reasons it didn't grab me:    There is a lot of effort spent on creative fantasy names for different locations and populations, with limited description of the necessary back story.  What is the history of the inhabitants?  How does the society run?  What are their strengths, weaknesses, and outlook?  What are their plans?  The number of different locations, races, demi-god players, immortals, and martial leaders are thrown together without sufficiently conveying to the reader who these characters are or what they want; hence, there is little opportunity for dramatic tension to be created in the story.    The magical spells and effects are poured very liberally into the story without, again, much explanation of why one character has access to some powers and not others, or what the risks or benefits are of characters traversing a \\"warren\\" -- a magical dimension that allows access to certain powers -- or even a mention of the underlying system and related choices.  What warrens exist and how are they different?  Why is it customary for a character to access one warren but risky to access another?  Why would a character choose to become an undead shell of her former self rather than return to a commander as requested?  The shortage of discussion about the motives, risks, and goals of the characters makes the magical choices and effects seem arbitrary and inconsistent.  The massive power differences between different races and demi-gods may certainly be woven into a story, but the author insufficiently describes how these massive powers are checked and balanced in the magical ecosystem of the author's world.    Finally, the dialog between characters is superficial and conversational, rather than advancing the back story and plot.  Even if an author can't achieve plot advancement through a 3rd party voice, character narratives, or flashbacks, hopefully the characters will at least talk about significant factors influencing the current situation.  Here, again, the author drops the ball.  Character interaction takes the form of status reporting and undeveloped personal concerns, rather than the flashbacks and narratives that can help a reader understand the character's point of view.    Overall, it seems that the author tried to create a fantasy fiction narrative by simply mixing in fantastical-sounding names, places, races, and magical effects.  But the story and character development just isn't sufficient to convince me that any of these things could actually co-exist in a cohesive fantasy world.  So, I am putting the book down and plan to get rid of the next two books in the series, unread.
B001TODCII|1.0|I actually enjoyed the first few minutes of the movie, and was looking forward to seeing how he was going to cleverly accomplish the mission.  However, it quickly collapsed into an impossible shoot-em-up, highlighted by incredible car chases, at night, thru unfamiliar streets and construction sites, with the hero never failing to make the perfect move. Oh, and the expenditure of countless rounds of ammunition, and a jump from a bridge to a boat, perfectly timed after speeding thru streets and causing untold collateral damage.  I wondered who took care of all those \\"accidents\\" and where were the authorities during this mayhem? And how did the daughter get her passport back?

044654759X|3.0|Nicholas Sparks' detailed and creative writing style remains a highlight of his novels. However, I found Safe Haven to be an inaccurate portrail of the domestic violence cycle abusers and victims engage in. In addition, Kevin's character encompasses most of the stereotypes one could think of when picturing what domestic violence looks like. Anyone can become a victim of domestic violence regardless of social and economic status, profession, and gender. I wish Kevin would have had a more complex and different background. This novel lacks some depth which, in my mind, would have improved it greatly.

B002ZG981E|2.0|I reviewed this movie on a pay per view channel of Dish Network. I figured with all the hype and the class actors in it, that it would be a good movie. Not so. I found it impossible to figure out what was happening or where the story was going. I just may be too stupid to intellectually enjoy this poorly presented film. I do not recommend anyone buying it unless you have an IQ in the genius range or so much inquisitiveness that you find it compelling. That, I do not have; I am only average at 125. Thus, for me, turning the movie off after watching only a bit over half of it was a relief for both my mind and my senses.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is my first introduction to Suzanne Collins' writing and I must say I've never read anything quite like it. There is an immediacy to her writing that pulls you in, so that you can easily relate to the characters in their struggle for survival. The story itself takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a surviving nation consists of a capital that oppresses its outlying districts due to a former rebellion. Not only are the districts denied the privileges of the capital, they are subjected to a cruel form of punishment in which each district is required to hand over two of their children-one boy, one girl-each year, to participate in a nationally televised fight-to-the-death/survival-of-the-fittest contest called the Hunger Games.     The book centers on a heroine named Katniss, and how she manages not only to survive the games, but outwit its gamemasters. The action is fast-paced, a real page-turner, and there is plenty of suspense as well.  Not predictable at all.     As an aside, one of the other things I liked about the book was how it caused me to consider what it might be like to live in this fictional (thank goodness!) society. It's definitely one of those stories that stays with you...

But, I was honestly angry at how awful this was. By the end I was laughing out loud and screaming in my head. I wish I was enough of a jerk to give away the \\"ending\\" to stop people from reading this.

I scoffed at the whole board game thing since, while entertaining, I'd never been that interested and focused much more on video games. I've since become completely obsessed with this game. It's elegant in it's simplicity yet completely engaging. Each time you play the experience is slightly different and I love how social it is. I cannot recommend this game highly enough to any board game fans or newbies at the genre (as I was). Give settlers a try and i know you'll love it.

0307408833|1.0|OK.  First off the author gives you different recipes than the ones that are used in the bakery.  I knew someone who worked there - they are different!  Especially the frosting - so if that is why you want to buy this book - do not bother.    Babycakes - the store - and website - sell this book for 24 bucks - so at least through Amazon you are not being ripped off that badly.    And lastly - although the recipes may sound nice - and the pictures look amazing - do not be fooled.  The recipes are horrible and never turn out the way they are supposed to.  The book serves more like a picture book - just pretty pictures.  The food and desserts I make myself may not look as pretty but taste waaaay better.    Lastly - unless you have actually eaten at Babycakes, on numerous occasions (because most of the time it is a hit or miss anyway), don't bother to buy this book.  You will be highly disappointed - especially if you have baked vegan before.

B0007XT7V8|5.0|The music of Theory of a Deadman may cater to a specific taste. Honestly, I have to say that I do like it. It's obvious that the band is not in the same league as, say, Deep Purple or Sevendust. But that's not say that the music isn't as addictive. Despite some unoriginal melodies, I always find myself greatly enjoying the post-grunge sounds. Gasoline, their second album, is just as good as their first one. Songs such as \\"No Way Out,\\" \\"No Surprise,\\" and \\"Save the Best for Last\\" make for a satisfying listening experience. There are two songs (\\"Quiver\\" and \\"Hating Hollywood\\") that are pretty weak, but the rest (\\"Santa Monica,\\" \\"Say Goodbye,\\" \\"Since You've Been Gone\\") are pretty solid. Both \\"Hating Hollywood\\" and \\"Santa Monica\\" seem to be negative reactions to the city of Los Angeles, but even if it is, it still doesn't injure my love for Southern California. I can't find a personal favorite on this album, but I'm sure that I will later on.<br /><br />Theory of a Deadman may not be marketable enough for the general public, but it doesn't really matter. I like their music, and I like this album very much.<br /><br />Grade: 8.8/10

B0002EXH4A|4.0|Normally, I would rate a Megadeth album very high because I admire their music so very much. With So Far, So Good...So What, which was released back in 1988, I find that this one falls a bit short. The music is still impressive, filled with timeless thrash all around. And the lyrics are appropriate for this type of music. But what gives me a bit of disappointment is the fact that some of the songs don't sound very catchy or compelling. \\"Hook in Mouth,\\" \\"502,\\" and the Sex Pistols cover \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" are somewhat bland and sometimes uninteresting to listen to. The other songs, however, are done with great justice. \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" is a cool introduction. \\"Mary Jane\\" may very well be a part of the band's repertoire because it's almost beyond excellence. \\"Set The World Afire\\" and \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" are created with the usual Megadeth flair. The bonus tracks (all four of them remixed by Paul Lani) are pretty good, and are worthwhile additions to this 2004 reissue.<br /><br />Grade: 8.1/10<br /><br />Also from Megadeth<br />Rust in Peace (9.3/10)<br />Countdown to Extinction (9.4/10)<br />Youthanasia (9.9/10)<br />Cryptic Writings (9.4/10)<br />Risk (8.2/10)<br />The World Needs a Hero (8.9/10)

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I've been a fan of The Black Keys for quite a long time... and had heard this album wasn't as gritty as some of their previous albums.  I beg to differ!  This is one of.. if not THE best album by the keys.  I love every single track.  I would highly recommend to anyone who loves and appreciates good music.  I would give it more stars if I could.
B003AO1SVS|3.0|I suppose there are only so many ways you can iterate blues progressions and drums and keep it from becoming stale, something the Black Keys seemed to have realized awhile ago.  As you go through the albums of the Black Keys you can hear a material maturation of both the music and the lyrics.  Understandably, at some point the Black Keys must have gotten bored with using the same old formula, beginning with a few tracks here and there and progressing with Attack & Release and now Brothers.      That being said, there are still some very good blues based tracks on this album both stripped down and some with added substance and depth. I commend the Black Keys for doing what a lot of blues purists (both musicians and fans) refuse to do, step outside of their sandbox and explore elsewhere. The soul of the Black Keys is still evident in this album, but they have strayed away from their roots which will upset some, but is reasonable to me. I don't feel it's a ploy to gain more mainstream recognition, but of course I could be wrong. Either way I'm happy this talented tandem is getting a little attention.     \\"Sinister Kid,\\" \\"Ten Cent Pistol,\\" \\"She's Long Gone,\\" and \\"Howlin' for You,\\" are my favorites.  Rubber Factory will likely always remain my favorite Black Keys album, but Brothers is a worthy installment to the Black Keys' catalog.  I would have liked to have given this album 3.5 stars, but I suppose Amazon wants you to man up and make a decision.  After listening to \\"These Days\\" and \\"The Go Getter\\" again I made my choice. Three stars.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Either you're a fan or you're a fair-weather fan. I am the former. Altho, I consider this album to be truly fair-weather. I am firmly en staunched in my late 40's. I have been in love with Yanni's music from the get-go. I heard \\"Long Way Home\\" while listening to Pandora, but I didn't know what it was at the time. I was just thinking, wow, this is a great, kind of sexy song, but I couldn't look at the title while it was playing because I was busy. I had to search backward through my Pandora queue a little later to figure out what song I had heard. I saw this Yanni title and thought: \\"well, no that wasn't Yanni, besides, I think I have all his albums\\". I tried the song before and after, and thought, huh, maybe I should listen to this Yanni piece on Amazon since I didn't recognize the album name. I was blown away, but I should have known. Only Yanni's music has ever moved me the way his does, and this piece/album is no exception. I am *so* happy to be able to listen to more of his work! I had no idea he had released a new album. And, even though it is different from his other music, it is really only slightly different because it still has his passion and soul in it. Thank you Yanni!!! Next best thing would be to get to see him live and in concert again...it was the best live concert I have ever attended....I hope he tours again!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Not much to add to other reviews, if you're into precise sound then you most likely know about this standard from Sony already. The original pads are comfortable but have a small ear hole, if you've got big ears or want a lot of space/air then you can get different pads and replace them. The cord is incredibly long, I can walk around my bedroom without having to unplug.
B004NFB4EO|5.0|please shut your trap if you still think this is a rip-off of a madonna song... madonna herself already gave her blessings to lady gaga, if the singer herself okayed it, no one can bitch about it anymore, especially those instead of coming up with a better music, just sit around of their computers moan and bitch about how the world did them wrong...
B0041KKYCY|4.0|The original version of this film was hated and banned around most of the world for its on-screen depictions of rape, depravity and violence. It's, basically, a tale of a writer who goes to a cabin in the woods to work on her second novel and three of the local men there decide that she's the perfect person to have a little fun with. Unfortunately, for them, that's their BIGGEST mistake...<br /><br />I have to admit, having seen the original whenever it came out, my expectations for this film were pretty high. The original was unflinching in its' depictions of depravity and, to this day, still gets the same reaction out of me when I watch it. I have a hard time sitting through it. It's incredibly uncomfortable to watch soley for the fact that it's like you're spectating and watching this happen & you're helpless to do anything about it.<br /><br />That being said, I went into this film thinking that it's going to have a hard time competing with the original yet, for the most part, the remake more than delivered even adding a few new things to the mix. I was impressed with Sarah Butler's performance as Jennifer Hills. You feel for this character and what she goes through and you cheer her on when she goes after the guys that do unspeakble things to her. Heck, I'm impressed with the cast as well. They play the most devilishly awful cast imaginable. I went away from this film satisfied in the fact that Stephen R. Monroe did an outstanding job giving us an update on the original's tale.<br /><br />However, there was a thing I disliked about the 2010 I Spit on Your Grave remake. If this were the original, I'd buy her becoming the seasoned death- dealing machine that she becomes. Yet, for some reason, I can't. Not saying that she wasn't capable of doing it after what she goes through but..I just couldn't buy it.

B002HFJ77S|5.0|I have loved sophie kinsella all through the shopaholics, it wasn't until recently I read the rest of her books (written by just sophie kinsella not madeline wickham). The twenties girl being the last of all her books I have now read them all and each book I fall in love with her writing more. NO other author creates these kind of fantastic characters that I wish were my best friends. I thought the shopaholics could not be topped, I check her website every  month to see if a new one is coming but Twenties Girl was in fact my favorite. I wish I was related to Sadie, and it actually made me think of my own elders whom I wish I knew when they were 20 because it's something that will never happen. It happens in this book and its just fantastic! I will now start on the madeline wickhams and I am sure I won't be dissapointed... Yay for Sophie Kinsella!!
B000P24CHU|4.0|Communiqué is the second album by British rock band Dire Straits, & was recorded in November and December 1978, at Compass Point Studios, Nassau and was produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett.

B002ZG993Q|4.0|The review of the title pretty much says it all.  I liked the movie a lot, but only because I was prepped for what it was...and that is pretty much the opposite of what it was advertised as.  See that picture of George Clooney running on the cover?  Yeah, he does that about twice in the whole movie.  Not an action movie, not even really a thriller.  Think more along the lines of  \\"The Professional\\" with less action, no Gary Oldman or Natalie Portman, and you start to get it.  I honestly think that if this had been marketed differently and had a different actor as the lead, it would have been an art-house darling.
0316098337|5.0|I was hooked from the first descriptive phrases by this 5-year-old story teller. The author captured the essence of childhood innocence and creativity. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|Before I begin, I should mention that I saw this movie in the theater and did not order it from Amazon.  That said, here are my thoughts:    I understand that this type of storytelling is not for everyone, and given today's climate of blockbusters only, its no surprise that people sometimes have trouble with movies that don't include:  a.  aliens, b. robots, c. zombies, d. alien-robot-zombies.  I for one, find this kind of deliberate thoughtful storytelling to be refreshing and thought provoking.    I know a lot of people who will discount anything with Keira Knightly out of hand, but to me this was a step up for her, even if it is more of a platform for Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield.    I won't give you a long drawn out summary of the plot, nor will I go into detail about every scene I liked or didn't like (there were a good number of both), but I will say this:  If you enjoy 1984 (the book not the movie), or Brazil (the movie not the country), you will likely enjoy this movie.  Also, if you wanted The Island with Scarlett Johanssen and Ewan McGregor to be, well, not a piece of tripe (sorry buy it was), try Never Let Me Go.  It won't affirm your love of life, but it will make you think think about what in life is really worth loving.
030726999X|5.0|The trouble the characters get involved become even deeper in this trilogy finale. Now, everything surrounding the story has a national repercussion, involving spies, different factions of the Swedish intelligence agency and the Prime Minister of Sweden himself. I simply could not put these books down. I finished reading this book in about 2 days. This is very fast considering that english is not my native tongue and I am naturally a slow reader. The only drawback of the trilogy ended by this book, is that once I finish reading it, my novel standards got higher. It was not as easy to get this excited about a book again. Thankfully I was able to rely on Steinhauer (The Tourist) and good ol' Grisham and  to move on with my novel reading life.
B003D0ZNXS|4.0|This Icon Box, which is excellent value for money [at lest in the UK - in the USA it may be more expensive] claims to contain all the recordings the great Russian pianist made for EMI. That seems not quite true, as he recorded Schumann's Nachtstucke for EMI in London in the late 60s, and they are missing for the set; probably because the rights belong to the Russian label, Melodya.<br />All items were recorded between 1954 and 1972; in Paris, London, Cleveland and New York.<br /><br />The repertoire here is somewhat limited, insofar as we have two complete cycles of the Beethoven concertos - the earlier made in Europe with different conductors between 1954 [No.3 in mono] and 1957 [4&5 in stereo]; and the latter in Cleveland with Szell in 1968. [Frankly, I greatly prefer Szell's earlier set with Leon Fleischer.] In addition there are three short sets of Beethoven variations, but no sonatas. There are the three Tchaikovsky concertos from 1972, and earlier [mono] versions of Rachmaninoff 3 and Saint-Saens 2. Solo works include a Mozart sonata, K570; Chopin's Funeral March sonata, and three of the Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues Op. 87 [1,5&24]. There is much to admire here: for me, the highlights are the earlier Beethoven 4, with Leopold Ludwig, the Saint-Saens, and the Shostakovich - truly stunning playing.<br /><br />But this set leaves out [because recorded for other companies] many of the works for which Gilels is best known. There is no Scarlatti, Bach, Schubert, Schumann, Grieg, Brahms or Liszt here; no chamber music, no Beethoven sonatas. For those one must go to his later recordings for DGG, and the small but excellent CBS and RCA legacy. Gilels also left many live performances; from London, Moscow, Salzburg, Italy and elsewhere: and though these sometimes reveal a pianist who is not note-perfect, they often give a better, and more immediate picture of the great Lion of the Keyboard who will be familiar to those who heard him in the flesh.<br /><br />So while it is good to have [almost] all his EMI tapings gathered together in a single bargain box, those interested in the pianist's wider repertoire will need to look elsewhere for works with which he is most closely associated; in particular the Brahms concertos and late solo works, the Beethoven sonatas, and his Schubert and Liszt sonatas and shorter works, including his incomparabe Grieg Lyric Pieces.<br /><br />But this set is not to be missed at the price [around $20 from some sellers], notwithstanding the Beethoven concerto duplications.it is good to have [almost] all his EMI tapings gathered together in a single bargain box, those interested in the pianist's wider repertoire will need to look elsewhere for works with which he is most closely associated; in particular the Brahms concertos and late solo works, the Beethoven sonatas, and his Schubert and Liszt sonatas and shorter works, including his incomparabe Grieg Lyric Pieces.<br /><br />But this set is not to be missed at the price [around $20 from some sellers], notwithstanding the Beethoven concerto duplications.
B004HO6HYS|1.0|I saw an advance screening of the flick tonight. The only reason I went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for 2, and it's a free screening. I remember reading the book and not being very impressed, however I can't say I can pinpoint exactly what's been left out since I had forgotten most of it. Not sure if I even care now that I've seen both ends of the spectrum.<br /><br />Caruso tries a lot to hide the book's flaws, and he really does try hard. But somehow he only makes them more obvious. I'll admit there was tonnes of action and good special effects, but really, when the story wasn't stealing from other sci-fi (Animorphs, Johnny Mnemonic, Superman- there's even an insulting John Carpenter's The Thing nod too), it was overloading the audience's brain with Clich&eacute;s that can be found in almost any teen movie... ever. And some gigantic plot holes you could drive a tanker through.<br /><br />The action scenes I nearly left the cinema they were so bad. It's like Caruso told the camera crew to zoom in really close while holding the camera and shake it all about, shine flashlights in the camera lens, and move it violently when some gets punched. Shaky Camera and quick cutting must die, I'm tired of it.<br /><br />The soundtrack was so bombastic and over the top. At times it sounds like the boom mic is being banged against the inside of a 50 gallon drum. At others it's like they're attacking their strings as fast as they can really fast. The film's opening score piece over the panning shot is especially insulting- it doesn't help that it lasts a minute long and the cue's buildup is hilarious.<br /><br />I know the movie is based on a book, but with even that said, there is a tonne of clich&eacute;s. Hot chick who loves photography? Check. New kid is instantly buds with the nerd? Check. Douchebag jock who loves the hot chick? Check. Kid finds out he has powers he can't control? Check. evil villain are following kid and guardian? Check. Kid's guardian dies and he must do the mission without him? Check.<br /><br />There's also an annoying homo-erotic undercurrent between Sam and \\"John\\". Also, don't get me started on the Thirty-Sue pileup that is Number 6.<br /><br />For every clich&eacute;, there's a gigantic plot hole. Why isn't the grocery clerk suspicious of an alien with a hoodie and sunglasses buying a crap load of turkeys? How is \\"John\\" unable to control his powers in class yet able to control them perfectly in his backyard a matter of hours later? Why do the Mogadorian(!!!!) speak with Jamaican accents? How is the dog able to become all super-dog all of a sudden? Why are Lorien so perfectly humanoid with a true lack of alien qualities? And how do Lorien copulate?

0060558121|5.0|I reread this book 12 times...although I did skip a lot of the Ibis tales on the rereads.<br /><br />It was compelling, fun, and really thought-provoking.<br /><br />What I don't get is why the Lucky Charms Leprechaun and the comic book treatments of Thor and other gods weren't enough to help them muddle through...  Maybe it's just my preoccupation with breakfast cereal and comics, but I did feel that those type of popular culture items could have helped the story a bit.
B003ES61EE|5.0|As an amateur photographer I'm not about to spend a fortune on something that does essentially the same thing as a quick blow of air or swipe with a makeup brush will do; I was happy to find this AmazonBasics version.  The brush is high quality, it works well at removing dust on a camera lens, and its size makes it easy to toss in a bag, camera case, pocket, etc... I also appreciate how well the cap stays on- which was my main concern when thinking about the item. Luckily it fits tightly, doesn't pop off, and so far (a few months of fairly regular use) hasn't \\"stretched\\" much.
1597801585|2.0|I read this book on a trip and while I was jet lagged...I picked it up because of the mammoth on the cover and because I'd gotten creeped out reading Sandman comics and was having trouble sleeping.  So, clearly this was a tactical error on my part.     I felt disturbed by gratuitous violence and basically a bit let down.  I can see why it's been winning awards--the author lays out a series of really bad consequences of monocultures, genocide, and other bad things--but the misogynism and the sexual fascination with hermaphrodites read as very early-Asimov-era and not 21st century.    I found the other reviews helpful because they got at the things I'd liked and disliked about the book, so thanks everyone.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|This personifies the maturing of the artist. As a Clapton fan and blues, in general, I love this album. BB King has proven for years the simplicity merged with perfection works. Clapton remembers where he came from. As opposed to other artists that try to re-invent themselves through the years, Clapton solidifies himself with mature play and steady flow. Bravo.  Long live Clapton. Cream was awesome, but Clapton is much more than just Cream. He's the peaches as well.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Having read about the actual events that this movie is inspired by, it's a semi accurate account of what happened. However, in order to add drama and excitement to the movie there were some parts exaggerated. Still for what it is, this is easily worth at least a rental. Even if the plot is simple and the outcome rather predictable(as it would be for anyone that actually googled the event first). If you watch the movie, then actually read about the actual event, it will at least give you somewhat of an appreciation for what the movie accomplishes. If you are looking for suspense and entertainment, you really can't go wrong here.

B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|Motorhead isnt resting on their roadworn laurels. This is a really good album, probably the best one I've heard from the Lem, Phil, Mikkey D lineup. Standouts are \\"Born to Lose\\", \\"Get Back in Line\\", \\"Outlaw\\", \\"Bye bye Bitch bye bye\\". The album has less of a wall of metal sound and more holes, like their old Fast Eddie/Philthy Animal era. Mikkey Dee has some great drumming. I've never seen anything like a Mikkey Dee drum solo live. Its like watching Bonham in his prime. Long Live Motorhead!
B0034G4P7G|3.0|The overly dramatic telling of how Facebook came to be with most of the generals points of the lawsuits have some truth to them.  Jesse Eisenberg does an awesome job going against his typical role and here he plays an antisocial, impatient, selfish jerk.  Whether this is how Mark Z. really is, well, that's probably up to debate even though Hollywood is claiming massive research being done before the release of this movie.  It's more about trust betrayals and fighting over the pie but maybe that's because the audiences wouldn't have a lot of patience for ongoing tech jargon.  Whatever the case it's worth a watch, especially if you have a Facebook profile.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; TOPIC IMPORTANCE: B plus; FOCUS OF DRAMATICS: B minus;  WHEN WATCHED: 02/15/2011; MY GRADE: B minus to B.

006112429X|4.0|Cliched as it might sound, this book was indeed impossible to put down. I was however, constantly struggling with feelings of astonishment at Eva's complete and utter denial of her son's pathology and her passive ability to let her husband's sunny dispostion guide the family dynamic. For Eva (and the author) to be labeled \\"feminist\\" seems on a par with calling Rush Limbaugh \\"liberal\\". Seldom has a novel made me so angry, seldom have I felt such loathing for an author (her end-of-book notes make her sound like an arrogant bitch--and proud to be so). Can a father possibly be as dense as Franklin? Can a mother be so in tune with her child's \\"badness\\" and yet not act on it through therapy, counseling, or even the juvenile justice system? This book was gripping and tragic, and yet to label it a \\"feminist classic\\" simply because a mother admits to feelings of ambivalence and dislike toward her child (not that she has that much of a higher regard for her daughter, whose sweetness and passivity she views as a sort of mental deficiency) is more than a little disappointing to me. The surprise ending did catch me unawares, but the twist in Kevin's personality left me cold. I felt no more sorry for him than I did for Eva or her husband. The tragedy of this story is that no one intervened, no one spoke up, and most importantly, no one took the little girl away.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|I'm a metal fan, and I bought this album because it got so many glowing reviews, many of which compared this band to Slayer and early Metallica.  As a hardcore fan of both of those bands, I gave Avenged Sevenfold a try.  And I'm here to tell you-- it's absolute crap.  I couldn't stand to listen to it, although I tried.  Comparing it to Slayer or Metallica is an absolute insult.  It sounds like David Bowie lyrics being obnoxiously screamed by a bunch of spastic teenagers who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.  Like most music fans, I have a lot of CDs in my collection that I'm lukewarm on... but THIS was a CD I knew I would NEVER listen to again.  I sent it back to Amazon, and they were nice enough to give me a partial refund even though I had taken it out of the plastic.      Obviously there are quite a few people who like this band, and to each his own... but as a classic heavy metal fan, I have to say that Avenged Sevenfold gets two thumbs down from me.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|There really isn't much point into going into the details of this movie as the buzz over it has made almost all of its details well known. I don't usually review movies, but the absolutely insane about of press, opinions and critical commentary really pushes a person into having some kind of opinion about it.   First, based strictly on the technical skills of the actors, cinematographers, editors and director it is a pretty good movie; but only pretty good. I love David Fincher's style, making Seven and Fight Club two of my favorite movies ever. The editing is a little jarring, but if you are able to follow Inception, you won't have any trouble with the way the time line jumps around. All this said, this movie isn't as good as the all the accolades that have been heaped on it would indicate. The only reason I can figure that the Oscars love it so much is so they can have a culturally relevant movie nominated that people under 40 actually went to see.  Now for the writing. Aaron Sorkin simply made up some stuff using the names of people attached to a well known company. If he was going to make up this much stuff, he should have just created a fictional story based loosely on the history of Facebook instead of trying to pass this off as something that might be accurate. It is common for people involved in the actual events of a movie to be involved in some way during their productions (John Nash with A Beautiful Mind, Hunter S Thompson with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc.) but in this case Sorkin used a book as his only reference and has said openly that he didn't want to be tied to the restraints of accuracy. Beyond this being kind of arrogant, it just goes to show that Hollywood has just run out of ideas and is content to sell us rewarmed or \\"rebooted\\" trash instead of actually coming up with something new (Star Trek, Alice, Planet of the Apes, GI Joe, The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds; I'm looking at you!)  Finally, there is what the audience issupposed to come away with from this movie. Zuckerberg is portrayed as a sort of passive aggressive villain, but if he was an athlete, politician, general, or CEO would anything that he \\"said\\" or \\"did\\" be so scandalous? Is the prejudice against \\"nerds\\" still so bad that we are willing to believe that a smart guy that doesn't take lip from people less successful than him would be completely alone in the world. In the music industry don't they call this sort of attitude being a \\"diva\\" and don't crowds eat that up? I think we are also supposed to believe that frat guys are misogynous, some entrepreneurs are just arrogant coke heads, and the computer world is male dominated. DUH! These are probably the most accurate things in the movie.    Pros:  The look and feel of the movie is awesome; great style.  I actually enjoyed watching Jesse Eisenberg tell off the twins and their lawyer. Saying what is really on your mind doesn't equal jerk; and if so it still doesn't make you wrong.  Despite some distorted facts and fiction, some of the story arcs are more or less true. My generation hasn't managed to avoid the pitfalls of ruthlessness and avarice in the business world. In the some ways its the same tune set to a different beat.    Cons:  Oddly placed attempts to create a feeling of drama or tension.  The one guy that played both Winklevoss brothers sucked so I don't know why they needed to clone him instead of hiring some twins that could act.  Too much hype can really create an level of expectation that can't be obtained. For sheer drama Inception was better than this movie, and for character development and writing Its Kind of a Funny Story was better, so why all the attention? Just jumping on the pop-culture band wagon I guess.  Sorkin wanted to create a high drama soap opera but the source materials just didn't have enough spice for his liking, so he had to wing it. Research the inaccuracies of the movie before believing you understand the actual history of Facebook; not that either the movie or the history of Facebook are really all THAT important.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is one of the three or four greatest and most important novels ever written.  It is a magnificent historical tour de force filled with all the riches of cultural context, of human striving, love, and compassion as well as the despair and cruelty of poverty in 19th century France (or perhaps anywhere).  It is loaded with profoundly memorable characters and their absorbing stories and interrelationships.  If it has a fault as a novel it is that on rare occasions Hugo indulges in some socio-historical essay writing, which somewhat disrupts the flow of the larger story and which might have been better inserted as footnote material.  Tolstoy does the same in War and Peace, which LM to some extent resembles.  It is no accident that the greatest modern musical is based (fairly faithfully) on this wonderful monument of French fiction.  It is a very long, dense book, so take your time and savor every scrumptious morsel. NB: this is not the book you take on the plane to destract yourself for a couple of hours.  This is not chewing gum for the mind a la James Patterson.  This is literature at its greatest, and you have to let yourself be absorbed into its astonishing depths. BTW, I am NOT and have never been HEIDI.  I am JBF.  Don't know why Amazon wants me to be Heidi, but couldn't figure out how to change.
B000065V3H|5.0|Excellent movie.
B004NS710C|1.0|The only good thing about this movie is Denzel Washington's acting which is always outstanding. But even he couldn't salvage a movie so cliche'd as to defy description. I can usually ignore gross errors in films or action liberties but this movie went way beyond what I could tolerate.     If it were advertised as a pure entertainment/over the top action/adventure movie then I would have ignored its failures but not when it is supposed to be a reality based disaster movie. At the beginning of the movie, it says it is based on a true story! If this movie was really based on a true story then woe is us because our train system is being run by idiots.     If you know nothing about trains, cars, trucks, diesel fuel, etc and can ignore some serious stupidity then you might like this movie. It definitely has a lot of action and tension. It would be a good movie for kids as there is nothing bad in the movie, no swearing, no sex, no violence and it has heroes, lots of action and bad guys.     On the other hand, ignore the following if you don't want to know what happens in the movie although the outcome should be obvious.     The fundamental problem is that the movie ignores the obvious and does so repeatedly. They initially try to catch the runaway with a pickup truck that can run on rails (no problem with that as it is a common railroad vehicle). But it fails. And nobody thinks to put one in front going same speed then slow down until the runaway catches up and transfer someone to the runaway?     Instead they use a helicopter to attempt to land a person on the runaway train but it fails also, then they stop trying? If you've got a train with an extremely toxic load, wouldn't you try and try until you succeeded? The alternative is massive destruction and loss of life, yet in the movie they only tried once. And you don't need a railroad expert either so you could use almost anyone.     However, they do put another train (two locomotives) in front but with only one person onboard and which slows down to catch the runaway train but why didn't they try to have someone then go from that train to the runaway? But of course this train crashes and the operator gets killed. Then they won't switch the train onto a siding to derail it but instead use some gimmicky Derailer that of course doesn't work either. Then they have a single locomotive (operated by Washington and Pine) which amazingly is able to slow down the runaway (which has two locomotives)! The \\"Incredible Plan to Stop the Train\\" was nothing more than catching it, hooking up and using the single locomotive to slow it down. Guess what? It doesn't work. They do eventually manage to stop the runaway and amazingly it stops on a dime even though all the brakes for the other cars are disconnected?     And toss in a train full of kids (got to have kids in danger to add to the excitement). And the money grubbing executives who only care about the dollar loss. And the government official who just happens to be there (nice coincidence) and who tells a 28 year railroad veteran how to stop the runaway.There were even more cliche's but I won't bother to detail them, this movie had so many it was ludicrous.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|This movie had a lot of action. Miss Jolie is a wonderful actress.  I felt the movie was little over the top for me. I will of course see it again, but not as much as I see my other movies.
0670022411|4.0|I found this a very enjoyable book that I read straight through. I eagerly await the next in the series. I loved the English and French settings. The only part that was less good was the ending. The story had pretty much wrapped up and the final chapters felt like they were just killing time and setting up the next book.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Wow!  What a story!  I'll need to watch it again a couple of times to figure it all out.  I highly recommend this action-packed head-scratcher!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|[[ASIN:B002N5N5LG Community: The Complete First Season]]    I just received and finished watching the first season of Community. I was running out of ideas for where to look for good comedy,  so based on the reviews here I took a chance and am not sorry. This first season took several episodes to gel, but I was soon engaged   in the series and premise- basically that a community college will draw all types, ethnicities and age groups for various reasons and  it becomes a stew for forming odd clicks. There are thick cultural references that you have to watch for as part of the fun. The male lead  character forms a Spanish language study group to woo a standoffish blond, but finds uninvited others have decided to attend, and these   become the main cast. There are so many side plots it is a little hard to give an account of but it all adds up to viewing fun. I am looking  forward to the second season being released on DVD, but in the mean time, this is one of those rare shows I will watch over and over.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|I know this movie got 5 stars, but I just didn't care for it.  Might have something to do with remembrances of growing up in Southwest Virginia.  Same reason I have an aversion to country music, I guess. Maybe if I'd viewed it from a different perspective I'd have liked it. So go ahead, watch it, and you'll probably like it just fine.  5 stars!  Who can argue with that?
B00009W0U4|5.0|I walked into this film expecting to see brutal rape and murder via fire extinguisher. Yet still I was surprised. I had not expected to endure inaudible low-frequency sound, gutwrenching camera movements, surprisingly transcendent and memorable acting performances, an ending (or beginning??) twist that would normally be cliched and unoriginal yet seems powerfully sad, and a final Strobe lightshow that brings the film's powerful message (Time Destroys Everything) full circle. Notable for its masterful cinematography (particularly in the \\"Rectum\\" scene), mindblowing soundtrack (the final piece of classical music was really effective) and an intriguing slow pace that surprisingly works. As for the reverse chronology, I think it makes the film much more effective, and changes it from graphic and gratuitous torture-porn to meaningful and satisfactory revenge flick. If the film had been in chronological order, there would have been very less special about it. But Noe's idea of having the viewer watch the end first, and then be subjected to a final thirty minutes of the characters happy and enjoying themselves, being powerless to warn them or help them, makes it all the more scary and memorable. A masterpiece of French cinema.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|My wife and I love this movie. It is fun and upbeat throughout. It leaves you happy at the end. The acting is well done and the actors are fairly believable and enjoyable to watch. A must for any collection of romantic comedies.
B000S9WLBY|5.0|A well written and directed movie. For the first time in my life I saw the Japanese soldiers in a different light. Their brutal training and brutal officers. Most of all I saw the Japanese soldier as a human being. Men with feelings, emotions, and loved ones back home. This movie has honestly led me to view the Japanese, both soldier and relatives back in Japan, in a whole different way. I'm glad to say, in a better and more compassionate way.
0062020889|4.0|I read this book many years ago and couldn't put it down.  It was one of the first Follett novels I had read.  It definitely contributed to my getting \\"hooked on Follett\\".  If you haven't read many of his books, make this one of your first.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I feel this movie would be encourgeing to a teen age person, that regardless of how they were raised that they can succeed with a strong will person encourageing them.  It was a very warm story, infact a true story.  Ones past is held in the back of the mind but, does not rule their future to succeed.His foster mother, later mother, knew that he could succeed.  I was pleased with the movie, infact I'll watch it again.
1594202842|4.0|After reading this book, I think this book is an affront to all us parents who want to raise mediocre kids.  Every time I see Ms. Chua being interviewed, she is getting put on the defensive by a reporter, parent, or teacher.  I think she should not have written so inflammatory a book that has these insights on modern western parenting.  Every child cannot be the best, can they?  Who will be our Wal-Mart tellers of the future?

1851774394|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is a beautiful book. It's coffee table sized, and printed on nice glossy pages that show off the wonderful photography. While the focus is on women's clothing, there are also several examples of men's fashion as well.<br /><br />As the title would imply, the book includes clothing from the beginning to the end of the 19th century. However, if you are looking for examples of Regency clothing, as I was, you might be a little disappointed. While it does include some gorgeous Regency Era dresses, I only counted six that were actually featured in the whole book. The majority of it is concerned with Victorian styles. This is likely due to the relative scarcity of Regency gowns that actually remain in existence, but just be aware that this book is largely focused on the later fashions of the century.<br /><br />On average, there are two pages dedicated to each piece of clothing, usually including a detailed photo, a front and back sketch of the entire garment, and a short (but not too short) description. One of my favorite pages discusses fabric patterns and trims. Besides dresses, there are also many accessories, men's jackets, shoes, outerwear, and even a few corsets. The details on some of these garments are absolutely stunning...it makes you wish people still put the same amount of artistry into clothing!<br /><br />My one complaint is that while we are sometimes given both up close and full view photographs, most of the time there is only a simple line drawing of the full garment. I'm not sure why this decision was made, but when I go through the book I often find myself wishing that they had given us full view photographs of all the outfits, because they all deserve it.<br /><br />In any case, this is a gorgeous, well-researched, and well-photographed book that will please all lovers of history, costume dramas, and fashion in general!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|When Peter Jackson and New Line released The Lord of the Rings on DVD, they got their money back and then some. First, they released the theatrical version; then some months later they released an extended version and that disc _also_ included the original theatrical release. People were steamed, but many both the whole kit _a second time_. But George Lucas won't do that. Why? Because he owns the whole thing from start to finish. He's the annoying studio head he has to deal with.<br /><br />That still leaves the question of why he doesn't even want to just make some extra money.<br /><br />The answer is straightforward. NOBODY thinks his \\"extended\\" version is better. If he were to release the original theatrical, sales of the \\"Lucas new and improved\\" would drop to ZERO. And lil' ol' George just can't bear the thought that his franchise took a nosedive straight down the toilet.

But Lucas couldn't stop. He had his little darlings. So he made three crappy movies and then crappy 3D cartoons.

B002ZG99TK|1.0|This movie has ton of action and \\"so-so\\" acting. As Denzel washington is one of the most overrated actors of our time with no real depth in many (not all) of his movies. If they were going to make the movie so unbelievably unrealistic, they should of went a step further like they did in the Movie: Wanted, at least it wasn't trying to pretend that it could really happen. At least that way you knew you were getting the Hollywood fake ridiculousness. But this movie tries to be something it's not. Realistic. Maybe cause I have a strong passion for trains and a couple of my friends work in the Locomotive industry. So many better movies that have just as much action, but don't try to be something they are not. Plus you won't have to watch a Train through the entire movie solely. Move on to something else and stay away from Unstoppable Crap.
B000V86OKG|3.0|The movie played fine but the case was pretty much destroyed the corners looked like someone bashed it against a wall repeatedly this has happened multiple times now when i order things directly from amazon and i can tell you it is not U.P.S.'s Fault! The movie itself though is incredible, but if your ordering the season you most likely already know this.
B003K025TQ|5.0|I originally purchased this gift for a family member of mine. I was unable to present this gift to said family member so I proceeded to open the gift as if it were my own. Boy am I glad I kept the gift for myself. One of the most amazing jazz compilations I've ever heard.  Even though this album is not explicitly by Lee Ritenour, this album is full of energizing rhythm and funk that I for one was surprised to hear. Sorry uncle, this album goes to the nephew.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I now have a Roku box and a subscription to Netflix.  This means I have a wide variety of movies and series of TV shows at my fingertips.  What a joy!  Last weekend I watched the entire 9 episodes of the 2005 first season of Grey's Anatomy in one sitting.  It was a real joy, especially since each episode is only 40 minutes long and does not have commercials. I've always liked medical dramas and used to be hooked on ER.  But that now seems dated.  I was totally enraptured by this new addiction of mine to Grey's Anatomy and can see me watching every season whenever I can find the time.<br /><br />The scene is now set. A group of new interns are introduced to the Seattle hospital. Ellen Pompeo is cast in the title role.  Her mother was a surgeon there but there is a mystery around why she left.  T.R. Knight is cast as a bumbling intern with a crush on Pompeo but her heart belongs to a staff doctor, Derek Sheppard.  And then there is Katherine Hengel. a former top model and Sandra Oh, somewhat caustic in her competitiveness.  By the end of the nine episodes all these people became real to me.<br /><br />And then there are the medical dramas - the cheerleader who collapsed during competition, the newborn baby with something wrong with his heart, the surgeon who was in danger of losing his eyesight, the complicated operations which forced the doctors to stand on their feet for hours at a time and think quickly and accurately, and the disappointments, both with the patients and with their romances.  I loved it all and can't wait to watch Season 2 which I understand has many more episodes and will be impossible to watch in one day.
B004BLJQOK|3.0|What? You can't watch a foreign film with subtitles? You're too dumb that you won't get it? You're a \\"movie illeterate\\"? You absolutly need to have every foreign film remade in its american version in order to appreciate it?     Of course, \\"Let Me In\\", the U.S. version, has more of everything (more gore, more special effects, more explanations, more music) and less subtleties. Of course, like all american remake, it suffers from a sad case of hypocritical puritanism (those who saw the sweedish version know what i'm refering to).     Instead of wasting his precious talent in remaking a foreign cult film (a nevertheless great remake that is uncalled for), the american director should have done an original story. Of course, he changed the structure a bit so that he can say that his version is different (the arguable and overlong mystery surrounding a secondary character as the movie begins). And also, he took away a little detail that was so eerie and cool in the european version: Eli, the sweedish girl vampire, flys in an fast, subtle and elegant way as she goes from a module to her new friend (the american Abby simply jumps out of focus). Why take away such a spooky detail?    And as good as Chloe Moretz is as Abby, the american girl vampire, and she is sublime, i feel that Lina Leandersson is way more \\"peculiar\\" in her ways and her looks in the european version. Those who've seen \\"Let The Right One In\\" have to give me that one. The sweedish boy was also more \\"natural\\", i feel. Is look was \\"picturesque\\" if i may say so but it belonged in the story. The american boy, Kodi Smith-McPhee, is good and i believed him, but it feels like he was cast more because he looked like his european counterpart, Kare Hedebrant.    No really, the sweedish version has absolutly NOTHING to be ashamed of. Nothing. It is as good as it can be. The special effects, the acting, the structure and the cinematography are superb. And it is only two or three years old. It certainly didn't need a remake. The U.S. version, as good as it may be (and it is good), almost feels like an insult to the intelligence of the american viewers.    You don't believe me? Try and find a way to see the sweedish version. Have an open mind about subtitles and about actors and actresses you don't know. I swear, you'll be the winner.     There are other ways to make movies, you know. A film doesn't have to be \\"american made\\" in order to be good.     Darn it.
0307463745|4.0|I like the very unconventional point of view of the authors. They triggered me to re-think about my perspectives. That's good. However, I am sure their business logic, which is very successful in their own software battlefields, is not readily applicable for enterpreneurs in traditional businesses such as retailing. I am obliged to warn readers of such potential hazard. Nevertheless, I must stress that the book is very interesting and will be helpful for those who want to have a breakthrough in business or in life. Recommended!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br /><br />Stanley gave his advice to aspiring film-makers: \\"Get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all.\\" Kubrick kenw that when you're new at something, you need to start creating. The most important thing is to begin. So get a camera, hit Record, and start shooting. Ideas are cheap and plentiful. The original pitch idea is such a small part of a business that it's almost negligble. The real question is how well you execute. pg38<br />As you get going, keep in mind why you're doing what you're doing. Great business have a point of view, not just a product or service. You have to believe in something. You need to have a backbone. You need to know what you're willing to fight for. And then you need to show the world...When you dont know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. For when you stand for something, decisions are obvious. pg43-4<br />Whenever you can, swap \\"Let's think about it\\" for \\"Let's decide on it.\\" Commit to making decisions. Dont wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward. You want to get into the rhythm of making choices. When you get in that flow of making decision after decision, you build momentum and boost morale. pg77<br />A lot of companies focus on the next big thing...That's fool's path. You start focusing on fashion instead of susbstance. You start paying attention to things that are constantly changing instead of things that last. The core of your business should be built around things that wont change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now. Those are the things you should invest in. pg85<br />If you're constantly staying late and working weekends, it's not because there's too much work to be done. It's because you're not getting enough done at work. And the reason is interruptions....Instead, you should get in the alone zone. Long stretches of alone time are when you're most productive. pg104<br />The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it. pg115<br />We're all terrible estimators. We think we can guess how long something will take, when we really have no idea. We see everything going according to a best-case scenario, without the delays that inevitably pop up. Reality never sticks to best case scenarios. That's why estimates that stretch weeks, months and years into the future are fantasies. The truth is you just dont know what's going to happen tha far in advance. pg124<br />Polar explorer Ben Saunders said that during his solo North Pole expedition (31 marathons back to back, 72 days alone) the \\"huge decision\\" was often his day to day decison making rarely extended beyond \\"getting to that bit of ice a few yards in front of me.\\" pg130<br />Put yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. Competitors can never copy the you in your product. pg139<br />In the end, it's not worth paying much attention to the competition anyway. Why not? Because worrying about the competition quickly turns into an obsession. What are they doing right now?  Where are they going next? How should we react? Every little move becomes something to be analyzed. And that's a terrible mind-set. It leads to overwhelming stress and anxiety. That state of mind is bad soil for growing anything. pg148<br />You are not going to out-Apple Apple. They're defining the rules of the game. And you cant beat someone who's making the rules, not just build something slightly better. pg149<br />Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They makes things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. pg222<br />When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You'll be better off if it's you. Otherwise you create an opportunity for rumours, hearsay, and false information to spread. pg231<br />Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service....And even if you dont have a perfect answer, say something, \\"Let me do some research and get back to you\\" can work wonders. pg236. They're defining the rules of the game. And you cant beat someone who's making the rules, not just build something slightly better. pg149  Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|Some evolution here, but no revolution, which is good if that's what you expect.  A little more vocal experimentation and a little less gain, but once again, the cake comes out great.  Auerbach goes for some higher octaves on this album and it may throw you the first time you hear it, but he doesn't take it too seriously or too far.  Just a demo of what he could actually sing if he wanted to.  They take measured steps forward on each successive album, adding a few new ingredients each time and testing the waters.  I prefer evolution to revolution (so few bands have the raw talent for revolution), and this album sits comfortably on the leading branch of their evolutionary tree.  Simple is not easy, and these guys know how to kill with simplicity.
B002ZG981E|1.0|I tried watching this movie twice, the first time I stuck it through hoping it would get better. The second time, I thought I might understand it a bit better but lost interest and shut it off after half an hour. It is worth noting that I like action films and films with twists, I love movies about alternate realities. But in case I didn't make it clear enough, I hated this one.<br /><br />Inception is a science fiction film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine, to name but a few. DiCaprio plays a type of spy who, with his partner Arthur, extract valuable information from the subconscious of their targets while they are asleep and dreaming. Cobb struggles with the circumstances of the death of his wife and not being able to be with his children.<br /><br />Cobb is given an assignment to use his skills to affect the subconscious of his enemy's son, Cillian Murphy, in order to sabotage his empire. In return, Cobb will be able to reunite with his kids, who he hasn't seen since his wife's death.<br /><br />The plot is interesting but the dreams within dreams within dreams were really really confusing to me. Ellen Page is fantastic as is Cillian Murphy but I didn't really care for Di Caprio's acting. I always enjoy watching Michael Caine.<br /><br />So end result: I really really did not like it! My teenage kids disagree though and absolutely loved it.
B00328G4V6|5.0|INCREDIBLE!!!!    It's all about and only about the music...no more no less.    Glad they choose to release it.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I have to say that I liked this book a lot more than I thought I would.  I am thankful my mother was not driven like this woman was or it would've been a war zone at my house my entire childhood.<br /><br />I like that she was dedicated to her children. Maybe a little too business minded for a lot of people but she was trying to do what she thought best for her girls.<br /><br />Parts that bothered me was forcing the kids to practice while sick or tired.  This was a bit much imo. I hate working when I am not feeling well and equate practices to work for kids.  I can't imagine how miserable it would be to play with the flu, lol.<br /><br />But writing style was interesting and easy to follow.  Finished the book in about two days and would say it was worth the time it took to read. :)
0670022411|5.0|I was very surprised to see a number of 1 star ratings for this book, but once I read them I realized they were all complaints about price. Is it really fair to lower the average rating for a book based on a price the author likely didn't have much say in? Really?    That being said, I enjoyed this book very much. I was hooked from the start... I found the characters to be likable, and the subject matter interesting. I'm a huge fan of 'supernatural' and loved the magic aspects of the book - just wish there were more of them.     I will say that some of the trouble the main character, Diana, got into seemed to be resolved pretty quickly and didn't have much suspense. I can't say I minded that too much because it's always annoyed me when things get dragged out too much when you know what the ultimate outcome is likely to be.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Wonderful, can't wait for her next one.  No gratuitous sex and violence, unlike so many modern novels, but very compeling characters and story.  I couldn't put it down.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie is very touching. It opens your eyes and shows you what jesus christ had to go through so that we may have the gift of eternal life.
6304806418|3.0|One would not usually think of a movie musical as being troubling and difficult to watch, but this one was exactly that for me.<br /><br />The movie Evita affected me at two distinct levels, one as the hit musical, and two as a commentary on life and politics; first the easy one, Evita as a hit musical.<br /><br />The music of Andrew Lloyd Webber provides the foundation for this work; his music is so distinctive that it immediately identifies the work as his. Webber's music is powerful and intense; the pace hardly ever slackens as the story unfolds about this young woman who was born in very humble surroundings but is driven to make something of herself.<br /><br />The title role is played by Madonna who turns in a powerful performance of this driven woman. Using every means at her disposal the Evita character pushes herself into a place of influence in Argentina.<br /><br />Fans of either Madonna or Andrew Lloyd Webber will find this a treasure trove of musical gems; Madonna was a good choice in the role as her appearance and bearing seem to support the Evita character being portrayed.<br /><br />The second level is more involved and troubling; we see two people, Juan and Eva, who desire power using demagoguery to effectively influence political events. What is even more troubling is the ease with which large groups of people were emotionally swayed to support these desires; we see the weaknesses of the democratic process being exploited to establish control.<br /><br />Peron's partnership with Eva produced a potent force which finally placed them in the top positions of power in Argentina. Their demagoguery kept them there longer than might have been expected. Their policy of promising everything to everybody but actually benefitting only a chosen few was clever enough to deceive enough of the people to maintain their positions of leadership.<br /><br />All of this is history, but the disturbing thing is the parallels one sees today in the United States. These parallels made the movie troubling and difficult for me to watch. It may be as Hegel is quoted saying: \\"What experience and history teach is this--that people and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it.\\"to watch.

0061989142|4.0|My rating is biast because I really enjoy Lauren Conrad's style that being said my sister found the book interesting even though she is not a big fan. This is not a book for people looking to enhance their wardrobe. This book is like a tool for beginners, it gives enough information for the people who love looking at magazines but do not know where to start. Conrad explores the world of the perfect jeans, the perfect make up look, but all this looks are HER OWN STYLE, so if you're not a fan of who she is you might find this book a bit boring.
0553378384|5.0|I absolutely love Jan Spiller. I have read Cosmic Love before and couldn't wait to get Astrology for the Soul. This book is incredibly detailed and insightful. She is eerily dead-on in her astrological readings. I keep this book by my bed and read it again and again whenever I am in need of some inspiration.
B004NS710C|5.0|UNSTOPPABLE is a thriller about a runaway freight train hauling lethal cargo, hurtling toward unspeakable tragedy. The action starts a few minutes into the film and doesn't stop for 1 hour and 38 minutes later when you finally exhale.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is classic in the film; a twenty-eight year veteran engineer with a quick wit and cool hand on the throttle. There are some well-worn themes; hard-working union members against incompetent corporate thugs; rough-hewn rail hands vs the mean old railroad man; know-nothing rookies vs experienced veterans; misunderstood husband with a quick temper but good heart; etc. Even these are not so tedious as to prevent enjoyment.<br /><br />It is interesting that a runaway train story, replete with cliche' screenwriting and threadbare liberal stereotypes could be so much fun. It is an hour and a half of non-stop entertainment; groans, laughs, intakes of breath, raucous cheering. This is a suspenseful action film, fraught with tension and excitement. You may find yourself on the edge of your seat and cheering aloud.<br /><br />PG-13 for strong language.
0937381888|5.0|This is a great book that covers everything you need to know right off the bat. Usually you can buy a beer kit, and have a sheet of paper that will get you through the process. This book, however, in the first 20 pages will teach you things that can dramatically make your brew better. The book start off with a crash course guide of each of the processes. Then after you are done with that, it goes through all the different parts and what is actually happening and why.<br /><br />The book is written in a very easy to read way without sacrificing any depth of information. Highly recommended for those who would like to break the hold of the bottled water that is the American Lager and create some good tasting beer.

B004EBUXI0|5.0|This new \\"Sandy Bridge\\" processor is providing excellent performance for a $200.00 CPU (especially cost effective since the GPU is onboard--no graphics card is required).  It is installed in a computer with 8GB of RAM used for typical business applications running simultaneously and occasional audio/visual processing.  So far, no complaints.  Windows 7 (64 bit) boots quickly and CPU utilization overall remains low most of the time even under moderate multitasking load.  Some reviews mention the inadequacy of the heatsink/fan included, but mine hums along just fine at about 30 degrees (Celcius).  Be aware that there is a known defect in Intel's supporting chipsets (P67, H67) that will require certain motherboards to be replaced mid-2011 when the updated chipsets become available, so do your research before purchasing.  The defect is not in the CPU itself.    A comment for those of you ordering from other suppliers using their free shipping options who are used to receiving the product(s) in the next day or so anyway...I ordered this CPU on 1/17/2011 using Amazon's free shipping option and it was delivered on 1/25/11.  (This is not a complaint--I understood the level of service--just a \\"heads up\\" to those of you who might presume faster delivery based on experiences with other vendors.)

B002ZG99NG|4.0|It seems to me that Ben Affleck, who has been underrated as an actor, redeemed himself with his directorial debut of 2007's GONE, BABY, GONE - and now has proven he is not a one-hit wonder with 2010's THE TOWN. Packed with authentic locations (the rough Charlestown section of Boston), car chases, and rich characters - and mixed with a great story and excellent performances, Affleck just might end up with a hit on his hands. He plays Doug MacRay, a former professional hockey prospect who has turned to crime, namely bank robberies; Rebecca Hall is Claire, Doug's wholesome love interest; and Jeremy Renner is loose canon and Doug's best friend from the neighborhood, James (Gem) Coughlin. Supporting these stars are Chris Cooper as Doug's incarcerated father, Blake Lively as James' drug-addicted sister, and Jon Hamm as the FBI agent who is in hot pursuit. Although this film could sink into cliched Boston bad-guy stereotypes and overly emphasized accents, it doesn't. It feels real and the characters, who are likable and engaging, seem like regular folks, albeit criminals. If you enjoyed the action and suspense of THE DEPARTED with Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, you will surely find THE TOWN to be in the same class - in this case, a sophisticated heist thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B00000K3UU|4.0|The Big Daddy DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again.

B000002I2M|3.0|I understand that since this is the last Doors album, many consider it their best.  But several tracks here are pedestrian.  Morrison's vocals reflect his physical decline due to booze and drugs.  Though the keyboards and guitar are often impressive, the songs here are quite uneven.  The standard blues numbers are just that -- standard, in no way exceptional.  Morrison's poetic excursions in L'America and The Wasp are far from his best.  L.A. Woman, except for the tiresome \\"mojo risin\\" interlude, is an impressive song with striking lyrics.  Love Her madly is a pleasant listen and Riders on the Storm is a fine song.  But add it up and it's not a consistently fine album.    Strange Days remains the Doors' apex, with a multitude of haunting songs that recur in my mind decades later.  Their first album and Morrison Hotel also rank among their best.  It's hard to beat the rock and roll desperation of Roadhouse Blues.

0545123283|5.0|How do you start the review of one of the best books you have ever read?<br /><br />Do justice to it? I'll do my best.<br /><br />I don't believe in spoilers. I believe in telling people the reasons why this book is such a necessity for readers of the genre. Here it goes. I'll try to describe what to expect.<br /><br />Linger is the story of Sam, Grace, and Isabel with the introduction of a new character to the mix: Cole<br /><br />Grace: Changing, unpredictable, strong, stoic, beautiful as ever, in pain, loving, considerate, and, for the first time, extremely risky and disobedient. (Cheers to that, Grace.)<br /><br />Sam: Skeptical about his cure, deep, loving, sensitive, growing, maturing, and evaluating life and its possibilities for the first time.<br /><br />Isabel: Being Isabel =) Direct, without filters, cold, detached, consumed, lonely, reaching out, needing to feel something, and trying to connect.<br /><br />Cole: Learning, expanding, converting, unlocking, hiding, hating, unmasking from the inside out, trying to tolerate his own reflection, moving on, and forgetting.<br /><br />Now mix them all together and shake the bag. TA-DA! MAGIC!<br /><br />In Linger Maggie's beautiful writing takes you from one narrative to the next, making the story seamless, never boring, and always moving forward. I read the book in one sitting. I spent four hours ignoring the world because I couldn't put it down. I was given an ARC by a friend; we both had been counting the days to receive it. Then when we got it I was terrified to read it because I knew after it I had to wait a year to know what's next. Totally worth it...I have 12 months of re-reading to do<br /><br />Linger is an amazing second installment for this trilogy. This second book makes the trilogy's concept stronger, the characters more colorful, human, deep, and believable. Maggie takes you for an amazing ride, going through Sam's heartfelt emotions, Isabel's constant need for security, Grace's changes from the inside out, and Cole. Well...you get to meet Cole, and all I have to say is...what a first impression. He's a burned out rock star that will blow your mind...in a good way.<br /><br />I LOVED LINGER... I highly recommend this book for lovers of well written and thoughtful YA. For lovers of paranormal who are tired of reading the same old thing: this is IT.t a first impression. He's a burned out rock star that will blow your mind...in a good way.    I LOVED LINGER... I highly recommend this book for lovers of well written and thoughtful YA. For lovers of paranormal who are tired of reading the same old thing: this is IT.
030746363X|1.0|This author is a quack, plain and simple.  But he doesn't care, so long as you buy his book.  I got taken in by my own fantasy that one can lose weight quickly and easily.  Not true, and we all should know that.  However, I resent someone profiting by giving really careless, possibly dangerous advice.
1589269071|5.0|This is a great book (we ordered it as an mp3).  My fiance' and I took it along on a long weekend away and listened to a few chapters over coffee in the morning.  So much makes more sense after listening when you think back on failed relationships.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone in a relationship.
B004OC22TW|5.0|This epidsode was great just like all the other episodes. The show just keeps getting better and better. I love this show. Damon is my favorite of course. The ultimate bad boy.
0375507256|5.0|I'm not a fan of reviews where the reviewer basically just tells you the story.  I like being surprised and just want to know the basics and that it's got good reviews.  This book was perfect for that.  This is some of, if the best writing I've ever seen.  It does not stop moving.  For a 500 pager, this read too quickly.  I want more.  I recommend this to everyone I know, whether they're readers or not.
0393072231|4.0|If you have ever wondered about the American financial crisis and not found comprehensible answers in financial newspapers and magazines, then this book is for you. Michael has a confident and easily understandable writing in this latest non-fiction. He presents not just the big banks workings but gives us a personal introduction to the people behind it. He mentions a bunch of hedge fund operators who knew what tragedy was coming and invested wisely. The book takes us on the journey with insights from these hedge fund investors' point of view. It at once puts us on the front seat of this CDO and credit swap machinery. It helps us understand the complicated mortgage disaster as seen by the eyes of visionary investors who knew the bubble was about to burst into disastrous proportions.    The characters in this book is what brings the book alive. It helps us know the business in Wall Street as analysed by these characters, what they do, why they did do something and how they profited during the biggest recent collapse in the financial market.    There is no better guide than this one with characters and explanations taking you inside the system and showing you what happened, why and how.
B0042YHC38|1.0|Besides the other poor design decisions already listed here - I just received my Adidas MiCoach Armband \\"for iPhone\\" and...  with the phone inside (tight fit indeed - definitely not a \\"quick application\\") the flap closes overtop and... no access to the headphone jack so there's no way to plug in headphones. Why would I go out running with my iphone and not want to plug in my headphones?? Astonishingly bad design choices were made on this flop.    RMA requested. Don't waste your money.
B0017XOF5A|4.0|unfortunately this was 'stargates' farewell no other films ever came. This was basically a two part stargate episode with a  higher budget and it was one of the last things that Don Davis ever filmed before his death. He played General Hammond and many other characters during his career of course. (rip d.d.) Anyways this is in no way deserving of bad reviews IF you like stargate sg-1. It's a average tale for the team as they travel through time, personally I would have liked a nontime travel story for their final adventure. Sadly At this date I can't see them making another one. I wish they would though. The blu ray looks stunning and it's a even better deal on the two movie pack with 'the ark of truth' blu ray. I still have hopes for this series to be on blu ray but that's not happening at this time. However the excellent series \\"space 1999' has made it to blu ray and that's a plus. ALthough it doesn't help us sg fans!  Anyways I enjoyed this movie but it's not the best story of this series by far. This one is for sg fans all the way and that's who should want this one the most. Casual sci fi fans will still enjoy this one  too  though.
0634089358|4.0|Well organized and easy to follow. Play along tracks sound average at best. I would have liked better effort there. All in all, a great study tool!
B0018J48QY|5.0|SUCH A GREAT SHOW! FROM THE WRITING, THE DIRECTING AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST THE ACTING. MICHEAL C. HALL LAYS IT DOWN. HE REALLY EMBODIES THE SPIRIT OF THE CHARACTER HE IS PLAYING, AND IT'S QUITE EVIDENT WITH EACH SCENE HE'S IN. DEXTER I FEEL IS A UNDERSTATED, UNDERGROUND SHOW THAT'S GROWING THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH. THIS SHOW IS A HIT, IT WILL LOCK YOU IN FROM THE VERY FIRST SCENE. I WOULD SUGGEST STARTING WITH SEASON ONE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO INVEST TIME INTO THE SHOW.

B000001FDQ|4.0|There are people aplenty to talk about the music. As for the recording- it's a very well mastered and recorded album and a huge joy to play on a top notch stereo system. There are lots of dynamics, the mic-ing is very good, the mixing is just right. You do not get that on all rock albums, especially over the past 10 years.
B004HAG40O|4.0|It seems like almost all of my favorite breakout indie bands from the last decade are making drastic sound-shifts as we head into the '10s, and many of these shifts have been a bit awkward and hard on the ear.  Take Sufjan Stevens' Age of Adz --- Different, to be sure, but incredibly difficult to sit through and not an album I'll listen to more than once a year (I'll keep giving it a chance as soon as I forget my last listening experience).  More recently, Iron & Wine has gone further into the random-noises-'cause-I-have-the-ability-now business, although enough listens to Kiss Each Other Clean will reveal strong songs beneath the overkill instrumentation, and Bright Eyes have released a new (and final?) album that's remarkably different, mainly in its lack of passion and conviction.  Those three examples are of bands that are moving in a new direction but losing something in the shift.    On the other hand, we have The Decemberists.  Throughout their run, they've gone in a number of directions but the thing that makes it work each time they do it is simple:  songwriting and conviction.  Colin and company bring both of those to every project they undertake, and the same is true here with The King Is Dead.  This might be their most \\"normal\\" and accessible album, which has led to some reviewers to bemoan the loss of the lost complexities (both lyrical and musical) of earlier Decemberist records, but fear not, Buyer of Music!  Not only does this album feel less like a change in direction than a simple exercise in a different song-writing style, they manage to nail that style so flawlessly that any true fan should at least find the album *listenable*.  I have a feeling these songs will sound great live, too.    All of that being said, album after album, I continue to have faith in The Decemberists' ability to do whatever they want and still produce quality musical results.  Some other acts out there (who seem to be more interested in making noise) might want to take a hint from these folks...
0061433047|5.0|Young witch Tiffany Aching keeps herself busy trying to keep society from breaking down and clipping toenails for an elderly woman who otherwise couldn't get around. She barely has time for sleep, let alone a social life. Still, seeing the son of the local baron, the boy she once rescued and who she once thought would be her husband, with a new fiancee, is painful to her. When the old baron dies and Tiffany is accused of being somehow responsible, the heir seems willing to believe everything bad about Tiffany no matter the years they've spent together.<br /><br />Being a witch always comes with a certain amount of danger. The priests of Ohm may not actively pursue witch-burning any more, but there are plenty willing to blame the witch for anything that goes wrong. The 'rough music' can start up just about any time and when it does, someone generally pays. Despite everything Tiffany does, it looks like it she might be the one who pays this time.<br /><br />Tiffany does have allies--the Wee Free Men (Feegle) are willing to fight for her any time. Of course if you don't want a fight, they're still willing to fight--it's what they do. Oddly, the other witches are less help than she would have thought. They do offer clues though, and Tiffany discovers that a long-dead witch-burner has somehow returned from beyond the grave and is behind the surge of hatred that affects not only her but all witches. Unfortunately, the witches have decided that either Tiffany will handle the spirit or they'll handle...Tiffany.<br /><br />Using a magical broomstick, \\"help\\" from the Feegle, a bit of magic and plenty of common sense, Tiffany adds saving the world to the list of tasks she's got to accomplish.<br /><br />Author Terry Pratchett concludes his Tiffany Acking miniseries with a strong and enjoyable entry in I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT. Tiffany has grown from a girl to a young woman, has endured heartbreak, and is coming to terms with her life as a witch. Pratchett combines humor with fantasy action and social commentary to create a story that will attract the teen-reader this series is ostensibly targetted to, but will also be enjoyable for the adult reader.<br /><br />Although the Tiffany stories are set in Discworld, this has been a part of Discworld set apart from Ankh-Morpork. Here, Pratchett completes the integration, letting Tiffany visit a witch store in that great capital and deal with the Guard and witches from Ankh-Morpork. The real enjoyment of this story, though, comes from watching an extraordinary young woman deal with problems--while trying to preserve an essential goodness that all of us, I think, aspire to.<br /><br />I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT can be enjoyed without reading the entire Tiffany Aching series.

B000002KBU|5.0|If you do not know this album - you are wretchedly poor - you have nothing, and I pity you.  If you do know this album, and do not love love it deeply - possibly above all others - you must not consider yourself a music lover.  Nobody ever made an album as beautiful or accomplished as Blue.
1423113454|4.0|Riordan has certainly done it again. I would second all of the rave reviews that have been filed here, but would add a mild world of caution. The stories of the Egyptian gods are much more complex and fluid than those of the Greek gods, and that means it takes a lot longer to get the reader up to speed in this book than it took in the Percy Jackson series. This is especially the case because the dual narrative structure means the reader has to sort out the back and forth dynamic of the siblings while also following the story. And, Riordan keeps the kids in the dark longer about their powers and their situation, and parcels out info and backstory in a much more leisurely and ambiguous way than he did in Olympians.<br /><br />  The upshot is that this book demands more patience from the reader, and more sustained concentration at the outset. The payoff is that the connections between and among the characters and the gods are also more complex and satisfying than the sometimes simple and easily explained interactions in the Percy Jackson series. This is probably a good development for fans and future fans. They can start with Percy Jackson, and then grow into the Kane Chronicles, (with the Percy Jackson Heroes sequel series as a nice and comfortable fall back).
030746363X|5.0|I'm loving this book. I've read most of it. Didn't really care too much about the hard core body building stuff. I just really need to lose some weight. Decided I finally need to do it for my New Years resolution. So just following the slow-carb diet I'm down about 13 pounds in about 1 1/2 months - without adding any exercise at all to my daily routine . . . yet.    I really like that Ferris is a \\"body hacker.\\" He experiments and consults with doctors and experts to see what works best. And I love the minimalist approach also. I don't want to waste time doing 20 minutes of something if 5 minutes will do 90% as much. He's good at helping you find where the line is on diminishing rate of return.    Overall a really great book that helped give me that push to get into shape.

B004A8ZX28|3.0|THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS IN THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS<br /><br />I'm just going to say what everyone is probably thinking, Unknown looks like the indirect sequel to Taken. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing on paper, it is kind of unnecessary given that a Taken sequel is currently in development. While Liam Neeson used to be the go to actor to portray a mentor or father figure that would die early on in whatever film he was a part of (Star Wars: Episode I, Gangs of New York, Kingdom of Heaven, Batman Begins, and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, just to name a few), Taken seemed to break that mold. But now it seems like Neeson is drawn to roles similar to the one he had in Taken since the film was such a surprise success. At the end of the day, however, Unknown is definitely its own film with obvious similarities to Taken.<br /><br />The biggest difference between Taken and Unknown is that element of mystery in Unknown. For the first three quarters of the film, you're trying to figure out who the real Dr. Martin Harris really is. And when it's finally revealed, it's actually a surprisingly decent twist. Taken also had much more action than Unknown mostly in part to Liam Neeson completely owning anyone that stood in his way of finding his daughter. While Unknown has its exciting moments, it's more thrilling than anything. It's all mostly car chases and Martin running away from people trying to kill him. While there is a scuffle or two involving Neeson beforehand, his only real fight similar to anything in Taken is the one in the finale (the \\"I didn't forget everything,\\" scene). While this may sound disappointing, it's really not and gives Unknown a few more distinguishing features to seem less like a doppelganger of a film you've already seen.<br /><br />The cast is pretty strong all around. Liam Neeson doesn't disappoint and is just as strong as he was in Taken. Diane Kruger manages to outshine January Jones, but that's mostly due to Kruger having more screen time and doing more besides saying she doesn't know her husband. Frank Langella is worth talking about though. Ever since Frost/Nixon, Langella seems to have stuck to smaller roles (where he also usually winds up dying). It's just a shame since Langella usually steals scenes in whatever film he's a part of and you generally want his character to be around longer than he is. On the bright side though, at least he doesn't take it upon himself to choose characters that you wouldn't want around at all.<br /><br />Unknown isn't what it could it have been though. Despite its flaws, it was actually incredibly entertaining and extremely exciting up until the last fifteen minutes or so. Then it's like they decided to throw logic out the window. THESE ARE SOME VERY HEAVY SPOILERS THAT LIE AHEAD, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ENTIRE FILM SPOILED I SUGGEST YOU STOP READING HERE. The original twist is fairly original; Martin is actually an assassin that was sent to Berlin on a mission, hit his head in the car crash, and wound up believing he was the fake identity he took on for the job. That's fine, but when he decides to grow a conscience and save the day is when it seems kinda hokey. Considering the payoff for the whole thing is fast growing corn, the film winds up coming off like a bad joke rather than an exhilarating two hours. Also, it can't really be that easy to obtain passports, can it?<br /><br />Unknown starts off as a pretty intense thriller with teeth grinding car chases and knucklebiting action sequences across rooftops and parking lots, but all of the good things Unknown has going for it are thrown away during its final minutes. Instead we're going to give a bleeding heart to a guy who originally started as a villain and end the world's hunger problems in a two minute video montage. Unknown may look like an action packed film you've seen before, but it actually isn't anywhere near as good as Taken is. If you liked Taken, Unknown is still worth giving a shot. Just don't be surprised if you walk away disappointed.away disappointed.
0061726826|5.0|(Review originally posted at GoneWithTheWords.com)<br /><br />Delirium had me from the first sentence: \\"It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure.\\" I thought to myself, this is going to end badly. And I didn't mean it as the book was going to suck, I meant that it was going to end with me in pain for these characters. That prediction was dead on.<br /><br />Lena's life has never been normal. Her family has been surrounded by controversy due to her mother committing suicide when Lena was six and her cousin's husband being identified as a sympathizer. She now lives with her aunt Carol, tries to follow all the rules and stay under the radar. She is counting down the days to when she can receive the procedure that will forever take away all the pain and memories of everything that has haunted her all her life. For Lena, the procedure will mean a fresh start. A new, normal life. But how could she want anything different if she really doesn't know what love, the disease, could truly bring to her life. To her, all it has brought is abandonment.<br /><br />Enter Alex, with his hair the color of autumn leaves and his bright amber eyes. He is gorgeous, sweet and fun. They begin this incredible forbidden relationship full of love, trust and kisses. Lots of kisses. :D He shows her what love is really like.<br /><br />So what does she do now? Go on with life as planned, get \\"cured\\" and live out her predetermined future or risk it all for love, for Alex? The ending will leave your heart racing and, I daresay, broken.<br /><br />With all that being said, I absolutely loved this book! That's the best I can do on describing how I feel about it. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series, as the cliffhanger is hard to bear, but I guess I'll have to suffer along with everyone else. It was a page turner from start to finish and I suggest you go out and read it...now!! :)
B001NLKT60|5.0|i wish larsson is still alive..what a loss...this series is a wonderful example of how to write a thriller..considering that this is only his second book.. what a treat we would have had if he is still alive... a mix of robert harris(in plot), john grisham(in narration) and richard north patterson(in characters)... rest in peace
B003DZX44I|5.0|I recently purchased this movie on Amazon because it was at an amazing price. I have loved this movie since I was a kid and to finally see it in Blu-Ray I was so stoked to buy it. After watching the movie I am proud to say that yes it is still a classic and charming movie. I am 23 year old guy and this movie still makes me all warm inside haha! This is a great combo pack because I can watch it at home then take it with me on the road in a portable dvd player too. Anyone who loves classic disney movies should pick this up while its a great low price!!<br /><br />Pro's: Transfer to Blu-ray is amazing!<br />Combo Pack and extras are well worth the price<br /><br />Con's: The only thing I wish it had was a digital download copy too. But that is just me.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|I'm quite pleased with this CD. Its good rock n roll with a bit of a bluesy sound here and there. Nice raw guitar and sound.In parts it reminds me of early Savoy Brown. The guitar sound is like Kim Simmonds and the vibrato vocals, although a higher voice, are much like Savoy Brown's Chris Youlden (my all time favorite vocalist) I really enjoy this cd.
1594484775|5.0|I loved this book - it's my favorite by Nick Hornby, and that's saying a lot. He has such a gift for creating quirky, sympathetic characters and bitingly funny situations - and here he also creates a truly touching romance, without being the least bit hokey or sentimental. Great book.
0066620996|5.0|I recently re-read this iconic book and I think I learned more the second time through. A decade after it was released, Good to Great still packs a major punch for those looking to grow a different kind of company--one that stands far away from the crowd. Many small businesses struggle to break through the barrier and Collins uses case studies and real-life examples to show how other \\"great\\" companies were able to make if through while most don't. Business owners would do well to not only read this book, but also keep it nearby on their bookshelf, as the lessons are as timeless as they are powerful.<br /><br />Stefan Swanepoel<br />Author: [[ASIN:0470947802 Surviving Your Serengeti: 7 Skills to Master Business and Life]]
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferris`s book is absolutely fantastic.  I have a medical problem with my muscles that makes it very hard to exercise for a long period of time.  I have tried many different ways to lose weight including getting a nutritionist and going to the gym at 6am every other day.  Instead of losing excess weight, I was just maintaining.  Tim`s book gave me the power to feel good about myself again.  It is extremely motivating and has an entirely new view on how to lose body fat.  I liked that he doesn`t bend to conventional `wisdom`, and instead searches out his own answers concerning supplements, foods to eat and weighs to measure body fat.  This book will change your life as long as you are open to new, marvelous, thought provoking ideas.
B002ZG981E|4.0|If you thought parts II and III of \\"Back to the Future\\" were hard to follow (I didn't), wait until you try to wrap your mind around \\"Inception\\". It's an extremely entertaining film, if only because it keeps your brain on the edge of its seat (so to speak), but it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny.<br /><br />The principal difficulty is that, in wanting to make a film about dream states, and moving from his initial horror-film approach to one of straight drama, Christopher Nolan painted himself into a corner. The central dramatic conflict is between Cobb and his guilty memories of his dead wife, whom he accidentally influenced to commit suicide by convincing her of the unreality of their shared experience during an extended dream sequence they were trapped in. When she's finally convinced and \\"commits suicide\\" (along with Cobb) so they can exit, she's become /so/ thoroughly convinced of the \\"unreality\\" of everything, that she later kills herself in the real world.<br /><br />This points to the film's major problem -- Nolan has to /arbitrarily/ define those dream-state conditions and actions needed to make the story unfold as he wishes. The /drama/ is legitimate, but the mechanisms that ultimately incite it are tautologies, not extrapolations from what's known about dreaming -- and therefore unconvincing. (The script sometimes resembles Rick Berman dialog.)<br /><br />The worst of these problems involves lucid dreaming. Lucid dreamers (I'm one), can control most of their dreams. If someone shoots a gun, the bullet is unlikely to cause pain or damage. Yet Saito -- who knows he's in a dream -- is shot and bleeds. Similarly, the laws of physics cannot apply to someone during a lucid dream. We see the characters changing their environments simply by thinking about it -- but they don't walk through walls, teleport, or leap tall buildings in a single bound. If one impossible thing is possible (such as \\"mentally materializing\\" a potent weapon, when needed), then /every/ impossible thing should be possible. There can't be exceptions.<br /><br />I'm reminded of Gene Roddenberry reminding \\"Star Trek\\" writers that \\"Marshall Dillon doesn't stop to explain how a gun works.\\" Christopher Nolan makes a heroic effort to minimize explanations, but \\"Inception\\" suffers from having to have almost everything explained to the viewer. The result is that much of \\"Inception\\" looks like a concoction.<br /><br />If you're wondering why the young woman is named Ariadne -- look it up. And the \\"totem\\" that Cobb carries is a \\"teetotum\\". Versions with numbers around the edge were used in games during the 19th century (possibly earlier).<br /><br />Still, \\"Inception\\" is entertaining (though I wouldn't call it \\"fun\\"), and you're likely to watch it at least twice, if only to try to figure out the things that didn't make sense the first time around. Some of the special effects are mind-boggling. The supplemental material on a second disk is good, but doesn't give an extremely detailed description of the film's -- uh -- inception and development.possible. There can't be exceptions.

0739308742|1.0|OK, I am not writing a book for a review.  This will be quick and pain free.  This book is a NECESSITY, at least I hope it is, to lead into A Dance With Dragons.  This fourth book of supposedly seven of the Song of Ice and Fire series, is flat out lame.  I felt like I had to read this just to keep up with what may happen in the next book.  I honestly wish I did not.<br /><br />George looses track of all of your favorite characters, opting to spend the majority of his time telling us about Cersai Lannister and way too much dumb drama around the Greyjoys.  We did get to hear all bout Brienne and that was about as interesting as watching paint dry.<br /><br />Seriously, he dropped all of the major characters, and led you through a dull drum story about lesser characters and it truly wasn't even told that well.<br /><br />Maybe HBO's new series based on the Game of Thrones book will inspire George to make up for this pathetic attempt to keep us in suspense.<br /><br />I have not felt this defeated since The Phantom Menace.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This CPU is amazing, but be aware of the stock fan/heatsink!!  After only a day of using it I was dealing with headaches...it is extremely loud (sounds like you are in a plane) and additionally often creates a high pitched whine that pierced through my head.  I could not stand it.  After using my computer for a few hours I felt like I had just stepped off a flight across the US.  My old Phenon 1 (2.00 GHz) was silent with the stock fan/heatsinks and I have never had to buy aftermarket heatsinks in the past, but please do yourself and favor and buy an aftermarket heatsink and fan for this product.  If you try the stock, you will only be disappointed and then be required to remove the old fan/heatsink, clean off the thermal paste, buy a new one, and re-install it.  A waste of time - just buy it now :).  I ended up getting the Corsair H50 to replace it.
B001BWTVOM|2.0|This Led Zeppelin In Through The Out Door Japanese SHM (Super High Material) CD does not sound any better than the Led Zeppelin \\"In Throught The Out Door\\" Remaster whether it be the German mini LP replica remaster or the American remaster that comes with the jewel case. I must however state that the Led Zeppelin In Through The Our Door SHM Japanese mini LP replica packaging is great and better than any mini LP replica CD packaging or jewel case version. The outer bag that covers the inner CD cover that was originally released with the LP back in 1979 has been upgraded and made to look like the album cover better compared to the paper baglike cover that comes with the German Mini LP replica version. Also the lyrics that come with these Japanese releases really help and are appreciated considering that it's really tough to figure what Robert Plant is singing on Carouselambra. As far as the HYPE that these SHM CD's sound better than the remasters don't believe it because the only SHM CD's I have found to sound better than the American remasters so far are the YES SHM mini LP replica CD's. Daughtry SHM Jap CD also sounds exactly the same as the American CD release.
B004132HZS|3.0|\\"Sherlock\\" is a BBC mini-series in three episodes. The concept is simple but interesting. What would happen if Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson had lived today, in 21st century London? This modern version of Arthur Conan Doyle's novels was the most popular TV series in Britain last year. Since it ends with a cliff-hanger, I assume new episodes will be produced eventually.<br /><br />Personally, I was somewhat disappointed by the series. The first episode, \\"A study in pink\\" is excellent, but the two remaining episodes didn't live up to my high expectations. I would give \\"A study in pink\\" five stars, and the two other episodes three stars at best. And yes, this seems to be a minority opinion. Everyone else loves the entire series...<br /><br />In \\"Sherlock\\", Dr. Watson is a war veteran from Afghanistan, while Holmes is a real freak. The master detective comes across as a hyperactive, histrionic teenager spouting a Dr. Who hairdo. He has some disturbing sociopathic tendencies as well. Frankly, he's crazier than Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in the classical Granada TV series! Both Holmes and Watson look strangely out of place in 21st century London, giving the series a somewhat unnatural feel. It feels more like science fiction than realism. \\"Sherlock\\" also pokes fun at various Sherlock Holmes stereotypes, as when Holmes (an cocaine addict in the original novels) uses nicotine patches to stimulate his thinking, or when people assume that Dr. Watson and Holmes must be gay, since they share a flat together at Baker Street.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. These are the things I *liked* about the series. My real problem is the plot development...<br /><br />In the first episode (the good one), Holmes and Watson chases a serial killer who makes John Doe from \\"Seven\\" look like an amateur. The episode contains a number of unexpected twists. This is also the episode which introduces the various characters in their modern settings. In the second episode, the suspected criminals are a group of Chinese, who look and act like 18th century Western stereotypes of Chinese. The whole thing feels contrived and frankly ridiculous. But the real let down is the confusing third episode, which introduces Moriarty. The criminal mastermind looks like a parody of Keyser S&ouml;ze or something to that effect. *That's* Moriarty? You gotta be kidding, Miss Hudson!<br /><br />As already mentioned, the whole series ends with a cliff-hanger, but I suppose both Holmes and Watson somehow makes it through, since a new season has been commissioned by the BBC.<br /><br />Since most people like \\"Sherlock\\", chances are you will as well. Personally, however, I was disappointed by the contrast between the excellent pilot and the remaining two episodes.<br /><br />I'll the series as a whole three stars and await further developments...f Chinese, who look and act like 18th century Western stereotypes of Chinese.

B000IJ79UW|5.0|I loved this movie. I still to this day don't understand how a film series that started off with such a great start spiraled into garbage with the 3rd and 4th installments. Made no sense. If this was the only one they had made it still would have been considered a classic. Thats how good it is. As far as I am concerned they only made two films in this series. One and Two. Superman Returns was okay. I hope the new film is cool. I think it will be. I highly recommend this.
B000FC2PKG|3.0|Alone, by Lisa Gardner, (published by Bantam Books, 2005, 480 pages) e-book edition - an interesting plot with many twists that keep the reader constantly at bay as to who is guilty of what.<br /> The story begins with a SWAT sniper taking out a suspect at the moment he appears ready to shoot his wife. It appears that there are many ramifications to the action that was taking place in the high-rise condo and these tend to provide a muddied scenario that entangles the officer in a web of deceit, lies, half-truths and accusations and cross accusations that threaten his very existence as a free man. The situation is complecated by the fact that the officer is carrying a heavy psychological load from occurrences in his youth, which incidentally, place him in the same position as most of the rest of the main characters who similarly have their personal loads.<br />A number of facts in the plot are  inexplicable, or at least questionable. Particularly notable are the subsequent discovery of a second gun in a room that had been cleared of evidence by a police team, some inconsistencies with regard to the officer's ability with a handgun (although superb with a rifle) and the far-reaching  influence of a retired judge and his manipulations. With the news media and reporters' desire to discover and present facts about most public figures, the actions of the judge that had extended over a considerable number of years seem to be a little incredible as are his actions in the present situation. However, the plot moves relentlessly forward at a pace that, for the usual reader, fairly adequately seems to gloss over these discrepancies so that Alone provides an interesting tale to while away a few hours.
B004AKCME8|4.0|I got it dirt cheap and new so on that score I can't complain.<br />I also kept it for my extensive DVD collection (I wouldn't mind seeing it again).<br />Why?<br />Well, the sheer artistry was breathtaking.  The opening sequence had my jaw dropping, this is super-realism at its finest.  I can't find fault with the lavish beauty which was stunning throughout.  An A+++++++ there.<br />However.<br />I can only be mesmerized by shiny objects for just so long before my mind starts to wander.  This wasn't just art on a wall, there was a story involved.  Well, to be honest, neither involving nor evolving.  It's obvious they spent all their money on the wow factor and two bits on the screenplay, if that.<br />The F----- story (I'm being generous here), was a bare bones simplistic play of good against evil.  Like that's never been done before!  And better.  In this case, it's true that familiarity breeds contempt.  Every element has been culled by finer works, there was absolutely nothing fresh or new about the substance.  And this is probably why it was a dismal failure domestically (yet a hit on the international stage - go figure).<br />An exercise in futility?  Maybe.  But I still ended up with a begrudging fondness for the stupid thing.  I'd call it grim but exquisite.<br />Do I recommend it?  I'd say that would depend entirely on your expectations.  I was already forewarned so my expectations weren't high to begin with.  (It's impossible to be disappointed if you don't expect much at the outset.)  That's why I was surprised when I decided to keep it.  It's an emotional response.  It appealed to me on an artistic level and I didn't hate it.<br />I'm still hoping the book was better, if not...well, why make a movie of a crummy book?
B004HU6YZ4|1.0|After considerable listening to Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes here are the reasons I think it's the worst Social Distortion record:  1. There is no Mike Ness grit... at all  2. There is no \\"hard luck\\" feel   3. The lyrics could have been written by a 5th grader... just listen to I'm Still Alive and you will understand i.e. \\"I'm still alive, talkin' that same ol' jive.\\"  The end of the song ends sounding like a bad Guns N' Roses song to boot  4. First there was an organ on Sex, Love, & R n' R, now there's piano and backup female vocals, these just plain suck  5. Far Side of Nowhere sounds like a stupid pop song about nothing that could have been sung by Kelly Clarkson  6. Diamond In The Rough sounds like a song written for Toby Keith with a catchy chorus.  Seriously, \\"what's a punk boy supposed to do\\"... that has to be the single worst lyric that Mike Ness has ever written  7. Road Zombie - Instrumentals are boring, everything about them is boring  8. Can't Take it With You starts out ok, but quickly turns into a pile of crap because of the relentless chorus repeat.  The backup hookers sound like they just got cleaned up at the First Southern Baptist Church and add a layer of devastation to a song I thought was impossible to reach. This is easily the worst song on the record  9. The Hank cover of Alone and Forsaken was better off as a demo that was released in 1996  10. Bakersfield is the only song worth buying on this record. The whole truck stop thing should be saved for a live show, its not needed on a studio album at all.  Trust me though, a quick YouTube search will afford a better, grittier version that doesn't sound like Mike Ness is lying on his bed in tears
1588167461|5.0|Great book.  It's hardback, looks great, has the aged look, and has way more information that I could hope for.  Like the summary says, it's not so much about 'current fashion' but more 'timeless fashion.'    It will cause you to want to buy more things, but that's not what the whole book is about.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|I can write a 20 page review on this poor excuse for a movie; however I already wasted 90+ minutes of my life that I will never get back.  I am a fan of the ORIGINAL KARATE KID and I was very happy when I heard they were remaking this classic. When I heard jaden smith was the karate kid I said, BIG MISTAKE. The movie is poorly written, the acting is non-existing....I could go on but I made my point. I guess jaden smith is the next Tory Spelling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0321704452|5.0|This is my new favorite book on presentation skills! Really great. While some of my other top recommendations (e.g., Presentation Zen; Slide:ology; Resonate) focus more on presentation DESIGN, this wonderful and simple book is all about presentation DELIVERY. It is a terrific (and beautifully created!) resource that I would recommend to anyone who speaks in front of people (i.e., presenters, facilitators, trainers, teachers, etc.) I re-read it cover to cover the night before I had to give a big presentation and it really put my mind at ease, reminded me of the key things I needed to focus on, and set me up for success. It's almost like having a personal presentation skills coach in a book!

B004GP3DTK|5.0|This album from start to finish is fantastic.  There aren't any \\"filler\\" songs to be found.  While the production is slick, there is an edgy and raw vibe to the sound.  Kevin Shirley did a great job of getting these guys to just go after it and nail their performances.  As usual, the musicianship is top notch but I think their songwriting has improved.  I really enjoyed what Kotzen brought as a songwriter to the group, but Paul Gilbert wasn't doing nothing in his solo career.  He wrote some really catchy songs during his hiatus and his excellent songwriting continues to show on this release.  Eric Martin's voice while not my favorite, is nonetheless in top form.  He's got some serious pipes and really did a great job vocally.<br /><br />Recommend picking this album up...worth every penny.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|A very easy album to listen to.  Great backgound music, great driving music, great to just sit and listen to with headphones.    The vocals are great.  The guitar is great.  The bass is great.  The piano is great.  The drums are good/great.  The horns kind of bug me a little, they're just not as tight as the rest of the band.  The production is good/great.  Could be a little more polished, in my opinion.  Just doesn't have the \\"edge\\" or \\"pop\\" of a really well recorded album.  It's good, no doubt, I just wish it was better, considering the quality of the music.    Overall, I've gotta give it 5 stars.  Gregg Allman proves once again why he's been around for so long, and why he's played with so many artists.  The guy is a great musician, period.    I'd definitely put this in the \\"Buy It\\" catagory.
B0048LPRD2|1.0|As another reviewer so succintly stated the opening 2 minutes are a mesmorizing,rollercoster of visual and sonic brain candy. Sadly it's all downhill shortly after that. A relatively strange yet simple plot is led out over roughly 30 minutes. Thereafter the various permutations,digressions and repetition of the theme drag on for what seems like an eternity (2 hours)The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow and the ending is a merciless act that frees the poor viewer to try and collect his or her senses from the oppressive visual pounding that constitutes this film. Fans of Noe's other film's I stand alone and Irreversible will be very disappointed with his latest offering. Must to AVOID.
B0017U7PT6|3.0|I'm not sure if it affects the movie experience, or has anything to do with the low amount of special features, but the disc I got was the Canadian version. I know its not a big deal, but its not the version pictured, and the seller really should have communicated this.

The basic steps for the food prep that are provided with this book are vital for the outcome of good food.

030746363X|5.0|Great book!  I love the self experiments. So much more believable than the tired old 'rules' about calories in calories out, and the aerobic nonsense we've been told over the years. I've never done the high protein before and didn't realize just how en-grained (pardon the pun) white carbs were in my diet. It's been tough to turn down the hot bread or tortilla chips at restaurants, but at least I have hope that this will change something since it's so different!
B002CXLSYU|3.0|I don't even remember what I paid for this but it probably wasn't worth it.  I mean, it's a blu-ray and they can't get decent sound on it?  I should have rented this one first and not bought it.  I don't imagine I will be watching it much.  Sure I like to watch the concert footage and reminisce about Maiden concerts of days past (yikes, many days past at this point, how long has it been since eighth grade, twenty five years?) but I also want great video and great sound.  The video is decent, but the sound is horrible.  Really bad, to the point where on a number of the songs, I can't barely understand what Bruce is saying.  So all in all, disappointing.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Moulin Rouge was already a film with a huge cult following before its appearance on blu ray.  A blu ray transfer of a film when done correctly is an amazing experience and raises a films clarity and quality stratospheres of levels.  But when not done well a film can even look worse than the dvd.  So for a film as lush and dynamic as Moulin Rouge it would seem it was made for blu ray.  So - how does it look and sound?  There are no words to describe how amazing it is.  This film truly was made for blu ray and all its qualities are made that much better.<br />Moulin Rouge may not be for everyone's taste but it is truly an artistic masterpiece made with great ambition.  That cannot be denied.  It is a big, bold and clever extravaganza.  It also miraculously used top 40 tunes from various decades to tell a beautiful, romantic love story and in the process bring the musical back to a place of relevance.  Old and new comes together and visually and musically the film soars from beginning to end.  The cast is superb with major star turns by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Tour de force performasnces by both.<br /><br />Now to the blu ray transfer.  The video is truly a stunning presentation here and shows blu ray to its true best capability.  The colors are so vibrant and seem to jump off the screen.  The black levels, skin tones and overall clarity of picture are just truly amazing.  And then you add in the audio which would either make or break this film.  Well rest easy Moulin Rouge fans for the audio is rich and expansive.  Dialogue is very strong and clear and the music takes a life of its own.  This beautiful audio transfer makes use of all the speakers even when there is no music.  This blu ray presentation honestly will make you feel as if you are inside Moulin Rouge.  With this movie music and its use in a film are also brought to a new level.  The film is magical, creative and a truly romantic fantasy experience.  The blu ray transfer is beautiful and makes this a must have for fans and will definitely bring new admirers to this movie through its magic.  Highly recommended.ave for fans and will definitely bring new admirers to this movie through its magic.  Highly recommended.
0307719774|5.0|I bought this gift for a friend for her birthday and she loved it. It is so cute and it is perfect for someone who wants to get started journaling. There is an interesting question for each day - sometimes thought provoking, sometimes silly. And going back to read what you wrote the previous year is fun. The previous year's entry is right above the new year's entry, so there is no flipping all around or anything like that.     Very fun, very cute and a nice looking journal. It's also pretty small so it'd be easy to take with you while traveling, etc.    Fun!

B004NSULHM|5.0|After my first listen through, it has been out less than 24hrs, I found this album an excellent effort by Radiohead.  Over all it has a much more rhythmic drive than a melodic sound of the previous album.  Vocally Thom Yorke is on top of his game cutting through the electronic rhythmic underlay.  To me, this album reminds me of the sound found in [[ASIN:B000FPYNR6 The Eraser]], his solo album, albeit with more intricate sonic layering.  I will listen to album through several more times in the next week as I would recommend anyone do to appreciate an album, but so far it doesn't surpass the bar set by [[ASIN:B000YXMMAE In Rainbows]], one of my favorite albums of the decade.

I would not advise it for someone who has recently lost a pet, however, because it would make the fresh wounds bleed unnecessarily.

0143038583|5.0|I found this book highly enjoyable and thought provoking. I began to understand what truly organic food is and not all that claims to be Organic in a supermarket like Whole Foods is totally true.<br /><br />You always here why grass fed beef is better for you, tastes better and is usually pricier but this book explains why and it makes sense. For instance, cows, steers, etc evolved to consume and process grass, not corn. However, in our industrial food chain corn is on the menu and the animals get sick and need antibiotics to stay healthy until slaughter.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chapters that detail the acts of hunting and gathering for one's food. It is more rewarding. I greatly enjoy quahogging and knowing I gathered the food myself and it is as fresh and natural as can be.<br /><br />I recommend this book because it will defintely open your eyes and mind to the way you and we as a country eat and view food.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|I've been ripping records to mp3/wav for years using a standard record player wired straight to a sound card or with an iMic adapter. When that player finally died, I found the Ion brand. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars for something I probably won't be using for too many more times, but didn't want a pice of crap either. Did my homework and price checks and brought this one home.     Within 30 minutes of unpacking I was ripping my first record, with great results. I use the Goldwave program to capture and edit the music, so no experience with the included software or Audacity. I'm used to Goldwave's tools so I'll keep using it.     I did detect a small whine when I hooked it up to computer speakers through the turntable's (very short) RCA cables while it was hooked up to the laptop via USB, but haven't dug into it as I use it only to rip tracks.     It has a cue lever, although it is hidden way in the corner (my last player used a cue button on the front), and the record starts spinning when you move the lever over the record. Easy to use, no skipping, looks good on the desk.
0312600844|4.0|This rather involved novel focuses on the lives of the Berglund family, Walter, Patty, and children Joey and Jessica, of St. Paul, Mn, and then Washington DC, as a window into the pressures of modernity. It is not that their particular psychological makeup, family interactions, interests pursued, etc are necessarily representative of middle-class American families, but they are situated in the same turbulent, demanding world: the post 9-11 world of Bush, Cheney, and Iraq rooted in unilateral military domination and the promotion of get-rich-quick schemes, while disparaging social progressivism, including environmentalism. That is the backdrop in which the dissatisfactions and longings of Patty, not without consequences for others, are played out.<br /><br />The Berglund's seem to be an exemplary family living in a gentrified section of St. Paul in the early 2000's. Walter is a lawyer in the conservation movement - even commutes on a bike - and Patty is a neighborhood facilitator, though there is the suspicion among some that all is not right with them. Patty disapproves of her trashy, single-mom neighbor, but confirms neighbors' doubts with her menacing and destructive behavior when her independent-minded, teenage son Joey, who she has coddled forever, betrays her by moving into the neighbor's household to begin a life-long relationship with doe-eyed daughter Connie. It is now that the never fully resolved complications of her college years, involving the high-minded, kindly egg-head Walter, his very close friend, the sexy, edgy fledgling rocker Richard, and the termination of her stellar basketball career with a knee injury, resurface with a vengeance as she is again pulled by the lure of Richard but invariably finds relief in a wine bottle.<br /><br />Walter's life is hardly free of stress. The distancing and depression of Patty are upsetting, but they have moved to Washington for Walter to head an organization, privately funded by a Texas oil man, that has the mission to create a large preserve in WVa for an obscure songbird. However, the reality is that the project permits corporate interests to destroy pristine mountain tops and the eco-system for the easy extraction of coal with a promise to clean up and repair - that is, exploitation of nature now, environmentalism many years later. Walter's principled and impeccably-led life is even more eroded as he turns to his comely assistant Lalitha to ease his troubled life. A rather bizarre, implausible development is that Joey, through his college roommate's family, has become part of a flakey military procurement company, where he makes considerable sums of money selling rusted spare parts to foreign governments.<br /><br />The book is lengthy, but the author with his ever captivating language and insights on life's complications keeps the interest level high as the story shifts among various locales and perspectives. He is hardly reluctant to subtly highlight the ridiculous and absurd - a scene in which Joey searches in a toilet with a fork for lost jewelry comes to mind. The principal characters are not necessarily easy to understand as the Walter, Patty, Richard triangle goes through many iterations, with new complications at each stop. In any number of scenarios, Walter seems to be almost willfully clueless, while Patty is often in some sort of retreat due to her self-admitted \\"mistakes\\" and demons haunting her from her formative years. They all actually love each other, but they seem to not clearly grasp just how and what that implies. Even Patty's marriage to Walter was a rather uncertain act. Sexual tensions are always present, especially with Richard and Patty, but more ache is achieved than fulfillment.<br /><br />Freedom, as evidenced in this book, is a complex matter. Obviously, there are constraints and limitations imposed from birth, but more general is the fact that all actions have consequences. Simplistic freedom, as loudly espoused in most propaganda pieces, is mostly a chimera - free sex and free markets heading the list of fantasy freedoms. Yet a failure to act has its own complications. The judicious or irresponsible exercise of choices is one of the most compelling aspects of the book. It is suggested that after much fumbling, even pain, people can eventually come around to making life-enhancing choices.nd free markets heading the list of fantasy freedoms.

0307454541|4.0|The world can do without another review of Dragon Tattoo, so I'll just comment on the obsession throughout the book of the characters making, drinking and thinking about coffee--which they could only do when there was a break from all the sandwiches!  See for yourself. Search in the Kindle edition for \\"coffee\\" and you get hundreds of hits.  Same goes for sandwiches.  But when you're an ace investigative reporter or a computer-hacking bad ass with tattoos, coffee and sandwiches must be the best fuel.

6303407188|4.0|Wood's Legacy, Sort Of.<br /><br />I saw the mid-90s biopic, Ed Wood and have always wanted to watch it!  Wood's films are at once amateurish if not just downright bad.  Yet if you were going to watch one, prepare for some charm and some silliness along the way -- bad dialogue, falling down cardboard tombstones, etc.<br /><br />I really wish though that the director Tim Burton was less fast & loose on his facts.  Loretta King was not allergic to water.  Wood's wife was not self-absorbed and cranky.  Bela Lugosi's son has stated that his father was not using vulgarities, especially in front of women (per a Wiki article someplace -- take or leave!), and Ed Wood never actually met Orson Welles!<br /><br />However, Burton has said that the book he was basing the film on was not totally accurate as well.  I think this does not justify being sloppy.  Still, Johnny Depp adds depth to his portrayal of the maligned director, his tendency to dress up in women's clothes and his close friendship with Bela Lugosi, whose last performance was in a Wood film.<br /><br />Despite the silliness of the film and its doubtful accuracy, I liked several things about it.  The portrayal by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi was great.  I've seen many of Lugosi's films and Martin really had the accent down and where they played Lugosi to be small and weak during his drug rehab, the disturbing scenes where Lugosi is shooting up and the foul-mouthed yet lovable washed up actor doing his thing, Martin had down so well as to win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar!<br /><br />The actual production of the production of Plan 9 from Outer Space was great.  The actors who portrayed the Vampira and Tor Johnson were spot on.  Bill Murray was his usual foppish self as he portrayed a gay man who wanted, but never got, a sex change but played the supreme mind of the galaxy just fine, thank you.  Sarah Jessica Parker plays the forgettable girlfriend of Wood.<br /><br />DVD:<br /><br />The best part of the DVD for me was the Making of Lugosi, with an interview with Martin Landau and how he prepared and got into character.  Rick Baker also was interviewed and gushed how he always wanted to do make-up on a movie like this and actually would have done it for free.  He won an Oscar too.  The deleted scenes could stay deleted!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />It's really too bad that Burton was not completely accurate with his facts regarding Lugosi and Wood.  But if he wanted to portray a strong friendship and both actors going for their dreams, then he achieved a nice piece of cinema.  Recommended.<br /><br />Cast<br />Johnny Depp<br />Edward D.

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|This adapter sounds like it is expensive when compared to some of the alternatives but it is well worth it. It is able to port the audio to HDTVs, something that I  don't think any other one can do currently. For that aspect alone it is worth it. It passes on crystal clear picture and audio. The only draw back that I have found is that the combination of my TV/Computer will not pass on a 1080p signal. I am not sure where the problem lies. The description and my computer both say this adapter support it and my TV allows 1080p for other devices I have but whenever I change the setting to 1080p, it gives me a black screen. I can use 1080i, however, so it is not a big deal. Most people would not even know the difference between the two.

In our study of history, we all know of the debauched king, rotting away in his castle.  But we are sadly bereft of a picture of this vibrant, intelligent ruler who wrote, created, and defied the major power of the day.  The acting is superb.  The costuming is wonderful.  The play of politics, well, that is something to be required of all history classes.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I am not a horror-film fan.<br /><br />The Jasons and the Freddys and the forgotten-half-brother-of-the-high-school-jock who grows up to kill the children of his tormentors at summer camp, don't do it for me either.<br /><br />There are a few, though, that are really well done and speak more about phobias that plague each of us and how we adapt or are marginalized by them. Films like The Exorcist, Carrie, The Amityville Horror and even Fright Night whose dark expose offers up the spiritual in a backhanded way whereas the viewer is made to understand the esoteric mechanics of life.<br /><br />The great works of Art do. This is their purpose.<br /><br />When Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, nearly a century and a half ago, the issue she (and her mother and step-father for that matter) wrestled with was the idea of how to re-construct the human being to get him/ her to see beyond the psychology that defines gender and nature. The Hollywood bastardization of this great novel with its grotesque redepiction of the Creation undermined the motivation of the author and, by default, the message.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (2008) is director Tomas Alfredson's visionary adaptation of author John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel of the same name.<br /><br />In this film, the Swedish version (and the far, far superior version to the US release) we meet Oskar (brilliantly played by Kare Hedebrandt) a twelve-year old or as he'd say to Eli, \\"twelve years, eight months and nine days!\\"<br /><br />Oskar is the stereotypical outcast. He's fearful of going to school. Fearful of what the school day will bring in the form of the school's bullies, who relentless taunt him because he doesn't \\"fit in.\\"<br /><br />Does Oskar really not \\"fit in?\\" I suggest that it would be a gross misunderstanding to characterize his isolation by a few as being someone who doesn't \\"fit in.\\" Of course, he fits in. He was a normal teenager. He loved swimming, loved his Rubic's Cube and admired the girls who wouldn't give him (or many of us, at that age) the time of day, preferring the company of those who made his life (and ours) a living hell.<br /><br />Oskar lets out steam in a time and place where he feels completely free to express himself: outside in the cold, dark evenings of the deserted playground directly under the watchful eye of his loving, single-mother. He fancies taking out his aggressions not on society at-large, not on any innocent classmates, but on the bullies themselves. And, that's an important distinction to make.<br /><br />It was during one of these moments, coincidentally, where he meets Eli (played equally brilliant by Lena Leandersson) a mysterious girl who looks to be about the same age as Oskar. And, in fact, just before he tells her how old he is, she tells him that she is \\"twelve... more or less.\\"<br /><br />\\"More or less?\\" What does that mean, \\"more or less?\\" Oskar's inquiry leads him no where. Who is this girl? Why doesn't she know how old she is? Why is she dressed like this? And, why is she out here in the cold, barefooted in nothing but a nightdress? He has so many questions but they seem to elude his naturally inquisitive mind when he stopped to look at her friendly face.<br /><br />This movie, unlike its predecessors, has only a few moments of violence (considering the subject). That is to say, you'll not be shocked by excessive gore. She is a vampire, of course, and as such she is driven by solely survival propensities and nothing more.<br /><br />The film, to its director's credit, doesn't rely on the creature's physiological pursuit. This is a relationship film, plain and simple. And, we relate because we understand. We see ourselves in the many faces that play different characters.<br /><br />At the heart of this film is an intimate discussion about friendship, loyalty, about confronting fear and daring to ask the unspeakable questions to and about ourselves and the people we have relationships with.<br /><br />This is the genius of this film. This is a work of art.<br /><br />Right now, we're facing cut backs in art programs in schools all around the US. The prevailing notion is that the arts are an unnecessary expenditure. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, the film (and I venture to say the book, as well) is an argument against that notion. There are but a few who're profiting financially from this film and book, but to reduce the value of what we experience in terms of dollars and cents is to miss the whole point.<br /><br />What can be gained? How about the same conversation that Shelley had? How about re-imagining ourselves, not as a grotesque Hollywood reinvention, but as an amalgam of ideas, dreams, lessons, as thinking, rational, compassionate human beings who share the wealth of our experiences with our fellow man for no other motivation than to see and to be a part of a more prosperous community.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.revailing notion is that the arts are an unnecessary expenditure.

I liked this last one the best, precisely for the same reasons at least one of the other reviewers did not.  It wasn't formulaic.  It wasn't predictable.  Katniss, the main character, was oh so real and her and her supporting characters reactions and fates were honest. The book was a creative and moving page turner and the story is going to stick with me.  I am sad I have no more of them left to read!

Oh yeah this is a Floyd song alright. That song was \\"Free Four\\". I had never heard this song before nor did I ever hear of the album \\"Obscured By Clouds\\". Curious, I bought the cd and was quite impressed. Especially since I learned that they took around two weeks to write and record the album. Wow! This album is a revelation. I had only been familiar with their later material (\\"Dark Side...\\" and beyond)so I really enjoyed listening to their earlier material. This is a lovely album. Gorgeous guitar work from Gilmour. The songs are deep(but hey that's classic Floyd).

B000002U9W|5.0|According to some of the reviews I read, this album is definitely for die hard fans. Well I guess I've become one. I had always been aware of their later stuff (\\"Dark Side...\\" and beyond), but only recently have I become more interested in their early stuff. For instance, up to now I was not aware that they were the premiere psychadelic band in England nor were they considered an \\"underground\\"(or what we call \\"alternative\\")band. I knew a little about their early history but not much. Lately, I've been reading a biography of the band and came across this album title. Curious, I bought the cd and gave it a listen. The title track is amazing! Man I have always loved \\"extended\\" versions of songs, so this was up my alley. I love how it begins then goes off on some tangent. Then returns to the main melody. It is truly a trip. That's what I love about their music. It takes you on a long wonderous journey.
B000002HFU|4.0|Ol' Dirty Bastard (ODB) was a character with an interesting personality. His drunken and high lyrics were completely entertaining for any listener (its obvious that he was under the influence while recording some songs on here). In 1995, was his major label debut on WEA, one of the many releases that the Wu Tang Clan were pushing out since their 1993 classic [[ASIN:B000002WPI Enter Wu-Tang]]. Reurn To The 36 Chambers has what many early Wu albums have; raw beats mostly done by RZA, and hardcore lyrics that can blow your mind at times. His voice was so distinctive (sometimes inaudible), that any song you can easily recognize him on any song that he appeared on.<br /><br />Tracks that stood are are easy to pick out, and there are quite a few on here. The two classic singles here \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\\" and \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\" are instant headbangers, especially the latter song. ODB keeps his drunken technique style on songs like \\"Hippa To Da Hoppa\\" and the sing along \\"Drunk Game (Sweet Sugar Pie)\\". Even when ODB does give out a few tunes, you will be entertained on the way that the song is made. Aside from all that, ODB shows that one has to have skills to be a member of such an elite group. On \\"Damage\\" he trades verses back and forth with The GZA. Rhyming with Ghostface Killah on the sequel to \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\" and other songs with various Wu members on the second half of the album shows that ODB can come hard and can be taken seriously. I like \\"Cuttin' Headz\\" with the RZA, which is an old Wu song dated back in '91/'92.<br /><br />The overall product is great. Its evident that every Wu and golden age rap owns this album. The album itself is fun and entertaining with ODB at his best showing his personality behind the microphone. This and his sophomore album [[ASIN:B00000K3GK N**** Please]] are his only two notable releases before his passing in late '04. Highly recommended to anyone who doesn't own this album.

0553381687|5.0|[There is a thorough review for ASOIAF here on amazon which outlines many significant points, but I thought I'd put out a review in my own words, simply because I care so much about this series.]<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin consists of:<br />1. A Game of Thrones (to be aired as the HBO series Game of Thrones on April 17, 2011)<br />2. A Clash of Kings<br />3. A Storm of Swords<br />4. A Feast for Crows<br />5. A Dance with Dragons (via Martin's \\"Not a Blog\\" LiveJournal, he has 3 POV chapters left to finish at the time of this writing.)<br />6. The Winds of Winter (forthcoming)<br />7. A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)<br /><br />What's all the fuss?<br /><br />This series is the progenitor of a new wave of literature which combines elements of epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and intellectual literary fiction.  The idea was to create a true world (in all its color, grit, mystery, politics, realism and so on) through cultured prose, and yet still have all the elements of escapist fantasy; the idea was to create real people with real drama, and insert them into a fantastic reality; the idea was to reinvent the fantasy genre from clich&eacute; hack-and-slash/sword-and-sorcery to something original, passionate, and enthralling.<br /><br />Martin succeeded in these goals, and inspired others to follow in a similar vein: The Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Prince of Nothing, The Gentleman Bastard, The First Law, etc.<br /><br />Why so good?<br /><br />1. Exceptional writing:  Martin is a literary master.  His prose doesn't just \\"work,\\" it really inspires.  His vocabulary is learned yet approachable.  The text inserts me directly into this medieval kingdom.  Imagery runs rampant with details galore.  Just a very well written story.<br /><br />2. Believable characters: Grey characters!  Real, believable characters with unique dialogue, motivations, and reactions populate this entire series.  Martin develops interesting personalities with his talent for voice.  These characters come alive within just a few pages of reading their chapters.  People change!  What a concept!<br /><br />3. Risk:  This is a world of blades and steel, arrows and leather.  People die in war.  This is a story of politics, intrigue, and betrayal.  People are assassinated.  Main characters may serve as a central window into the chief plotline, but that certainly doesn't mean that they are safe from harm.  Pain and death MEAN something, and Martin loves to make us feel.<br /><br />4. History:  Martin has spent years living in this world, and the history is so rich that the immersion is instant.  It's almost disorienting.  The details that he has planned out and the meticulousness of the layers within the story are so natural that you cannot help but be in awe.<br /><br />5. Tactful use of fantasy elements:  No \\"magic missile\\" spells or \\"jelly-legs\\" jinxes here.  There are strong fantasy elements, but they are used in tactful, and oftentimes subtle, ways.  The supernatural is seen as superstition by most of the characters in the story, and so when something akin to \\"magic\\" does show up, it is unique and potent.<br /><br />6. Details matter:  Watch the description of a character, even if you don't know the character's name; they'll show up later.  Actually think about what people say; you may be able to find out the answer to a question far before the characters do.  Dreams and prophecies may be vague, but they are actually vital!  Martin has also acknowledged his use of the unreliable narrator (in fact, he has to use it, in order to make the POV chapters believable); find the inconsistencies between what happens and what characters think, and see the story from a different perspective!<br /><br />7. Engaging plot:  All three main plotlines are exotic and entertaining: the fight for power over Westeros' throne, the exile of the last Targaryen queen, and the threat of the Others in the north.  Filled with cliffhangerschapter after chapter, mysteries that need solving, epic moments of badassery, horrible moments of dread, cool one-liners and philosophical quotes, raunchy sex, and violent death, the story is brimming with awesome.<br /><br />Why doesn't everyone like this series, then?<br /><br />Virtually every one- or two-star review I have seen (amazon, goodreads, etc.) can be boiled down to one of three categories:<br />1. \\"The Fantasy Lover\\" (a.k.a. \\"Sex is Nasty\\" Syndrome)<br />a. \\"Ew, it's so gross and disgusting and tragic and there's so much sex and violence and swearing!  Where is my damsel being rescued by the handsome, heroic prince?  Why do people die?  I felt like `washing in industrial cleanser' to get this filth away from me!  Fantasy should only be about romantic ideals and have nothing to do with reality... and the good guys should always win!\\"<br />b. To you, I say, stop being such a prude.  The writing is excellent and appropriate to its content, and the idea is to explore the connection between fantasy and reality.  Fantasy does not have an \\"end purpose\\" in mind, and you are simply being obstinate about originality and progress.  People are not black and white and neither is life; people die, and people are maimed, and people have sex, and people go to the bathroom, and people are raped, and sometimes, the `bad guys' win; however, I think escapist fantasy may be even MORE engaging when combined with those aspects of reality... and that is an opinion enjoyed by millions of people.<br /><br />2. \\"The Whiner\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Author is My Bitch\\" Syndrome)<br />a. \\"It's been five years since the last book, and Martin is fat and old, and he has his fingers in so many pies, and he doesn't care about the series anymore, and he's just trying to milk it, and why can't he finish it already, and I could have the next book written by now, and and and and and....\\"<br />b. To you, I say, no, the author is not your slave.  Your buying his books did not indenture him into servitude, nor did it oblige a contract. He writes when he writes, and you read when he's done.  Complaining about it [timing, his other projects, etc.] makes you look pathetic, silly, and a tad bit unstable. It's like trying to intimidate a world-renowned TV chef to finish his/her magnum opus because you just want lunch on your TV tray, damnit!  How full of yourself do you have to be?<br />c. Also, the books do not deserve a one star rating simply because they aren't coming out as fast as you want.<br /><br />3. \\"The Pragmatist\\" (a.k.a. \\"But Reading Takes So Much Time!\\" Syndrome)<br />a. \\"The first book is 800 pages, and they just get longer from there; there's no end in sight for the series and no single book tells a full story; there's too much exposition with too much `backstory'; the plot is so slow!\\"<br />b. To you, I say... well, this might actually be a valid concern for some people.  The story IS huge... but in case you didn't see the genre description, it is EPIC fantasy, and Martin has himself described it as having a \\"cast of thousands.\\"  The advantages of longer books are that characters can develop into fully fleshed out beings and that a fictional world can become, in some part, real.  It's also a huge story in terms of scope - the synopsis states it simply enough: \\"...where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime....\\"<br /><br />Minor Spoilers on Individual Books:<br /><br />A Game of Thrones<br />A brilliant first book, this begins each of the three main plots.  For the first plot, the main house we deal with here is the Starks, the house \\"in charge\\" of the North.  For the second plot, we are introduced to the naivet&eacute; of Daenerys (Duh-NAIR-iss) and for the third, we get to see the shabby condition of the Night's Watch.  Though each plot develops independently, it is easy to see how they interconnect.  The characters really drive this piece, and it is a true trip for anyone, new or old, to the genre.

B0038VPB5W|2.0|This cd is one of the worst pieces of trash I've heard in a long time. People call this band metal? Their old cds are better than this corporate piece of trash. Save your money or buy one of their older albums!
B002ZG97E2|5.0|You don't need children around to justify watching this movie. I'm 50-something and laughed and laughed through the entire thing. The little girls and minions are adorable and funny, but so are the so-called villians.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! I rented this at first to make sure I liked it, but now I'm buying the DVD pack and will buy more if they are produced, which I'm so hoping.
1400049628|4.0|This book was in good condition the spine wasn't bent and the pages were not torn I enjoyed the book a-lot worth purchasing
B0034G4P7G|1.0|This movie could not keep my interest. I got a good nap while watching it though. The rest of my family had the same reaction. I'm not sure why this movie receives so much praise.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I just received this album for my Valentine's Day present.  It is great!  I love the banjo!  Little Lion Man and The Cave are my two favorite songs right now but I like the entire album.  I can't wait to see them live at Wakarusa.  The songs seem to be a bit slower and toned down except for the two songs that are currently my favorite.  I think that they will really bring it live though.  The singer sounds similar to Dave Matthews and that isn't a problem for me because I love Dave Matthews.    Overall, Great Album!
0743277708|5.0|Like many classic tales, Watership Down can be enjoyed as a straightforward adventure novel.  Others might point out its (political) allegorical aspects, in the same way that the Narnia Chronicles incorporate (Christian) allegory into their adventure stories.  Of course, this does not make a novel good or bad, or enjoyable to read.  The key point is this: Watership Down is a fun, action-packed, and thoughtful novel that has maintained its status over its 30 years in continual printing.    The story follows the lives of several rabbits, as they first flee the destruction of their home warren (at the hands of human developers), and then establish a new home in the more remote location of Watership Down.  Obviously, as rabbits, they are subject to predation by foxes, stoats, and men, and those crossing the open fields have nowhere to run when danger strikes.  Adventure inevitably follows, and the personalities of the group are combined and used to best advantage by Hazel, the \\"decider\\" and eventual leader of the group.  Besides Hazel we have Bigwig the policeman/action hero; Pipkin the loyal sidekick, Blueberry the thinker, Fiver the sensitive one, Holly the tracker, Dandelion the storyteller, etc.  If these appear to be crudely drawn carricatures, well, rabbits are simple animals with simple tastes.  They want shelter, community, and to create little rabbits.  The last drives most of the action in the book, as the original Watership warren was founded entirely by males.  Interspersed throughout are stories from rabbit lore, telling the story of the creation of rabbits and the deeds of derring-do performed by El-ahrairah, the cunning first king of the rabbits.    The freedom and equality (indeed, even democracy) that the Watership rabbits enjoy is contrasted with the three other warrens in the book.  The original warren run in a classic strongman meritocracy style (the bigger the rabbit, the higher up the chain of command).  On their way to Watership they encounter a libertarian warren where the rabbits apparently come and go as they please, free of laws or authoritarian figures, but their freedom is paid for with a terrible price.  Thirdly is Efafra, a military dictatorship set up to preserve secrecy (from discovery by men) at the cost of all personal freedom.  Thus, the main theme (at least, to a post-9/11 North American reader) would appear to be the balance of security and freedom, with our heroes finding a good balance (but leaning far to the freedom side), while the Efafrans clamp down on all freedom in the interest of mutual security.  Perhaps this was Adams's point - the IRA was certainly active (and committing terrorist acts on British soil) at the time he was writing this book, and other European terrorist organizations were also starting up around this time (Red Brigades in Italy, Baader-Meinhof Gang in Germany, etc.).  Therefore, the book is likely to continue to resonate with any society struggling with the classic balance between security and freedom.    These musings are not meant to suggest that Adams spends most of his time on philosophy or in-depth arguments.  No, this book is successful because it taps into basic human instincts and folklore, and presents it in a fun, fresh and exciting way.  Just because the main characters are rabbits, it doesn't mean that they aren't \\"people\\".
1934356476|3.0|If you want to learn in detail how Metaprogramming Ruby works, by all means: buy this book, it is very useful!  The content of the book is excellent! The techniques described are very useful, and the author uses mostly good examples to illustrate the use of the different recipes. As a side-note, I also recommend the screencast series by PragProg.com about Metaprogramming Ruby. The book has three chapters which cover how Metaprogramming is used in the Rails framework, which is also very useful.  So far, so good, BUT......  The downside of this book is the writing style -- I'm quoting from orangekay's review here on Amazon:    [...] it's written in a really annoying tone that attempts to present said information as a story.     That story is very boring, gets old after the first paragraph, and makes it very difficult to find     the code you want amidst the sea of useless prose.  I can only second that statement!  It is extremely annoying to read this book because of the stupid side-story, and it is very hard to find the relevant concepts later. The names of the concepts/recipes discussed in the book are mostly badly chosen, which is both annoying and confusing later.  I'm wondering why this style was chosen.. to add pages?  It's so annoying that I feel tempted to take a big fat black marker and x-out all this junk from the silly side-story.  If I had this in an editable electronic form, I would re-format the content!  I wish the author would take these comments to heart, and in the next version of the book, would follow a standard format, e.g. a \\"Cook-Book\\" approach, to discuss the techniques described in this book -- without a side-story!  If you want to learn in detail how Metaprogramming Ruby works, by all means: buy this book, it is very useful!     I would give this book 4 stars, but because of the obnoxious writing style I rate it as 3 stars.
B001R4CKGU|4.0|I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. First, a small confession - I'm an aspiring writer. So, as a writer, I enjoyed the poetry of Harding's prose. As a reader, I can see how some people are less than enamored with the book. It's quite literary, where the writing itself is the star, more so than any plot or character. I enjoyed it because of the interesting phrasing. I thought some of the sentences were stunning. Sometimes it was difficult to understand what was going on because of the flowery language, but I still think it's worth reading.
055358894X|5.0|This book was really, really enjoyable. I'm not going to say it was a life-changing meditation on power or revenge, or a remarkably deep and touching piece - so if that's what you're looking for, head elsewhere.   But I will say that it's a technical tour-de-force, and Lynch's talent made this book so much FUN to read. I haven't gotten through a book this effortlessly or happily in a long time. The characters, the corkscrew plot, the well-built world and the original-yet-somehow-familiar setting...It never truly dragged, despite its length, and I flew through it eagerly.   Just read it!
0345404475|5.0|PKDick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?is a marvellously pitched book bringing up concerns of a future Earth full of radioactive dust and its diminishing life forms.Lots of animal species are extinct.Humans enhance their status and humanity by owning one of the remaining life forms-goat,sheep,horse-or its machine form (but keeping this a secret from the neighbours).Rick Deckard owns an electric sheep and covets his neighbour's horse. The novel seems at times low-key,but it represents a fight for survival,between the few remaining humans and `specials'(retards) and the 6 outlaw androids,who like fallen angels from distant duties of servility on alien planets,have rebelled and illegally come back to earth,to live longer lives(they are retired in 2 years)to be come more human,to become indistinguishable from the humans.Younger,fitter humans have already emigrated to alien worlds,to escape a dying Earth in 2021.An Earth of laser guns,hover cars,empathy boxes and religious TV gurus like Mercer.The religious themes and philosophy are totally lost in the film,as it beefs up the action.     Rick is called back out of retirement as a bounty hunter to `retire' the 6 remaining Nexus-6 androids.He can earn $1000 for every android he kills.The way he can do this is by applying the VF empathy test.Androids lack humanity, androids are ruthless killers,although their disguises can hoodwink the bounty hunters.One of his colleagues while doing the test is blasted by an android.They are too clever,quick and getting to be more able than their human models.Will they take over?One is an Opera singer who sings beautifully.Rick appreciates her `talent'and he goes to give her the empathy test,but she calls police to help her get rid of him asking creepy questions.He is taken in for questioning by the policeman to his headquarters,only to find this parallel police-force is run by androids who use an unknowing human police man, who helps kill three of the androids with Rick.Rick gets paid and purchases a live goat for his roof.Things are looking up.Killing is tough on Rick.He needs to give his depressive wife hope.     Rick also manages to get into a relationship with an android,Rachel,who helps save his life.She's an android prototype who other female androids are based on.She seems unaware she is android and he tests her to prove it,but he sympathises and he doesn't kill her.Rachel has been programmed with false childhood memories she never had.Rick has a wife at home whom he cares about,who almost feels sorry for `andys' but knows Rick's job is to retire them to better himself.Rick is called out on the same day he's killed 3,to finish off the remaining 3,who are holed up in some empty apartment block somewhere on the margins.Rick is drained by the effort as his empathy can be used against him by a Rachel-look-a-like android.The 3 remaining androids are with a `special' J.R.Isidore in his apartment.There is an awful scene where Pris cuts the legs off a spider to see if it can still walk.This troubles J.R. so much he betrays their presence to Rick,not their exact location.The killings are having an adverse effect on Rick and Rachel has killed his goat.He's at the end of his tether...SF of a high order.
1594202842|4.0|I thought this was a great read.  It's worth noting that you can enjoy the book and disagree with her parenting style.  Chua has stated that this is not a how-to book about parenting, more so a journal of her parenting experience.  She brought up some very good points and was honest about her experiences, even when it did not show her in the best light.  Also, she has a very intelligent and dry wit - many are not going to get this and will take much of the content the wrong way - which is unfortunate because there are quite a few funny parts in the book.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I have been impressed with The XLR inputs and external mics.  The XLR have very low noise and the external mics pict up clear crisp sound.
B0039Q7QKE|2.0|This is probably my first low rating review. I ordered three of these under the \\"special offer\\"...one for myself, one for my brother in law who is also a Trekkie and the other for a cousin.     The items were received in their original packaging but the first one I opened, the Star Fleet Command which was for myself, had no clasps for the pins at the back....checked in the box, nothing. And funny enough, the clasps were included with the other two!     Needless to say that these clasps do not seem to be the regular type and who knows where I'm gonna find them.    Quality assurance needs to be improved on this product!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|The X-Grip was good but is a hard to dis- attach a monopod from the bottom due to lack of room.  Whith a light attached to the light bracket it seemed to wobble a bit and shake to camera ever so slightly while going so.  I will have to review the fooatage to see if it was noticeable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love Catching Fire.The Hunger Games was,of course,marvelous,but except for Katniss' stories we learned very little about day to day life in Panem. Okay,she reminices in the nararation a lot,but it's still not the same. I love that in Catchin Fire a lot of it takes place in District 12. ~brought to you by Mistystar123~
1934030597|5.0|Simply a great book.  It covers all the topics, major and minor - even manufacturer specific differences updated for the current season.  everything you need to know from a complete teardown to after ride maintenance is here.  The author goes through all the procedures step by step with technical illustrations along the way.  I very much prefer the illustrations to pictures because they are clearer and easier to understand.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|&#60;Warning:Possible spoilers&#62;i lovethe Hunger Games. How does Suzanne Collins do it?she has made a &#34;post apocalypse future&#34;story, and yet it seemsso simialr to our world today,only grotesquely altered.The Hunger Games provides endless opportunity for fanfiction,roleplay and just imagining. Katniss Everdeen is a true heroine,and the supporrting charachters are marvelous. The Hunger Games is full of action and adventure,yet there is a deep emotional undercurrent. all things considered,the hunger games is delightful book.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|So, I was a fan of M. Night but his last few movies had missed the mark with me.  He was the absolute worst choice to direct Avatar: TLAB since his strength is not action oriented stories, but rather suspense thrillers.      With the Devil, you get an incredible story that matches up well with the M.Night's directorial talents.      Overall, the story and plot are flawless.  He plants a seed in scene one, it grows in scene two, and is ready for a brillaint harvest in scene three.  What I mean is that all the story elements, plots, characters, motivations, etc. etc. are all seamlessly woven together to produce a masterpiece.    Its hard for a movie to be perfect, to run on all cylinders, to be a flawless gem.      Well boys and girls, I'm here to say that this is such a movie.  It could not be a better film, it really couldn't.  Great setup, nice rising action, brilliant climax    This is a must see movie, so glad I got it!!!
0385338082|5.0|I joined a book club 6 months ago...mainly to hang out with friends, eat, and drink wine.  I finally finished one of our books last month.  It was ok.  This is our book this month.  I LOVED it, finished it early, and couldn't wait to read more and more of it.  So entertaining, fun, funny, sweet, you can't not like Emma :)  This is officially my fave book, and I want to read all of the other Sophie Kinsella books now!

B004DK5CW4|1.0|The DVD of Secretariat I received from Amazon was defective.  It was difficult to start and three quarters thru the pixels  started to appear on the screen and finally the screen froze.  If this technology is not reliable, it is not convenient for me to  buy this type of product online.
B000FA57US|5.0|This is the movie in the series that people hate the most, mostly critics and fans of the series. Sure, it does have its noticeable flaws and cringe worthy moments. The film suffers from a rough script and was rushed into production before the script could be perfected, it was released into theaters only a year after part 4 came out. While I can understand this argument, I would argue that almost all of the Friday The 13th films were rushed into production and were also released a year after their predessors and were far worse then what this movie did. Most people point out this movie's faceless characters but again, I would argue that Friday The 13th has done a lot worse when it comes to character development and yet, these films are not bashed for the same reason.<br /><br />While this isn't a great movie and no where close to the original John Carpenter film, I still feel that it includes some of the most epic scenes in the entire series, more so then the highly praised Halloween 4. The final 30 mintues are thrilling and the ending leaves you wanting more because you're not sure what's going to happen next. I also think that this film added new story elements that were interesting. This film is also much darker and even gothic I think. Still, everyone is welcome to their opinion but I'm just sharing my voice.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Fantastic all around.  If you are looking to get BSG on Blu-ray this is the version to get.  Each season is in its own container with episode lists and short description on the back.  Box is very nice as well.  The picture is amazing on my HDTV, only regret is that I don't have a better sound system.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Truly the best and funniest 12 half hours ever presented on anything,anywhere by the best. Each episode is so filled with bitting humour and silliness that I can watch them over and over. I think \\"Basil the rat\\" is the  funniest thing I have ever seen. When everyone is looking for Manual's pet \\"Siberian Hamster\\" lost in the hotel dining room.. it has to be the crowing touch of any episode. and of course when Basil discovers the guest not eating his breakfast in bed in \\"The Kipper and the Corpse\\" there's another one snuffed it in the night. I cannot even describe the insanity of \\"The Germans\\" but to say I'll pass on the Prawns Goebbels.
B004HAG40O|5.0|The Decemberists walked a very slippery slope on the edges of prog/pomp excess with The Hazards of Love and to a lesser event The Crane Wife, but The King is Dead is a return to form with an assortment of catchy, quirky, poignant songs like those of their earlier albums. A pleasant surprise in a period of disappointing new releases from many if not most of my favorite bands.
140130916X|5.0|I have always LOVED the movie and when I found out the book was really different I wanted to read it! I don't think I like either the book, nor the movie ending, but it was a great super easy read. Took me 2 days and I enjoyed it very much. I recommend this if you are wanting to laugh cry and enjoy a good book!
B001I0T92Q|2.0|The adapter is great. It worked well with my psp, using a class 4 16gb, and class 2 8 gb simultaneously.However, a week has passed, and the item proved defective. It's cracked somehow, and I really don't see how it could be my fault, since my previous single sd adapter endured me taking it in and out of the psp for almost half a year. The workmanship is obviously not quality stuff. I've requested a replacement, or a refund, hopefully I'll get one of the two. Besides that, the adapter works great.
B001I45UFC|2.0|a do not recomend this book i do not like it all if your planning to buy it return it. my dad made me read it so bad
B004NS710C|4.0|Much of the movie was predictable and implosable but it sure was exciting and fun to watch.  The two main actors developed a quick chemestry with each other which made the movie easy to sit through.  It was much better than some of the reviews out there that I read.  I'm glad I went ahead and rented anyway.  You should too.
0316098337|5.0|If your looking for something a little different...this is it!  An easy read that pulls you right in.  I would recommend this book without reservation.
0525423273|4.0|I won't go over the synopsis again as there are plenty of them here. I just wanted to add my two cents. :)<br /><br />I thought this was an adorable book. I really felt a connection to each of the characters, and for that I give Stephanie Perkins all the credit. She really did a great job giving them believable characteristics. The book was full of teenage angst, your typical \\"mean girl\\" drama and had a super sweet romance that I found believable in the evolution (for lack of a better word) of said relationship. The misunderstandings and repercussions that follow from lack of communication give this story credibility and made it a joy to read.<br /><br />The only complaint I have was that I felt it sort of ended abruptly. While it was obvious Perkins was wrapping the story up, I wanted more. Maybe that's why I felt it was so abrupt; I wanted to keep reading about Anna and Etienne. I did finish it in a few hours so that also may have had something to do with it. That being said, I really enjoyed Perkins writing style and do look forward to more from this new author.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|A poor man's Forrest Gump with an inexplicable gimmick tossed in. This really didn't need to be half as long as it was, and all the major scenes seemed like window dressing while the dull in-between moments were stretched out for as long as possible. It had a few charming scenes and some legitimately funny bits (especially the old man recounting his experiences with lightning) but give any film nearly three hours and a huge budget; the law of averages says it's bound to stumble across a few of those by sheer chance. Many of the character moments were forced and stiff, and there was almost zero chemistry between Blanchett and Pitt to back up their supposed lifelong passion for one another. Wrapping the whole story up into Hurricane Katrina just felt cheap and needless. A real disappointment.
0143118706|4.0|I enjoy Gilbert as a writer and her journeys.  This book is not as good as Eat, Pray, Love, but is still worthy as a summer read.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is a very moving, inspirational and uplifting motion picture. I remember when this actually happened and so it makes it that much better. I am particularly happy that Disney was the company to make this picture because of the need to present this story as it happened and how it happened.     The attention to detail, historical fact and the amount of emotion that was brought to the screen by some of the most capable actors in Holloywood. If you have not seen this motion picture, please do so. I promise that you will not be disappointed.  Reliving the moment when it happened, having watched Secretariat's very special year, remembering my father saying, \\"There is the next triple crown winner\\", after Secretariat's win at Saratoga. I watched history unfold and seeing that moment when Secretariat pulled away from pack at Pimlico during the \\"Preakness\\", I knew then, that I would never live to see this happen again, so far I have not and I am 59y/o, now, and was only 20y/o, when it happened.    See this motion picture, you are watching the \\"GREATEST HORSE IN HISTORY\\", and the all of the champion's that made it happen.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This book was a little confusing in the beginning but once you get into it, you can't put the book down. It's a never ending thrill ride. The only time you get to rest is when you actually put the book down. I read the book in less than 3 days. It's THAT good.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It is superbly done by Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Paul & Ringo and all the rest.  What a band and what a night.  A total delight from beginning to end.  A must have for George and/or Beatles fans.  All things must pass some day but, my sweet George, it is OK to look back and weep once in a while.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I've seen Paul McCartney several times, and while I didn;'t see this show at Citicorps, I did see him on this tour at Fenway. I brought my 20 y.o. son who was somewhat apprehensive (\\"How old is he now Pops?\\") but by the end of the concert he was saying \\"Wow! I knew he would be good, but I didn't think he's be so energetic and SO good\\".  Yeah.<br /><br />I avoided buying this set (the 4 disc deluxe edition) for awhile because I had read about allegations of auto-tuning on the CD (not true) and I felt it couldn't possibly match my memories of the concert. Ah - I was wrong. Paul was on a high, coming from the critically Last Play At Shea with Billy Joel,the Coachella Festival, and the Letterman appearance at the Ed Sullivan Theater where it all began. To say it re-energized him is an understatement - this is a man re-discovery his legacy, re-discovering his power, re-discovering himself.<br /><br />This is the soundtrack to my life.  Probably yours as well. Sound quality on the CDs is excellent. The DVDs are extraordinary. Yes, the quick cut cams are a bit annoying, but overall it is SO much better than other recent McCartney concert discs - particularly the Space Within Us Tour which (musically) was so exceptional.<br /><br />There will never be another Paul McCartney.  Has any other musician every brought so much joy to so many people?<br /><br />Godspeed Sir Paul.<br /><br />Buy this set.<br /><br />Today.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech was much more entertaining and approachable than I expected. Two hours covering a stiff monarch from seventy years ago and his endeavors with speech therapy? That sounds like a great cure to insomnia, but this had me ensnared almost from the first word. A great balance between light-hearted character moments, high-stress trials by fire before an entire nation and quiet personal struggles behind closed doors. After watching poor Albert struggle to open a supermarket in the first half of the film, I was ready to jump up and cheer when he finally put the demon to rest with the climactic radio address.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|My wife and I had attended this at the theater and loved it.    I pre-ordered if from Amazon and as soon as it came in the mail, we sat down and watched it again.    The movie is great.  This is a well acted, directed and produced movie.  There is no sex, no foul language and no violence, it is a movie with a great story and a great ending.  It can be enjoyed by all ages.    The Blu-ray with the extras including deleted scenes is also very good.    I have a small collection of CD's and DVD of around 400 + and this is one movie I will watch many more times.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|Another English/British production where the Portuguese People are portrayed as a bunch of retarded morons.    So typical from the Brits...
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Just a little background on me so you can judge my review, I'm not a hipster who just got into The Black Keys cause I heard them on a commercial or on letterman.  I'm a drummer who loves jazz.      For me, The Black Keys were, \\"the band I knew before everyone else did.\\"  I've been listening to The Black Keys ever since Rubber Factory hit the shelves.  I was recommended to them by a friend and I've never turned back since.  Rubber Factory was it for me and it still is my favorite album.  It had so much raw blues funk that could just keep you rockin for days.  How does Brothers compare to Rubber Factory or their first album The Big Come Up?  Well, all that rawness is gone.  For once, Dan and Pat have perfect equipment so now they have a perfect sound.  The car and jewelry commercials have paid off big time.  This album though, still has it's blues and soul.  Honestly, I love this album a lot more than their last one, Attack and Release.      Brothers just has that feel for me when I'm down and out or it's a late drive home.  Sure, it can be pretty poppy (which explains all of the fans all of a sudden and loss of the old fans) but I don't mind pop.  What's wrong with a song being catchy?  Dan is on point, writing great lyrics in my opinion and his falsetto on some songs is a great touch.  Although it's not raw, Dan still has that same old good distortion on his classic guitars.  Pat of course fills in the sound as always.      In conclusion, if you like The Black Keys and have listened to their old stuff like I have, don't write this album off so quickly.  I must admit, I did not like it at first AT ALL.  But, it grows on you.  It's one of those albums you have to play multiple times and when you do, you love it.      If you're new to the Keys, go ahead buy this one but make sure to definitely buy Rubber Factory too.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I chose to read this book because I happened to see it on Ellen's show and I felt the depth and power this book held for Portia and Ellen within seconds of them talking about it. I was transfixed on hearing her story, so I knew then and there I wanted to read it. I am not a follower of Portia de Rossi, in fact, never knew anything about her besides hearing she married Ellen. And going into this book knowing so little about the author did not matter at all. She possesses amazing writing skills and reels you in right away into her crazy, backwards life. It took her struggles with anorexia and being gay to finally see that she was indeed \\"good enough\\" all along. It's amazing to me that I felt like I wanted to ring Portia's neck and shake some sense into her, while at the same time, I wanted to stroke her back and comfort her because her situation was truly a very sad thing and not completely under her control. I felt many emotions throughout this book: I was shocked, saddened, mortified, jubilant, angry, depressed and the list goes on for how I felt towards and about Portia and her struggles. She is an excellent writer and really put the reader in her \\"place\\", a \\"place\\" I would never really want to be. Kudos for writing a raw, honest book and for no longer \\"putting on a face\\" for the media, your family, and the world. Besides Ellen, this book has given Portia what she needed in her life. Here is Portia, uncut.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|simply lovely! social network and inception were my top picks of 2010. social network i nominate for best pic of the year (we shall see what happens on feb 27th) and oddly enough i nominate inception for best pic of the decade (i know thats not a real thing...but what if it were? i think it would win!)
B000VWYJ86|3.0|I've read that the producers responsible for this series had never intended to make a third film, but when pressure from the studio grew, they had to come up with a few excuses to get the amnesiac action hero back under fire. That's certainly evident in Ultimatum's story, which does have its moments but never really shakes the feeling that it's just another adventure for Bourne and not an integral part of the overarching primary storyline. I had trouble getting invested in the hunt for the new government goons, after Supremacy effectively wiped out the last remaining string pullers, and it's never adequately explained what interest the new guys have in capturing / killing / hunting Jason. Julia Styles is crammed into the Franka Potente role of the wide-eyed, good looking field liability, but doesn't have the same kind of connection with Matt Damon that made the first relationship work so well and ultimately her enhanced role feels like a step back for the series. The action is still good, though, with a rooftop parkour chase through Tangiers being the highlight and another high-speed street chase that does its best to mimic the successes of the previous one (even ending in, basically, the exact same manner). However, the abundance of hand held shots are over the top. Rather than relegating them to just the action scenes, where they at least make sense, this time around we're getting the shaky treatment everywhere from baggage check at the airport to a sit-down conference in the pentagon. ENOUGH ALREADY. Having said that, I still enjoyed Ultimatum for what it was. It's a high speed thrill ride, but one that pales in comparison to the first two.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|After I received this turntable as a gift, I went online to read up on it before I hooked it up. When I found reviews saying that it was incompatible with Windows 7 and that you couldn't listen to the tracks through your computer speakers as you recorded them, I nearly packed it back up. Fortunately, I was stubborn enough to try it out for myself, and found that it *is* compatible with Windows 7 AND that I can listen to my records through my computer speakers as I record them   to digital files!     The following steps might be helpful in getting the records to play through your computer speakers:    Start menu> Control Panel> Hardware & Sound> Sound> Recording> Set Microphone (CODEC) as default, then right-click on it. Go to Properties, then Listen tab. Check box \\"listen to this device.\\"     While you're in the Properties menu you may also want to lower your levels (Levels tab); I had to drop mine to 3 or 4 to avoid massive amounts of reverb/feedback/general garbledness on my recordings, but YMMV. Similarly, when you record your albums (using Record/Restore Vinyl tab in the Sound Forge program), I found that checking \\"monitor levels\\" led to lots of noise, so I left the box unchecked and have had no problems getting good sound.     The software it comes bundled with isn't great for the layperson (it has scads of editing tools, none of which I'm really interested in playing with), and it doesn't seem to recognize track breaks--but maybe with time I'll figure it out. I've also read that other people have found different programs (Audigy, for instance) that work better, so there's always that option.     Overall, a good product, though it'd be improved by being packaged with simpler software.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is one of those books I saw at the store and thought, what a great summer read. Boy did this book deliver for me. I liked the delevopement of the charaters, the flow of the book, the twists and surprises and how it all comes together in the end. There is nothing about this book I didn't enjoy and if you are looking for something to sink your teeth into, yet flow through the story with little effort, this is a great read.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I love this movie & I can see over & over again. Watching it in blueray is cool but still enjoyable on reguLar DVD format. If you haven't watched this movie you are missing out big time.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I love the movie and it is action packed.  I love the series Firefly and the movie is great.  I wished they didn't end the series so soon.  The casts were great!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Prior to the release, I was very excited to read this book because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, by the last page, which I skimmed pretty much, I was sighing with disappointment, waiting for it to be over!    This book drraaggs on and on. This book could have been 200 pages shorter and a little bit more interesting. By the time I finished I felt like all the author was trying to proove was how smart she is and how many facts she knows about Darwin, Shakespeare, Alchemy, french and etc. I hadn't been hoping for an adult Twilight saga because I hate Twilight, and maybe I'm just a little tired of the pansy vampire story, but I was hoping for a different take on witches. However, I felt it was leaning more towards cauldrens, pointed hats and brooms. The sterotypes that are frustrating. I did appreciate that the vampires were supposed to be something to be feared though.     The plot had started out good, with Diana struggling from keeping her magic locked inside herself and a mysterious manuscript that held all the secrets about creatures, but there was only a few chapters of the book that I had been really hooked. Eventually, you compltely forget about the manuscript because after a few chapters its never mentioned. Otherwise, the plot seemed to move all over the place. Like other readers, I DID NOT feel any passion or romance between Matthew and Diana. All of a sudden, after a few yoga lessons, they were mated and then came the 'mon coeur's and the I love you's and Diana completely left her personality behind. I was waiting and hoping for Diana to be like, 'wait a cotton picking minute' and actually have a mind of her own once more. But no, she just turned into a mindless drone that did anything her vampire told her to(Katie Holmes anyone?) just because she loved him and blah blah boring blah. I was also bored with the whole Oxford/ Ivy League snobbery, the large amounts of wine they drank and the detail in which the author describes the wine.    I wouldn'trecommend this book to anyone that was looking for a fresh take on vampires and witches. I was relieved when I finished it.
B001HN69AY|3.0|The latest in a long line of confounding Terry Gilliam movies that I can't decide whether to love or hate. Parnassus comes fully equipped with the director's requisites: drastically eccentric characters, gorgeous cinematography, far-left-field humor, delicate plot and utterly befuddling dialog. The scenes set inside the imaginarium itself are fantastic, dream logic-dominated landscapes on par with Michel Gondry's best work, where we're encouraged to celebrate the fact that absolutely nothing is static and chaos rules. Unfortunately, the real world scenes do nothing to lasso the film to the ground in any way, a function which was desperately needed. When the dust settled, I... think... I understood what this was all about? That's more than I could've said for some of the Python alum's other work, at least after one viewing. Either way, it's basically a moving painting. You take away what you can and just accept that some parts of it aren't supposed to be comprehended by anyone but the artist.
B003YOWU1Q|2.0|Over produced. A dissapointment. But any thing is better that the lyrical diarhea that was \\"Meg White\\"! Go back to Trouble and Till The Sun Turns Black...PLEASE. I love and miss the old Ray.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I was very happy with my order. It came fast in the mail. It was a complete, neatly and nicely packaged set that has all the matrix in there , and more.
0684857219|5.0|I received this book quickly and it was in good shape. I love the fact that I bought it from the Goodwill and the money I spent on the book is going towards helping others. Yay, Goodwill!!
030746363X|5.0|this book is excellent.  He is very generous with his knowledge, doesn't assume that the reader is dumb.  He shares much medical research and makes it interesting.  He really believes we can handle this knowledge,  it's about time!
0802473156|5.0|Ordered this book after it was a favorite on \\"The View\\"  Been married 46 years and found it interesting and informative.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|I had no idea how Danny Boyle would manage to make the tale of a man trapped beneath a boulder for the better part of a week into an interesting feature-length, but the director did a nice job of shaking things up with flashbacks, hallucinations, dreams and inventive uses for the videotaped confessionals. Really, though, the whole movie boils down to the effectiveness of the eventual amputation, which was jarringly powerful and surprisingly effective. I may not have been able to identify with the dehydration, desperation and delusions of Aron Ralston's six-day struggle beforehand, but everything from the visuals to the sound effects of that climactic scene had me right there with him, feeling that sick, unsettling sensation in the pit of the stomach. That twenty minutes was gruesomely riveting. The rest of the film... tense, if not spectacular.
1412960991|5.0|Yin's book of Case Study Research is the best of the subject and can be held as a classic of the field.  This fourth edition of 2009 is modern and gives a solid basis for the researchers.
B003ES5ZTG|5.0|I bought this wire after reading a Popular Mechanics article about overpriced HDMI cables (they said there's no visible quality difference between a 10 dollar and 60 dollar HDMI cable). The adjustable hinges also allow me to completely hide the cable behind my Playstation 3 and television. I highly recommend this product and thank you Amazon for selling it.
0060527986|5.0|this is an excellent book to read every day.  It is broken up into small lessons,  so  it gives you something to learn,  or contemplate each day.   Taken up each day,  it  adds up to maturity.
0670022411|5.0|When I was a little girl, I dreamed of being a witch with all of the magic and mystery that went into it.  I was a witch every year for Halloween and wore capes during dress up play to be a witch.  This book captured all of my imaginery play as a child and took me back to a time when all of it seemed possible.  This book is an escape--dressed up well in the realities of adult life.  It took me back to a time when anything was possible and while I was reading it, I was completely in that world.  True, there are some slow spots in this book but even during those, I was completely immersed in the story.  If you are looking for a book that will take you away from it all, this is the one.
B003Q6D25U|1.0|You might as well sit down and watch a security cam monitor for 91 minutes. One of the most disappointing \\"movies\\" I've ever watched. Please do not fall for the hype.
B00005V9HH|4.0|A good enough crime saga with some great one-liners and several sharp twists and turns, but not something I'd revere alongside the all-timers. I felt like there was too much reliance on name dropping and intentional complications, which I guess fits in with the big twist at the very end, but that doesn't suddenly make it excusable. Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way; it's a good-to-very good story that often gets too caught up in itself.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|This film had great potential.  All the reviews about the incredible scenery and location are correct.  Italy is beautiful... but... we all know that already, don't we?    The opening scene was great, and the movie was off to a rousing start!  But, then it just fell off, and fell hard.  Who were the Swedes chasing him? Why were the Swede's chasing him? What's the history there?      Perhaps the character is on a journey of self-discovery? If he is, then that point is pretty much missed.  He decides he wants out, yeah, we ALL know what that means.  It means that the \\"bosses\\" are going to try to kill him.  But who DOES he work for? The man who's the \\"boss\\", who is he? Who does he work for?    The previews marketed this as an \\"action\\" tale, a thriller, a quickly-paced movie with action and adventure.  It is NONE of those.  If it's a drama, a character study, okay, I can accept that (even if the characters are really pretty blah)... but wouldn't it make more sense to market the movie as such? Perhaps it would get better reviews if it was targeted to an audience that was into dry, diaglog-less, slow-paced, scenery films?
0670022411|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and easy to read. I especially enjoyed the author's ability to put you into the story. It felt like I was there. A really good story. I expected just another vampire/witch story and got something else entirely. Try it. It's a great read.
B0042KZJ46|2.0|Hi everyone... first of all, i never would pretend to be Marley reporter, a collector, just as much people, a person who loves his music and heart believer of the message of unity and love; i was a supporter too of the Marley´s Family work, always giving the back to te bad intentioned commentarys and destructive critics, about, how them manage the Bob´s legacy and material. But today my conception of the things have change a little. This concert already was on many collector and fan hands, the version that has been rollin durong decades of this concert was an audience recording, and for some lucky ones, the recordins in tape of the technician Dennis Thompson, this final version comes from that one!!! Off course i am happy to have this concert on this format, but the sound quality is incredible bad...  My surprise?' it reached my home today, then i opened the package, and what i´ve found??? advertising of new Marley brands... Marley beverage, marley sound goods.  adding to this the Marleys merchandise from years ago: Marley Spa in Nassau, Marley Cofee from the son with lack of musical talent, etc... My conclussion: don´t matter the quality neither the essence... the only reason for this playing to be in a CD, is to have Marley products to sell. Today i started to doubt about the handling of the Bob´s legacy without falling on criticism or destructive comments.

B000VBJEEG|4.0|Like every single one of Pixar's films, this was witty, beautiful and genuine, but in the end felt like light fare compared to some of the studio's masterworks. It didn't have the suspense of The Incredibles, the heart of Up or the scale of Wall-E, for example, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive. Ah, well. My least favorite Pixar effort is still better than most of the competition.
B00371QQ34|4.0|I ordered this Blu-Ray/DVD combo as aresult of an Amazon promo. It was well worth the money.  It was refreshing to see Bruce Willis & Sidney Potier (surprise) in this movie.  Mr Poitier played a very convincing and distinguished CIA operative desperate to find the assassin-for-hire (Jackal) played by Bruce.  The acting by these two gentlemen is refreshing. Just pay a little attention to the dialogue and you should have no problem feeling the pace and excitement of this quality movie.  Look for a surprising appearance by an recent actor, who younger viewers (& those with kids) should have no trouble recognizing. Hint (China's State animal, also herbivore)!!    The movie itself is set in the WW2-era and some of the dialogue may throw you for a while, esp. if you are not familiar with Cold War attitudes and mentalities. I'm very curious to see what liks and info (via BD_live) are avialable on the Blu-Ray version.  Perhaps someone out there could give me a preview.    Buy this movie.  its one of those you can watch over and over again !!
B0047WJ12K|2.0|Inception is movie to watch in a theater not at home.  The movie is long (2 1/2 hours?) fast paced and is difficult to follow unless you give it your full attention.  I had to backup the movie to catch what had happened too many times.    Unfortunetly I didn't find the lead character sympathetic enough to hold my interest.  The special effects were good, but seemed to repeat, the snow machines were the best part of the film.  The ending was unrealistic.  I did watch the whole movie but it was a struggle, never again.
B00008BXJG|5.0|All hard core AC/DC fans know that their 70s albums are all five star gems but...lets take a closer look. To start with: the first four studio albums are available in two seperate versions, with some different tracks and some different mixes, also the cover art was completly different, except 'Powerage' (where only the reverse cover is a bit different). 'T.N.T.' was retitled 'High Voltage'...side one is the same but side two has 2 alternate tracks. I was told by one person that there is an import version of H2H that has different mixes but I can't confirm it's existance. If anyone knows for sure please leave a comment. My 'Powerage' import has a alternate mix of 'Kicked In The Teeth'...the vocal and lead guitar is more raw, not the same take as the American version. 'Cold Hearted Man' is the alternate track. I've not been able to find the import albums on CD, but I still have my vinyl and cassettes. I've not seen 'If You Want Blood' (the live album 1978) as an import either. H2H broke the name AC/DC worldwide...the band had been associated to a degree with Punk Rock, but that was soon to change. The world of analogue recording was at its climax, the best sound yet available (excepting quadrophonic). The bass register and bottom end were thicker starting in 78/79. Cliff Willams and Phil Rudd sound outstanding on this album, their finest work in my opinion. Listen to the bass on 'Get It Hot' the drums on 'Walk All Over You'...power and precision together with subtle inventiveness define each band members role. The lyrics are so complete and true to life (mostly about $women)...look at the titles: highway, girls, walk, touch, bush, shot, hot, blood, love, prowler. However this material has more criptic symbolism pertaining to war...i.e. hell, rythym, over you, to much, beating, flames, get it, if you want, hungry, night...Kinda' leaves you in the dark, where U.F.O.s are often seen! Shaz-Bot? Nanu Nanu? Was Bon an alien? Did he die or metamorphisize? Was he assassinated? How's this for intrique: take notice of the cover art...Bon stands apart from the band, laughing (band not), with a red glow between them, notice the tail in Angus Youngs' hand if you look closely it has a yellowish stripe like a 'highway' then see that the point of the tail is pointed precisley, exactly down. The tail represents the \\"HIGH\\"way To Hell. The title is perfect, the cover is perfect, the lyrics are perfect, the music is rock solid perfection first to last note. The production quality i.e. no pause between songs and killer sound...This record simply could'nt be better! Bag-pipes, bells and cannons have their place on other albums...this one is a perfect game! I'll admit I detect some wear in Bon's vocal chords and there's no wonder why. He could feel it, examine the 'Powerage' cover closely, notice the triangle point on Angus Youngs' shoulder it points exactly strait up, on one side the word 'power' is decending while on the other 'age' is ascending, like a see-saw. The first three import albums have completely different covers. There's more to H2H than meets the ears, it's a legal document in the court of creation. Since 1981 when my best freind put headphones on my head practicly forcing me to listen to this \\"Punk\\" band and then had to put me in a head-lock to gets his mini tape player back. Or '82 when this was the first tape I picked out the first time I bought music, I still break H2H out nearly every year, I have the same 29 year old tape and it's among the best sounding recordings: album, 8-track, cassette, or CD that I own...approaching 2000 recordings not including four to five hundred of my own music. AC/DC was the cutting edge in 1979 then in 1980 they rewrote musical history............P.S. there is an import album released in 1980 entitled 'High Voltage' the cover features a cartoon dog peeing on a transformer. Eight total songs circa. 1975 six of which don't appear on the American releases, including 'Soul Stripper' \\"a killer song\\" a coverof 'Baby Please Don't Go' and a mellow 'Love Song' you've never heard Bon like this. I'll list the differences between versions some future date when I have them at hand to reference. It's time now for a toast to a true legend R.I.P.
B0041QSZJM|4.0|I'm a huge Pink Martini fan, and this CD did not disappoint.  Played it all holiday season long, and a I bought several as gifts too.  I highly recommend!
B002ZHKZCO|4.0|As a standalone film, this still works very well. The action scenes, brief and scattered as they may be, are very well done and (mostly) grounded, especially by Hollywood standards. It's not quite as smart as it would like you to believe, but is intelligent enough to avoid becoming a stereotypically brainless puncher, and I enjoyed the constantly-flipping roles of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between Bourne and his handlers. The ending was too abrupt, tying everything up into too neat of a package and omitting a lot of vital details along the way, but I guess that's what the sequels were for.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I picked this up on a whim, being a big fan of Malazan, and Wheel of Time. This book is fantastic. Sanderson has a great writing style that's a bit different than the rest of the genre, and it makes for some seriously page-turning reading.<br /><br />Kelsier has to be one of the best fantasy POV characters ever written. Hopefully we'll get some prequel novels with his backstory!
0470570954|1.0|You can't buy a copy of the last three chapters of this book.  You can only buy the privilege of looking at them for a few days.  If I wanted to just look at a book for a few days, I would go to the library.  The main point of having a book is that it's there for reference later.<br /><br />So it doesn't matter how good the content would be if you could buy a copy.  If you can't buy it, you can't buy it.  That earns an automatic zero.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|The last 20 minutes of the movie were the best parts....the rest of the film was filler and not really that scary in any means....the first one was more suspensfull but this one had its parts as in the end...i wish that closet door in the baby's room would have opened, that would of made it even better =p.....the ending was kool, some sweet revenge( watch it and you will see how it is revenge)...overall it was a ok movie...needed more suspense as in the first one

B0035G5IOE|3.0|This is pretty much exactly how I imagined a stop-motion Wes Anderson movie would turn out. The first two acts are really clever, warm and quirky, then the third drags on forever. Anderson brings along his usual cast of collaborators, who once again pull a miracle by feeling right at home in the new characters' skins, and the handful of new additions fit right in alongside them. George Clooney is perfectly cast as the slightly shady, endlessly charismatic lead, Willem Dafoe provides a great cameo and everyone's performances seem to key off of that shared energy. This was mostly charming and wholly entertaining as a goofball throwback to the old school of stop-motion animation that's sure to get better with repeat viewings.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|great movie. IMO Val Kilmer's best movie. the video and audio quality on this blu ray is BREATHTAKING!!!!!!  on an LG LED 60\\" its like you are THERE!!!!!!
B004I9TQLI|5.0|I watched this movie after wanting to see if for a while. I actually loved it from the trailer, which after watching the actual movie made me love it even more! Bruno was such a sweet little boy who didn't understand what was going on, and didn't want to believe what he was being told about the Jews. He was plainly trying to help his new friend out when his fate got twisted in the horrifying ending. I honestly have not read the book, so I didn't expect the ending at all! It left me in silence, hoping that in my \\"happily ever after\\" expectancy of a movie Bruno would cross the screen after somehow miraculously escaping the gas chambers. Nope. It's pretty bad that's what I was waiting for as the screen faded out, and after it went black. But overall, great movie definitely recommend to people!
B004529NKM|5.0|This came in perfect condition, and was an absolutely awesome movie, even my bf who doesn't usually like my \\"dance\\" movies really enjoyed it.
B002ZHKZCY|5.0|Doing away with the whole hand-holding innocent civilian tagalong effect that slowed down the original, this sequel concentrates on Jason outsmarting the entire black ops wing of the US government at every turn. With the premise set completely by the first movie, Supremacy is free to quit worrying about the setup and dive right into the action and weighty plot developments. Though I noted several scenes that were more than coincidentally similar to the original, they were each amped up a couple notches and paired with enough original material to retain a unique identity (no pun intended). The story does a fine job of picking up on the dangling threads of the original and wrapping them all up into a rewarding, conclusive finale. There was a bit too much shaky-cam in the action scenes for my liking, but this was in theaters when the concept was still fresh and it does lend a slightly more believable look and feel than you'll get from the classic polished Hollywood fights.
0670022411|5.0|`A Discovery of Witches' is the debut paranormal novel from Deborah Harkness.<br /><br />I was initially intimidated by this 592-page extravaganza . . . but I've been reading very good reviews and was encouraged by more than a few people to persevere. So I did, and I was rewarded.<br /><br />Diana is the last of the Bishop witches. An ancient and powerful line dating back to the Salem witch trials, Diana is a witch twice-over. Her mother was a Bishop, and her father a Proctor, an esteemed magician in his own right. But Diana's powerful parents were killed by humans when she was just eight-years-old, and she has been scarred ever since. Diana made a promise to herself a long time ago, that she didn't need magic. She would not be taught by her aunts, Sarah and Emily, and she would never rely on a coven of sister-witches.<br /><br />Diana spent her young adulthood trying to control her compelling magic, and in adulthood she has devoted herself to academics instead of spirits. She is one of the youngest professors at Oxford University, specializing in alchemy and spending her time with dusty manuscripts. She lives a quiet, orderly life devoid of magic . . . until the day the magic finds her.<br /><br />An old and mysterious book arrives for Diana's perusal. In the hush of Oxford's Bodleian Library, Ashmole 782 sings to Diana. It is a book of great power and many secrets, and Diana is terrified. . .<br /><br />The moment the book sits before her, strange things start happening. Other witches cast her envious glances. Demons begin sending her kisses and stalking her in the stacks. Her apartment is broken into. And Diana meets the mysterious and breath-taking vampire, Professor Matthew Clairmont.<br /><br />Matthew has been hunting down Ashmole 782 for centuries. The old alchemical book is said to hold a great many secrets about the supernatural races - demons, witches and vampires. But Diana is the first in hundreds of years to break the spell and read the book. Now all those supernatural races are curious and enviable of Diana, and she is in great danger. Matthew doesn't know why he cares so much, but he is drawn to Professor Bishop. She shimmers, and her blood entices. She uses magic all the time, every day, without realizing it. She is an enigma who calls out his most territorial behaviors.<br /><br />`A Discovery of Witches' is no light read. At 592-pages, this novel is epic and sprawling - an absolute feast of fantasy that will engross and imprint on you. There's a little bit of every paranormal pleaser, from witches to vampire and daemons. There's a star-crossed inter-species romance and twining, interlocking mysteries. `A Discovery of Witches' is really a paranormal saga.<br /><br />The novel does have a slow start, but only because Harkness's epic storytelling demands calm before the storm. The meandering opening lulls the reader, and Diana, into a false sense of security. The Oxford setting is wonderful, with Harkness evoking the Gothic spires of the old school with a supernatural twist, as Diana is surrounded by student daemons and vampiric professors. In the opening we learn about Diana and her difficult childhood, losing her parents at a young age and rejecting her magic because of their deaths. Diana has led an ambitiously academic life ever since, rejecting the covens of Oxford and her aunts attempts to bring her into the sisterhood . . . until Ashmole 782 lands on her desk and helps unleash her magic.<br /><br />The novel kicks into a higher-gear when Diana meets Professor Matthew Clairmont - a fifteen-hundred-year-old vampire. In this world, there is barely-suppressed hostility between the demons, witches and vampires. But Diana and Matthew have an immediate connection - there is lust and home between them.<br /><br />Once Diana and Matthew begin their illicit affair, the novel really sizzles and the mystery burns. Diana's powers are coming fast and furious since stumbling upon Ashmole 782 and meeting Matthew. But does her vampire lover want her, or the secrets of the book?<br /><br />The romance between Matthew and Diana is the big draw-card of Harkness' novel. The romance is as sprawling and epic as the mystery itself. Matthew has a shady past; murders weigh on his conscience and the constant pull of Diana's blood is a cocked-gun waiting to go off. These two have a lot to contend with, but theirs is a tender and fated romance to invest in.<br /><br />Deborah Harkness' `A Discovery of Witches' is `Practical Magic' meets Donna Tartt. There's a little bit of paranormal for everyone and a fantastic old-world scholastic setting. The mystery of the book is captivating and twisted - especially when it's so closely connected to Diana's emerging witchy powers. The novel does end on a question-mark cliff-hanger . . . but `Discovery' is the first book in what will be a series from Harkness, and I can't wait for more. Yes, this is a whopping 592-page book; but that just means there's more paranormal to love and a romance to really get invested in.

It also points out about good design principles whenever it is required.     I personally believe, it is a very good book to read for beginners. So that they practice TDD from the beginning.

0307454541|5.0|Masterful piece of art. Very well written, amazing and thrilling storyline. A truly must read yesterday.<br />Perfect whodunit story. You will never ever guess what happened and in the end you will be shocked.<br />I was so far off balance I had to read chapter that explained everything again and again still twirling in shock. Oh but wait, that is not all. Larsson bombards you with another flying saucer of thrills.<br />Not what I thought it would be. I went into this story with a one track mind because I have heard so many people say it was boring. NO WAY! This story had all of the thrills, adventure, and excitement.<br />I was happy that Lisbeth and Mikael were not your average people. That is what set this story apart from others.  The only thing that got confusing was all of the Vangers' through the story.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I've been a Kanye fan for awhile, and have loved his past albums, especially graduation, but MBDTF is on a entirely different level. I can feel passion, pain, soul in the music. It's intricacies are wonderful. I agree with others, I don't like \\"Blame Game\\", but I really don't care that its on there, the album is complete without it.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|From the opening titles and music (Regina Spektor - Us), I sensed I was in for a unique and memorable experience.  All the muses must have been present when this film was written and conceived.  The perfectly placed nonlinear narrative and, of course, the wonderful musical score make (500) Days Of Summer an instant romantic-comedy classic.  I loved it more than you can know.  Zooey Deschanel (who I always used to confuse with Alessandra Torresani -- [[ASIN:B002ZCY872 Caprica: Season 1.0]]) was mesmerizing. Oh, yes, the ending:  One of the best I've seen in quite a while.  Highly recommended.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|People will bash this movie for \\"trying to rip off the Bourne movies\\". In no way does it rip those movies off. Its a good old action movie with lots of...well action. Angelina Jolie can put most male actors in their place when it comes to being an action star. Sure, the story is a little weak in some areas, but most action movies are like that. It's a fun movie to watch; it's got non-stop action, a hot lead, and cool stunts. Just keep in mind, it's a movie, not everything she does is real.     Also, great price. Lower then walmart.com and any other site and it shipped quickly using standard shipping.
1416562605|5.0|\\"The White Tiger\\" by Aravind Adiga is a tremendously interesting novel, providing a look at society in India with a black comedic view which hooks the reader from the start.  The story is told via a series of communications from Balram Halwai to Wen Jiabao, the Premier of China, about what it is to be an entrepreneur.  This debut novel won the Man Booker Prize in 2008.  Adiga has a lot to comment on in this work, from Indian society, to Indian politics, the caste system, to religion and art.  Dealing with subjects as personal as one's family, to as broad as globalization and the world order.    Munna (a.k.a. Balram Halwai) comes from a small village (Laxmangarh) in Bihar.  His family was very poor, and he isn't even given a proper name as \\"munna\\" means \\"boy\\" in Hindi.  He is smart and is promised a scholarship, but family obligations take that away from him and he is forced to work instead of going to school.  The caste system and the way society operates work against Balram for most of the book.  The system is designed to keep people at the same level or push them down, and it takes morally reprehensible actions to work against the flow to try to move upwards in society.  Balram tells Wen Jiabao of the crime he committed at the end of his first communication, but the details, and the even greater immoral sacrifice that he makes are left until much later, though there are hints of it during the telling of the story.    The inverse relationship between morality and power plays a significant role throughout the book, and with all the characters.  Balram finds himself on both sides of the equation as well, and these are undoubtedly lessons which he uses to escape his cage, or as he calls it the rooster coop.  The contrast between the \\"Darkness\\" and the \\"Light\\" is another one which Aravind Adiga uses throughout the book.  And it is important to note that it is not the case that the poor in the \\"Darkness\\" are not pure while the wealthy in the \\"Light\\" are immoral, it is rather the case that each caste is willing to do what it must to survive at its level, and that the crimes one must commit to maintain oneself in the \\"Light\\" are just that much worse.  Balram propels himself into the light with a crime, but then acts in a more moral way than most, or at least attempts to justify himself with such a story.  At the same time, he even discusses another immoral act he may need to commit to maintain his social position.    \\"The White Tiger\\" is an absorbing read, and I was drawn further into it with each page.  Balram's narration brings the story to life, and he is a fascinating character filled with contrasts.  He considers himself a \\"White Tiger\\", and yet when he comes face to face with one in the zoo, he faints.  He writes as if he is only loyal to himself, and yet often acts in a way which does not benefit himself the most.  At times he is quite moral, and yet at a key time he is able to commit a horrible crime, with consequences so great that most people could never take such an action.  Above all, though, he is intelligent, and a survivor.  I've read a number of excellent books recently, and this one is right up there in the top tier.
B000002JSH|3.0|\\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"Good Lovin' Gone Bad,\\" were the hits, even if neither of them became the monster that \\"Can't Get Enough\\" was while both of them deserved to be. But in trying to follow up a monster debut, and live up to their image as a supergroup (two ex-Free, one ex-Mott the Hoople, one ex-King Crimson), Bad Company came up with a no-questions-asked masterpiece in \\"Shooting Star,\\" singer Paul Rodgers' elegy to his fallen former Free bandmate, the transcendentally minimalist blues-rock guitarist Paul Kossoff, who'd died of heart failure---and right as Bad Company were preparing to work on this album, yet---after several years of weakening due to drug abuse.     Not only does Rodgers write a mostly straightforward lament--and an inadvertent prophecy of his new band's eventual fate in hand with it---but he sings with the deepest emotional commitment to the material since the best of his Free days. And he gets precisely what he needs from the rest of the Company here, from Mick Ralphs's guitar wail to Boz Burrell's urgent bass and Simon Kirke's (a fellow Free teammate) emphatetic, even sensitive drumming.    Those were (and remain) the highlights. The remainder of the material is, alas, the kind of journeyman-sounding stuff that was about to become the dominant factor in Bad Company's oeuvre. It's played with guts and finesse at once, it's sung with depth enough, but there's the pervading sense that these four could and should have done better. Unfortunately, beginning with the next album, \\"Run with the Pack,\\" it turned out that they couldn't have done better, that they'd fired their most powerful ammunition over most of the first album and a little more than half of this one. Which was (and remains) a shame, because there really did seem as though there were something special there for awhile. Even now, classic rock-oriented bar bands keep at least one Bad Company selection in their set lists, usually from the first two albums, and sometimes including \\"Shooting Star,\\" which only reminds you---just like the best of this album---even more of what could have been.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|When it comes to modern rock singer/songwriters, there is PJ Harvey and everyone else. This generation does not have a Dylan, Young or Mitchell walking through the door anytime soon (sorry Bright Eyes and S. Stevens.) Let England Shake is another masterpiece and her fans are going to have to follow her lead or get left behind.<br /><br />Like Bowie, Harvey is constantly changing. Here's a quick run down: Punk goddess on \\"Dry\\" n' \\"Rid of Me.\\" Magical temptress on \\"To Bring you My Love\\" n'\\"... Desire.\\" She threw her fans a bone and gave them exactly what they wanted on the excellent yet relatively safe \\"Stories...\\" She quickly snatched the bone away with \\"Uh Huh Her\\" n' \\"White Chalk.\\" \\"Let England Shake\\" is not an easy listen. With time, it may prove to be her best.<br /><br />War? What is it good for? (Sorry, couldn't resist.) It's good for a spine tingling journey through the past, present and future of England. PJ mentions the hills, trees, landscapes within the context of battles that have shaped both her and the rest of the world. The price paid was and remains high. The lyrics on this album are some of the best of her career. She no longer pines for a lover or howls at the sea. She sings of life during wartime and the horrific reality of death.<br /><br />While the hard charging Harvey of old may have been a perfect match for the bleak subject matter, the alt queen opts for a less obvious solution: sing sweetly and let the darkness in slowly but surely.<br /><br />There are no obvious singles or sing a-longs here. The instruments float in and out like London fog. A sax steps in for a strummed guitar. A pretty harp or piano juxtaposes a harrowing tale. On The Last Living Rose, a torn Harvey sings the praises of a country where glistening gold sells for nothing. The line from All And Everyone, \\"advancing in the sun... sing Death to all and everyone\\" ranks as one of popular music's most chilling moments because of the sad and beautiful way Polly Jean delivers it.<br /><br />Let England Shake will not be a soundtrack to anyone's spring or summer. It's much more: it's a soundtrack for humanity in the 20th and 21st centuries. Thanks Polly Jean for leading singer/songwriters and music fans to unknown destinations. I will follow...e a soundtrack to anyone's spring or summer. It's much more: it's a soundtrack for humanity in the 20th and 21st centuries.

B001CD3PLU|1.0|First of all, let me say that I love The Goonies movie. This review is not about the movie.    The copy of the movie that is being offered here is not a Region 1 (USA) copy. It is a Region 2 (Europe) copy. It is not a 1080p version of the movie either, which is easy enough to see when you view it. There weren't any previews, copyright protection notices, chapters or any menus on the disc either. Once the movie starts to play it can only be paused, stopped, fast forwarded or rewound, no skipping to the next chapter (it wasn't encoded with chapters). This disc doesn't have any extras, menus, commentaries or anything.    I have lived all over the world and have movies from all over the world in my collection. However, this copy looks and feels like an illegal copy that you can pick up for a couple of dollars at any Southeast Asia Electronics market. If this is an illegal copy, it would be the first Blu-ray copy that I have seen; maybe the bootleg market has caught up to Blu-ray already, but I hope not. The \\"shrink wrap\\" on this movie was not a factory shrink wrap either, again, it was the type of wrapping you find on illegal bootleg copies; it looks like its sealed by a peel and stick type of wrapper.     As a comparison, I watched my DVD version, up-converted by my BD Player. The DVD version was of a higher quality and I had all of the menus and chapters.     In short, don't be scammed by this bad bootleg copy.

0061564893|5.0|This is a book that is so packed full of information you need to read it carefully to process all of it.   We, here in the west, know little or nothing about the orient.  It is amazing to read of the sophistication and  knowledge that china possessed.  Even though it was still barbaric in many of its customs, the scientific, medical,  and navigational skills were so advanced, it is hard to imagine compared to the European situation in the same time period.  I would recommend this book to everyone.

0802130208|5.0|It was a crime what happened to this man. Confederacy of Dunces was a masterpiece when it was penned in the early 1960's, it was a masterpiece when Toole took his own life in 1969. It was a masterpiece when Walker Percy finally got it published by the LSU Press in 1980. And it was a masterpiece after it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1981! And it is a masterpiece today. I ABSOLUTELY love this book. I really don't think you can touch it.     On a sidenote, I met this writer in Philadelphia (Thomas Muldoon)who also loved Confederacy. He was an interesting young man and though I didn't believe him at the time, he told me had his own book. Turns out he was telling the truth and Smoking in Bathrooms turned out to be a very funny read.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I got this movie because its a Predator movie. Boy was I in for a treat!<br /><br />It looks, feels and sounds like the first but its not. The action and plot was great IMO but the only thing missing was a mad minute...I was dissapointed in Laurence Fishburn's roll in this movie.<br />(Stinkin psychotic weasle!)<br /><br />This is a movie where I think Michelle Rodriguez would really shine. Adrien Brody reminds me of the last guy that got whacked by the tree truck trap in the first Predator movie. There are a few refences to the first movie and the finale was like a tribute.<br /><br />I am trying not to spoil it by revealing any of the story. Please bear with my vagueness. The action left me wanting more and the ending seemed to promised it.

B0015DROBO|1.0|I was excited when I found this book for sale, used, at our library.  I had seen it so many places, I figured it must be hugely popular.<br /><br />I should have been tipped off when I was told it took 100 pages to \\"get into it\\".  I have never wasted 100 pages to become interested in a book.  One chapter, tops.  If a book doesn't have my interest by then, I can't trust it to keep my interest.  I should have gone with my gut.  The first 100 pages are bogged down in back story and irrelevant details.<br /><br />The story did pick up in the middle, but it was full of violence that I found disturbing.  It also bothered me that the main character hopped from one bed to another while other characters were being horribly violated.  By the end of the book, rape seemed to be dinner conversation.<br /><br />As if the first 100 page drag wasn't enough, the last 100 pages were equally boring and drawn out.<br /><br />I've read better writing from 15 year old kids.  I won't be wasting my time or money on the other two books.

B000023ZMC|5.0|Avant-garde can be a very noisy, sometimes aimless genre, but these guys do it right. Throughout this album, they switch from slick Canterbury-style jazz (like on \\"Nirvana for Mice\\") and very unique and extremely listenable avant (such as on the introduction to \\"Teenbeat\\"). The entire album is a well crafted piece, but the conclusion, \\"The Nine Funerals for the Citizen King\\" wraps it up nicely with the unique vocals, harmonized beautifully by the guitar (which sounds almost like a synthesizer) and well complemented by the violin! Another favorite of mine is \\"Amygdala\\" as it almost sounds like something from Hatfield and the North and includes a flute solo which is very unique for even the Cow. Frank Zappa once said, \\"Talking about music is like dancing about architecture\\" and this record aptly fits that quote as it defies words! If you like creative and innovative music, just go buy it. You won't be disappointed.    I'm editing to add a last word about the sound quality. Whereas many avant artists such as Captain Beefheart (RIP) had rather murky sounding records, something that I appreciate about Henry Cow is their production is extremely clean and crisp, allowing the listener to hear every nuance of the recording, which is essential for this kind of music as it requires close attention to detail to understand. Truly a class act.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|the blu ray version of this film is very nice. It's looks great, very good sound efects, comes with two different versions of the movie: the original one that was showed in theaters and another version with some extra scenes. Totally recomend it.

You get parts of going to brazil from \\"1916\\", parts from the \\"Kiss of Death\\" and \\"Motorizer\\"    The lyrics and vocals are well delivered. I heard from reading \\"professional\\" reviews Lemmy struggled to deliver on this album. I think the exact opposite of that. He sounds as strong as ever and at parts he sounds like his voice did in the 90's. The rhyming and catchyness to the entire album do have a feel of 90's Motorhead. Some songs like I KNOW HOW TO DIE and I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED def. sound like they could have been off \\"1916\\"    GET BACK IN LINE has a very great lyric IMO. It almost seems like it could be as big as the lyc off Ace of Spades \\"You know I'm gonna lose and gamblings for fools but thats the way I like it baby I don't wanna live forever\\" GET BACK IN LINE has a very clever rhyming Lyc that I think should be on the same field of play with that line. \\"....Why do we vote for faceless dogs ? We always take the bait, All things come to he who waits, But all things come too late !!!\\"    Lemmys lyrics are a lot better than on Motorizer or Kiss of Death, and I loved those albums. I just can't comprehend how the music seems to be getting better.    My rating for their past four albums :    1. Inferno & The World is Yours          (Tie)  2. Kiss of Death  3. Motorizer  4.      The breakdown of the tracks are as follows.      1.  Born To lose              10/10           (someone once said the first track off a motorhead album always seems to be like their next huge concert song this is no exception)    2.  I know how to die        9.5/10   (You'll find yourself trying to sing this one with a Lemmy voice)  3.  Get Back In line          10/10   (Just too good not to like)  4.  Devils In My Head        9.5/10   (Catchy and good riffs)  5.  Rock 'n' Roll Music       10/10   (This song is awesome and is so true as long as Motorhead still going)  6.  Waiting for the Snake    8.5/10   (Not my fav. however the riff in the song kicks a$$)  7.  Brotherhood of Man        10/10   (like someone else said seems like it could have been off Orgasmatron)  8.  Outlaw                    10/10   (Just may be my fav. song off the album)  9.  I Know What You Need       9/10   (Very catchy, no filler here at the end of the album)  10. Bye Bye Bit*h Bye Bye      9/10   (A good way to end the album, I have a feeling this will be played on tour)                                  95.5 Rating out of 100  (Yes this album is that good)    As most Motorhead albums do it may take a couple listens to grow on you and for you to hear the songs as individual songs, once it does you'll agree with this rating.      If you want a kick a$$ album to own buy this and listen to some real music!!    Cheers everyone
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this to come out. I suddenly found it on Amazon and discovered I could watch it immediately, and it was Valentines Day!  Hurray that this film is such an accurate portrayal of two women falling in love. So well written and directed. Actors Traci and Necar were phenomenal together, excellent, raw, real acting and amazing chemistry... made you remember the first time you fell in love. Excellent sound track too. And it's a movie for anyone - it is a love story. I watched it twice in a row before my rental expired, waiting for the dvd now. Can't wait for the next production!
B002T9H2MO|2.0|I don't have any time or patience for numerous paragraphs of reviews - I leave that to the people who get paid to do it. And I usually start losing interest if it's just not brief and to the point upon reading. Anyway, I am an average consumer who loves horror and sci-fi. There are of course several horror and sci-fi movies that I, or others may not like - and this is one I did not like. Two stars for good acting and ok story otherwise it would have been one star. Yes, I watched the entire movie and followed it and got the picture. The interaction between man and machine was interesting and the story was deep. It unfortunately bored me after the first thirty minutes or so but I was determined to follow through with the movie. Then again, similar happened for me with the 2001 Space Odyssey movie. Yes, I think the movie appeared to be put together fairly well and I can understand how it grasped the attention of many. I am not here to critique people for what they like or do not like in movies. I am only here to share MY OPINION OF THE MOVIE and not to bash those who I may not have the same opinion with. People can read all of the many reviews here and other places and decide for themselves if they wish to see this movie based on the diversity of opinions.

0783229372|2.0|Just love everything about this movie.<br /><br />Robert Wise did a great job. Also, adapting one of the ideas around as the casue for the disaster and develop a movie around it was brilliant. Scott's performance is right on the spot, perfect.<br /><br />Technically, the movie is indeed very good, mainly if you consider when it was filmed (1975). The idea of merging real footage was also a winner.<br /><br />But (and that's a BIG BUT), I wonder who at Universal despised this movie so much as to give it this sh...t transference job to DVD or, apparently, to no no job transfer at all. Seldom have I seen such a bad image quality in a DVD from a movie that's not so particularly old. I was shocked when I saw all the grainy patches (and mt TV screen is just 32 inchs, not so big), the lack of any definition, well, a lot of people mentiond it here with more knowledge. It was a dissapointment.<br /><br />That's why the two stars review. Not for the movie, but for the DVD quality.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|As a huge fan of Daft Punk (probably my favourite band), I first saw this DVD several years ago and it never gets old. It is a combination of a phenominal album and high-budget anime at its finest.  The storyline, although simplistic, is easy to follow and the characterizations are superbe.   The attention to detail is second to none, as every scene is well developed and matches up to the soundtrack perfectly. I can't imagine anyone evry being dissapointed with this DVD.
B001W63DX2|3.0|Given teh great opportunity given the camera crew, this DVD dissapoints. It's indeed a little bit \\"shallow\\", in the sense that the guys really don't open themselves. But, this was not intended to be \\"SOME KIND OF MONSTER\\", so, in general, it achieves its goal: to give a brief glimpse of Iron Maiden on tour.<br /><br />Well, at least Samallwood admits that Janick Gers \\"never plays the same thing twice\\" and \\"the guys sometimes look at him and aks what are you doing?\\".<br /><br />It achieves its goal. But this goal simply do not interest me much.
B004AKCME8|3.0|These reviewers are more than likely company people for this production.     If the makers of this movie think anyone is going to spend about $2k on a 3D TV to see a DVD in 3D they must be nuts, cheap and greedy.    Those 3D glasses in the theaters work but a lot of time the movie doesn't work in 3D. Bought several DVDs in 3D that provided those flimsy paper glasses. The reproduction of 3D was very good with the cheap flimsy glasses at home. It it better than in the movies because a lot theaters really can not run 3D as it should be. Some movies that claimed to be 3D in the cinema were in fact never 3D movies.    America is supposedly in an economical down turn. Provide 3D glasses with the retail version of 3D movies. One has to be nuts to buy shutter glasses and a 3D TV. No one even goes to the movies nowadays.And huge numbers just pay for one movie and spend all night or all day at the cinema.    The reviewers never said a thing about 3D glasses or the lack of them. I got to assume they are professional writers who will say anything for a buck two.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Best vocals to date yet the suckiest and most bland sounding music ever.  What happened to the FUNK?!  I get that an artist can evolve and want to try different things, but it's not Country Rock or Soul if there is no funk.  What, does he hate drums now?      Rock & Roll Jesus was very different that his prior music but it still had soul - it still had funk - even though it should have been called the \\"I Still Love Pam\\" CD - but that's another story.      I hope the angry 16-year old with heart, soul & FUNK get back into his music.  Kid Rock is the ONLY thing on my iPod since I bought the History of Rock in 2000 - I've rollerbladed exclusively to Kid rock for 11 years now - taking 3-6 tunes from each CD.  Born Free was a waste of my time and money.  Bring back soul & funk and hurry man.
B003UESJH4|4.0|I don't typically go for Oscar bait centered on the British Aristocracy. It's not really my thing - too stuffy and self-important. Well, you can go ahead and throw that out the window because director Tom Hooper has delivered a crowd-pleaser if ever I've seen one. The story of King George VI and his determination to conquer his severe stammer, aided by his quirky speech therapist, Lionel Logue, is the feel-good film of the year. Brilliantly realized by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, both characters spring to life with the sort of enthusiasm that you can practically feel through the screen. While at first it may appear that this is yet another in a long line of stuffy aristocratic historical dramas, the truth is that The King's Speech is as much a comedy as anything. At the risk of losing what credibility I have, I dare to use one of the great clich&eacute;s--a triumph of the human spirit--because there really is no better way to describe the film and the feelings it arouses.<br /><br />The film opens with Albert George (Firth), the Duke of York (for he has not yet taken the throne), preparing to address the crowd before the 1925 Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium. His stammering speech has a visibly unsettling effect the listeners in attendance and we see this problem extend to his home life, where he struggles to tell his daughters a bedtime story. At the behest of his wife, Elizabeth (the excellent Helena Bonhom Carter), Albert begins taking lessons with a goofy speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Rush). It was around this time that the radio began to play a large part in the British monarchy, with the prospect of regular radio addresses looming in the near future. As King George V declines in health and eventually dies, the crown is passed to Albert's brother Edward (convincingly played by the great Guy Pearce); however it soon becomes clear that the hard-partying Edward has no interest in being King, and he eventually runs off to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, abdicating the throne and thrusting the responsibility to the understandably terrified Albert. Upon declaration of war with Germany, Albert, now King George VI, is given a three-page speech to read over the radio. This is the titular speech and serves as the culmination of a long struggle between Albert and Lionel. The journey these two men take to this famous moment is chronicled with tenderness, wit, and humor, transforming what could have been a rather dull and dreary story into an uplifting and wildly entertaining one.<br /><br />As mentioned above, the reason The King's Speech works so well resides with the two leads. Geoffrey Rush does what he always does, effortlessly imbuing the character with multiple layers and idiosyncrasies that culminate in a character that is both humorous and stern, believable and wonderful. It is the kind of performance that Rush is now know for, but that doesn't diminish its impact. As good as Rush is, Colin Firth is even better; building off of his fantastic work in last year's A Single Man, Firth tackles what may be the most difficult role of his career and comes up aces. He takes on the challenge, not only of portraying a king (with living relatives, as his daughter went on to become Queen Elizabeth II), but a king with a severe speech impediment. It's easy to imagine the role becoming grating for audiences, but it is a credit to Firth and director Tom Hooper that the film rises above what in hindsight seems a petty concern by resisting the urge to tone down the king's stammer. The struggle and consternation is plainly seen on Firth's face and the audience will empathize with him, regardless of their own speech habits. It is the crowning achievement of Colin Firth's career, and he will most certainly be rewarded by the Academy.<br /><br />With all of that said, I must confess that The King's Speech didn't take hold of me in the way that films like Black Swan, The Social Network, and The Fighter did. I chalk it up to my own personal viewing preferences, as there is nary a fault to be found in Tom Hooper's film. The King's Speech contains excellent performances (most notably by the two brilliant lead actors), sterling production values, assured direction, and a humorous and measured screenplay. It may sound like a simple story about one man helping another with his stammer, but the film somehow transcends its subject matter and stands as one of the better films of the year. 4.5 out of 5 stars.nces, as there is nary a fault to be found in Tom Hooper's film.

1594481717|5.0|In A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, author Daniel Pink details how we have moved from an agriculturally-based society to industrial, from industrial to informational, and now toward a more conceptually-based \\"right-brain\\" society. Historically, the business sector has favored left-brained people, while those whose brains favor the right hemisphere have not always \\"succeeded\\" materially according to the world's standards. Things are changing though. Hi-tech \\"left brain\\" businesses are moving overseas, computers are doing more and more things faster than people, and we are living in an ever more abundant and plentiful society. Therefore, we can all seek to develop holistic aptitudes which come from the brain's right hemisphere.<br /><br />I found Pink's book far more helpful than many of the so-called \\"ground-breaking\\" or \\"foundational\\" books he quoted(I read several of these recently, including Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence and Social Intelligence books, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Creativity). The main reason for my applauding Whole New Mind over these is because Pink offers lots of practical ways to apply each chapter's topic using the suggestions, exercises, web page resources, etc. which he sprinkles generously through-out the book. If I can't apply what I'm reading to my life or business, it's really of not much value, and Pink certainly passes the test!<br /><br />Most books have shortcomings and this one is no exception. For example, as I'm presently reading Plan B: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, I wonder if oncoming environmental collapse would arrest the process of movement to a conceptually-based society which Pink so optimistically anticipates. And as an ordained international Christian worker, I found the section on spirituality disappointing. However, if you listen to this audiobook and seek to apply those lessons which stick out to you to your own situation, you won't walk away unchanged! As for me, I'll be reading web blogs about design for the short-term future, checking out a stack of magazines I just bought which I would not ordinarily read, learning about labyrinths and laughing clubs (although probably not participating!), and maybe take a short course on drawing sometime in the next few years.g web blogs about design for the short-term future, checking out a stack of magazines I just bought which I would not ordinarily read, learning about labyrinths and laughing clubs (although probably not participating!), and maybe take a short course on drawing sometime in the next few years.

B0046IGOIO|5.0|Yet another very welcome official Doors release, yet another concert pulled from the vaults after decades.  This is the entire June 6, 1970 show recorded live at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver and spread across two discs.<br /><br />The show has long been available on bootleg, the best version being the One Hundred Minutes release on the Tuff Bites label from the mid-90s (which featured a caricature of bearded Morrison belting out a tune).  While this was a soundboard recording, it does not resemble the Absolutely Live releases.  It sounds like there were less mics, and is a bit muddier / flatter / tin-cannish (as opposed to the very crisp, very clear AL releases).  For instance, there's not much echo/resonance on Jim's voice or any of the instruments, and the crowd noise is lower, perhaps because this was a radio broadcast.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's a great show from start to finish.  Albert King joins the band on stage for four songs (all very blues-y), and this is definitely one of the best versions of Who Do You Love of all the live releases.<br /><br />This set comes in a slim digipack with scant liner notes and is highly recommended to Doors fans, as are pretty much all of the Bright Midnight entries.  The fanatics will buy it regardless, but new fans who want live material may prefer the crisper-sounding releases for Detroit or Philadelphia (both 1970).<br /><br />What's left?  Bootleg fanatics know there's a Seattle show from the previous day that featured a very drunk Morrison slurring his way through the set, playing with the microphone for the feedback effect, or not singing at all.  The band sounded great, and I expect that show will see the light of day soon.  Otherwise, there's the Isle of Wight show from August, 1970, which was one of their last and is available in excellent soundboard quality (and complete).  Otherwise...plenty of real \\"bootleg quality\\" material from audience recordings, and if the bands gets into releasing that in more quantity (they gave a taste with the Boot Yer Butt box), we will buying The Doors for a long, long time (again)...oot Yer Butt box), we will buying The Doors for a long, long time (again)...
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is a classic.  As others have said, it's right up there with Pride and Prejudice.  Fantastic screenplay and wonderful acting along with rich historical details and locations make this a delight to watch.  The accents are accurate (bad accents are a real pet peeve for me) making the characters more believable. The romance is subtle except for the somewhat \\"modern\\" ending, but really, would modern viewers be satisfied with an accurate 1850's ending?  This film is as historically true as possible while still being entertaining and romantic.  Love it!
0143038419|1.0|Ditto to all the one-star reviewers.  And the movie itself isn't even worthy enough to be labeled maudlin.  But what does the public want?  Bread and circuses.  It sells books.

B003ZHVJFA|4.0|This is a review of the blu-ray from WB Japan. It has yet to recieve an American release, which is a shame.    The movie itself is actually not bad. It's very unfortunate that not only did Crystal Sky (the studio) drop the ball in getting this film released, but the internet kids and their relentless complaints that this isn't faithful to the game. The game's storyline wouldn't work in a film! Get real. While Tekken does lack some other things from the game that could have been in the film (the Devil Gene), it actually works surprisingly well, despite some big flaws.     This film commenced production during the 2007-2008 WGA strike...and I think that could have hurt, because the story and script needed a little bit of polish. It starts off very well, but ends up extremely rushed by the second half of the movie. Also, many of the characters who do show up have little or nothing to do at all...especially the sexy Williams sisters. With all said, this movie isn't quite as bad as some say. The acting is surprisingly strong (especially Jon Foo and Ian Anthony Dale), and it has a pretty cool aesthetic look, despite the film's low to mid budget. Tekken's bumpy production history is a sad tale, as in the end, the film was really just setting the foundations for what could have been a rather cool franchise. I really hope people go out and support this flick when it finally has it's US release, because it's really quite above the average video game adaptation. Stay tuned until after the credits for a little surprise.    The blu-ray is decent enough, it has great audio and video, but it does lack on the extras. The extras are a lengthy on set Q&A with the film's crew and cast (minus director Dwight Little, and actors Jon Foo and Kelly Overton), an online theatrical release Q&A with Jon Foo, a seven minute behind the scenes look. You can find the same thing on the DVD, if you have a region free.      All in all, this is kinda worth it if you've been waiting for a Tekken movie,and aren't expecting total faithfulness. It's a darn good effort, but a little sad that it didn't get the budget or respect it deserves.
B000SFD21Q|3.0|Basically the same information you can get for free on the Sparkpeople.com website.  I didn't find this book particularly motivational.
B002GJT4Y6|3.0|The ultimate edition is sadly not worth the money. I was sorely disappointed. The two disk version is better. However, that does not have the deleted scenes, some of which were definitely worth deleting but others which added to the movie, such as the deleted scene with the Malfoys in the black magic shop near the beginning, and which should have been left in.  I was disappointed in the last two disks in the ultimate edition, with the added features such as commentary by the author, commentary by some of the actors on their characters, and so on. I found them very boring as they repeated stuff that was in the two disk versions of the various movies. The screen test of the three main characters was not nearly as interesting to watch as I thought it would be. The book was only a small book of pictures of scenes from the various HP movies, and there were two character cards. There is also a fifth disk, a downloadable copy, but it is expired already. That should have had no expiration date.  It would have been nicer to have bought just a two disk version and bought separately a larger picture book, a set of character cards, and the Harry Potter Kids Bio DVD for some background on how the main actors were chosen.   Personally, I prefer the two disk versions of the movies in widescreen over the ultimate editions. There are a great many HP accessories one can buy that I think one would be better off purchasing than these.
0439023521|5.0|This book exceeded all the expectations I had for it.  I was looking for another good book to read and hadn't been able to find much of anything.  I had heard this series was good and so I tried it.  I wasn't able to put this book down until I finished it.  The author really brings you into Katniss' world and makes you feel what she feels.  More than once I thought of what it would take to turn our world into theirs and how my life would play out if that happened.  Great great book and I recommend it to anyone.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Not your shallow, commercial pop-holiday album here.  This one's an awakening for soul and spirit, full of esoteric reminders of the true essence behind the celebration; that being the promise, labor and birth of Christ consciousness on the planet.  The appearance of The African Children's Choir and African drums on some songs brings the experience right back to the cradle of civilization.  A nice bonus is the included booklet containing Annie's message, the song lyrics and some very cool old-world visual art.  It's spirituality without religion, so listen with your entire being!
B0046UGSNS|1.0|After seeing the previews for this movie, I was looking forward to seeing family life with the female characters and their children. The children decide to seek out their father and the storyline looked promising. What it turned into was a sleazy affair between Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo---betrayal, hurt and lost relationships--too much of that already. Hollywood writers are stale and use sex because they have no imaginations. Zero stars--viewer beware.
0802130208|5.0|There is an infectious sinister joy to Ignatius Reilly. Love him or hate him, he's not easily forgotten, and that's the mark of an indelible character and a great writer. By the end of this madcap romp, the bittersweet reality concerning the author's pre-mature demise bleeds into your consciousness because it is apparent that there could have been further delicious adventures with Ignatius but there will be no more. Still, all things considered perhaps we are lucky that this one gem somehow found its readership.

0890090572|5.0|Doyle's dry humor offered up in limited nuggets via Watson's introductory narratives crack me up.<br /><br />\\"An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humours, would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.\\"  (The Musgrave Ritual).<br /><br />In this volume, it's easy to get your Victorian groove on because Paget's illustrations mimic the stories rather literally and the typeface/look from the Strand brings the whole experience home.  I hadn't read any of Holmes adventures in quite some time but Doyle's writing remains succinct and fun to read. A treat that's hard not to like.
B004LQI0HE|4.0|I enjoyed this beautiful film, gentle and horrible, great cinematography and music, well worth seeing, but I'll never accept the premise. SPOILER ALERT: My instincts tell me that every group would produce a few bad apples that would not march obediently off the cliff and they would spoil the whole barrel.<br /><br />While it is true that we shall all die, being treated like produce who exist merely for medical benefit of unseen strangers is bound to bring the survival instinct to bear.  That scream of rage would lead at the very least to avoidance behavior, which even a rat or flea will demonstrate.<br /><br />Still, we all face the inevitable fact of our impending doom whether it serves anyone else or not.  Its treament of that makes this a very worthy film
0439023521|5.0|Just read a few reviews of this amazing book, and was annoyed that in the first 3 I chose, they talk about what happens in the second and third books!  In one, they actually say what happens in the end of the last book!!!  I wish there was a button to submit spoiler reviews. So, I will talk only about what happens in the very beginning of the book, and hopefully you will be as enthralled as I, without learning too much in the review.  So, back to the topic at hand: Hunger Games.   I don't often find an immediate bond with a book, but the Hunger Games had me hooked on the very first page. Suzanne's Young Adult novel is rich with characterization, suspense, and imagery.  There is a very chaste romance, but nothing more than quick kisses make the grade.  The story begins with teenager Katniss Everdeen  having just returned home from hunting illegally.  In her town, called \\"District 12\\" (a division of North American towns sometime in the future), most of the residents are starving.  The meat, vegetables, fruits and herbs she trades on the black market keep her family fed- though just barely.  You learn early on, that there is an evil \\"big brother\\" type of government in another district that is punishing all other districts for rebelling, by keeping food supplies low, making trading obsolete, imprisoning the residents of each district in a walled off community, and forcing each district to draft one boy and one girl into a death match called the Hunger Games.    The way the boys and girls are chosen is through a raffle. Starting at the age of 12, every child's name is submitted, and each year after, their name is entered double the amount of times as the previous year.  If he or she chooses, each teen can submit their name extra times, receiving bonus supplies for each time their name has been submitted. Our heroine Kat, enters her name to gather these goods, which will allow her family to survive.   Soon, the book takes us to the center of town, where residents are nervously clutching their children and saying silent prayers that their names will not be called by the chirpy emcee. This year Kat's younger sister Primrose will be entered into the competition for the very first time. They know that the games pit 24 children against each other, in the woods far off in an unknown location, and televise the long, brutal death match to the entire \\"country\\".   The perception of these games differs greatly based upon who is watching.  The people of the districts wait in horror to see if the one child who survives the game above all others with be their own.  The rulers of the land find the sport ever so thrilling and eagerly await the games each year. Will Kat, Primrose or one of their close friends be called upon to be this year's \\"tribute\\"? Read and find out!!
B00007KWHP|5.0|Although I have always liked this album, I bought it when it first came out, I wish that for both Fragile and Close to the Edge, the additional tracks would not have been added. I like to remember the albums the way they were. The additional artwork is nice. Close to the Edge and Fragile are, in my opinion, their best albums; their talent came to its fruition with these albums. A must for any one's progressive rock collection.
B004N66XYE|5.0|I have not seen the earlier series but if, as many have said, it is better than this, I certainly plan to watch it. As such, I had no preconceived notions about what it should be but love British Period Drama and was not disappointed by this short series. It was interesting and adult-themed without being offensive. I look forward to the next season! Thank you, BBC!
B0045ODPKY|2.0|Sadly, I found this film only mildly entertaining.    Plot:  Angelina, as Evelyn Salt,  is an American spy working for the CIA.  When she is accused of being a Russian spy she starts running from the CIA.  While I liked the idea of the plot, I never really felt any sense of suspense.  Nor did I feel any edge of my seat concern for Angelina's physical well being--although I was concerned about the public's welfare when pursuing CIA agents were shooting through crowds of people and freeway traffic. And while it is not the reason for my 2-start rating, long before the movie ended, I figured which side Salt was really on.    Action scenes:  It was hard for me to believe that such a slightly built (thin) woman could do so much damage and stunt work and remain unscathed.  Example: Rolling over the wall of an overpass onto the roof of a semi and then leaping from there to a tanker with ease.  Except for the opening scene in Korea where skillful makeup makes her look realistically beaten up, Angelina never looks the worse for wear after her fight and action scenes--maybe a little blood, but few if any bruises and no limping or broken bones.  At one point in the film she removes her shoes and runs through the city and clings to a building ledge barefoot.  The skill with which she manages this, again without injury or noticeable pain, is not very realistic.     Angelina is a beautiful woman and I liked the idea of an attractive action character but a few of her physical attributes were distracting.  As another (maybe more) reviewer has mentioned, blond hair, or at least the particular shade chosen, does not suit Angelina's coloring. She looked washed out.  Later, she disguises herself by dyeing her hair black, and becomes the beautiful Angelina we all know.  It would have been more acceptable to have turned the disguise around. There would then have been a reason for the unnatural blond hair (it's a disguise!).  I also found Angelina's pouty lips distracting on more than oneoccasion.  If her lips are natural, I apologize, but if not, Angelina needs to cut back on the injections.    Fantasy Action Thriller?  I tried to suspend my disbelief and view this movie as an Arnold Schwarzenegger over the top comic book type film (which this film was not supposed to be). Could not do it.    In some ways I liked the movie, but I only gave it two stars because it was not possible for me to get \\"lost\\" in the plot and action.  There where just too many questionable film details that got in the way.  The idea of a female action figure to counter all the films with male action figures is admirable.  But, rather than creating a female version of a male action film, I would like to see Hollywood develop a distinctive female action style that takes into account the difference in body builds.
B00006FM77|5.0|The Bonus disk is so good that they could have sold that by itself (South California Purples, Sing A Mean Tune Kid, and 25 Or 6 To 4 rock the house)!  I remember buying this album after it was released back in 1972.  This music is classic, and Terry Kath was easily the best guitarist of his generation (besides Jimi Hendrix, of course).  Danny Seraphine is one of the best rock and roll drummers of all time!  And the rest of the band is so good, that most bands can't even compare (especially with a horn section like Chicago's)!  Buy this 4-CD set now!  You won't regret it!  Every single song on here is off-the-hook!!  What other band could release 3-double albums to start off their career, and then the \\"Live\\" compilation after that?  Just absolutely incredible!!

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Wonderful series but to really understand what is happening you should read all 5 books in order.  Even then it may be difficult to follow at times...good reason to read it again!  I can easily say its one of my favorite series next to Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire Series, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files and J Frost's Cat and Bones \\"One Foot in Grave\\" series.  Even though it is more about fae than vampires,  I loved it.  The mystery about who/what is Barrons and the chemistry between Mac and Barrons, along with all the action and Karen's \\"quotes\\" made it a wonderful series to me.  The quote about \\"time heals...No it doesn't\\" really hit home.

1904550665|5.0|My little grandson loves the rhyming sounds of this book and the music of the cd.  He has loved these sounds since he was 3-4 months old and is now a year old so it is familiar to him.  The book is wee made and will hold up for a long time in little hands.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|When I listen these amazing songs I remember my far sweet childhood and youth in 70-th of the last century....  The Beatles were our idols. But me pleases that my children (born in 90th) also enjoy listening this disk.   Recently I've ordered three more disks and I'm waiting receive them with impatience.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This is the movie that all the fans were waiting for since the game, too shame that we got first \\"The spirit within\\" (don't take me wrong, the movie is fine, but not THIS fine). Special thanks to the new scenes. This is a movie for the fans of the saga and everyone else.
B0019GJ4EC|3.0|The Blu Ray copy of this is very good, but the movie is not as good as I remember. It is alright, but not at all scary and most of the effects are not much better than standard Zombie movies. Parts of the movie don't really make any sense, but there you go.     Unless you are a collector of this sort of movie there really isn't much reason to spend you money on it; at least I wish I hadn't. Maybe I'll give it to someone as a present.

1594488878|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much right up until it ended... I must have missed an important piece (I was listening to the audio production) since I have no idea what the website reviews at the end were pointing out. Was there another Tucker Crowe album we hadn't known about? Was Annie with him? I'm confused.
0316098337|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time and I just said that 2 days ago about Perfect Peace. :)  This book is so intriguing and suspensful the first half and then heart wrenching and makes you want to protect this little guy in the world.    It reminded me of what Jaycee Duggard must have been thru and her children once they were found!    I couldn't put it down, I read it straight for 4 hours......my eyes are tired! But it was worth it!
0736092269|5.0|Excellent information and drawings! Having suffered a herniated disc (C-7) and years later (L-4/5), it is refreshing to find a sports trainer who takes these issues into consideration and provides guidance on how you can still work out without endangering already existing problem areas.  Clear drawings of muscle groups, how they attach to which bones, and what outcomes you can expect from targeting specific areas.  Very pleased with info. Wish more trainers would think like this when teaching athletics.  Recommend highly if you really want to understand your body!
B000003TA4|4.0|I had just graduated college when this CD was released.    I worked at the radion station there, when their previous album, Bleach, came out.    I wasn't impressed.       Man, was I ready for something, some new band, some new album to drop, to act as a grenade in regards to popular music at the time.    Nevermind, and Pearl Jam's debut did a fine job of it.         This CD, simply... rocked.      Harder and with more emotion and less hair product than anything on the radio before it. Anger, longing, feelings of disenfranchisement... this was good stuff!    Buh Bye hair metal ballads, hello.... music like I was listening to in basement clubs already.       And I rejoiced.   For a bit.     Then the hyperbole started. \\"Grunge\\" became \\"fashionable\\" and   Kurt Cobain's the voice of a generation.... wtf?       One solid album and he's the voice of a generation?       Which in turned begged the question, what generation?  I was 21 years old, and apparently too old for this album to speak on my behalf.  It became silly.  Which became annoying, which in turn soured me toward the album.  Which wasn't fair at the time, but I got over it eventually....    If Nevermind had been the first in a series of great albums, spanning years, showing musical growth, I would have been delighted.     But it wasn't.  It was a one-off, a really good record by a band that made a handful of mediocre ones and disbanded because the lead singer had mental problems and addictions, and didn't have the tools nor support he needed to deal with them as an adult.     Nevermind was wonderful, sloppy rock and roll noise, with tonsil shredding vocals that all mixed together to really, really work.       Cut out the drama, the hype and the sad tale of Cobain, and thats what it boils down to.    Favorite tracks:   Polly, Come As You Are, Territorial Pissing
B003YBNREI|5.0|Original Doobie Brothers frontmen Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmonds have reunited with producer Ted Templeman, who produced those 4 classic 1972-76 Doobie Brothers albums (Toulouse Street, Captain & Me, What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits and Stampede) that got so many of us hooked on the Doobies back then.<br /><br />There's some great music on this CD. If you liked those classic 1970s Doobies albums with Tom Johnston in the band (before Micheal MacDonald came on the scene)you'll like this one.
B00406UK7S|3.0|THis movie was interesting, for what is basically a chase film.  There is plenty of action,drama and suspense.  Michael Fassbender is good as usual (he was great in Inglourious Basterds).  The movie does suffer from bad editing and directing.  It comes across as a TNT or Spike produced type movie.  It is watchable but you will find yourself thinking it could have been better.
B000E6EJAC|5.0|Mott The Hoople had released a few albums prior to this 1972 album but All The Young Dudes was their break out album.<br /><br />Highlights include covers of Lou Reed's \\"Sweet Jane\\" and David Bowie's \\"All The Young Dudes\\" along with band leader Ian Hunter's composition \\"One Of The Boys\\". David Bowie also performed on \\"All The Young Dudes\\" and handled some of the production on this album.<br /><br />For those of you who are just discovering 1970s music, this is one of the essential early 70s albums you should check out. With the release of this album, Mott The Hoople became one of the top glam rock acts during 1972-74.<br /><br />Frontman Ian Hunter began a successful solo career in 1975. He's still releasing new material. Mott's lead guitarist on this album was Mick Ralphs, who left to become an original member of Bad Company in 1974.

0743297334|4.0|I decided to revisit this classic after reading The Paris Wife, which gives witness to Hemingway's inspiration for and creation of The Sun Also Rises.  I enjoyed reading it in college and wanted to re-experience it as a more mature reader. Knowing more about Hemingway's life made me want to explore some of the autobiographical elements of the novel.<br /><br />Reading this book made me want to drink!  I was amazed at how much was consumed, and Jake Barnes and his friends could turn their drunkenness on and off like a switch.  They often used their \\"tightness\\" as an excuse for their unsavory behavior.  The banter was somewhat redundant, but the bullfighting scenes were exciting.  Hemingway really captured the atmosphere of Spain and Fiesta.  He also illustrated the tension and combativeness of Jake's group, specifically between Robert Cohn and Brett and Mike.  The moral ambiguity is at the heart of this book and it is an enduring commentary on the \\"lost generation.\\"
0307266303|5.0|If you are like me than the title to my review is a unreal proposition due to the speed at which I can read. I will tell you though if I could have read it without stopping I would have. I certainly wanted to. I found this book to be inspirational, funny, informative, and eye opening.<br /><br />Anyone who can write about running for more than a hundred miles and inspire a person who does not run (me) to claim that as a new goal is inspirational. Luckily my wife is always there to reel me back into reality. I felt a certain romance while reading about running through the night, lonely and tired, battling your mind which is rationally telling you to quit. The author did a fabulous job of describing the anguish athletes must feel in situations similar to the races he writes about.<br /><br />The host of characters is as good in this book as any fiction book I have ever read. At times I could feel the awkwardness between Barefoot ted and Caballo Blanco as if I were there, or the frustration with the younger kids getting to wasted and possibly ruining the trip for others. Yet he describes a common love they all have for each other, a bond as strong as they come and only knowing each other a few days. It is truly beautiful.<br /><br />Finally I learned a great deal from this book. I will share my favorite bit of knowledge and hopefully a few of you will have the same sense of joy I got after reading it. I have wondered since the first time I saw Vibrams Five finger shoes how they got so popular all of a sudden. The plug in this book I believe is what turned the sales on for the company. Thankfully, because they are Great shoes.

B003OF3R0S|4.0|\\"Nightmare\\" is the fifth studio album by American metal band \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" released in 2010. \\"Nightmare\\" was my introduction to the music of the band, and I have to say left a very positive impression.  The line up features lead singer M. Shadows, guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates along with bassist Johnny Christ; on \\"Nightmare\\" drums are performed drum-innovator Mike Portnoy baring the duties of deceased drummer The Rev.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare\\" turned out to be a very interesting, at times intriguing, listen due to its musical direction; it would not be an exaggeration to claim that \\"...Sevenfold\\" combine elements of thrash metal, melodic metal, hard rock and AOR, this being the formula for most songs on \\"Nightmare\\". For that matter, the heavier songs open on a thrash-y rhythm, followed by impressive guitar melodies and aggressive vocals concluding in a subtle, almost AOR-like melodic chorus. And this is the brilliance of the album, being able to balance all the musical elements mentioned above effectively crafting memorable and relevant metal songs.<br /><br />Still, one would have preferred that the album included more songs of the type mentioned above as four out of the eleven songs are actually slower, at times acoustic/ballad while perhaps one or two such tunes would have been enough. Above all, the material on \\"Nightmare\\" can be characterized as lengthy, aggressive and melodic a combination that grants the release artistic depth while managing to engage the listener for quite some time in order to uncover all the musical twist and turns of \\"Nightmare\\".
0316067598|5.0|I personally thought this account of the navy seals was great.  If you're not a military buff, this book is easy to follow.

B004BLJQOK|1.0|Honestly, I should have learned years ago to not listen when Stephen King says something is 'the best' of anything. This movie was actually given 3 stars?!? This was the biggest disappointment since The Orhpan. Your money will be much better spent on something else.
0525423273|5.0|I picked up Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins yesterday when I was out with friends.  I decided I would read little last night before bed. Well it seems my idea of \\"a little\\" is really all 372 pages. I couldn't put it down until I KNEW how it ended, even as my eyes felt bleary and tired at 3:30 in the morning, I couldn't put it down.  I am not sure I can adequately explain in words how much I LOVED this book. Part of my adoration stems from my connection to the book. I remember the first time I traveled abroad at 18. I went to a country that didn't speak English and it was challenging to say the least. But more relatable was the way in which Etienne, the English boy, is described. I know that English boy right down to the bad habit of chewing his finger nails.    OK enough about that to the actual review part! A couple of my friends had read ARCs of Anna so I knew I would probably like but it is so much more than liking or even loving it. You know the first time you read something and as you're reading you are no longer just sitting somewhere with the book in your hands but so completely in the story you forget yourself, that is Anna and the French Kiss.  Stephanie Perkins does an amazing job of weaving what it is like to be in a foreign place, how scary it can be to make new friends, but most all how confusing love can be altogether for one truly beautiful story. I think anyone who reads this book will find a piece of themselves in it.  Anna and her friends aren't fake or contrived and that also makes the book so special, I didn't feel like I was reading stereotypical characters.  The story moves quickly and all to soon it's over.  Every experience Anna has you experience as the reader. Her first time seeing Paris is written so well I feel like I was there too.   I wanted to write this review before I head out Christmas shopping with my sister.  Yes she is totally crazy and is dragging me with her, again. The reason I wanted to talk about the book is because it needs to be added to everyone's holiday shopping list. Buy it for yourself, buy it for your friends but trust me this isn't one you want to miss.  I will admit part of me didn't want to share the book with anyone. Again it is that feeling of reading a book and loving it so much it you just want it to be yours for a little while. You want to bask in the glow of how it makes you feel but I just couldn't stop thinking about it so I wrote the review to share with all of you.
0061120073|4.0|Overall the book is a worthwhile read, especially if you are interested in beautifully presented American history.  The main character, Francie, born at the beginning of the twentieth century, shares the story of her Brooklyn childhood in vivid and realistic detail.  You can just tell, from reading this work, that the main character bore more than a hefty overlap with the author.  The book is just too emotionally connected and detailed to be anything else.  This is a book that is strongly, perhaps almost entirely, character driven -- and the sympathetic nature of the main character is what makes the book so endearing.  I admit, I was sad when it ended.  I would have kept on reading this fictional girl's life story -- probably to her death.  I had a grandmother born less than ten years after Francie, and although I spent a lot of time with my grandmother over the 35 years I knew her, I feel I knew Francie better.  To me, this speaks volumes about the author's gift.<br /><br />I did, however, have a few gripes.  Allow me to list them.<br /><br />1) At times some of the characters or scenarios came across as cheesy.  For instance, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) kept naming her new husbands John, regardless of their real names, it quickly got old, especially when the author reminded us of the renaming about ten times.  Although this book detail may have been based on a real character, and probably was, to me it failed to translate well into the novel.<br /><br />2) There were some internal inconsistencies in the book, and that is a pet peeve of mine.  For instance, on page 42 (first paragraph of chapter 5) the narrator tells about Sissy having given birth to ten children who all died shortly after birth.  Then, on page 64-65 (a few pages into chapter 7), the narrator tells about Sissy's first child having been stillborn (as opposed to dying after birth), and the following three born dead as well.  So which was it?  Although you might consider me picky, a good editor wouldn't, and nor would a young mother who just lost her baby -- a stillbirth and a baby who lived an hour or two and then died are profoundly different things.<br /><br />3) Too much idealization of Francie's rotten parents.  Yes, there was some criticism of them, but almost all of it, even from the author's perspective, was couched in a parent-protecting attitude.  I personally felt enraged when Francie's mother put Francie to work and sent the younger brother to high school -- while she herself popped out another baby by her loser, alcoholic non-father of a husband, who, incidentally, had just died.  I get tired of narrators or authors who side too much with awful parents.<br /><br />4) The author had a sort of proto-feminist attitude that too often (to tie it in with my last criticism) equated to siding with women who displayed awful or very disappointing behavior.<br /><br />And one final point, not exactly a criticism:  I was surprised the book never mentioned that the hardy \\"tree of heaven,\\" upon which this book was based, and to which the main character was compared, actually has a horrible odor.  If you crush one of its leaves in your hand you'll find this out quickly.  The fact that this was never mentioned suggested to me that the author didn't know this tree as well as she might have let on.  I used to love these trees for all the reasons the author did mention, until I actually smelled one.  Hard to idealize them then.<br /><br />But all this said, overall still a powerful book -- brought to life an important time and place in such a special way.g mother who just lost her baby -- a stillbirth and a baby who lived an hour or two and then died are profoundly different things.    3) Too much idealization of Francie's rotten parents.

0061726826|5.0|Delirium is a fantastic read. Lauren Oliver builds a dystopian world around something everyone can understand LOVE.  Boys and girls are kept separate for fear they will catch the deliria before they can be cured.  An electric fence separates the cities from the wilds, a place where uncureds live.  Raids are conducted randomly to assure no one is breaking the rules and if you are thought to be a sympathizer you are dealt with.  All of these are done to prevent love, to protect the human race.        Oliver incorporates situations that evoke strong emotion and pull a reader completely into the story.  We see the world through Lena's eyes, who has seen enough of the harm that love can do.  She wants nothing more than to be cured.  Lena strives to be obedient and live life undetected, something her mother couldn't achieve.  Lena's life is progressing just as she wants until she meets Alex but the handsome boy is cured, so he has to be safe.  As her friendship grows with Alex a series of events could change Lena forever.        There are so many beautiful moments in this story it is hard to pinpoint what I loved the most.  The scene when Lena is being interviewed by the examiner's sheds some light on how society judges people and one wrong answer such has having a favorite color of gray, could destroy your chances of a good future.  Another thing that stood out for me was the at the beginning of each chapter were excerpts from history talking about amor deliria nervosa.  These added pieces of information craft a truly frightening back story to the world Oliver has created.  The pieces are clearly propaganda instilling fear and destroying the very notion of love completely.        This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I am not typically a fan of dystopian novels but this one  is so beautifully written and the concept is truly unique.  This is a must read for 2011.
B0000YEEHG|4.0|I can see why this movie is a classic.  I chose to watch it because I found it on a list of some of the world's top movies.  I can't say that I was disappointed, though I did find the story weird, and sometimes, to be honest, I couldn't figure out what was going on.  But still, the psychological depth of the movie kept me riveted, and kept me wondering what was going to happen.  And even if I was lost and confused at times, the tension remained so great throughout that I kept watching.<br /><br />A few weaknesses, though, got under my skin.<br /><br />Although the film was psychologically deep, I didn't feel the character of the actress totally added up, and I think the director intended this.  But personally this troubled me.  She was portrayed as both sane and insane at the same time in a way that I (as a therapist who worked with many people labeled with psychosis) didn't find believable.<br /><br />The other thing that got to me was the sexual perversity.  I felt it was a bit overdone -- and unnecessary.  But again, maybe that's just my personal thing.  Maybe it really was intrinsic to the movie.
1439153663|3.0|I've still got 1/4 of the book to complete but I must admit it's slow going. The plot is good, the characters are quite interesting, but the writing leaves me flat. I'm not a fan of first person writing, so maybe that's it; or maybe it's the lack of intensity and a very monotone prose. Therefore, I have no expectations of enjoying the remainder of the book any more than I have thus far.

6305907145|2.0|I was sadly disappointed in this interpretation of the book. First of all, Fannie, both the young and older Fannie are not at all portrayed as they are in Jane's book. You expect her to be shy, timid, afraid and then grow stronger. She is never once portrayed as that, she cries a little bit as a child when she first gets there and once when Mrs. Norris sends her on an errand. Mrs. Norris who plays such an integral part in making Fannie unhappy in the book, is only displayed making comments to Fannie in one scene that causes her embarrassment, she is not a primary character at all. I was also disappointed that Mansfield was not shown as the luxurious home that Jane described it as, it is large, but very plain. Sir Thomas is portrayed as almost creepy with the portrayals of activities in Antigua portrayed in Tom's journal. Lady Bertram and Edmund I feel were correctly portrayed, I thought the character of Edmund was played beautifully and true to Jane's description.     On a more positive note, the sisters, Mary, and Henry were very acceptable, but taking the importance of William completely out of the story was a great loss because it was integral in portraying to Henry and Sir Thomas the side of Fannie they had never seen before. Mary was played beautifully and I believe quite the character Jane described.     All in all, I hope to someday find a portrayal of Mansfield Park that will satisfy Austen purists, but sadly this is not it.

B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I bought this for my husband because he loved Band Of Brothers.... but this is not as good or as \\"clean\\". Band Of Brothers is a much better pick with a whole lot more actual war interaction.  Also there is male and female nudity, both could be done without... not needed! Actually ruins the short amount of time they have for plot  : \
B002ZG99TA|1.0|Good acting, great cinematography, worst story line ever! There's not a whole lot you can do with a run away train movie. Everyone but Denzel in this movie is portrayed as moronic ineptitudes. The new guy that never held down a job, can't count how many cars they're pulling, makes every wrong move, ends up a hero. Denzel works the two levers that control a train really good. Helicopters escort the train thru the whole movie but can't land a driver on it. Stupity runs rampant as sheriffs deputies mishandle everthing, and cause crash scenes. Someone should blacklist the writer and put him out of our misery!
B004EAQNO4|3.0|I think M. Night should stick to writing movies, and let someone else direct them. This was much better than his last movie, and the concept is good. Easily figured out, and there is lots of foreshadowing...lots. Some questionable moments throughout, but a decent horror movie.

030746363X|5.0|This book is absolutely terrific!  All of the tricks and topics he touches on are backed by science.  If they are not, it is researched and thoroughly reviewed by himself or experts in the field.  I couldn't put the book down, and wanted to try everything he wrote down.  It has funny passages and clever stories to make the book extremely entertaining as well and informative. I did a body composition test on myself a few months ago, and recently did another one.  In those couple of months, I gained 10Lbs of lean body mass and lost about 4-5% body fat!  Just by implementing some of his tricks.  It was like pressing the easy button!  I am at 7% body fat, which I have never done previously.  So all I did was workout less, relax and sleep more, eat ungodly amounts of organic whole foods, mix in some of his slow carb diet strategies, with the fat burn tips, and my body did the rest.  Before this book, when I dieted very hard, 8 months ago, and lost down to 165lbs at 6'2\\", I still had 11% body fat and was extremely miserable. The only thing that I could find wrong, is the unorthodox methods used by him, in this book, may not be used by closed minded, mentally weak people.  You have to have an open mind and be willing to try the methods used or nothing will happen.  I found one of the fat burning strategies to be extremely effective and uncomfortable at times, but when my body composition says 7% body fat, it makes it much easier and I know that what I have been doing is all worth the effort.
B002V1I3PK|3.0|The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is a great book, but this version is written a tad bit too archaically.  I would suggest purchasing another version, one which does not need to be deciphered line by line so much.
0061726826|5.0|Do you like YA?  Do you like suspense?  Do you like a good story with great characters?  Do you like dystopia?  If you like ANY or all of these, this is a book that you will enjoy.<br /><br />Imagine a world where love is defined as an illness (amor deliria nervosa), and as soon as you turn 18, you are given the \\"cure\\".  They haven't yet found a way to make it safe for those under 18, but they are working on it.  Imagine that your life partner is picked for you, and that the only reason parents take care of their children is out of a sense of obligation and duty.  There's no joy and true laughter once you receive the cure, and those who don't take to the cure, or who refuse the cure disappear and/or kill themselves.  The only music and literature that you hear and read is that which is approved by the government.  No Elizabeth Barrett Browning or the like, but you can always read The Book of Shhh (The Safety, Health, and Happiness Handbook).<br /><br />Now imagine that yo are almost 18, and can't wait to receive the cure.  Your mother killed herself because of the disease, and you and your sister were looked at with sideways glances, as if deliria might somehow be contagious.  You have memories of your mother covering up the windows to play music and dance with your sister and you, and you remember those as happy times.  But now you are ashamed; and you're also worried that your mother's illness will come down to you, and you are looking forward to the cure.<br /><br />Then you meet a golden boy, and he is fun, and he makes you laugh, and even though you know you shouldn't, you find yourself falling in love ... in love ... and the time for your cure is looming ever nearer.<br /><br />Delirium is the type of book that you want to read in one sitting.  Although I wasn't able to, Not-So-Bebe-Girl Autumn locked herself up in her room and pretty much read it in one sitting herself.  We both liked it a lot; I'd even go so far as to say that she LOVED it (I was pretty close to loving it myself).  We both agree that this would make a great movie, as long as the scriptwriter sticks to the book itself and doesn't try to add or delete from what is already a story certain to draw interest.<br /><br />It's not explicit, which makes it a great book even for the younger YA set, which I love.<br /><br />QUOTES<br /><br />Several years ago on the day of her procedure, one girl managed to slip from her restraints and find her way to the laboratory roof.

There were a lot of really cool parts and the storytelling is high quality. At first I was hesitant because it's kind of a different approach to telling this story, but it worked out really well being told the story from the perspective of all these people and it was just really cool to see somewhat realistic view of what might actually happen if zombies existed.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|If you don't like this, you're obviously a result of bad genetics.  Your parents were relatives, and God f'd up your eardrums in vengeance.  Audibly-speaking, you can't tell a plate of goose-turds from a bowl of foie gras.  You fool.  This is not only a good album.  It's foie-gras for your ears.  Spoon that stuff in there, buddy.  It's good!  If you don't like it at first, wait a while.  Listen again, this time carefully.  If you still don't like it, I'm sorry, but you're most- likely inbred.  I feel for you.  I'm sure a cure of some kind is on the way. Enjoy the new Black Eyed Peas album in the meantime!  Sorry!
0385340567|2.0|I love the Reacher series.  I actually couldn't put the book down even though it was weak in ways that have been covered by many other reviews.  My comment is that Jack Reacher, the man who takes on bullies and bashes them, suggested that the war in Iraq had nothing to do with taking on bullies and only had to do with politics.  Maybe Childs has lived in New York for too long;  read nothing but the Times;  and fell for the propaganda that Bush LIED or was after oil or was avenging his father - rather than Bush's rather Reacher-like, pre-emptive, somewhat illegal taking out of a man who ran rape chambers, used poison gas, invaded his neighboring country and did everything he could to obtain WMD.  Saddam is EXACTLY the kind of fiendish bully Reacher takes on.    The Irony!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I have always thought that Horror movies could be art, and go beyond the tropes that they generally find themselves in.  This movie was able to be eerie and satisfying to the horror movie lover in me, but at the same time, I have shown this movie to people who do not generally like horror movies.  I think what seperates this movie from others is though it does have gore, jump effects and a generally nihlistic point of view, it does not rely on them, but rather, it uses all of the tools at its disposal.  The focus of the story is on a child who goes through some of the worst bullying  ever seen on film without every seeming to go overboard.  I believed the problems the protaganist was having both at school and at home with his mother going through a divorce.  He meets someone as he sits out by the playground outside of his apartment complex at night.  They talk as too people that may be the most lonely and in need of a friend relationship I have ever seen that transends the ages they both appear to be.  There are murders going on in the background.  There seems to be a focus on the animalistic qualities of man eating each other, and just how bleak our day to day existance is, and the glimmer of hope is seen between the two children and a group at a bar, that seem to discount civilized morals, in favor of a more pride mentality of taking care of only the group at any cost.  You can also see this in a group of children who act as the tormentors to the protaganist.  I want to add that one of my favorite parts of the book is the revelation that the little girl is really a little boy.  There are small references that indicate that she is not a girl, and it was assumed by me that it was a reference to her vampire nature, when really it is a reference to her having a crude sex change operation and sold into prostitution, and though we may think we have become more civilized, but we really haven't.  The question is not whether violence is justified, by what justifies it.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This movie makes you feel young again. The bootleg cut was the first way I had viewed the movie, and the extra footage makes it entirely different. So, if you love 70's rock, always wanted to tour with a band, or just love free spirts, this is the movie for you.
B0030A0ZD4|4.0|I was on the fence about buying Moonwalker on Blu-Ray at first. I remember renting the VHS tape when I was 6 years old, staring up at the fuzzy image in my parents' bedroom and getting up to sing and dance along to Smooth Criminal. As with most things Michael did, it was magic! But would it still have the same impact today?<br /><br />Here's a quick rundown of the movie:<br /><br />-It starts with a montage of live performances of \\"Man In The Mirror.\\" As you'd expect, the arenas were PACKED with people, and a good number of them cried or fainted during the song. There's also footage of historical figures such as Gandhi and JFK, as well as starving children getting food and medicine, and Michael's charity work. Powerful stuff.<br /><br />-Next is a retrospective of MJ's career to that point, from the Jackson 5 years to his Bad album. Most of the songs/videos only play for 30 seconds or so, and the transitions are sometimes abrupt, but it's still a well-packaged look at the first half (!) of his career.<br /><br />-When the montage gets to the Bad era, it transitions into Badder, which is the Bad video performed by children. It's fun to watch, but sadly doesn't include the whole song, and I wish the original video was included on the disc. Actually, that's my major complaint about Moonwalker - that it doesn't include full-length videos for Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, etc...only short clips that leave you wanting more. There ARE three full-length videos in the movie (as well as a sort of \\"bonus\\" video at the end); those and the main feature sort of make up for it.<br /><br />-The first video is Speed Demon. It's a mostly claymation piece that features Michael getting chased by crazed fans and paparazzi. He dons a rabbit head and zooms out on a motorcycle and other vehicles, only to get a ticket himself at the end. It's a bit crude-looking at times, but it's still hilarious and a marvel of the animators' skill (in a time before CGI made animation easy).<br /><br />-The next video is also really creative: Leave Me Alone. The song is about a girl who broke MJ's heart and won't give him peace, but he reapplied the lyrics to all the tabloid stories and rumors about him for the video. The video has him flying around an amusement park which includes exotic animals, the elephant man and his monkey Bubbles. At the end, we find out the park is built around Michael, and he breaks free from it. The video won a Grammy for Breakthrough Animated Video.<br /><br />-Now we have the main feature of Moonwalker, Smooth Criminal. At 40 minutes long and with special effects that still look incredible, it's more a mini-movie than a music video. Basically, Michael and three kids find out about a drug lord (evil Joe Pesci!)operating in an underground lair. We move to a 1930's-style city, where Michael has the power to wish on a shooting star and turn into various vehicles in order to get away from/fight the bad guys. In the middle of the video, he walks into a nightclub and performs Smooth Criminal, and wow, it still blows me away today how great it is. From the time he flips the coin into the jukebox to his machine-gunning exit, it's pure excitement! Thanks to the HD presentation, it's even better than I remember, as you can see all the dancers and musicians in the background as they move to the beat. The Blu-Ray is missing a couple things here* but it's not a big deal.<br /><br />-At the end of Smooth Criminal, Michael comes back to the kids and leads them backstage to his performance of Come Together. This \\"live\\" performance is a nice bookend to the video, though I wonder why he chose that particular song.<br /><br />-The end credits include behind-the-scenes clips while a vocal group sings The Moon Is Walking, followed by the sped-up/blurred music video for Smooth Criminal (the album version).<br /><br />I mentioned that Smooth Criminal is missing a couple things:<br />1. At the end of the song part (before he pulls out the machine gun), Michael counts down his steps, spins around and points at the roof. On the Blu-Ray, the music keeps playing, but the vocals for his countdown and \\"BOW!\\" at the end are missing.<br />2. After he leaves the nightclub, there's a couple seconds cut off just as he meets the boys again and learns little Katie is missing.<br />3. As another reviewer pointed out, a couple seconds are missing where Frankie Lideo (Pesci) threatens to inject Katie with drugs.<br /><br />Those omissions, as well as the missing opportunity to add bonus videos from Bad, or retrospectives, or even a fan commentary, bring down the disc a bit (the trailer is included, but it hasn't been cleaned up at all). There are also a couple film scratches and marks here and there which could have been removed. Overall though, I'd say it's worth the upgrade to see Moonwalker in high definition. It's more proof (as if you need any!) that Michael Jackson was the greatest entertainer in the world.ounts down his steps, spins around and points at the roof.

B0035W8QUQ|5.0|For those fascinated by the obscure works occasionally unearthed from the history of music this 'musical happening' will surely appeal.  This recording is a mixture of works by the 17th century composers Giovanni Felice Sances (1600 - 1679) and Tarquinio Merula (1594-1665) as well as folk music from Italy and Corsica.  The combination is tied together with the theme of 'The Way of the Cross' by Christina Pluhar, a lutenist and harpist, who has gathered friends with period instruments into a group known as L'Arpeggiata.  In this recording the male quartet of singers known as Barbara Furtura joins L'Arpeggiata in mixing the 'serious music' with the 'people's music' and the result is fascinating and transporting.   The major works in this collection are Sance's extraordinary Stabat Mater and Merula's 'Hor ch'e tempo di dormire' in which the Virgin Mary lulls her baby to sleep while weeping for his future suffering and both enthrall the listener with a basso ostinato and hypnotic swaying rhythms.      In addition to the separate instrumental works and the works such as the hauntingly beautiful 'Maria (Sopra La Carpinese) sung by Barbara Fortuna end ensemble, there are wroks that incorporate the entire instrumental, 'choral' ensembles with soloists.  And to emphasize the importance of this recoding the soloists are French countertenor Philippe Jaroussky and Spanish soprano Nuria Rial.  The results are works that are at once deeply spiritual as marvelously passionate.  This is a sound that changes with every track in a way that challenges the listener to hear the variations in mood and technique while falling under the spell of this otherworldly music making.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 11

B003L77GG0|4.0|Rather like the make-it-up-as-you-go-along shows \\"The X-Files,\\" and \\"Lost,\\" it's obvious that the \\"Smallville\\" creators never expected this series to last more than a couple of seasons at best.  By season 10 Smallville and the Kent farm are not much more than a place to feed the dog and stare out toward the heavens from the hay loft of the barn.  From the beginning the series made the bold (and not necessarily wise) decision to discount the existing Superman myth and create a soap opera that would focus on entertaining young teens.  Once it was clear that this excursion would have little (or nothing) to do with the comic book character, I just went along for the ride, finding some episodes worthwhile and others close to embarrassing.  We find strange, distorted personifications of the Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Supergirl, select members of the JLA, etc., with the stitching for all frayed and generally disappointing.  Like so many other successful programs, \\"Smallville\\" did its best to fill the unexpected void opened up to the producers, cast, crew and scriptwriters.  Sometimes I really wanted to shame the writers for their staggering lack of imagination and reliance on older, staid sci fi material.  Since the series cowered away from turning Kal El into the ultimate superhero for years, we were always left with a kind of quasi-Superman, emotionally unbalanced, unfocused, and ignorant of his role as a self-sacrificing hero.  On balance, I credit the cast that so often made the totally ridiculous into something palatable.

030726999X|4.0|Blomkvist, Lisbeth and the gang are back! After Lisbeth is shot, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's nest starts with her in the hospital and in deep legal trouble as those who have been in successful in derailing her life in the past conspire to do so again. Will Blomkvist be able to battle corruption and save her through the power of the press? More of a legal thriller and less action packed then the preceding novels, TGWKTHN wraps up Stieg Larsson's unprecedented saga.<br /><br />This book was not my favorite of the three. It seemed like we were just re-hashing the same material from The Girl that Played with Fire with an added side story featuring Erica Berger who's never been a central character for me while reading the other two. It seems like they should have just combined both novels and cut a lot of the repetitious re-capping. As it is, TGWKTHN moved slowly for a thriller. Lisbeth also begins to act out of character, where's my fiercely independent and exceptionally moral Lisbeth? And what is the situation with Blomkvist? Yes, he's loyal. Yes, he's smart. But I don't know how he accomplishes anything when he bedding a female lead every ten pages.<br /><br />That said, it's a Millennium novel, so it's still smarter than almost any other book you could pick up. It goes without saying that Larsson will be greatly missed. The series as a whole? amazing! The GWKTHN as a conclusion? Somewhat disappointing.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|I'm a die hard Austen fan, so I was really excited when I heard about this BBC series. Watched it, and really enjoyed parts of it. But, there are parts that I REALLY hate, too. The pop culture references are really amusing (wet shirt Darcy...'nough said). However, I really, really didn't care for the lead actor and actress. They didn't sell their performances very well. Here and there I was pleased with them, but over all Darcy was not just proud but he was angry and grumpy or something and Amanda was just not very likable. A major draw for the novel is that Elizabeth is very likable to the reader--the reader relates to and connects with Elizabeth. That is not AT ALL the case with Amanda. I think if they had picked a different lead actress, I would have liked the character more. Also, I was not expecting the ending. I'll not say anything more because I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not watched it, but the ending threw me off.<br />All in all, this movie just rubs me the wrong way, and no true Austen P&P fan will like this for more than a couple of viewings--just for the novelty of it. Watch it once so you can say you saw it, laugh at the funny bits, and then pass it along to someone else.

1899284095|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1HWPBCP3P2S6K]]AND TOUCHING THE HEART!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This slender volume happily commits to print three essays by Lord Bingham delivered as lectures on Dr Johnson and the Law.<br /><br />Avid fans of Dr Johnson, as we are at Richmond Green Chambers, we absolutely love this book.  And, of course, we are not alone.  Even some three centuries after his birth, the fan base of our greatest litterateur, essayist and lexicographer grows apace worldwide - with not a fan among them, we are sure, who would not be entranced by the humanity and insight delivered by this little book.<br /><br />In the words of Robin de Wilde, Lord Bingham, who was regarded by his peers, as 'the perfect paragon of a judge', gave his first address on Dr Johnson and the Law on 16th April 2008 in the upper room at Dr Johnson's House in Gough Square, the same room where his Dictionary was compiled.<br /><br />It is this lecture which will have abiding fascination for contemporary legal audiences.  It's not generally known that Dr. Johnson was inordinately fond of the law and of the company of lawyers -- and if he had had the funds, would have become a lawyer himself.  Nevertheless, he was greatly assisted by the young Scottish lawyer James Boswell -- who became his biographer -- in the conduct of a number of his cases.  Dr Johnson's library, when catalogued in 1785 after his death, contained an astounding array of legal volumes including 30 volumes of Acts of Parliament.<br /><br />The second address is a sermon given in the Temple Church on 22 July 2009 to commemorate the tercentenary of Dr Johnson's birth.  Pointing out that this date was also the bicentenary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, Lord Bingham draws a number of interesting parallels between the lives of these two great men.  Physically, intellectually, philosophically and possibly spiritually, they were almost as one.<br /><br />Lord Bingham's final address on Dr. Johnson, delivered shortly before his death in September 2010, was on `Clubs and Clubbability', observing that `the eighteenth century was the age of the club.'  The tally of clubs and associations (in England we assume) apparently grew from 100 at the beginning of the century to about 6,500 at its end.<br /><br />It was an aspect of his age in which Dr Johnson revelled.  Clubs -- and clubbability - `gave him an opportunity to deploy his formidable argumentative powers,' says Lord Bingham...and `offered the company of friends which he valued so highly.'<br /><br />If you are a friend either of the law, or of Dr Johnson, or of literature, or all three, this book will nurture and augment that friendship.  If you aren't, read this meticulously footnoted book anyway. A little volume (you can read it in one sitting) that enlightens the mind and touches the heart is certainly one to treasure.ed shortly before his death in September 2010, was on `Clubs and Clubbability', observing that `the eighteenth century was the age of the club.'

0446569895|5.0|Love reading about Ozzy, by Ozzy... creative madman before he was 15 years old!  Walking down the street with a Hush puppy on a leash and an empty guitar case - thinking he looked like a Mississippi Blues Man!  Best read of the year so far!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I wish this series never died.  I wish execs would stay out of the movie/tv business sometimes.  This was quite entertaining and they had to make this movie to close the series ends.
0743289684|5.0|This book is a must-read for any intelligent adult who claims to be open-minded. Ayan Hirsi Ali is one of the most courageous human beings on the planet, and her story is a revelation to anyone interested in learning the truth about the most zealous practitioners of the \\"religion of peace.\\" Her prose style is eloquent and eminently readable. Her next book, \\"Nomad,\\" is equally spellbinding; in fact, I'm looking forward to reading anything else she's written.

B0015AARJI|1.0|So I ordered this product over 2 weeks ago. The buyer withdrew the money from my account right away, but it wasn't until I sent then a very belligerent email that that decided to just now ship my product! This buyer is fake and should be sued for theft!!

B001BPJJ9G|4.0|Remember when you were a child and your parents would read you a story before bed?  Remember how you imagination wandered and how the story became more fantastic than the words on the pages?  The Fall takes you back to that time.<br /><br />The cinematics are visually stunning, even breathtaking at points.  From dramatic wide angle landscapes, to close up personal interactions, the film keeps you held between a world of harsh realities and enthralling fantasy.<br /><br />Underneath it all is a story told from the perspective of an invalid drug addict, but seen through the eyes of a child.  There is a dichotomy between the two that allows a magnificent fantasy to unfold out of the real world suffering and blossoming friendship of the characters.<br /><br />You should see this film for the visual experience alone, but it is the characters that will keep you glued to your seat.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|Just short of the first one, but still good.
055358894X|4.0|The book is good. It is a fantasy book set in a mainly medeival world of nobles, priests, pirates, wizards (Bondsmages in this world), and thieves. Speaking of thieves, the main characters ARE thieves. The thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the ending. The main character has mainly been outwitting, not oufighting, his opponents. His strategy at the end was none too bright and not in character.

0743244257|4.0|During the last day of his life, Eric Packer conducts business and submits to medical checkups, among other activities, from the comfort of his white stretch limo.  His priority for the day is a haircut, but his progress is hampered by various traffic tie-ups, including a Presidential visit, a musician's funeral, a riot, standing water--you name it.  His assassin is a disgruntled former employee who has made phone threats and craves notoriety, but, frankly, everyone in the book is a little unbalanced.  Eric himself is the most off-key, stopping frequently for food and sex and losing his and his wife's fortune in currency speculation (intentionally?).  Is this business as usual?  He seems to vacillate between paranoia about the death threats--spurring him to keep moving and obsess about security--and resignation to his fate, which underlies the sudden dissolution of his fortune.  The book feels futuristic and robotic, but it is set in the year 2000 (published in 2003).  And leave it to DeLillo to pose this quirky question:  When you lose money in the stock market, where does it go?
B001ILHY2C|4.0|I was a fan of the original and this update was decent.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|It's a testimony to Disney-Pixar's talents that they can tell a story with minimal dialogue (true...the first half hour is dialogue free until humans enter the story). Creating one of the most original ideas in animation and imbueing it with charm & imagination, \\"WALL-E\\" is a futuristic story of a scrappy but cute robot who's on Earth for one reason: To \\"clean up\\" the mess left behind by mankind after the environment becomes completely unliveable. With a spright cockroach as his pet (it figures that roaches would survive anything) and finding solace viewing old movie musicals, WALL-E's life goes on uneventfully. That is, until a massive mother ship lands & deposits an advanced model robot named EVE. Initially hostile, EVE gradually befriends the curious robot, and sort of a romance ensues. But then, EVE completes her mission, and the mother ship returns to whisk her away, with a lovesick WALL-E as stowaway. What follows is an imaginative string of adventures as WALL-E inadvertently creates comic havoc on the ship. It's slowly revealed that this is a colony ship...except the corporate company who sponsors it (Buy 'n Large) has created sort of a \\"cruise ship paradise\\" in which automation has made its human guests obese & physically soft. When evidence reveals that plant life can be regrown to make Earth habitable again, there follows a power struggle between the ship's captain & the controlling robots serving him.   As mentioned, since there was minimal dialogue, the voice talent is minimal: Jeff Garlin voices the captain, Sigourney Weaver supplies the ship's computer voice, and you'll even hear John Ratzenberger (who's done nearly every Disney-Pixar venture). There's a cautionary message about the dangers of humanity relying too heavily on technology, and of course, a strong message about wasting our natural resources. But at the heart is that great animation (showing every little ding & scratch on WALL-E) and superior storytelling.   The DVD extras included commentary, deleted scenes, the riotously funny short \\"Presto\\", as well as a new short, \\"BURN-E\\". Definitely one to add to the Disney collection!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I wish this series never died.  I wish execs would stay out of the movie/tv business sometimes.  This was quite entertaining and they had to make Serenity to close the series ends.  I would gladly watch this series if it were to return.
B00006AW2G|4.0|I was never really into the Stones, preferred Billy Joel, Elton John...and you get the idea. It wasn't until I saw a reference to this album in a Stephen King novel called \\"Roadwork.\\" I just had to listen to what the main character was listening to when he was up to his mischief. So I downloaded the album, and I have to say, I'm glad that I did. It's more enjoyable than I anticipated. I'd say it's a great introduction album for the Stones newb.     Favorites:     Let It Bleed  Midnight Rambler  Monkey Man  You Can't Always Get What You Want    (all four songs coincidentally referenced in the Stephen King novel).
B001GQSY64|4.0|I scrambled to see this movie when it first came out in theaters.  I was a little disappointed, perhaps I had set my expectations too high?  The other day I picked up Clone Wars on Blu-ray just to add to my Star Wars collection and I'm glad I did!  I gave this movie another watch-through and I greatly enjoyed it!    One thing I think I like about the animated series of Clone Wars is that it introduces a whole new generation to Star Wars.  My dad and I bonded over the original 3 Star Wars movies, then you had the 3 prequels, and now you have a cartoon series that an even younger generation can get into.  The whole story of Star Wars is pretty much politically based, but this cartoon dumbs that down to a level that children can understand better.  I've also found it to be quite educational (God I remember when education was the last thing on my mind when watching Star Wars...)     To me, the only downside to Clone Wars is that it is slightly more childish in nature and it is animated.  However, I think this movie is a great way to continue Episode II.  I'll be honest, I prefer this movie over The Phantom Menace.  Great action scenes and the characters are well written.  This movie has led to me watching the tv series of Clone Wars as well.    If you are a Star Wars fan, I would suggest picking this up.  Maybe its not perfect for the older crowd, but I think a younger audience would truly enjoy this.  Do yourself a favor, if you do purchase Clone Wars, get the Blu-ray.  It has awesome extras and it is just such good quality.  The audio, the video, everything is so polished and clear.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Item arrived very quickly and was very reasonably priced. Item was also just as described and I would recommend buying from this seller!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am an avid exerciser and wanted something to switch up my home routine.  I like the idea of mixing in cardio with strength training and abs. The more I got used to a Level, I used my ankle weights to add more resistence and in some of the ab routines I used a weight or my medicine ball to challenge me more. Would recommend it to anyone, no matter what level you're at.
B003SWZ8C2|5.0|I borrowed this line because reviewer, Edward Jawer, said it best: \\"Read it, and become hypnotized.\\" The rich layers of characterization and plotting in THE SHADOW OF THE WIND created for me a world into which I fully immersed myself. The translation is deftly done. And I could not get enough of Fermin Romero de Torres! I simply did not want the book to end, though the end of it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />A word about the Kindle edition: Amazingly, no typos! A few words were oddly bisected with random spaces, but overall the formatting was true. Of course, because I love this book, I also will be purchasing a paper copy. (I wonder if other Kindle users find themselves in this dilemma.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I suggest you skip on past the Publishers Weekly review, which seems to have been written by someone who glanced at the blurb, skimmed the book, and didn't bother to read it.

B000WYCF6Q|1.0|I bought this mirror based on all of the raves.    First of all, the distortion is TERRIBLE. The mirror is so small and the distortion so major that you're better off with nothing at all.    The fit on the handlebars just doesn't work if you have adult-sized hands. Even when I put this on the very end of the handlebars, I had trouble positioning my hands comfortably.    There was no care given to shipping it. This was just tossed in the box with other ordered items and it was scratched up. So...distortion between the scratches, definitely not a good combo.    Please spend a few more dollars and buy something of a better quality.
B00095NX9G|4.0|I like the Yoga warm ups it has. It really has helped me (I'm a stiff, so it's a little harder for me). She's a really good instructor but goes a little too fast for my taste. I kept having to rewind in order to really get what was going on.    But over all, this is a REALLY good instructional video. Good Stuff. Oh yeah, and I'm a beginner, so I guess that might be why I have a little problem with the speed she sets.

B0015DROBO|1.0|Since this book has/had been on the best seller list for so long I expected a better read.<br />This is one of those rare books that I can put down and leave it down.  I haven't even<br />finished the first chapter and find is so hard to follow and uninteresting that I sure wish<br />I could figure out how to delete it from my Kindle.  Thank God I only paid $5.00 for it,<br />but it was truly wasted money.<br />Just say NO to this book - trust me
B00003CX8U|3.0|When I remembered having seen this movie I knew I wanted a copy for my collection. The film was enjoyable except during those moments when you notice that the voices seem to be out of sync with the actual mouth movements. This appears periodically during the film and was easily noticeable. Other than for this I would have been happy with the film to the fullest extent. This is what happens unfortunately for some vhs to dvd transfers.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Mary Shelley's Promethean tale follows the mad genius Dr. Henry Frankenstein as he attempts to create new life from dead tissue. His experiments are a success, but the being that rises from his slab is an abomination of science. Frankenstein is unable to contain his own creation, and the hulking brute is unleashed upon the unsuspecting village below.<br /><br />Although it was not the first time Shelley's novel had been adapted for the screen, James Whales will always be remembered as the man who gave life to the one true FRANKENSTEIN. The 1931 version would set the standard for every Gothic Horror film to follow, with its incredible sets, creeping atmosphere, and impeccable performances. Colin Clive shows a ferocious energy and an irresponsible enthusiasm as he declares \\"It's alive!\\" as the egomaniacal Dr. Frankenstein. The iconic look of the creature would be attributed to the great Jack Pierce, who would go on to design other such notable villains as The Mummy and The Wolf Man.<br /><br />But who is the mystery man behind the monster that is only identified by a question mark in the opening credits? Although Boris Karloff had starred in countless pictures prior to making FRANKENSTEIN, it would be this role that would jettison him into the limelight. Karloff would go on to star in dozens of Horror films in the decades to follow, but none of his performances (save for his reprisal of the character in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN) would ever reach the same level of notoriety and critical acclaim. While his towering form combined with his menacing snarls made The Monster both fearsome and frightening, it is the tender moments like the death of Maria that best demonstrate Karloff's range and form as an actor. Few, if any, have even come close to creating such a terrifying and tragic character through their performance.<br /><br />FRANKENSTEIN is the greatest of any of Universal's classic monster movies, and yet James Whales would somehow manage to outdo himself four years later in the film's stunning sequel.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesng sequel.     -Carl Manes  I Like Horror Movies
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I reviewed individual episodes of The Original Series episodes during the initial DVD release which began in 1999. So, the comments here focus on the remastered blu-ray edition.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the picture has never looked better. Colors pop off the screen, scratches have been removed, and grain, while noticeable, has been reduced to a bare minimum. Seeing the new remastering alters one's perceptions of the series. I had never noticed the tear streaming down the crippled Captain Pike's cheek as Spock reveals his plan in \\"The Menagerie.\\" Unfortunately, with the improved picture, flaws in the original production are also more noticeable: shadows from boom microphones are detectable, zippers can be clearly seen in many of the uniforms, and a certain hairpiece has never been more obvious. Still, the picture shows the obvious care taken with the lighting and composition - very different from today's flatly-lit, smash & grab style of television filming.<br /><br />Of course, the primary focus of this new release is the new CGI visual effects. Trek had a number of effects heavy episodes, including \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" and \\"The Tholian Web,\\" and they benefit the most from the new effects. Most of the new space shots are very convincing, remaining in the original spirit of the series. Only a few of the shots are major deviations from the originals, such as when the shuttle is seen exiting the Enterprise from the outside. Restraint seems to be the watchword here, and I would have liked to have seen a little bit more done, such as the replacement of some very dated view screen graphics in \\"The Changeling,\\" and correction to faulty composite shots, such as in \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"  But the enhanced background plate in \\"By Any Other Name\\" is simply stunning, and the expanded castle front seen in \\"Catspaw\\" (an otherwise weak episode) is subtly done.  Toggling between the CGI and original effects, I was struck by how much the old effects distracted me from the story - more so than when there was no CGI option.  I've already been spoiled.  The new sound mix complements the improved picture, without calling attention to itself.  Compare with the mono original, also included, for a demonstration of the importance of sound design.<br /><br />With the exception of The Cage and expanded version of Where No Man has Gone Before, the episodes include audio tracks in Spanish and French, although much of the Spanish dialogue is not faithful to the English originals. As for bonus features, most are carried over from the 2004 reissue, but the real highlight is Billy Blackburn's behind the scenes movies, which show the actors in costume but out of character - a real treat.- more so than when there was no CGI option.

B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Debra Granik's WINTER'S BONE is one of the better films of 2010.  It's an intimate portrait of rural Missouri, revolving around seventeen-year-old Ree, whose meth-manufacturing father has left her to care for two younger siblings and a sick mother.  Ree's father Jessup has gone missing, but he put his property up for bond.  Meaning, if Ree doesn't find her father within a week--either that, or proof that he is dead--she looses the house and the land.  Unfortunately, her father's extended family seems inclined to let sleeping dogs lie, to the extent that Ree finds herself in genuine danger.  Her only accomplice, if you can call him that, is her uncle Teardrop, who may be as dangerous as everyone else around her.<br /><br />As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence carries this film on her more-than-capable shoulders; she is the rock of the film, anchoring it down so tightly that even the other stellar performances--especially John Hawkes as Teardrop--pale by comparison.  A lot of the cast aren't even professional actors, which lends the film an extra air of authenticity (that, and the fact that it was shot on location).  WINTER'S BONE is, without a doubt, a small production; and while that can sometimes ruin a movie, here it helps.  The script is good though not wholly memorable; the real grit here lies in the actors' performances, without which this film would've been a mediocre idea and best forgotten.  As is, it's nominated for 4 Academy Awards, and goes down as one of the best films of 2010 (a year in which quite a few good movies were made).
0393338827|5.0|This is the second Michael Lewis book I have read, the other being The Blind Side.  I really did not have a clue what this book would be about, but took a shot at it based on how much I loved The Blind Side.    The Big Short worked in a very similar fashion to The Blind Side, in that in TBS if you knew nothing about football it was still a great story, and you learned a great deal in a very non-technical way.  I found that I learned a ton about the bond market, of which I had absolutely no knowledge prior to reading this book, and found that I had a very difficult time putting it down.  Even though I knew how it would end (market crashing, businesses failing, etc.), it was still riveting.  Lewis entwined bits of financial knowledge with character introduction and development throughout the story in such a way that it kept you begging for more.  Lewis explains most of the basic concepts in a sentence or a brief paragraph.  He explains basically how the bond market worked and how shorts and \\"longs\\" worked in this world.  The overview of the \\"game\\" was great in that it did not bore you with unwieldy details but gave you enough to feel you could explain in general terms what actually happened.    I really did not know how or why our financial system collapsed the way that it did, nor am I sure I have a good handle on it now.  However, I do feel that this book opened my eyes a great deal into the way the bond market behaves, and the financial markets in general work and how corrupt the system really is.  Listening to a great deal of politics, one finds that each side blames the other and fingers are pointed all over the political map, just not at one's own party.  But this book did not enter into the political arena at all.  Instead, it showed how the financial institutions took what the political system gave them and twisted it to their own ends in order to make the most money possible and damn the consequences.  It was very eye opening.    Some of the characters in thestory were hilarious - from Eisman the \\"sincerely rude\\" individual to Dr. Burry who was essentially an isolationist, and all the idiots at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc. who got gamed by their own system.  These people were great.  The mental images created about these guys in meetings, what they were saying, what they thought but did not say, and the outcomes were entertaining as hell.    I highly recommed this book.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Before this cooler i was using the OCZ vendetta 2 which got for a similar price, but this appealed to me because it has mounts for two fans. I should note that it only comes with one fan, and the fan that it does come with is mediocre, I replaced it with a scythe fan from newegg. At full load, in normal room temperature, it keeps my q6600 overclocked to 3.4 (1 Ghz overclock) at a very reasonable 55 degrees C and at idle it is around 30 degrees C. I should also note that i keep the fans in my case quite enough to where you can only hear them if your right next to the computer(the loudest thing in my case in my 4870). This isn't the best air cooler out there, but you cannot beat the price per performance.
0141192453|4.0|I had read the book before I purchased it. I love the story. When I received the book through amazon there was significant water damage and the paint was peeling of the cover. It was said to be \\"new.\\" Perhaps it was ruined during shipping, but my other two Penguin Hardcover Classics in the same order were perfectly intact. Whatever the case may be, I was still saving money purchasing through Amazon.
0316098337|4.0|What a beautiful book this is!  Beautiful, smart, compassionate, and simply riveting.  There are a couple of problems in the language: the story is meant to take place in the U.S., but Donoghue is Irish, and her characters use Irish locutions such as \\"Will I read you a book?\\" or \\"Will I serve you some peas?\\"  It's a little jarring, but not a serious issue.  I have some problems as the book goes on with never getting Ma's perspective or voice, and there's a shopping-mall scene that's extended and not entirely plausible--all in all, however, this is one of the most moving novels I've read in a long time.  It haunted me afterward for weeks; the actual reading of it was exhilarating, but the story it tells is a horror story, and that combination is deeply--if meaningfully--disturbing.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Fast, excellent service and communications. Album exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend Import CDS as a seller. I will continue to do business with them
B000002JSN|5.0|One of the greatest rock albums EVER!<br /><br />This is Led Zeppelin at their prime: stunning vocals, awe-inspiring guitars and basses, and captivating drums. The songs are masterful, first-rate, timeless, [other descriptive terms that I can't think of at the moment]. \\"Custard Pie,\\" \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" and of course, \\"Kashmir\\" are my favorites on this album, while the rest are still excellent from beginning to end. \\"The Rover,\\" \\"In the Light,\\" \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" \\"Night Flight\\" and others would surely please almost all hard rock fans in the world. And I mean it. This is a milestone in 70's Rock 'N' Roll. What worries me, however, that there could be a possibility that Physical Graffiti could be forgotten a few decades later, due to the fact that the music of today caters mainly to the pop crowd. I hope that doesn't happen, and I hope more people over the years will listen to rock music (whether it be classic, heavy metal, progressive, or whatever). In the meantime, Physical Graffiti is a masterpiece, and I'm so glad that I've had a chance to delve into Led Zeppelin's music.<br /><br />Grade: 10/10
B002L7TMAE|5.0|The packaging is attractive.  The liner notes are only in French.  The selection of music is complete for the period covered, which in my opinion is Ms. Hardy's best period.  But what really sets this box set apart is the quality of the remastering.  The music just sounds so natural and pure, like Francoise is in the room with you.  I have this and the Vogue Years collection (also excellent).  The sound is better on this box set.  I'd say it is definitely worth the money.
030746363X|2.0|-What bothers me the most is that the book keeps referring the reader to his website or other people's websites.<br />If I'm going to buy a book, I'm buying it because I want to hold it in my hands and READ it. I can go online anytime.  If I had read the table of contents more carefully and had noticed how much space each topic got, I would not have bought this book. Given the number of repetitions,  this book needs to go on a diet.<br /><br />There's good advice in this book but none of it is appropriate for women my age (62). There are a lot of us out there over the age of 50,  serious lifters, runners and swimmers not in aerobics classes. This exclusion makes no sense. The big clue that this is NOT for the girls is the lengthy chapter on the best way to make love to a woman.<br /><br />The book is entirely geared to men between the ages of 18 and 40.  It is basically about winning, not about getting your game better- run better, swim better.<br /><br />The writer is really long-winded and takes up too much time and space defending his ideas with tedious proofs and name-dropping.  Lots and lots of of name dropping - I don't care what rich guy or celebrity is involved with his program, I just want the info straight and without so much verbiage.<br /><br />If I wanted to read a book that was about weight loss, I would have bought one. Nearly 1/4 of the book is devoted  to losing weight. It is boring for anyone who is already in good shape to have to plow thru this kind of info.<br /><br />The chapter on working thru an injury is ok, but again, nothing that can't be easily found on line.<br /><br />His off the cuff comments about aerobics and vitamins are really funny and are among the few comments he makes that are unique, interesting and valuable.
0061537969|4.0|This was an OK story. I was a little disappointed after reading it, because it was so highly recommend to me. I think the author's agent did a really good job marketing this book. I suppose if you're a dog lover you will find something in it for you, but the real story is a love story, and what a husband goes through watching his wife's slow demise from brain cancer. (as told through a dog's eyes)
0385341008|3.0|All I can say is that I was disappointed in this book. The way it was written through letters was a nice change of the norm, but besides that; It was a normal book to me. Nothing special. I don't want to kill the ending -so I won't- I will just say that I hate books that are mediocre and all tied together with a pretty bow at the end. If that doesn't make sense to you now, it will when you are done with the book.

This book was written with such thought and care and vision that I would not have changed a word of it. This author is one of the BEST word shakers I have never met. I just don't understand the reasoning behind it being classified as Young Adult Literature. I almost didn't read it for that very reason. I am glad I got past that labeling and added it to my book club's list. I can't wait to discuss it! Note: I am highly critical

B000025XKM|5.0|This is a tremendous little gem that I discovered from an AT&T ad on TV.  The guitar had a haunting melody that I just had to research.  I found out it was \\"From the Morning\\" by Nick Drake.  I've heard of Drake in passing before, and have probably heard a song or two on the radio without knowing who it was, but this CD blew me away.  I love the textured guitar work, and recognize several tunes that newer artists have \\"borrowed\\" from.  One sounds like something Dave Mathews & Tim Reynolds might have played, and another sounds amazingly like music that Steve Howe (YES) might have played.  I'm guessing Drake must have influenced several later artists.  Too bad he passed at such a young age.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Must admit that I really love this cd.  What continues to appeal to me about Josh is his choice of music which I find very brooding and his voice which is not only beautiful but also has a very soulful quality.  This cd is no exception.        After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure about about buying this cd, but fortunately I understand that reviews generally reflect preferences, not fact.  I ordered it and have listened to nothing else since it arrived.  I love all the songs on this cd and appreciate each one on it's own; they are so unique and he approaches each one differently.  His voice is as beautiful and soulful as ever but in these songs there is a very appealling raw quality to his sound which only adds to the emotion and meaning.  For me, there are no negatives regarding this cd - music selection, singing, production.  But then, I really hate Wagner's Ring Cycle; and even though I know that there are thousands of people who will cross a continent, even an ocean to see a production of it, I still hate it.  It's all a matter of preference.  But I do love Josh's \\"Illuminations\\".

Catchy tunes and intelligent lyrics throughout.  I've read some \\"true\\" Decembrist fans who think they've sold out on this one.  If so, then good for them.  I hope they pick up legions of new fans.  I now plan on going back to their earlier CDs and see what I've been missing.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|I've heard it said that this album represents the Decemberists returning to their roots, which I can't comment on, as I know only a handful of songs from their early days. But I can say that this album is musically so rich, and lyrically so beautiful, that anyone who likes this style of slightly elegiac roots-influenced folky music should love it.  The tunes are simple and singable; the harmonies are beautiful; the instrumentation is lush. And the lyrics are *worth* singing:<br /><br />let the yolk fall from your shoulders<br />Don't carry it all, don't carry it all<br />We are all our hands and holders<br />Beneath this bold and brilliant sun<br /><br />So urges the first song on the album, \\"Don't Carry It All.\\"<br /><br />Or, in \\"Rox in the box,\\" a song with a Celtic feel to it:<br /><br />And you wont make a dime<br />on this gray Granite Mountain Mine<br />Of dirt you're made and to dirt you will return<br />So while we're living here<br />Let's get this litte one thing clear<br />There's plenty of men to die; you don't jump your turn<br /><br />I could go on like this. But listen to the MP3 clips available. This is a gorgeous album, and if it's your style of music, you'll be listening to it constantly, I promise.

This band is hot in Europe (they are from the UK) and I sincerely hope they go on tour in the US soon as I will be sure to see them \\"live\\".
0061537969|5.0|Life is a series of ups and downs, peaks and valleys; it is darkness and light intertwined. No one said life is fair and the true mettle of our character is revealed when we face the inevitable adversities of our existence. \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" by Garth Stein is not about recovery (not recovery form addiction at least), but the \\"sharp wit, self-deprecating humor, and penetrating honesty,\\"<br /><br />  It's a fictional story that is inspirational, sad, and at times, laugh out loud funny. It's funny because the story is told in the first person from the point of view of Enzo, the family dog. It's sad because it deals with loss and the main character's struggle to keep his life together when he is plotted against in a most loathsome and hideous manner. It is inspirational because he handles his adversities counter-intuitively, thereby keeping his dignity intact and his goals attainable. In other words, he knows how to race in the rain.<br /><br />  \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is one of those books that keep you thinking about it long after you've put it down. Telling the story from the dog's point of view was an ingenious literary device that allows the reader to explore life's complexities from a unique perspective. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the emotional roller-coaster ride of a feel-good story that leaves you with hope, faith and confidence in our ability to transcend the worries of this world.<br /><br />David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"

0060555661|5.0|That quote sums up the Intelligent Investor and it's value based investing approach and has stuck in my mind since. This book, and it's updates by Jason Zweig, was excellently crafted and provided a fascinating history of the markets from the 19th to 21st century. For those that are looking to the book to be the gospel for investing, disuade yourself of that notion right away; even Warren Buffet who idolised Graham moved away (to a certain degree) from his strict investment approach of focusing on cheap stocks (relative to the underlying value of the company). The value of the book for me was realising that the volatility of the market wasn't confined to the events I knew; the prominent ones in the past, the 1929 & 1987 incidents and the more recent ones, the 2000 crash (after which I started working in fund management) and finally the 2007/2008 collapse. Reading Grahams book and the Zweig's updates you realise these boom bust cycles have been going on, with more or less the same frequency as recent times, since the markets first opened. New get rich approaches to investing in the stock market get dusted off and recycled, new more complex ones come along. In the short term no one can can consistently predict what the market will do let alone an indiviual stock, but in the long run through value analysis and the experiences in this book you can set yourself up with a solid foundation for successful investing.
B002ZG981E|1.0|While watching Inception, I found myself wishing it would end. I kept watching because I wanted to see whether the protagonist gets back to see his children. The idea behind the plot is intriguing: affecting a person's subconscious. But, it drags on too long and with too many confused references. I never really knew what was going on and found I didn't care. I enjoy Dicaprio's performances normally and have always liked Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard in whatever they do; yet I wished throughout the film that the characters be much more developed. The action scenes were spectacular but I never fully understood why they were taking place other than to make the film attractive to an action-oriented audience. I enjoyed the scene in the hotel hallway with two men fighting in a weightless state and the computer graphic renderings of a city in 3-D. Clearly a lot of effort and talent went into the film but it does not come together for my taste.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas, so misleadingly referred to as a \\"novel,\\" is actually a cycle of short stories that follows the reincarnations of one soul on its journey through human history.  Each of the stories can be read by itself, but like any short story cycle, the work takes on new dimensions of meaning when the stories are read alongside one another.  Mitchell's gimmick, if it can be called that, interrupts each story at a cliffhanger; after five cliffhangers, and one story told without interruption, CA finishes out with a rapid-fire succession of denouements and ends where the story began, circa 1850.<br /><br />I would recommend CA, but hesitantly.  For those looking for a book resting somewhere between thoughtful literature and thoughtless pulp, Cloud Atlas is a good choice.  The characters are interesting and the plots are eccentric and fun, which makes CA an overall engaging read.  Mitchell's control of different styles is also quite admirable, and is exemplified (in my opinion) by the epistolary mode of Adam Ewing and the dialectal, post-apocalyptic romp of Zachry.  Each character sounds like themselves, and none of the characters rehashes any others.<br /><br />On the other hand, for those looking for a book that will challenge them intellectually or morally, or will introduce them to characters so near to flesh and blood that we forget their literary origins, look elsewhere.  The characters in CA were never deep or complex enough for my tastes and never emerged from the stories as real people.  Frobisher comes closest with his intriguing mix of aristocratic insouciance and volatile brashness, and his unquenchable passion for music.  No wonder Mitchell grants him such a meta-fictionally important role.  However, he never takes on the different dimensions one might expect a character of his potential to develop; while multifaceted, he lacks the light necessary to sparkle.<br /><br />Similarly, Mitchell seems to lack the maturity and wisdom to write a book of that particular sublime caliber for which some of us are always searching.  If you're willing to aim below sublime, however, then give this book a chance.  It's good, exciting fiction and definitely several cuts above most of the garbage circulating in print.or which some of us are always searching.

0679422714|4.0|Most, if not all of the One-Star reviews are written by Chinese apologists or Western apologists for China.  The false-reviewers main complaint is thus: \\"self-perpetuated myths of Mao are \\"well-settled\\" and there is no use for revisionism.\\"  How convenient; lets all rely on China's propaganda machine to \\"settle the issues\\" for all eternity.  One of the well-known axioms in history writing is that history is almost never written correctly unless it's 50-100 years removed from the subject.  All previous attempts at humanizing Mao suffer from this defect and suffer from political concerns while Maoists were still in charge.  Once this whole embarrassing chapter in human history is seen from afar, people can start accepting the truth.  This book goes a long way in finding the TRUTH.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|When I heard that Disney was going to film a story about Big Red I had my doubts. How were they going to tell the story of the greatest thoroughbred of all time, and would it do him justice? I needn't have worried; they did all of that and more. This is a film I guarantee you will watch again and again. The casting couldn't have been better. Diane Lane and John Malkovich were the perfect choices for their roles; in fact, the entire cast was amazing. Even though I knew the Great One's story front and back, I was on the edge of my seat during all of his race scenes. Big Red's performance at the Belmont will never, never be equaled and I am certain that any future portrayals on the silver screen will never be the equal to this wonderful film. If you love horses, and the bond that we have with them, then this is the movie for you. When Secretariat passed away, his autopsy showed his heart was twice the size of a normal horse. How fitting, because this film has twice the heart. Watch, live, learn, and love. This is the legacy of Big Red.

B003VYAVGA|5.0|I LOVE this album.      I've never been a fan of Take That...traditional boyband stuff was just never my thing -     HOWEVER, I did fall in with once-former-now-returned Robbie Williams' solo work some ten years ago, when he began with his guitar-rooted, Oasis-emulating phase (loved them as a teenager) and he is probably the reason I came around to liking straight-up pop music at all (as opposed/in addition to popular & classic rock bands and indie).  He's interesting, he's evolved, very flawed and philosophical about it - and LOVES to talk about this with lyrics that are poetry (occasionally somewhat bad poetry, lol - but if you love him, it's enjoyable regardless) - and his best vocal moments are very raw & emotionally genuine. He appreciates a lot of pop genres - past , present & future - and plays around with them all, and has been incredibly successful with that approach pretty much everywhere but in the US.      ANYWAY - this album marks the return of Robbie to the fold of Take That - the band he quit/was fired from 15 years ago due to his substance abuse problems, forcing the band itself to break up shortly thereafter.  Robbie of course went on to become a huge solo star - and the band ultimately reformed without him around 2006 and made some great records, evolved from their old cheesy stuff, but still pretty much bland adult contemporary (in my opinion) - though of high quality.  Remarkable was that this band - 90% a dance act that got their start in gay clubs and wooed teen girls across the globe - made the leap from being typical manufactured dance/harmony-bots and began to take control of their own creative destiny and become a true band, more than a decade after they'd disbanded.    Robbie's return has brought further legitimacy to their control over their work, and there's a lot of his flavor on the record. He's always had an ability to deal with complex ideas in a simple, catchy, mass-consumable way (which shows more intelligence, not less, for not being esoteric, in my opinion). It's why he's a huge pop star.     Thanks to Rob (and to the chagrin of some TT fans, probably), this is not an album that panders to a swooning audience, but showcases the points-of-view & experiences of its makers.  And they are a bunch of British guys with working class roots, aged 37-42, contemplating aging, social anxiety, mature relationships, their collective pop past and the fate of the weird world we all now live in. Many songs have a lot of Robbie's trademark paranoia, grit & darkness lodged within, but the songs are still polished into fine pop confections - many dancey & beat-driven with a couple of bigger ballads. The harmonies they excel at persist, and you can tell it's not truly the Robbie Show - everyone bought in to the 'Progress' concept, contributed, and is having a great time with it.  It's a fun pop record, which works on both shallow & deeper levels.    After a great flow of tracks from \\"The Flood\\" to \\"Underground Machine\\", 'Progress' hits a bit of a wall with \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" - Mark Owen's song, which could've used more refinement from its slightly too raw & personal state. It's a bit of stumbling block to get past, with the remainder of the album's tracks - except the sappy glory of \\"Eight Letters\\" - notably lacking Robbie's songwriting vigor.  But at that point, if you've fallen for the redemptive story of the reformation of Take That, you overlook weakness and are interested to hear the stripped down POVs Gary, Mark, Howard & Jason have to contribute, too.    It's a really good album if you like strong pop albums.  It's a GREAT album if you're a Robbie fan, and/or are willing to dive into the overall Take That story behind it all.

B000P46QTA|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" (2006) is directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (The Tourist). The film takes place in the German Democratic Republic before the fall of the Berlin wall in 1984, and is a fictional story that revolves around the monitoring of a playwright by the secret police (Stasi). What is intriguing about the film is the meticulous drama that unfolds as the spy becomes emotionally involved with those he is spying on, but in the film, as in the real life of the Stasi, the spy is always looking over his own shoulder. This intricate story leaves one continually guessing where things will eventually lead when the leading characters' moral dilemmas are brought to the forefront.<br /><br />This German film went on to win the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The blu-ray has a number of special features, including deleted scenes, an interview with the director, a director's commentary, and a making of the film featurette.

I am also skeptical about a lot of the stories in this book like Dave Palumbo who must have more than doubled his weight  assumably pure muscle. But without using some type of controlled substance? That's highly questionable. And that sexual chapter was a totally inappropriate chapter for book covering this topic, in my opinion.

But learning where your dog's 'tickle spots' are is hugely important in teaching the dog, in making your dog feel really loved and rewarded, for example.

The fictionalized-Victorian setting is really cool, and the author has created and keeps the story in a dry old humor thats as far politically-incorrect from today's standards as possible.  I've enjoyed this novel, like I have with many other works by Alan Moore.
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech,\\" is a pivotal moment in British Monarch history in this factual based account of (Albert Frederick Arthur George) aka, \\"The Duke of York.\\" The Duke (Colin Firth) turns to an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) in hopes of controlling a lifetime speech impediment. Brother of King Edward VIII, the Duke is crowned King George VI unexpectedly when Edward stepped down declaring his desire to marry his mistress, an American divorcée. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, King George publicly announced to the world that Brittan declared war against Germany. The King's speech was well received with coaching from his long time friend and speech therapist Lionel. Actress Helena Bonham Carter (Alice and Wonderland, Howard's End, A Room with a View) and actor Guy Pearce, round out the rest of the supporting cast. Colin Firth's performance is worth of a 2011 Oscar for best actor as is Geoffrey Rush for best actor in a supporting role and \\"The King's Speech,\\" is most deserving of motion picture of the year. 7 potato more.
B004HO6HYI|2.0|You've probably seen the ads for I Am Number Four. The TV spots seem to be interesting and confusing at the same time since they leave you with more questions than anything, which can be a good thing. Trailers that reveal everything about the film they're promoting are the worst. However, Michael Bay's involvement (despite only being a producer) probably puts many off right from the start considering all the Platinum Dunes remakes Bay has produced over the years; effectively killing whatever interest they may have originally had. Unfortunately the film seems to leave you with just as many questions that you walked in with.<br /><br />I Am Number Four is based on the novel sharing the same name by Pittacus Lore (the pen name for authors James Frey and Jobie Hughes). It's also supposed to be the first in a six-part series. The film version of I Am Number Four feels like it doesn't explain half of the things it needs to. The film leaves you with quite a few unanswered questions and while it's obvious a sequel will more than likely be on the cards if the film is a success, I Am Number Four doesn't really feel like an origin story. Well, it actually feels like you walked into an origin story about twenty minutes too late like you missed the entire backstory or something. Interestingly enough, half of the questions you may have can probably be answered with the Wikipedia page for the novel. Why the film doesn't touch on some of these is kind of a mystery though.<br /><br />The film also left me feeling questionable regarding my opinion of the film. There were certain parts that were enjoyable, but it also felt kind of terrible at the same time. The film revolved around high school more than expected. It felt like the film could've easily been called something like, \\"My high school boyfriend glows in the dark and I don't know why.\\" The whole sideplot of Sam's father seemed kind of pointless, as well. So he discovered Loriens and decided to help them before disappearing. Why should we care? That's never really explained. Sam finally realizing his dad's fantasy becoming a reality and his desire to find him made sense, but why the film had to keep coming back to his dad helping the aliens only for it to go nowhere just seemed unnecessary.<br /><br />The action scenes are probably the film's highlight. Surprising for a film produced by Michael Bay, eh? Loud, a heavy use of special effects, and explosions and massive destruction around every corner are enough to satisfy even the most deprived action junkie. But the shaky camera technique rears its ugly head to ruin something decent yet again. Whipping the camera back and forth probably didn't help matters either. It was the first special effects heavy film for D.J. Caruso though, so maybe that had something to do with it. Speaking of special effects and awkward camera techniques, the Mogadorians' beasts look incredibly similar to the Cloverfield monster if it had flying squirrel capabilities. The battle scenes between John's shape-shifting beagle Bernie Kosar and one of the beasts is both sour and sweet at the same time. The Godzilla fan in me loved the fact that I got to see two giant monsters fighting each other, but the logical side in me basically reminded me that I was watching a glorified version of the ending to Van Helsing, which isn't a compliment at all.<br /><br />The cast isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done. Most of the chemistry in the film is shared between Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron since the love between their characters is basically the central theme of the story. Although, the two of them seem rather dull on their own. John swears up and down he knows how to \\"be invisible\\" and \\"blend in,\\" so that obviously means being as conspicuous as you can possibly be. Wearing a hood when no one else is and flashing lights that reside in your hands probably isn't the best way to try and go unnoticed. Meanwhile, Sarah has a thing for cameras and that's about it. Callan McAuliffe's Sam plays the rather cliche nerdy guy fairly well while the same can be said for Jake Abel's typical jock/scumbag character Mark. Timothy Olyphant is easily the best part of the cast, but still felt a little flat overall. However, he spits out a few speeches that steal whatever scene he's a part of.<br /><br />I Am Number Four probably isn't a good film at the end of the day, but it does have some good elements and will be mistakenly perceived as a good film because of them. If you're a fan of explosive sci-fi action sequences, it is probably worth seeing for that reason alone. The film's biggest downfall is that it's rather confusing at times if you haven't read the book and the film does a rather haphazard job of getting first time viewers up to speed. However, if you can somehow see it for cheap then it isn't the absolute worst way to waste two hours.liche nerdy guy fairly well while the same can be said for Jake Abel's typical jock/scumbag character Mark.

0307454541|5.0|After hearing so much about this book and seeing that it was made into a movie I decided to read it.  A friend of mine who also read it said to wait about 100 pages before you make any decisions as to how the book is.  I found that it takes about that many pages to sort out all the characters and place the plots in the right order.  In other words allow the story to unfold.  The murder mystery has to be one of the best stories put together and written in book form.  I now am ready for the movie.  Reading The Girl who Played with Fire and will also get around to The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest.  I hope my favorite character Salander is around for the last book as well.  She kicks ass.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Anxiety.  Nightmare.  Sex.  Misfit.  Surrealism begs a translation, and my interpretation is that the 'baby' is Henry's anxiety that manifests in everything he experiences.  He created it, literally and figuratively.  The misbegotten and misshapen thing is the malformed inner person of Henry made manifest.  He cannot escape his anxiety -- his world barely supports life.  Even the plant in his apartment is dead.  His girlfriend is mad, her family is oddly inappropriate, and he cannot create but only erase.  He is afraid that his neighbor, with whom he fantasizes about having sex, sees his malformed inner self, the mewling, needy, grossly immature thing that he is.  But in the end, uncovering the core of his anxiety, he is able to overcome it, as seen in the calm expression that suffuses his face as he is bathed by light in the embrace of the lady in the radiator.  Sure, the process was disturbing -- who has the courage to face their own shameful inner malformed self in order to slay it?  Henry did.

B00005K9LN|4.0|The album begins with Rapid fire -> a very heavy song with an adrenaline dose. Next comes Metal Gods -> its between just ok and i like it . then Breaking the law -> its one of the most known songs in this album but i don't like it at all (its a little immature). Then we have Grinder which with Rapid fire are the best songs in this album and of course i like it. Then united sounds a little wussy , thanks but no thanks. You don't have to be old to be wise its just ok . Living after midnight is another wussy song. The rage is a very good song with very remembered music. And then steeler its a nice songs with solo (yeah). I don't like the fact that there are no solos (only in 2 tracks i thinks and very small) . The production is not for 2011 but lets say we don't count this. So we have a 4/5 star heavy metal album.

030726999X|4.0|[[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]]<br /><br />Picking up directly after the end of the previous volume and concluding the cliffhanger that ended it, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest begins extracting shreds of justice for Lisbeth Salander as the story sprints towards the millennium trilogy's finale.<br /><br />As with the other two volumes, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and The Girl Who Played With Fire, Larsson wastes little time with metaphorical flourishes or other narrative embellishments. The writing is straightforward and well-paced, and a lot of thorough description puts the reader in the mind of the characters and at the scene of the action.<br /><br />But first, Salander, the subject of a nationwide manhunt, has to be cleared of charges that she murdered three people. With his usual eye for exacting detail, Larsson sets about clearing Salander by describing all of the charges against her, which by necessity updates the reader on the story so far.<br /><br />You have to marvel at how much work Larsson has put into each of these three volumes, which displays an extraordinary amount of energy, research, and typing. However, devising a twin sister for Salander, who is barely mentioned in the three novels, and is never seen, is an unnecessary contrivance for a writer who is so adept at creating memorable main characters, and a plethora of ingenious supporting cast members.<br /><br />Larsson spends an entire short chapter describing the background and activities of the secret service operative who originally helped to send the young Salander to the psych ward, and now wants to prevent that plan from gaining public scrutiny. The result of this description is a narrative shockwave that pushes the story into a higher gear.<br /><br />In several divergences that reminds the reader that the story is also about journalists and journalism, Larsson shows former Millennium Magazine editor Erika Berger's first day at work at her new job as publisher of one of the country's large daily newspapers, describing the personal clashes and power struggles that she encounters. Woven into Berger's new duties is an excellent commentary on the media frenzy surrounding Salander's erroneous murder charges, which Berger helps a young reporter to understand, and shows him how to determine whether a source is being truthful.<br /><br />In another journalistic aside, a young Millennium Magazine reporter describes his meticulous investigative handiwork in uncovering fraud in the Swedish construction industry that has dire implications for Berger's new CEO.<br />We also witness the stalking incident that sent Berger to the emergency room. All of this detail is tightly woven into the fast-paced narrative, and the reader feels no need to skip any of it. Indeed, it enriches the narrative.<br /><br />The action moves to the courtroom as Bloomkvist convinces his sister, Annika Giannini, a women's rights attorney, to handle Salander's defense on the numerous charges she faces, even though the state prosecutor has dropped the three murder charges against her.<br /><br />As the prosecution mounts what appears to be an ironclad case against Salander, her attorney only offers minimal comments and objections until presenting a vigorous and ingenious defense, aided by a cadre of people who want to make sure Salander is not committed to an asylum again. As is his custom in this series, Larsson uses an immense amount of detail about the legal and criminal malfeasance that not only frees Salander, but topples the cadre of secret service operatives that helped to send the teenaged Salander to a mental institution.<br /><br />Once freed, Salander heads to Gibraltar to relax and the story begins to lag as she binges on alcohol and initiates sexual liaisons with strangers. The narrative tension only resumes when Salander returns to Sweden and confronts her half-brother, the murderous Ronald Niedermann, who tried to kill her in The Girl WhoPlayed With Fire.<br /><br />They engage in a mano-a-mano denouement that brings the series to a startling conclusion, and reunites Salander and Mikael Bloomkvist in what could likely be a prelude to another adventure. If only the Larsson family, and Stieg Larsson's longtime partner, Eva Gabrielsson, could agree on how and when to publish it.the series to a startling conclusion, and reunites Salander and Mikael Bloomkvist in what could likely be a prelude to another adventure.

B00005NB0H|5.0|This album is actually less of a CD and more of the experience of being at the show itself.     Apart from it's holistic/collective brilliance, it is just as appealing from a purely instrumental stance. Keith Moon, John Entwistle and Pete Townshend all sound brilliant. This is as much to do with their skill as musicians as the remastered sound. I cannot single any of the players here including of course Roger Daltry and the other musicians during \\"Tommy\\" that is not on equal par in terms of musicianship.    Seriously man, I can't really say words how epic this album is. You can tell that all The Who are having a great time, they all sound full of energy and inspired. One of the really nice parts is when Pete chats to the crowd after \\"I'm A Boy\\" and just has a laugh with them.   One of the funniest moments on the album is during \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\\" when Keith rephrases Pete's opening line to \\"Good morning w*****s!\\" So funny!    Definitely recommend this

B004G600A4|5.0|Background:<br /><br />Tangled has its origins from the German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.<br />It was first published in 1812 as part of a collection of children's tales. It is believed that this story was an adaptation from a fairy tale called Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force which was originally published in 1698. It is a story that has been beaten to a pulp, and is best know for the line: \\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair\\".<br /><br />Even further back, this story may seem to be a modified feminized version of the Biblical story of Samson as related to in the book of Judges chapter 13. Here because Samson was a Nazarite a razor was never allowed to touch his hair.<br /><br />Marketing and Sales:<br /><br />This film was originally titled and marketed as Rapunzel, however, at the last minute the name was changed to Tangled. It is the second most expensive film ever made and most expensive animated film ever made with a budget of $260 million. Tangled is also notable for being the third-highest grossing animated film in the Disney animated canon (unadjusted for inflation), behind The Lion King ($783,841,776) and Aladdin ($504,050,219).<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is just about to turn 18 years old. She wants a special gift, to go outside of the tower that she has been in for her entire life. Her mother, Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) buntly refuses. As an alternative, she asks for more paint (she paints as one of her many past times in the tower). Mother Gothel agrees to go for it, but it's a 3-days journey away.<br /><br />While she is away, Rapunzel manages to strike up a bargain with Flynn Rider, a thief on the run (voiced by Zachery Levi). At this point her voyage to the outside world begins.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />It is quite surprising that this 100 minute animated feature has been given a rating of PG instead of G. In my opinion this may be due to the emotional and psychological content that Mother Gothel generates by her deceptive and manipulative relationship with Rapunzel. (since there is no nudity or offensive language in this film)<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Gothel observes a single drop of pure sunlight hit the ground, creating a magical flower with the ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as keep someone young by singing to it. Centuries past as she maintains her youth. Until the pregnant queen of a nearby kingdom gets sick. Her guards manage to retrieve the flower and make a broth out of it. The queen is healed, however, as a side-effect, her daugther is born with hair with the same magical properties.<br /><br />Gothel realises this and kidnaps the child and raises her as her own. But, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky longing for their lost princess to return. Rapunzel desires to find the source of these lights a theit true purpose.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is an excellent family film, with lots of musical content as well as humor. Highly recommended.and manipulative relationship with Rapunzel.

B004NSULHM|5.0|I am a fan of all of Radioheads albums, but especially love the experimentation of Kid A. Its actually my favorite album. Ever since, I have liked Radiohead's post Kid A albums, but despite the experimentation on the later albums, I've been somewhat disappointed that the albums didn't reach the same level of atmospherics and obliqueness. The King of Limbs is a return to the feeling and experimentation of Kid A. While not a huge step forward, it has some of the strangeness and outerworldlyness of Kid A mixed with the musical beauty of In Rainbows. Yes, the album is quite short, although it is better than EPs which the band has alluded to and also I have a feeling we might see some more releases from the band either later this year or next year. If you are a fan of only pre-Kid A Radiohead, you will likely cavetch about this, but if you appreciate the psychedelic and unconventional later releases, this album is sure to please.

0091933684|3.0|This book is artfully done.  Full color photos are great.  The recipes are inspiring and out of the ordinary.  The only problem, measurements are in metric units and some of the ingredients I've never even heard of, let alone able to find them in the grocery store.  I think they are items that are eaten more in other countries.  As someone who loves exotic gourmet foods, and would dare call myself a foodie, definitely made me realize that there are lots of produce and seasonings that I have yet to discover.  Have to pick through the ones with more available ingredients but definitely worth the money overall.  Print out a metric conversion table for easier measuring if you live in the U.S.
0385341679|1.0|In anticipation of this last book in the series, I went back and read the others.  Like a lot of reviewers, I was so excited when I finally sat down to read this. This last book is definitely not worthy of the build-up and hype. I could have used my time to read something better...    I agree with others that this could have been condensed down into 2 or 3 books.  Mac did not grow and evolve, and was one-dimensional.  When we were given a glimpse of Barron's perspective (Chapter 8), I was thrilled to think we would get to know more of his inner-most thoughts, etc.  But this didn't happen, only more of Mac's boring, self-absorbed drivel.      The book bounced all over, I never felt like I got any cohesive storyline from it. I had expected with the time between the books, that this last one would be fantastic, better than the others... no such luck.

1416594795|1.0|As a committed evolutionist, I needed no convincing to buy this book. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. What I thought I would get was a thoughtfully laid out, patiently and cogently explained, clearly written summary of the evidence for evolution, the evidence agaist creationism, and possibly ways to counter creationist arguments. What I got was such a whirlwind hodgepodge I found it to be of no use. Dawkins flits all over the place, with frequent self-indulgent detours via footnotes and parenthetical statments that distract and detract from the main topic. At times I wondered if Dawkins doesn't secretly consider *himself* the pinnacle of the chain of being, since he thinks readers care how he feels about dogs, calculus, his old professors, etc. I just wanted a solid argument of the facts, and what I got was a rough draft written by a middle-schooler with ADD.<br /><br />I also found Dawkins' coining of new words off-putting. \\"Theorum\\" just sounds a bit pweshus--and besides, its pretentiousness is sure to make creationists smirk and evolutionists shake their heads since it still sounds like \\"theory\\" anyhow. And \\"history-deniers\\" makes no sense since the vast preponderance of evolution occurred before there was what we call history. Again you have a term that doesn't appeal to anybody. Why couldn't Dawkins simply have said \\"the system of evolution,\\" and \\"anti-evolutionists\\"? And I'm not even going to delve into why he uses \\"shan't\\" on one page and then a few pages later tells the reader not to be pedantic. Yeah, I know he's British, but seriously, \\"shan't\\" is the verbal equivalent of wearing a celluloid collar.<br /><br />In sum, this is a book you could pick through for interesting paragraphs, but it's not a well-ordered or comprehensive layout of evolution or an assistance in refuting creationists. In no sense is it worth the money unless you're a Dawkins fan and want to read every word he ever wrote. As for me, I wish Carl Sagan were alive to edit this book and give Dawkins a few Ritalin to top it off.Dawkins a few Ritalin to top it off.

1401228801|4.0|Volumes 1-11 of the collected Fables created a likable set of characters, a drama I could care about, and a satisfying finish. Then, Willingham and crew did something that happens only rarely: they rebooted the series, keeping roughly the same cast, but actually did it well. Too often, a series that's lived too long stumbles forward, an illustrated sort of un-dead. This one has taken on a new life.<br /><br />There's a new adversary, one who makes old Gepetto look postively grandfatherly. Factions within the Fable community seem to be polarizing as well, with bids for power and control going on in several different dimensions. Of course, to counter the magical threat they now face, the Fables' witches' guild has a big hand in what goes on - so of course there's tension within that group, too.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the a second story line shows the frog prince living ever after, but not so happily. Being king is bad enough when the subjects come from only one species, but he has a lot more to deal with. Fortunately, he also has at least one of his own kind, a plot thread that I look forward to.<br /><br />This isn't a great place to start reading - this phase of the plot begins back in vol. 12. But, if this is all you have, don't deprive yourself. The authors graciously make it easy for newcomers to catch up.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0810993139|5.0|I found this book from my nephew Logan (who is a lot like me) and I started reading it and LOVED IT.  There were parts in it that I was laughing out loud.  I am a 46 year old man and the idea of reading a book for children seemed odd, but once I got started, I couldn't put it down.  There are so many relatable parts to this book that I can't recommend it enough.  If you like to laugh and enjoy seeing a mirror held up on the childhood that many of us had, you'll love this book.  I quickly read the following 4 books.  They are funny, but not as great as this one.    I've read reviews that had people complaining that there wasn't a strong moral lesson.  There are subtle ones buried in the stories, but this book isn't to teach someone... it is to entertain and in that department, it scores.  Great book!  Thank you for publishing it, and thank you Logan for introducing me to it.

B001GJOL22|4.0|Great concert! Geddy plays like a demon on that bass! To be at the top of your game at 50++ is really something. It's kind of ironic that sound and picture is out of sync. - Especially in the second half. This is baaad editing, and I wonder why quality-control (read: Ged, Neil and Alex) didn't fix this before release. It's a shame, because there are some really remarkable performances on songs like \\"Far cry\\", \\"Earthshine\\", Witch hunt\\" and \\"Spirit of radio\\".

B0000640VN|1.0|This is honestly the worst romance and attempt to comedy ever. Meg Ryan is the most unfitting for her role, I mean only Hugh Jackman was the most decent actor in this movie who made me give this movie a one star because he actually lived the role; everyone else, big thumbs down!!! This movie also is historically inaccurate; the Duke of Albany lived in England, not NYC; and whoever head of a Duke living in the US which is not a British colony anymore in 1876; and the time is set to 1876, whoever heard of Dukes living here in the post-civil war (reconstruction) era! Queen Victoria was this person's mother who accually outlived him! Duhh! Do some research James Mangold! Euckkkkkk! Horrible movie...Do not waste your time and money as I have!
B0030V0PEW|5.0|The word \\"checklist\\" seems boring, but this book shows how these simple tools can make a huge difference in your organization. The author gives great examples from a variety of fields to illustrate how checklists can lead you to achieve higher levels of accuracy and excellence.    A great read for anyone who knows (or wants to know) the value of consistent systems. Highly recommend!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Some of my very favorite movies, Indiana Jones.  The very first movie we were at the movie theatre my husband and I and in the first 10 minutes my husband ate the entire tub of popcorn because of the none stop action at the beginning of that movie.  I just laughed.  It was amazing to watch him, totally mezmerized in that movie.
B003YWUTKW|5.0|If you're of the old skool you grew up with vinyl.  There were no CD's, Mp3's, Mp4's, downloads, modern conveniences we know today.  You had records, tapes, and the radio.  For those of us who cared about music and the formats it came on there is something to be said about a record.  Yea that's right an vinyl album.  Something to be cared about and treasured.  There is something about pulling out a flawless album from it's jacket, putting it on your turntable, meticulously cleaning the record and stylus, and commencing a ritual that provides the listener with a warmth and vigor that no CD will ever be able to reproduce.  When you combine those above statements with freagin' awesome music, what more could a true audiophile ask for.  This record is Chill.  This record is the Orb.  This record is David Gilmore and Pink Floyd.  This record needs to be in your collection!  Buy it on Vinyl, you won't regret it.

0345505387|5.0|I loved outlander,  it was very cool to hear jamie and murtagh's side of the story and the illustrations were beautiful.
B000063V8U|5.0|I was sorry to see this show end, but loved many of the episodes.  I'm glad they tied up some loose ends to previous stories presented throughout the first six seasons, like with Wesley.  I think the two part finale was one of the best of all the trek finales.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|This would have to be without a doubt the worst mvoie that I have ever seen.  How was this allowed to be put on the shelves for sale.  Terrible, Terrible, Terrible.  Jaws had more jumpy moments.
B002MHTHQ2|5.0|This 2 disc compilation contains 4 of Ray's albums, although the most popular being the title which is the first half of the first disc. Genius + Soul is mainly organ instrumentals of Ray Charles swinging to standard jazz/blues arrangements with the Basie orchestra. Ray Charles put soul behind the organ which in no way overpowers the orchestra and perfectly blends into the swing. The number Ray does sing on are some of the strongest pieces like I've Got News for You or I'm Gonna Move, which are two blues songs accompanies by strong organ solos and soulful singing. The greatest song is possibly One Mint Julep, which is a Quincy Jones arrangement and features some of the strongest soloing I've heard in soul music. The other 3 albums included are nowhere near as strong as the first featured, but do have a few good songs. Mainly laid back jazz standards with Ray Charles blending in with the orchestra. The first album is the main reason to buy this, but the other 3 included albums do not hurt this set, only add more value since we are getting more of Ray Charle's recordings from different time periods. So Ray Charle's only main album that he exclusively uses organ as well as the perfect blend of organ soloing and band swing make this one of Ray's strongest ABC albums, and is in my top 5 Ray Charles albums of all time, along with One Mint Julep being in my top 5 Ray Charles songs of all time.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|One would have to watch it half a dozen times I reckon to undertand and take in the full understanding of the movie.  I have watche dit twice now and still find it hard to stay to the end.  May pleae some but not me.
031603438X|1.0|In my opinion, this is a terribly written book. It jumps around, loosing it's train of thought.  And, surprisingly, it's boring.  I can't get through it, and I don't intend to finish it.  Whoever co-wrote the book did Keith no favors.  It seems like he was handed a mike and just rambled on and on.
B003C5FMBM|5.0|It's great to have a digital copy of these old classics. The extra tracks are fun to listen to, but there's a reason they were left off the original release of the record. Really great stuff overall.
